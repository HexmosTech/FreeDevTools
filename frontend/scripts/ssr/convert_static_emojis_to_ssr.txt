18:44:18 [@astrojs/node] Server listening on http://localhost:4321

URL is slightly differnt in this emoji.
https://hexmos.com/freedevtools/emojis/activities/ is a category
Inside activiteis https://hexmos.com/freedevtools/emojis/jack-o-lantern/ is there
but my colleague has made mistkae of not including the cateogy in the URL

All 12k pages of emoji are already insdexd by google, so we need to retain the urls as is and still get it working 

Many of the emoji pages are not working

Working
http://localhost:4321/freedevtools/emojis/
http://localhost:4321/freedevtools/emojis/activities/
http://localhost:4321/freedevtools/emojis/activities/2/#pagination-info


Broken pages
http://localhost:4321/freedevtools/emojis/jack-o-lantern/ this is supposed to be the end page but it is shwoing pagination component in this which is wrong

Not sure why


DO NOT MAKE THIS TRUE, I need SSR only
export const prerender = false;

I dont want static

Read the astro documentation i have given astro mcp aswell @mcp.json 

NPM run preview
