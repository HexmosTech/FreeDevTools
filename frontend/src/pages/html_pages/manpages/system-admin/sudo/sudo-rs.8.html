</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sudo - execute a command as another user

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       sudo [-u <u>user</u>] [-g <u>group</u>] [-D <u>directory</u>] [-BknS] [-i | -s] [VAR=value] [&lt;<u>command</u>&gt;]
       sudo -h | -K | -k | -V

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       sudo  allows  a  user that is permitted to do so to execute a <u>command</u> as another user (for example <u>root</u>).
       Permissions are specified by a security policy specified in <a href="file:/etc/sudoers">/etc/sudoers</a> (see <a href="../man5/sudoers.5.html">sudoers</a>(5)).

       Sudo-rs is a safety oriented and memory safe re-implementation of the  original  sudo  implementation  by
       Todd Miller.

       When  a  command  is  run,  a  session  record  is stored for that specific session allowing users to run
       additional commands without having to re-authenticate.  The timeout for session records can be  specified
       in the policy.

       Some care is taken to pass signals received by sudo-rs to the child process, even if that process runs in
       its own pseudo terminal.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -B, --bell
              Ring the bell as part of the password prompt when a terminal is present.

       -D <u>directory</u>, --chdir=<u>directory</u>
              Run the <u>command</u> in the specified <u>directory</u> instead of the current working directory.  The security
              policy  may  return  an  error  if  the  user  does not have the permission to specify the working
              directory.

       -g <u>group</u>, --group=<u>group</u>
              Use this <u>group</u> as the primary group instead of using the primary group specified in  the  password
              database for the target user.

       -h, --help
              Show a help message.

       -i, --login
              Run the shell specified by the target user’s password database entry as a login shell.  This means
              that  login-specific  resource files such as <u>.profile</u>, <u>.bash_profile</u> or <u>.login</u> will be read by the
              shell.  If a <u>command</u> is specified, it is passed to the shell using the -c option.

       -K, --remove-timestamp
              Removes every cached session record for the user, regardless of where  the  command  is  executed.
              The  next  time  sudo-rs  is  run,  authentication  will take place if the policy requires it.  No
              password is required to run this command.

       -k, --reset-timestamp
              When used without a command, invalidates the user’s session record for the current  session.   The
              next time sudo-rs is run, authentication will take place if the policy requires it.

              When used in conjunction with a <u>command</u> or an option that may require a password, this option will
              cause sudo-rs to ignore the user’s session record.  As a result, authentication will take place if
              the  policy  requires  it.   When  used  in conjunction with a <u>command</u> no invalidation of existing
              session records will take place.

       -n, --non-interactive
              Avoid prompting the user for input of any kind.  If any input is required for the <u>command</u> to  run,
              sudo-rs will display an error message and exit.

       p, --prompt=<u>prompt</u>
              Use  a  custom  authentication prompt with optional escape sequences.  The following percent (`%')
              escape sequences are supported:

                      %H  expanded to the local host name

                      %h  expanded to the local host name without the domain name

                      %p  expanded to the name of the user whose password is being requested
                          (this respects the rootpw, targetpw flags)

                      %U  expanded to the login name of the user the command will be run as
                          (defaults to root unless the -u option is also specified)

                      %u  expanded to the invoking user's login name

                      %%  two consecutive ‘%’ characters are collapsed into a single ‘%’ character

              The custom prompt will override the default  prompt  or  the  one  specified  by  the  SUDO_PROMPT
              enviroment variable.  No <u>prompt</u> will suppress the the prompt provided by PAM, unless the requested
              <u>prompt</u> is empty ("")

       -S, --stdin
              Read from standard input instead of using the terminal device.

       -s, --shell
              Run  the  shell specified by the SHELL environment variable.  If no shell was specified, the shell
              from the user’s password database entry will be used instead.  If a <u>command</u> is  specified,  it  is
              passed to the shell using the -c option.

       -u <u>user</u>, --user=<u>user</u>
              Run the <u>command</u> as another user than the default (<b>root</b>).

       -V, --version
              Display the current version of sudo-rs.

       -v, --validate
              Update the session record for the current session, authenticating the user if necessary.

       --     Indicates the end of the sudo-rs options and start of the <u>command</u>.

       Environment  variables  to  be  set  for  the  command  may  be passed on the command line in the form of
       VAR=value.  Variables passed on the command line are subject to  restrictions  imposed  by  the  security
       policy.   Variables passed on the command line are subject to the same restrictions as normal environment
       variables with one important exception: If the command to be run has the SETENV tag set  or  the  command
       matched  is  ALL,  the user may set variables that would otherwise be forbidden.  See <a href="../man5/sudoers.5.html">sudoers</a>(5) for more
       information.
