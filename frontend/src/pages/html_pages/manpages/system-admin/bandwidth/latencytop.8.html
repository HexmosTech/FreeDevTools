</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       latencytop - a tool for developers to visualize system latencies

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>latencytop</b> [<u>--unknown</u>] [<u>processes</u>...<u>]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>latencytop</b> command.

       <b>latencytop</b>  is  a  Linux*  tool for software developers (both kernel and userspace), aimed at identifying
       where in the system latency is happening, and what kind of operation/action is  causing  the  latency  to
       happen so that the code can be changed to avoid the worst latency hiccups.

       <b>LatencyTOP</b>  focuses  on the cases where the applications want to run and execute useful code, but there's
       some resource that's not currently available (and the kernel then blocks the process). This is done  both
       on  a  system  level  and on a per process level, so that you can see what's happening to the system, and
       which process is suffering and/or causing the delays.

       You can walk the processes by using the cursor keys. If you press <b>s</b>  followed  by  a  letter,  then  only
       active  processes  starting  with that letter are displayed and walked. If you press <b>s</b> followed by <b>0</b> then
       that filter is reset.

       If you press <b>f</b> then <b>LatencyTop</b> displays a list of all processes currently waiting for an <b>fsync</b> to finish.
       Pressing <b>f</b> again returns you to the normal operating mode of <b>LatencyTop</b>.
