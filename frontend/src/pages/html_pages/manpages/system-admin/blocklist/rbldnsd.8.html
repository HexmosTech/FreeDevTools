       rbldnsd - DNS daemon suitable for running DNS-based blocklists

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rbldnsd</b> options <u>zone</u>:<u>dataset</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rbldnsd</b>  is  a  small  DNS-protocol daemon which is designed to handle queries to DNS-based IP-listing or
       NAME-listing services.  Such services are a simple way  to  share/publish  a  list  of  IP  addresses  or
       (domain)  names  which  are  "listed"  for  for  some reason, for example in order to be able to refuse a
       service to a client which is "listed" in some blocklist.

       <b>rbldnsd</b> is not a general-purpose nameserver.  It will answer to A and TXT (and SOA and NS if such RRs are
       specified) queries, and has limited ability to answer to some other types of queries.

       <b>rbldnsd</b> tries to handle data from two different  perspectives:  given  a  set  (or  several)  of  "listed
       entries" (e.g. IP address ranges or domain names), it builds and serves a DNS zone.  Note the two are not
       the same: list of spammer's IPs is NOT a DNS zone, but may be represented and used as such, provided that
       some  additional  information  necessary  to  build  complete  DNS zone (e.g. NS and SOA records, maybe A
       records necessary for http to work) is available.  In this context, <b>rbldnsd</b> is very different from  other
       general-purpose  nameservers  such  as  BIND or NSD: <b>rbldnsd</b> operates with <u>datasets</u> (sets of entries - IP
       addresses or domain names, logically grouped together), while other general-purpose nameservers  operates
       with zones.  The way how <b>rbldnsd</b> operates may be somewhat confusing to BIND experts.

       For  <b>rbldnsd</b>, a building block is a dataset: e.g., set of insecure/abuseable hosts (IP addresses), set of
       network ranges that belongs to various spam operations (IP ranges), domain names that belong to  spammers
       (RHSBL)  and  so  on.   Usually,  different  kind  of  information is placed into separate file, for easy
       maintenance.  From a number of such datasets, <b>rbldnsd</b> constructs a number of DNS zones  as  specified  on
       command  line.  A single dataset may be used for several zones, and a single zone may be constructed from
       several datasets.

       <b>rbldnsd</b> will answer queries to DNS zones specified on the command line as a set of  zone  specifications.
       Each  zone specification consists of zone basename, dataset type and a comma-separated list of files that
       forms a given dataset: <u>zone</u>:<u>type</u>:<u>file</u>,<u>file</u>,...

       Several zones may be specified in command line, so that <b>rbldnsd</b> will  answer  queries  to  any  of  them.
       Also,  a  single zone may be specified several times with different datasets, so it is possible to form a
       zone from a combination of several different dataset.  The same dataset may be reused for  several  zones
       too (and in this case, it will be read into memory only once).

       There  are  several  dataset formats available, each is suitable and optimized (in terms of memory, speed
       and ease of use) for a specific task.   Available  dataset  types  may  be  grouped  into  the  following
       categories:

              lists  of IP addresses.  When a query is done to a zone with such data, query is interpreted as an
              IP address in a reverse form (similar to in-addr.arpa zone).  If the address is found  in  dataset
              data,  <b>rbldnsd</b>  will  return A and TXT records specified in data for that IP.  This is a classical
              IP-based blocklist.

              lists of domain names.  Similar to list of IP addresses, but with generic domain names instead  of
              IPs (wildcards allowed).  This type of data may be used to form a blocklist of e.g.  sender domain
              names.

              generic list of various types of records, as an auxilary data to form a complete nameserver.  This
              format is similar to bind-style datafiles, but very simplified.  One may specify A, TXT, NS and MX
              records here.

              combined set, different datasets from the list above combined in the single (set of) source files,
              for easy maintenance.

              acl,  or  Access Control List.  This is a pseudo dataset, that works by overweriting query results
              based on the requestor (peer) IP address.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options may be specified:

       <b>-u</b> <u>user</u>[:<u>group</u>]
              <b>rbldnsd</b> will change its userid to the specified <u>user</u>, which defaults to <b>rbldns</b>, and  <u>group</u>,  which
              by default is the primary group of a <u>user</u>. <b>rbldnsd</b> will refuse to run as the root user, since this
              is insecure.

       <b>-r</b> <u>rootdir</u>
              <b>rbldnsd</b> will chroot to <u>rootdir</u> if specified.  Data files should be available inside <u>rootdir</u>.

       <b>-w</b> <u>workdir</u>
              <b>rbldnsd</b>  will  change its working directory to <u>workdir</u> (after chrooting to <u>rootdir</u> if <b>-r</b> option is
              also specified).  May be used to shorten filename paths.

       <b>-b</b> <u>address</u>/<u>port</u>
              This option is <u>required</u>.  <b>rbldnsd</b> will bind to specified <u>address</u> and <u>port</u> (port defaults  to  port
              53,  domain).  Either numeric IP address or a hostname may be specified, and either port number or
              service name is accepted.  It is possible to specify several addresses to listen on this  way,  by
              repeating  <b>-b</b> option.  Additionally, if there are several addresses listed for a hostname, <b>rbldnsd</b>
              will listen on all of them.  Note that <b>rbldnsd</b> will work slightly faster  if  only  one  listening
              address is specified.  Note the delimiter between host and port is a slash (/), not a colon, to be
              able to correctly handle IPv6 addresses.

       <b>-4</b>     Use  IPv4  listening  socket/transport,  do  not attempt to use IPv6 (ignored if <b>rbldnsd</b> was built
              without IPv6 support).

       <b>-6</b>     Use IPv6 listening socket/transport, do not attempt to use IPv4 (this option will be  reported  as
              error if IPv6 support was not compiled in).

       <b>-t</b> <u>defttl</u>:<u>minttl</u>:<u>maxttl</u>
              Set default reply time-to-live (TTL) value to be <u>defttl</u>, and set constraints for TTL to <u>minttl</u> and
              <u>maxttl</u>.   Default  applies  when  there's  no  TTL  defined  in  a given scope (in data file), and
              constraints are applied when such value provided in data.  Any  of  the  values  may  be  omitted,
              including  trailing  colon  (:)  characters,  e.g.  "<b>-t</b> 30"  set default TTL to be 30 secound, and
              "<b>-t</b> ::120" or "<b>-t</b> ::2m" sets maximum allowed TTL to 2 minutes.  All 3 values are  in  time  units,
              with  optional suffix: <b>s</b> (secounds, default), <b>m</b> (minutes), <b>h</b> (hours), <b>d</b> (days) or <b>w</b> (weeks).  Zero
              <u>minttl</u> or maxttl means no corresponding constraint will be enforced.  Default <u>defttl</u> is 35m.

       <b>-c</b> <u>check</u>
              Set interval between checking for zone file changes to be  <u>check</u>,  default  is  1m  (one  minute).
              <b>rbldnsd</b>  will check zone file's last modification time every so often, and if it detects a change,
              zone will be automatically reloaded.  Setting this value  to  0  disables  automatic  zone  change
              detection.   This  procedure  may  also  be  triggered  by sending a SIGHUP signal to <b>rbldnsd</b> (see
              SIGNALS section below).

       <b>-e</b>     Allow non-network addresses to be used in CIDR ranges.  Normally, <b>rbldnsd</b> rejects  addresses  such
              as  127.2.3.4/24,  where  prefix  is  not within the network mask derived from bit number (in this
              case, correct form is 127.2.3.0/24, note the trailing zero in prefix).  This is done in  order  to
              catch  possible  typos  in  zones  (<b>rbldnsd</b> will warn about a problem and will ignore such entry).
              This option disables checking whether the CIDR prefix fits within the network mask.

       <b>-q</b>     Quick and quiet start.  Normally, <b>rbldnsd</b> does socket initialization and zone load in  foreground,
              writing  progress  and  statistic to standard output, and aborts in case of any errors.  With this
              flag, nothing will be printed and first zone load will be done in background (unless <b>-n</b> option  is
              also given), and zone load errors will be non-fatal.

       <b>-p</b> <u>pidfile</u>
              Write  rbldnsd's  pid  to  the  specified  <u>pidfile</u>, so it will be easily findable.  This file gets
              written before entering a chroot jail (if specified) and before changing userid,  so  it's  ok  to
              specify e.g. /var/run/rbldnsd.pid here.

       <b>-l</b> <u>logfile</u>
              Specifies  a  file  to  which log all requests made.  This file is created after entering a chroot
              jail and becoming a user.  Logfiles may be quite large, esp. on busy sites (<b>rbldnsd</b> will log <u>every</u>
              recognized request if this option is specified).  This option is  mainly  intended  for  debugging
              purposes.   Upon  receiption  of  SIGHUP signal, <b>rbldnsd</b> reopens its logfile.  If <u>logfile</u> prefixed
              with a plus sign (+), logging will not be buffered (i.e. each line will be flushed  to  disk);  by
              default,  logging is buffered to reduce system load.  Specify a single hyphen (-) as a filename to
              log to standard output (filedescriptor  1),  either  buffered  by  default,  or  line-buffered  if
              specified  as  `+-' (standard output will not be "reopened" upon receiving SIGHUP signal, but will
              be flushed in case logging is buffered).

       <b>-s</b> <u>statsfile</u>
              Specifies a file where <b>rbldnsd</b> will write a line with short statistic summary of queries made  per
              zone, every check (<b>-c</b>) interval.  Format of each line is:
                <u>timestamp</u> <u>zone</u>:<u>qtot</u>:<u>qok</u>:<u>qnxd</u>:<u>bin</u>:<u>bout</u> <u>zone</u>:...
              where  <u>timestamp</u>  is  unix time (secounds since epoch), <u>zone</u> is the name of the base zone, <u>qtot</u> is
              the total number of queries received, <u>qok</u> - number of positive replies, <u>qnxd</u> - number of  NXDOMAIN
              replies, <u>bin</u> is the total number of bytes read from network (excluding IP/UDP overhead and dropped
              packets),  <u>bout</u>  is the total number of bytes written to network.  Ther are as many such tuples as
              there are zones, and one extra, total typle at the end, with <u>zone</u> being "*", like:
                1234 bl1.ex:10:5:4:311:432 bl2.ex:24:13:7:248:375 *:98:35:12:820:987
              Note the total values may be larger than the sum of per-zone values, due to queries  made  against
              unlisted zones, or bad/broken packets.

              <b>Rbldnsd</b>  will  write  bare  timestamp  to  <u>statsfile</u> when it is starting up, shutting down or when
              statistic counters are being reset after receiving SIGUSR2 signal (see  below),  to  indicate  the
              points where the counters are starting back from zero.

              By default, <b>rbldnsd</b> writes absolute counter values into <u>statsfile</u> (number of packets (bytes) since
              startup  or last reset).  <u>statsfile</u> may be prefixed with plus sign (+), in which case <b>rbldnsd</b> will
              write delta values, that is, number of packets or bytes since last write,  or  number  of  packets
              (bytes) per unit of time ("incremental" mode, hence the "+" sign).

       <b>-n</b>     Do  not  become  a  daemon.  Normally, <b>rbldnsd</b> will fork and go to the background after successful
              initialization.  This option disables this behaviour.

       <b>-f</b>     Request <b>rbldnsd</b> to continue processing requests  during  data  reloads.   <b>Rbldnsd</b>  forks  a  child
              process  to  handle  requests  while parent reloads the data.  This ensures smooth operations, but
              requires more memory, since two copies of data is keept in memory during reload process.

       <b>-d</b>     Dump all zones to stdout in BIND format and exit.  This may be suitable to convert easily editable
              rbldnsd-style data into BIND zone.  <b>rbldnsd</b> dumps all zones as one stream,  so  one  may  want  to
              specify  only  one  zone  with  <b>-d</b>.  Zone file will have appropriate $ORIGIN tags.  Note that data
              generated may be really huge (as BIND format isn't appropriate for this sort of things), and  some
              entries may not be really the same in BIND as in <b>rbldnsd</b> (e.g., IP netblocks of large size will be
              represented  as  wildcard  entries  -  10.0.0.0/8  will  become  *.10;  excluded  entries  will be
              represented by a CNAME to `excluded' name, so such name should not be present in a data set).   In
              this mode, <b>rbldnsd</b> ignores <b>-r</b> (root directory) option.

       <b>-v</b>     Do  not  show  exact  version  information  in response to version.bind CH TXT queries (by default
              <b>rbldnsd</b> responds to such queries since version 0.98).  With single <b>-v</b>, <b>rbldnsd</b>  will  only  return
              "rbldnsd" to the caller, without the version number.  Second <b>-v</b> disables providing any information
              in response to such requests, i.e. <b>rbldnsd</b> will return REFUSE code.

       <b>-C</b>     Disable  automatic  on-the-fly  uncompression  of  data  files if this feature is compiled in (see
              below).

       <b>-A</b>

       <b>-a</b>     Controls "laziness" of <b>rbldnsd</b> when constructing replies.  With <b>-a</b> specified, <b>rbldnsd</b> does not add
              AUTH section (containing NS records) to replies unless explicitly asked for  NS  records.   It  is
              equivalent  to  BIND9  "minimal-answers"  configuration setting.  While with <b>-A</b> specified, <b>rbldnsd</b>
              will always fill in AUTH section, increasing size of replies dramatically but  allowing  (caching)
              resolver clients to react faster to changes in nameserver lists.  Currently (as of 0.998 version),
              non-lazy (as with <b>-A</b>) mode is the default, but it will change in future release.

       <b>-x</b> <u>extension</u>
              Load  the  given  <u>extension</u>  file (a dynamically-linked library, usually with ".so" suffix).  This
              allows to gather custom statistics or perform other  custom  tasks.   See  separate  document  for
              details  about building and using extensions.  This feature is not available on all platforms, and
              can be disabled at compile time.

       <b>-X</b> <u>extarg</u>
              Pass the given argument, <u>extarg</u>, to the extension loaded with <b>-x</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DATASET</b> <b>TYPES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       Dataset files are text files which are interpreted depending on type specified in  command  line.   Empty
       lines  and lines starting with hash character (#) or semicolon (;) are ignored, except for a special case
       outlined below in section titled "Special Entries".

       A (comma-separated) list of files in dataset specification (in <u>type</u>:<u>file</u>,<u>file</u>,...) is interpreted  as  if
       all files where logically combined into one single file.

       When  compiled  with zlib support, <b>rbldnsd</b> is able to read gzip-compressed data files.  So, every <u>file</u> in
       dataset specification can be compressed with <b><a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a></b>(1), and <b>rbldnsd</b> will read such a file decompressing  it
       on-the-fly.  This feature may be turned off by specifying <b>-C</b> option.

       <b>rbldnsd</b>  is  designed  to  service a DNSBL, where each entry have single A record and optional TXT record
       assotiated with it.  <b>rbldnsd</b>  allows  to  specify  A  value  and  TXT  <u>template</u>  either  for  each  entry
       individually,  or  to  use  default  A  value  and TXT template pair for a group of entries.  See section
       "Resulting A values and TXT templates" below for a way to specify them.

   <b>Special</b> <b>Entries</b>
       If a line starts with a dollar sign ($), hash character and a dollar sign (#$), semicolon and dollar sign
       (;#) or colon and a dollar sign (:$), it is interpreted in a special  way,  regardless  of  dataset  type
       (this  is one exception where a line starting with hash character is not ignored - to be able to use zone
       files for both <b>rbldnsd</b> and for DJB's rbldns). The  following  keywords,  following  a  dollar  sign,  are
       recognized:

       <b>$SOA</b> <u>ttl</u> <u>origindn</u> <u>persondn</u> <u>serial</u> <u>refresh</u> <u>retry</u> <u>expire</u> <u>minttl</u>
              Specifies SOA (Start Of Authority) record for all zones using this dataset.  Only first SOA record
              is  interpreted.   This  is the only way to specify SOA - by default, <b>rbldnsd</b> will not add any SOA
              record into answers, and will REFUSE to answer to certain queries (notably, SOA  query  to  zone's
              base domain name).  It is recommended, but not mandatory to specify SOA record for every zone.  If
              no  SOA  is given, negative replies will not be cacheable by caching nameservers.  Only one, first
              $SOA line is recognized in every dataset (all  subsequent  $SOA  lines  encountered  in  the  same
              dataset  are  silently  ignored).   When constructing a zone, SOA will be taken from <u>first</u> dataset
              where $SOA line is found, in an order as specified in command line, subsequent $SOA lines, if any,
              are ignored.  This way, one may overwrite $SOA found in 3rd party data by <u>prepending</u>  small  local
              file to the dataset in question, listing it before any other files.

              If  <u>serial</u>  value specified is zero, timestamp of most recent modified file will be substituted as
              <u>serial</u>.

              If <u>ttl</u> field is zero, default ttl (<b>-t</b> option or last <b>$TTL</b> value, see below) will be used.

              All time fields (ttl, refresh, retry, expire, minttl) may be specified  in  time  units.   See  <b>-t</b>
              option for details.

       <b>$NS</b> <u>ttl</u> <u>nameserverdn</u> <u>nameserverdn...</u>
              Specifies  NS  (Name  Server)  records for all zones using this dataset.  Only first $NS line in a
              dataset is recognized, all subsequent lines are silently ignored.  When constructing a  zone  from
              several  datasets,  rbldnsd uses nameservers from $NS line in only first dataset where $NS line is
              given, in command-line order, just like for $SOA record.  Only first 32 namservers are recognized.
              Individual nameserver(s) may be prefixed with a minus sign (-), which means this single nameserver
              will be ignored by <b>rbldnsd</b>.  This is useful to temporary comment out one nameserver entry  without
              removing  it  from  the  list.  If <u>ttl</u> is zero, default ttl will be used.  The list of NS records,
              just like $SOA value, are taken from the <u>first</u> data file in a dataset where the $NS line is found,
              subsequent $NS lines, if any, are ignored.

       <b>$TTL</b> <u>time-to-live</u>
              Specifies TTL (time-to-live) value for all records in current dataset.  See also <b>-t</b> option.   <b>$TTL</b>
              special overrides <b>-t</b> value on a per-dataset basis.

       <b>$TIMESTAMP</b> <u>dstamp</u> [<u>expires</u>]
              (experimental)  Specifies  the  data  timestamp  <u>dstamp</u>  when  the  data  has  been generated, and
              optionally when it will expire.  The timestamps are in form <u>yyyy</u>:<u>mm</u>:<u>dd</u>[:<u>hh</u>[:<u>mi</u>[:<u>ss</u>]]], where  <u>yyyy</u>
              is the year like 2005, <u>mm</u> is the month number (01..12), <u>dd</u> is the month day number (01..31), <u>hh</u> is
              hour  (00..23),  <u>mi</u>  and  <u>ss</u>  are  minutes  and  secounds (00.59); hours, minutes and secounds are
              optional and defaults to 0; the delimiters (either colon or dash may be used)  are  optional  too,
              but  are  allowed for readability.  Also, single zero (0) or dash (-) may be used as <u>dstamp</u> and/or
              <u>expires</u>, indicating the value is not given.  <u>expires</u> may also be specified as <b>+</b><u>rel</u>, where <u>rel</u> is a
              time specification (probably with suffix like s, m,  h,  d)  as  an  offset  to  <u>dstamp</u>.   <b>rbldnsd</b>
              compares  <u>dstamp</u>  with  current timestamp and refuses to load the file if <u>dstamp</u> specifies time in
              the future.  And if <u>expires</u> is specified, <b>rbldnsd</b> will refuse to service requests for that data if
              current time is greather than the value specified in <u>expires</u> field.

              Note that <b>rbldnsd</b> will check the data expiry time every time it checks for data file updates (when
              receiving SIGHUP signal or every <b>-c</b> interval).  If automatic data  reload  timer  (<b>-c</b>  option)  is
              disabled, zones will not be exipired automatically.

       <b>$MAXRANGE4</b> <u>range-size</u>
              Specifies  maximum size of IPv4 range allowed for IPv4-based datasets.  If an entry covers more IP
              addresses than <u>range-size</u>, it will be ignored (and a warning will be logged).  <u>range-size</u>  may  be
              specified  as  a number of hosts, like 256, or as network prefix lenght, like /24 (the two are the
              same):
                $MAXRANGE4 /24
                $MAXRANGE4 256
              This constraint is active for a dataset it is specified in, and can be owerwritten (by  subsequent
              $MAXRANGE statement) by a smaller value, but can not be increased.

       <b>$</b><u>n</u> <u>text</u>
              (<u>n</u>  is  a  single  digit).   Specifies  a <u>substitution</u> <u>variable</u> for use as $<u>n</u> placeholders (the <b>$</b><u>n</u>
              entries are ignored in generic daaset).  See section "Resulting A values and TXT templates"  below
              for description and usage examples.

       <b>$=</b> <u>text</u>
              Set  the  base  template  for all individual TXT records.  See section "Resulting A values and TXT
              templates" below for more information.

   <b>ip4set</b> <b>Dataset</b>
       A set of IP addresses or CIDR address ranges, together with A and TXT resulting values.  IP addresses are
       specified one per line, by an IP address prefix (initial octets), complete IP address, CIDR range, or  IP
       prefix  range  (two  IP  prefixes  or  complete  addresses delimited by a dash, inclusive).  Examples, to
       specify 127.0.0.0/24:
         127.0.0.0/24
         127.0.0
         127/24
         127-127.0.0
         127.0.0.0-127.0.0.255
         127.0.0.1-255
       to specify 127.16.0.0-127.31.255.255:
         127.16.0.0-127.31.255.255
         127.16.0-127.31.255
         127.16-127.31
         127.16-31
         127.16.0.0/12
         127.16.0/12
         127.16/12
       Note that in prefix range, last boundary is completed with all-ones (255), not all-zeros line with  first
       boundary  and  a  prefix  alone.  In prefix ranges, if last boundary is only one octet (127.16-31), it is
       treated as "suffix", as value of last <u>specified</u> octet  of  the  first  boundary  prefix  (127.16.0-31  is
       treated as 127.16.0.0-127.16.31.255, i.e.  127.16.0.0/19).

       After  an  IP address range, A and TXT values for a given entry may be specified.  If none given, default
       values in current scope (see below) applies.  If a value starts with a colon, it is interpreted as a pair
       of A record and TXT template, delimited by colon (:127.0.0.2:This entry is listed).  If a value does  not
       start  with  a  colon,  it is interpreted as TXT template only, with A record defaulting to the default A
       value in current scope.

       IP address range may be followed by a comment char (either hash character (#) or semicolon (;)), e.g.:
         127/8 ; loopback network
       In this case all characters up to the end of line are ignored, and default A and TXT values will be  used
       for this IP range.

       Every  IP  address  that  fits  within  any  of specified ranges is "listed", and <b>rbldnsd</b> will respond to
       reverse queries against it within specified zone with positive results.  In contrast, if an entry  starts
       with  an  exclamation  sign (!), this is an <u>exclusion</u> entry, i.e. corresponding address range is excluded
       from being listed (and any value for this record is ignored).  This may be used to  specify  large  range
       except some individual addresses, in a compact form.

       If  a  line  starts  with a colon (:), this line specifies the default A value and TXT template to return
       (see below) for all subsequent entries up to end of current file.  If no default entry specified, and  no
       value  specified  for  a given record, <b>rbldnsd</b> will return 127.0.0.2 for matching A queries and no record
       for matching TXT queries.  If TXT record template is specified and contains occurences of of dollar  sign
       ($),  every  such occurence is replaced with an IP address in question, so singe TXT template may be used
       to e.g. refer to a webpage for an additional information for a specific IP address.

   <b>ip4trie</b> <b>Dataset</b>
       Set of IP4 CIDR ranges with corresponding (A, TXT) values.  This dataset is similar to ip4set, but uses a
       different internal representation.  It accepts CIDR ranges only (not a.b.c.d-e.f.g.h), and allows for the
       specification of A/TXT values on a per CIDR range basis.  (If multiple CIDR ranges  match  a  query,  the
       value for longest matching prefix is returned.)  Exclusions are supported too.

       This  dataset  is  not particularly memory-efficient for storing many single IP addresses — it uses about
       50% more memory than the ip4set dataset in that case.  The ip4trie dataset is  better  adapted,  however,
       for listing CIDR ranges (whose lengths are not a multiple of 8 bits.)

   <b>ip4tset</b> <b>Dataset</b>
       "trivial"  ip4set:  a  set  of  single  IP  addresses (one per line), with the same A+TXT template.  This
       dataset type is more efficient than ip4set (in both memory usage and  access  times),  but  have  obvious
       limitation.   It  is  intended  for DNSBLs like DSBL.org, ORDB.org and similar, where each entry uses the
       same default A+TXT template.  This dataset uses only half a memory for the  same  list  of  IP  addresses
       compared to <b>ip4set</b>.

   <b>ip6trie</b> <b>Dataset</b>
       Set of IP6 CIDR ranges.  This is the IP6 equivalent of the ip4trie dataset.  It allows the sepecification
       of  individual  A/TXT values for each CIDR range and supports exclusions.  Compressed ("::") ip6 notation
       is supported.

       Example zone data:
         # Default A and TXT template valuse
         :127.0.1.2: Listed, see <a href="http://example.com/lookup">http://example.com/lookup</a>?$

         # A listing, note that trailing :0s can be omitted
         2001:21ab:c000/36

         # /64 range with non-default A and TXT values
         2001:21ab:def7:4242 :127.0.1.3: This one smells funny

         # compressed notation
         2605:6001:42::/52
         ::1                   # localhost
         !2605:6001:42::bead   # exclusion

   <b>ip6tset</b> <b>Dataset</b>
       "Trivial" ip6 dataset: a set of /64 IP6 CIDR ranges (one per line), all sharing a single A+TXT  template.
       Exclusions  of  single  IP6  (/128)  addresses  are  also  supported.  This dataset type is quite memory-
       efficient — it uses about 40% of the memory that  the  ip6trie  dataset  would  use  —  but  has  obvious
       limitations.

       This dataset wants the /64s listed as four ip6 words, for example:
         2001:20fe:23:41ed
         abac:adab:ad00:42f
       Exclusions  are  denoted  with a leading exclamation mark.  You may also use compressed "::" notation for
       excluded addresses.  E.g.:
         !abac:adab:ad00:42f:face:0f:a:beef
         !abac:adab:ad00:42f::2

   <b>dnset</b> <b>Dataset</b>
       Set of (possible wildcarded) domain names with associated A and  TXT  values.   Similar  to  <b>ip4set</b>,  but
       instead  of IP addresses, data consists of domain names (<u>not</u> in reverse form).  One domain name per line,
       possible starting with wildcard (either  with  star-dot  (*.)  or  just  a  dot).   Entry  starting  with
       exclamation  sign  is  exclusion.   Default  value  for  all  subsequent lines may be specified by a line
       starting with a colon.

       Wildcards are interpreted as follows:

       example.com
              only example.com domain is listed, not subdomains thereof.  Not a wildcard entry.

       *.example.com
              all subdomains of example.com are listed, but not example.com itself.

       .example.com
              all subdomains of example.com <u>and</u> example.com itself are listed.  This is a shortcut:  to  list  a
              domain  name  itself  and  all  it's subdomains, one may either specify two lines (example.com and
              *.example.com), or one line (.example.com).

       This dataset type may be used instead of <b>ip4set</b>, provided all CIDR ranges are expanded and reversed  (but
       in this case, TXT template will be expanded differently).

   <b>generic</b> <b>Dataset</b>
       Generic  type,  simplified bind-style format.  Every record should be on one line (line continuations are
       not supported), and  should  be  specified  completely  (i.e.  all  domain  names  in  values  should  be
       fully-qualified, entry name may not be omitted).  No wildcards are accepted.  Only A, TXT, and MX records
       are recognized.  TTL value may be specified before record type.  Examples:

               # bl.ex.com
               # specify some values for current zone
               $NS 0 ns1.ex.com ns2.ex.com
               # record with TTL
               www 3000 A 127.0.0.1
               about TXT "ex.com combined blocklist"

   <b>combined</b> <b>Dataset</b>
       This  is  a  special  dataset  that  stores no data by itself but acts like a container for several other
       datasets of any type except of combined type itself.  The data file contains an optional common  section,
       where various specials are recognized like $NS, $SOA, $TTL (see above), and a series of sections, each of
       which  defines  one (nested) dataset and several subzones of the base zone, for which this dataset should
       be consulted.  New (nested) dataset starts with a line
         $DATASET <u>type</u>[:<u>name</u>] <u>subzone</u> <u>subzone</u>...
       and all subsequent lines up to the end of current file or to next $DATASET line are interpreted as a part
       of dataset of type <u>type</u>, with optional <u>name</u> (name is used  for  logging  purposes  only,  and  the  whole
       ":<u>name</u>"  (without  quotes  or  square brackets) part is optional).  Note that combined datasets cannot be
       nested.  Every <u>subzone</u> will always be relative to the base zone  name  specified  on  command  line.   If
       <u>subzone</u> specified as single character "@", dataset will be connected to the base zone itself.

       This  dataset  type aims to simplify subzone maintenance, in order to be able to include several subzones
       in one file for easy data transfer, atomic operations and to be able to modify list of subzones on remote
       secondary nameservers.

       Example of a complete dataset that contains subzone `proxies'  with  a  list  of  open  proxies,  subzone
       `relays'  with a list of open relays, subzone `multihop' with output IPs of multihop open relays, and the
       base zone itself includes proxies and relays but not multihops:
         # common section
         $NS 1w ns1.ex.com ns2.ex.com
         $SOA 1w ns1.ex.com admin.ex.com 0 2h 2h 1w 1h
         # list of open proxies,
         # in `proxies' subzone and in base zone

         127.0.0.2
         127.0.9.12
         # for the base zone and all subzones,
         # include several additional records
         $DATASET generic:common proxies relays multihop @
         @ A 127.0.0.8
         www A 127.0.0.8
         @ MX 10 mx.ex.com
         # the above results in having the following records
         # (provided that the base zone specified is bl.ex.com):
         #  proxies.bl.ex.com A 127.0.0.8
         #  www.proxies.bl.ex.com 127.0.0.8
         #  relays.bl.ex.com A 127.0.0.8
         #  www.relays.bl.ex.com 127.0.0.8

         #  www.multihop.bl.ex.com 127.0.0.8
         #  bl.ex.com A 127.0.0.8
         #  www.bl.ex.com 127.0.0.8

       Note that $NS and $SOA values applies to the base zone <u>only</u>, regardless of the  placement  in  the  file.
       Unlike  the  $TTL  values  and  $<u>n</u>  substitutions,  which  may  be  both  global  and  local  for a given
       (sub-)dataset.

   <b>Resulting</b> <b>A</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>TXT</b> <b>templates</b>
       In all zone file types except generic, A values and TXT templates are specified as following:
         :127.0.0.2:Blacklisted: <a href="http://example.com/bl">http://example.com/bl</a>?$
       If a line starts with a colon, it specifies default A and TXT for all subsequent entries in this dataset.
       Similar format is used to specify values for individual records, with the A value  (enclosed  by  colons)
       being optional:
         127.0.0.2 :127.0.0.2:Blacklisted: <a href="http://example.com/bl">http://example.com/bl</a>?$
       or, without specific A value:
         127.0.0.2 Blacklisted: <a href="http://example.com/bl">http://example.com/bl</a>?$

       Two  parts  of  a line, delimited by second colon, specifies A and TXT record values.  Both are optional.
       By default (either if no default line specified, or no IP address within that line), <b>rbldnsd</b> will  return
       127.0.0.2 as A record.  127.0.0 prefix for A value may be omitted, so the above example may be simplified
       to:
         :2:Blacklisted: <a href="http://example.com/bl">http://example.com/bl</a>?$
       There  is  no  default  TXT  value,  so <b>rbldnsd</b> will not return anything for TXT queries unless TXT isn't
       specified.

       When A value is specified for a given entry, but  TXT  template  is  omitted,  there  may  be  two  cases
       interpreted  differently,  namely, whenever there's a second semicolon (:) after the A value.  If there's
       no second semicolon, default TXT value for this scope will be used.  In contrast, when  second  semicolon
       is  present,  no TXT template will be generated at all.  All possible cases are outlined in the following
       example:

         # default A value and TXT template
         :127.0.0.2:IP address $ is listed
         # 127.0.0.4 will use default A and TXT
         127.0.0.4
         # 127.0.0.5 will use specific A and default TXT
         127.0.0.5 :5
         # 127.0.0.6 will use specific a and <u>no</u> TXT
         127.0.0.6 :6:
         # 127.0.0.7 will use default A and specific TXT
         127.0.0.7 IP address $ running an open relay

       In a TXT template, references to substitution variables are replaced with values of that  variables.   In
       particular,  single dollar sign ($) is replaced by a listed entry (an IP address in question for IP-based
       datasets and the domain name for domain-based datasets).  <b>$</b><u>n</u>-style constructs, where <u>n</u> is a single digit,
       are replaced by a substitution variable $<u>n</u> defined  for  this  dataset  in  current  scope  (see  section
       "Special Entries" above).  To specify a dollar sign as-is, use <b>$$</b>.

       For example, the following lines:
         $1 See <a href="http://www.example.com/bl">http://www.example.com/bl</a>
         $2 for details
         127.0.0.2  $1/spammer/$ $2
         127.0.0.3  $1/relay/$ $2
         127.0.0.4  This spammer wants some $$$$.  $1/$
       will result in the following text to be generated:
         See <a href="http://www.example.com/bl/spammer/127.0.0.2">http://www.example.com/bl/spammer/127.0.0.2</a> for details
         See <a href="http://www.example.com/bl/relay/127.0.0.3">http://www.example.com/bl/relay/127.0.0.3</a> for details
         This spammer wants some $$.  See <a href="http://www.example.com/bl/127.0.0.4">http://www.example.com/bl/127.0.0.4</a>

       If  the "base template" (<b>$=</b> variable) is defined, this template is used for expansion, instead of the one
       specified for an entry being queried.  Inside the base template, <b>$=</b> construct  is  substituted  with  the
       text  given for individual entries. In order to stop usage of base template <b>$=</b> for a single record, start
       it with <b>=</b> (which will be omitted from the resulting TXT value).  For example,
         $= See <a href="http://www.example.com/bl">http://www.example.com/bl</a>?$= ($) for details
         127.0.0.2 r123
         127.0.0.3
         127.0.0.4 =See other blocklists for details about $
       produces the following TXT records:
         See <a href="http://www.example.com/bl">http://www.example.com/bl</a>?r123 (127.0.0.2) for details
         See <a href="http://www.example.com/bl">http://www.example.com/bl</a>?127.0.0.3 (127.0.0.3) for details
         See other blocklists for details about 127.0.0.4

   <b>acl</b> <b>Dataset</b>
       This is not a real dataset, while the syntax and usage is the same as with other  datasets.   Instead  of
       defining  which  records  exists in a given zone and which do not, the <b>acl</b> dataset specifies which client
       hosts (peers) are allowed to query the given zone.  The dataset specifies a set of IPv4 and/or IPv6  CIDR
       ranges  (with  the  syntax  exactly the same as understood by the <b>ip4trie</b> and <b>ip6trie</b> datasets), together
       with action specifiers.  When a query is made from an IP address listed (not <u>for</u>  the  IP  address),  the
       specified action changes rules used to construct the reply.  Possible actions and their meanings are:

       :<b>ignore</b>
              ignore all queries from this IP address altogether.  <b>rbldnsd</b> acts like there was no query received
              at all.  This is the default action.

       :<b>refuse</b>
              refuse all queries from the IP in question.  <b>rbldnsd</b> will always return REFUSED DNS response code.

       :<b>empty</b> pretend there's no data in all other datasets for the given zone.  This means that all the clients
              in question will always receive reply from <b>rbldnsd</b> telling that the requested IP address or domain
              name  is  not  listed  in  a  given  DNSBL.  <b>rbldnsd</b> still replies to metadata queries (SOA and NS
              records, and to all queries satisfied by generic dataset if  specified  for  the  given  zone)  as
              usual.

       :<b>pass</b>  process  the  request as usual.  This may be used to add a "whitelisting" entry for a network/host
              bloked by another (larger) ACL entry.

       <u>a_txt_template</u>
              usual A+TXT template as used by other datasets.  This means that <b>rbldnsd</b> will reply to  any  valid
              DNSBL  query  with "it is listed" answer, so that the client in question will see every IP address
              or domain name is listed in a given DNSBL.  TXT record used in the reply is  taken  from  the  acl
              dataset  instead  of  real  datasets.   Again,  just  like  with <b>empty</b> case, <b>rbldnsd</b> will continue
              replying to metadata queries (including generic datasets if any) as usual.

       Only one ACL dataset can be specified for a given zone, and each zone must  have  at  least  one  non-acl
       dataset.   It is also possible to specify one global ACL dataset, by specifying empty zone name (which is
       not allowed for other dataset types), like
         <b>rbldnsd</b> ... :<b>acl</b>:<u>filename</u>...
       In this case the ACL defined in <u>filename</u> applies to all zones.  If there are both global  ACL  and  local
       zone-specific  ACL  specified, both will be consulted and actions taken in the order specified above, ie,
       if either ACL returns <b>ignore</b> for this IP, the request will be ignored, else if either ACL returns <b>refuse</b>,
       the query will be refused, and so on.  If both ACLs specifies "always listed" A+TXT template,  the  reply
       will contain A+TXT from global ACL.

       For  this dataset type, only a few $-style specials are recognized.  In particular, $SOA and $NS keywords
       are not allowed.  When <b>rbldnsd</b> performs <b>$</b> substitution in the TXT template returned from ACL dataset,  it
       will  use  client  IP address to substitute for a single $ character, instead of the IP address or domain
       name found in the original query.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Rbldnsd</b> handles the following signals:

       <b>SIGHUP</b> recheck zone files and reload any outdated ones.  This is done automatically if  enabled,  see  <b>-c</b>
              option.   Additionally,  <b>rbldnsd</b>  will  reopen  logfile  upon  receiving  SIGHUP, if specified (<b>-l</b>
              option).

       <b>SIGTERM</b>, <b>SIGINT</b>
              Terminate process.

       <b>SIGUSR1</b>
              Log current statistic counters into syslog.  <b>Rbldnsd</b> collects how many  packets  it  handled,  how
              many  bytes  was  received,  sent,  how many OK requests/replies (and how many answer records) was
              received/sent, how many NXDOMAIN answers was sent, and how many errors/refusals/etc was sent, in a
              period of time.

       <b>SIGUSR2</b>
              The same as SIGUSR1, but reset all counters and start new sample period.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Some unsorted usage notes follows.

   <b>Generating</b> <b>and</b> <b>transferring</b> <b>data</b> <b>files</b>
       When creating a data file for <b>rbldnsd</b> (and for anything else, it is a general advise), it is a good  idea
       to  create  the  data in temporary file and rename the temp file when all is done.  <u>Never</u> try to write to
       the main file directly, it is possible that at the same time, <b>rbldnsd</b> will try to read it  and  will  get
       incomplete  data  as  the  result.   The  same  applies  to  copying data using <b><a href="../man1/cp.1.html">cp</a></b>(1) utility and similar
       (including <b><a href="../man1/scp.1.html">scp</a></b>(1)), that performs copying over existing data.  Even if you're sure noone is  reading  the
       data  while you're copying or generating it, imagine what will happen if you will not be able to complete
       the process for whatever reason (interrupt, filesystem full, endless number  of  other  reasons...).   In
       most cases is better to keep older but correct data instead of leaving incomplete/corrupt data in place.

       Right:
         scp remote:data target.tmp &amp;&amp; mv target.tmp target
       <u>Wrong</u>:
         scp remote:data target
       Right:
         ./generate.pl &gt; target.tmp &amp;&amp; mv target.tmp target
       <u>Wrong</u>:
         ./generate.pl &gt; target

       From  this  point  of  view,  <b><a href="../man1/rsync.1.html">rsync</a></b>(1)  command seems to be safe, as it <u>always</u> creates temporary file and
       renames it to the destination only when all is ok (but note the  --partial  option,  which  is  good  for
       downloading  something but may be wrong to transfer data files -- usually you don't want partial files to
       be loaded).  In contrast, <b><a href="../man1/scp.1.html">scp</a></b>(1) command is <u>not</u> safe, as it performs direct copying.  You may  still  use
       <b><a href="../man1/scp.1.html">scp</a></b>(1) in a safe manner, as shown in the example above.

       Also  try  to  eliminate a case when two (or more) processes performs data copying/generation at the same
       time to the same destination.  When your data is generated by  a  cron  job,  use  file  locking  (create
       separate  lock file (which should never be removed) and flock/fcntl it in exclusive mode without waiting,
       exiting if lock fails) before attempting to do other file manipulation.

   <b>Absolute</b> <b>vs</b> <b>relative</b> <b>domain</b> <b>names</b>
       All <u>keys</u> specified in dataset files are always relative to the zone base DN.  In contrast, all the <u>values</u>
       (NS and SOA records, MX records in generic dataset) are absolute.  This is different from BIND behaviour,
       where trailing dot indicates whenever this is an absolute or relative DN.  Trailing dots in domain  names
       are ignored by <b>rbldnsd</b>.

   <b>Aggregating</b> <b>datasets</b>
       Several  zones  may be served by <b>rbldnsd</b>, every zone may consist of several datasets.  There are numerous
       ways to combine several data files into several zones.  For example, suppose you have a  list  of  dialup
       ranges  in  file named `dialups', and a list of spammer's ip addresses in file named `spammers', and want
       to serve 3 zones with <b>rbldnsd</b>: dialups.bl.ex.com, spam.bl.ex.com and bl.ex.com which is a combination  of
       the two.  There are two ways to do this:

        rbldnsd <u>options...</u> \
          dialups.bl.ex.com:ip4set:dialups \
          spam.bl.ex.com:ip4set:spammers \
          bl.ex.com:ip4set:dialups,spammers

       or:

        rbldnsd <u>options...</u> \
          dialups.bl.ex.com:ip4set:dialups \
          spam.bl.ex.com:ip4set:spammers \
          bl.ex.com:ip4set:dialups \
          bl.ex.com:ip4set:spammers

       (note  you  should  specify  combined  bl.ex.com  zone  <u>after</u> all its subzones in a command line, or else
       subzones will not be consulted at all).

       In the first form, there will be 3 independent data sets, and every record will  be  stored  2  times  in
       memory,  but  only one search in internal data structures will be needed to resolve queries for aggregate
       bl.ex.com.  In second form, there will be only 2 data sets, every record will be stored only  once  (both
       datasets will be reused), but 2 searches will be performed by <b>rbldnsd</b> to answer queries against aggregate
       zone  (but  difference  in  speed is almost unnoticeable).  Note that when aggregating several data files
       into one dataset, an exclusion entry in one file becomes exclusion entry in the whole dataset (which  may
       be  a  problem  when  aggregating  dialups,  where exclusions are common, with open relays/proxies, where
       exclusions are rare if at all used).

       Similar effect may be achieved by using <b>combined</b> dataset type, sometimes more easily.   <b>combined</b>  dataset
       results in every nested dataset to be used independantly, like in second form above.

       <b>combined</b>  dataset  requires  <b>rbldnsd</b>  to  be  the authoritative nameserver for the whole base zone.  Most
       important, one may specify SOA and NS records for the base zone <u>only</u>.  So, some DNSBLs which does not use
       a common subzone for the data, cannot use this dataset.  An example being DSBL.org DNSBL, where  each  of
       list.dsbl.org,  multihop.dsbl.org  and  unconfirmed.dsbl.org  zones  are separate, independant zones with
       different set of nameservers.  But for DSBL.org, where each dataset is really independant and  used  only
       once  (there's  no (sub)zone that is as a combinations of other zones), <b>combined</b> dataset isn't necessary.
       In contrast, SORBS.net zones, where several subzones used and main  zone  is  a  combination  of  several
       subzones, <b>combined</b> dataset is a way to go.

   <b>All</b> <b>authoritative</b> <b>nameservers</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>similarily</b>
       When you have several nameservers for your zone, set them all in a similar way.  Namely, if one is set up
       using  <b>combined</b>  dataset,  all  the  rest  should  be too, or else DNS meta-data will be broken.  This is
       because metadata (SOA and NS) records returned by nameservers using <b>combined</b> and other datasets will have
       different origin.  With combined dataset, <b>rbldnsd</b> return NS and SOA records for the base  zone,  not  for
       any   subzone   defined   inside   the   dataset.    Given  the  above  example  with  dialups.bl.ex.com,
       spammers.bl.ex.com and aggregate bl.ex.com zones, and two nameservers,  first  is  set  up  in  any  ways
       described  above (using individual datasets for every of the 3 zones), and second is set up for the whole
       bl.ex.com zone using <b>combined</b> dataset.  In  this  case,  for  queries  against  dialups.bl.ex.com,  first
       nameserver will return NS records like
         dialups.bl.ex.com. IN NS a.ns.ex.com.
       while second will always use base zone, and NS records will look like
         bl.ex.com. IN NS a.ns.ex.com.
       All  authoritative nameservers for a zone must have consistent metadata records.  The only way to achieve
       this is to use similar configuration (combined or not) on all nameservers.  Have this in mind when  using
       other software for a nameserver.

   <b>Generic</b> <b>dataset</b> <b>usage</b>
       <b>generic</b>  dataset  type  is  very  rudimentary.   It's purpose is to complement all the other type to form
       complete nameserver that may answer to A, TXT and MX queries.  This is useful mostly to define A  records
       for HTTP access (relays.bl.example.com A, www.bl.example.com A just in case), and maybe descriptive texts
       as a TXT record.

       Since  <b>rbldnsd</b> only searches <u>one</u>, most closely matching (sub)zone for every request, one cannot specify a
       single e.g.  <b>generic</b> dataset in form
         proxies      TXT list of open proxies
         www.proxies  A 127.0.0.8
         relays       TXT list of open relays
         www.relays   A 127.0.0.9
       for several (sub)zones, each of which are represented as a  zone  too  (either  in  command  line  or  as
       <b>combined</b>  dataset).   Instead,  several  <b>generic</b>  datasets  should  be  specified, separate one for every
       (sub)zone.  If the data for every subzone is the same, the same, single  dataset  may  be  used,  but  it
       should be specified for every zone it should apply to (see <b>combined</b> dataset usage example above).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Most  of  the  bugs  outlined in this section aren't really bugs, but present due to non-standartized and
       thus unknown expected behaviour of a nameserver that serves a DNSBL zone.  <b>rbldnsd</b> matches  BIND  runtime
       behaviour where appropriate, but not always.

       <b>rbldnsd</b>  lowercases  some  domain  names  (the  ones  that are lookup keys, e.g. in `generic' and `dnset'
       datasets) when loading, to speed up lookup operations.  This isn't a problem in most cases.

       There is no TCP mode.  If a resource record does not fit in UDP packet (512 bytes), it will  be  silently
       ignored.  For most usages, this isn't a problem, because there should be only a few RRs in an answer, and
       because  one  record  is usually sufficient to decide whenever a given entry is "listed" or not.  <b>rbldnsd</b>
       isn't a full-featured nameserver, after all.

       <b>rbldnsd</b> will not always return a list of nameserver records in the AUTHORITY section  of  every  positive
       answer:  NS records will be provided (if given) only if there's a room for them in single UDP packet.  If
       records does not fit, AUTHORITY section will be empty.

       <b>rbldnsd</b> does not allow AXFR operations.  For DNSBLs, AXFR is the stupidiest yet common thing to do -  use
       rsync  for  zone  transfers instead.  This isn't a bug in <b>rbldnsd</b> itself, but in common practice of using
       AXFR and the like to transfer huge zones in a format which isn't suitable for such a  task.   Perhaps  in
       the future, if there will be some real demand, I'll implement AXFR "server" support (so that <b>rbldnsd</b> will
       be able to act as master for BIND nameservers, but not as secondary), but the note remains: use rsync.

       <b>rbldnsd</b>  truncates  all TXT records to be at most 255 bytes.  DNS specs allows longer TXTs, but long TXTs
       is something that should be avoided as much as possible - TXT record is used as  SMTP  rejection  string.
       Note  that  DNS  UDP  packet  is  limited  to 512 bytes.  <b>rbldnsd</b> will log a warning when such truncation
       occurs.
