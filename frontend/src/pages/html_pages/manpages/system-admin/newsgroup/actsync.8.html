</pre><h4><b>IN</b> <b>A</b> <b>NUTSHELL</b></h4><pre>
       These programs permit keeping the list of newsgroups carried by your news server synchronized with an
       external source.

       For instance, you can decide to carry the same newsgroups as another news server or as listed in a file
       from an external FTP or web site, and then synchronize with the chosen source on a daily basis by running
       <b>actsyncd</b> in a cron job.

       If you only want a subset of newsgroups from that source, it can be parameterized in the <u>actsync.ign</u>
       configuration file in the <u>pathetc</u> directory.

       INN comes with a default configuration for fetching the list of newsgroups from "downloads.isc.org" (also
       known as "ftp.isc.org").  You can read about the policies used for maintaining that <u>active</u> file at
       &lt;https://downloads.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/README&gt;.  Just make sure <u>actsync.cfg</u> (the configuration
       file) and <u>actsync.ign</u> (the synchronization rules) suit your needs, and run:

           actsyncd &lt;pathetc&gt;/actsync.cfg

       You'll find more detailed examples of use below in this manual page.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>actsync</b> permits one to synchronize, compare, or merge two <u>active</u> files.  With this utility one may add,
       change, or remove newsgroups on the local news server to make it similar to the list of the newsgroups
       found on another system or file.  The synchronization need not be exact.  Local differences in newsgroup
       lists may be maintained and preserved.  Certain newsgroup errors may be detected and optionally
       corrected.

       There are several reasons to run <b>actsync</b> (or <b>actsyncd</b>) on a periodic basis.  Among the reasons are:

       • A control message to add, change or remove a newsgroup may fail to reach your site.

       • Your <u>control.ctl</u> file may be out of date or incomplete.

       • News articles for a new newsgroup may arrive ahead (sometimes days ahead) of the control message.

       • Control  messages may be forged, thus bypassing the restrictions found in <u>control.ctl</u> unless you set up
         PGP authentication (and even then, not all hierarchies use PGP authentication).

       • Your <u>active</u> file may have been trashed.

       If either <u>host</u> argument begins with "." or "/", it is assumed  to  be  the  name  of  a  file  containing
       information  in  the  <a href="../man5/active.5.html">active</a>(5)  format.   Newsgroup  information from a file may be treated as if it was
       obtained from a host.  In this manual page, the <u>host</u> arguments on the command line are called hosts, even
       though they may be file names.

       If a host argument does not begin with "." or "/", it is assumed to be a hostname  or  Internet  address.
       In  this  case,  <b>actsync</b> will attempt to use the NNTP protocol to obtain a copy of the specified system's
       <u>active</u> file.  If the host argument contains ":", the right side will be considered the port to connect to
       on the remote system.  If no port number is specified, <b>actsync</b> will connect to port "119".

       Regardless how the <u>active</u> file information is obtained, the actions of <b>actsync</b> remain the same.

       The first host specified is taken to be the local host, the one where any changes  would  be  made.   The
       second host specified is the remote host that is being synchronized with.  If only one host is specified,
       it  is assumed to be the remote host to synchronize with, and the local host is assumed to be the default
       local NNTP server as specified by the NNTPSERVER environment variable or by the  <u>server</u>  value  found  in
       <u>inn.conf</u>.

       If  either  host  is  specified  as  "-",  the  default  server will be used for that host, determined as
       described above.

       The newsgroup synchronization, by default, involves all newsgroups found on both  hosts.   One  may  also
       synchronize  a  subset of newsgroups by directing <b>actsync</b> to ignore certain newsgroups from both systems.
       Only newsgroups with valid names will be synchronized.  To be valid, a newsgroup name must  consist  only
       of  alphanumeric  characters, ".", "+", "-", and "_".  One may not have two "." characters in a row.  The
       first character must be alphanumeric, as must any character following ".".  The name may not end in a "."
       character.

       The <b>actsyncd</b> daemon provides a convenient interface to configure and run  <b>actsync</b>.   If  a  host  is  not
       initially reachable, the daemon will retry up to 9 additional times, waiting 6 minutes before each retry.
       This  daemon runs in the foreground, sending output to standard output and standard error.  <b>actsyncd</b> runs
       the <a href="../man1/getlist.1.html">getlist</a>(1) utility to obtain a copy of a remote system's <u>active</u> file via its NNTP server, or runs  an
       FTP or web client program (<b>wget</b> or <b>ncftpget</b> if installed and found at configure time, or the <a href="../man1/simpleftp.1.html">simpleftp</a>(1)
       program   shipped  with  INN)  to  fetch  a  list  of  newsgroups  from  an  external  archive  (such  as
       &lt;https://downloads.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/active&gt;;  see  more  about  this  below).   It   then   uses
       <a href="../man8/mod-active.8.html">mod-active</a>(8) to update the <u>active</u> file if there are commands for <b>ctlinnd</b> in its output.

       The  configuration  filename  for  the daemon is given as a command line argument, usually <u>actsync.cfg</u> in
       <u>pathetc</u>.  This file can contain the following options:

           host=&lt;host&gt;
           path=&lt;path-to-active&gt;
           protocol=&lt;protocol&gt;
           flags=&lt;actsync-options&gt;
           ignore_file=&lt;ignore-file&gt;

       The "host=", "flags=", and "ignore_file=" lines are mandatory.  Each keyword must start at the  beginning
       of  the  line,  and there may be no whitespace before the "=" character.  Blank lines are ignored, as are
       comment lines that start with "#".  Any other lines may produce undefined results.

       The &lt;host&gt; setting refers to the second (remote) <u>host</u> parameter to <b>actsync</b>.  If &lt;path-to-active&gt;  is  not
       provided,  &lt;protocol&gt;  is  considered  to  be "nntp", and &lt;host&gt; is accessed as a remote NNTP server.  If
       &lt;path-to-active&gt; is provided, &lt;host&gt; is accessed as an FTP or  web  server  depending  on  the  value  of
       &lt;protocol&gt;  ("ftp", "http" or "https", defaulting to "ftp" when unset), retrieving the <u>active</u> file at the
       &lt;path-to-active&gt; absolute path.  If the filename ends in ".bz2", ".gz" or ".Z", it will be  automatically
       uncompressed  after  retrieval.   &lt;actsync-options&gt;  contains  any  other  flags that you wish to pass to
       <b>actsync</b>. &lt;ignore-file&gt; names the ignore file used by <b>actsync</b> (the <b>-i</b> option).

       Note that one should not include <b>-i</b> or <b>-o</b> options in the "flags=" line; they are automatically taken care
       of by <b>actsyncd</b>.

       One may produce a trial <b>actsyncd</b> run without changing anything on the server by supplying the <u>debug-level</u>
       argument:

           actsyncd &lt;pathetc&gt;/actsync.cfg 2

       The <u>debug-level</u> causes <b>actsyncd</b> to run <b>actsync</b> with a <b>-v</b> <u>debug-level</u> flag (overriding any <b>-v</b> flag on  the
       "flags="  line), not make any changes to the <u>active</u> file, write a new <u>active</u> file to standard output, and
       write debug messages to standard error.  Note that using <u>debug-level</u> is only supported when synchronizing
       with another news server, not with FTP or HTTP(S).

       If the <u>debug-format</u> argument is also given to <b>actsyncd</b>, the data written to standard output  will  be  in
       "-o <u>debug-format</u>" instead of in "-o a1" format.

       INN  comes  with  default values of "downloads.isc.org" for &lt;host&gt; and "/pub/usenet/CONFIG/active.gz" for
       &lt;path-to-active&gt;:

           host=downloads.isc.org
           path=/pub/usenet/CONFIG/active.gz
           protocol=https
           flags=-v 0 -p 80
           ignore_file=actsync.ign

       You   can   read   about    the    policies    used    for    maintaining    that    <u>active</u>    file    at
       &lt;https://downloads.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/README&gt;.   Consider  synchronizing from this file on a daily
       basis by using a cron job.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>actsync</b> takes the following options.

       In all of the following options, the <u>hostid</u> parameter takes one of the following values:

           0    neither server
           1    local default server
           2    remote server
           12   both servers
           21   both servers

       In other words, "1" refers to the local host (the first <u>host</u> argument on the <b>actsync</b>  command  line)  and
       "2" refers to the remote host (the second <u>host</u> argument, or the only one if only one is given).

       <b>-A</b>  <b>actsync</b>  tries  to  authenticate using the username and password information in <a href="../man5/passwd.nntp.5.html">passwd.nntp</a>(5) before
           issuing the LIST command.

       <b>-b</b> <u>hostid</u>
           This   flag   causes   <b>actsync</b>   to   ignore   for   synchronization   purposes    newsgroups    with
           "bork.bork.bork"-style  names  (newsgroups  whose last 3 components are identical).  For example, the
           following newsgroups have bork-style names:

               alt.helms.dork.dork.dork
               alt.auto.accident.sue.sue.sue
               alt.election.vote.vote.vote

           The default is "-b 0"; no newsgroups are ignored because of bork-style names.

       <b>-d</b> <u>hostid</u>
           This flag causes <b>actsync</b> to ignore newsgroups that have all numeric path  components.   For  example,
           the following newsgroups have numeric path components:

               alt.prime.chongo.23209
               391581.times.2.to_the.216193.power.-1
               99.bottles.of.treacle.on.the.wall
               linfield.class.envio_bio.101.d

           The  newsgroups  directory of a newsgroup with a all numeric component could conflict with an article
           from another group if stored using the tradspool storage method; see <a href="../man5/storage.conf.5.html">storage.conf</a>(5).   For  example,
           the  directory for the first newsgroup listed above is the same path as article number 23209 from the
           newsgroup:

               alt.prime.chongo

           The default is "-d 0"; all numeric newsgroups from both hosts will be processed.

       <b>-g</b> <u>max</u>
           Ignore any newsgroup with more than <u>max</u> levels.  For example, "-g 6" would ignore:

               alt.feinstien.votes.to.trash.freedom.of.speech
               alt.senator.exon.enemy.of.the.internet
               alt.crypto.export.laws.dumb.dumb.dumb

           but would not ignore:

               alt.feinstien.acts.like.a.republican
               alt.exon.amendment
               alt.crypto.export.laws

           If <u>max</u> is "0", then the max level feature is disabled.

           By default, the max level feature is disabled.

       <b>-i</b> <u>ignore-file</u>
           The <u>ignore-file</u>, usually <u>actsync.ign</u> in <u>pathetc</u>, allows one to have a fine  degree  of  control  over
           which  newsgroups  are  ignored.   It contains a set of rules that specifies which newsgroups will be
           checked and which will be ignored.

           By default, these rules apply to both hosts.  This can be modified by using the <b>-I</b> flag.

           Blank lines and text after a "#" are considered comments and are ignored.

           Rule lines consist of tokens separated by whitespace.  Rule lines may be one of two forms:

               c &lt;newsgroup&gt; [&lt;type&gt; ...]
               i &lt;newsgroup&gt; [&lt;type&gt; ...]

           If the rule begins with a "c", the rule requests certain newsgroups  to  be  checked.   If  the  rule
           begins with an "i", the rule requests certain newsgroups to be ignored.  The &lt;newsgroup&gt; field may be
           a specific newsgroup, or a <u>uwildmat</u> pattern.

           If  one  or  more  &lt;type&gt;s are specified, then the rule applies to the newsgroup only if it is of the
           specified type.  Types refer to the 4th field of the <u>active</u> file; that is, a type may be one of:

               y
               n
               m
               j
               x
               =group.name

           Unlike <u>active</u> files, the "group.name" in an alias type may be a newsgroup name or a <u>uwildmat</u> pattern.
           Also, "=" is equivalent to "=*".

           On each rule line, no pattern type may be repeated.  For example, one may not have more than one type
           that begins with "=", per line.  However, one may achieve an effect equivalent to using multiple  "="
           types by using multiple rule lines affecting the same newsgroup.

           By  default,  all newsgroups are candidates to be checked.  If no <u>ignore-file</u> is specified, or if the
           ignore file contains no rule lines, all newsgroups will be checked.  If an ignore file is used,  each
           newsgroup in turn is checked against the ignore file.  If multiple lines match a given newsgroup, the
           last line in the ignore file is used.

           For example, consider the following ignore file lines:

               i *.general
               c *.general m
               i nsa.general

           The  newsgroups  ba.general  and  mod.general  would  be synchronized if moderated and ignored if not
           moderated.  The newsgroup  nsa.general  would  be  ignored  regardless  of  moderation  status.   All
           newsgroups not matching *.general would be synchronized by default.

       <b>-I</b> <u>hostid</u>
           This  flag  restricts  which  hosts  are  affected  by  the  ignore file.  This flag may be useful in
           conjunction with the <b>-m</b> flag.  For example:

               actsync -i actsync.ign -I 2 -m host1 host2

           will keep all newsgroups currently on <u>host1</u>.  It will also only compare <u>host1</u> groups with non-ignored
           newsgroups from <u>host2</u>.

           The default is "-I 12"; newsgroups from both hosts are ignored per the file specified with <b>-i</b>.

       <b>-k</b>  By default, any newsgroup on the local host that has an invalid name will be considered for  removal.
           This  causes  <b>actsync</b>  simply  ignore  such newsgroups.  This flag, used in combination with <b>-m</b>, will
           prevent any newsgroup from being scheduled for removal.

       <b>-l</b> <u>hostid</u>
           This flag causes problem newsgroups of type "=" to be considered as errors.  Newsgroups of  type  "="
           are  newsgroups  <u>active</u>  entries that have a fourth field that begins with "="; i.e., newsgroups that
           are aliased to other newsgroups.  A problem newsgroup is one for which one of the following is true:

           • Aliased to itself.

           • In an alias chain that loops around to itself.

           • In an alias chain longer than 16 groups.

           • Aliased to a non-existent newsgroup.

           • Aliased to a newsgroup that has an error of some kind.

           However, a newsgroup that is equivalent to an ignored newsgroup is not a problem.

           The default is "-l 12": problem newsgroups from both hosts are marked as errors.

       <b>-m</b>  Merge newsgroups instead of sync.  By default, if a newsgroup exists on the local host  but  not  the
           remote,  it  will be scheduled to be removed.  This flag disables this process, permitting newsgroups
           unique to the local host to be kept.

       <b>-n</b> <u>name</u>
           Depending on <b>-o</b>, the <a href="../man8/ctlinnd.8.html">ctlinnd</a>(8) command may be used to create newsgroups as necessary.  When this  is
           done, the default creator name used is "actsync".  This flag changes the creator name to <u>name</u>.

       <b>-o</b> <u>format</u>
           Determine the output or action format of this utility.  <u>format</u> may be one of:

           a   Output in <a href="../man5/active.5.html">active</a>(5) format.

           a1  Output in <a href="../man5/active.5.html">active</a>(5) format and output non-error ignored groups from the local host.

           ak  Output  in <a href="../man5/active.5.html">active</a>(5) format, but use the high and low (2nd and 3rd active fields) values from the
               remote host for any newsgroup being created.

           aK  Output in <a href="../man5/active.5.html">active</a>(5) format, but use the high and low (2nd and 3rd active fields) values from  the
               remote host for all newsgroups found on that host.

           a1k Output  in <a href="../man5/active.5.html">active</a>(5) format, but use the high and low (2nd and 3rd active fields) values from the
               remote host for any newsgroup being created and output non-error ignored groups  from  the  local
               host.

           a1K Output  in <a href="../man5/active.5.html">active</a>(5) format, but use the high and low (2nd and 3rd active fields) values from the
               remote host for all newsgroups found on that host and output non-error ignored  groups  from  the
               local host.

           ak1 Same as "a1k".

           aK1 Same as "a1K".

           c   Output as commands to <b>ctlinnd</b>.

           x   No output.  Instead, directly run <b>ctlinnd</b> commands.

           xi  No output.  Instead, directly run <b>ctlinnd</b> commands in an interactive mode.

           The  "a",  "a1",  "ak",  "aK",  "a1k",  "a1K", "ak1", and "aK1" style formats allow one to format new
           <u>active</u> file instead of producing <b>ctlinnd</b> commands.  They use high and low values of "0000000000"  and
           "0000000001"  respectively  for newsgroups that are created unless otherwise specified.  The "ak" and
           "aK" variants change the high and low values (2nd and 3rd <u>active</u>  fields).   In  the  case  of  "ak",
           newsgroups  created  take  their  high and low values from the remote host.  In the case of "aK", all
           newsgroups found on the remote host take their high and low values from it.

           The "c" format produces <b>ctlinnd</b> commands.  No actions are taken because <b>actsync</b> simply prints <b>ctlinnd</b>
           commands on standard output.  This output format is useful to let you see how the local host will  be
           affected by the sync (or merge) with the remote host.

           The sync (or merge) may be accomplished directly by use of the "x" or "xi" format.  With this format,
           <b>actsync</b>  uses the <a href="../man2/execl.2.html">execl</a>(2) system call to directly execute <b>ctlinnd</b> commands.  The output of such exec
           calls may be seen if the verbosity level is at least "2".

           The <b>actsync</b> utility will pause for 4 seconds before each command is executed if "-o x"  is  selected.
           See the <b>-z</b> flag below for discussion of this delay and how to customize it.

           The "xi" format interactively prompts on standard output and reads directives on standard input.  One
           may pick and choose changes using this format.

           Care  should  be  taken  when producing <a href="../man5/active.5.html">active</a>(5) formatted output.  One should check to be sure that
           <b>actsync</b> exited with a zero status prior to using such output.  Also  one  should  realize  that  such
           output will not contain lines ignored due to <b>-i</b> even if "-p 100" is used.

           By default, "-o c" is assumed.

       <b>-p</b> <u>min-unchanged</u>
           By  default,  the  <b>actsync</b>  utility has safeguards against performing massive changes.  If fewer than
           <u>min-unchanged</u> percent of the non-ignored lines from the  local  host  remain  unchanged,  no  actions
           (output,  execution,  etc.)  are  performed  and <b>actsync</b> exits with a non-zero exit status.  The <u>min-</u>
           <u>unchanged</u> value may be a floating point value such as "66.667".

           A change is a local newsgroup line that was removed,  added,  changed,  or  found  to  be  in  error.
           Changing the 2nd or 3rd <u>active</u> fields via "-o ak" or "-o aK" are not considered changes by <b>-p</b>.

           To  force  <b>actsync</b> to accept any amount of change, use the "-p 0" option.  To force <b>actsync</b> to reject
           any changes, use the "-p 100" option.

           Care should be taken when producing <a href="../man5/active.5.html">active</a>(5) formatted output.  One should check  to  be  sure  that
           <b>actsync</b>  exited  with  a  zero  status prior to using such output.  Also one should realize that such
           output will not contain lines ignored due to <b>-i</b> even if "-p 100" is used.

           By default, 96% of the lines not ignored in the first <u>host</u> argument on the <b>actsync</b> command line  must
           be unchanged.  That is, by default, "-p 96" is assumed.

       <b>-q</b> <u>hostid</u>
           By  default,  all  newsgroup errors are reported on standard error.  This flag quiets errors from the
           specified <u>hostid</u>.

       <b>-s</b> <u>size</u>
           If <u>size</u> is greater than 0, then ignore newsgroups with names longer than <u>size</u> and  ignore  newsgroups
           aliased  (by  following  "=" chains) to names longer than <u>size</u>.  Length checking is performed on both
           the local and remote hosts.

           By default, <u>size</u> is "0" and thus no length checking is performed.

       <b>-t</b> <u>hostid</u>
           Ignore improper newsgroups consisting of only  a  top  component  from  the  specified  <u>hostid</u>.   The
           following newsgroups are considered proper newsgroups despite top only names and therefore are exempt
           from this flag:

               control
               general
               junk
               test
               to

           For  example,  the  following  newsgroup  names  are  improper  because they only contain a top level
           component:

               dole_for_pres
               dos
               microsoft
               windows95

           The default is "-t 2"; that is, all improper top-level-only  newsgroups  from  the  remote  host  are
           ignored.

       <b>-T</b>  This  flag  causes  newsgroups  on  the  remote  host  in  new hierarchies to be ignored.  Normally a
           newsgroup which only exists on the remote host, chongo.was.here for example, is created on the  local
           host.   However,  if  this flag is given and the local host does not have any other newsgroups in the
           same hierarchy (chongo.* in this case), the newsgroup in question will be ignored  and  will  not  be
           created on the local host.

       <b>-v</b> <u>verbosity</u>
           By default, <b>actsync</b> is not verbose.  This flag controls the verbosity level as follows:

           0 No debug or status reports (default).

           1 Print summary, but only if work was needed or done.

           2 Print actions, exec output, and summary, but only if work was needed or done.

           3 Print actions, exec output, and summary.

           4 Full debug output.

       <b>-w</b> <u>seconds</u>
           If  "-o  x" or "-o xi" is selected, <b>ctlinnd</b> will wait <u>seconds</u> seconds before timing out.  The default
           value is "-w 30".

       <b>-z</b> <u>seconds</u>
           If "-o x" is selected, <b>actsync</b> will pause for <u>seconds</u> seconds before each command is executed.   This
           helps  prevent  <b>innd</b> from being busied-out if a large number of <b>ctlinnd</b> commands are needed.  One can
           entirely disable this sleeping by using "-z 0".

           By default, <b>actsync</b> will pause for "4" seconds before each command is executed if "-o x" is selected.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Determine the difference (but don't change anything) between your newsgroup set and the  one  of  another
       news server:

           actsync news.server.com

       Same as above, with full debug and progress reports:

           actsync -v 4 news.server.com

       Force a site to have the same newsgroups as some other site:

           actsync -o x master

       This may be useful to sync a slave site to its master, or to sync internal site to a gateway.

       Compare  your site with news.server.com, disregarding local groups and certain local differences with it.
       Produce a report if any differences were encountered:

           actsync -v 2 -i actsync.ign news.server.com

       where <u>actsync.ign</u> contains:

           # Don't compare to.* groups as they will differ.
           #
           i       to.*

           # These are our local groups that nobody else
           # (should) carry.  So ignore them for the sake
           # of the compare.
           #
           i       nsa.*

           # These groups are local favorites, so keep them
           # even if news.server.com does not carry them.
           #
           i       ca.dump.bob.dorman
           i       ca.keep.bob.dorman
           i       alt.tv.dinosaurs.barney.die.die.die
           i       alt.tv.dinosaurs.barney.love.love.love
           i       alt.sounds.*    =alt.binaries.sounds.*

       To interactively sync against news.server.com, using the same ignore file:

           actsync -o xi -v 2 -i actsync.ign news.server.com

       Based on newsgroups that you decided to keep, one could make changes to the <u>actsync.ign</u> file:

           # Don't compare to.* groups as they will differ.
           #
           i       to.*

           # These are our local groups that nobody else
           # (should) carry.  So ignore them for the sake
           # of the compare.
           #
           i       nsa.*

           # These groups are local favorites, so keep them
           # even if news.server.com does not carry them.
           #
           i       ca.dump.bob.dorman
           i       alt.tv.dinosaurs.barney.die.die.die
           i       alt.sounds.*    =alt.binaries.sounds.*

           # Don't sync test groups, except for ones that are
           # moderated or that are under the gnu hierarchy.
           #
           i       *.test
           c       *.test m        # check moderated test groups
           c       gnu.*.test
           c       gnu.test        # just in case it ever exists

       Automatic processing may be set up by using the following <u>actsync.cfg</u> file:

           # Host to sync off of (host2).
           host=news.server.com

           # Location of the ignore file.
           ignore_file=&lt;pathetc in inn.conf&gt;/actsync.ign

           # <a href="../man8/actsync.8.html">actsync</a>(8) flags
           #
           # Automatic execs, report if something was done,
           # otherwise don't say anything, don't report
           # news.server.com active file problems, just ignore
           # the affected entries.
           flags=-o x -v 2 -q 2

       and then by running <b>actsyncd</b> with the path to the config file:

           actsyncd &lt;pathetc&gt;/actsync.cfg

       The command

           actsyncd &lt;pathetc&gt;/actsync.cfg 4 &gt;cmd.log 2&gt;dbg.log

       will operate in debug mode, not change the <u>active</u> file, write <b>ctlinnd</b>  style  commands  to  <u>cmd.log</u>,  and
       write  debug  statements  to  <u>dbg.log</u>.  (Note that using <u>debug-level</u> is only supported when synchronizing
       with another news server, not with FTP or HTTP(S).)

       To check only the major hierarchies against news.server.com, use the following <u>actsync.ign</u> file:

           # By default, ignore everything.
           #
           i       *

           # Check the major groups.
           #
           c       alt.*
           c       comp.*
           c       gnu.*
           c       humanities.*
           c       misc.*
           c       news.*
           c       rec.*
           c       sci.*
           c       soc.*
           c       talk.*

       and the command:

           actsync -i actsync.ign news.server.com

       To determine the differences between your old <u>active</u> and your current default server:

           actsync &lt;pathetc&gt;/active.old -

       To report but not fix any newsgroup problems with the current <u>active</u> file:

           actsync - -

       To detect any newsgroup errors on your local server,  and  to  remove  any  *.bork.bork.bork-style  silly
       newsgroup names:

           actsync -b 2 - -

       The <u>active</u> file produced by:

           actsync &lt;flags&gt; -o x erehwon.honey.edu

       is effectively the same as the <u>active</u> file produced by:

           cd &lt;pathdb&gt;
           ctlinnd pause 'running actsync'
           rm -f active.new
           actsync &lt;flags&gt; -o a1 erehwon.honey.edu &gt; active.new
           rm -f active.old
           ln active active.old
           mv active.new active
           ctlinnd reload active 'running actsync'
           ctlinnd go 'running actsync'

       It  should be noted that the final method above, pausing the server and simply replacing the <u>active</u> file,
       may be faster if you are making lots of changes.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>pathbin</u>/actsync
           The C program itself used to synchronize, compare, or merge two <u>active</u> files.

       <u>pathbin</u>/actsyncd
           The Shell daemon which provides a convenient interface to configure and run <b>actsync</b>.

       <u>pathetc</u>/actsync.cfg
           The configuration file which specifies the settings to use.

       <u>pathetc</u>/actsync.ign
           The ignore file which contains a set of synchronization rules that specifies which newsgroups will be
           checked and which will be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>CAUTION</b></h4><pre>
       Careless use of this tool may result in the unintended addition, change, or removal of  newsgroups.   You
       should avoid using the "x" output format until you are sure it will do what you want.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If a newsgroup appears multiple times, <b>actsync</b> will treat all copies as errors.  However, if the group is
       marked for removal, only one rmgroup will be issued.
