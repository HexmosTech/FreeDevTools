</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       eventstat - a tool to measure system events.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>eventstat</b> [options] <u>[delay</u> [count]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       eventstat  is  a  program  that dumps the current active system events that are added to the kernel timer
       list.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       eventstat options are as follow:

       <b>-b</b>     just report events, PID and process name. By default the short task  name  from  the  kernel  comm
              field will be displayed, however the -s and -l options will report more process name information.

       <b>-c</b>     report cumulative events rather than events per sample period.

       <b>-C</b>     report the sample event count in the CSV output rather than the default events per second rate.

       <b>-d</b>     strip full directory path off the process name in the CSV output.

       <b>-h</b>     show help.

       <b>-i</b>     show timer ID information.

       <b>-k</b>     report just kernel threads.

       <b>-l</b>     report long process name from /proc/pid/cmdline. This reports the process name and all the command
              line arguments.

       <b>-n</b> <b>event_count</b>
              only display the first event_count number of top events.

       <b>-q</b>     run quietly, only really makes sense with -r option.

       <b>-r</b> <b>csv_file</b>
              output gathered data in a comma separated values file. This can be then imported and graphed using
              your favourite open source spread sheet.

       <b>-s</b>     report short process name from /proc/pid/cmdline. This reports just the process name.

       <b>-S</b>     report  the  minimum,  maximum,  average  and  population standard deviation at the end of the CSV
              output.

       <b>-t</b> <b>threshold</b>
              ignore samples where the event delta per second less than the given threshold.

       <b>-T</b>     enable 'top' mode, refresh display on each update.

       <b>-u</b>     report just user space processes.

       <b>-w</b>     add timestamp (the "whence" info) to the output.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Dump events every second until stopped.
               sudo eventstat

       Dump the top 20 events every 60 seconds until stopped.
               sudo eventstat -n 20 60

       Dump events every 10 seconds just 5 times.
               sudo eventstat 10 5

       Quietly dump events every 10 seconds just 5 times into a CSV file with short process name.
               sudo eventstat 10 5 -q -s -r results.csv

</pre><h4><b>CSV</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The -r option generates a comma separated file report that can be imported into  spreadsheets  or  parsed
       using  text  processing tools.  Column 1 of the data is the label for each row, columns 2 onwards contain
       the data for each task that generated a wakeup event.

       The first row lists the task name of the thread or process.  Task  names  in  [  ]  brackets  are  kernel
       threads,  other tasks are the names of user space processes.  By default these names are derived from the
       task names from kernel trace  events  but  the  -s  -l  options  fetch  more  complete  task  names  from
       /proc/pid/cmdline instead.

       The second and third rows list the names of the internal Linux kernel timer init function.

       The fourth row lists the total number of wakeup events for each task during the entire run of eventstat.

       The subsequent rows list the average number of wakeups per second measured during the sample interval for
       each  task in column two onwards. The first column indicates the sample time (in seconds) since the start
       of the measuring.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Version 4.0 of eventstat gathers event timer data from the kernel trace event timers  and  hence  is  not
       compatible  with  previous  versions of eventstat. The move to using kernel trace events was necessary as
       the Linux 4.12 kernel dropped support for the /proc/timer_stats interface.
