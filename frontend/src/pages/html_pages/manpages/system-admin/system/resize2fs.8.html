       resize2fs - ext2/ext3/ext4 file system resizer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>resize2fs</b> [ <b>-fFpPMbs</b> ] [ <b>-d</b> <u>debug-flags</u> ] [ <b>-S</b> <u>RAID-stride</u> ] [ <b>-z</b> <u>undo_file</u> ] <u>device</u> [ <u>size</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>resize2fs</b> program will resize ext2, ext3, or ext4 file systems.  It can be used to enlarge or shrink
       an unmounted file system located on <u>device</u>.  If the file system is mounted, it can be used to expand  the
       size  of  the  mounted  file  system,  assuming the kernel and the file system supports on-line resizing.
       (Modern Linux 2.6 kernels will support on-line resize for file systems mounted using ext3 and ext4;  ext3
       file systems will require the use of file systems with the resize_inode feature enabled.)

       The  <u>size</u>  parameter specifies the requested new size of the file system.  If no units are specified, the
       units of the <u>size</u> parameter shall be the file system blocksize of the file system.  Optionally, the  <u>size</u>
       parameter  may  be  suffixed by one of the following units designators: 'K', 'M', 'G', 'T' (either upper-
       case or lower-case) or 's' for power-of-two  kilobytes,  megabytes,  gigabytes,  terabytes  or  512  byte
       sectors respectively. The <u>size</u> of the file system may never be larger than the size of the partition.  If
       <u>size</u> parameter is not specified, it will default to the size of the partition.

       The  <b>resize2fs</b> program does not manipulate the size of partitions.  If you wish to enlarge a file system,
       you must make sure you can expand the size of the underlying partition first.  This  can  be  done  using
       <b><a href="../man8/fdisk.8.html">fdisk</a></b>(8)  by  deleting the partition and recreating it with a larger size or using <b><a href="../man8/lvextend.8.html">lvextend</a></b>(8), if you're
       using the logical volume manager <b><a href="../man8/lvm.8.html">lvm</a></b>(8).  When recreating the partition, make sure you create it with the
       same starting disk cylinder as before!  Otherwise, the resize operation will certainly not work, and  you
       may  lose  your entire file system.  After running <b><a href="../man8/fdisk.8.html">fdisk</a></b>(8), run resize2fs to resize the ext2 file system
       to use all of the space in the newly enlarged partition.

       If you wish to shrink an ext2 partition, first use <b>resize2fs</b> to shrink the size of file system.  Then you
       may use <b><a href="../man8/fdisk.8.html">fdisk</a></b>(8) to shrink the size of the partition.  When shrinking the size  of  the  partition,  make
       sure you do not make it smaller than the new size of the ext2 file system!

       The <b>-b</b> and <b>-s</b> options enable and disable the 64bit feature, respectively.  The resize2fs program will, of
       course, take care of resizing the block group descriptors and moving other data blocks out of the way, as
       needed.  It is not possible to resize the file system concurrent with changing the 64bit status.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b>     Turns  on  the 64bit feature, resizes the group descriptors as necessary, and moves other metadata
              out of the way.

       <b>-d</b> <u>debug-flags</u>
              Turns on various resize2fs debugging features, if they have been compiled into the binary.  <u>debug-</u>
              <u>flags</u> should be computed by adding the numbers of the desired features from the following list:
                   2    - Debug block relocations
                   4    - Debug inode relocations
                   8    - Debug moving the inode table
                   16   - Print timing information
                   32   - Debug minimum file system size (-M) calculation

       <b>-f</b>     Forces resize2fs to proceed with the file system resize operation, overriding some  safety  checks
              which resize2fs normally enforces.

       <b>-F</b>     Flush  the  file  system  device's  buffer  caches before beginning.  Only really useful for doing
              <b>resize2fs</b> time trials.

       <b>-M</b>     Shrink the file system to minimize its size as much as possible, given the  files  stored  in  the
              file system.

       <b>-p</b>     Print  out  percentage  completion  bars  for each <b>resize2fs</b> phase during an offline (non-trivial)
              resize operation, so that the user can keep track of what the program is doing.   (For  very  fast
              resize operations, no progress bars may be displayed.)

       <b>-P</b>     Print  an  estimate  of  the number of file system blocks in the file system if it is shrunk using
              <b>resize2fs</b>'s <b>-M</b> option and then exit.

       <b>-s</b>     Turns off the 64bit feature and frees blocks that are no longer in use.

       <b>-S</b> <u>RAID-stride</u>
              The <b>resize2fs</b> program will heuristically determine the RAID stride that  was  specified  when  the
              file  system was created.  This option allows the user to explicitly specify a RAID stride setting
              to be used by resize2fs instead.

       <b>-z</b> <u>undo_file</u>
              Before overwriting a file system block, write the old contents of the block to an undo file.  This
              undo file can be used with <a href="../man8/e2undo.8.html">e2undo</a>(8) to restore  the  old  contents  of  the  file  system  should
              something  go  wrong.  If the empty string is passed as the undo_file argument, the undo file will
              be  written  to  a  file  named  resize2fs-<u>device</u>.e2undo  in  the  directory  specified  via   the
              <u>E2FSPROGS_UNDO_DIR</u> environment variable.

              WARNING: The undo file cannot be used to recover from a power or system crash.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  minimum  size  of  the  file  system as estimated by resize2fs may be incorrect, especially for file
       systems with 1k and 2k blocksizes.
