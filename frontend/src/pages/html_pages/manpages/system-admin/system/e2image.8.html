       e2image - Save critical ext2/ext3/ext4 file system metadata to a file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>e2image</b>  [<b>-r</b>|<b>-Q</b>  [<b>-af</b>]] [ <b>-b</b> <u>superblock</u> ] [ <b>-B</b> <u>blocksize</u> ] [ <b>-cnps</b> ] [ <b>-o</b> <u>src_offset</u> ] [ <b>-O</b> <u>dest_offset</u> ]
       <u>device</u> <u>image-file</u>
       <b>e2image</b> <b>-I</b> <u>device</u> <u>image-file</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>e2image</b> program will save critical ext2, ext3, or ext4 file system metadata located on  <u>device</u>  to  a
       file  specified  by  <u>image-file</u>.  The image file may be examined by <b>dumpe2fs</b> and <b>debugfs</b>, by using the <b>-i</b>
       option to those programs.  This can assist  an  expert  in  recovering  catastrophically  corrupted  file
       systems.

       It  is  a  very  good  idea to create image files for all file systems on a system and save the partition
       layout (which can be generated using the <b>fdisk</b> <b>-l</b> command) at regular intervals â€” at  boot  time,  and/or
       every  week  or so.  The image file should be stored on some file system other than the file system whose
       data it contains, to ensure that this data is accessible in the case where the file system has been badly
       damaged.

       To save disk space, <b>e2image</b> creates the image file as a sparse file, or in QCOW2 format.  Hence,  if  the
       sparse  image file needs to be copied to another location, it should either be compressed first or copied
       using the <b>--sparse=always</b> option to the GNU version of <b><a href="../man1/cp.1.html">cp</a></b>(1).  This does not apply to  the  QCOW2  image,
       which is not sparse.

       The  size of an ext2 image file depends primarily on the size of the file systems and how many inodes are
       in use.  For a typical 10 Gigabyte file system, with 200,000 inodes in use out of 1.2 million inodes, the
       image file will be approximately 35 Megabytes; a 4 Gigabyte file system with 15,000 inodes in use out  of
       550,000  inodes  will  result  in a 3 Megabyte image file.  Image files tend to be quite compressible; an
       image file taking up 32 Megabytes of space on disk will generally compress down to 3 or 4 Megabytes.

       If <u>image-file</u> is <b>-</b>, then the output of <b>e2image</b> will be sent to standard output, so that the output can be
       piped to another program, such as <b><a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a></b>(1).  (Note that this is currently only supported when  creating  a
       raw  image  file  using  the <b>-r</b> option, since the process of creating a normal image file, or QCOW2 image
       currently requires random access to the file, which cannot be done using a pipe.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>     Include file data in the image file.  Normally <b>e2image</b> only includes fs metadata, not regular file
              data.  This option will produce an image that is suitable to use to clone the  entire  FS  or  for
              backup  purposes.   Note  that this option only works with the raw (<u>-r</u>) or QCOW2 (<u>-Q</u>) formats.  In
              conjunction with the <b>-r</b> option it is possible to clone all and only the used blocks  of  one  file
              system to another device/image file.

       <b>-b</b> <u>superblock</u>
              Get  image  from  partition with broken primary superblock by using the superblock located at file
              system  block  number  <u>superblock</u>.   The  partition  is  copied  as-is  including  broken  primary
              superblock.

       <b>-B</b> <u>blocksize</u>
              Set  the  file  system  blocksize  in  bytes.  Normally, <b>e2image</b> will search for the superblock at
              various different block sizes in an attempt to find the appropriate blocksize. This search can  be
              fooled  in  some  cases.   This  option  forces  e2fsck to only try locating the superblock with a
              particular blocksize. If the superblock is not found, e2image will terminate with a fatal error.

       <b>-c</b>     Compare each block to be copied from the source <u>device</u> to the corresponding block  in  the  target
              <u>image-file</u>.   If both are already the same, the write will be skipped.  This is useful if the file
              system is being cloned to a flash-based storage device (where reads are very fast and where it  is
              desirable to avoid unnecessary writes to reduce write wear on the device).

       <b>-f</b>     Override the read-only requirement for the source file system when saving the image file using the
              <b>-r</b>  and  <b>-Q</b>  options.   Normally, if the source file system is in use, the resulting image file is
              very likely not going to be useful. In some cases where the source file system is in constant  use
              this may be better than no image at all.

       <b>-I</b>     install  the  metadata stored in the image file back to the device.  It can be used to restore the
              file system metadata back to the device in emergency situations.

       <b>WARNING!!!!</b>  The <b>-I</b> option should only be used as a desperation  measure  when  other  alternatives  have
       failed.  If the file system has changed since the image file was created, data <b>will</b> be lost.  In general,
       you  should  make  another  full  image  backup  of  the file system first, in case you wish to try other
       recovery strategies afterward.

       <b>-n</b>     Cause all image writes to be skipped, and instead only print the block  numbers  that  would  have
              been written.

       <b>-o</b> <u>src_offset</u>
              Specify  offset of the image to be read from the start of the source <u>device</u> in bytes.  See <b>OFFSETS</b>
              for more details.

       <b>-O</b> <u>tgt_offset</u>
              Specify offset of the image to be written from the start of the target <u>image-file</u> in  bytes.   See
              <b>OFFSETS</b> for more details.

       <b>-p</b>     Show progress of image-file creation.

       <b>-Q</b>     Create  a  QCOW2-format  image  file  instead  of a normal image file, suitable for use by virtual
              machine images, and other tools that can use the <b>.qcow</b> image format. See <b>QCOW2</b> <b>IMAGE</b>  <b>FILES</b>  below
              for details.

       <b>-r</b>     Create a raw image file instead of a normal image file.  See <b>RAW</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>FILES</b> below for details.

       <b>-s</b>     Scramble  directory  entries  and  zero out unused portions of the directory blocks in the written
              image file to avoid revealing information about the contents of the file  system.   However,  this
              will prevent analysis of problems related to hash-tree indexed directories.

</pre><h4><b>RAW</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>-r</b>  option will create a raw image file, which differs from a normal image file in two ways.  First,
       the file system metadata is placed in the same relative offset within <u>image-file</u> as it is in  the  <u>device</u>
       so  that  <b><a href="../man8/debugfs.8.html">debugfs</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man8/dumpe2fs.8.html">dumpe2fs</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man8/losetup.8.html">losetup</a></b>(8), etc. can be run directly on the raw image file.
       In order to minimize the amount of disk space consumed by the raw image file, it is created as  a  sparse
       file.  (Beware of copying or compressing/decompressing this file with utilities that don't understand how
       to  create  sparse  files;  the  file will become as large as the file system itself!)  Secondly, the raw
       image file also includes indirect blocks and directory blocks, which the standard  image  file  does  not
       have.

       Raw  image files are sometimes used when sending file systems to the maintainer as part of bug reports to
       e2fsprogs.  When used in this capacity, the recommended command is as  follows  (replace  <b>hda1</b>  with  the
       appropriate device for your system):

            <b>e2image</b> <b>-r</b> <b>/dev/hda1</b> <b>-</b> <b>|</b> <b>bzip2</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>hda1.e2i.bz2</b>

       This  will  only  send  the metadata information, without any data blocks.  However, the filenames in the
       directory blocks can still reveal information about the contents of the file system that the bug reporter
       may wish to keep confidential.  To address this concern, the <b>-s</b> option can be specified to  scramble  the
       filenames in the image.

       Note  that  this  will  work  even if you substitute <b>/dev/hda1</b> for another raw disk image, or QCOW2 image
       previously created by <b>e2image</b>.

</pre><h4><b>QCOW2</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-Q</b> option will create a QCOW2 image file instead of a normal, or  raw  image  file.   A  QCOW2  image
       contains all the information the raw image does, however unlike the raw image it is not sparse. The QCOW2
       image  minimize  the  amount  of space used by the image by storing it in special format which packs data
       closely together, hence avoiding holes while still minimizing size.

       In order to send file system to the maintainer as a part  of  bug  report  to  e2fsprogs,  use  following
       commands (replace <b>hda1</b> with the appropriate device for your system):

            <b>e2image</b> <b>-Q</b> <b>/dev/hda1</b> <b>hda1.qcow2</b>
            <b>bzip2</b> <b>-z</b> <b>hda1.qcow2</b>

       This  will only send the metadata information, without any data blocks.  As described for <b>RAW</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>FILES</b>
       the <b>-s</b> option can be specified to scramble the file system names in the image.

       Note that the QCOW2 image created by <b>e2image</b> is a regular QCOW2 image and can be processed by tools aware
       of QCOW2 format such as for example <b>qemu-img</b>.

       You can convert a .qcow2 image into a raw image with:

            <b>e2image</b> <b>-r</b> <b>hda1.qcow2</b> <b>hda1.raw</b>

       This can be useful to write a QCOW2 image containing all data to a sparse image file where it can be loop
       mounted, or to a disk partition.  Note that this may not work with QCOW2 images not generated by e2image.

</pre><h4><b>OFFSETS</b></h4><pre>
       Normally a file system starts at the beginning of a partition, and <b>e2image</b> is run on the partition.  When
       working with image files, you don't have the option of using the partition device, so you can specify the
       offset where the file system starts directly with the <b>-o</b> option.  Similarly the <b>-O</b> option  specifies  the
       offset that should be seeked to in the destination before writing the file system.

       For  example,  if  you  have  a  <b>dd</b>  image  of a whole hard drive that contains an ext2 fs in a partition
       starting at 1 MiB, you can clone that image to a block device with:

            <b>e2image</b> <b>-aro</b> <b>1048576</b> <b>img</b> <b>/dev/sda1</b>

       Or you can clone a file system from a block device into an image file, leaving room in the first MiB  for
       a partition table with:

            <b>e2image</b> <b>-arO</b> <b>1048576</b> <b>/dev/sda1</b> <b>img</b>

       If  you  specify at least one offset, and only one file, an in-place move will be performed, allowing you
       to safely move the file system from one offset to another.
