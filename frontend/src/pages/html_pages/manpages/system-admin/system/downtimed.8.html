       downtimed - system downtime monitoring and reporting daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>downtimed</b> [<b>-D</b>] [<b>-d</b> <u>datadir</u>] [<b>-F</b>] [<b>-f</b> <u>timefmt</u>] [<b>-l</b> <u>log</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>pidfile</u>] [<b>-S</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>sleep</u>]
       <b>downtimed</b> <b>-v</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>downtimed</b>  daemon waits in the background, frequently updating a time stamp file on the disk. If the
       daemon is killed with a signal associated with  a  normal  system  shutdown  procedure,  it  records  the
       shutdown time on the disk.

       When  the  daemon  is restarted during the next boot process, it reports how long the system was down and
       whether it was properly shut down or crashed. The downtime report is output to the system  log  or  to  a
       specified log file. Also a record is appended to the downtime database.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-D</b>     Do not create nor update the downtime database.

       <b>-d</b> <u>datadir</u>
              The directory where the time stamp files as well as the downtime database are located. The default
              directory is determined at compile time.

       <b>-F</b>     Do not call <b><a href="../man3/daemon.3.html">daemon</a></b>(3) to <b><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></b>(2) to background. Useful with modern system service managers such as
              <b><a href="../man8/systemd.8.html">systemd</a></b>(8)<b>,</b> <b><a href="../man8/launchd.8.html">launchd</a></b>(8) and others.

       <b>-f</b> <u>timefmt</u>
              Specify  the  time  and date format to use when reporting using <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3) syntax. The default is
              "%F %T".

       <b>-l</b> <u>log</u> Logging destination. If the argument contains a slash (/) it is interpreted to be a path name to a
              log file, which will be created if it does not exist already. Otherwise it  is  interpreted  as  a
              syslog  facility  name.  The default logging destination is "daemon" which means that the messages
              are written to syslog with the daemon facility code.

       <b>-p</b> <u>pidfile</u>
              The location of the file which keeps track of the process ID of the running  daemon  process.  The
              system default location is determined at compile time. May be disabled by specifying "none".

       <b>-S</b>     Normally  <b><a href="../man2/fsync.2.html">fsync</a></b>(2)  is  performed  after  each  update of the time stamp. This option disables the
              <b><a href="../man2/fsync.2.html">fsync</a></b>(2).  It reduces the load on  the  disk  system  but  makes  the  downtime  measurement  less
              reliable.

       <b>-s</b> <u>sleep</u>
              Defines  how  long  to  sleep  between  each  update of the on-disk time stamp file. More frequent
              updates result in more accurate downtime reporting in the case of a system  crash.  Less  frequent
              updates  decrease  the amount of disk writes performed. The default is to sleep 15 seconds between
              each update. If you are using a flash memory based SSD or other disk which has limited  amount  of
              write cycles per block, it might be a good idea to set the sleep time to a higher value to prolong
              the lifetime of the storage device.

       <b>-v</b>     Display the program version number, copyright message and the default settings.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SIGHUP</b> Close and re-open the output log. Use in case you want to rotate the log file.

       <b>SIGTERM</b> <b>and</b> <b>SIGINT</b>
              Terminate gracefully. These signals signify that a graceful system shutdown is in process.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The daemon exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man1/downtimes.1.html">downtimes</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man5/syslog.conf.5.html">syslog.conf</a></b>(5), https://dist.epipe.com/downtimed/

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The reporting accuracy in case of a system crash depends on how often the time stamp is updated.

       Finding  out  the  system  startup  time is very operating system specific.  If the program does not have
       specific code to support your operating system, it assumes  that  the  system  started  when  the  daemon
       started.

       Reporting  is  inaccurate if the system clock changes during system downtime or startup process. Daylight
       saving time changes have no effect as all calculations are done using UTC.
