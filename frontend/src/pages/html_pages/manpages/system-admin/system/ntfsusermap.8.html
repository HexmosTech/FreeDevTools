       ntfsusermap - NTFS Building a User Mapping File

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ntfsusermap</b> <u>windows-system-device</u> <b>[</b><u>other-ntfs-device</u><b>...]</b>

       Where  <u>windows-system-device</u>  is the device containing the Windows system whose users are to be mapped to
       current Linux system.

       And <u>other-ntfs-device</u> is another device containing files which are to be accessed  both  by  the  Windows
       mentioned above and current Linux system.

       the ntfsusermap command must be started as root, and the designated devices must not be mounted.

       Typing ntfsusermap with no args will display a summary of command arguments.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ntfsusermap</b>  creates the file defining the mapping of Windows accounts to Linux logins for users who owns
       files which should be visible from both Windows and Linux.

       It relies on existing files which were created on Windows, trying to locate significant files and  asking
       which Linux user or group should own them. When a Linux owner or group is requested, the reply may be :

       - the uid or gid (numeric or symbolic) of Linux owner or group of the file.
              In that situation, no more file with the same Windows owner will be selected.
       - or no answer, when not able to define the owner or group.
              In  that  situation  another file owned by the same Windows user or group may be selected later so
              that a mapping can be defined.

       The mappings for standard Windows users, such as "Administrator" or "All Users" are  defined  implicitly.
       As a consequence a user mapping should never be defined as Linux root.

       When  there  are no more significant files, ntfsusermap create the mapping file into the file UserMapping
       in the current directory. This file has to be moved to the hidden directory .NTFS-3G in the root  of  all
       the  NTFS  file  systems  to  be  shared  between  Windows and Linux. This requires the file system to be
       mounted, but the created file will not be taken into account if not present at mount  time,  which  means
       the file system has to be unmounted and mounted again for the new mapping file to be taken into account.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       No option is defined for ntfsusermap.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Map the users defined on the Windows system present on /dev/sda1 :

              <b>ntfsusermap</b> <b>/dev/sda1</b>

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ntfsusermap</b>  exits  with a value of 0 when no error was detected, and with a value of 1 when an error was
       detected.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
