</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tune2fs</b> allows the system administrator to adjust various tunable file system parameters on  Linux  ext2,
       ext3,  or ext4 file systems.  The current values of these options can be displayed by using the <b>-l</b> option
       to <b><a href="../man8/tune2fs.8.html">tune2fs</a></b>(8) program, or by using the <b><a href="../man8/dumpe2fs.8.html">dumpe2fs</a></b>(8) program.

       The <u>device</u> specifier can either  be  a  filename  (i.e.,  /dev/sda1),  or  a  LABEL  or  UUID  specifier:
       "<b>LABEL=</b><u>volume-label</u>" or "<b>UUID=</b><u>uuid</u>".  (i.e., LABEL=home or UUID=e40486c6-84d5-4f2f-b99c-032281799c9d).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b> <u>max-mount-counts</u>
              Adjust  the  number  of  mounts after which the file system will be checked by <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8).  If <u>max-</u>
              <u>mount-counts</u> is the string "random", tune2fs will use a random value between 20 and 40.   If  <u>max-</u>
              <u>mount-counts</u>  is  0  or  -1, the number of times the file system is mounted will be disregarded by
              <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8) and the kernel.

              Staggering the mount-counts at which file systems are forcibly checked will avoid all file systems
              being checked at one time when using journaled file systems.

              Mount-count-dependent checking is disabled by default to avoid unanticipated  long  reboots  while
              e2fsck  does  its  work.   If  you are concerned about file system corruptions caused by potential
              hardware problems of kernel bugs, a better solution than mount-count-dependent checking is to  use
              the <b><a href="../man8/e2scrub.8.html">e2scrub</a></b>(8) program.  This does require placing the file system on an LVM volume, however.

       <b>-C</b> <u>mount-count</u>
              Set the number of times the file system has been mounted.  If set to a greater value than the max-
              mount-counts  parameter  set  by  the  <b>-c</b> option, <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8) will check the file system at the next
              reboot.

       <b>-e</b> <u>error-behavior</u>
              Change the behavior of the kernel code when errors are detected.  In  all  cases,  a  file  system
              error  will  cause <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8) to check the file system on the next boot.  <u>error-behavior</u> can be one
              of the following:

                   <b>continue</b>    Continue normal execution.

                   <b>remount-ro</b>  Remount file system read-only.

                   <b>panic</b>       Cause a kernel panic.

       <b>-E</b> <u>extended-options</u>
              Set extended options for the file system.  Extended options are comma separated, and may  take  an
              argument using the equals ('=') sign.  The following extended options are supported:

                   <b>clear_mmp</b>
                          Reset  the MMP block (if any) back to the clean state.  Use only if absolutely certain
                          the device is not currently mounted or being fscked, or major file  system  corruption
                          can result.  Needs '-f'.

                   <b>encoding=</b><u>encoding-name</u>
                          Enable  the  <u>casefold</u> feature in the super block and set <u>encoding-name</u> as the encoding
                          to be used.  If <u>encoding-name</u> is not specified, utf8 is used. The encoding  cannot  be
                          altered if casefold was previously enabled.

                   <b>encoding_flags=</b><u>encoding-flags</u>
                          Define  parameters  for  file  name  character  encoding operations.  If a flag is not
                          changed using this parameter, its default value is used.  <u>encoding-flags</u> should  be  a
                          comma-separated lists of flags to be enabled.  The flags cannot be altered if casefold
                          was previously enabled.

                          The  only  flag  that  can be set right now is <u>strict</u> which means that invalid strings
                          should be rejected by the file system.  In the default configuration, the <u>strict</u>  flag
                          is disabled.

                   <b>force_fsck</b>
                          Set a flag in the file system superblock indicating that errors have been found.  This
                          will force fsck to run at the next mount.

                   <b>hash_alg=</b><u>hash-alg</u>
                          Set  the  default hash algorithm used for file systems with hashed b-tree directories.
                          Valid algorithms accepted are: <u>legacy</u>, <u>half_md4</u>, and <u>tea</u>.

                   <b>mmp_update_interval=</b><u>interval</u>
                          Adjust the initial MMP update interval to <u>interval</u> seconds.  Specifying an <u>interval</u> of
                          0 means to use the default interval.  The specified interval must  be  less  than  300
                          seconds.  Requires that the <b>mmp</b> feature be enabled.

                   <b>mount_opts=</b><u>mount_option_string</u>
                          Set a set of default mount options which will be used when the file system is mounted.
                          Unlike  the  bitmask-based  default  mount  options which can be specified with the <b>-o</b>
                          option, <u>mount_option_string</u> is an arbitrary string with a maximum length of 63  bytes,
                          which is stored in the superblock.

                          The  ext4  file  system driver will first apply the bitmask-based default options, and
                          then parse the <u>mount_option_string</u>, before parsing the mount options passed  from  the
                          <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8) program.

                          This superblock setting is only honored in 2.6.35+ kernels; and not at all by the ext2
                          and ext3 file system drivers.

                   <b>orphan_file_size=</b><u>size</u>
                          Set  size  of  the  file  for  tracking unlinked but still open inodes and inodes with
                          truncate in progress. Larger file allows  for  better  scalability,  reserving  a  few
                          blocks per cpu is ideal.

                   <b>stride=</b><u>stride-size</u>
                          Configure  the  file system for a RAID array with <u>stride-size</u> file system blocks. This
                          is the number of blocks read or written to disk  before  moving  to  next  disk.  This
                          mostly  affects  placement  of  file system metadata like bitmaps at <b><a href="../man2/mke2fs.2.html">mke2fs</a></b>(2) time to
                          avoid placing them on a single disk, which can hurt the performance.  It may  also  be
                          used by block allocator.

                   <b>stripe_width=</b><u>stripe-width</u>
                          Configure  the  file  system for a RAID array with <u>stripe-width</u> file system blocks per
                          stripe. This is typically be stride-size * N, where N is the number of data  disks  in
                          the  RAID  (e.g.  RAID 5 N+1, RAID 6 N+2).  This allows the block allocator to prevent
                          read-modify-write of the parity in a RAID stripe if possible when the data is written.

                   <b>test_fs</b>
                          Set a flag in the file system superblock indicating  that  it  may  be  mounted  using
                          experimental kernel code, such as the ext4dev file system.

                   <b>^test_fs</b>
                          Clear  the  test_fs  flag,  indicating  the  file  system should only be mounted using
                          production-level file system code.

       <b>-f</b>     Force the tune2fs operation to complete even in the face of errors.  This option  is  useful  when
              removing  the <b>has_journal</b> file system feature from a file system which has an external journal (or
              is corrupted such that it appears to have an external journal), but that external journal  is  not
              available.    If  the file system appears to require journal replay, the <b>-f</b> flag must be specified
              twice to proceed.

              <b>WARNING:</b> Removing an external journal from a file system which was not cleanly  unmounted  without
              first replaying the external journal can result in severe data loss and file system corruption.

       <b>-g</b> <u>group</u>
              Set  the  group  which  can  use  the  reserved  file system blocks.  The <u>group</u> parameter can be a
              numerical gid or a group name.  If a group name is given, it  is  converted  to  a  numerical  gid
              before it is stored in the superblock.

       <b>-i</b>  <u>interval-between-checks</u>[<b>d</b>|<b>m</b>|<b>w</b>]
              Adjust  the maximal time between two file system checks.  No suffix or <b>d</b> will interpret the number
              <u>interval-between-checks</u> as days, <b>m</b> as months, and <b>w</b> as weeks.  A value of zero  will  disable  the
              time-dependent checking.

              There  are  pros  and  cons  to  disabling  these periodic checks; see the discussion under the <b>-c</b>
              (mount-count-dependent check) option for details.

       <b>-I</b>     Change the inode size used by the file system.   This requires rewriting the inode  table,  so  it
              requires  that  the  file system is checked for consistency first using <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8).  This operation
              can also take a while and the file system can be corrupted and data  lost  if  it  is  interrupted
              while  in  the  middle  of converting the file system.  Backing up the file system before changing
              inode size is recommended.

              File systems with an inode size of 128 bytes do not support timestamps beyond  January  19,  2038.
              Inodes  which  are  256  bytes  or  larger will support extended timestamps, project id's, and the
              ability to store some extended attributes in the inode table for improved performance.

       <b>-j</b>     Add an ext3 journal to the file system.  If the <b>-J</b> option is not specified,  the  default  journal
              parameters  will  be  used  to  create  an appropriately sized journal (given the size of the file
              system) stored within the file system.  Note that you must  be  using  a  kernel  which  has  ext3
              support in order to actually make use of the journal.

              If  this option is used to create a journal on a mounted file system, an immutable file, <b>.journal</b>,
              will be created in the top-level directory of the file system, as it  is  the  only  safe  way  to
              create  the journal inode while the file system is mounted.  While the ext3 journal is visible, it
              is not safe to delete it, or modify it while the file system is mounted; for this reason the  file
              is  marked  immutable.   While  checking unmounted file systems, <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8) will automatically move
              <b>.journal</b> files to the invisible, reserved journal inode.  For all file systems except for the root
              file system,  this should happen automatically and naturally during the next reboot cycle.   Since
              the  root file system is mounted read-only, <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8) must be run from a rescue floppy in order to
              effect this transition.

              On some distributions, such as Debian, if an initial ramdisk is  used,  the  initrd  scripts  will
              automatically  convert  an ext2 root file system to ext3 if the <b><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></b> file specifies the ext3
              file system for the root file system in order to avoid requiring the use of a rescue floppy to add
              an ext3 journal to the root file system.

       <b>-J</b> journal-options
              Override the default ext3 journal parameters. Journal options are comma separated, and may take an
              argument using the equals ('=')  sign.  The following journal options are supported:

                   <b>device=</b><u>external-journal</u>
                          Attach the file system to the journal block device located on  <u>external-journal</u>.   The
                          external journal must have been already created using the command

                          <b>mke2fs</b> <b>-O</b> <b>journal_dev</b> <u>external-journal</u>

                          Note  that <u>external-journal</u> must be formatted with the same block size as file systems
                          which will be using it.  In addition, while there is support  for  attaching  multiple
                          file  systems  to  a  single  external  journal, the Linux kernel and <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8) do not
                          currently support shared external journals yet.

                          Instead of specifying a device name directly, <u>external-journal</u> can also  be  specified
                          by either <b>LABEL=</b><u>label</u> or <b>UUID=</b><u>UUID</u> to locate the external journal by either the volume
                          label  or  UUID  stored  in  the  ext2  superblock  at  the start of the journal.  Use
                          <b><a href="../man8/dumpe2fs.8.html">dumpe2fs</a></b>(8) to display a journal device's volume label and  UUID.   See  also  the  <b>-L</b>
                          option of <b><a href="../man8/tune2fs.8.html">tune2fs</a></b>(8).

                   <b>fast_commit_size=</b><u>fast-commit-size</u>
                          Create  an  additional  fast  commit  journal area of size <u>fast-commit-size</u> kilobytes.
                          This option is only valid if <b>fast_commit</b> feature is enabled on  the  file  system.  If
                          this option is not specified and if <b>fast_commit</b> feature is turned on, fast commit area
                          size  defaults  to  <u>journal-size</u>  /  64  megabytes. The total size of the journal with
                          <b>fast_commit</b> feature set is <u>journal-size</u> + ( <u>fast-commit-size</u> *  1024)  megabytes.  The
                          total journal size may be no more than 10,240,000 file system blocks or half the total
                          file system size (whichever is smaller).

                   <b>location</b><u>=journal-location</u>
                          Specify  the  location  of  the  journal.  The argument <u>journal-location</u> can either be
                          specified as a block number, or if the number has a  units  suffix  (e.g.,  'M',  'G',
                          etc.) interpret it as the offset from the beginning of the file system.

                   <b>size=</b><u>journal-size</u>
                          Create  a journal stored in the file system of size <u>journal-size</u> megabytes.   The size
                          of the journal must be at least 1024 file system blocks  (i.e.,  1  MiB  if  using  1k
                          blocks,  4  MiB  if  using  4k  blocks, etc.)  and may be no more than 10,240,000 file
                          system blocks.  There must be enough free space in the file system to create a journal
                          of that size.

              Only one of the <b>size</b> or <b>device</b> options can be given for a file system.

       <b>-l</b>     List the contents of the file system superblock, including the current values  of  the  parameters
              that can be set via this program.

       <b>-L</b> <u>volume-label</u>
              Set  the  volume  label  of the file system.  Ext2 file system labels can be at most 16 characters
              long; if <u>volume-label</u> is longer than 16 characters, <b>tune2fs</b> will truncate it and print a  warning.
              For other file systems that support online label manipulation and are mounted <b>tune2fs</b> will work as
              well,  but  it will not attempt to truncate the <u>volume-label</u> at all.  The volume label can be used
              by <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man8/fsck.8.html">fsck</a></b>(8), and <b><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></b>(5) (and possibly  others)  by  specifying  <b>LABEL=</b><u>volume-label</u>
              instead of a block special device name like <b>/dev/hda5</b>.

       <b>-m</b> <u>reserved-blocks-percentage</u>
              Set  the  percentage  of  the  file  system  which  may only be allocated by privileged processes.
              Reserving some number of file system blocks for use by privileged processes is done to avoid  file
              system  fragmentation,  and  to  allow system daemons, such as <b><a href="../man8/syslogd.8.html">syslogd</a></b>(8), to continue to function
              correctly after non-privileged processes are prevented from writing to the file system.  Normally,
              the default percentage of reserved blocks is 5%.

       <b>-M</b> <u>last-mounted-directory</u>
              Set the last-mounted directory for the file system.

       <b>-o</b> [^]<u>mount-option</u>[,...]
              Set or clear the indicated default mount options in the file system.  Default mount options can be
              overridden by mount options specified either in <b><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></b>(5) or on the command line arguments  to
              <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8).  Older kernels may not support this feature; in particular, kernels which predate 2.4.20
              will almost certainly ignore the default mount options field in the superblock.

              More  than  one  mount  option  can  be  cleared or set by separating features with commas.  Mount
              options prefixed with a caret character ('^') will be cleared in  the  file  system's  superblock;
              mount  options without a prefix character or prefixed with a plus character ('+') will be added to
              the file system.

              The following mount options can be set or cleared using <b>tune2fs</b>:

                   <b>debug</b>  Enable debugging code for this file system.

                   <b>bsdgroups</b>
                          Emulate BSD behavior when creating new files: they  will  take  the  group-id  of  the
                          directory  in which they were created.  The standard System V behavior is the default,
                          where newly created files take on  the  fsgid  of  the  current  process,  unless  the
                          directory  has  the  setgid  bit  set,  in which case it takes the gid from the parent
                          directory, and also gets the setgid bit set if it is a directory itself.

                   <b>user_xattr</b>
                          Enable user-specified extended attributes.

                   <b>acl</b>    Enable Posix Access Control Lists.

                   <b>uid16</b>  Disables 32-bit UIDs and GIDs.  This is for interoperability with older kernels  which
                          only store and expect 16-bit values.

                   <b>journal_data</b>
                          When  the file system is mounted with journaling enabled, all data (not just metadata)
                          is committed into the journal prior to being written into the main file system.

                   <b>journal_data_ordered</b>
                          When the file system is mounted with journaling enabled, all data is  forced  directly
                          out to the main file system prior to its metadata being committed to the journal.

                   <b>journal_data_writeback</b>
                          When  the file system is mounted with journaling enabled, data may be written into the
                          main file system after its metadata has been  committed  to  the  journal.   This  may
                          increase  throughput,  however, it may allow old data to appear in files after a crash
                          and journal recovery.

                   <b>nobarrier</b>
                          The file system will be mounted with  barrier  operations  in  the  journal  disabled.
                          (This  option  is  currently  only supported by the ext4 file system driver in 2.6.35+
                          kernels.)

                   <b>block_validity</b>
                          The file system will be mounted with the block_validity option enabled,  which  causes
                          extra  checks  to  be  performed  after reading or writing from the file system.  This
                          prevents corrupted metadata blocks from causing  file  system  damage  by  overwriting
                          parts  of  the  inode  table  or  block  group descriptors.  This comes at the cost of
                          increased memory and CPU overhead, so it  is  enabled  only  for  debugging  purposes.
                          (This  option  is  currently  only supported by the ext4 file system driver in 2.6.35+
                          kernels.)

                   <b>discard</b>
                          The file system will be mounted with the discard mount option.  This  will  cause  the
                          file  system driver to attempt to use the trim/discard feature of some storage devices
                          (such as SSD's and  thin-provisioned  drives  available  in  some  enterprise  storage
                          arrays)  to  inform  the  storage device that blocks belonging to deleted files can be
                          reused for other purposes.  (This option is currently only supported by the ext4  file
                          system driver in 2.6.35+ kernels.)

                   <b>nodelalloc</b>
                          The  file  system will be mounted with the nodelalloc mount option.  This will disable
                          the delayed allocation feature.  (This option is currently only supported by the  ext4
                          file system driver in 2.6.35+ kernels.)

       <b>-O</b> [^]<u>feature</u>[,...]
              Set  or clear the indicated file system features (options) in the file system.  More than one file
              system feature can be cleared or set by separating features with  commas.   File  System  features
              prefixed with a caret character ('^') will be cleared in the file system's superblock; file system
              features  without  a prefix character or prefixed with a plus character ('+') will be added to the
              file system.  For a detailed description of the file system features,  please  see  the  man  page
              <b><a href="../man5/ext4.5.html">ext4</a></b>(5).

              The following file system features can be set or cleared using <b>tune2fs</b>:

                   <b>64bit</b>  Enable the file system to be larger than 2^32 blocks.

                   <b>casefold</b>
                          Enable  support  for file system level casefolding.  The option can be cleared only if
                          filesystem has no directories with <b>F</b> attribute.

                   <b>dir_index</b>
                          Use hashed b-trees to speed up lookups for large directories.

                   <b>dir_nlink</b>
                          Allow more than 65000 subdirectories per directory.

                   <b>ea_inode</b>
                          Allow the value of each extended attribute to be  placed  in  the  data  blocks  of  a
                          separate  inode  if necessary, increasing the limit on the size and number of extended
                          attributes per file.   <b>Tune2fs</b>  currently  only  supports  setting  this  file  system
                          feature.

                   <b>encrypt</b>
                          Enable  support  for  file  system  level encryption.  <b>Tune2fs</b> currently only supports
                          setting this file system feature.

                   <b>extent</b> Enable the use of extent trees to  store  the  location  of  data  blocks  in  inodes.
                          <b>Tune2fs</b> currently only supports setting this file system feature.

                   <b>extra_isize</b>
                          Enable the extended inode fields used by ext4.

                   <b>filetype</b>
                          Store file type information in directory entries.

                   <b>flex_bg</b>
                          Allow  bitmaps and inode tables for a block group to be placed anywhere on the storage
                          media.  <b>Tune2fs</b> will not reorganize the location of the inode  tables  and  allocation
                          bitmaps,  as  <b><a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs</a></b>(8)  will  do when it creates a freshly formatted file system with
                          <b>flex_bg</b> enabled.

                   <b>has_journal</b>
                          Use a journal to  ensure  file  system  consistency  even  across  unclean  shutdowns.
                          Setting the file system feature is equivalent to using the <b>-j</b> option.

                   <b>fast_commit</b>
                          Enable fast commit journaling feature to improve fsync latency.

                   <b>large_dir</b>
                          Increase  the  limit  on  the  number  of files per directory.  <b>Tune2fs</b> currently only
                          supports setting this file system feature.

                   <b>huge_file</b>
                          Support files larger than 2 terabytes in size.

                   <b>large_file</b>
                          File System can contain files that are greater than 2 GiB.

                   <b>metadata_csum</b>
                          Store a checksum to protect the contents in each metadata block.

                   <b>metadata_csum_seed</b>
                          Allow the file system to store the metadata checksum seed in the superblock,  enabling
                          the  administrator to change the UUID of a file system using the <b>metadata_csum</b> feature
                          while it is mounted.

                   <b>mmp</b>    Enable or disable multiple mount protection (MMP) feature.

                   <b>orphan_file</b>
                          Store the list of orphan inodes in multiple blocks instead of a single linked-list  to
                          avoid  potential  scalability bottlenecks for workloads that perform a large number of
                          file truncations or extensions in parallel.

                   <b>project</b>
                          Enable project ID tracking.  This is used for project quota tracking.

                   <b>quota</b>  Enable internal file system quota inodes.

                   <b>read-only</b>
                          Force the kernel to mount the file system read-only.

                   <b>resize_inode</b>
                          Reserve space so the block group descriptor table may grow  in  the  future.   <b>Tune2fs</b>
                          only supports clearing this file system feature.

                   <b>sparse_super</b>
                          Limit  the  number of backup superblocks to save space on large file systems.  <b>Tune2fs</b>
                          currently only supports setting this file system feature.

                   <b>stable_inodes</b>
                          Prevent the file system from being shrunk or having its  UUID  changed,  in  order  to
                          allow  the  use  of specialized encryption settings that make use of the inode numbers
                          and UUID.  <b>Tune2fs</b> currently only supports setting this file system feature.

                   <b>uninit_bg</b>
                          Allow the kernel to initialize bitmaps and inode tables lazily, and  to  keep  a  high
                          watermark for the unused inodes in a file system, to reduce <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8) time.  The first
                          e2fsck  run after enabling this feature will take the full time, but subsequent e2fsck
                          runs will take only a fraction of the original time, depending on how  full  the  file
                          system is.

                   <b>verity</b> Enable  support  for  verity protected files.  <b>Tune2fs</b> currently only supports setting
                          this file system feature.

              After setting or clearing <b>sparse_super</b>, <b>uninit_bg</b>, <b>filetype</b>, or <b>resize_inode</b> file system features,
              the file system may require being  checked  using  <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8)  to  return  the  file  system  to  a
              consistent  state.   <b>Tune2fs</b>  will  print  a  message requesting that the system administrator run
              <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8) if necessary.  After setting the <b>dir_index</b> feature, <b>e2fsck</b> <b>-D</b>  can  be  run  to  convert
              existing  directories  to  the  hashed  B-tree  format.  Enabling certain file system features may
              prevent the file system from being mounted by kernels which do not  support  those  features.   In
              particular, the <b>uninit_bg</b> and <b>flex_bg</b> features are only supported by the ext4 file system.

       <b>-r</b> <u>reserved-blocks-count</u>
              Set the number of reserved file system blocks.

       <b>-Q</b> <u>quota-options</u>
              Sets  'quota'  feature  on  the  superblock and works on the quota files for the given quota type.
              Quota options could be one or more of the following:

                   <b>[^]usrquota</b>
                          Sets/clears user quota inode in the superblock.

                   <b>[^]grpquota</b>
                          Sets/clears group quota inode in the superblock.

                   <b>[^]prjquota</b>
                          Sets/clears project quota inode in the superblock.

       <b>-T</b> <u>time-last-checked</u>
              Set the time the file system was last checked using <b>e2fsck</b>.  The time  is  interpreted  using  the
              current  (local)  timezone.   This  can be useful in scripts which use a Logical Volume Manager to
              make a consistent snapshot of a file system, and then check the file system during  off  hours  to
              make  sure  it hasn't been corrupted due to hardware problems, etc.  If the file system was clean,
              then this option can be used to set the last checked time on the original file system.  The format
              of <u>time-last-checked</u> is the international date format,  with  an  optional  time  specifier,  i.e.
              YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]].   The keyword <b>now</b> is also accepted, in which case the last checked time will
              be set to the current time.

       <b>-u</b> <u>user</u>
              Set  the  user who can use the reserved file system blocks.  <u>user</u> can be a numerical uid or a user
              name.  If a user name is given, it is converted to a numerical uid before  it  is  stored  in  the
              superblock.

       <b>-U</b> <u>UUID</u>
              Set  the  universally unique identifier (UUID) of the file system to <u>UUID</u>.  The format of the UUID
              is a series of hex digits separated by hyphens, like this: "c1b9d5a2-f162-11cf-9ece-0020afc76f16".
              The <u>UUID</u> parameter may also be one of the following:

                   <u>clear</u>  clear the file system UUID

                   <u>random</u> generate a new randomly-generated UUID

                   <u>time</u>   generate a new time-based UUID

              The UUID may be used by <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man8/fsck.8.html">fsck</a></b>(8), and <b><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></b>(5) (and possibly others)  by  specifying
              <b>UUID=</b><u>uuid</u> instead of a block special device name like <b>/dev/hda1</b>.

              See  <b><a href="../man8/uuidgen.8.html">uuidgen</a></b>(8)  for more information.  If the system does not have a good random number generator
              such as <u>/dev/random</u> or <u>/dev/urandom</u>, <b>tune2fs</b> will automatically use a time-based UUID instead of a
              randomly-generated UUID.

       <b>-z</b> <u>undo_file</u>
              Before overwriting a file system block, write the old contents of the block to an undo file.  This
              undo file can be used with <a href="../man8/e2undo.8.html">e2undo</a>(8) to restore  the  old  contents  of  the  file  system  should
              something  go  wrong.  If the empty string is passed as the undo_file argument, the undo file will
              be  written  to  a  file  named  tune2fs-<u>device</u>.e2undo  in  the  directory   specified   via   the
              <u>E2FSPROGS_UNDO_DIR</u> environment variable.

              WARNING: The undo file cannot be used to recover from a power or system crash.
