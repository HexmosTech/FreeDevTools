       plpfuse - Daemon to mount an EPOC device as a file system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>plpfuse</b> <b>[-V]</b> <b>[-d]</b> <b>[-h]</b> <b>[-p</b> <b>[</b><u>HOST</u><b>:]</b><u>PORT</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>LONG-OPTIONS</u><b>]</b> <b>MOUNTPOINT</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       plpfuse  is  a  file  system  which  provides file system access to your EPOC device.  It mounts the EPOC
       device's file systems in your computer's file system.  Like the  other  front-ends,  this  program  auto-
       reconnects  after  a  link failure, so you can keep the EPOC device mounted all the time, even when it is
       not connected.  Due to Rudolf Koenig's clever error handling, you don't need to worry about  blocked  I/O
       processes  if  the  psion  isn't  available.   You  will simply get a "device not configured" error, when
       accessing a file on a previously connected psion which has been disconnected. After that, the mount point
       will appear with the drives missing. As soon as the psion is connected  again,  the  subdirectories  will
       reappear (possibly with a few seconds' delay).

       EPOC  file  attributes  are  mapped as follows: readable on the EPOC device is mapped to user-readable on
       UNIX; read-only is inverted and mapped to user-writable; system, hidden and archived are  mapped  to  the
       extended  user attribute <b>user.psion</b> as the single characters `s', `h' and `a'. The extended attribute can
       therefore be up to three characters long. An attempt to read or write any other extended  attribute  will
       give an error.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Display the version and exit

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display a short help text and exit.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b>
              Produce  debugging  logs.  Can  be  specified  more than once to increase the debug level (up to 3
              times).

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--port=[</b><u>host</u><b>:]</b><u>port</u>
              Specify the host and port to connect to (e.g. the port where ncpd is listening on)  -  by  default
              the  host  is  127.0.0.1  and  the port is looked up in /etc/services. If it is not found there, a
              fall-back builtin of <u>7501.</u>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Because UNIX file names are simply byte strings, if your EPOC device uses a different character set  from
       the  computer  to  which  it  is connected, which is highly likely, then characters which are differently
       encoded between the two characters sets will not translate between the two systems. it is usually safe to
       use 7-bit ASCII characters, avoiding colon (invalid on EPOC) and slash (invalid on  UNIX).  This  problem
       may be fixed in future.
