       intro - Introduction to the Mandos system

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the the Mandos system, which allows computers to have encrypted root file systems and at the same
       time be capable of remote and/or unattended reboots.

       The computers run a small client program in the initial RAM disk environment which will communicate with
       a server over a network. All network communication is encrypted using TLS. The clients are identified by
       the server using a TLS public key; each client has one unique to it. The server sends the clients an
       encrypted password. The encrypted password is decrypted by the clients using a separate OpenPGP key, and
       the password is then used to unlock the root file system, whereupon the computers can continue booting
       normally.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       You know how it is. You’ve heard of it happening. The Man comes and takes away your servers, your
       friends’ servers, the servers of everybody in the same hosting facility. The servers of their neighbors,
       and their neighbors’ friends. The servers of people who owe them money. And like <u>that</u>, they’re gone. And
       you doubt you’ll ever see them again.

       That is why your servers have encrypted root file systems. However, there’s a downside. There’s no going
       around it: rebooting is a pain. Dragging out that rarely-used keyboard and screen and unraveling cables
       behind your servers to plug them in to type in that password is messy, especially if you have many
       servers. There are some people who do clever things like using serial line consoles and daisy-chain it to
       the next server, and keep all the servers connected in a ring with serial cables, which will work, if
       your servers are physically close enough. There are also other out-of-band management solutions, but with
       <u>all</u> these, you still have to be on hand and manually type in the password at boot time. Otherwise the
       server just sits there, waiting for a password.

       Wouldn’t it be great if you could have the security of encrypted root file systems and still have servers
       that could boot up automatically if there was a short power outage while you were asleep? That you could
       reboot at will, without having someone run over to the server to type in the password?

       Well, with Mandos, you (almost) can! The gain in convenience will only be offset by a small loss in
       security. The setup is as follows:

       The server will still have its encrypted root file system. The password to this file system will be
       stored on another computer (henceforth known as the Mandos server) on the same local network. The
       password will <u>not</u> be stored in plaintext, but encrypted with OpenPGP. To decrypt this password, a key is
       needed. This key (the Mandos client key) will not be stored there, but back on the original server
       (henceforth known as the Mandos client) in the initial RAM disk image. Oh, and all network Mandos
       client/server communications will be encrypted, using TLS (SSL).

       So, at boot time, the Mandos client will ask for its encrypted data over the network, decrypt the data to
       get the password, use the password to decrypt the root file system, and the client can then continue
       booting.

       Now, of course the initial RAM disk image is not on the encrypted root file system, so anyone who had
       physical access could take the Mandos client computer offline and read the disk with their own tools to
       get the authentication keys used by a client.  <u>But</u>, by then the Mandos server should notice that the
       original server has been offline for too long, and will no longer give out the encrypted key. The timing
       here is the only real weak point, and the method, frequency and timeout of the server’s checking can be
       adjusted to any desired level of paranoia.

       (The encrypted keys on the Mandos server is on its normal file system, so those are safe, provided the
       root file system of <u>that</u> server is encrypted.)

</pre><h4><b>FREQUENTLY</b> <b>ASKED</b> <b>QUESTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Couldn’t the security be defeated by...

   <b>Grabbing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mandos</b> <b>client</b> <b>key</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>initrd</b> <u><b>really</b></u> <u><b>quickly</b></u>?
       This, as mentioned above, is the only real weak point. But if you set the timing values tight enough,
       this will be really difficult to do. An attacker would have to physically disassemble the client
       computer, extract the key from the initial RAM disk image, and then connect to a <u>still</u> <u>online</u> Mandos
       server to get the encrypted key, and do all this <u>before</u> the Mandos server timeout kicks in and the Mandos
       server refuses to give out the key to anyone.

       Now, as the typical procedure seems to be to barge in and turn off and grab <u>all</u> computers, to maybe look
       at them months later, this is not likely. If someone does that, the whole system <u>will</u> lock itself up
       completely, since Mandos servers are no longer running.

       For sophisticated attackers who <u>could</u> do the clever thing, <u>and</u> had physical access to the server for
       enough time, it would be simpler to get a key for an encrypted file system by using hardware memory
       scanners and reading it right off the memory bus.

   <b>Replay</b> <b>attacks?</b>
       Nope, the network stuff is all done over TLS, which provides protection against that.

   <b>Man-in-the-middle?</b>
       No. The server only gives out the passwords to clients which have <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>TLS</u> <u>handshake</u> proven that they
       do indeed hold the private key corresponding to that client.

   <b>How</b> <b>about</b> <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>and</b> <b>decrypting</b> <b>it</b> <b>later</b> <b>by</b> <b>physically</b> <b>grabbing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mandos</b> <b>client</b> <b>and</b>
       <b>using</b> <b>its</b> <b>key?</b>
       We only use PFS (Perfect Forward Security) key exchange algorithms in TLS, which protects against this.

   <b>Physically</b> <b>grabbing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mandos</b> <b>server</b> <b>computer?</b>
       You could protect <u>that</u> computer the old-fashioned way, with a must-type-in-the-password-at-boot method.
       Or you could have two computers be the Mandos server for each other.

       Multiple Mandos servers can coexist on a network without any trouble. They do not clash, and clients will
       try all available servers. This means that if just one reboots then the other can bring it back up, but
       if both reboot at the same time they will stay down until someone types in the password on one of them.

   <b>Faking</b> <b>checker</b> <b>results?</b>
       If the Mandos client does not have an SSH server, the default is for the Mandos server to use “fping”,
       the replies to which could be faked to eliminate the timeout. But this could easily be changed to any
       shell command, with any security measures you like. If the Mandos client <u>has</u> an SSH server, the default
       configuration (as generated by <b>mandos-keygen</b> with the <b>--password</b> option) is for the Mandos server to use
       an <b>ssh-keyscan</b> command with strict keychecking, which can not be faked. Alternatively, IPsec could be
       used for the ping packets, making them secure.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       So, in summary: The only weakness in the Mandos system is from people who have:

        1. The power to come in and physically take your servers, <u>and</u>

        2. The cunning and patience to do it carefully, one at a time, and <u>quickly</u>, faking Mandos client/server
           responses for each one before the timeout.

       While there are some who may be threatened by people who have <u>both</u> these attributes, they do not,
       probably, constitute the majority.

       If you <u>do</u> face such opponents, you must figure that they could just as well open your servers and read
       the file system keys right off the memory by running wires to the memory bus.

       What Mandos is designed to protect against is <u>not</u> such determined, focused, and competent attacks, but
       against the early morning knock on your door and the sudden absence of all the servers in your server
       room. Which it does nicely.

</pre><h4><b>PLUGINS</b></h4><pre>
       In the early designs, the <b><a href="../man8mandos/mandos-client.8mandos.html">mandos-client</a></b>(8mandos) program (which retrieves a password from the Mandos
       server) also prompted for a password on the terminal, in case a Mandos server could not be found. Other
       ways of retrieving a password could easily be envisoned, but this multiplicity of purpose was seen to be
       too complex to be a viable way to continue. Instead, the original program was separated into <b><a href="../man8mandos/mandosclient.8mandos.html">mandos-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man8mandos/mandosclient.8mandos.html">client</a></b>(8mandos) and <b><a href="../man8mandos/password-prompt.8mandos.html">password-prompt</a></b>(8mandos), and a <b><a href="../man8mandos/plugin-runner.8mandos.html">plugin-runner</a></b>(8mandos) exist to run them both in
       parallel, allowing the first successful plugin to provide the password. This opened up for any number of
       additional plugins to run, all competing to be the first to find a password and provide it to the plugin
       runner.

       Four additional plugins are provided:

       <b><a href="../man8mandos/plymouth.8mandos.html">plymouth</a></b>(8mandos)
           This prompts for a password when using <b><a href="../man8/plymouth.8.html">plymouth</a></b>(8).

       <b><a href="../man8mandos/usplash.8mandos.html">usplash</a></b>(8mandos)
           This prompts for a password when using <b><a href="../man8/usplash.8.html">usplash</a></b>(8).

       <b><a href="../man8mandos/splashy.8mandos.html">splashy</a></b>(8mandos)
           This prompts for a password when using <b><a href="../man8/splashy.8.html">splashy</a></b>(8).

       <b><a href="../man8mandos/askpass-fifo.8mandos.html">askpass-fifo</a></b>(8mandos)
           To provide compatibility with the "askpass" program from cryptsetup, this plugin listens to the same
           FIFO as askpass would do.

       More plugins can easily be written and added by the system administrator; see the section called "WRITING
       PLUGINS" in <b><a href="../man8mandos/plugin-runner.8mandos.html">plugin-runner</a></b>(8mandos) to learn the plugin requirements.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEMD</b></h4><pre>
       More advanced startup systems like <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1), already have their own plugin-like mechanisms for allowing
       multiple agents to independently retrieve a password and deliver it to the subsystem requesting a
       password to unlock the root file system. On these systems, it would make no sense to run <b><a href="../man8mandos/pluginrunner.8mandos.html">plugin-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man8mandos/pluginrunner.8mandos.html">runner</a></b>(8mandos), the plugins of which would largely duplicate the work of (and conflict with) the
       existing systems prompting for passwords.

       As for <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) in particular, it has its own <b>Password</b> <b>Agents</b>[1] system. Mandos uses this via its
       <b><a href="../man8mandos/password-agent.8mandos.html">password-agent</a></b>(8mandos) program, which is run instead of <b><a href="../man8mandos/plugin-runner.8mandos.html">plugin-runner</a></b>(8mandos) when <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) is used
       during system startup.
