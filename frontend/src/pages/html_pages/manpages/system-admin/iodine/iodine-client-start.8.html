       iodine-client-start - start an iodine IPv4-over-DNS tunnel

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>iodine-client-start</b> [<u>option</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       'iodine-client-start' starts an iodine IP-over-DNS tunnel.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print help and exit

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print version info and exit

       Invoking  the program without options attempts to set up and configure an iodine IP-over-DNS tunnel using
       the configuration in the file <u>/etc/default/iodine-client</u> or by querying the user. It tries to figure  out
       the right way to set things up by observing the network, and if all else fails by guessing.

       QUICK CONFIGURATION

       Put two lines in the file <u>/etc/default/iodine-client</u>

              subdomain=your.tunnel.sub.domain

              passwd=password_for_that_tunnel

       or invoke the script with those environment variables set:

              env subdomain=xxx passwd=xxx iodine-client-start

       If these are not set, the script will query the user for them.

       DETAILS

       The  configuration file consists of lines which are either comments starting with '#', or settings of the
       form VAR="val". Valid VARs are:

       subdomain

              Sample value: your.tunnel.sub.domain (no default, must be set)

       passwd

              Sample value: password_for_that_tunnel (no default, must be set)

       testhost

              Hostname to ping when testing if network is working (default: slashdot.org)

       bounce_localnet

              Take the local network down and then up again before starting tunnel (default: false)

       test_ping_localnet

              Test if the local network is working by pinging the gateway (default: true)

       test_ping_tunnel

              Test if the iodine tunnel is working after it has been set up by pinging the host at the other end
              (default: true)

       test_ping_final

              Test if the tunnel is working after everything is ostensibly set up by trying to ping an  external
              host (default: true)

       default_router

              IP  address of router on the local network---should be found automatically, set this if that fails
              and the program guesses wrong.

       interface

              Interface to use (e.g., eth1, eth0, etc)  for  connection  to  DNS  server  used  for  the  iodine
              tunnel---should be found automatically, set this if that fails and the program guesses wrong.

       mtu

              Set  if  tunnel  MTU  needs  to be manually changed (lowered). Should not be necessary anymore, as
              recent versions of  iodine  negotiate  an  appropriate  MTU  during  tunnel  setup.  But  if  that
              negotiation  does  not  happen, or if you are using an older version of iodine, the default tunnel
              MTU is 1024, and if the local DNS server restricts to 512 byte packets you might need  to  use  an
              MTU of 220.

       skip_raw_udp_mode

              Set  "-r"  option  in  iodine  command  line. With this option, iodine does not try to establish a
              direct UDP socket to the iodine server on port 53. (default: true).

       continue_on_error

              Set if the script should continue even if a command fails.  Use to test  script  when  running  as
              non-root. Defaults to false if running as root, true otherwise.
