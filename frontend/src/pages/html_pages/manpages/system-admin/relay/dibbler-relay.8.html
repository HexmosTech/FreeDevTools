</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dibbler-relay - a portable DHCPv6 relay

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dibbler-relay</b>  is  a  portable implementation of the DHCPv6 relay. DHCPv6 relays are proxies, which allow
       one server to support links, which server is not directly connected to. There  are  ports  available  for
       Linux  2.4/2.6 systems as well as MS Windows XP and 2003. They are freely available under <b>GNU</b> <b>GPL</b> version
       2 (or later) license.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dibbler-relay</b> [ run | start | stop | status ]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>run</u> - starts relay in the console. Relay can be closed using ctrl-c.

       <u>start</u> - starts relay in daemon mode.

       <u>stop</u> - stops running relay.

       <u>status</u> - shows status of the relay.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Relay forwards DHCPv6 messages between interfaces. Messages from client are encapsulated and forwarded as
       RELAY_FORW messages. Replies from server are received as RELAY_REPL message.  After  decapsulation,  they
       are being sent back to clients.

       It  is vital to inform server, where this relayed message was received. DHCPv6 does this using interface-
       id option. This identifier must be unique. Otherwise relays will get  confused  when  they  will  receive
       reply  from  server.  Note  that this id does not need to be alligned with system interface id (ifindex).
       Think about it as "ethernet segment identifier" if you are using Ethernet network or as "bss  identifier"
       if you are using 802.11 network.

       Let's  assume  this case: relay has 2 interfaces: eth0 and eth1. Clients are located on the eth1 network.
       Relay should receive data on that interface using well-known ALL_DHCP_RELAYS_AND_SERVER multicast address
       (ff02::1:2). Relay also listens on its global address 2000::123. Packets received on the eth1  should  be
       forwarded on the eth0 interface, also using multicast address:

       log-level 8
       log-mode short

       iface eth0 {
         server multicast yes
       }

       iface eth1 {
         client multicast yes
         client unicast 2000::123
         interface-id 1000
       }

       Here  is another exmaple. This time messages should be forwarded from eth1 and eth3 to the eth0 interface
       (using multicast) and to the eth2 interface (using server's global address 2000::546). Also clients  must
       use multicasts (the default approach):

       iface eth0 {
         server multicast yes
       }

       iface eth2 {
         server unicast 2000::456
       }

       iface eth1 {
         client multicast yes
         interface-id 1000
       }

       iface eth3 {
         client multicast yes
         interface-id 1001
       }

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       All  files are created in the /var/lib/dibbler directory. During operation, Dibbler saves various file in
       that directory. Dibbler relay reads /etc/dibbler/relay.conf file. Log file is named client.log.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       This implementation aims at conformance to the following standards:

       <u>RFC</u> <u>3315</u> DHCP for IPv6

       <u>RFC</u> <u>3736</u> Stateless DHCPv6

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Bugs are tracked with bugzilla, available at <u><a href="http://klub.com.pl/bugzilla/">http://klub.com.pl/bugzilla/</a></u>. If you belive you have found a
       bug, don't hesitate to report it.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       Dibbler was developed as master thesis on the Technical University of  Gdansk  by  Tomasz  Mrugalski  and
       Marek  Senderski.  Currently Marek has not enough free time, so this project is being developed by Tomasz
       Mrugalski. Author can be reached at <a href="mailto:thomson@klub.com.pl">thomson@klub.com.pl</a>.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       There are <a href="../man8/dibbler-server.8.html">dibbler-server</a>(8) and <a href="../man8/dibbler-client.8.html">dibbler-client</a>(8) manual pages available. You are also advised to take  a
       look  at project website located at <u><a href="http://klub.com.pl/dhcpv6/">http://klub.com.pl/dhcpv6/</a></u>.  As far as authors know, this is the only
       Windows DHCPv6 stateful implementation available and the only one with relay support. It is also  one  of
       two    freely    available    under   Linux.   The   other   Linux   implementation   is   available   at
       <u><a href="http://dhcpv6.sourceforge.net">http://dhcpv6.sourceforge.net</a></u>, but it is rather outdated and seems not being actively developed.
