</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xymond_client - xymond worker module for client data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xymond_channel</b> <b>--channel=client</b> <b>xymond_client</b> <b>[options]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       xymond_client  is  a  worker  module for xymond, and as such it is normally run via the <u><a href="../man8/xymond_channel.8.html">xymond_channel</a>(8)</u>
       program. It receives xymond client messages sent from systems that have the the Xymon  client  installed,
       and  use  the  client  data to generate the Xymon status messages for the cpu-, disk-, memory- and procs-
       columns. It also feeds Xymon data messages with the netstat- and vmstat-data collected by the client.

       When generating these status messages from the client data,  xymond_client  will  use  the  configuration
       rules defined in the <u><a href="../man5/analysis.cfg.5.html">analysis.cfg</a>(5)</u> file to determine the color of each status message.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --clear-color=COLOR
              Define  the  color  used when sending "msgs", "files" or "ports" reports and there are no rules to
              check for these statuses. The default is to show a "clear" status, but some people prefer to  have
              it  "green".   If you would rather prefer not to see these status columns at all, then you can use
              the "--no-clear-msgs", "--no-clear-files" and "--no-clear-ports" options instead.

       --no-clear-msgs
              If there are no logfile checks, the "msgs" column will show a "clear" status. If you would  rather
              avoid  having  a  "msgs"  column,  this  option causes xymond_client to not send in a clear "msgs"
              status.

       --no-clear-files
              If there are no file checks, the "files" column will show a "clear" status. If  you  would  rather
              avoid  having  a  "files"  column, this option causes xymond_client to not send in a clear "files"
              status.

       --no-clear-ports
              If there are no port checks, the "ports" column will show a "clear" status. If  you  would  rather
              avoid  having  a  "ports"  column, this option causes xymond_client to not send in a clear "ports"
              status.

       --no-ps-listing
              Normally the "procs" status message includes the full process-listing received from the client. If
              you prefer to just have the monitored processes shown, this option will  turn  off  the  full  ps-
              listing.

       --no-port-listing
              Normally the "ports" status message includes the full netstat-listing received from the client. If
              you  prefer  to  just  have the monitored ports shown, this option will turn off the full netstat-
              listing.

       --no-cpu-listing
              Normally the "cpu" status message includes the full cpu-listing received from the client.  If  you
              prefer to just have the monitored cpu load shown, this option will turn off the full cpu-listing.

       --uptime-status
              Generate  a  separate  "uptime"  status  column. The uptime is normally just reported in the "cpu"
              status column, but if you would like a separate status column for the uptime,  you  can  use  this
              option.  It  is  useful  if you want to generate an alert in case of a reboot, without having this
              alert mixed in with the cpu load alerts.

       --config=FILENAME
              Sets the filename for the <u>analysis.cfg</u> file. The default value  is  "etc/analysis.cfg"  below  the
              Xymon server directory.

       --unknownclientosok
              Expect  and  attempt  to  parse  clients with unknown CLIENTOS types.  Useful if you're submitting
              custom host responses with file or msgs data that you'd like to parse.

       --dump-config
              Dumps the configuration after parsing it. May be useful to track down problems with  configuration
              file errors.

       --test Starts an interactive session where you can test the analysis.cfg configuration.

       --collectors=COLLECTOR1[,COLLECTOR2,...]
              Limit  the  set  of  collector  modules  that xymond_client will handle. This is not normally used
              except for running experimental versions of the program.

       --debug
              Enable debugging output.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       ~xymon/server/etc/analysis.cfg

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The "disk" status cannot handle filesystems containing whitespace in the filesystem (device) name.
