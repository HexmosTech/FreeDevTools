       xymonfetch - fetch client data from passive clients

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xymonfetch</b> <b>[--server=XYMON.SERVER.IP]</b> <b>[options]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This utility is used to collect data from Xymon clients.

       Normally,  Xymon  clients  will  themselves  take care of sending all of their data directly to the Xymon
       server. In that case, you do not need this utility at all. However, in some network setups clients may be
       prohibited from establishing a connection to an external server such as the Xymon server, due to firewall
       policies. In such a setup you can configure the client to  store  all  of  the  client  data  locally  by
       enabling  the <u><a href="../man8/msgcache.8.html">msgcache</a>(8)</u> utility on the client, and using <b>xymonfetch</b> on the Xymon server to collect data
       from the clients.

       xymonfetch will only collect data from clients that have the <b>pulldata</b>  tag  listed  in  the  <u><a href="../man5/hosts.cfg.5.html">hosts.cfg</a>(5)</u>
       file.  The  IP-address  listed  in the hosts.cfg file must be correct, since this is the IP-address where
       xymonfetch will attempt to contact the client.  If the msgcache daemon is running on a  non-standard  IP-
       address  or portnumber, you can specify the portnumber as in <b>pulldata=192.168.1.2:8084</b> for contacting the
       msgcache daemon using IP 192.168.1.2 port 8084. If the IP-address is  omitted,  the  default  IP  in  the
       hosts.cfg  file  is  used.  If  the port number is omitted, the portnumber from the XYMONDPORT setting in
       <u><a href="../man5/xymonserver.cfg.5.html">xymonserver.cfg</a>(5)</u> is used (normally, this is port 1984).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --server=XYMON.SERVER.IP
              Defines the IP address of the Xymon server where the collected client messages are  forwarded  to.
              By default, messages are sent to the loopback address 127.0.0.1, i.e. to a Xymon server running on
              the same host as xymonfetch.

       --interval=N
              Sets the interval (in seconds) between polls of a client. Default: 60 seconds.

       --id=N Used  when  you have a setup with multiple Xymon servers. In that case, you must run xymonfetch on
              each of the Xymon servers, with xymonfetch instance using a different  value  of  N.  This  allows
              several  Xymon  servers  to  pick  up  data  from  the  clients running msgcache, and msgcache can
              distinguish between which messages have already been forwarded to which server.
              N is a number in the range 1-31.

       --log-interval=N
              Limit how often xymonfetch will log problems with fetching data from a host, in seconds.  Default:
              900  seconds  (15  minutes). This is to prevent a host that is down or where msgcache has not been
              started from flooding the xymonfetch logs. Note that this is ignored when debugging is enabled.

       --debug
              Enable debugging output.
