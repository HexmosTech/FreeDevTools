</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dibbler-client - a portable DHCPv6 client

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dibbler-client</b>  is  a  portable implementation of the DHCPv6 client. It supports both stateful (i.e. IPv6
       address granting) and stateless (i.e. options granting) autoconfiguration. There are ports available  for
       Linux  2.4/2.6 systems as well as MS Windows XP and 2003. They are freely available under <b>GNU</b> <b>GPL</b> version
       2 (or later) license.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dibbler-client</b> [ run | start | stop | status | install | uninstall ]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>run</u> - starts client in the console. Client can be closed using ctrl-c.

       <u>start</u> - starts client in daemon mode.

       <u>stop</u> - stops running clients.

       <u>status</u> - shows status of the client and server.

       <u>install</u> - installs client as a service. This is not implemented yet.

       <u>uninstall</u> - uninstall client service. This is not implemented yet.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Let's start with simple configuration. We want receive one IPv6 address and there is  only  one  Ethernet
       interface  present.  In  that case client.conf file might be completly empty. Dibbler client will request
       for one IPv6 address on each up, running and multicast capable interface (except loopback).

       Now some real example. We want one IPv6 address and receive DNS servers and domain name. We are also  not
       interested in the details, so debug mode is disabled.

       log-mode short
       log-level 6
       iface eth0
       {
         ia { }
          option dns-server
          option domain
       }

       Next  example: we want only NIS domain and NIS server information. That information should be periodicaly
       renewed, so we use lifetime option. We don't need any addresses so stateless mode is used.

       log-mode short
       iface eth0
       {
         stateless
         option nis-server
         option nis-domain
         option lifetime
       }

       More examples can be found in the User's Guide.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       All   files   are    created    in    the    /var/lib/dibbler    directory.    Dibbler    client    reads
       /var/lib/dibbler/client.conf  file. During operation, Dibbler saves various file in that directory. After
       reception of the DNS servers or domain informations, they are added to the <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a>  file.  After
       shutdown, that information is removed from that file. Option values are stored in the option-* files. Log
       file is named client.log.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       This implementation aims at conformance to the following standards:

       <u>RFC</u> <u>3315</u> DHCP for IPv6

       <u>RFC</u> <u>3319</u> SIP options for DHCPv6

       <u>RFC</u> <u>3646</u> DNS server options for DHCPv6

       <u>RFC</u> <u>3736</u> Stateless DHCPv6

       <u>RFC</u> <u>3898</u> NIS options for DHCPv6

       Also options specified in following drafts are implemented:

       <u>draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-opt-timeconfig-03.txt</u> NTP and timezone options.

       <u>draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-opt-lifetime-00.txt</u> Option renewal.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Bugs are tracked with bugzilla, available at <u><a href="http://klub.com.pl/bugzilla/">http://klub.com.pl/bugzilla/</a></u>. If you belive you have found a
       bug, don't hesitate to report it.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       Dibbler  was  developed  as  master  thesis on the Technical University of Gdansk by Tomasz Mrugalski and
       Marek Senderski. Currently Marek has not enough free time, so this project is being developed  by  Tomasz
       Mrugalski. Authors can be reached at <a href="mailto:thomson@klub.com.pl">thomson@klub.com.pl</a> and <a href="mailto:msend@o2.pl">msend@o2.pl</a>

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       There is <a href="../man8/dibbler-server.8.html">dibbler-server</a>(8) manual page. You are also advised to take a look at project website located at
       <u><a href="http://klub.com.pl/dhcpv6/">http://klub.com.pl/dhcpv6/</a></u>.   As  far  as  authors  know,  this  is  the  only  Windows  DHCPv6  stateful
       implementation available. It  is  also  one  of  two  freely  available  under  Linux.  The  other  Linux
       implementation  is  available  at  <u><a href="http://dhcpv6.sourceforge.net">http://dhcpv6.sourceforge.net</a></u>, but it is rather outdated and seems not
       being actively developed.
