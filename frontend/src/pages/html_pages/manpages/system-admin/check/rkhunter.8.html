</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rkhunter - RootKit Hunter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rkhunter</b> {--check | --unlock | --update | --versioncheck |
                 --propupd [{filename | directory | package name},...] |
                 --list [tests | {lang | languages} | rootkits | perl |
                         propfiles] |
                 --config-check | --version | --help} [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rkhunter</b>  is  a shell script which carries out various checks on the local system to try and detect known
       rootkits and malware. It also performs checks to see if  commands  have  been  modified,  if  the  system
       startup  files  have  been  modified,  and various checks on the network interfaces, including checks for
       listening applications.

       <b>rkhunter</b> has been written to be as generic as possible, and so should run on most Linux and UNIX systems.
       It is provided with some support scripts should certain commands be missing from the system, and some  of
       these  are  perl  scripts.   <b>rkhunter</b>  does  require  certain commands to be present for it to be able to
       execute. Additionally, some tests require specific commands, but if these are not present then  the  test
       will  be skipped. <b>rkhunter</b> needs to be run under a Bourne-type shell, typically <b>bash</b> or <b>ksh</b>. <b>rkhunter</b> can
       be run as a cron job or from the command-line.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If no command option is given, then <b>--help</b> is assumed.  <b>rkhunter</b> will return a non-zero exit code if  any
       error or warning occurs.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--check</b>
              This  command  option  tells <b>rkhunter</b> to perform various checks on the local system. The result of
              each test will be displayed on stdout. If anything suspicious is found, then  a  warning  will  be
              displayed. A log file of the tests and the results will be automatically produced.

              It  is  suggested that this command option is run regularly in order to ensure that the system has
              not been compromised.

       <b>--unlock</b>
              This command option simply unlocks (removes) the lock file. If this option is  used  on  its  own,
              then no log file is created.

       <b>--update</b>
              This  command  option causes <b>rkhunter</b> to check if there is a later version of any of its text data
              files. A command-line web browser, for example <b>wget</b> or <b>lynx</b>, must be present on  the  system  when
              using this option.

              It  is  suggested that this command option is run regularly in order to ensure that the data files
              are kept up to date.

              If this option is used via cron, then it is recommended that the <b>--nocolors</b> option is also used.

              An exit code of zero for this command option means that no updates were available. An exit code of
              one means that a download error occurred, and a code of two  means  that  no  error  occurred  but
              updates were available and have been installed.

       <b>--propupd</b> <b>[{filename</b> <b>|</b> <b>directory</b> <b>|</b> <b>package</b> <b>name},...]</b>
              One  of  the  checks  <b>rkhunter</b>  performs  is to compare various current file properties of various
              commands, against those it has previously stored. This command option causes  <b>rkhunter</b>  to  update
              its data file of stored values with the current values.

              If  the <u>filename</u> option is used, then it must either be a full pathname, or a plain file name (for
              example, 'awk'). When used, then only the entry in the file properties database for that file will
              be updated. If the <u>directory</u> option is used, then only those files listed in the database that are
              in the given directory will be updated. Similarly, if the <u>package</u> <u>name</u> option is used,  then  only
              those  files  in the database which are part of the specified package will be updated. The package
              name must be the base part of the name, no version numbers  should  be  included  -  for  example,
              'coreutils'.  Package  names  will, of course, only be stored in the file properties database if a
              package manager is being used. If a package name is the same as a file name - for example,  'file'
              could refer to the 'file' command or to the RPM 'file' package (which contains the 'file' command)
              -  the  package  name  will  be used.  If no specific option is given, then the entire database is
              updated.

              <u>WARNING:</u> It is the users responsibility to ensure that the files on the  system  are  genuine  and
              from a reliable source. <b>rkhunter</b> can only report if a file has changed, but not on what has caused
              the  change. Hence, if a file has changed, and the <b>--propupd</b> command option is used, then <b>rkhunter</b>
              will assume that the file is genuine.

       <b>--versioncheck</b>
              This command option causes <b>rkhunter</b> to check if there  is  a  later  version  of  the  program.  A
              command-line web browser must be present on the system when using this option.

              If this option is used via cron, then it is recommended that the <b>--nocolors</b> option is also used.

              An exit code of zero for this command option means that no new version was available. An exit code
              of one means that an error occurred downloading the latest version number, and a code of two means
              that no error occurred but a new version is available.

       <b>--list</b> <b>[tests</b> <b>|</b> <b>{lang</b> <b>|</b> <b>languages}</b> <b>|</b> <b>rootkits</b> <b>|</b> <b>perl</b> <b>|</b> <b>propfiles]</b>
              This  command  option  will list some of the supported capabilities of the program, and then exit.
              The <u>tests</u> option lists the currently available test names (see the README file  for  more  details
              about  test names). The <u>languages</u> option lists the currently available languages, and the <u>rootkits</u>
              option lists the  rootkits  that  are  searched  for  by  <b>rkhunter</b>.  The  <u>perl</u>  option  lists  the
              installation  status  of  the perl command and perl modules that may be used by some of the tests.
              Note that it is not <u>required</u> to install these modules. However, if <b>rkhunter</b> is forced to use  perl
              to  execute  a test then the module must be present. The <u>propfiles</u> option will list the file names
              that are used to generate the file properties database. If no specific option is given,  then  all
              the lists, except for the file properties database, are displayed.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--config-check</b>
              This command option causes <b>rkhunter</b> to check its configuration file(s), and then exit. The program
              will run through its normal configuration checks as specified by the enable and disable options on
              the command-line and in the configuration files. That is, only the configuration options for tests
              which  would  normally run are checked. In order to check all the configured options, then use the
              <b>--enable</b> <b>all</b> <b>--disable</b> <b>none</b> options on the command line. Additionally, the program will  check  to
              see  if there are any unrecognised configuration options. If any configuration problems are found,
              then they will be displayed and the return code will be set to 1.

              It is suggested that this option is used whenever the configuration file(s) have been changed.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              This command option causes <b>rkhunter</b> to display its version number, and then exit.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              This command option displays the help screen menu, and then exits.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rkhunter</b> uses a configuration file, named <u>rkhunter.conf</u>, for many of its configuration  options.  It  can
       also use a local configuration file, named <u>rkhunter.conf.local</u>, and a directory named <u>rkhunter.d</u> if it is
       present.   Both  the  local configuration file, and the local directory, must be in the same directory as
       the main configuration file. The installer does not create the local file or directory, but one, or both,
       can be created by the user if required.  If a directory is used,  then  within  the  directory  any  file
       ending in <u>.conf</u> will be treated as a local configuration file.

       Some  options  can  also  be  specified  on  the  command-line,  and  these  will override the equivalent
       configuration file  options.  The  configuration  file  options  are  well  documented  within  the  main
       configuration  file  itself.  The following are the command-line options. The defaults mentioned here are
       the program defaults, unless explicitly stated as the configuration file default.

       <b>--appendlog</b>
              By default a new log file will be created when <b>rkhunter</b> runs, and the previous log  file  will  be
              renamed by having <u>.old</u> appended to its name.  This option tells <b>rkhunter</b> to append to the existing
              log file. If the log file does not exist, then it will be created.

       <b>--bindir</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;...</b>
              This  option modifies which directories <b>rkhunter</b> looks in to find the various commands it requires
              (that is, its PATH). The default is the root PATH, and an internal list  of  some  common  command
              directories.  By  default  a specified directory will be appended to the default list. However, if
              the directory name begins with the '+' character, then it will be prepended to the list (that  is,
              it will be put at the start of the list).

       <b>--cs2,</b> <b>--color-set2</b>
              By  default  <b>rkhunter</b>  will  display  its  test  results  in  color. The colors used are green for
              successful tests, red for failed tests (warnings), and yellow for skipped tests. These colors  are
              visible  when  a  black  background  is used, but are difficult to see on a white background. This
              option tells <b>rkhunter</b> to use a different color set which is more suited to a white background.

       <b>--configfile</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              The installation process will automatically tell <b>rkhunter</b> where its configuration file is located.
              However, if necessary, this option can be used to specify a different pathname.

              If a local configuration file, or directory, is to be used,  then  it  must  reside  in  the  same
              directory as the configuration file specified by this option.

       <b>--cronjob</b>
              This is similar to the <b>--check</b> command option, but it disables several of the interactive options.
              When this option is used <b>--check</b>, <b>--nocolors</b> and <b>--skip-keypress</b> are assumed. By default no output
              is sent to stdout, so the <b>--report-warnings-only</b> option may be useful with this option.

       <b>--dbdir</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              The  installation  process  will  automatically  configure  where  the  data  files are stored for
              <b>rkhunter</b>. However, if necessary, this option can be used to specify  a  different  directory.  The
              directory can be read-only, after installation, provided that neither of the <b>--update</b> or <b>--propupd</b>
              options  are  specified,  and that the <b>--versioncheck</b> option is not specified if ROTATE_MIRRORS is
              set to 1 in the configuration file.

       <b>--debug</b>
              This is a special option mainly for the developers. It  produces  no  output  on  stdout.  Regular
              logging will continue as per default or as specified by the <b>--logfile</b> option, and the debug output
              will be in a randomly generated filename which starts with <u>/tmp/rkhunter-debug</u>.

       <b>--disable</b> <b>&lt;test&gt;[,&lt;test&gt;...]</b>
              This  option  tells  <b>rkhunter</b>  not  to  run  the  specified  tests.  Read the README file for more
              information about test names. By default no tests are disabled.

       <b>--display-logfile</b>
              This option will cause the logfile to be displayed on the screen once <b>rkhunter</b> has finished.

       <b>--enable</b> <b>&lt;test&gt;[,&lt;test&gt;...]</b>
              This option tells <b>rkhunter</b> to only run the specified tests. If only one test name, other than <u>all</u>,
              is given, then the <b>--skip-keypress</b> option is assumed. Read the README file  for  more  information
              about  test  names.  By  default  all tests are enabled. All the test names are listed below under
              TESTS.

       <b>--hash</b> <b>{MD5</b> <b>|</b> <b>SHA1</b> <b>|</b> <b>SHA224</b> <b>|</b> <b>SHA256</b> <b>|</b> <b>SHA384</b> <b>|</b> <b>SHA512</b> <b>|</b>
               <b>NONE</b> <b>|</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;}</b>
              Both the file properties check and the <b>--propupd</b> command  option  will  use  a  hash  function  to
              determine  a  files current hash value. This option tells <b>rkhunter</b> which hash function to use. The
              <u>MD5</u> and <u>SHA</u> options will look for the relevant command, and, if not found, a perl  support  script
              will  then  be  used  to  see  if  a  perl  module  supporting  the  function  has been installed.
              Alternatively, a specific <u>command</u> may be specified. A value of <u>NONE</u> can be used to  indicate  that
              the  hash  values should not be obtained or used as part of the file properties check. The default
              is <u>SHA256</u>.

              Systems using prelinking must use either MD5, SHA1 or NONE.

       <b>--lang,</b> <b>--language</b> <b>&lt;language&gt;</b>
              This option specifies which language to use for the displayed tests and  results.   The  currently
              supported  languages  can  be seen by the <b>--list</b> command option. The default is <u>en</u> (English). If a
              message to be displayed cannot be found in the language file, then the  English  version  will  be
              used.  As such, the English language file must always be present. The <b>--update</b> command option will
              update the language files when new versions are available.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--logfile</b> <b>[file]</b>
              By  default  <b>rkhunter</b>  will  write  out  a  log  file.  The  default  location  of  the  file   is
              <u>/var/log/rkhunter.log</u>. However, this location can be changed by using this option. If <u>/dev/null</u> is
              specified  as  the  log file, then no log file will be written. If no specific <u>file</u> is given, then
              the default will be used. By default <b>rkhunter</b> will create a new log file each time it is run.  Any
              previously existing logfile is moved out of the way, and has <u>.old</u> appended to it.

       <b>--noappend-log</b>
              This  option  reverts  <b>rkhunter</b>  to  its  default behaviour of creating a new log file rather than
              appending to it.

       <b>--nocf</b>
              This option is only valid when the command-line <b>--disable</b> option  is  used.   When  the  <b>--disable</b>
              option  is  used,  by  default,  the  configuration  file  option to disable tests is also used to
              determine which tests to run. If only the <b>--disable</b> option is to be used to determine which  tests
              to run, then <b>--nocf</b> must be given.

       <b>--nocolors</b>
              This  option  causes  the result of each test to not be displayed in a specific color. The default
              color, usually the reverse of the background color, will be used (typically this is just black and
              white).

       <b>--nolog</b>
              This option tells <b>rkhunter</b> not to write anything to a log file.

       <b>--nomow,</b> <b>--no-mail-on-warning</b>
              The configuration file has an option which will cause a simple email message to be sent to a  user
              should  <b>rkhunter</b>  detect any warnings during system checks. This command-line option overrides the
              configuration file option, and prevents an email message from being sent. The  configuration  file
              default is not to email a message.

       <b>--ns,</b> <b>--nosummary</b>
              When the <b>--check</b> command option is used, by default a short summary of results is displayed at the
              end. This option prevents the summary from being displayed.

       <b>--novl,</b> <b>--no-verbose-logging</b>
              During some tests <b>rkhunter</b> will log a lot of information. Use of this option reduces the amount of
              logging,  and  so can improve the performance of <b>rkhunter</b>. However, the log file will contain less
              information should any warnings occur. By default verbose logging is enabled.

       <b>--pkgmgr</b> <b>{RPM</b> <b>|</b> <b>DPKG</b> <b>|</b> <b>BSD</b> <b>|</b> <b>BSDng</b> <b>|</b> <b>SOLARIS</b> <b>|</b> <b>NONE}</b>
              This option is used during the file properties check or  when  the  <b>--propupd</b>  command  option  is
              given.  It  tells  <b>rkhunter</b>  that  the  current  file  property values should be obtained from the
              relevant package manager.  See the README file for more details of this  option.  The  default  is
              <u>NONE</u>, which means not to use a package manager.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              This  option tells <b>rkhunter</b> not to display any output. It can be useful when only the exit code is
              going to be checked. Other options may be used with this one, to force only specific items  to  be
              displayed.

       <b>--rwo,</b> <b>--report-warnings-only</b>
              This  option causes only warning messages to be displayed. This can be useful when <b>rkhunter</b> is run
              via cron. Other options may be used to force other items of information to be displayed.

       <b>--sk,</b> <b>--skip-keypress</b>
              When the <b>--check</b> command option is used, after  certain  sections  of  tests,  the  user  will  be
              prompted  to  press  the  <u>return</u>  key in order to continue. This option disables that feature, and
              <b>rkhunter</b> will run until all the tests have completed.

              If this option has not been given, and the user is prompted to press the <u>return</u> key, a single  '<u>s</u>'
              character,  in  upper-  or  lowercase, may be given followed by the <u>return</u> key. <b>rkhunter</b> will then
              continue the tests without prompting the user again (as if this option had been given).

       <b>--summary</b>
              This option will cause the summary of test results to be displayed. This is the default.

       <b>--syslog</b> <b>[facility.priority]</b>
              When the <b>--check</b> command option is used, this option will cause the start and finish times  to  be
              logged  to  syslog.  The default is not to log anything to syslog, but if the option is used, then
              the default level is <u>authpriv.notice</u>.

       <b>--tmpdir</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              The installation process will automatically configure where temporary files  are  to  be  created.
              However,  if  necessary,  this  option can be used to specify a different directory. The directory
              must not be a symbolic link, and must be secure (root access only).

       <b>--vl,</b> <b>--verbose-logging</b>
              This option tells <b>rkhunter</b> that when it runs some tests, it should  log  as  much  information  as
              possible.  This can be useful when trying to diagnose why a warning has occurred, but it obviously
              also takes more time. The default is to use verbose logging.

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--autox</b>
              When this option is used, <b>rkhunter</b> will try and detect if the X Window system is in use. If it  is
              in  use,  then the second color set will automatically be used (see the <b>--color-set2</b> option). This
              allows <b>rkhunter</b> to be run on, for example, a server console  (where  X  is  not  present,  so  the
              default color set should be used), and on a users terminal (where X is in use, so the second color
              set should be used). In both cases <b>rkhunter</b> will use the correct color set. The configuration file
              default is to try and detect X.

       <b>-X,</b> <b>--no-autox</b>
              This  option  prevents <b>rkhunter</b> from automatically detecting if the X Window system is being used.
              See the <b>--autox</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>TESTS</b></h4><pre>
       [This section to be written]
