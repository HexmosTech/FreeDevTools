</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>restore</b> command performs the inverse function of <b><a href="../man8/dump.8.html">dump</a></b>(8).  A full backup of  a  file  system  may  be
       restored and subsequent incremental backups layered on top of it. Single files and directory subtrees may
       be  restored  from  full  or partial backups.  <b>Restore</b> works across a network; to do this see the <b>-f</b> flag
       described below. Other arguments to the command are file or directory names specifying the files that are
       to be restored. Unless the <b>-h</b> flag is specified (see below), the appearance of a directory name refers to
       the files and (recursively) subdirectories of that directory.

       Exactly one of the following flags is required:

       <b>-C</b>     This mode allows comparison of files from a dump.  <b>Restore</b>  reads  the  backup  and  compares  its
              contents with files present on the disk. It first changes its working directory to the root of the
              filesystem  that was dumped and compares the tape with the files in its new current directory. See
              also the <b>-L</b> flag described below.

       <b>-i</b>     This mode allows interactive restoration of files from a dump.  After  reading  in  the  directory
              information  from  the  dump, <b>restore</b> provides a shell like interface that allows the user to move
              around the directory tree selecting files to be extracted. The available commands are given below;
              for those commands that require an argument, the default is the current directory.

              <b>add</b> [<u>arg</u>]
                     The current directory or specified argument is added to the list of files to be  extracted.
                     If  a  directory  is specified, then it and all its descendants are added to the extraction
                     list (unless the <b>-h</b> flag is  specified  on  the  command  line).  Files  that  are  on  the
                     extraction list are prepended with a “*” when they are listed by <b>ls</b>.

              <b>cd</b> <u>arg</u> Change the current working directory to the specified argument.

              <b>delete</b> [<u>arg</u>]
                     The  current  directory  or  specified  argument  is  deleted  from the list of files to be
                     extracted. If a directory is specified, then it and all its descendants  are  deleted  from
                     the  extraction  list  (unless  the  <b>-h</b>  flag  is  specified on the command line). The most
                     expedient way to extract most of the files from a directory is to add the directory to  the
                     extraction list and then delete those files that are not needed.

              <b>extract</b>
                     All  files  on  the  extraction  list  are extracted from the dump.  <b>Restore</b> will ask which
                     volume the user wishes to mount. The fastest way to extract a few files is  to  start  with
                     the last volume and work towards the first volume.

              <b>help</b>   List a summary of the available commands.

              <b>ls</b> [<u>arg</u>]
                     List  the  current or specified directory. Entries that are directories are appended with a
                     “/”. Entries that have been marked for extraction are prepended with a “*”. If the  verbose
                     flag is set, the inode number of each entry is also listed.

              <b>pwd</b>    Print the full pathname of the current working directory.

              <b>quit</b>   <b>Restore</b> immediately exits, even if the extraction list is not empty.

              <b>setmodes</b>
                     All  directories  that  have been added to the extraction list have their owner, modes, and
                     times set; nothing is extracted from the dump. This is  useful  for  cleaning  up  after  a
                     <b>restore</b> has been prematurely aborted.

              <b>verbose</b>
                     The  sense  of  the <b>-v</b> flag is toggled. When set, the verbose flag causes the <b>ls</b> command to
                     list the inode numbers of all entries. It also causes  <b>restore</b>  to  print  out  information
                     about each file as it is extracted.

       <b>-P</b> <u>file</u>
              <b>Restore</b> creates a new Quick File Access file <u>file</u> from an existing dump file without restoring its
              contents.

       <b>-R</b>     <b>Restore</b>  requests  a particular tape of a multi-volume set on which to restart a full restore (see
              the <b>-r</b> flag below). This is useful if the restore has been interrupted.

       <b>-r</b>     Restore (rebuild) a file system. The target file system should be made  pristine  with  <b><a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs</a></b>(8),
              mounted,  and  the  user <b>cd</b>'d into the pristine file system before starting the restoration of the
              initial level 0 backup. If the level 0 restores successfully, the <b>-r</b> flag may be used  to  restore
              any necessary incremental backups on top of the level 0. The <b>-r</b> flag precludes an interactive file
              extraction and can be detrimental to one's health (not to mention the disk) if not used carefully.
              An example:

                     <b>mke2fs</b> <b>/dev/sda1</b>

                     <b>mount</b> <b>/dev/sda1</b> <b><a href="file:/mnt">/mnt</a></b>

                     <b>cd</b> <b><a href="file:/mnt">/mnt</a></b>

                     <b>restore</b> <b>rf</b> <b>/dev/st0</b>

              Note  that <b>restore</b> leaves a file <u>restoresymtable</u> in the root directory to pass information between
              incremental restore passes.  This file should be  removed  when  the  last  incremental  has  been
              restored.

              <b>Restore</b>,  in  conjunction with <b><a href="../man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs</a></b>(8) and <b><a href="../man8/dump.8.html">dump</a></b>(8), may be used to modify file system parameters
              such as size or block size.

       <b>-t</b>     The names of the specified files are listed if they occur on the backup. If no  file  argument  is
              given,  the  root  directory  is  listed,  which results in the entire content of the backup being
              listed, unless the <b>-h</b> flag has been specified.  Note that the <b>-t</b> flag replaces the function of the
              old <b><a href="../man8/dumpdir.8.html">dumpdir</a></b>(8) program.  See also the <b>-X</b> option below.   If  the  <b>-0</b>  flag  is  used,  the  output
              separator is the null character (instead of the newline character).

       <b>-x</b>     The  named files are read from the given media. If a named file matches a directory whose contents
              are on the backup and the <b>-h</b> flag is not specified, the directory is  recursively  extracted.  The
              owner,  modification  time, and mode are restored (if possible). If no file argument is given, the
              root directory is extracted, which results in the entire content of the  backup  being  extracted,
              unless the <b>-h</b> flag has been specified.  See also the <b>-X</b> option below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following additional options may be specified:

       <b>-a</b>     In  <b>-i</b>  or  <b>-x</b>  mode,  <b>restore</b>  does  ask  the user for the volume number on which the files to be
              extracted are supposed to be (in order to minimise  the  time  by  reading  only  the  interesting
              volumes).  The  <b>-a</b>  option disables this behaviour and reads all the volumes starting with 1. This
              option is useful when the operator does not know on which volume the files  to  be  extracted  are
              and/or when he prefers the longer unattended mode rather than the shorter interactive mode.

       <b>-A</b> <u>archive_file</u>
              Read  the  table  of  contents  from <u>archive_file</u> instead of the media. This option can be used in
              combination with the <b>-t</b>, <b>-i</b>, or <b>-x</b> options, making it possible to check whether files are  on  the
              media without having to mount the media.

       <b>-b</b> <u>blocksize</u>
              The  number  of  kilobytes  per  dump  record. If the <b>-b</b> option is not specified, <b>restore</b> tries to
              determine the media block size dynamically.

       <b>-c</b>     Normally, <b>restore</b> will try to determine  dynamically  whether  the  dump  was  made  from  an  old
              (pre-4.4)  or  new  format file system. The <b>-c</b> flag disables this check, and only allows reading a
              dump in the old format.

       <b>-d</b>     The <b>-d</b> (debug) flag causes <b>restore</b> to print debug information.

       <b>-D</b> <u>filesystem</u>
              The <b>-D</b> flag allows the user to specify the filesystem name when using <b>restore</b> with the  <b>-C</b>  option
              to check the backup.

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>
              Read  the  backup  from  <u>file</u>;  <u>file</u>  may  be  a special device file like <u>/dev/st0</u> (a tape drive),
              <u>/dev/sda1</u> (a disk drive), an ordinary file, or <u>-</u> (the standard input). If the name of the file  is
              of  the  form  <u>host:file</u>  or  <u>user@host:file</u>, <b>restore</b> reads from the named file on the remote host
              using <b><a href="../man8/rmt.8.html">rmt</a></b>(8).

       <b>-F</b> <u>script</u>
              Run script at the beginning of each tape. The device name and the current volume number are passed
              on the command line. The script must return 0 if <b>restore</b> should continue without asking  the  user
              to  change  the  tape, 1 if <b>restore</b> should continue but ask the user to change the tape. Any other
              exit code will cause <b>restore</b> to abort. For security reasons, <b>restore</b> reverts back to the real user
              ID and the real group ID before running the script.

       <b>-h</b>     Extract the actual directory, rather than the files that it references. This prevents hierarchical
              restoration of complete subtrees from the dump.

       <b>-H</b> <u>hash_size</u>
              Use a hashtable having the specified number of entries for storing the directories entries instead
              of a linked list. This hashtable will considerably speed up inode lookups (visible  especially  in
              interactive  mode when adding/removing files from the restore list), but at the price of much more
              memory usage. The default value is 1, meaning no hashtable is used.

       <b>-k</b>     Use Kerberos authentication when contacting the  remote  tape  server.  (Only  available  if  this
              options was enabled when <b>restore</b> was compiled.)

       <b>-L</b> <u>limit</u>
              The <b>-L</b> flag allows the user to specify a maximal number of miscompares when using <b>restore</b> with the
              <b>-C</b> option to check the backup. If this limit is reached, <b>restore</b> will abort with an error message.
              A value of 0 (the default value) disables the check.

       <b>-m</b>     Extract  by  inode  numbers rather than by file name. This is useful if only a few files are being
              extracted, and one wants to avoid regenerating the complete pathname to the file.

       <b>-M</b>     Enables the multi-volume feature (for reading dumps made using the <b>-M</b> option of  dump).  The  name
              specified  with  <b>-f</b> is treated as a prefix and <b>restore</b> tries to read in sequence from <u>&lt;prefix&gt;001,</u>
              <u>&lt;prefix&gt;002</u> etc.

       <b>-N</b>     The <b>-N</b> flag causes <b>restore</b> to perform a full execution as requested by one of <b>-i</b>, <b>-R</b>, <b>-r</b>, <b>t</b>  or  <b>x</b>
              command without actually writing any file on disk.

       <b>-o</b>     The  <b>-o</b>  flag  causes  <b>restore</b>  to automatically restore the current directory permissions without
              asking the operator whether to do so in one of <b>-i</b> or <b>-x</b> modes.

       <b>-q</b>     The <b>-q</b> flag causes <b>restore</b> to abort immediately whenever operator attention is  required,  without
              prompting in case of read errors, tape changes etc.

       <b>-Q</b> <u>file</u>
              Use  the file <u>file</u> in order to read tape position as stored using the dump Quick File Access mode,
              in one of <b>-i</b>, <b>-x</b> or <b>-t</b> mode.

              It is recommended to set up the st driver to return logical tape positions  rather  than  physical
              before  calling  <b>dump/restore</b> with parameter <b>-Q</b>.  Since not all tape devices support physical tape
              positions those tape devices return an error during <b>dump/restore</b> when the st driver is set to  the
              default  physical setting. Please see the <b><a href="../man4/st.4.html">st</a></b>(4) man page, option <b>MTSETDRVBUFFER</b> , or the <b><a href="../man1/mt.1.html">mt</a>(1)</b> man
              page, on how to set the driver to return logical tape positions.

              Before calling <b>restore</b> with parameter <b>-Q</b>, always make sure the st driver is set to return the same
              type of tape position used during the call to <b>dump</b>.  Otherwise <b>restore</b> may be confused.

              This option can be used when restoring from local or remote tapes (see above)  or  from  local  or
              remote files.

       <b>-s</b> <u>fileno</u>
              Read from the specified <u>fileno</u> on a multi-file tape. File numbering starts at 1.

       <b>-T</b> <u>directory</u>
              The  <b>-T</b> flag allows the user to specify a directory to use for the storage of temporary files. The
              default value is <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>.  This flag is most useful when restoring files after having booted  from  a
              floppy.  There  might  be little or no space on the floppy filesystem, but another source of space
              might exist.

       <b>-u</b>     When creating certain types of files, <b>restore</b> may generate a warning diagnostic  if  they  already
              exist  in the target directory. To prevent this, the <b>-u</b> (unlink) flag causes <b>restore</b> to remove old
              entries before attempting to create new ones.

       <b>-v</b>     Normally <b>restore</b> does its work silently. The <b>-v</b> (verbose) flag causes it to type the name of  each
              file it treats preceded by its file type.

       <b>-0</b>     (zero  terminated)  flag  causes the output lines to be zero terminated, not line feed terminated.
              This flag is recognized for <b>-t</b> (listing) only.

       <b>-V</b>     Enables reading multi-volume non-tape mediums like CDROMs.

       <b>-X</b> <u>filelist</u>
              Read list of files to be listed or extracted from the text file  <u>filelist</u>  in  addition  to  those
              specified  on  the  command  line. This can be used in conjunction with the <b>-t</b> or <b>-x</b> commands. The
              file <u>filelist</u> should contain file names separated by newlines.  <u>filelist</u> may be an  ordinary  file
              or <u>-</u> (the standard input).

       <b>-y</b>     Do  not  ask  the  user whether to abort the restore in the event of an error.  Always try to skip
              over the bad block(s) and continue.

       (The 4.3BSD option syntax is implemented for backward compatibility but is not documented here.)

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Complains if it gets a read error. If <b>y</b> has been specified, or the user responds <b>y</b>, <b>restore</b> will  attempt
       to continue the restore.

       If  a  backup  was  made using more than one tape volume, <b>restore</b> will notify the user when it is time to
       mount the next volume. If the <b>-x</b> or <b>-i</b> flag has been specified, <b>restore</b> will also ask  which  volume  the
       user  wishes  to mount. The fastest way to extract a few files is to start with the last volume, and work
       towards the first volume.

       There are numerous consistency checks that can be listed by <b>restore</b>.  Most checks are self-explanatory or
       can “never happen”. Common errors are given below:

       <u>Converting</u> <u>to</u> <u>new</u> <u>file</u> <u>system</u> <u>format</u>
              A dump tape created from the old file system has been loaded. It is automatically converted to the
              new file system format.

       <u>&lt;filename&gt;:</u> <u>not</u> <u>found</u> <u>on</u> <u>tape</u>
              The specified file name was listed in the tape directory, but was not found on the tape.  This  is
              caused  by  tape  read errors while looking for the file, and from using a dump tape created on an
              active file system.

       <u>expected</u> <u>next</u> <u>file</u> <u>&lt;inumber&gt;,</u> <u>got</u> <u>&lt;inumber&gt;</u>
              A file that was not listed in the directory showed up. This can occur when using a dump created on
              an active file system.

       <u>Incremental</u> <u>dump</u> <u>too</u> <u>low</u>
              When doing an incremental restore, a dump that was written before the previous  incremental  dump,
              or that has too low an incremental level has been loaded.

       <u>Incremental</u> <u>dump</u> <u>too</u> <u>high</u>
              When  doing  an  incremental  restore,  a dump that does not begin its coverage where the previous
              incremental dump left off, or that has too high an incremental level has been loaded.

       <u>Tape</u> <u>read</u> <u>error</u> <u>while</u> <u>restoring</u> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>

       <u>Tape</u> <u>read</u> <u>error</u> <u>while</u> <u>skipping</u> <u>over</u> <u>inode</u> <u>&lt;inumber&gt;</u>

       <u>Tape</u> <u>read</u> <u>error</u> <u>while</u> <u>trying</u> <u>to</u> <u>resynchronize</u>
              A tape (or other media) read error has occurred. If a file name is  specified,  its  contents  are
              probably  partially wrong. If an inode is being skipped or the tape is trying to resynchronize, no
              extracted files have been corrupted, though files may not be found on the tape.

       <u>resync</u> <u>restore,</u> <u>skipped</u> <u>&lt;num&gt;</u> <u>blocks</u>
              After a dump read error, <b>restore</b> may have to resynchronize itself. This message lists  the  number
              of blocks that were skipped over.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Restore</b> exits with zero status on success. Tape errors are indicated with an exit code of 1.

       When  doing  a comparison of files from a dump, an exit code of 2 indicates that some files were modified
       or deleted since the dump was made.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       If the following environment variable exists it will be utilized by <b>restore</b>:

       <b>TAPE</b>   If no <b>-f</b> option was specified, <b>restore</b> will use the device specified via <b>TAPE</b> as the dump  device.
              <b>TAPE</b> may be of the form <u>tapename</u>, <u>host:tapename</u> or <u>user@host:tapename</u>.

       <b>TMPDIR</b> The directory given in <b>TMPDIR</b> will be used instead of <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> to store temporary files.

       <b>RMT</b>    The environment variable <b>RMT</b> will be used to determine the pathname of the remote <b><a href="../man8/rmt.8.html">rmt</a></b>(8) program.

       <b>RSH</b>    <b>Restore</b>  uses  the  contents of this variable to determine the name of the remote shell command to
              use when doing a network restore (rsh, ssh etc.). If this variable is not  set,  <b><a href="../man3/rcmd.3.html">rcmd</a></b>(3)  will  be
              used, but only root will be able to do a network restore.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/dev/st0</u>
              the default tape drive

       <u>/tmp/rstdir*</u>
              file containing directories on the tape

       <u>/tmp/rstmode*</u>
              owner, mode, and time stamps for directories

       <u>./restoresymtable</u>
              information passed between incremental restores

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Restore</b>  can  get  confused  when  doing  incremental  restores  from dumps that were made on active file
       systems.

       A level 0 dump must be done after a full restore. Because <b>restore</b> runs in user code, it  has  no  control
       over  inode  allocation; thus a full dump must be done to get a new set of directories reflecting the new
       inode numbering, even though the content of the files is unchanged.

       The temporary files <u>/tmp/rstdir*</u> and <u>/tmp/rstmode*</u> are generated with a unique name based on the date  of
       the  dump  and  the  process  ID  (see <b><a href="../man3/mktemp.3.html">mktemp</a></b>(3)<b>),</b> except when <b>-r</b> or <b>-R</b> is used. Because <b>-R</b> allows you to
       restart a <b>-r</b> operation that may have been interrupted, the temporary files  should  be  the  same  across
       different  processes.  In  all  other  cases,  the  files  are  unique because it is possible to have two
       different dumps started at the same time, and separate operations shouldn't conflict with each other.

       To do a network restore, you have to run <b>restore</b> as root or use  a  remote  shell  replacement  (see  <b>RSH</b>
       variable).  This is due to the previous security history of <b>dump</b> and <b>restore</b>.  ( <b>restore</b> is written to be
       setuid root, but we are not certain all bugs are gone from the code - run setuid at your own risk.)

       At  the  end  of  restores  in <b>-i</b> or <b>-x</b> modes (unless <b>-o</b> option is in use), <b>restore</b> will ask the operator
       whether to set the permissions on the current directory.  If  the  operator  confirms  this  action,  the
       permissions  on  the directory from where <b>restore</b> was launched will be replaced by the permissions on the
       dumped root inode. Although this behaviour is not really a bug, it has proven itself to be confusing  for
       many  users, so it is recommended to answer 'no', unless you're performing a full restore and you do want
       to restore the permissions on '/'.

       It should be underlined that because it runs in user code, <b>restore</b> , when run with the  <b>-C</b>  option,  sees
       the  files  as  the  kernel  presents  them,  whereas  <b>dump</b>  sees all the files on a given filesystem. In
       particular, this can cause some confusion when comparing a dumped filesystem a part of which is hidden by
       a filesystem mounted on top of it.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>dump/restore</b>  backup  suite  was  ported  to  Linux's  Second  Extended  File  System  by  Remy  Card
       &lt;<a href="mailto:card@Linux.EU.Org">card@Linux.EU.Org</a>&gt;.  He  maintained  the  initial  versions of <b>dump</b> (up and including 0.4b4, released in
       January 1997).

       Starting with 0.4b5, the new maintainer is Stelian Pop &lt;<a href="mailto:stelian@popies.net">stelian@popies.net</a>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>dump/restore</b> backup suite is available from &lt;https://dump.sourceforge.io&gt;

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>restore</b> command appeared in 4.2BSD.

BSD                                       version 0.4b49 of 30 Nov 2024                               <u><a href="../man8/RESTORE.8.html">RESTORE</a></u>(8)
