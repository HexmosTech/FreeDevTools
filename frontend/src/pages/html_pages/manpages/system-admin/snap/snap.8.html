</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       snap - Tool to interact with snaps

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>snap</b> [OPTIONS]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  snap  command  lets  you install, configure, refresh and remove snaps.  Snaps are packages that work
       across many different Linux distributions, enabling secure delivery and operation of the latest apps  and
       utilities.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>abort</b>
       Abort a pending change

       The <u>abort</u> command attempts to abort a change that still has pending tasks.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] abort [abort-OPTIONS]

       <b>--last</b> Select  last  change of given type (install, refresh, remove, try, auto-refresh, etc.). A question
              mark at the end of the type means to do nothing (instead of returning an error) if  no  change  of
              the given type is found. Note the question mark could need protecting from the shell.

   <b>ack</b>
       Add an assertion to the system

       The <u>ack</u> command tries to add an assertion to the system assertion database.

       The assertion may also be a newer revision of a pre-existing assertion that it will replace.

       To  succeed the assertion must be valid, its signature verified with a known public key and the assertion
       consistent with and its prerequisite in the database.

   <b>alias</b>
       Set up a manual alias

       The <u>alias</u> command aliases the given snap application to the given alias.

       Once this manual alias is setup the respective application command can be invoked just using the alias.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] alias [alias-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

   <b>aliases</b>
       List aliases in the system

       The <u>aliases</u> command lists all aliases available in the system and their status.

       $ snap aliases &lt;snap&gt;

       Lists only the aliases defined by the specified snap.

   <b>changes</b>
       List system changes

       The <u>changes</u> command displays a summary of system changes performed recently.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] changes [changes-OPTIONS]

       <b>--abs-time</b>
              Display absolute times (in RFC 3339 format). Otherwise, display relative times up to 60 days, then
              YYYY-MM-DD.

   <b>check-snapshot</b>
       Check a snapshot

       The <u>check-snapshot</u> command verifies the user, system and configuration data of the snaps included in  the
       specified snapshot.

       The  check  operation  runs  the  same  data  integrity verification that is performed when a snapshot is
       restored.

       By default, this command checks all the data in a snapshot.  Alternatively, you can specify the  data  of
       which snaps to check, or for which users, or a combination of these.

       If a snap is included in a check-snapshot operation, excluding its system and configuration data from the
       check is not currently possible. This restriction may be lifted in the future.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] check-snapshot [check-snapshot-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

       <b>--users</b>
              Check data of only specific users (comma-separated) (default: all users)

   <b>components</b>
       List available and installed components for installed snaps

       The  <u>components</u> command displays a summary of the components that are installed and available for the set
       of currently installed snaps.

       Components for specific installed snaps can be queried by providing snap names as positional arguments.

   <b>connect</b>
       Connect a plug to a slot

       The <u>connect</u> command connects a plug to a slot.  It may be called in the following ways:

       $ snap connect &lt;snap&gt;:&lt;plug&gt; &lt;snap&gt;:&lt;slot&gt;

       Connects the provided plug to the given slot.

       $ snap connect &lt;snap&gt;:&lt;plug&gt; &lt;snap&gt;

       Connects the specific plug to the only slot in the provided snap that matches the connected interface. If
       more than one potential slot exists, the command fails.

       $ snap connect &lt;snap&gt;:&lt;plug&gt;

       Connects the provided plug to the slot in the core snap with a name matching the plug name.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] connect [connect-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

   <b>connections</b>
       List interface connections

       The <u>connections</u> command lists connections between plugs and slots in the system.

       Unless &lt;snap&gt; is provided, the listing is for connected plugs and slots for all snaps in the  system.  In
       this mode, pass --all to also list unconnected plugs and slots.

       $ snap connections &lt;snap&gt;

       Lists connected and unconnected plugs and slots for the specified snap.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] connections [connections-OPTIONS]

       <b>--all</b>  Show connected and unconnected plugs and slots

   <b>create-cohort</b>
       Create cohort keys for a set of snaps

       The <u>create-cohort</u> command creates a set of cohort keys for a given set of snaps.

       A  cohort  is a view or snapshot of a snap's "channel map" at a given point in time that fixes the set of
       revisions for the snap given other constraints  (e.g.  channel  or  architecture).  The  cohort  is  then
       identified  by  an  opaque per-snap key that works across systems. Installations or refreshes of the snap
       using a given cohort key would use a fixed revision for up to 90 days, after which a new set of revisions
       would be fixed under that same cohort key and a new 90 days window started.

   <b>debug</b>
       Run debug commands

       The debug command contains a selection of additional sub-commands.

       Debug commands can be removed without notice and may not work on non-development systems.

   <b>debug</b> <b>api</b>
       Execute raw query to snapd API

       Execute a raw query to snapd API. Complex input can be read  from  stdin,  while  output  is  printed  to

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] debug timings [timings-OPTIONS]

       <b>--last</b> Select  last  change of given type (install, refresh, remove, try, auto-refresh, etc.). A question
              mark at the end of the type means to do nothing (instead of returning an error) if  no  change  of
              the given type is found. Note the question mark could need protecting from the shell.

       <b>--ensure</b>
              Show  timings  for  a  change  related to the given Ensure activity (one of: auto-refresh, become-
              operational, refresh-catalogs, refresh-hints, seed)

       The <u>disable</u> command disables a snap. The binaries and services of the snap will no longer  be  available,
       but all the data is still available and the snap can easily be enabled again.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] disable [disable-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

   <b>disconnect</b>
       Disconnect a plug from a slot

       The <u>disconnect</u> command disconnects a plug from a slot.  It may be called in the following ways:

       $ snap disconnect &lt;snap&gt;:&lt;plug&gt; &lt;snap&gt;:&lt;slot&gt;

       Disconnects the specific plug from the specific slot.

       $ snap disconnect &lt;snap&gt;:&lt;slot or plug&gt;

       Disconnects everything from the provided plug or slot.  The snap name may be omitted for the core snap.

       When  an  automatic  connection is manually disconnected, its disconnected state is retained after a snap
       refresh. The --forget flag can  be  added  to  the  disconnect  command  to  reset  this  behaviour,  and
       consequently re-enable an automatic reconnection after a snap refresh.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] disconnect [disconnect-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

              Install from the stable channel

       <b>--revision</b>
              Download  the  given  revision  of  a  snap.  When downloading components, download the components
              associated with the given snap revision.

       <b>--basename</b>
              Use this basename for the snap, component, and assertion files (defaults to &lt;snap&gt;_&lt;revision&gt;)

       <b>--target-directory</b>
              Download to this directory (defaults to the current directory)

       <b>--only-components</b>
              Only download the given components, not the snap

       <b>--cohort</b>
              Download from the given cohort

   <b>enable</b>
       Enable a snap in the system

       The <u>enable</u> command enables a snap that was previously disabled.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] enable [enable-OPTIONS]

       Export a snapshot

       Export a snapshot to the given filename.

   <b>find</b>
       Find packages to install

       The <u>find</u> command queries the store for available packages.

       With the --private flag, which requires the user to be logged-in to the store (see 'snap help login'), it
       instead searches for private snaps that the user has developer access to, either directly or through  the
       store's collaboration feature.

       A  green check mark (given color and unicode support) after a publisher name indicates that the publisher
       has been verified.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] find [find-OPTIONS]

       <b>Aliases</b>: search

       <b>--private</b>
              Search private snaps.

       <b>--narrow</b>
              Only search for snaps in “stable”.

              Use a little bit of Unicode to improve legibility.

   <b>forget</b>
       Delete a snapshot

       The <u>forget</u> command deletes a snapshot. This operation can not be undone.

       A snapshot contains archives for the user, system and configuration data of each  snap  included  in  the
       snapshot.

       By  default, this command forgets all the data in a snapshot.  Alternatively, you can specify the data of
       which snaps to forget.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] forget [forget-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

   <b>get</b>
       Print configuration options

       The <u>get</u> command prints configuration options for the provided snap.

           $ snap get snap-name username
           frank

       If multiple option names are provided, the corresponding values are returned:

           $ snap get snap-name username password
           Key       Value
           username  frank
           password  ...

       Nested values may be retrieved via a dotted path:

           $ snap get snap-name author.name
           frank

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] get [get-OPTIONS]

       <b>-t</b>     Strict typing with nulls and quoted strings

       <b>-d</b>     Always return document, even with single key

       <b>-l</b>     Always return list, even with single key

   <b>help</b>
       Show help about a command

       The <u>help</u> command displays information about snap commands.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] help [help-OPTIONS]

       <b>--all</b>  Show a short summary of all commands

   <b>import-snapshot</b>
       Import a snapshot

       Import an exported snapshot set to the system. The snapshot is imported with a new snapshot ID and can be
       restored using the restore command.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] import-snapshot [import-snapshot-OPTIONS]

       <b>--abs-time</b>

   <b>info</b>
       Show detailed information about snaps

       The <u>info</u> command shows detailed information about snaps.

       The snaps can be specified by name or by path; names are  looked  for  both  in  the  store  and  in  the
       installed  snaps;  paths  can  refer  to  a  .snap file, or to a directory that contains an unpacked snap
       suitable for 'snap try' (an example of this would be the 'prime' directory snapcraft produces).

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] info [info-OPTIONS]

       <b>--color</b> &lt;default: <u>"auto"</u>&gt;
              Use a little bit of color to highlight some things.

       <b>--unicode</b> &lt;default: <u>"auto"</u>&gt;
              Use a little bit of Unicode to improve legibility.

       <b>--abs-time</b>
              Display absolute times (in RFC 3339 format). Otherwise, display relative times up to 60 days, then
              YYYY-MM-DD.

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Include more details on the snap (expanded notes, base, etc.)

   <b>install</b>
       Install snaps on the system

       The <u>install</u> command installs the named snaps on the system.

       To install multiple instances of the same snap, append an underscore and a unique  identifier  (for  each
       instance) to a snap's name.

       Parallel  instances  are  installed  with  --unaliased passed implicitly to avoid conflicts with existing
       installs. This behaviour can be altered by passing --prefer which will enable all aliases  of  the  given
       snap  in  preference  to  conflicting aliases of other snaps whose automatic aliases will be disabled and
       manual aliases will be removed.

       With no further options, the snaps are installed  tracking  the  stable  channel,  with  strict  security
       confinement. All available channels of a snap are listed in its 'snap info' output.

       When  --revision is used, a later refresh will typically undo the revision override, taking the snap back
       to the current revision of the channel it's tracking.

       Use --name to set the instance name when installing from snap file.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] install [install-OPTIONS]

       <b>--color</b> &lt;default: <u>"auto"</u>&gt;
              Use a little bit of color to highlight some things.

       <b>--attrs</b>
              Show interface attributes

       <b>--all</b>  Include unused interfaces

   <b>known</b>
       Show known assertions of the provided type

       The <u>known</u> command shows known assertions of the provided type.  If header=value pairs are provided  after
       the  assertion  type,  the  assertions  shown  must also have the specified headers matching the provided
       values.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] known [known-OPTIONS]

       <b>--remote</b>
              Query the store for the assertion, via snapd if possible

       <b>--direct</b>
              Query the store for the assertion, without attempting to go via snapd

   <b>list</b>
       List installed snaps

       The <u>list</u> command displays a summary of snaps installed in the current system.

       A green check mark (given color and unicode support) after a publisher name indicates that the  publisher
       has been verified.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] list [list-OPTIONS]

       <b>--all</b>  Show all revisions

       <b>--color</b> &lt;default: <u>"auto"</u>&gt;
              Use a little bit of color to highlight some things.

              Use a little bit of Unicode to improve legibility.

   <b>login</b>
       Authenticate to snapd and the store

       The  <u>login</u>  command  authenticates  the  user to snapd and the snap store, and saves credentials into the
       <a href="file:~/.snap/auth.json">~/.snap/auth.json</a> file. Further communication with snapd will then be made using those credentials.

       It's not necessary to log in to interact with snapd. Doing  so,  however,  enables  interactions  without
       sudo,  as well as some some developer-oriented features as detailed in the help for the find, install and
       refresh commands.

       An account can be set up at https://login.ubuntu.com

   <b>logout</b>
       Log out of snapd and the store

       The <u>logout</u> command logs the current user out of snapd and the store.

   <b>logs</b>
       Retrieve logs for services

       The <u>logs</u> command fetches logs of the given services and displays them in chronological order.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] logs [logs-OPTIONS]

       <b>--abs-time</b>
              Display absolute times (in RFC 3339 format). Otherwise, display relative times up to 60 days, then
              YYYY-MM-DD.

       <b>-n</b> &lt;default: <u>"10"</u>&gt;
              Show only the given number of lines, or 'all'.

       <b>-f</b>     Wait for new lines and print them as they come in.

   <b>model</b>
       Get the active model for this device

       The <u>model</u> command returns the active model assertion information for this device.

       By default, only the essential model identification information is included in the output, but  this  can
       be expanded to include all of an assertion's non-meta headers.

       The verbose output is presented in a structured, yaml-like format.

       Similarly, the active serial assertion can be used for the output instead of the model assertion.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] model [model-OPTIONS]

       <b>--abs-time</b>
              Display absolute times (in RFC 3339 format). Otherwise, display relative times up to 60 days, then
              YYYY-MM-DD.

       <b>--color</b> &lt;default: <u>"auto"</u>&gt;
              Use a little bit of color to highlight some things.

       <b>--unicode</b> &lt;default: <u>"auto"</u>&gt;
              Use a little bit of Unicode to improve legibility.

       <b>--serial</b>
              Print the serial assertion instead of the model assertion.

       <b>--verbose</b>

       <b>--assertion</b>
              Print the raw assertion.

   <b>okay</b>
       Acknowledge warnings

       The <u>okay</u> command acknowledges the warnings listed with 'snap warnings'.

       Once acknowledged a warning won't appear again unless it re-occurrs and sufficient time has passed.

   <b>pack</b>
       Pack the given directory as a snap

       The <u>pack</u> command packs the given snap-dir as a snap and writes the result to target-dir. If target-dir is
       omitted,  the  result is written to current directory. If both source-dir and target-dir are omitted, the
       pack command packs the current directory.

       The default file name for a snap can be derived entirely from its snap.yaml, but in some situations  it's
       simpler  for  a  script  to feed the filename in. In those cases, --filename can be given to override the
       default. If this filename is not absolute it will be taken as relative to target-dir.

       When used with --check-skeleton, pack only checks whether  snap-dir  contains  valid  snap  metadata  and
       raises  an  error  otherwise.  Application  commands  listed  in  snap  metadata file, but appearing with
       incorrect permission bits result in an error. Commands that are  missing  from  snap-dir  are  listed  in
       diagnostic messages.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] pack [pack-OPTIONS]

       <b>--check-skeleton</b>
              Validate snap-dir metadata only

       <b>--filename</b>
              Output to this filename

       <b>--compression</b>
              Compression to use (e.g. xz or lzo)

   <b>prefer</b>
       Enable aliases from a snap, disabling any conflicting aliases

       The  <u>prefer</u>  command  enables all aliases of the given snap in preference to conflicting aliases of other
       snaps whose aliases will be disabled (or removed, for manual ones).

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] prefer [prefer-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

   <b>prepare-image</b>
       Prepare a device image

       The <u>prepare-image</u> command performs some of the steps necessary for creating device images.

       For core images it is not invoked directly but usually via ubuntu-image.

       For preparing classic images it supports a --classic mode

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] prepare-image [prepare-image-OPTIONS]

       <b>--classic</b>
              Enable classic mode to prepare a classic model image

       <b>--revisions</b>
              Specify  a  seeds.manifest file referencing the exact revisions of the provided snaps which should
              be installed

       <b>--write-revisions</b> [<u>="./seed.manifest"</u>]
              Writes a manifest file containing references to the exact snap revisions used  for  the  image.  A
              path for the manifest is optional.

   <b>quota</b>
       Show quota group for a set of snaps

       The <u>quota</u> command shows information about a quota group, including the set of snaps and any sub-groups it
       contains, as well as its resource constraints and the current usage of those constrained resources.

   <b>quotas</b>
       Show quota groups

       The <u>quotas</u> command shows all quota groups.

   <b>reboot</b>
       Reboot into selected system and mode

       The <u>reboot</u> command reboots the system into a particular mode of the selected recovery system.

       When called without a system label and without a mode it will just trigger a regular reboot.

       When  called without a label, the current system will be used for "run" mode. The default recovery system
       will be used for "recover", "factory-reset" and "install" modes.

       Note that the "run" mode is only available for the current system.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] reboot [reboot-OPTIONS]

       <b>--run</b>  Boot into run mode

       <b>--install</b>
              Boot into install mode

       <b>--recover</b>
              Boot into recover mode

              Boot into factory-reset mode

   <b>recovery</b>
       List available recovery systems

       The <u>recovery</u> command lists the available recovery systems.

       With --show-keys it displays recovery keys that can be used to unlock the  encrypted  partitions  if  the
       device-specific automatic unlocking does not work.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] recovery [recovery-OPTIONS]

       <b>--color</b> &lt;default: <u>"auto"</u>&gt;
              Use a little bit of color to highlight some things.

       <b>--unicode</b> &lt;default: <u>"auto"</u>&gt;
              Use a little bit of Unicode to improve legibility.

       <b>--show-keys</b>
              Show recovery keys (if available) to unlock encrypted partitions.

   <b>refresh</b>
       Refresh snaps in the system

       The <u>refresh</u> command updates the specified snaps, or all snaps in the system if none are specified.

       With no further options, the snaps are refreshed to the current revision of the channel they're tracking,
       preserving  their  confinement  options.  All  available channels of a snap are listed in its 'snap info'
       output.

       When --revision is used, a later refresh will typically undo the revision override.

       Hold (--hold) is used to postpone snap refresh updates for all snaps when no snaps are specified, or  for
       the specified snaps.

       When  no snaps are specified --hold is only effective on auto-refreshes and will not block either general
       refresh requests from 'snap refresh' or specific snap requests from 'snap refresh target-snap'.

       When snaps are specified --hold is effective on both their auto-refreshes and  general  refresh  requests
       from 'snap refresh'. However, specific snap requests from 'snap refresh target-snap' remain unblocked and
       will proceed.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] refresh [refresh-OPTIONS]

       <b>--color</b> &lt;default: <u>"auto"</u>&gt;
              Use a little bit of color to highlight some things.

       <b>--unhold</b>
              Remove refresh hold

   <b>remodel</b>
       Remodel this device

       The  <u>remodel</u>  command  changes  the model assertion of the device, either to a new revision or a full new
       model.

       In the process it applies any implied changes to the device: new required snaps,  new  kernel  or  gadget
       etc.

       Snaps  and  assertions are downloaded from the store unless they are provided as local files specified by
       --snap and --assertion options. If using these options, it is expected that  all  the  needed  snaps  and
       assertions are provided locally, otherwise the remodel will fail.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] remodel [remodel-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

       <b>--snap</b> Use one or more locally available snaps.

       <b>--assertion</b>
              Use one or more locally available assertion files.

       <b>--offline</b>
              Use  only  pre-installed  and  locally  provided  snaps  and  assertions.  Providing  any snaps or
              assertions locally implies --offline.

   <b>remove</b>
       Remove snaps from the system

       The <u>remove</u> command removes the named snap instance from the system.

       By default all the snap revisions are removed, including their data and the common data directory. When a
       --revision option is passed only the specified revision is removed.

       Unless automatic snapshots are disabled, a snapshot of all data for the snap is saved upon removal, which
       is then available for future restoration with snap restore. The  --purge  option  disables  automatically
       creating snapshots.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] remove [remove-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

              Terminate running processes associated with a snap before removal

   <b>remove-quota</b>
       Remove quota group

       The <u>remove-quota</u> command removes the given quota group.

       Currently,  only  quota  groups  with no sub-groups can be removed. In order to remove a quota group with
       sub-groups, the sub-groups must first be removed until there are no sub-groups for the  group,  then  the
       group itself can be removed.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] remove-quota [remove-quota-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>

   <b>restart</b>
       Restart services

       The <u>restart</u> command restarts the given services.

       If  the  --reload option is given, for each service whose app has a reload command, a reload is performed
       instead of a restart.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] restart [restart-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

       <b>--system</b>
              The operation should only affect system services.

       <b>--user</b> The operation should only affect user services for the current user.

       <b>--users</b>
              If provided and set to 'all', the operation should affect services for all users.

       <b>--reload</b>
              If the service has a reload command, use it instead of restarting.

   <b>restore</b>
       Restore a snapshot

       The <u>restore</u> command replaces the current user, system and configuration data of included snaps, with  the
       corresponding data from the specified snapshot.

       By default, this command restores all the data in a snapshot.  Alternatively, you can specify the data of
       which snaps to restore, or for which users, or a combination of these.

       If  a  snap  is  included  in  a  restore operation, excluding its system and configuration data from the
       restore is not currently possible. This restriction may be lifted in the future.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] restore [restore-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

       <b>--users</b>
              Restore data of only specific users (comma-separated) (default: all users)

   <b>revert</b>
       Reverts the given snap to the previous state

       The <u>revert</u> command reverts the given snap to its state before the latest refresh.  This  will  reactivate
       the  previous  snap  revision,  and  will  use  the original data that was associated with that revision,
       discarding any data changes that were done by the latest revision. As an exception, data which  the  snap
       explicitly chooses to share across revisions is not touched by the revert process.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] revert [revert-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

       <b>--strace</b> [<u>="with-strace"</u>] &lt;default: <u>"no-strace"</u>&gt;
              Run the command under strace (useful for debugging). Extra strace options can be specified as well
              here. Pass --raw to strace early snap helpers.

       <b>--gdbserver</b> [<u>=":0"</u>] &lt;default: <u>"no-gdbserver"</u>&gt;
              Run the command with gdbserver

       <b>--trace-exec</b>
              Display exec calls timing data

   <b>save</b>
       Save a snapshot of the current data

       The  <u>save</u>  command  creates  a  snapshot of the current user, system and configuration data for the given
       snaps.

       By default, this command saves the data of all snaps for all users.  Alternatively, you can  specify  the
       data of which snaps to save, or for which users, or a combination of these.

       If  a snap is included in a save operation, excluding its system and configuration data from the snapshot
       is not currently possible. This restriction may be lifted in the future.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] save [save-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

       <b>--abs-time</b>
              Display absolute times (in RFC 3339 format). Otherwise, display short relative times.

       <b>--id</b>   Show only a specific snapshot.

   <b>services</b>
       Query the status of services

       The <u>services</u> command lists information about the  services  specified,  or  about  the  services  in  all
       currently installed snaps.

       If  executed as root user, the 'Startup' column of any user service will be whether it's globally enabled
       (i.e systemctl is-enabled). To view the actual 'Startup'|'Current' status of the user  services  for  the
       root user itself, --user can be provided.

       If  executed  as  a  non-root  user,  the 'Startup'|'Current' status of user services will be the current
       status for the invoking user. To view the global enablement status of  user  services,  --global  can  be
       provided.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] services [services-OPTIONS]

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--global</b>
              Show the global enable status for user services instead of the status for the current user.

              Show the current status of the user services instead of the global enable status.

   <b>set</b>
       Change configuration options

       The <u>set</u> command changes the provided configuration options as requested.

           $ snap set snap-name username=frank password=$PASSWORD

       All  configuration  changes  are  persisted at once, and only after the snap's configuration hook returns
       successfully.

       Nested values may be modified via a dotted path:

           $ snap set snap-name author.name=frank

       Configuration option may be unset with exclamation mark:
           $ snap set snap-name author!

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] set [set-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

       <b>-t</b>     Parse the value strictly as JSON document

       <b>-s</b>     Parse the value as a string

   <b>set-quota</b>
       Create or update a quota group.

       The <u>set-quota</u> command updates or creates a quota group with the specified set of snaps.

       A quota group sets resource limits on the set of snaps or snap services it contains.   Snaps  can  be  at
       most  in  one  quota  group  but  quota  groups  can  be  nested.  Nested quota groups are subject to the
       restriction that the total sum of each existing quota in sub-groups cannot  exceed  that  of  the  parent
       group the nested groups are part of.

       All  provided snaps are appended to the group; to remove a snap from a quota group, the entire group must
       be removed with remove-quota and recreated without the snap. To remove a sub-group from the quota  group,
       the sub-group must be removed directly with the remove-quota command.

       To set limits on individual services, one or more services can be placed into a sub-group. The respective
       snap  for  each  service must belong to the sub-group's parent group. These sub-groups will have the same
       limitations as nested groups which means their combined resource usage cannot exceed the resource  limits
       set for the parent group. Sub-groups which contain services cannot have their own journal quotas set, and
       instead automatically inherit any journal quota their parent quota group may have.

       The memory limit for a quota group can be increased but not decreased. To decrease the memory limit for a
       quota  group,  the  entire group must be removed with the remove-quota command and recreated with a lower
       limit. Increasing the memory limit for a quota group does not restart any services associated with  snaps
       in the quota group.

       The CPU limit for a quota group can be both increased and decreased after being set on a quota group. The
       CPU  limit can be specified as a single percentage which means that the quota group is allowed an overall
       percentage of the CPU resources. Setting it to 50% means that the quota group is allowed to use up to 50%
       of all CPU cores in the allowed CPU set. Setting the percentage to 2x100% means that the quota  group  is
       allowed up to 100% on two cpu cores.

       The  CPU set limit for a quota group can be modified to include new cpus, or to remove existing cpus from
       the quota already set.

       The threads limit for a quota group can be increased but not decreased. To decrease the threads limit for
       a quota group, the entire group must be removed with the remove-quota command and recreated with a  lower
       limit.

       The  journal  limits  can be increased and decreased after being set on a group.  Setting a journal limit
       will cause the snaps in the group to be put into  the  same  journal  namespace.  This  will  affect  the
       behaviour of the log command.

       New quotas can be set on existing quota groups, but existing quotas cannot be removed from a quota group,
       without removing and recreating the entire group.

       Adding new snaps to a quota group will result in all non-disabled services in that snap being restarted.

       An existing sub group cannot be moved from one parent to another.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] tasks [tasks-OPTIONS]

       <b>Aliases</b>: change

       <b>--abs-time</b>
              Display absolute times (in RFC 3339 format). Otherwise, display relative times up to 60 days, then
              YYYY-MM-DD.

       <b>--last</b> Select last change of given type (install, refresh, remove, try, auto-refresh, etc.).  A  question
              mark  at  the  end of the type means to do nothing (instead of returning an error) if no change of
              the given type is found. Note the question mark could need protecting from the shell.

   <b>try</b>
       Test an unpacked snap in the system

       The <u>try</u> command installs an unpacked snap into the  system  for  testing  purposes.   The  unpacked  snap
       content  continues  to  be used even after installation, so non-metadata changes there go live instantly.
       Metadata changes such as those performed in snap.yaml will require reinstallation to go live.

       If snap-dir argument is omitted, the try command will attempt to infer it if either  snapcraft.yaml  file
       and prime directory or meta/snap.yaml file can be found relative to current working directory.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] try [try-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

       <b>--devmode</b>
              Put snap in development mode and disable security confinement

       <b>--jailmode</b>
              Put snap in enforced confinement mode

       <b>--classic</b>
              Put snap in classic mode and disable security confinement

   <b>unalias</b>
       Remove a manual alias, or the aliases for an entire snap

       The  <u>unalias</u>  command  removes a single alias if the provided argument is a manual alias, or disables all
       aliases of a snap, including manual ones, if the argument is a snap name.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] unalias [unalias-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

   <b>unset</b>
       Remove configuration options

       The <u>unset</u> command removes the provided configuration options as requested.

            $ snap unset snap-name name address

       All configuration changes are persisted at once, and only after the  snap's  configuration  hook  returns
       successfully.

       Nested values may be removed via a dotted path:

            $ snap unset snap-name user.name

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] unset [unset-OPTIONS]

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

   <b>validate</b>
       List or apply validation sets

       The <u>validate</u> command lists or applies validation sets that state which snaps are required or permitted to
       be installed together, optionally constrained to fixed revisions.

       A  validation  set can either be in monitoring mode, in which case its constraints aren't enforced, or in
       enforcing mode, in which case snapd will not allow operations which would result in  snaps  breaking  the
       validation set's constraints.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] validate [validate-OPTIONS]

       <b>--monitor</b>
              Monitor the given validations set

       <b>--enforce</b>
              Enforce the given validation set

       <b>--forget</b>
              Forget the given validation set

       <b>--refresh</b>
              Refresh or install snaps to satisfy enforced validation sets

       <b>--color</b> &lt;default: <u>"auto"</u>&gt;
              Use a little bit of color to highlight some things.

       <b>--unicode</b> &lt;default: <u>"auto"</u>&gt;
              Use a little bit of Unicode to improve legibility.

       <b>--no-wait</b>
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

   <b>version</b>
       Show version details

       The <u>version</u> command displays the versions of the running client, server, and operating system.

   <b>wait</b>
       Wait for configuration

       The <u>wait</u> command waits until a configuration becomes true.

   <b>warnings</b>
       List warnings

       The <u>warnings</u> command lists the warnings that have been reported to the system.

       Once  warnings  have been listed with 'snap warnings', 'snap okay' may be used to silence them. A warning
       that's been silenced in this way will not be listed again unless it happens again, _and_ a cooldown  time
       has passed.

       Warnings expire automatically, and once expired they are forgotten.

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] warnings [warnings-OPTIONS]

       <b>--abs-time</b>
              Display absolute times (in RFC 3339 format). Otherwise, display relative times up to 60 days, then
              YYYY-MM-DD.

       <b>--unicode</b> &lt;default: <u>"auto"</u>&gt;
              Use a little bit of Unicode to improve legibility.

       <b>--all</b>  Show all warnings

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Show more information

   <b>watch</b>
       Watch a change in progress

       The <u>watch</u> command waits for the given change-id to finish and shows progress (if available).

       <b>Usage</b>: snap [OPTIONS] watch [watch-OPTIONS]

       <b>--last</b> Select  last  change of given type (install, refresh, remove, try, auto-refresh, etc.). A question
              mark at the end of the type means to do nothing (instead of returning an error) if  no  change  of
              the given type is found. Note the question mark could need protecting from the shell.

   <b>whoami</b>
       Show the email the user is logged in with

       The <u>whoami</u> command shows the email the user is logged in with.
