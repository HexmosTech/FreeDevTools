</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tcsd - daemon that manages Trusted Computing resources

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcsd</b> [<b>-f</b>] [<b>-e</b>] [<b>-c</b> <b>&lt;configfile&gt;</b> <b>]</b> [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Trousers is an open-source TCG Software Stack (TSS), released under the BSD License. Trousers aims to be
       compliant with the current (1.1b) and upcoming (1.2) TSS specifications available from the Trusted
       Computing Group website: <a href="http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org">http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org</a>.

       <b>tcsd</b> is a user space daemon that should be (according to the TSS spec) the only portal to the TPM device
       driver. At boot time, <b>tcsd</b> should be started, it should open the TPM device driver and from that point
       on, all requests to the TPM should go through the TSS stack. The <b>tcsd</b> manages TPM resources and handles
       requests from TSP's both local and remote.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--foreground</b>
              run the daemon in the foreground

       <b>-e</b>     attempt to connect to software TPMs over TCP

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--config</b> <b>&lt;configfile&gt;</b>
              use the provided configuration file rather than the default configuration file

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              display help message

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  two  types of access control for the <b>tcsd</b>, access to the daemon's socket itself and access to
       specific commands internal to the <b>tcsd</b>. Access to the <b>tcsd</b>'s port should  be  controlled  by  the  system
       administrator  using  firewall  rules.   If using iptables, the following rule will allow a specific host
       access to the tcsd:

       # iptables -A INPUT -s $IP_ADDRESS -p tcp --destination-port 30003 -j ACCEPT

       Access to individual commands internal to the  tcsd  is  configured  by  the  <b>tcsd</b>  configuration  file's
       "remote_ops" directive. Each function call in the TCS API is reachable by a unique ordinal.  Each labeled
       "remote  op"  actually  defines  a  set  of  ordinals (usually more than one) necessary to accomplish the
       operation. So, for example, the "random" operation  enables  the  ordinals  for  opening  and  closing  a
       context,  calling  TCS_StirRandom  and  TCS_GetRandom, as well as TCS_FreeMemory. By default, connections
       from localhost will allow any ordinals.

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       TSS applications have access to 2 different kinds of 'persistent' storage. 'User' persistent storage  has
       the  lifetime  of  that of the application using it and therefore is destroyed when an application exits.
       User PS is controlled by the TSP of the application.  'System' persistent storage is  controlled  by  the
       TCS  and  stays  valid  across application lifetimes, <b>tcsd</b> restarts and system resets. Data registered in
       system PS stays valid until an application requests that it be removed. User  PS  files  are  by  default
       stored  as  /var/tpm/user.{pid} and the system PS file by default is /var/tpm/system.data.  The system PS
       file is initially created when ownership of the TPM is first taken.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcsd</b> configuration is stored by default in /etc/tcsd.conf

</pre><h4><b>DEBUG</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       If TrouSerS has been compiled with debugging enabled, the debugging output can be  supressed  by  setting
       the TSS_DEBUG_OFF environment variable.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>DRIVERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcsd</b>    is    compatible    with    the    IBM    Research    TPM    device    driver    available   from
       <a href="http://ibmswtpm.sourceforge.net/">http://ibmswtpm.sourceforge.net/</a> and the TPM device driver available  from  <a href="http://sf.net/projects/tpmdd">http://sf.net/projects/tpmdd</a>,
       which is also available in the upstream Linux kernel and many Linux distros.

</pre><h4><b>CONFORMING</b> <b>TO</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcsd</b> conforms to the Trusted Computing Group Software Specification version 1.1 Golden
