       sg_persist - use SCSI PERSISTENT RESERVE command to access registrations and reservations

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sg_persist</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>DEVICE</u>

       <b>sg_persist</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>--device=DEVICE</u>

       <b>sg_persist</b> <u>--help</u> | <u>--version</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  utility  allows  Persistent  reservations  and  registrations to be queried and changed. Persistent
       reservations and registrations are queried by sub-commands (called "service actions"  in  SPC-4)  of  the
       SCSI  PERSISTENT  RESERVE  IN  (PRIN)  command.  Persistent reservations and registrations are changed by
       sub-commands of the SCSI PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT (PROUT) command.

       There is a two stage process to obtain a persistent reservation. First an application (an  I_T  nexus  in
       the standard's jargon) must register a reservation key. If that is accepted (and it should be unless some
       other I_T nexus has registered that key) then the application can try and reserve the device. The reserve
       operation must specify the reservation key and a "type" (see the <u>--prout-type=TYPE</u> option).

       It  is  relatively  safe to query the state of Persistent reservations and registrations. With no options
       this utility defaults to the READ KEYS sub-command of the PRIN command. Other PRIN sub-commands are  READ
       RESERVATION, REPORT CAPABILITIES and READ FULL STATUS.

       Before  trying to change Persistent reservations and registrations users should be aware of what they are
       doing. The relevant sections of the SCSI Primary Commands document (i.e. SPC-5 ANSI INCITS 502-2020)  are
       sections  8.14  (titled "Reservations"), 9.16 (for the PRIN command) and 9.17 (for the PROUT command). To
       safeguard against accidental use, the  <u>--out</u>  option  must  be  given  when  a  PROUT  sub-command  (e.g.
       <u>--register</u>) is used.

       The  older  SCSI  RESERVE  and  RELEASE  commands (both 6 and 10 byte variants) are not supported by this
       utility. In SPC-3, RESERVE and RELEASE are deprecated, replaced by Persistent Reservations.  RESERVE  and
       RELEASE  have  been  removed  from  SPC-4  and  Annex  B is provided showing how to convert to persistent
       reservation commands. See a utility called  'scsires'  for  support  of  the  SCSI  RESERVE  and  RELEASE
       commands.

       <u>DEVICE</u> needs to be specified for all variants of this utility apart from <u>--help</u> and <u>--version</u>. The <u>DEVICE</u>
       can  be  given  either  as  an  argument (typically but not necessarily following the options) or via the
       <u>--device=DEVICE</u> option.

       SPC-4 does not use the term "sub-command". It uses the term "service action" for this and for part  of  a
       field's  name  in the parameter block associated with the PROUT command (i.e. "service action reservation
       key"). To lessen the potential confusion the term "sub-command" has been introduced.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.  The following options are  sorted  in
       alphabetical order, based on their long option name.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--alloc-length</b>=<u>LEN</u>
              specify  the  allocation length of the PRIN command. <u>LEN</u> is a hex value.  By default this value is
              set to the size of the data-in buffer (8192).  This parameter is  of  use  for  verification  that
              response to PRIN commands with various allocation lengths is per section 4.3.5.6 of SPC-4 revision
              18.  Valid <u>LEN</u> values are 0-8192.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--clear</b>
              Clear  is  a sub-command of the PROUT command. It releases the persistent reservation (if any) and
              clears all registrations from the device. It is required to  supply  a  reservation  key  that  is
              registered for this I_T_L nexus (identified by <u>--param-rk=RK</u>).
              This  option  issues  the PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT SCSI command with its service action field set to
              CLEAR [0x3].

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--device</b>=<u>DEVICE</u>
              <u>DEVICE</u> to send SCSI commands to. The <u>DEVICE</u> can either be  provided  via  this  option  or  via  a
              freestanding  argument.  For  example,  these  two: 'sg_persist --device=/dev/sg2' and 'sg_persist
              /dev/sg2' are equivalent.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              output a usage message showing main options. Use twice (e.g. '-hh') for the other option and  more
              help.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b>
              the  response to a valid PRIN sub-command will be output in hexadecimal.  By default (i.e. without
              this option) if the PRIN sub-command is recognised then the response will be decoded as per SPC-4.
              May be used more than once for more hex and less text.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--in</b>
              specify that a SCSI PERSISTENT RESERVE IN command is required. This is the default.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--maxlen</b>=<u>LEN</u>
              <u>LEN</u> is used as the ALLOCATION LENGTH field of the PRIN command.   <u>LEN</u>  is  by  default  a  decimal
              value.  To give a hex value use a '0x' or '0X' prefix, or use a 'h' (or 'H') suffix. Can also take
              multipliers, see <u>--maxlen=LEN</u> option in the sg3_utils manual page.
              This option is the same as <u>--alloc-length=LEN</u> option apart from the  representation  of  <u>LEN</u>.  The
              option defaults to decimal while <u>--alloc-length=LEN</u> only takes hex.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-inquiry</b>
              the  default action is to do a standard SCSI INQUIRY command and output make, product and revision
              strings plus the peripheral device type prior to executing a PRIN  or  PROUT  command.  With  this
              option the INQUIRY command is skipped.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--out</b>
              specify that a SCSI PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT command is required.

       <b>-Y</b>, <b>--param-alltgpt</b>
              set  the  'all  target  ports'  (ALL_TG_PT) flag in the parameter block of the PROUT command. Only
              relevant for 'register' and 'register and ignore existing key' sub-commands.

       <b>-Z</b>, <b>--param-aptpl</b>
              set the 'activate persist through power loss' (APTPL) flag in the parameter  block  of  the  PROUT
              command.  Relevant  for  'register',  'register  and  ignore existing key' and 'register and move'
              sub-commands.

       <b>-K</b>, <b>--param-rk</b>=<u>RK</u>
              specify the reservation key found in the parameter block of the PROUT command. <u>RK</u> is assumed to be
              hex (up to 8 bytes long). Default value is 0. This option is needed by most PROUT sub-commands.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--param-sark</b>=<u>SARK</u>
              specify the service action reservation key found in the parameter block of the PROUT command. <u>SARK</u>
              is assumed to be hex (up to 8 bytes long).  Default value is 0. This  option  is  needed  by  some
              PROUT sub-commands.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--preempt</b>
              Preempt  is  a  sub-command  of  the  PROUT  command. Preempts the existing persistent reservation
              (identified by <u>--param-sark=SARK</u>) with the registration key that  is  registered  for  this  I_T_L
              nexus  (identified  by  <u>--param-rk=RK</u>).  If  a  new  reservation is established as a result of the
              preemption then the supplied <u>--prout-type=TYPE</u> is used as the type for this new reservation.
              This option issues the PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT SCSI command with its service action  field  set  to
              PREEMPT [0x4].

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--preempt-abort</b>
              Preempt  and  Abort  is  a  sub-command  of  the  PROUT  command. Preempts the existing persistent
              reservation (identified by <u>--param-sark=SARK</u>) with the registration key  that  is  registered  for
              this I_T_L nexus (identified by <u>--param-rk=RK</u>). If a new reservation is established as a result of
              the  preemption  then the supplied <u>--prout-type=TYPE</u> is used as the type for this new reservation.
              ACA and other pending tasks are aborted.
              This option issues the PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT SCSI command with its service action  field  set  to
              PREEMPT AND ABORT [0x5].

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--prout-type</b>=<u>TYPE</u>
              specify the PROUT command's 'type' argument. Required by the 'register-move', 'reserve', 'release'
              and  'preempt  (and  abort)'  sub-commands.  Valid <u>TYPE</u> values: 1-&gt; write exclusive, 3-&gt; exclusive
              access, 5-&gt; write exclusive - registrants only, 6-&gt; exclusive access - registrants only, 7-&gt; write
              exclusive - all registrants, 8-&gt; exclusive access - all registrants. Default value is 0 (which  is
              an  invalid  type). Each "persistent reservation type" is explained in more detail in a subsection
              of that name in the read reservation section of  the  PRIN  command  (section  6.15.3.3  of  SPC-4
              revision 37).

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--read-full-status</b>
              Read  Full  Status is a sub-command of the PRIN command. For each registration with the given SCSI
              device, it lists the reservation key and associated information. TransportIDs, if supplied in  the
              response, are decoded.
              This  option  issues  the  PERSISTENT RESERVE IN SCSI command with its service action field set to
              READ FULL STATUS [0x3].

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--read-keys</b>
              Read Keys is a sub-command of the PRIN command. Lists all the reservation  keys  registered  (i.e.
              registrations)  with  the  given  SCSI  device.  This is the default sub-command for the SCSI PRIN
              command.
              This option issues the PERSISTENT RESERVE IN SCSI command with its service  action  field  set  to
              READ KEYS [0x0].

       <b>-y</b>, <b>--readonly</b>
              Open  <u>DEVICE</u>  read-only.  May be useful with PRIN commands if there are unwanted side effects with
              the default read-write open. When given twice is interpreted as forcing  a  read-write  open  thus
              overriding the SG_PERSIST_IN_RDONLY environment variable if present. See the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
              section for more.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--read-reservation</b>
              Read  Reservation  is a sub-command of the PRIN command. List information about the current holder
              of the reservation on the <u>DEVICE</u>.  If  there  is  no  current  reservation  this  will  be  noted.
              Information  about  the  current holder of the reservation includes its reservation key, scope and
              type.
              This option issues the PERSISTENT RESERVE IN SCSI command with its service  action  field  set  to
              READ RESERVATION [0x1].

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--read-status</b>
              same as <u>--read-full-status</u>.

       <b>-G</b>, <b>--register</b>
              Register is a sub-command of the PROUT command. It has 3 different actions depending on associated
              parameters.  a)  add a new registration with '--param-rk=0' and '--param-sark=&lt;new_rk&gt;'; b) Change
              an existing registration with '--param-rk=&lt;old_rk&gt;' and '--param-sark=&lt;new_rk&gt;'; or  c) Delete  an
              existing registration with '--param-rk=&lt;old_rk&gt;' and '--param-sark=0'.
              This  option  issues  the PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT SCSI command with its service action field set to
              REGISTER [0x0].

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--register-ignore</b>
              Register and Ignore Existing Key is a sub-command of the PROUT  command.   Similar  to  <u>--register</u>
              except   that   when   changing   a   reservation   key   the   old  key  is  not  specified.  The
              '--param-sark=&lt;new_rk&gt;' option should also be given.
              This option issues the PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT SCSI command with its service action  field  set  to
              REGISTER AND IGNORE EXISTING KEY [0x6].

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--register-move</b>
              register (another initiator) and move (the reservation held by the current initiator to that other
              initiator)  is  a  sub-command  of  the  PROUT  command.  It requires the transportID of the other
              initiator. [The standard uses the term I_T nexus but the point to stress is  that  there  are  two
              initiators  (the  one  sending  this  command  and  another  one) but only one logical unit.]  The
              <u>--prout-type=TYPE</u> and <u>--param-rk=RK</u> options need to match that of the existing  reservation  while
              <u>--param-sark=SARK</u> option specifies the reservation key of the new (i.e. destination) registration.
              This  option  issues  the PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT SCSI command with its service action field set to
              REGISTER AND MOVE [0x7].

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--relative-target-port</b>=<u>RTPI</u>
              relative target port identifier that reservation is to be moved to by PROUT  'register  and  move'
              sub-command. <u>RTPI</u> is assumed to be hex in the range 0 to ffff inclusive. Defaults to 0 .

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--release</b>
              Release is a sub-command of the PROUT command. It releases the current persistent reservation. The
              <u>--prout-type=TYPE</u> and <u>--param-rk=RK</u> options, matching the reservation, must also be specified.
              This  option  issues  the PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT SCSI command with its service action field set to
              RELEASE [0x2].

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--replace-lost</b>
              Replace Lost Reservation is a sub-command of the PROUT command.  It "begins a recovery process for
              the lost persistent reservation that is managed by application clients". It also stops the  device
              server terminating commands due to a lost persistent reservation. Options should be '--param-rk=0'
              (or not given), '--param-sark=&lt;new_rk&gt;' and <u>--prout-type=TYPE</u>.
              This  option  issues  the PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT SCSI command with its service action field set to
              REPLACE LOST RESERVATION [0x8].

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--report-capabilities</b>
              Report Capabilities is a sub-command of the PRIN command. It lists information about  the  aspects
              of persistent reservations that the <u>DEVICE</u> supports.
              This  option  issues  the  PERSISTENT RESERVE IN SCSI command with its service action field set to
              REPORT CAPABILITIES [0x2].

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--reserve</b>
              Reserve is a sub-command of the PROUT  command.  It  creates  a  new  persistent  reservation  (if
              permitted). The <u>--prout-type=TYPE</u> and <u>--param-rk=RK</u> options must also be specified.
              This  option  issues  the PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT SCSI command with its service action field set to
              RESERVE [0x1].

       <b>-X</b>, <b>--transport-id</b>=<u>TIDS</u>
              The <u>TIDS</u> argument can take one of several forms. It can be a comma (or a single  space)  separated
              list of ASCII hex bytes representing a single TransportID as defined in SPC-5. They are usually 24
              bytes  long  apart  from  in  iSCSI.  The  <u>TIDS</u>  argument  may be a transport specific form ( e.g.
              "sas,5000c50005b32001"   is   clearer   than   an   equivalent   to    the    hex    byte    form:
              "6,0,0,0,5,0,c5,0,5,b3,20,1"). The <u>TIDS</u> argument may be "-" in which case one or more TransportIDs
              can  be  read  from stdin. The <u>TIDS</u> argument may be of the form "file=&lt;name&gt;" in which case one or
              more TransportIDs can be read from a file called &lt;name&gt;. See the "TRANSPORT IDs" section below for
              more information.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--unreg</b>
              optional when the PROUT register and move sub-command is invoked. If given it will unregister  the
              current  initiator  (I_T  nexus) after the other initiator has been registered and the reservation
              moved to it. When not given the  initiator  (I_T  nexus)  that  sent  the  PROUT  command  remains
              registered.
              This  option  issues  the PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT SCSI command with its service action field set to
              REGISTER AND MOVE [0x7]. The UNREG bit is set in the associated parameter list.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              print out cdb of issued commands prior to execution. If used twice prints out the parameter  block
              associated  with  the  PROUT  command prior to its execution as well. If used thrice decodes given
              transportID(s) as well. To see the response to a PRIN command in low  level  form  use  the  <u>--hex</u>
              option.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print out version string. Ignore all other parameters.

       <b>-?</b>     output usage message. Ignore all other parameters.

</pre><h4><b>TRANSPORT</b> <b>IDs</b></h4><pre>
       TransportIDs  are  used  in  persistent reservations to identify initiators.  The format of a TransportID
       differs depending on the type of transport being used. Their format  is  described  in  SPC-4  (in  draft
       revision 37 see section 7.6.4).

       A  TransportID  is  required  for  the  PROUT  'register  and  move' sub-command and the PROUT 'register'
       sub-command can have zero, one or more TransportIDs.

       When the <u>--transport-id=TIDS</u> option is given then the <u>TIDS</u> argument may be  a  comma  (or  single  space)
       separated  list of ASCII hex bytes that represent a single TransportID as defined in SPC-4. Alternatively
       the <u>TIDS</u> argument may be a transport specific string starting with either "fcp,", "spi,", "sbp,", "srp,",
       "iqn", "sas," or "sop,". The "iqn" form is an iSCSI qualified name. Apart from "iqn" the other  transport
       specific leadin string may be given in upper case (e.g. "FCP,").

       The "fcp," form should be followed by 16 ASCII hex digits that represent an initiator's N_PORT_NAME (e.g.
       "fcp,10000000C9F3A571").        The       "spi,"       form       should       be       followed       by
       "&lt;scsi_address&gt;,&lt;relative_target_port_identifier&gt;" (both decimal numbers).  The  "sbp,"  form  should  be
       followed  by  16  ASCII  hex  digits that represent an initiator's EUI-64 name. The "srp," form should be
       followed by 32 ASCII hex digits that represent an initiator port identifier.  The "sas," form  should  be
       followed   by   16   ASCII   hex   digits   that   represent   an  initiator's  port  SAS  address  (e.g.
       "sas,5000c50005b32001"). The "sop," form takes a hex number that represents a routing id.

       There are two iSCSI qualified name forms. The shorter form contains the iSCSI name of the initiator  port
       (e.g. "iqn.5886.com.acme.diskarrays-sn-a8675309"). The longer form adds the initiator session id (ISID in
       hex)  separated by ",i,0x".  For example "iqn.5886.com.acme.diskarrays-sn-a8675309,i,0x1234567890ab".  On
       the command line to stop punctuation in an iSCSI name being (mis)-interpreted by the shell,  putting  the
       option  argument  containing the iSCSI name in double quotes is advised. iSCSI names are encoded in UTF-8
       so if non (7 bit) ASCII characters appear  in  the  iSCSI  name  on  the  command  line,  there  will  be
       difficulties  if  they  are  not encoded in UTF-8. The locale can be changed temporarily by prefixing the
       command line invocation of sg_persist with "LANG=en_US.utf-8" for example.

       Alternatively the <u>TIDS</u> argument may specify a file (or pipe) from which one or more TransportIDs  may  be
       read.  If  the  <u>TIDS</u>  argument is "-" then stdin (standard input) is read. If the <u>TIDS</u> argument is of the
       form "file=&lt;name&gt;" then a file called &lt;name&gt; is read.  A  valid  SPC-4  TransportID  is  built  from  the
       transport specific string outlined in the previous paragraphs. The parsing of the data read is relatively
       simple. Empty lines are ignored. Everything from and including a "#" on a line is ignored. Leading spaces
       and tabs are ignored. There can be one transportID per line. The transportID can either be a comma, space
       or  tab  separated list of ASCII hex bytes that represent a TransportID as defined in SPC-4. Padding with
       zero bytes to a minimum length of 24 bytes is  performed  if  necessary.  The  transportID  may  also  be
       transport specific string type discussed above.

       In  SPC-3  the  SPEC_I_PT  bit set to one and TransportIDs were allowed for the PROUT register and ignore
       existing key sub-command. In SPC-4 that is disallowed yielding a CHECK CONDITION status with and  ILLEGAL
       REQUEST sense key and an additional sense code set to INVALID FIELD IN PARAMETER LIST.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  2.4 series of Linux kernels the <u>DEVICE</u> must be a SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series any
       SCSI device name (e.g. /dev/sdc, /dev/st1m or  /dev/sg3)  can  be  specified.   For  example  "sg_persist
       --read-keys /dev/sdb" will work in the 2.6 series kernels.

       The  only  scope  for  PROUT  commands supported in the current draft of SPC-4 is "LU_SCOPE". Hence there
       seems to be no point in offering an option to set scope to another value.

       Most errors with the PROUT sub-commands (e.g. missing or mismatched <u>--prout-type=TYPE</u>) will result  in  a
       RESERVATION  CONFLICT  status.  This  can  be  a  bit  confusing when you know there is only one (active)
       initiator: the "conflict" is with the SPC standard, not another initiator.

       Some recent disks accept some PRIN and PROUT sub-commands when the media is stopped.  One  exception  was
       setting  the APTPL flag (with the <u>--param-aptpl</u> option) during a key register operation, it complained if
       the disk one stopped. The error indicated it wanted  the  disk  spun  up  and  when  that  happened,  the
       registration was successful.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       These examples use Linux device names. For suitable device names in other supported Operating Systems see
       the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

       Due  to the various option defaults the simplest example executes the 'read keys' sub-command of the PRIN
       command:

          sg_persist /dev/sdb

       This is the same as the following (long-winded) command:

          sg_persist --in --read-keys --device=/dev/sdb

       To read the current reservation either the '--read-reservation' form or the shorter '-r' can be used:

          sg_persist -r /dev/sdb

       To <b>register</b> the new reservation key 0x123abc the following could be used:

          sg_persist --out --register --param-sark=123abc /dev/sdb

       Given the above registration succeeds, to <b>reserve</b> the <u>DEVICE</u> (with type 'write exclusive') the  following
       could be used:

          sg_persist --out --reserve --param-rk=123abc
                     --prout-type=1 /dev/sdb

       To  <b>release</b>  the  reservation  the  following  can  be  given  (note that the --param-rk and --prout-type
       arguments must match those of the reservation):

          sg_persist --out --release --param-rk=123abc
                     --prout-type=1 /dev/sdb

       Finally to <b>unregister</b> a reservation key (and not effect other registrations which is what '--clear' would
       do) the command is a little surprising:

          sg_persist --out --register --param-rk=123abc /dev/sdb

       Now have a close look at the difference between the register and unregister examples above.

       An    example    file    that    is    suitably    formatted    to    pass     transportIDs     via     a
       '--transport-id=file=transport_ids.txt'  option  can  be  found  in  the  examples  sub-directory  of the
       sg3_utils package. There is also a simple test script called sg_persist_tst.sh in the same directory.

       The above sequence of commands was tested successfully on a Seagate Savvio 10K.3 disk and a 1200 SSD both
       of which have SAS interfaces.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_persist is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Currently there is one recognised environment variable: SG_PERSIST_IN_RDONLY.  If present and only  if  a
       PRIN  command  has been selected then the given <u>DEVICE</u> is opened read-only (e.g. in Unix that is with the
       O_RDONLY flag). See the <u>--readonly</u> option.
