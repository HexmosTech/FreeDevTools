</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       i2cdump - examine I2C registers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>i2cdump</b> [<b>-f</b>] [<b>-r</b> <b>first-last</b>] [<b>-y</b>] [<b>-a</b>] <u>i2cbus</u> <u>address</u> [<u>mode</u> [<u>bank</u> [<u>bankreg</u>]]]
       <b>i2cdump</b> <b>-V</b>
       <b>i2cdump</b> <b>-h</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       i2cdump is a small helper program to examine registers visible through the I2C bus.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-V</b>     Display the version and exit.

       <b>-h</b>     Display the help and exit.

       <b>-f</b>     Force access to the device even if it is already busy. By default, i2cdump will refuse to access a
              device which is already under the control of a kernel driver. Using this flag is dangerous, it can
              seriously  confuse  the  kernel  driver  in  question. It can also cause i2cdump to return invalid
              results. So use at your own risk and only if you know what you're doing.

       <b>-r</b> <b>first-last</b>
              Limit the range of registers being accessed. This option is not available with mode <b>s</b>. For mode <b>W</b>,
              <b>first</b> must be even and <b>last</b> must be odd.

       <b>-y</b>     Disable interactive mode. By default, i2cdump will wait for a confirmation from  the  user  before
              messing  with the I2C bus. When this flag is used, it will perform the operation directly. This is
              mainly meant to be used in scripts.

       <b>-a</b>     Allow using addresses between 0x00 - 0x07 and 0x78 - 0x7f. Not recommended.

       At least two options must be provided to i2cdump. <u>i2cbus</u> indicates the number or name of the I2C  bus  to
       be  scanned. This number should correspond to one of the busses listed by <u>i2cdetect</u> <u>-l</u>. <u>address</u> indicates
       the address to be scanned on that bus, and is an integer between 0x08 and 0x77.

       The <u>mode</u> parameter, if specified, is one of the letters <b>b</b>, <b>w</b>, or <b>i</b>, corresponding to a  read  size  of  a
       single  byte,  a  16-bit word, an I2C block, respectively. The <b>c</b> mode is a little different, it reads all
       bytes consecutively, and is useful for chips  that  have  an  address  auto-increment  feature,  such  as
       EEPROMs. The <b>W</b> mode is also special, it is similar to <b>w</b> except that a read command will only be issued on
       even register addresses; this is again mainly useful for EEPROMs.

       A  <b>p</b> can also be appended to the <u>mode</u> parameter (except for <b>i</b> and <b>W</b>) to enable PEC. If the <u>mode</u> parameter
       is omitted, i2cdump defaults to byte access without PEC.

       The <u>bank</u> and <u>bankreg</u> parameters are useful on the W83781D and similar chips (at the time of writing,  all
       Winbond  and Asus chips).  <u>bank</u> is an integer between 0 and 7, and <u>bankreg</u> is an integer between 0x00 and
       0xFF (default value: 0x4E). The W83781D data sheet has more information on bank selection.

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       i2cdump can be dangerous if used improperly. Most notably, the <b>c</b> mode starts with WRITING a byte  to  the
       chip. On most chips it will be stored in the address pointer register, which is OK, but some chips with a
       single  register  or no (visible) register at all will most likely see this as a real WRITE, resulting in
       possible misbehavior or corruption. Do not use i2cdump on random addresses. Anyway, it is of  little  use
       unless you have good knowledge of the chip you're working with and an idea of what you are looking for.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Dump  the  whole  contents  of  I2C device at 7-bit address 0x50 on bus 9 (i2c-9), using the default read
       method (byte mode), after user confirmation:
              # i2cdump 9 0x50

       Immediately dump the whole contents of I2C device at 7-bit address 0x50 on bus 9 (i2c-9), using I2C block
       read transactions (no user confirmation):
              # i2cdump -y 9 0x50 i
       If the device is an EEPROM, the output would typically be the same as output of the previous example.

       Dump registers 0x00 to 0x3f of the I2C device at 7-bit address 0x2d on bus 1 (i2c-1), using  the  default
       read method (byte mode), after user confirmation:
              # i2cdump -r 0x00-0x3f 1 0x2d

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       To report bugs or send fixes, please write to the Linux I2C mailing list &lt;<a href="mailto:linux-i2c@vger.kernel.org">linux-i2c@vger.kernel.org</a>&gt; with
       Cc to the current maintainer: Jean Delvare &lt;<a href="mailto:jdelvare@suse.de">jdelvare@suse.de</a>&gt;.

       SMBus block mode used to be supported by this tool.  Please use <u>i2cget</u> instead.
