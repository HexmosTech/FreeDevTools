       spost - feed a message to sendmail

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>spost</b> [<b>-verbose</b> | <b>-noverbose</b>] <u>file</u> [<b>-Version</b>] [<b>-help</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Spost</b>  is the program called by <b>send</b> to feed the message in <u>file</u> to <b>sendmail</b> for delivery.  In fact, many
       of the features attributed to <b>send</b> in its manual page are performed by  <b>spost</b>,  with  <b>send</b>  acting  as  a
       preprocessor.   Thus,  it  is  <b>spost</b>  which parses the various header fields, appends `From:' and `Date:'
       lines, and finally feeds the message to the MTA.  <b>Spost</b> will not normally be called directly by the user.

       <b>Spost</b> searches the `To:', `Cc:', `Bcc:', `Dcc:', `Fcc:', and `Resent-xxx:' header lines of the  specified
       message for destination addresses,

       <b>Spost</b> invokes <b>sendmail</b> with all recipients, except the blind ones (`Bcc:'), as command line arguments:
              <b>sendmail</b> <b>-i</b> [<b>-v</b>] <u>recipients</u> <u>...</u>

       If  a  `Bcc:' field is encountered, its addresses will be used for delivery, and the `Bcc:' field will be
       removed from the message sent  to  sighted  recipients.   The  blind  recipients  will  receive  a  newly
       constructed message with a copy of the original message attached.  MIME rules are used for encapsulation.
       (<b>spost</b> invokes <b>send</b> to send the Bcc message.)

       If a `Dcc:' field is encountered, the field will be removed before sending the message. The Dcc recipient
       will receive the message as well, but without being mentioned in the recipient headers.

       In  contrast to Bcc, the Dcc recipient receives the same original message as all the sighted reciepients,
       whereas the Bcc recipient receives a special, newly constructed  message,  which  contains  the  original
       message as an attachment.

       Bcc  is  probably  a  good  choice for a message with both sighted and invisible reciepients (e.g. inform
       someone privately about the message being sent). Dcc is probably a good choice for a message to  a  group
       of only invisible recipients (e.g. invite to a party).

       The  `Aliasfile'  profile  entry  can be used to specify one or more files that spost should take aliases
       from.

       Aliasing is done on any address field. Those are: `From:',  `To:',  `Cc:',  `Bcc:'  and  `Dcc:',  or  the
       `Resent-xxx:' versions of these fields.

       The  <b>-verbose</b>  switch  enables informational messages.  For example, the `-v' switch will be added to the
       <b>sendmail</b> invocation.

       If you specify a `From:' line manually in the message draft, it will be used as provided.  If there is no
       `From:' line in the draft, <b>spost</b>  uses  the  `<u>Default-From</u>'  profile  entry,  if  set.   Otherwise  <b>spost</b>
       constructs  the  `From:'  line  from  the user's login name and the full name from the GECOS field of the
       passwd file.  An example is `From: Dan Harkless &lt;dan&gt;'.

       If you set the <b>$SIGNATURE</b> environment variable.  Its value overrides the full name from the GECOS field.

       A `Sender:' header will be added in two cases.  First, if the `From:' line given in  the  draft  contains
       one  or  more  addresses, of which none is the user's own one, as defined by `<u>Alternate-Mailboxes</u>'.  (The
       sender address will then be determined equally  as  described  above  for  the  absent  `From:'  header.)
       Second, if the `From:' line contains multiple addresses, of which at least one is the user's own address.
       The first own address will be used as the sender address.

       Note that this applies equally to `Resent-From:' lines in messages sent with <b>dist</b>.

       <b>Spost</b>  tries  to  fully  qualify  the  addresses in every address field.  Your MTA is supposed to add the
       correct domain, if there is none after aliasing.

       The draft is filed to the folders in the Fcc headers by <b>refile</b>.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>spost</b>  in  mmh-0.1  used <b>sendmail</b>'s <u>-t</u> flag to have <b>sendmail</b> extract the recipients from the message
       headers. Now, it passes the recipients as command line arguments. This provides better  compatibility  to
       other sendmail implementations.
