</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nullmailer-send - Send queued messages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nullmailer-send</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the  transmission of messages that have been queued by
       <b>nullmailer-queue</b>.  It uses a variety of protocol modules to deliver the messages from the queue to remote
       "smart" servers.

       When the program starts, the queue is scanned to build  a  list  of  messages  to  send.   The  queue  is
       rescanned  when  either  the  trigger  is  pulled, or after <b>pausetime</b> seconds have elapsed after the last
       failed delivery.  When there are no messages in the  queue,  nullmailer  does  no  rescanning  until  the
       trigger  is  pulled.   Pulling  the  trigger  consists of opening up the trigger named pipe and writing a
       single byte to it, which causes this program to be awakened (if it's not already processing  the  queue).
       This  procedure  is  done by <b>nullmailer-queue</b> to ensure that messages are delivered immediately.  You can
       start delivery by hand from the command line like this:

           echo 1 &gt; trigger

       Delivery of messages consists of reading the list of remote  servers  and  then  trying  to  deliver  the
       messages  to  these  servers  as  follows.   For  each  remote in the list, the named protocol handler is
       executed once for each message remaining in the queue.  If the protocol handler succeeds, the message  is
       removed from the queue and processing continues with the next message.  If the protocol handler reports a
       permanent  failure  or  the message has been in the queue longer than <u>queuelifetime</u>, the message is moved
       into the <b>failed</b> queue and a bounce message is generated with <b>nullmailer-dsn</b>.  If any messages  remain  in
       the  queue,  processing  of  the remaining messages continues with the next remote.  When all the remotes
       have been tried, <b>nullmailer-send</b> sleeps for a number of seconds specified by  <b>pausetime</b>  before  retrying
       sending the contents of the queue.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROL</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       All the control files are reread each time the queue is run.

       <b>helohost</b>
              Sets  the  environment  variable  <b>$HELOHOST</b>  which  is used by the SMTP protocol module to set the
              parameter given to the <u>HELO</u> command.  Defaults to the value of the <b>me</b> configuration file.

       <b>maxpause</b>
              The maximum time to pause between successive  queue  runs,  in  seconds.   Defaults  to  24  hours
              (<b>86400</b>).

       <b>pausetime</b>
              The  minimum  time to pause between successive queue runs when there are messages in the queue, in
              seconds.  Defaults to 1 minute (<b>60</b>).  Each time this timeout is reached, the timeout is doubled to
              a maximum of <b>maxpause</b>.  After new messages are injected, the timeout is reset.  If this is set  to
              <b>0</b>, nullmailer-send will exit immediately after going through the queue once (one-shot mode).

       <b>queuelifetime</b>
              The  maximum  time  a  message is allowed to live in the queue before being considered permanently
              failed, in seconds. Defaults to 7 days (<b>604800</b>).

       <b>remotes</b>
              This file contains a list of remote servers to which to send each message.  Each line of this file
              contains a remote host name or address followed by an optional protocol string, separated by white
              space.  The protocol name defaults to <b>smtp</b>, and may be followed by  additional  options  for  that
              module.   See the "PROTOCOL OPTIONS" section for a list of the available options.  The options may
              optionally be prefixed by <u>--</u> but this is not required.  The line is parsed according  to  standard
              shell  quoting  rules.   For  example, to connect to port 2525 on your SMTP smart host, which also
              requires SMTP authentication, and initiate TLS with STARTTLS, use:

                  smarthost.dom smtp port=2525 starttls user=user pass='my pass phrase'

              Blank lines and lines starting with a pound (<u>#</u>) are ignored.

       <b>sendtimeout</b>
              The time to wait for a remote module listed above to complete sending a message before killing  it
              and  trying  again,  in seconds.  Defaults to 1 hour (<b>3600</b>).  If this is set to <b>0</b>, <b>nullmailer-send</b>
              will wait forever for messages to complete sending.

</pre><h4><b>PROTOCOL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>port=</b><u>PORT</u>
              Set an alternate port number to connect to on the remote host. For example, SMTP may use  <b>port=587</b>
              for the alternate SMTP "submission" port.

       <b>user=</b><u>USERNAME</u>
              Set the SMTP authentication user name.

       <b>pass=</b><u>PASSWORD</u>
              Set the SMTP authentication password.

       <b>source=</b><u>HOSTNAME</u>
              Set the source address for connections to the remote host.

       <b>auth-login</b>
              Force SMTP "AUTH LOGIN" mode instead of auto-detecting.

       <b>auth-external</b>
              Use SMTP "AUTH EXTERNAL" for TLS client certificate authentication.

       <b>tls</b>    Connect using TLS.  This will automatically switch the default port to <b>465</b>.

       <b>ssl</b>    Alias for the <b>tls</b> option for compatibility.

       <b>starttls</b>
              Use the <b>STARTTLS</b> command to initiate a TLS session.

       <b>x509certfile=</b><u>FILENAME</u>
              Set the filename for a TLS client certificate to send to the server.

       <b>x509keyfile=</b><u>FILENAME</u>
              Set the filename for the private key for a TLS client certificate.  Defaults to the same file name
              as <b>x509certfile</b>.

       <b>x509cafile=</b><u>FILENAME</u>
              Set the TLS certificate authority trust filename. Defaults to <b><a href="file:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt">/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt</a></b>.

       <b>x509crlfile=</b><u>FILENAME</u>
              Set the TLS certificate revocation list filename.

       <b>x509fmtder</b>
              Specify that TLS X.509 files above are in DER format instead of PEM.

       <b>insecure</b>
              Don't  abort  a  TLS  connection if the server certificate fails validation.  Use this only if you
              know the server uses an invalid certificate.

       <b>tls-anon-auth</b>
              Use TLS anonymous authentication - replacing certificate authentication.  This means  no  external
              certificates  or  passwords are needed to set up the connection.  With this option your connection
              is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle  (active  or  redirection)  attacks.   However,  the  data  are
              integrity  protected  and encrypted from passive eavesdroppers.  This option must be used with the
              insecure option - to acknowledge that you know what you are doing.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/var/spool/nullmailer/failed</b>
              The failed message queue.

       <b>/var/spool/nullmailer/queue</b>
              The outgoing message queue.

       <b>/var/spool/nullmailer/trigger</b>
              A trigger file to cause immediate delivery.

       <b>/etc/nullmailer</b>
              The configuration directory.

       <b>/usr/lib/nullmailer</b>
              The protocol program directory.
