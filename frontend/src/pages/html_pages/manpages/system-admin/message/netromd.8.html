       netromd - Send and receive NET/ROM routing messages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>netromd</b> <b>[-c]</b> <b>[-d]</b> <b>[-i]</b> <b>[-l]</b> <b>[-p</b> <b>pause]</b> <b>[-q</b> <b>quality]</b> <b>[-t</b> <b>interval]</b> <b>[-v]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For  a  NET/ROM  based network to operate correctly, a periodic broadcast of routing information needs to
       occur. Typically this occurs once every hour on every port which is expected to  carry  NET/ROM  traffic.
       The  purpose  of <b>netromd</b> is to send and receive NET/ROM routing broadcasts. To operate correctly a set of
       parameters that corresponds to each AX.25 port needs to be passed to the  program.  This  information  is
       encoded  in  a  configuration file, by default which is /etc/ax25/nrbroadcast with each line representing
       one port, see the manual page for <b><a href="../man5/nrbroadcast.5.html">nrbroadcast</a></b>(5).

       To cut down the length of these routing broadcasts,  only  the  information  about  the  highest  quality
       neighbour for a particular node is transmitted.  The transmission is also limited to those node that have
       a  certain  minimum  value  in  their  obsolesence  count, this value is decremented every time a routing
       broadcast is transmitted, and  is  refreshed  by  receiving  a  routing  broadcast  which  contains  that
       particular node.

       The  value  of  the  default quality is traditionally assigned a value that represents the quality of the
       radio links on that port. A higher number representing better radio links with 255 (the maximum) reserved
       for wire connections. The practise in the UK is to set the default quality to a low value, typically  10,
       and  manually set up the trusted neighbouring nodes in the neighbour list manually. The worst quality for
       auto-updates value is a way to filter out low quality (ie distant) nodes.

       The verbose flag may be either 0 or 1, representing no and yes. By specifying no, the program  will  only
       generate  a  routing  message containing information about the node on which it is running, by specifying
       the yes option, all the information in the  nodes  routing  tables  will  be  transmitted.   The  quality
       advertised for the other node callsigns on this machine may be set using the -q option.

       Between  each  transmission  <b>netromd</b>  pauses  for  five  seconds (default) in order to avoid flooding the
       channels that it must broadcast on. The value of this delay is settable with the -p option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>              Forces strict compliance to Software 2000 specifications. At present this only determines
                       how node mnemonics with lower case characters will be handled.  With  compliance  enabled
                       mixed  case  node  mnemonics  will be ignored. The default is to accept node mnemonics of
                       mixed case.

       <b>-d</b>              Switches on debugging messages, the default is off. Logging must be enabled for  them  to
                       be output.

       <b>-i</b>              Transmit a routing broadcast immediately, the default is to wait for the time interval to
                       elapse before transmitting the first routing broadcast.

       <b>-l</b>              Enables logging of errors and debug messages to the system log. The default is off.

       <b>-p</b> <b>pause</b>        Sets the delay between transmissions of individual routing broadcast packets. The default
                       is five seconds.

       <b>-q</b> <b>quality</b>      Sets the quality of the subsidiary nodes relative to the main node. The default is 255.

       <b>-t</b> <b>interval</b>     The time interval between routing broadcasts, in minutes. The default is 60 minutes.

       <b>-v</b>              Display the version.
