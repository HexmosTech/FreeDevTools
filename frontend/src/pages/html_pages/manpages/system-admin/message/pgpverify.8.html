</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pgpverify - cryptographically verify Usenet control messages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pgpverify</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>pgpverify</u> program reads (on standard input) a Usenet control message that has been cryptographically
       signed using the <u>signcontrol</u> program.  <u>pgpverify</u> then uses the <u>pgp</u> program to determine  who  signed  the
       control message.  If the control message was validly signed, <u>pgpverify</u> outputs (to stdout) the User ID of
       the key ID that signed the message.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pgpverify</u> program takes no options.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>pgpverify</u> returns the follow exit statuses for the following cases:

       <b>0</b>      The control message had a good PGP signature.

       <b>1</b>      The control message had no PGP signature.

       <b>2</b>      The control message had an unknown PGP signature.

       <b>3</b>      The control message had a bad PGP signature.

       <b>255</b>    A problem occurred not directly related to PGP analysis of signature.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       David C Lawrence &lt;<a href="mailto:tale@isc.org">tale@isc.org</a>&gt;

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>pgpverify</u>  does not modify or otherwise alter the environment before invoking the <u>pgp</u> program.  It is the
       responsibility of the person who installs <u>pgpverify</u> to ensure that when <u>pgp</u> runs, it has the  ability  to
       locate  and  read  a  PGP key file that contains the PGP public keys for the appropriate Usenet hierarchy
       administrators.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Historically, Usenet news server administrators have configured their news servers to automatically honor
       Usenet control messages based on the originator of the control messages and the hierarchies for which the
       control messages applied.  For example, in the past, David C Lawrence &lt;<a href="mailto:tale@uunet.uu.net">tale@uunet.uu.net</a>&gt;  always  issued
       control messages for the "Big 8" hierarchies (comp, humanities, misc, news, rec, sci, soc, talk).  Usenet
       news  administrators  would  configure  their  news  server  software to automatically honor newgroup and
       rmgroup control messages that originated from David Lawrence and applied to any of the Big 8 hierarchies.

       Unfortunately, Usenet news articles (including control messages) are notoriously easy  to  forge.   Soon,
       malicious  users  realized  they  could  create or remove (at least temporarily) any Big 8 newsgroup they
       wanted by simply forging an appropriate control message in David Lawrence's name.  As Usenet became  more
       widely used, forgeries became more common.

       The  <u>pgpverify</u>  program  was  designed  to allow Usenet news administrators to configure their servers to
       cryptographically verify control messages before automatically  acting  on  them.   Under  the  pgpverify
       system,  a  Usenet hierarchy maintainer creates a PGP public/private key pair and disseminates the public
       key.  Whenever the hierarchy maintainer issues a control message, he uses the <u>signcontrol</u> program to sign
       the control message with the PGP private key.  Usenet news administrators configure their news servers to
       run the <u>pgpverify</u> program on the appropriate control messages, and take action based on the PGP key  User
       ID that signed the control message, not the name and address that appear in the control message's From or
       Sender headers.

       Thus,  using  the <u>signcontrol</u> and <u>pgpverify</u> <u>programs</u> appropriately essentially eliminates the possibility
       of malicious users forging Usenet control messages that sites will act upon, as such users would have  to
       obtain  the  PGP  private  key  in  order  to  forge  a control message that would pass the cryptographic
       verification step.  If the hierarchy administrators properly protect their PGP private keys, the only way
       a malicious user could forge a validly-signed control message would be by  breaking  the  RSA  encryption
       algorithm, which (at least at this time) is believed to be an NP-complete problem.  If this is indeed the
       case,  discovering  the PGP private key based on the PGP public key is computationally impossible for PGP
       keys of a sufficient bit length.

       &lt;URL:<a href="ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/">ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/</a>&gt; is where the most recent versions of  <u>signcontrol</u>  and  <u>pgpverify</u>
       live, along with PGP public keys used for hierarchy administration.

                                                                                                    <u><a href="../man8/pgpverify.8.html">pgpverify</a></u>(8)
