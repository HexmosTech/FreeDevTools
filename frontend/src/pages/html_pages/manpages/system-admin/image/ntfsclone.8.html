       ntfsclone - Efficiently clone, image, restore or rescue an NTFS

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ntfsclone</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>SOURCE</u>
       <b>ntfsclone</b> <b>--save-image</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>SOURCE</u>
       <b>ntfsclone</b> <b>--restore-image</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>SOURCE</u>
       <b>ntfsclone</b> <b>--metadata</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>SOURCE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ntfsclone</b>  will  efficiently clone (copy, save, backup, restore) or rescue an NTFS filesystem to a sparse
       file, image, device (partition) or standard output.  It works at disk sector level and  copies  only  the
       used data. Unused disk space becomes zero (cloning to sparse file), encoded with control codes (saving in
       special  image  format),  left  unchanged  (cloning to a disk/partition) or filled with zeros (cloning to
       standard output).

       <b>ntfsclone</b> can be useful to make backups, an exact snapshot of an NTFS filesystem and restore it later on,
       or for developers to test NTFS read/write functionality, troubleshoot/investigate users' issues using the
       clone without the risk of destroying the original filesystem.

       The clone, if not using the special image format, is an exact copy of the original NTFS  filesystem  from
       sector  to sector thus it can be also mounted just like the original NTFS filesystem.  For example if you
       clone to a file and the kernel has loopback device and NTFS support then the file can be mounted as

              <b>mount</b> <b>-t</b> <b>ntfs</b> <b>-o</b> <b>loop</b> <b>ntfsclone.img</b> <b>/mnt/ntfsclone</b>

   <b>Windows</b> <b>Cloning</b>
       If you want to copy, move or restore a system or boot partition to another computer, or  to  a  different
       disk  or  partition (e.g. hda1-&gt;hda2, hda1-&gt;hdb1 or to a different disk sector offset) then you will need
       to take extra care.

       Usually, Windows will not be able to boot, unless you copy, move or restore NTFS to  the  same  partition
       which  starts at the same sector on the same type of disk having the same BIOS legacy cylinder setting as
       the original partition and disk had.

       The ntfsclone utility guarantees to make an exact copy of NTFS but it won't  deal  with  booting  issues.
       This  is  by  design:  ntfsclone  is  a filesystem, not system utility. Its aim is only NTFS cloning, not
       Windows cloning. Hereby ntfsclone can be used as a very fast and reliable build block for Windows cloning
       but itself it's not enough.

   <b>Sparse</b> <b>Files</b>
       A file is sparse if it has unallocated blocks (holes). The reported size of such files are always  higher
       than the disk space consumed by them.  The <b>du</b> command can tell the real disk space used by a sparse file.
       The  holes  are always read as zeros. All major Linux filesystem like, ext2, ext3, reiserfs, Reiser4, JFS
       and XFS, supports sparse files but for example the ISO 9600 CD-ROM filesystem doesn't.

   <b>Handling</b> <b>Large</b> <b>Sparse</b> <b>Files</b>
       As of today Linux provides inadequate support for managing (tar, cp, gzip, gunzip, bzip2,  bunzip2,  cat,
       etc)  large  sparse  files.   The  only  main  Linux  filesystem having support for efficient sparse file
       handling is XFS by the XFS_IOC_GETBMAPX <b><a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</a></b>(2)<b>.</b>  However none of  the  common  utilities  supports  it.
       This  means when you tar, cp, gzip, bzip2, etc a large sparse file they will always read the entire file,
       even if you use the "sparse support" options.

       <b><a href="../man1/bzip2.1.html">bzip2</a></b>(1) compresses large sparse files much better than <b><a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a></b>(1) but it does so also much slower. Moreover
       neither of them handles large sparse files efficiently during uncompression from disk space  usage  point
       of view.

       At  present  the  most  efficient way, both speed and space-wise, to compress and uncompress large sparse
       files by common tools would be using <b><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a></b>(1) with the options <b>-S</b> (handle sparse files  "efficiently")  and
       <b>-j</b>  (filter the archive through bzip2). Although <b>tar</b> still reads and analyses the entire file, it doesn't
       pass on the large data blocks having only zeros to filters and it also avoids  writing  large  amount  of
       zeros to the disk needlessly. But since <b>tar</b> can't create an archive from the standard input, you can't do
       this  in-place  by  just  reading <b>ntfsclone</b> standard output. Even more sadly, using the -S option results
       serious data loss since the end of 2004 and the GNU <b>tar</b> maintainers didn't release fixed  versions  until
       the present day.

   <b>The</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Image</b> <b>Format</b>
       It's  also  possible,  actually  it's  recommended, to save an NTFS filesystem to a special image format.
       Instead of representing unallocated blocks as holes, they are encoded  using  control  codes.  Thus,  the
       image  saves  space  without  requiring  sparse  file  support.  The  image format is ideal for streaming
       filesystem images over the network and similar, and can be used as a replacement for Ghost  or  Partition
       Image  if  it  is combined with other tools. The downside is that you can't mount the image directly, you
       need to restore it first.

       To save an image using the special image format, use the <b>-s</b> or the <b>--save-image</b>  option.  To  restore  an
       image,  use the <b>-r</b> or the <b>--restore-image</b> option. Note that you can restore images from standard input by
       using '-' as the <u>SOURCE</u> file.

   <b>Metadata-only</b> <b>Cloning</b>
       One of the features of <b>ntfsclone</b> is that, it can also save only the NTFS metadata using the option <b>-m</b>  or
       <b>--metadata</b> and the clone still will be mountable. In this case all non-metadata file content will be lost
       and reading them back will result always zeros.

       The  metadata-only  image  can be compressed very well, usually to not more than 1-8 MB thus it's easy to
       transfer for investigation, troubleshooting.

       In this mode of ntfsclone, <b>NONE</b> of the user's data is saved, including the resident user's data  embedded
       into  metadata.  All  is  filled with zeros.  Moreover all the file timestamps, deleted and unused spaces
       inside the metadata are filled with zeros. Thus this mode  is  inappropriate  for  example  for  forensic
       analyses.  This mode may be combined with <b>--save-image</b> to create a special image format file instead of a
       sparse file.

       Please note, filenames are not wiped out. They might contain sensitive information, so think twice before
       sending such an image to anybody.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Below  is  a  summary  of all the options that <b>ntfsclone</b> accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent
       names.  The short name is preceded by <b>-</b> and the long name is preceded by <b>--</b> <b>.</b>  Any single letter options,
       that don't take an argument, can be combined into a single command, e.g.  <b>-fv</b> is equivalent to  <b>-f</b>  <b>-v</b>  <b>.</b>
       Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output</b> FILE
              Clone  NTFS  to  the  non-existent  <u>FILE</u>.   If <u>FILE</u> is '-' then clone to the standard output. This
              option cannot be used for creating a partition, use <b>--overwrite</b> for an existing partition.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--overwrite</b> FILE
              Clone NTFS to <u>FILE</u>, which can be an existing partition or a regular file which will be overwritten
              if it exists.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--save-image</b>
              Save to the special image format. This is the most efficient way space and speed-wise  if  imaging
              is  done  to  the  standard  output, e.g. for image compression, encryption or streaming through a
              network.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--restore-image</b>
              Restore from the special image format specified by <u>SOURCE</u> argument. If the <u>SOURCE</u> is '-' then  the
              image is read from the standard input.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-action</b>
              Test  the  consistency  of a saved image by simulating its restoring without writing anything. The
              NTFS data contained in the image is not tested.  The option <b>--restore-image</b> must also be  present,
              and the options <b>--output</b> and <b>--overwrite</b> must be omitted.

       <b>--rescue</b>
              Ignore  disk  read  errors  so disks having bad sectors, e.g. dying disks, can be rescued the most
              efficiently way, with minimal stress on them. Ntfsclone works at the lowest, sector level in  this
              mode  too  thus  more  data  can be rescued.  The contents of the unreadable sectors are filled by
              character '?' and the beginning of such sectors are marked by "BadSectoR\0".

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--metadata</b>
              Clone <b>ONLY</b> <b>METADATA</b> (for NTFS experts). Only cloning to a (sparse) file is  allowed,  unless  used
              the option <b>--save-image</b> is also used.  You can't metadata-only clone to a device.

       <b>--ignore-fs-check</b>
              Ignore the result of the filesystem consistency check. This option is allowed to be used only with
              the  <b>--metadata</b>  option, for the safety of user's data. The clusters which cause the inconsistency
              are saved too.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--preserve-timestamps</b>
              Do not wipe the timestamps, to be used only with the <b>--metadata</b> option.

       <b>--full-logfile</b>
              Include the Windows log file in the copy. This is only useful for extracting metadata,  saving  or
              cloning a file system which was not properly unmounted from Windows.

       <b>--new-serial</b>, or

       <b>--new-half-serial</b>
              Set a new random serial number to the clone. The serial number is a 64 bit number used to identify
              the device during the mounting process, so it has to be changed to enable the original file system
              and the clone to be mounted at the same time on the same computer.

              The  option  <b>--new-half-serial</b> only changes the upper part of the serial number, keeping the lower
              part which is used by Windows unchanged.

              The options <b>--new-serial</b> and <b>--new-half-serial</b> can only be used when  cloning  a  file  system  of
              restoring from an image.

              The  serial number is not the volume UUID used by Windows to locate files which have been moved to
              another volume.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
              Forces ntfsclone to proceed if the filesystem is marked "dirty" for consistency check.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Do not display any progress-bars during operation.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  no  known problems with <b>ntfsclone</b>.  If you think you have found a problem then please send an
       email describing it to the development team: <a href="mailto:ntfs-3g-devel@lists.sf.net">ntfs-3g-devel@lists.sf.net</a>

       Sometimes it might appear ntfsclone froze if the clone is on ReiserFS and even CTRL-C won't stop it. This
       is not a bug in ntfsclone, however it's due to ReiserFS being extremely inefficient creating large sparse
       files and not handling signals during this operation.  This  ReiserFS  problem  was  improved  in  kernel
       2.4.22.  XFS, JFS and ext3 don't have this problem.
