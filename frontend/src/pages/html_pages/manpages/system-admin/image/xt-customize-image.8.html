</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xt-customize-image - Customize a freshly installed copy of GNU/Linux

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         xt-customize-image [options]

         Help Options:
          --help     Show this scripts help information.
          --manual   Read this scripts manual.
          --version  Show the version number and exit.

         Debugging Options:
          --verbose  Be verbose in our execution.

         Mandatory Options:
          --location The location of the new installation
          --dist     The name of the distribution which has been installed.

         All other options from xen-create-image, such as the new IP address(es)
        to give to the new instance, will be passed as environmental variables.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
         This script is invoked by xen-create-image after it has created a
        fresh installation of Linux within a temporary location.

         This script will be invoked with a full copy of the arguments from
        xen-create-image in its environment, along with several command line
        arguments.

         The command line arguments which are mandatory are:

          --location  - The temporary installation root of the new install
          --dist      - The distribution which has been installed.

</pre><h4><b>HOOK</b> <b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
         The distribution name is used to locate an appropriate collection
        of scripts, or hooks, to execute to do the actual customisation.

         The hooks will each be executed with a single parameter which is
        the directory path to the new instance.  This argument is taken from
        the --location option.

         For the distribution named 'foo' the scripts will be loaded and
        executed from '/usr/share/xen-tools/foo.d'.  Each executable will
        be loaded and executed in sorted order.

         The systems administrator can optionally provide site-specific
        revisions of those same hooks by placing them in the directory
        '/etc/xen-tools/hooks.d/' in which case a script with the same name
        as the one in the 'foo.d' directory above will take precedence. In
        this way certain hooks can be prevented from running, expanded with
        site-specific features which won't get overwritten on upgrades, or
        patched with critical bug-fixes before the upstream OS distribution
        provider reacts.
