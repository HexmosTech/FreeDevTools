       memdump - memory dumper

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>memdump</b> [<b>-kv</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>buffer_size</u>] [<b>-d</b> <u>dump_size</u>] [<b>-m</b> <u>map_file</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>page_size</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  dumps system memory to the standard output stream, skipping over holes in memory maps.  By
       default, the program dumps the contents of physical memory (<b>/dev/mem</b>).

       Output is in the form of a  raw  dump;  if  necessary,  use  the  <b>-m</b>  option  to  capture  memory  layout
       information.

       Output  should  be  sent  off-host  over the network, to avoid changing all the memory in the file system
       cache. Use netcat, stunnel, or openssl, depending on your requirements.

       The size arguments below understand the <b>k</b> (kilo) <b>m</b> (mega)  and  <b>g</b>  (giga)  suffixes.  Suffixes  are  case
       insensitive.

       Options

       <b>-k</b>     Attempt to dump kernel memory (<b>/dev/kmem</b>) rather than physical memory.

              Warning:  this  can  lock  up  the  system to the point that you have to use the power switch (for
              example, Solaris 8 on 64-bit SPARC).

              Warning: this produces bogus results on Linux 2.2 kernels.

              Warning: this is very slow on 64-bit machines because the entire memory address range  has  to  be
              searched.

              Warning:  kernel  virtual  memory  mappings  change frequently. Depending on the operating system,
              mappings smaller than <u>page_size</u> or <u>buffer_size</u> may be missed or may be reported incorrectly.

       <b>-b</b> <u>buffer_size</u> (default: 0)
              Number of bytes per memory read operation. By default, the program uses the <u>page_size</u> value.

              Warning: a too large read buffer size causes memory to be missed on FreeBSD or Solaris.

       <b>-s</b> <u>dump-size</u> (default: 0)
              Number of memory bytes to dump. By default, the program runs until the memory  device  reports  an
              end-of-file  (Linux),  or  until it has dumped from <b>/dev/mem</b> as much memory as reported present by
              the kernel (FreeBSD, Solaris), or until pointer wrap-around happens.

              Warning: a too large value causes the program to spend a lot of time  skipping  over  non-existent
              memory on Solaris systems.

              Warning: a too large value causes the program to copy non-existent data on FreeBSD systems.

       <b>-m</b> <u>map_file</u>
              Write  the memory map to <u>map_file</u>, one entry per line.  Specify <b>-m-</b> to write to the standard error
              stream.  Each map entry consists of a region start address  and  the  first  address  beyond  that
              region. Addresses are separated by space, and are printed as hexadecimal numbers (0xhhhh).

       <b>-p</b> <u>page_size</u> (default: 0)
              Use <u>page_size</u> as the memory page size. By default the program uses the system page size.

              Warning: a too large page size causes memory to be missed while skipping over holes in memory.

       <b>-v</b>     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple <b>-v</b> options make the program more verbose.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       On  many  hardware platforms the firmware (boot PROM, BIOS, etc.)  takes away some memory. This memory is
       not accessible through <b>/dev/mem</b>.

       This program should produce output in a format that supports structure information such as ELF.
