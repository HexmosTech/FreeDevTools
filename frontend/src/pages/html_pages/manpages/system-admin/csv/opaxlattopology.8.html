       opaxlattopology

       Generates  a  topology XML file of a cluster using your customized &lt;topologyfile&gt;.csv, linksum_swd06.csv,
       and linksum_swd24.csv as input. The output topology XML file can be used  to  bring  up  and  verify  the
       cluster.

       <b>NOTE:</b>  The  &lt;topologyfile&gt;.csv  input  file  must  be present in the same directory from which the script
       operates, but the linksum CSV files are read from the /usr/share/opa/samples directory.

</pre><h4><b>Syntax</b></h4><pre>
       opaxlattopology [-d  <u>level</u>] [-v  <u>level</u>] [-i  <u>level</u>] [-K] [-s  <u>hfi_suffix</u>]

       [source [dest]]

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       --help

                 Produces full help text.

       -d <u>level</u>

                 Specifies the output detail level. Default is 0. Levels are additive.

                 By default, the top level is always produced. Switch, rack, and rack group topology  files  can
                 be  added  to  the output by choosing the appropriate level. If the output at the group or rack
                 level is specified, then group or rack names must be  provided  in  the  spreadsheet.  Detailed
                 output  can  be specified in any combination. A directory for each topology XML file is created
                 hierarchically, with group directories (if specified) at the highest level,  followed  by  rack
                 and switch directories (if specified).

                 1         Intel(R) Omni-Path Edge Switch 100 Series topology files.

                 2         Rack topology files.

                 4         Rack group topology files.

       -v <u>level</u>

                 Specifies the verbose level. Range is 0 - 8. Default is 2.

                 0         No output.

                 1         Progress output.

                 2         Reserved.

                 4         Time stamps.

                 8         Reserved.

       -i <u>level</u>

                 Specifies the output indent level. Default is 4.

       -K

                 Specifies DO NOT clean temporary files.

                 Prevents temporary files in each topology directory from being removed. Temporary files contain
                 CSV  formatted lists of links, HFIs, and switches used to create a topology XML file. Temporary
                 files are not typically needed after a topology file is created,  however  they  are  used  for
                 creating  linksum_swd06.csv  and  linksum_swd24.csv  files,  or  can be retained for subsequent
                 inspection or processing.

       -s <u>hfi_suffix</u>

                 Used on Multi-Rail or Multi-Plane fabrics. Can be used to override the default hfi1_0.

                 For Multi-Plane fabric, use the tool multiple times with a different hfi-suffix.

                 For Multi-Rail fabric, specify HostName as "HostName HfiName" in the spreadsheet.

       -o report

                 Specifies the report type for output. By default, all the sections are generated.

                 Report Types:

                 brnodes   Creates the &lt;Node&gt; section xml for the csv input.

                 links     Creates the &lt;LinkSummary&gt; section xml for the csv input.

       source

                 Specifies the source csv file. Default is topology.csv.

       dest

                 Specifies the output xml file. Default is topology.0:0.xml

                 The default output file name may vary if used with -s option. It can also be  used  to  specify
                 destination folder.

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The  opaxlattopology  script  reads your customized &lt;topologyfile&gt;.csv file from the local directory, and
       reads      the      other       files       from       /usr/share/opa/samples/linksum_swd06.csv       and
       /usr/share/opa/samples/linksum_swd24.csv.  Two  sample  topology  XLSX  files, detailed_topology.xlsx and
       minimal_topology.xlsx, are located  in  the  /usr/share/opa/samples/  directory.  You  must  create  your
       &lt;topologyfile&gt;.csv  file  by  editing one of the sample spreadsheets and saving the Fabric Links tab as a
       CSV file. Inspect your &lt;topologyfile&gt;.csv file to ensure that each row  contains  the  correct  and  same
       number  of  comma  separators. Any extraneous entries in the spreadsheet can cause the CSV output to have
       extra fields.

       The script outputs one or more topology files starting  with  topology.0:0.xml.  Your  &lt;topologyfile&gt;.csv
       input  file  must  be  present  in the same directory from which the script operates, but the linksum CSV
       files are read from the /usr/share/opa/samples directory.

</pre><h4><b>Example</b></h4><pre>
       opaxlattopology

       # reads default input 'topology.csv' and creates default

       # output 'topology.0:0.xml'

       opaxlattopology fabric_2.csv

       # reads input 'fabric_2.csv' and creates default output

       Both sample files contain examples of links between HFI and Edge SW (rows 4-7), HFI  and  Core  SW  (rows
       8-11), and Edge SW and Core SW (rows 12-15).

</pre><h4><b>Environment</b> <b>Variables</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables allow user-specified MTU.

       <b>MTU_SW_SW</b>

                 If set, it overrides default MTU on switch-to-switch links. Default is 10240

       <b>MTU_SW_HFI</b>

                 If set, it overrides default MTU on switch-to-HFI links. Default is 10240

</pre><h4><b>Creating</b> <b>linksum</b> <b>Files</b></h4><pre>
       The   linksum_swd06.csv   and   linksum_swd24.csv   files  are  provided  as  stand-alone  files  in  the
       /usr/share/opa/samples directory. However, they can be recreated (or modified) from the  spreadsheet,  if
       needed, by performing the following steps:

       1)  Save each of the following from your custom &lt;topologyfile&gt;.xlsx file as individual .csv files:

       •   Internal SWD06 Links tab as linksum_swd06.csv

       •   Internal SWD24 Links tab as linksum_swd24.csv

       •   Fabric Links tab as &lt;topologyfile&gt;.csv

       2)  For each saved &lt;topologyfile&gt;.csv file, run the script with the -K option.

       3)  Upon  completion  of  the  script,  save  the  top  level  linksum.csv  file  as linksum_swd06.csv or
           linksum_swd24.csv as appropriate.

</pre><h4><b>Multi-Rail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Multi-Plane</b> <b>Fabrics</b></h4><pre>
       By default, the opaxlattopology script considers all of the hosts to have a single HFI (hfi1_0).

       For Multi-Rail/Multi-Plane fabrics, you have the following options:

       •      For Multi-Rail fabrics or for a Single Plane fabric with some multi-ported hosts, you can edit the
              Host Name in your customized &lt;topologyfile&gt;.csv  file  to  include  the  HFI  Name  (for  example:
              HostName HfiName) and then follow the standard procedure to generate &lt;topologyfile&gt;.xml.

       •      For  a  Multi-Plane  fabric  with identical planes, the tool can be run multiple times on the same
              &lt;topologyfile&gt;.csv with different -s hfi_suffix options.  For example, if there are two  identical
              fabrics  (fabric_1 and fabric_2) connected to a single host with two HFIs (hfi1_0 and hfi1_1), the
              tool can be run twice like this:

       •      For fabric_1:

              opaxlattopology &lt;topologyfile&gt;.csv &lt;topologyfile&gt;.xml

       •      For fabric_2:

              opaxlattopology -s hfi1_1 &lt;topologyfile&gt;.csv &lt;topologyfile&gt;.xml

       •      For a fabric with both Multi-Rail and Multi-Plane segments, you can use a combination of the above
              techniques to generate the desired &lt;topologyfile&gt;.xml file.
