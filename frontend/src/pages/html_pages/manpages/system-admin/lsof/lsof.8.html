</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Lsof</u>  revision  4.99.4  lists on its standard output file information about files opened by processes for
       the following UNIX dialects:

            Apple Darwin 9, Mac OS X 10, macOS 11 and above
            FreeBSD 8.2 and above
            Linux 2.1.72 and above
            NetBSD 1.2 and above
            OpenBSD 7.2 and above
            Solaris 9, 10 and 11 and above
            OpenIndiana 5.11 and above

       (See the <b>DISTRIBUTION</b> section of this manual page for information  on  how  to  obtain  the  latest  <u>lsof</u>
       revision.)

       An  open  file  may  be  a  regular file, a directory, a block special file, a character special file, an
       executing text reference, a library, a stream or a network file (Internet socket, NFS file or UNIX domain
       socket.)  A specific file or all the files in a file system may be selected by path.

       Instead of a formatted display, <u>lsof</u> will produce output that can be parsed by other programs.   See  the
       <b>-F</b>, option description, and the <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b> section for more information.

       In  addition  to  producing  a  single output list, <u>lsof</u> will run in repeat mode.  In repeat mode it will
       produce output, delay, then repeat the output operation until stopped with an interrupt or  quit  signal.
       See the <b>+|-r</b> <u>[t[m&lt;fmt&gt;]]</u> option description for more information.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In the absence of any options, <u>lsof</u> lists all open files belonging to all active processes.

       If any list request option is specified, other list requests must be specifically requested - e.g., if <b>-U</b>
       is specified for the listing of UNIX socket files, NFS files won't be listed unless <b>-N</b> is also specified;
       or  if  a  user list is specified with the <b>-u</b> option, UNIX domain socket files, belonging to users not in
       the list, won't be listed unless the <b>-U</b> option is also specified.

       Normally, list options that are specifically stated are ORed - i.e., specifying the <b>-i</b> option without  an
       address  and  the  <b>-u</b>foo  option  produces a listing of all network files OR files belonging to processes
       owned by user ``foo''.  The exceptions are:

       1) the `^' (negated) login name or user ID (UID), specified with the <b>-u</b> option;

       2) the `^' (negated) process ID (PID), specified with the <b>-p</b> option;

       3) the `^' (negated) process group ID (PGID), specified with the <b>-g</b> option;

       4) the `^' (negated) command, specified with the <b>-c</b> option;

       5) the (`^') negated TCP or UDP protocol state names, specified with the <b>-s</b> <u>[p:s]</u> option.

       Since they represent exclusions, they are applied without ORing or ANDing  and  take  effect  before  any
       other selection criteria are applied.

       The  <b>-a</b>  option  may be used to AND the selections.  For example, specifying <b>-a</b>, <b>-U</b>, and <b>-u</b>foo produces a
       listing of only UNIX socket files that belong to processes owned by user ``foo''.

       Caution: the <b>-a</b> option causes all list selection options to be ANDed; it can't be used to cause ANDing of
       selected pairs of selection options by placing it between  them,  even  though  its  placement  there  is
       acceptable.  Wherever <b>-a</b> is placed, it causes the ANDing of all selection options.

       Items  of  the  same  selection  set  -  command  names,  file  descriptors,  network  addresses, process
       identifiers, user identifiers, zone names, security contexts - are  joined  in  a  single  ORed  set  and
       applied  before the result participates in ANDing.  Thus, for example, specifying <b>-i</b>@aaa.bbb, <b>-i</b>@ccc.ddd,
       <b>-a</b>, and <b>-u</b>fff,ggg will select the listing of files that belong to either login  ``fff''  OR  ``ggg''  AND
       have network connections to either host aaa.bbb OR ccc.ddd.

       Options  may  be  grouped  together following a single prefix -- e.g., the option set ``<b>-a</b> <b>-b</b> <b>-C</b>'' may be
       stated as <b>-abC</b>.  However, since values are optional following <b>+|-f</b>, <b>-F</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>+|-L</b>, <b>-o</b>, <b>+|-r</b>,  <b>-s</b>,  <b>-S</b>,
       <b>-T</b>, <b>-x</b> and <b>-z</b>.  when you have no values for them be careful that the following character isn't ambiguous.
       For  example,  <b>-Fn</b>  might  represent  the <b>-F</b> and <b>-n</b> options, or it might represent the <b>n</b> field identifier
       character following the <b>-F</b> option.  When ambiguity is possible, start a new option with a `-' character -
       e.g., ``<b>-F</b> <b>-n</b>''.  If the next option is a file name, follow the possibly ambiguous option with  ``--''  -
       e.g., ``<b>-F</b> <b>--</b> <u>name</u>''.

       Either  the  `+'  or  the  `-'  prefix  may be applied to a group of options.  Options that don't take on
       separate meanings for each prefix - e.g., <b>-i</b> - may be grouped under either prefix.   Thus,  for  example,
       ``+M  -i''  may be stated as ``+Mi'' and the group means the same as the separate options.  Be careful of
       prefix grouping when one or more options in the group does take  on  separate  meanings  under  different
       prefixes - e.g., <b>+|-M</b>; ``-iM'' is not the same request as ``-i +M''.  When in doubt, use separate options
       with appropriate prefixes.

       <b>-?</b> <b>-h</b>    These  two equivalent options select a usage (help) output list.  <u>Lsof</u> displays a shortened form
                of this output when it detects an error in the options supplied to it, after  it  has  displayed
                messages explaining each error.  (Escape the `?' character as your shell requires.)

       <b>-a</b>       causes list selection options to be ANDed, as described above.

       <b>-A</b> <u>A</u>     is  available  on  systems  configured  for AFS whose AFS kernel code is implemented via dynamic
                modules.  It allows the <u>lsof</u> user to specify <u>A</u> as an alternate name list file where  the  kernel
                addresses  of  the  dynamic modules might be found.  See the <u>lsof</u> FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its
                location.)  for more information about dynamic modules, their symbols, and how they affect <u>lsof</u>.

       <b>-b</b>       causes <u>lsof</u> to avoid kernel functions that might block - <u><a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a></u>(2), <u><a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink</a></u>(2), and <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2).

                See the <b>BLOCKS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TIMEOUTS</b> and <b>AVOIDING</b> <b>KERNEL</b> <b>BLOCKS</b> sections for information  on  using  this
                option.

       <b>-c</b> <u>c</u>     selects the listing of files for processes executing the command that begins with the characters
                of  <u>c</u>.   Multiple  commands  may  be specified, using multiple <b>-c</b> options.  They are joined in a
                single ORed set before participating in AND option selection.

                If <u>c</u> begins with a `^', then the following characters specify a command name whose processes are
                to be ignored (excluded.)

                If <u>c</u> begins and ends with a slash ('/'), the characters between the slashes are interpreted as a
                regular expression.  Shell meta-characters in the regular expression must be quoted  to  prevent
                their interpretation by the shell.  The closing slash may be followed by these modifiers:

                     b    the regular expression is a basic one.
                     i    ignore the case of letters.
                     x    the regular expression is an extended one
                          (default).

                See  the  <u>lsof</u>  FAQ  (The  <b>FAQ</b>  section  gives its location.)  for more information on basic and
                extended regular expressions.

                The simple command specification is tested first.  If  that  test  fails,  the  command  regular
                expression is applied.  If the simple command test succeeds, the command regular expression test
                isn't  made.   This may result in ``no command found for regex:'' messages when lsof's <b>-V</b> option
                is specified.

       <b>+c</b> <u>w</u>     defines the maximum number of initial characters of the name, supplied by the UNIX  dialect,  of
                the  UNIX  command  associated  with  a  process to be printed in the COMMAND column.  (The <u>lsof</u>
                default is nine.)

                Note that many UNIX dialects do not supply all command name characters to <u>lsof</u> in the files  and
                structures  from which <u>lsof</u> obtains command name.  Often dialects limit the number of characters
                supplied in those sources.  For example, Linux 2.4.27 and Solaris  9  both  limit  command  name
                length to 16 characters.

                If <u>w</u> is zero ('0'), all command characters supplied to <u>lsof</u> by the UNIX dialect will be printed.

                If <u>w</u> is less than the length of the column title, ``COMMAND'', it will be raised to that length.

       <b>-C</b>       disables the reporting of any path name components from the kernel's name cache.  See the <b>KERNEL</b>
                <b>NAME</b> <b>CACHE</b> section for more information.

       <b>+d</b> <u>s</u>     causes  <u>lsof</u>  to  search  for all open instances of directory <u>s</u> and the files and directories it
                contains at its top level.  <b>+d</b> does NOT descend the directory tree,  rooted  at  <u>s</u>.   The  <b>+D</b>  <u>D</u>
                option may be used to request a full-descent directory tree search, rooted at directory <u>D</u>.

                Processing  of  the  <b>+d</b>  option  does  not follow symbolic links within <u>s</u> unless the <b>-x</b> or <b>-x</b>  <b>l</b>
                option is also specified.  Nor does it search for open files on  file  system  mount  points  on
                subdirectories of <u>s</u> unless the <b>-x</b> or <b>-x</b>  <b>f</b> option is also specified.

                Note:  the  authority  of the user of this option limits it to searching for files that the user
                has permission to examine with the system <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) function.

       <b>-d</b> <u>s</u>     specifies a list of file descriptors (FDs) to exclude from or include  in  the  output  listing.
                The  file descriptors are specified in the comma-separated set <u>s</u> - e.g., ``cwd,1,3'', ``^6,^2''.
                (There should be no spaces in the set.)

                The list is an exclusion list if all entries of the set begin with `^'.  It is an inclusion list
                if no entry begins with `^'.  Mixed lists are not permitted.

                A file descriptor number range may be in the set as  long  as  neither  member  is  empty,  both
                members  are  numbers,  and the ending member is larger than the starting one - e.g., ``0-7'' or
                ``3-10''.  Ranges may be specified for exclusion if they have the `^' prefix  -  e.g.,  ``^0-7''
                excludes all file descriptors 0 through 7.

                Multiple  file  descriptor  numbers  are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND
                option selection.

                When there are exclusion and inclusion members in the set, <u>lsof</u> reports them as errors and exits
                with a non-zero return code.

                See the description of File Descriptor (FD)  output  values  in  the  <b>OUTPUT</b>  section  for  more
                information on file descriptor names.

                <b>fd</b>  is  a pseudo file descriptor name for specifying the whole range of possible file descriptor
                numbers.  <b>fd</b> does not appear in FD column of output.

       <b>+D</b> <u>D</u>     causes <u>lsof</u> to search for all open instances of directory <u>D</u> and all the files and directories it
                contains to its complete depth.

                Processing of the <b>+D</b> option does not follow symbolic links within <u>D</u>  unless  the  <b>-x</b>  or  <b>-x</b>   <b>l</b>
                option  is  also  specified.   Nor  does it search for open files on file system mount points on
                subdirectories of <u>D</u> unless the <b>-x</b> or <b>-x</b>  <b>f</b> option is also specified.

                Note: the authority of the user of this option limits it to searching for files  that  the  user
                has permission to examine with the system <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) function.

                Further  note:  <u>lsof</u> may process this option slowly and require a large amount of dynamic memory
                to do it.  This is because it must descend the entire  directory  tree,  rooted  at  <u>D</u>,  calling
                <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2)  for  each  file and directory, building a list of all the files it finds, and searching
                that list for a match with every open file.  When directory <u>D</u> is large, these steps can  take  a
                long time, so use this option prudently.

       <b>-D</b> <u>D</u>     directs  <u>lsof's</u>  use  of the device cache file.  The use of this option is sometimes restricted.
                See the <b>DEVICE</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>FILE</b> section and the sections that follow it for more information  on  this
                option.

                <b>-D</b>  must  be  followed by a function letter; the function letter may optionally be followed by a
                path name.  <u>Lsof</u> recognizes these function letters:

                     <b>?</b> - report device cache file paths
                     <b>b</b> - build the device cache file
                     <b>i</b> - ignore the device cache file
                     <b>r</b> - read the device cache file
                     <b>u</b> - read and update the device cache file

                The <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>u</b> functions, accompanied by a path name, are  sometimes  restricted.   When  these
                functions  are  restricted,  they  will  not  appear  in  the  description of the <b>-D</b> option that
                accompanies <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b>  option output.  See the <b>DEVICE</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>FILE</b> section and  the  sections  that
                follow it for more information on these functions and when they're restricted.

                The  <b>?</b>   function  reports  the read-only and write paths that lsof can use for the device cache
                file, the names of any environment variables whose values <u>lsof</u> will  examine  when  forming  the
                device cache file path, and the format for the personal device cache file path.  (Escape the `?'
                character as your shell requires.)

                When  available, the <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>u</b> functions may be followed by the device cache file's path.  The
                standard default is <u>.lsof_hostname</u> in the home directory of the real user ID that executes <u>lsof</u>,
                but this could have been changed when <u>lsof</u> was configured and compiled.  (The output of  the  <b>-h</b>
                and  <b>-?</b>   options  show the current default prefix - e.g., ``.lsof''.)  The suffix, <u>hostname</u>, is
                the first component of the host's name returned by <u><a href="../man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname</a></u>(2).

                When available, the <b>b</b> function directs <u>lsof</u> to build a new device cache file at the  default  or
                specified path.

                The  <b>i</b>  function directs <u>lsof</u> to ignore the default device cache file and obtain its information
                about devices via direct calls to the kernel.

                The <b>r</b> function directs <u>lsof</u> to read the device cache at  the  default  or  specified  path,  but
                prevents  it  from  creating  a  new  device  cache file when none exists or the existing one is
                improperly structured.  The <b>r</b> function, when specified without a path name, prevents  <u>lsof</u>  from
                updating  an incorrect or outdated device cache file, or creating a new one in its place.  The <b>r</b>
                function is always available when it is specified without  a  path  name  argument;  it  may  be
                restricted by the permissions of the <u>lsof</u> process.

                When  available,  the  <b>u</b>  function  directs <u>lsof</u> to read the device cache file at the default or
                specified path, if possible, and to rebuild it, if necessary.  This is the default device  cache
                file function when no <b>-D</b> option has been specified.

       <b>+|-e</b> <u>s</u>   exempts  the file system whose path name is <u>s</u> from being subjected to kernel function calls that
                might block.  The <b>+e</b> option exempts <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2),  <u><a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a></u>(2)  and  most  <u><a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink</a></u>(2)  kernel  function
                calls.   The  <b>-e</b>  option exempts only <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a>(2)</u> and <u><a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a></u>(2) kernel function calls.  Multiple file
                systems may be specified with separate <b>+|-e</b> specifications and each may have  <u><a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink</a></u>(2)  calls
                exempted or not.

                This option is currently implemented only for Linux.

                <b>CAUTION:</b>  this  option  can  easily  be  mis-applied  to other than the file system of interest,
                because it uses path name rather than the more reliable device and inode numbers.   (Device  and
                inode  numbers  are  acquired  via the potentially blocking <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) kernel call and are thus not
                available, but see the <b>+|-m</b> <u>m</u> option as a possible alternative way to  supply  device  numbers.)
                <b>Use</b>  <b>this</b>  <b>option</b>  <b>with</b>  <b>great</b>  <b>care</b>  <b>and</b>  <b>fully</b>  <b>specify</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b>
                <b>exempted.</b>

                When open files on exempted file systems are reported, it may not  be  possible  to  obtain  all
                their  information.   Therefore, some information columns will be blank, the characters ``UNKN''
                preface the values in the  TYPE  column,  and  the  applicable  exemption  option  is  added  in
                parentheses  to  the  end  of  the  NAME  column.  (Some device number information might be made
                available via the <b>+|-m</b> <u>m</u> option.)

       <b>+|-E</b>     <b>+E</b> specifies that Linux pipe, Linux UNIX socket, Linux <a href="../man6/INET.6.html">INET</a>(6) socket closed in  a  local  host,
                Linux  pseudoterminal  files,  POSIX  Message Queueue implementation in Linux, and Linux eventfd
                should be displayed with endpoint information and the files of  the  endpoints  should  also  be
                displayed.

                Note  1:  UNIX socket file endpoint information is only available when the features enabled line
                of <b>-v</b> output contains uxsockept, and psudoterminal endpoint information is only  available  when
                the features enabled line contains ptyept.

                Note  2: POSIX Message Queue file endpoint information is only available when mqueue file system
                is mounted.

                Pipe endpoint information is displayed in the NAME column in the form ``<u>PID,cmd,FDmode</u>'',  where
                <u>PID</u>  is  the endpoint process ID; <u>cmd</u> is the endpoint process command; <u>FD</u> is the endpoint file's
                descriptor; and <u>mode</u> is the endpoint file's access mode.

                Pseudoterminal   endpoint    information    is    displayed    in    the    NAME    column    as
                ``-&gt;<a href="file:/dev/pts">/dev/pts</a><u>min</u> <u>PID,cmd,FDmode</u>''  or ``<u>PID,cmd,FDmode</u>''.  The first form is for a master device;
                the second, for a slave device.  <u>min</u> is a slave device's minor device number; and <u>PID,</u>  <u>cmd,</u>  <u>FD</u>
                and  <u>mode</u>  are  the  same  as  with  pipe  endpoint  information.   Note: psudoterminal endpoint
                information is only available when the features enabled line of <b>-v</b> output  contains  ptyept.  In
                addition, this feature works on Linux kernels above 4.13.0.

                UNIX socket file endpoint information is displayed in the NAME column in the form
                ``type=<u>TYPE</u> -&gt;INO=<u>INODE</u> <u>PID,cmd,FDmode</u>'',  where  <u>TYPE</u>  is  the socket type; <u>INODE</u> is the i-node
                number of the connected socket; and <u>PID,</u> <u>cmd,</u> <u>FD</u> and <u>mode</u> are the same  as  with  pipe  endpoint
                information.   Note:  UNIX  socket file endpoint information is available only when the features
                enabled line of <b>-v</b> output contains uxsockept.

                INET socket file endpoint information is inserted to the value at the NAME column in the form
                `` -&gt; <u>PID,cmd,FDmode</u>'', where <u>PID,</u> <u>cmd,</u>  <u>FD</u>  and  <u>mode</u>  are  the  same  as  with  pipe  endpoint
                information.  The  endpoint  information  is available only if the socket is used for local IPC;
                both endpoints bind to the same local IPv4 or IPv6 address.

                POSIX Message Queue file endpoint information is displayed in the NAME column in the  same  form
                as that of pipe.

                eventfd  endpoint  information is displayed in the NAME column in the same form as that of pipe.
                This feature works on Linux kernels above 5.2.0.

                Multiple occurrences of this information can appear in a file's NAME column.

                <b>-E</b> specifies that endpoint supported files should be displayed with  endpoint  information,  but
                not the files of the endpoints.

       <b>+|-f</b> <b>[cfgGn]</b>
                <b>f</b>  by itself clarifies how path name arguments are to be interpreted.  When followed by <b>c</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>g</b>,
                <b>G</b>, or <b>n</b> in any combination it specifies that the listing of kernel file structure information is
                to be enabled (`+') or inhibited (`-').

                Normally a path name argument is taken to be a file system  name  if  it  matches  a  mounted-on
                directory  name  reported  by  <u><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></u>(8),  or if it represents a block device, named in the <u>mount</u>
                output and associated with a mounted directory name.   When  <b>+f</b>  is  specified,  all  path  name
                arguments  will  be  taken to be file system names, and <u>lsof</u> will complain if any are not.  This
                can be useful, for example, when the file system name (mounted-on device) isn't a block  device.
                This happens for some CD-ROM file systems.

                When <b>-f</b> is specified by itself, all path name arguments will be taken to be simple files.  Thus,
                for  example,  the  ``<b>-f</b> --  /''  arguments direct lsof to search for open files with a `/' path
                name, not all open files in the `/' (root) file system.

                Be careful to make sure <b>+f</b> and <b>-f</b> are properly terminated and aren't  followed  by  a  character
                (e.g.,  of  the  file or file system name) that might be taken as a parameter.  For example, use
                ``--'' after <b>+f</b> and <b>-f</b> as in these examples.

                     $ lsof +f -- /file/system/name
                     $ lsof -f -- /file/name

                The listing of information from kernel file structures, requested with  the  <b>+f</b>  <b>[cfgGn]</b>  option
                form,  is  normally  inhibited,  and is not available in whole or part for some dialects - e.g.,
                /proc-based Linux kernels below 2.6.22.  When the prefix to  <b>f</b>  is  a  plus  sign  (`+'),  these
                characters request file structure information:

                     <b>c</b>    file structure use count (not Linux)
                     <b>f</b>    file structure address (not Linux)

                     <b>G</b>    file flags in hexadecimal (Linux 2.6.22 and up)
                     <b>n</b>    file structure node address (not Linux)

                When the prefix is minus (`-') the same characters disable the listing of the indicated values.

                File  structure  addresses,  use  counts,  flags,  and node addresses may be used to detect more
                readily identical files inherited by child processes and identical files  in  use  by  different
                processes.   <u>Lsof</u> column output can be sorted by output columns holding the values and listed to
                identify identical file use, or <u>lsof</u> field output can be parsed by an AWK  or  Perl  post-filter
                script, or by a C program.

       <b>-F</b> <u>f</u>     specifies  a  character  list, <u>f</u>, that selects the fields to be output for processing by another
                program, and the character that terminates each output  field.   Each  field  to  be  output  is
                specified with a single character in <u>f</u>.  The field terminator defaults to NL, but may be changed
                to  NUL  (000).   See  the  <b>OUTPUT</b>  <b>FOR</b>  <b>OTHER</b>  <b>PROGRAMS</b>  section for a description of the field
                identification characters and the field output process.

                When the field selection character list is empty, all standard fields are selected  (except  the
                raw  device  field,  security context and zone field for compatibility reasons) and the NL field
                terminator is used.

                When the field selection character list contains only a zero  (`0'),  all  fields  are  selected
                (except  the  raw  device  field  for compatibility reasons) and the NUL terminator character is
                used.

                Other combinations of fields and their associated field terminator character must  be  set  with
                explicit entries in <u>f</u>, as described in the <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b> section.

                When  a  field  selection character identifies an item <u>lsof</u> does not normally list - e.g., PPID,
                selected with <b>-R</b> - specification of the field character -  e.g.,  ``<b>-FR</b>''  -  also  selects  the
                listing of the item.

                When  the  field selection character list contains the single character `?', <u>lsof</u> will display a
                help list of the field identification characters.  (Escape  the  `?'  character  as  your  shell
                requires.)

       <b>-g</b> <u>[s]</u>   excludes  or  selects  the  listing  of  files  for  the  processes whose optional process group
                IDentification (PGID) numbers are in the comma-separated set <u>s</u> - e.g., ``123'' or  ``123,^456''.
                (There should be no spaces in the set.)

                PGID numbers that begin with `^' (negation) represent exclusions.

                Multiple  PGID  numbers  are  joined  in  a  single  ORed set before participating in AND option
                selection.  However, PGID exclusions are applied without ORing or ANDing and take effect  before
                other selection criteria are applied.

                The  <b>-g</b>  option  also enables the output display of PGID numbers.  When specified without a PGID
                set that's all it does.

       <b>-H</b>       directs lsof to print human readable sizes, e.g. 123.4K 456.7M.

       <b>-i</b> <u>[i]</u>   selects the listing of files any of whose Internet address matches the address specified  in  <u>i</u>.
                If  no  address  is  specified, this option selects the listing of all Internet and x.25 (HP-UX)
                network files.

                If <b>-i</b><u>4</u> or <b>-i</b><u>6</u> is specified with no following address, only files of the  indicated  IP  version,
                IPv4  or  IPv6, are displayed.  (An IPv6 specification may be used only if the dialects supports
                IPv6, as indicated by ``[46]'' and ``IPv[46]''  in  <u>lsof's</u>  <b>-h</b>  or  <b>-?</b>   output.)   Sequentially
                specifying  <b>-i</b>4,  followed by <b>-i</b>6 is the same as specifying <b>-i</b>, and vice-versa.  Specifying <b>-i</b>4,
                or <b>-i</b>6 after <b>-i</b> is the same as specifying <b>-i</b>4 or <b>-i</b>6 by itself.

                Multiple addresses (up to a limit of 100) may be specified with multiple <b>-i</b>  options.   (A  port
                number  or  service name range is counted as one address.)  They are joined in a single ORed set
                before participating in AND option selection.

                An Internet address is specified in the form (Items in square brackets are optional.):

                [<u>46</u>][<u>protocol</u>][@<u>hostname</u>|<u>hostaddr</u>][:<u>service</u>|<u>port</u>]

                where:
                     <u>46</u> specifies the IP version, IPv4 or IPv6
                          that applies to the following address.
                          '6' may be be specified only if the UNIX
                          dialect supports IPv6.  If neither '4' nor
                          '6' is specified, the following address
                          applies to all IP versions.
                     <u>protocol</u> is a protocol name - <b>TCP</b>, <b>UDP</b> or <b>UDPLITE</b>.
                     <u>hostname</u> is an Internet host name.  Unless a
                          specific IP version is specified, open
                          network files associated with host names
                          of all versions will be selected.
                     <u>hostaddr</u> is a numeric Internet IPv4 address in
                          dot form; or an IPv6 numeric address in
                          colon form, enclosed in brackets, if the
                          UNIX dialect supports IPv6.  When an IP
                          version is selected, only its numeric
                          addresses may be specified.
                     <u>service</u> is an <u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u> name - e.g., <b>smtp</b> -
                          or a list of them.
                     <u>port</u> is a port number, or a list of them.

                IPv6 options may be used only if the UNIX dialect supports IPv6.  To see if the dialect supports
                IPv6, run <u>lsof</u> and specify the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b>  (help) option.  If the displayed description of the  <b>-i</b>
                option contains ``[46]'' and ``IPv[46]'', IPv6 is supported.

                IPv4  host names and addresses may not be specified if network file selection is limited to IPv6
                with <b>-i</b> 6.  IPv6 host names and addresses may not be specified  if  network  file  selection  is
                limited  to  IPv4  with  <b>-i</b>  4.   When  an open IPv4 network file's address is mapped in an IPv6
                address, the open file's type will be IPv6, not IPv4, and its display will be selected  by  '6',
                not '4'.

                At  least  one  address  component  -  <b>4,</b>  <b>6,</b> <u>protocol</u>, <u>hostname</u>, <u>hostaddr</u>, or <u>service</u> - must be
                supplied.  The `@' character, leading the host specification, is always required; as is the `:',
                leading the port specification.  Specify either <u>hostname</u> or <u>hostaddr</u>.   Specify  either  <u>service</u>
                name  list or <u>port</u> number list.  If a <u>service</u> name list is specified, the <u>protocol</u> may also need
                to be specified if the TCP, UDP and UDPLITE port numbers for the  service  name  are  different.
                Use any case - lower or upper - for <u>protocol</u>.

                <u>Service</u>  names  and <u>port</u> numbers may be combined in a list whose entries are separated by commas
                and whose numeric range entries are separated by minus signs.  There may be no embedded  spaces,
                and  all  service  names must belong to the specified <u>protocol</u>.  Since service names may contain
                embedded minus signs, the starting entry of a range can't be a service name; it can  be  a  port
                number, however.

                Here are some sample addresses:

                     -i6 - IPv6 only
                     TCP:25 - TCP and port 25
                     @1.2.3.4 - Internet IPv4 host address 1.2.3.4
                     @[3ffe:1ebc::1]:1234 - Internet IPv6 host address
                          3ffe:1ebc::1, port 1234
                     UDP:who - UDP who service port
                     <a href="mailto:TCP@lsof.itap">TCP@lsof.itap</a>:513 - TCP, port 513 and host name lsof.itap
                     tcp@foo:1-10,smtp,99 - TCP, ports 1 through 10,
                          service name <u>smtp</u>, port 99, host name foo
                     tcp@bar:1-smtp - TCP, ports 1 through <u>smtp</u>, host bar
                     :time - either TCP, UDP or UDPLITE time service port

       <b>-K</b> <u>k</u>     selects  the  listing of tasks (threads) of processes, on dialects where task (thread) reporting
                is supported.  (If help output - i.e., the output of the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b>  options - shows this  option,
                then task (thread) reporting is supported by the dialect.)

                If  <b>-K</b>  is  followed  by  a  value,  <u>k</u>,  it  must  be  ``i''.  That causes <u>lsof</u> to ignore tasks,
                particularly in the default, list-everything case when no other options are specified.

                When <b>-K</b> and <b>-a</b> are both specified on Linux, and the tasks of a  main  process  are  selected  by
                other options, the main process will also be listed as though it were a task, but without a task
                ID.  (See the description of the TID column in the <b>OUTPUT</b> section.)

                Where the FreeBSD version supports threads, all threads will be listed with their IDs.

                In  general  threads  and  tasks  inherit  the  files of the caller, but may close some and open
                others, so <u>lsof</u> always reports all the open files of threads and tasks.

       <b>-k</b> <u>k</u>     specifies a kernel name list file, <u>k</u>, in place of /vmunix, /mach,  etc.   <b>-k</b>  is  not  available
                under AIX on the IBM RISC/System 6000.

       <b>-l</b>       inhibits  the  conversion  of user ID numbers to login names.  It is also useful when login name
                lookup is working improperly or slowly.

       <b>+|-L</b> <u>[l]</u> enables (`+') or disables (`-') the listing of file link counts,  where  they  are  available  -
                e.g., they aren't available for sockets, or most FIFOs and pipes.

                When  <b>+L</b>  is  specified  without a following number, all link counts will be listed.  When <b>-L</b> is
                specified (the default), no link counts will be listed.

                When <b>+L</b> is followed by a number, only files having a link count less than that  number  will  be
                listed.   (No number may follow <b>-L</b>.)  A specification of the form ``<b>+L1</b>'' will select open files
                that have been unlinked.   A  specification  of  the  form  ``<b>+aL1</b> <u>&lt;file_system&gt;</u>''  will  select
                unlinked open files on the specified file system.

                For other link count comparisons, use field output (<b>-F</b>) and a post-processing script or program.

       <b>+|-m</b> <u>m</u>   specifies an alternate kernel memory file or activates mount table supplement processing.

                The  option  form  <b>-m</b>  <u>m</u>  specifies a kernel memory file, <u>m</u>, in place of <u>/dev/kmem</u> or <u>/dev/mem</u> -
                e.g., a crash dump file.

                The option form <b>+m</b> requests that a mount supplement file be written to the standard output file.
                All other options are silently ignored.

                There will be a line in the mount supplement file for each mounted file system,  containing  the
                mounted  file  system  directory,  followed  by a single space, followed by the device number in
                hexadecimal "0x" format - e.g.,

                     / 0x801

                <u>Lsof</u> can use the mount supplement file to get device numbers for file systems when it can't  get
                them via <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) or <u><a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a></u>(2).

                The option form <b>+m</b> <u>m</u> identifies <u>m</u> as a mount supplement file.

                Note: the <b>+m</b> and <b>+m</b> <u>m</u> options are not available for all supported dialects.  Check the output of
                <u>lsof's</u> <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b>  options to see if the <b>+m</b> and <b>+m</b> <u>m</u> options are available.

       <b>+|-M</b>     Enables  (<b>+</b>)  or  disables  (<b>-</b>) the reporting of portmapper registrations for local TCP, UDP and
                UDPLITE ports, where port mapping  is  supported.   (See  the  last  paragraph  of  this  option
                description for information about where portmapper registration reporting is supported.)

                The  default  reporting  mode  is set by the <u>lsof</u> builder with the HASPMAPENABLED #define in the
                dialect's  machine.h  header  file;  <u>lsof</u>  is  distributed  with  the   HASPMAPENABLED   #define
                deactivated,  so  portmapper  reporting  is  disabled  by default and must be requested with <b>+M</b>.
                Specifying <u>lsof's</u> <b>-h</b>  or  <b>-?</b>   option  will  report  the  default  mode.   Disabling  portmapper
                registration  when  it  is  already  disabled or enabling it when already enabled is acceptable.
                When portmapper registration reporting is enabled, <u>lsof</u> displays the portmapper registration (if
                any) for local TCP, UDP or UDPLITE ports in  square  brackets  immediately  following  the  port
                numbers  or  service  names  -  e.g.,  ``:1234[name]''  or  ``:name[100083]''.  The registration
                information may be a name or number, depending on what the registering program supplied  to  the
                portmapper when it registered the port.

                When  portmapper  registration  reporting  is enabled, <u>lsof</u> may run a little more slowly or even
                become blocked when access  to  the  portmapper  becomes  congested  or  stopped.   Reverse  the
                reporting mode to determine if portmapper registration reporting is slowing or blocking <u>lsof</u>.

                For  purposes  of  portmapper  registration  reporting <u>lsof</u> considers a TCP, UDP or UDPLITE port
                local if: it is found in the local part of its containing kernel structure; or if it is  located
                in  the  foreign  part  of  its  containing  kernel structure and the local and foreign Internet
                addresses are the same; or if it is located  in  the  foreign  part  of  its  containing  kernel
                structure  and  the foreign Internet address is INADDR_LOOPBACK (127.0.0.1).  This rule may make
                <u>lsof</u> ignore some foreign ports on machines with multiple interfaces when  the  foreign  Internet
                address is on a different interface from the local one.

                See  the  <u>lsof</u>  FAQ  (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.)  for further discussion of portmapper
                registration reporting issues.

                Portmapper registration reporting is supported only on dialects  that  have  RPC  header  files.
                (Some  Linux  distributions  with  GlibC  2.14  do not have them.)  When portmapper registration
                reporting is supported, the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b>  help output will show the <b>+|-M</b> option.

       <b>-n</b>       inhibits the conversion of  network  numbers  to  host  names  for  network  files.   Inhibiting
                conversion  may  make  <u>lsof</u>  run faster.  It is also useful when host name lookup is not working
                properly.

       <b>-N</b>       selects the listing of NFS files.

       <b>-o</b>       directs <u>lsof</u> to display file offset at all times.  It causes the SIZE/OFF output column title to
                be changed to OFFSET.  Note: on some UNIX dialects <u>lsof</u> can't obtain accurate or consistent file
                offset information from its kernel data sources, sometimes just for particular  kinds  of  files
                (e.g.,  socket  files.)   Consult  the  <u>lsof</u> FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.)  for more
                information.

                The <b>-o</b> and <b>-s</b> options are mutually exclusive; they can't both be  specified.   When  neither  is
                specified,  <u>lsof</u> displays whatever value - size or offset - is appropriate and available for the
                type of the file.

       <b>-o</b> <u>o</u>     defines the number of decimal digits (<u>o</u>) to be printed after the ``0t'' for a file offset before
                the form is switched to ``0x...''.  An <u>o</u> value of zero  (unlimited)  directs  <u>lsof</u>  to  use  the
                ``0t'' form for all offset output.

                This  option does NOT direct <u>lsof</u> to display offset at all times; specify <b>-o</b> (without a trailing
                number) to do that.  <b>-o</b> <u>o</u> only specifies the number of digits after ``0t'' in either mixed  size
                and  offset  or  offset-only output.  Thus, for example, to direct <u>lsof</u> to display offset at all
                times with a decimal digit count of 10, use:

                     -o -o 10
                or
                     -oo10

                The default number of digits allowed after ``0t'' is normally 8, but may have  been  changed  by
                the  lsof  builder.   Consult  the  description of the <b>-o</b> <u>o</u> option in the output of the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b>
                option to determine the default that is in effect.

       <b>-O</b>       directs <u>lsof</u> to bypass the strategy it uses to avoid being blocked by some kernel  operations  -
                i.e.,  doing  them  in  forked child processes.  See the <b>BLOCKS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TIMEOUTS</b> and <b>AVOIDING</b> <b>KERNEL</b>
                <b>BLOCKS</b> sections for more information on kernel operations that may block <u>lsof</u>.

                While use of this option will reduce <u>lsof</u> startup overhead, it may also cause <u>lsof</u> to hang  when
                the kernel doesn't respond to a function.  Use this option cautiously.

       <b>-p</b> <u>s</u>     excludes or selects the listing of files for the processes whose optional process IDentification
                (PID)  numbers  are in the comma-separated set <u>s</u> - e.g., ``123'' or ``123,^456''.  (There should
                be no spaces in the set.)

                PID numbers that begin with `^' (negation) represent exclusions.

                Multiple process ID numbers are joined in a single ORed set before participating in  AND  option
                selection.   However,  PID exclusions are applied without ORing or ANDing and take effect before
                other selection criteria are applied.

       <b>-P</b>       inhibits the conversion of port numbers to port names for network files (the mapping is commonly
                learned from <a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a>).  Inhibiting the conversion may make <u>lsof</u> run a little  faster.   It
                is also useful when port name lookup is not working properly.

       <b>-Q</b>       ignore  failed  search terms. When <u>lsof</u> is told to search for users of a file, or for users of a
                device, or for a specific PID, or for certain protocols in use by that PID, and so on, <u>lsof</u> will
                return an error if any of the search results are empty. The <b>-Q</b> option will change this  behavior
                so  that  <u>lsof</u>  will instead return a successful exit code (0) even if any of the search results
                are empty. In addition, missing search terms will not be reported to stderr.

       <b>+|-r</b> <u>[t[c&lt;N&gt;][m&lt;fmt&gt;]]</u>
                puts <u>lsof</u> in repeat mode.  There <u>lsof</u> lists open files as selected by other  options,  delays  <u>t</u>
                seconds  (default  fifteen),  then  repeats the listing, delaying and listing repetitively until
                stopped by a condition defined by the prefix to the option.

                If the prefix is a `-', repeat mode is endless.  <u>Lsof</u> must be terminated with  an  interrupt  or
                quit  signal.   `c&lt;N&gt;'  is  for  specifying the limits of repeating; if the number of iterations
                reaches at `&lt;N&gt;', <u>Lsof</u> stops itself.

                If the prefix is `+', repeat mode will end the first cycle no open files are  listed  -  and  of
                course  when <u>lsof</u> is stopped with an interrupt or quit signal.  When repeat mode ends because no
                files are listed, the process exit code will be zero if any open files were ever listed; one, if
                none were ever listed.

                <u>Lsof</u> marks the end of each listing: if field output is in progress  (the  <b>-F</b>,  option  has  been
                specified), the default marker is `m'; otherwise the default marker is ``========''.  The marker
                is followed by a NL character.

                The  optional  "m&lt;fmt&gt;"  argument  specifies a format for the marker line.  The &lt;fmt&gt; characters
                following `m' are interpreted as a format specification to the <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></u>(3) function,  when  both
                it  and  the  <u><a href="../man3/localtime.3.html">localtime</a></u>(3)  function  are  available  in  the  dialect's C library.  Consult the
                <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></u>(3) documentation for what may appear in its format specification.  Note that when field
                output is requested with the <b>-F</b> option, &lt;fmt&gt; cannot contain the NL format, ``%n''.   Note  also
                that  when  &lt;fmt&gt;  contains spaces or other characters that affect the shell's interpretation of
                arguments, &lt;fmt&gt; must be quoted appropriately.

                Repeat mode reduces <u>lsof</u> startup overhead, so it is more efficient to use this mode than to call
                <u>lsof</u> repetitively from a shell script, for example.

                To use repeat mode most efficiently, accompany <b>+|-r</b> with specification of other  <u>lsof</u>  selection
                options,  so  the  amount  of kernel memory access <u>lsof</u> does will be kept to a minimum.  Options
                that filter at the process level - e.g., <b>-c</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-p</b>, <b>-u</b> - are the most efficient selectors.

                Repeat mode is useful when coupled with field output (see the  <b>-F</b>,  option  description)  and  a
                supervising <u>awk</u> or <u>Perl</u> script, or a C program.

       <b>-R</b>       directs lsof to list the Parent Process IDentification number in the PPID column.

       <b>-s</b> <u>[p:s]</u> <b>s</b>  alone  directs  <u>lsof</u> to display file size at all times.  It causes the SIZE/OFF output column
                title to be changed to SIZE.  If the file does not have a size, nothing is displayed.

                The optional <b>-s</b> <u>p:s</u> form is available only for selected dialects, and only when  the  <b>-h</b>  or  <b>-?</b>
                help output lists it.

                When the optional form is available, the <b>s</b> may be followed by a protocol name (<u>p</u>), either TCP or
                UDP,  a  colon  (`:') and a comma-separated protocol state name list, the option causes open TCP
                and UDP files to be excluded if their state name(s) are in the list (<u>s</u>) preceded by  a  `^';  or
                included if their name(s) are not preceded by a `^'.

                Dialects  that  support this option may support only one protocol.  When an unsupported protocol
                is specified, a  message  will  be  displayed  indicating  state  names  for  the  protocol  are
                unavailable.

                When  an  inclusion  list  is  defined,  only network files with state names in the list will be
                present in the <u>lsof</u> output.  Thus, specifying one state name means that only network files  with
                that lone state name will be listed.

                Case  is  unimportant  in  the protocol or state names, but there may be no spaces and the colon
                (`:') separating the protocol name (<u>p</u>) and the state name list (<u>s</u>) is required.

                If only TCP and UDP files are to be listed,  as  controlled  by  the  specified  exclusions  and
                inclusions,  the  <b>-i</b> option must be specified, too.  If only a single protocol's files are to be
                listed, add its name as an argument to the <b>-i</b> option.

                For example, to list only network files with TCP state LISTEN, use:

                     -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN

                Or, for example, to list network files with all UDP states except Idle, use:

                     -iUDP -sUDP:^Idle

                State names vary with UNIX dialects, so it's not possible to  provide  a  complete  list.   Some
                common  TCP  state  names  are:  CLOSED,  IDLE,  BOUND, LISTEN, ESTABLISHED, SYN_SENT, SYN_RCDV,
                ESTABLISHED, CLOSE_WAIT, FIN_WAIT1, CLOSING, LAST_ACK, FIN_WAIT_2, and  TIME_WAIT.   Two  common
                UDP state names are Unbound and Idle.

                See  the  <u>lsof</u>  FAQ  (The  <b>FAQ</b>  section gives its location.)  for more information on how to use
                protocol state exclusion and inclusion, including examples.

                The <b>-o</b> (without a following decimal digit count) and <b>-s</b> option (without a following protocol and
                state name list) are mutually  exclusive;  they  can't  both  be  specified.   When  neither  is
                specified,  <u>lsof</u> displays whatever value - size or offset - is appropriate and available for the
                type of file.

                Since some types of files don't have true sizes - sockets, FIFOs, pipes, etc.  -  lsof  displays
                for their sizes the content amounts in their associated kernel buffers, if possible.

       <b>-S</b> <u>[t]</u>   specifies  an  optional time-out seconds value for kernel functions - <u><a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a></u>(2), <u><a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink</a></u>(2), and
                <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) - that might otherwise deadlock.  The minimum for <u>t</u> is two; the default,  fifteen;  when
                no value is specified, the default is used.

                See the <b>BLOCKS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TIMEOUTS</b> section for more information.

       <b>-T</b> <u>[t]</u>   controls  the  reporting of some TCP/TPI information, also reported by <u><a href="../man1/netstat.1.html">netstat</a></u>(1), following the
                network addresses.  In normal output the information appears in parentheses,  each  item  except
                TCP  or  TPI  state  name  identified  by a keyword, followed by `=', separated from others by a
                single space:

                     &lt;TCP or TPI state name&gt;
                     QR=&lt;read queue length&gt;
                     QS=&lt;send queue length&gt;
                     SO=&lt;socket options and values&gt;
                     SS=&lt;socket states&gt;
                     TF=&lt;TCP flags and values&gt;
                     WR=&lt;window read length&gt;
                     WW=&lt;window write length&gt;

                Not all values are reported for all UNIX dialects.  Items values (when available)  are  reported
                after the item name and '='.

                When the field output mode is in effect (See <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b>.)  each item appears as a
                field with a `T' leading character.

                <b>-T</b> with no following key characters disables TCP/TPI information reporting.

                <b>-T</b> with following characters selects the reporting of specific TCP/TPI information:

                     <b>f</b>    selects reporting of socket options,
                          states and values, and TCP flags and
                          values.
                     <b>q</b>    selects queue length reporting.
                     <b>s</b>    selects connection state reporting.
                     <b>w</b>    selects window size reporting.

                Not  all  selections are enabled for some UNIX dialects.  State may be selected for all dialects
                and is reported by default.  The <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b>   help  output  for  the  <b>-T</b>  option  will  show  what
                selections may be used with the UNIX dialect.

                When <b>-T</b> is used to select information - i.e., it is followed by one or more selection characters
                -  the  displaying  of state is disabled by default, and it must be explicitly selected again in
                the characters following <b>-T</b>.  (In effect, then, the default is equivalent to <b>-Ts</b>.)  For example,
                if queue lengths and state are desired, use <b>-Tqs</b>.

                Socket options, socket states, some socket values, TCP flags and one TCP value may  be  reported
                (when  available  in  the UNIX dialect) in the form of the names that commonly appear after SO_,
                so_,  SS_,  TCP_   and  TF_  in  the  dialect's  header  files  -  most  often   &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;,
                &lt;sys/socketvar.h&gt;  and  &lt;netinet/tcp_var.h&gt;.   Consult those header files for the meaning of the
                flags, options, states and values.

                ``SO='' precedes socket options and values; ``SS='', socket states; and ``TF='', TCP  flags  and
                values.

                If  a  flag  or  option  has  a  value,  the  value  will  follow  an  '=' and the name -- e.g.,
                ``SO=LINGER=5'', ``SO=QLIM=5'', ``TF=MSS=512''.  The following seven values may be reported:

                     Name
                     Reported  Description (Common Symbol)

                     KEEPALIVE keep alive time (SO_KEEPALIVE)
                     LINGER    linger time (SO_LINGER)
                     MSS       maximum segment size (TCP_MAXSEG)
                     PQLEN          partial listen queue connections
                     QLEN      established listen queue connections

                     RCVBUF    receive buffer length (SO_RCVBUF)
                     SNDBUF    send buffer length (SO_SNDBUF)

                Details on what socket options and values, socket states,  and  TCP  flags  and  values  may  be
                displayed  for  particular  UNIX  dialects  may be found in the answer to the ``Why doesn't lsof
                report socket options, socket states, and TCP flags and  values  for  my  dialect?''  and  ``Why
                doesn't  lsof  report  the partial listen queue connection count for my dialect?''  questions in
                the <u>lsof</u> FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.)  On Linux this option also prints  the  state
                of UNIX domain sockets.

       <b>-t</b>       produce  terse output comprising only process identifiers (without a header), so that it is easy
                to use programmatically. e.g.

                     # reload anything using old SSL
                     lsof -t <a href="file:/lib/">/lib/</a>*/libssl.so.* | xargs -r kill -HUP

                     # get list of processes and then iterate over them (Bash only)
                     mapfile -t pids &lt; &lt;(
                         lsof -wt /var/log/your.log
                     )
                     for pid in "${pids[@]}" ; do
                         your_command -p "$pid"
                     done

                The <b>-t</b> option implies the <b>-w</b> option.

       <b>-u</b> <u>s</u>     selects the listing of files for the user whose login names  or  user  ID  numbers  are  in  the
                comma-separated set <u>s</u> - e.g., ``abe'', or ``548,root''.  (There should be no spaces in the set.)

                Multiple  login names or user ID numbers are joined in a single ORed set before participating in
                AND option selection.

                If a login name or user ID is preceded by a  `^',  it  becomes  a  negation  -  i.e.,  files  of
                processes owned by the login name or user ID will never be listed.  A negated login name or user
                ID  selection  is  neither  ANDed nor ORed with other selections; it is applied before all other
                selections and absolutely excludes the listing of the files of the  process.   For  example,  to
                direct  <u>lsof</u> to exclude the listing of files belonging to root processes, specify ``-u^root'' or
                ``-u^0''.

       <b>-U</b>       selects the listing of UNIX domain socket files.

       <b>-v</b>       selects the listing of <u>lsof</u> version information,  including:  revision  number;  when  the  <u>lsof</u>
                binary  was  constructed; who constructed the binary and where; the name of the compiler used to
                construct the <u>lsof</u> <u>binary;</u> the version number  of  the  compiler  when  readily  available;  the
                compiler  and  loader flags used to construct the <u>lsof</u> binary; and system information, typically
                the output of <u>uname</u>'s <b>-a</b> option.

       <b>-V</b>       directs <u>lsof</u> to indicate the items it was asked to list and failed to find - command names, file
                names, Internet addresses or files, login names, NFS files, PIDs, PGIDs, and UIDs.

                When other options are ANDed to search options, or compile-time options restrict the listing  of
                some  files,  <u>lsof</u>  may  not report that it failed to find a search item when an ANDed option or
                compile-time option prevents the listing of the open file containing the located search item.

                For example, ``lsof -V -iTCP@foobar -a -d 999'' may not report a failure to locate open files at
                ``TCP@foobar'' and may not list any, if none have a file descriptor number of  999.   A  similar
                situation  arises  when  HASSECURITY  and HASNOSOCKSECURITY are defined at compile time and they
                prevent the listing of open files.

       <b>+|-w</b>     Enables (<b>+</b>) or disables (<b>-</b>) the suppression of warning messages.

                The <u>lsof</u> builder may choose to have warning  messages  disabled  or  enabled  by  default.   The
                default  warning  message  state  is indicated in the output of the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b>  option.  Disabling
                warning messages when they are already  disabled  or  enabling  them  when  already  enabled  is
                acceptable.

                The <b>-t</b> option implies the <b>-w</b> option.

       <b>-x</b> <u>[fl]</u>  may  accompany  the  <b>+d</b>  and  <b>+D</b> options to direct their processing to cross over symbolic links
                and|or file system mount points encountered when scanning the directory (<b>+d</b>) or  directory  tree
                (<b>+D</b>).

                If  <b>-x</b>  is  specified  by  itself  without  a following parameter, cross-over processing of both
                symbolic links and file system mount points is enabled.  Note that when <b>-x</b> is specified  without
                a parameter, the next argument must begin with '-' or '+'.

                The  optional 'f' parameter enables file system mount point cross-over processing; 'l', symbolic
                link cross-over processing.

                The <b>-x</b> option may not be supplied without also supplying a <b>+d</b> or <b>+D</b> option.

       <b>-X</b>       This is a dialect-specific option.

           AIX:
                This IBM AIX RISC/System 6000 option requests the reporting of executed  text  file  and  shared
                library references.

                <b>WARNING:</b>  because  this  option  uses  the kernel readx() function, its use on a busy AIX system
                might cause an application process to hang so completely that  it  can  neither  be  killed  nor
                stopped.  I have never seen this happen or had a report of its happening, but I think there is a
                remote possibility it could happen.

                By default use of readx() is disabled.  On AIX 5L and above <u>lsof</u> may need setuid-root permission
                to perform the actions this option requests.

                The  <u>lsof</u>  builder  may  specify that the <b>-X</b> option be restricted to processes whose real UID is
                root.  If that has been done, the <b>-X</b> option will not appear in the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b>  help output  unless
                the  real  UID  of  the  <u>lsof</u>  process is root.  The default <u>lsof</u> distribution allows any UID to
                specify <b>-X,</b> so by default it will appear in the help output.

                When AIX readx() use is disabled, <u>lsof</u> may not be able to report information for  all  text  and
                loader file references, but it may also avoid exacerbating an AIX kernel directory search kernel
                error, known as the Stale Segment ID bug.

                The  readx()  function,  used  by  <u>lsof</u>  or  any other program to access some sections of kernel
                virtual memory, can trigger the Stale Segment ID bug.  It can cause  the  kernel's  dir_search()
                function  to  believe  erroneously that part of an in-memory copy of a file system directory has
                been zeroed.  Another application process, distinct from <u>lsof</u>, asking the kernel to  search  the
                directory  -  e.g.,  by using <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) - can cause dir_search() to loop forever, thus hanging the
                application process.

                Consult the <u>lsof</u> FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.)  and the <u>00README</u> file  of  the  <u>lsof</u>
                distribution  for a more complete description of the Stale Segment ID bug, its APAR, and methods
                for defining readx() use when compiling <u>lsof</u>.

           Linux:
                This Linux option requests that <u>lsof</u> skip the reporting of information on all open TCP, UDP  and
                UDPLITE IPv4 and IPv6 files.

                This  Linux option is most useful when the system has an extremely large number of open TCP, UDP
                and UDPLITE files, the processing of whose information in the <u><a href="file:/proc/net/tcp">/proc/net/tcp</a>*</u> and  <u><a href="file:/proc/net/udp">/proc/net/udp</a>*</u>
                files would take <u>lsof</u> a long time, and whose reporting is not of interest.

                Use  this  option  with  care  and  only when you are sure that the information you want <u>lsof</u> to
                display isn't associated with open TCP, UDP or UDPLITE socket files.

           Solaris 10 and above:
                This Solaris 10 and above option requests the reporting of cached paths for files that have been
                deleted - i.e., removed with <u><a href="../man1/rm.1.html">rm</a></u>(1) or <u><a href="../man2/unlink.2.html">unlink</a></u>(2).

                The cached path is followed by the string `` (deleted)'' to indicate that the path by which  the
                file was opened has been deleted.

                Because  intervening  changes made to the path - i.e., renames with <u><a href="../man1/mv.1.html">mv</a></u>(1) or <u><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></u>(2) - are not
                recorded in the cached path, what <u>lsof</u> reports is only the path by which the  file  was  opened,
                not its possibly different final path.

       <b>-z</b> <u>[z]</u>   specifies how Solaris 10 and higher zone information is to be handled.

                Without  a  following  argument  -  e.g.,  NO <u>z</u> - the option specifies that zone names are to be
                listed in the ZONE output column.

                The <b>-z</b> option may be followed by a zone name, <b>z</b><u>.</u>  That causes lsof to list only open  files  for
                processes in that zone.  Multiple <b>-z</b> <u>z</u> option and argument pairs may be specified to form a list
                of  named  zones.   Any  open file of any process in any of the zones will be listed, subject to
                other conditions specified by other options and arguments.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>[Z]</u>   specifies how SELinux security contexts are to be handled.  It and 'Z'  field  output  character
                support  are  inhibited  when  SELinux  is disabled in the running Linux kernel.  See <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FOR</b>
                <b>OTHER</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b> for more information on the 'Z' field output character.

                Without a following argument - e.g., NO <u>Z</u> - the option specifies that security contexts  are  to
                be listed in the SECURITY-CONTEXT output column.

                The  <b>-Z</b> option may be followed by a wildcard security context name, <b>Z</b><u>.</u>  That causes lsof to list
                only open files for processes in that security context.  Multiple <b>-Z</b> <u>Z</u> option and argument pairs
                may be specified to form a list of security contexts.  Any open file of any process  in  any  of
                the security contexts will be listed, subject to other conditions specified by other options and
                arguments.   Note  that  <u>Z</u>  can  be  A:B:C or *:B:C or A:B:* or *:*:C to match against the A:B:C
                context.

       <b>--</b>       The double minus sign option is a marker that signals the end of the keyed options.  It  may  be
                used,  for example, when the first file name begins with a minus sign.  It may also be used when
                the absence of a value for the last keyed option must be signified by the presence  of  a  minus
                sign in the following option and before the start of the file names.

       <u>names</u>    These  are  path  names of specific files to list.  Symbolic links are resolved before use.  The
                first name may be separated from the preceding options with the ``--'' option.

                If a <u>name</u> is the mounted-on directory of a file system or the device of the  file  system,  <u>lsof</u>
                will  list all the files open on the file system.  To be considered a file system, the <u>name</u> must
                match a mounted-on directory name in <u><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></u>(8) output, or  match  the  name  of  a  block  device
                associated  with  a  mounted-on  directory  name.   The <b>+|-f</b> option may be used to force <u>lsof</u> to
                consider a <u>name</u> a file system identifier (<b>+f</b>) or a simple file (<b>-f</b>).

                If <u>name</u> is a path to a directory that is not the mounted-on directory name of a file system,  it
                is treated just as a regular file is treated - i.e., its listing is restricted to processes that
                have  it  open as a file or as a process-specific directory, such as the root or current working
                directory.  To request that <u>lsof</u> look for open files inside a directory name, use the <b>+d</b>  <u>s</u>  and
                <b>+D</b> <u>D</u> options.

                If a <u>name</u> is the base name of a family of multiplexed files - e.g, AIX's <u>/dev/pt[cs]</u> - <u>lsof</u> will
                list  all  the  associated  multiplexed files on the device that are open - e.g., <u>/dev/pt[cs]/1</u>,
                <u>/dev/pt[cs]/2</u>, etc.

                If a <u>name</u> is a UNIX domain socket name, <u>lsof</u> will usually search for it by the characters of the
                name alone - exactly as it is specified and is recorded in the kernel  socket  structure.   (See
                the next paragraph for an exception to that rule for Linux.)  Specifying a relative path - e.g.,
                <u>./file</u>  -  in place of the file's absolute path - e.g., <u>/tmp/file</u> - won't work because <u>lsof</u> must
                match the characters you specify with what it finds in the kernel UNIX domain socket structures.

                If a <u>name</u> is a Linux UNIX domain socket name, in one case <u>lsof</u> is able to search for it  by  its
                device  and  inode  number,  allowing  <u>name</u>  to  be a relative path.  The case requires that the
                absolute path -- i.e., one beginning with a slash ('/') be used by the process that created  the
                socket,  and  hence  be  stored in the <u><a href="file:/proc/net/unix">/proc/net/unix</a></u> file; and it requires that <u>lsof</u> be able to
                obtain the device and node numbers of both the absolute path  in  <u><a href="file:/proc/net/unix">/proc/net/unix</a></u>  and  <u>name</u>  via
                successful <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) system calls.  When those conditions are met, <u>lsof</u> will be able to search for
                the  UNIX domain socket when some path to it is is specified in <u>name</u>.  Thus, for example, if the
                path is <u>/dev/log</u>, and an <u>lsof</u> search is initiated when the working directory is <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u>, then  <u>name</u>
                could be <u>./log</u>.

                If  a <u>name</u> is none of the above, <u>lsof</u> will list any open files whose device and inode match that
                of the specified path <u>name</u>.

                If you have also specified the <b>-b</b> option, the only <u>names</u> you may safely specify are file systems
                for which your mount table supplies alternate device numbers.  See the  <b>AVOIDING</b>  <b>KERNEL</b>  <b>BLOCKS</b>
                and <b>ALTERNATE</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>NUMBERS</b> sections for more information.

                Multiple  file  names  are  joined  in  a  single  ORed  set  before participating in AND option
                selection.

</pre><h4><b>AFS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Lsof</u> supports the recognition of AFS files for these dialects (and AFS versions):

            AIX 4.1.4 (AFS 3.4a)
            HP-UX 9.0.5 (AFS 3.4a)
            Linux 1.2.13 (AFS 3.3)
            Solaris 2.[56] (AFS 3.4a)

       It may recognize AFS files on other versions of these dialects, but has not been tested there.  Depending
       on how AFS is implemented, <u>lsof</u> may recognize AFS files in  other  dialects,  or  may  have  difficulties
       recognizing AFS files in the supported dialects.

       <u>Lsof</u>  may have trouble identifying all aspects of AFS files in supported dialects when AFS kernel support
       is implemented via dynamic modules whose addresses do not appear in the kernel's variable name list.   In
       that  case,  <u>lsof</u>  may have to guess at the identity of AFS files, and might not be able to obtain volume
       information from the kernel that is needed for calculating AFS volume  node  numbers.   When  <u>lsof</u>  can't
       compute volume node numbers, it reports blank in the NODE column.

       The  <b>-A</b>  <u>A</u>  option is available in some dialect implementations of <u>lsof</u> for specifying the name list file
       where dynamic module kernel addresses may be found.  When this option is available, it will be listed  in
       the <u>lsof</u> help output, presented in response to the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b>

       See the <u>lsof</u> FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.)  for more information about dynamic modules, their
       symbols, and how they affect <u>lsof</u> options.

       Because  AFS  path  lookups  don't  seem to participate in the kernel's name cache operations, <u>lsof</u> can't
       identify path name components for AFS files.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Lsof</u> has three features that may cause security concerns.  First, its  default  compilation  mode  allows
       anyone  to  list all open files with it.  Second, by default it creates a user-readable and user-writable
       device cache file in the home directory of the real user ID that executes <u>lsof</u>.  (The list-all-open-files
       and device cache features may be disabled when <u>lsof</u> is compiled.)  Third, its  <b>-k</b>  and  <b>-m</b>  options  name
       alternate kernel name list or memory files.

       Restricting   the  listing  of  all  open  files  is  controlled  by  the  compile-time  HASSECURITY  and
       HASNOSOCKSECURITY options.  When HASSECURITY is defined, <u>lsof</u> will allow only the root user to  list  all
       open  files.   The  non-root user may list only open files of processes with the same user IDentification
       number as the real user ID number of the <u>lsof</u> process (the one that its user logged on with).

       However, if HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECURITY are both  defined,  anyone  may  list  open  socket  files,
       provided they are selected with the <b>-i</b> option.

       When HASSECURITY is not defined, anyone may list all open files.

       Help  output,  presented  in  response  to  the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b>  option, gives the status of the HASSECURITY and
       HASNOSOCKSECURITY definitions.

       See the <b>Security</b> section of the <u>00README</u> file of the <u>lsof</u> distribution for information on  building  <u>lsof</u>
       with the HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECURITY options enabled.

       Creation and use of a user-readable and user-writable device cache file is controlled by the compile-time
       HASDCACHE  option.   See the <b>DEVICE</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>FILE</b> section and the sections that follow it for details on how
       its path is formed.  For security considerations it is  important  to  note  that  in  the  default  <u>lsof</u>
       distribution,  if  the  real  user ID under which <u>lsof</u> is executed is root, the device cache file will be
       written in root's home directory - e.g., <u>/</u> or <u><a href="file:/root">/root</a></u>.  When HASDCACHE is not defined, <u>lsof</u> does not  write
       or attempt to read a device cache file.

       When  HASDCACHE  is  defined, the <u>lsof</u> help output, presented in response to the <b>-h</b>, <b>-D?</b>, or <b>-?</b>  options,
       will provide device cache file handling information.  When HASDCACHE is not defined, the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b>  output
       will have no <b>-D</b> option description.

       Before you decide to disable the device cache file feature - enabling it improves the performance of <u>lsof</u>
       by reducing the startup overhead of examining all the nodes in <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> (or <u>/devices</u>) - read  the  discussion
       of  it  in  the  <u>00DCACHE</u>  file  of  the  <u>lsof</u>  distribution  and the <u>lsof</u> FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its
       location.)

       WHEN IN DOUBT, YOU CAN TEMPORARILY DISABLE THE USE OF THE DEVICE CACHE FILE WITH THE <b>-Di</b> OPTION.

       When <u>lsof</u> user declares alternate kernel name list or memory files with  the  <b>-k</b>  and  <b>-m</b>  options,  <u>lsof</u>
       checks  the  user's  authority to read them with <u><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></u>(2).  This is intended to prevent whatever special
       power <u>lsof's</u> modes might confer on it from  letting  it  read  files  not  normally  accessible  via  the
       authority of the real user ID.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       This  section describes the information <u>lsof</u> lists for each open file.  See the <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b>
       section for additional information on output that can be processed by another program.

       <u>Lsof</u> only outputs printable (declared so by <u><a href="../man3/isprint.3.html">isprint</a></u>(3)) 8 bit characters.  Non-printable  characters  are
       printed in one of three forms: the C ``\[bfrnt]'' form; the control character `^' form (e.g., ``^@''); or
       hexadecimal  leading  ``\x''  form  (e.g.,  ``\xab'').   Space  is  non-printable  in  the COMMAND column
       (``\x20'') and printable elsewhere.

       For some dialects - if HASSETLOCALE is defined in the dialect's machine.h header file - <u>lsof</u>  will  print
       the  extended 8 bit characters of a language locale.  The <u>lsof</u> process must be supplied a language locale
       environment variable (e.g., LANG) whose value represents a known language locale in  which  the  extended
       characters are considered printable by <u><a href="../man3/isprint.3.html">isprint</a></u>(3).  Otherwise <u>lsof</u> considers the extended characters non-
       printable  and  prints  them  according to its rules for non-printable characters, stated above.  Consult
       your dialect's <u><a href="../man3/setlocale.3.html">setlocale</a></u>(3) man page for the names of other environment variables that  may  be  used  in
       place of LANG - e.g., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, etc.

       <u>Lsof's</u>  language  locale  support  for  a  dialect  also  covers  wide  characters  -  e.g., UTF-8 - when
       HASSETLOCALE and HASWIDECHAR are defined in the dialect's machine.h header  file,  and  when  a  suitable
       language  locale  has  been  defined  in the appropriate environment variable for the <u>lsof</u> process.  Wide
       characters are printable under those conditions if <u><a href="../man3/iswprint.3.html">iswprint</a></u>(3) reports  them  to  be.   If  HASSETLOCALE,
       HASWIDECHAR and a suitable language locale aren't defined, or if <u><a href="../man3/iswprint.3.html">iswprint</a></u>(3) reports wide characters that
       aren't  printable,  <u>lsof</u>  considers  the  wide  characters  non-printable and prints each of their 8 bits
       according to its rules for non-printable characters, stated above.

       Consult the answers to the "Language locale support" questions in the lsof FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its
       location.) for more information.

       <u>Lsof</u> dynamically sizes the output columns each time it runs, guaranteeing that each column is  a  minimum
       size.  It also guarantees that each column is separated from its predecessor by at least one space.

       COMMAND    contains  the  first  nine  characters  of  the  name  of the UNIX command associated with the
                  process.  If a non-zero <u>w</u> value is specified to the <b>+c</b> <u>w</u> option, the column contains the first
                  <u>w</u> characters of the name of the UNIX command associated with the process up to  the  limit  of
                  characters  supplied to <u>lsof</u> by the UNIX dialect.  (See the description of the <b>+c</b> <u>w</u> command or
                  the <u>lsof</u> FAQ for more information.  The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.)

                  If <u>w</u> is less than the length of the column title, ``COMMAND'',  it  will  be  raised  to  that
                  length.

                  If  a  zero <u>w</u> value is specified to the <b>+c</b> <u>w</u> option, the column contains all the characters of
                  the name of the UNIX command associated with the process.

                  All command name characters maintained by the kernel in its structures are displayed in  field
                  output when the command name descriptor (`c') is specified.  See the <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
                  section for information on selecting field output and the associated command name descriptor.

       PID        is the Process IDentification number of the process.

       TID        is  the  task  (thread)  IDentification number, if task (thread) reporting is supported by the
                  dialect and a task (thread) is being listed.  (If help output - i.e., the output of the <b>-h</b>  or
                  <b>-?</b>  options - shows this option, then task (thread) reporting is supported by the dialect.)

                  A blank TID column in Linux indicates a process - i.e., a non-task.

       TASKCMD    is the task command name.  Generally this will be the same as the process named in the COMMAND
                  column, but some task implementations (e.g., Linux) permit a task to change its command name.

                  The TASKCMD column width is subject to the same size limitation as the COMMAND column.

       ZONE       is the Solaris 10 and higher zone name.  This column must be selected with the <b>-z</b> option.

       SECURITY-CONTEXT
                  is  the SELinux security context.  This column must be selected with the <b>-Z</b> option.  Note that
                  the <b>-Z</b> option is inhibited when SELinux is disabled in the running Linux kernel.

       PPID       is the Parent Process IDentification number of the process.  It is only displayed when the  <b>-R</b>
                  option has been specified.

       PGID       is  the process group IDentification number associated with the process.  It is only displayed
                  when the <b>-g</b> option has been specified.

       USER       is the user ID number or login name of the user to whom the process belongs, usually the  same
                  as  reported  by  <u><a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a></u>(1).   However, on Linux USER is the user ID number or login that owns the
                  directory in <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> where <u>lsof</u> finds information about the process.  Usually that is  the  same
                  value  reported  by  <u><a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a></u>(1), but may differ when the process has changed its effective user ID.
                  (See the <b>-l</b> option description for information on when a user  ID  number  or  login  name  is
                  displayed.)

       FD         is the File Descriptor number of the file or:

                       <b>v86</b>  VP/ix mapped file;

                  FD is followed by one of these characters, describing the mode under which the file is open:

                       <b>r</b> for read access;
                       <b>w</b> for write access;
                       <b>u</b> for read and write access;
                       space if mode unknown and no lock
                            character follows;
                       `-' if mode unknown and lock
                            character follows.

                  The  mode  character  is followed by one of these lock characters, describing the type of lock
                  applied to the file:

                       <b>N</b> for a Solaris NFS lock of unknown type;
                       <b>r</b> for read lock on part of the file;
                       <b>R</b> for a read lock on the entire file;
                       <b>w</b> for a write lock on part of the file;
                       <b>W</b> for a write lock on the entire file;
                       <b>u</b> for a read and write lock of any length;
                       <b>U</b> for a lock of unknown type;
                       <b>x</b> for an SCO OpenServer Xenix lock on part of the file;
                       <b>X</b> for an SCO OpenServer Xenix lock on the entire file;
                       space if there is no lock.

                  See the <b>LOCKS</b> section for more information on the lock information character.

                  The FD column contents constitutes a single field for parsing in post-processing  scripts.  FD
                  numbers  larger  than 9999 are abbreviated to a ``*'' followed by the last three digits. E.g.,
                  10001 appears as ``*001''

       FILE-ADDR  contains the kernel file structure address when <b>f</b> has been specified to <b>+f</b>;

       FCT        contains  the file reference count from the kernel file structure when <b>c</b> has been specified to
                  <b>+f</b>;

       FILE-FLAG  when <b>g</b> or <b>G</b> has been specified to <b>+f</b>, this field contains the contents of the f_flag[s] member
                  of the kernel file structure and the kernel's per-process open file flags (if available);  `G'
                  causes  them  to  be  displayed  in  hexadecimal;  `g',  as short-hand names; two lists may be
                  displayed with entries separated by commas, the lists separated  by  a  semicolon  (`;');  the

       NODE-ID    (or  INODE-ADDR for some dialects) contains a unique identifier for the file node (usually the
                  kernel vnode or inode address, but also  occasionally  a  concatenation  of  device  and  node
                  number) when <b>n</b> has been specified to <b>+f</b>;

       DEVICE     contains  the  device  numbers,  separated  by commas, for a character special, block special,
                  regular, directory or NFS file;

                  or ``memory'' for a memory file system node under Tru64 UNIX;

                  or the address of the private data area of a Solaris socket stream;

                  or a kernel reference address that identifies the file (The kernel reference  address  may  be
                  used for FIFO's, for example.);

                  or the base address or device name of a Linux AX.25 socket device.

                  Usually only the lower thirty two bits of Tru64 UNIX kernel addresses are displayed.

       SIZE, SIZE/OFF, or OFFSET
                  is the size of the file or the file offset in bytes.  A value is displayed in this column only
                  if  it  is  available.  <u>Lsof</u> displays whatever value - size or offset - is appropriate for the
                  type of the file and the version of <u>lsof</u>.

                  On some UNIX dialects <u>lsof</u> can't obtain accurate or consistent file  offset  information  from
                  its  kernel  data  sources, sometimes just for particular kinds of files (e.g., socket files.)
                  In other cases, files don't have true sizes - e.g., sockets, FIFOs, pipes - so  <u>lsof</u>  displays
                  for  their sizes the content amounts it finds in their kernel buffer descriptors (e.g., socket
                  buffer size counts or TCP/IP window sizes.)  Consult the <u>lsof</u> FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section  gives  its
                  location.)  for more information.

                  The  file  size  is  displayed  in decimal; the offset is normally displayed in decimal with a
                  leading ``0t'' if it contains 8 digits or less; in hexadecimal with a leading ``0x'' if it  is
                  longer  than  8  digits.  (Consult the <b>-o</b> <u>o</u> option description for information on when 8 might
                  default to some other value.)

                  Thus the leading ``0t'' and ``0x'' identify an offset when the column may contain both a  size
                  and an offset (i.e., its title is SIZE/OFF).

                  If  the  <b>-o</b> option is specified, <u>lsof</u> always displays the file offset (or nothing if no offset
                  is available) and labels the column OFFSET.  The offset always begins with ``0t'' or ``0x'' as
                  described above.

                  The <u>lsof</u> user can control the switch from ``0t'' to ``0x'' with the <b>-o</b> <u>o</u> option.  Consult  its
                  description for more information.

                  If  the  <b>-s</b>  option is specified, <u>lsof</u> always displays the file size (or nothing if no size is
                  available) and labels the column SIZE.  The <b>-o</b> and <b>-s</b> options  are  mutually  exclusive;  they
                  can't both be specified.

                  If the <b>-H</b> option is specified, <u>lsof</u> displays file size in human readable form.

                  For  files  that  don't  have  a  fixed size - e.g., don't reside on a disk device - <u>lsof</u> will
                  display appropriate information about the current size or  position  of  the  file  if  it  is
                  available in the kernel structures that define the file.

       NLINK      contains the file link count when <b>+L</b> has been specified;

       NODE       is the node number of a local file;

                  or the inode number of an NFS file in the server host;

                  or the Internet protocol type - e.g, ``TCP'';

                  or ``STR'' for a stream;

                  or ``CCITT'' for an HP-UX x.25 socket;

                  or the IRQ or inode number of a Linux AX.25 socket device.

       NAME       is the name of the mount point and file system on which the file resides;

                  or  the  name  of  a  file  specified  in the <u>names</u> option (after any symbolic links have been
                  resolved);

                  or the name of a character special or block special device;

                  or the local and remote Internet addresses of a network file; the local host name or IP number
                  is followed by a colon (':'), the port, ``-&gt;'', and the two-part remote address; IP  addresses
                  may   be  reported  as  numbers  or  names,  depending  on  the  <b>+|-M</b>,  <b>-n</b>,  and  <b>-P</b>  options;
                  colon-separated IPv6 numbers are  enclosed  in  square  brackets;  IPv4  INADDR_ANY  and  IPv6
                  IN6_IS_ADDR_UNSPECIFIED addresses, and zero port numbers are represented by an asterisk ('*');
                  a  UDP destination address may be followed by the amount of time elapsed since the last packet
                  was sent to the destination; TCP, UDP and UDPLITE remote addresses may be followed by  TCP/TPI
                  information  in parentheses - state (e.g., ``(ESTABLISHED)'', ``(Unbound)''), queue sizes, and
                  window sizes (not all dialects) - in a fashion similar to what <u><a href="../man1/netstat.1.html">netstat</a></u>(1) reports; see the  <b>-T</b>
                  option  description  or  the description of the TCP/TPI field in <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b> for
                  more information on state, queue size, and window size;

                  or the address or name of a UNIX domain socket, possibly including a stream clone device name,
                  a file system object's path name, local and foreign kernel addresses, socket pair information,
                  and a bound vnode address;

                  or the local and remote mount point names of an NFS file;

                  or ``STR'', followed by the stream name;

                  or a stream character device name, followed by ``-&gt;'' and the stream name or a list of  stream
                  module names, separated by ``-&gt;'';

                  or  ``STR:''  followed  by  the  SCO  OpenServer  stream device and module names, separated by
                  ``-&gt;'';

                  or system directory name, `` -- '', and as many components of the path name as <u>lsof</u>  can  find
                  in  the  kernel's name cache for selected dialects (See the <b>KERNEL</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>CACHE</b> section for more
                  information.);

                  or ``PIPE-&gt;'', followed by a Solaris kernel pipe destination address;

                  or ``COMMON:'', followed by the vnode  device  information  structure's  device  name,  for  a
                  Solaris common vnode;

                  or  the  address family, followed by a slash (`/'), followed by fourteen comma-separated bytes
                  of a non-Internet raw socket address;

                  or the HP-UX x.25 local address, followed by the virtual connection number (if any),  followed
                  by the remote address (if any);

                  or  ``(dead)''  for  disassociated  Tru64 UNIX files - typically terminal files that have been
                  flagged with the TIOCNOTTY ioctl and closed by daemons;

                  or ``rd=&lt;offset&gt;'' and ``wr=&lt;offset&gt;'' for the values of the read and write offsets of a FIFO;

                  or ``clone <u>n</u>:/dev/event'' for SCO OpenServer file clones of the <u>/dev/event</u> device, where <u>n</u>  is
                  the minor device number of the file;

                  or  ``(socketpair:  n)''  for  a  Solaris  2.6, 8, 9  or 10 UNIX domain socket, created by the
                  <u><a href="../man3N/socketpair.3N.html">socketpair</a></u>(3N) network function;

                  or ``no PCB'' for socket files that do  not  have  a  protocol  block  associated  with  them,
                  optionally  followed  by ``, CANTSENDMORE'' if sending on the socket has been disabled, or ``,
                  CANTRCVMORE'' if receiving  on  the  socket  has  been  disabled  (e.g.,  by  the  <u><a href="../man2/shutdown.2.html">shutdown</a></u>(2)
                  function);

                  or   the   local   and   remote   addresses   of   a   Linux  IPX  socket  file  in  the  form
                  &lt;net&gt;:[&lt;node&gt;:]&lt;port&gt;, followed in parentheses by the transmit and receive  queue  sizes,  and
                  the connection state;

                  or  ``dgram''  or  ``stream''  for  the  type  UnixWare  7.1.1 and above in-kernel UNIX domain
                  sockets, followed by a colon (':') and the local path name when available, followed by  ``-&gt;''
                  and the remote path name or kernel socket address in hexadecimal when available;

                  or the association value, association index, endpoint value, local address, local port, remote
                  address and remote port for Linux SCTP sockets;

                  or ``protocol: '' followed by the Linux socket's protocol attribute.

       For  dialects  that  support  a  ``namefs'' file system, allowing one file to be attached to another with
       <u><a href="../man3C/fattach.3C.html">fattach</a></u>(3C), <u>lsof</u> will add ``(FA:&lt;address1&gt;&lt;direction&gt;&lt;address2&gt;)'' to the NAME column.   &lt;address1&gt;  and
       &lt;address2&gt; are hexadecimal vnode addresses.  &lt;direction&gt; will be ``&lt;-'' if &lt;address2&gt; has been fattach'ed
       to this vnode whose address is &lt;address1&gt;; and ``-&gt;'' if &lt;address1&gt;, the vnode address of this vnode, has
       been fattach'ed to &lt;address2&gt;.  &lt;address1&gt; may be omitted if it already appears in the DEVICE column.

       <u>Lsof</u>  may  add  two  parenthetical  notes  to  the NAME column for open Solaris 10 files: ``(?)'' if <u>lsof</u>
       considers the path name of questionable accuracy; and ``(deleted)'' if the <b>-X</b> option has  been  specified
       and <u>lsof</u> detects the open file's path name has been deleted.  Consult the <u>lsof</u> FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives
       its location.)  for more information on these NAME column additions.

</pre><h4><b>LOCKS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Lsof</u>  can't adequately report the wide variety of UNIX dialect file locks in a single character.  What it
       reports in a single character is a compromise between the information it finds  in  the  kernel  and  the
       limitations of the reporting format.

       Moreover,  when  a  process holds several byte level locks on a file, <u>lsof</u> only reports the status of the
       first lock it encounters.  If it is a byte level lock, then the lock character will be reported in  lower
       case - i.e., `r', `w', or `x' - rather than the upper case equivalent reported for a full file lock.

       Generally  <u>lsof</u>  can  only  report on locks held by local processes on local files.  When a local process
       sets a lock on a remotely mounted (e.g., NFS) file, the remote  server  host  usually  records  the  lock
       state.   One  exception  is  Solaris  -  at  some patch levels of 2.3, and in all versions above 2.4, the
       Solaris kernel records information on remote locks in local structures.

       <u>Lsof</u> has trouble reporting locks for some UNIX dialects.  Consult the <b>BUGS</b> section of this manual page or
       the <u>lsof</u> FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.)  for more information.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b></h4><pre>
       When the <b>-F</b> option is specified, <u>lsof</u> produces output that is suitable for processing by another  program
       - e.g, an <u>awk</u> or <u>Perl</u> script, or a C program.

       Each  unit of information is output in a field that is identified with a leading character and terminated
       by a NL (012) (or a NUL (000) if the 0 (zero) field identifier character is specified.)  The data of  the
       field follows immediately after the field identification character and extends to the field terminator.

       It  is  possible  to  think  of field output as process and file sets.  A process set begins with a field
       whose identifier is `p' (for process IDentifier (PID)).  It extends to the  beginning  of  the  next  PID
       field  or  the  beginning  of  the first file set of the process, whichever comes first.  Included in the
       process set are fields that identify the command, the process group  IDentification  (PGID)  number,  the
       task (thread) ID (TID), and the user ID (UID) number or login name.

       A  file  set  begins with a field whose identifier is `f' (for file descriptor).  It is followed by lines
       that describe the file's access mode, lock state, type, device, size, offset, inode, protocol,  name  and
       stream module names.  It extends to the beginning of the next file or process set, whichever comes first.

       When  the NUL (000) field terminator has been selected with the 0 (zero) field identifier character, <u>lsof</u>
       ends each process and file set with a NL (012) character.

       <u>Lsof</u> always produces one field, the PID (`p') field.  In repeat mode, the marker (`m') is also  produced.
       All  other  fields  may be declared optionally in the field identifier character list that follows the <b>-F</b>
       option.  When a field selection character identifies an item <u>lsof</u> does not normally list  -  e.g.,  PPID,
       selected with <b>-R</b> - specification of the field character - e.g., ``<b>-FR</b>'' - also selects the listing of the
       item.

       <u>Lsof</u>  version  from  4.88  to  4.93.2  always  produced  one more field, the file descriptor (`f') field.
       However, <u>lsof</u> in this version doesn't produce it. This change is for supporting the use case that a  user
       needs  only the PID field, and doesn't need the file descriptor field. Specify `f' explicitly if you need
       the field.

       It is entirely possible to select a set of fields that cannot easily be  parsed  -  e.g.,  if  the  field
       descriptor  field  is  not  selected,  it may be difficult to identify file sets.  To help you avoid this
       difficulty, <u>lsof</u> supports the <b>-F</b> option; it selects the output of all fields with NL terminators (the <b>-F0</b>
       option pair selects the output of all fields with NUL terminators).  For compatibility reasons neither <b>-F</b>
       nor <b>-F0</b> select the raw device field.

       These are the fields that <u>lsof</u> will produce.  The single character listed first is the field identifier.

                 of <b>-F?</b> identifies the information to be found
                 in dialect-specific fields.)

       You can get on-line help information on these characters and their descriptions  by  specifying  the  <b>-F?</b>
       option pair.  (Escape the `?' character as your shell requires.)  Additional information on field content
       can be found in the <b>OUTPUT</b> section.

       As  an  example,  ``<b>-F</b> <b>pcfn</b>'' will select the process ID (`p'), command name (`c'), file descriptor (`f')
       and file name (`n') fields with an NL field terminator character; ``<b>-F</b> <b>pcfn0</b>'' selects  the  same  output
       with a NUL (000) field terminator character.

       <u>Lsof</u>  doesn't  produce  all  fields  for  every process or file set, only those that are available.  Some
       fields are mutually exclusive: file device characters and file major/minor  device  numbers;  file  inode
       number  and  protocol  name; file name and stream identification; file size and offset.  One or the other
       member of these mutually exclusive sets will appear in field output, but not both.

       Normally <u>lsof</u> ends each field with a NL (012) character.  The 0 (zero) field identifier character may  be
       specified  to  change  the  field terminator character to a NUL (000).  A NUL terminator may be easier to
       process with <u>xargs</u> <u>(1),</u> for example, or with programs whose quoting mechanisms may not easily  cope  with
       the  range  of  characters  in the field output.  When the NUL field terminator is in use, <u>lsof</u> ends each
       process and file set with a NL (012).

       Three aids to  producing  programs  that  can  process  <u>lsof</u>  field  output  are  included  in  the  <u>lsof</u>
       distribution.   The  first  is  a  C  header  file,  <u>lsof_fields.h</u>,  that  contains symbols for the field
       identification characters, indexes for storing them in a table,  and  explanation  strings  that  may  be
       compiled into programs.  <u>Lsof</u> uses this header file.

       The  second aid is a set of sample scripts that process field output, written in <u>awk</u>, <u>Perl</u> 4, and <u>Perl</u> 5.
       They're located in the <u>scripts</u> subdirectory of the <u>lsof</u> distribution.

       The third aid is the C library used for the <u>lsof</u> test suite.  The test suite is written  in  C  and  uses
       field  output  to  validate the correct operation of <u>lsof</u>.  The library can be found in the <u>tests/LTlib.c</u>
       file of the <u>lsof</u> distribution.  The library uses the first aid, the <u>lsof_fields.h</u> header file.

</pre><h4><b>BLOCKS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TIMEOUTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Lsof</u> can be blocked by some kernel functions that it uses - <u><a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a></u>(2), <u><a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink</a></u>(2),  and  <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2).   These
       functions  are  stalled  in the kernel, for example, when the hosts where mounted NFS file systems reside
       become inaccessible.

       <u>Lsof</u> attempts to break these blocks with timers and child processes, but the techniques  are  not  wholly
       reliable.   When  <u>lsof</u> does manage to break a block, it will report the break with an error message.  The
       messages may be suppressed with the <b>-t</b> and <b>-w</b> options.

       The default timeout value may be displayed with the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b>  option, and it may be changed with  the  <b>-S</b>
       <u>[t]</u>  option.   The  minimum  for  <u>t</u>  is two seconds, but you should avoid small values, since slow system
       responsiveness can cause short timeouts to expire unexpectedly  and  perhaps  stop  <u>lsof</u>  before  it  can
       produce any output.

       When  <u>lsof</u>  has  to  break  a  block  during  its  access of mounted file system information, it normally
       continues, although with less information available to display about open files.

       <u>Lsof</u> can also be directed to avoid the protection of timers and child processes  when  using  the  kernel
       functions that might block by specifying the <b>-O</b> option.  While this will allow <u>lsof</u> to start up with less
       overhead,  it  exposes  <u>lsof</u>  completely  to  the kernel situations that might block it.  Use this option
       cautiously.

</pre><h4><b>AVOIDING</b> <b>KERNEL</b> <b>BLOCKS</b></h4><pre>
       You can use the <b>-b</b> option to tell <u>lsof</u> to avoid using kernel functions that would block.   Some  cautions
       apply.

       First,  using  this  option usually requires that your system supply alternate device numbers in place of
       the device numbers that <u>lsof</u> would normally obtain with the <u><a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a></u>(2) and <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) kernel  functions.   See
       the <b>ALTERNATE</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>NUMBERS</b> section for more information on alternate device numbers.

       Second,  you  can't  specify  <u>names</u> for <u>lsof</u> to locate unless they're file system names.  This is because
       <u>lsof</u> needs to know the device and inode numbers of files listed with <u>names</u> in the <u>lsof</u> options,  and  the
       <b>-b</b>  option  prevents <u>lsof</u> from obtaining them.  Moreover, since <u>lsof</u> only has device numbers for the file
       systems that have alternates, its ability to locate files on  file  systems  depends  completely  on  the
       availability  and  accuracy  of the alternates.  If no alternates are available, or if they're incorrect,
       <u>lsof</u> won't be able to locate files on the named file systems.

       Third, if the names of your file system directories that <u>lsof</u> obtains from your system's mount table  are
       symbolic  links,  <u>lsof</u>  won't be able to resolve the links.  This is because the <b>-b</b> option causes <u>lsof</u> to
       avoid the kernel <u><a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink</a></u>(2) function it uses to resolve symbolic links.

       Finally, using the <b>-b</b> option causes <u>lsof</u> to issue warning messages  when  it  needs  to  use  the  kernel
       functions  that  the <b>-b</b> option directs it to avoid.  You can suppress these messages by specifying the <b>-w</b>
       option, but if you do, you won't see the alternate device numbers reported in the warning messages.

</pre><h4><b>ALTERNATE</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>NUMBERS</b></h4><pre>
       On some dialects, when <u>lsof</u> has to break a block because it can't get information about  a  mounted  file
       system  via  the  <u><a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a></u>(2) and <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) kernel functions, or because you specified the <b>-b</b> option, <u>lsof</u> can
       obtain some of the information it needs - the device number and possibly the file system type - from  the
       system  mount  table.   When  that is possible, <u>lsof</u> will report the device number it obtained.  (You can
       suppress the report by specifying the <b>-w</b> option.)

       You can assist this process if your mount table is supported with an <u><a href="file:/etc/mtab">/etc/mtab</a></u> or <u>/etc/mnttab</u>  file  that
       contains  an  options field by adding a ``dev=xxxx'' field for mount points that do not have one in their
       options strings.  Note: you must be able to edit the file - i.e., some mount tables like  recent  Solaris
       /etc/mnttab or Linux <a href="file:/proc/mounts">/proc/mounts</a> are read-only and can't be modified.

       You  may also be able to supply device numbers using the <b>+m</b> and <b>+m</b> <u>m</u> options, provided they are supported
       by your dialect.  Check the output of <u>lsof's</u> <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b>  options to see if the <b>+m</b>  and  <b>+m</b>  <u>m</u>  options  are
       available.

       The  ``xxxx'' portion of the field is the hexadecimal value of the file system's device number.  (Consult
       the <u>st_dev</u> field of the output of the <u><a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a></u>(2) and <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) functions for the appropriate values for  your
       file  systems.)   Here's an example from a Sun Solaris 2.6 <u>/etc/mnttab</u> for a file system remotely mounted
       via NFS:

            nfs  ignore,noquota,dev=2a40001

       There's an advantage to having ``dev=xxxx'' entries in your mount table file, especially for file systems
       that are mounted from remote NFS servers.  When a remote server crashes and  you  want  to  identify  its
       users  by running <u>lsof</u> on one of its clients, <u>lsof</u> probably won't be able to get output from the <u><a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a></u>(2)
       and <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) functions for the file system.  If it can obtain the file system's  device  number  from  the
       mount table, it will be able to display the files open on the crashed NFS server.

       Some  dialects  that  do  not  use  an  ASCII <u><a href="file:/etc/mtab">/etc/mtab</a></u> or <u>/etc/mnttab</u> file for the mount table may still
       provide an alternative device number in their internal mount tables.  This includes  AIX,  Apple  Darwin,
       FreeBSD,  NetBSD,  OpenBSD,  and  Tru64 UNIX.  <u>Lsof</u> knows how to obtain the alternative device number for
       these dialects and uses it when its attempt to <u><a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a></u>(2) or <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) the file system is blocked.

       If you're not sure your dialect supplies alternate device numbers for file systems from its mount  table,
       use this <u>lsof</u> incantation to see if it reports any alternate device numbers:

              lsof -b

       Look for standard error file warning messages that begin ``assuming "dev=xxxx" from ...''.

</pre><h4><b>KERNEL</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>CACHE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Lsof</u>  is  able  to  examine  the  kernel's name cache or use other kernel facilities (e.g., the ADVFS 4.x
       tag_to_path() function under Tru64 UNIX) on some dialects for most file system types, excluding AFS,  and
       extract recently used path name components from it.  (AFS file system path lookups don't use the kernel's
       name cache; some Solaris VxFS file system operations apparently don't use it, either.)

       <u>Lsof</u>  reports  the  complete paths it finds in the NAME column.  If <u>lsof</u> can't report all components in a
       path, it reports in the NAME column the file system name,  followed  by  a  space,  two  `-'  characters,
       another space, and the name components it has located, separated by the `/' character.

       When  <u>lsof</u> is run in repeat mode - i.e., with the <b>-r</b> option specified - the extent to which it can report
       path name components for the same file may vary from  cycle  to  cycle.   That's  because  other  running
       processes can cause the kernel to remove entries from its name cache and replace them with others.

       <u>Lsof's</u>  use  of  the  kernel  name  cache  to identify the paths of files can lead it to report incorrect
       components under some circumstances.  This can happen when the kernel name cache  uses  device  and  node
       number  as  a  key  (e.g., SCO OpenServer) and a key on a rapidly changing file system is reused.  If the
       UNIX dialect's kernel doesn't purge the name cache entry for a file when it is unlinked, <u>lsof</u> may find  a
       reference  to the wrong entry in the cache.  The <u>lsof</u> FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.)  has more
       information on this situation.

       <u>Lsof</u> can report path name components for these dialects:

            FreeBSD
            HP-UX
            Linux
            NetBSD
            SCO OpenServer
            SCO|Caldera UnixWare
            Solaris
            Tru64 UNIX

       <u>Lsof</u> can't report path name components for these dialects:

            AIX
            OpenBSD

       If you want to know why <u>lsof</u> can't report path name components for some dialects, see the <u>lsof</u>  FAQ  (The
       <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.)

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Examining  all  members of the <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> (or <u>/devices</u>) node tree with <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) functions can be time consuming.
       What's more, the information that <u>lsof</u> needs - device number, inode number, and path - rarely changes.

       Consequently, <u>lsof</u> normally maintains an ASCII  text  file  of  cached  <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u>  (or  <u>/devices</u>)  information
       (exception: the /proc-based Linux <u>lsof</u> where it's not needed.)  The local system administrator who builds
       <u>lsof</u> can control the way the device cache file path is formed, selecting from these options:

            Path from the <b>-D</b> option;
            Path from an environment variable;
            System-wide path;
            Personal path (the default);
            Personal path, modified by an environment variable.

       Consult  the  output  of the <b>-h</b>, <b>-D?</b> <b>,</b> or <b>-?</b>  help options for the current state of device cache support.
       The help output lists the default read-mode device cache file path that is  in  effect  for  the  current
       invocation  of  <u>lsof</u>.   The <b>-D?</b>  option output lists the read-only and write device cache file paths, the
       names of any applicable environment variables, and the personal device cache path format.

       <u>Lsof</u> can detect that the current device cache file has  been  accidentally  or  maliciously  modified  by
       integrity  checks,  including  the  computation and verification of a sixteen bit Cyclic Redundancy Check
       (CRC) sum on the file's contents.  When <u>lsof</u> senses something wrong with the file, it  issues  a  warning
       and  attempts to remove the current cache file and create a new copy, but only to a path that the process
       can legitimately write.

       The path from which a <u>lsof</u> process may attempt to read a device cache file may not be  the  same  as  the
       path  to which it can legitimately write.  Thus when <u>lsof</u> senses that it needs to update the device cache
       file, it may choose a different path for writing it from the path from which  it  read  an  incorrect  or
       outdated version.

       If available, the <b>-Dr</b> option will inhibit the writing of a new device cache file.  (It's always available
       when specified without a path name argument.)

       When  a  new  device  is added to the system, the device cache file may need to be recreated.  Since <u>lsof</u>
       compares the mtime of the device cache file with the mtime and ctime of the <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> (or <u>/devices</u>) directory,
       it usually detects that a new device has been added; in that case  <u>lsof</u>  issues  a  warning  message  and
       attempts to rebuild the device cache file.

       Whenever <u>lsof</u> writes a device cache file, it sets its ownership to the real UID of the executing process,
       and its permission modes to 0600, this restricting its reading and writing to the file's owner.

</pre><h4><b>LSOF</b> <b>PERMISSIONS</b> <b>THAT</b> <b>AFFECT</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       Two  permissions of the <u>lsof</u> executable affect its ability to access device cache files.  The permissions
       are set by the local system administrator when <u>lsof</u> is installed.

       The first and rarer permission is setuid-root.  It comes into effect when <u>lsof</u> is executed; its effective
       UID is then root, while its real (i.e., that of the logged-on user) UID is not.   The  <u>lsof</u>  distribution
       recommends that versions for these dialects run setuid-root.

            HP-UX 11.11 and 11.23
            Linux

       The  second  and  more  common  permission  is  setgid.   It  comes  into effect when the effective group
       IDentification number (GID) of the <u>lsof</u> process is set to one that can access  kernel  memory  devices  -
       e.g., ``kmem'', ``sys'', or ``system''.

       An  <u>lsof</u>  process  that has setgid permission usually surrenders the permission after it has accessed the
       kernel memory devices.  When it does that, <u>lsof</u> can allow more liberal device cache path formations.  The
       <u>lsof</u> distribution recommends that versions for these dialects run setgid  and  be  allowed  to  surrender
       setgid permission.

       (Note: <u>lsof</u> for AIX 5L and above needs setuid-root permission if its <b>-X</b> option is used.)

       <u>Lsof</u> for these dialects does not support a device cache, so the permissions given to the executable don't
       apply to the device cache file.

            Linux

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>PATH</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>THE</b> <b>-D</b> <b>OPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>-D</b>  option  provides  limited means for specifying the device cache file path.  Its <b>?</b>  function will
       report the read-only and write device cache file paths that <u>lsof</u> will use.

       When the <b>-D</b> <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>u</b> functions are available, you can use them to request that the cache file be built
       in a specific location (<b>b</b>[<u>path</u>]); read but not rebuilt (<b>r</b>[<u>path</u>]); or read and rebuilt (<b>u</b>[<u>path</u>]).  The  <b>b</b>,
       <b>r</b>,  and  <b>u</b>  functions are restricted under some conditions.  They are restricted when the <u>lsof</u> process is
       setuid-root.  The path specified with the <b>r</b> function is always read-only, even when it is available.

       The <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>u</b> functions are also restricted  when  the  <u>lsof</u>  process  runs  setgid  and  <u>lsof</u>  doesn't
       surrender  the setgid permission.  (See the <b>LSOF</b> <b>PERMISSIONS</b> <b>THAT</b> <b>AFFECT</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>ACCESS</b> section
       for a list of implementations that normally don't surrender their setgid permission.)

       A further <b>-D</b> function, <b>i</b> (for ignore), is always available.

       When available, the <b>b</b> function tells <u>lsof</u> to read device information from the  kernel  with  the  <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2)
       function and build a device cache file at the indicated path.

       When  available, the <b>r</b> function tells <u>lsof</u> to read the device cache file, but not update it.  When a path
       argument accompanies <b>-Dr</b>, it names the device cache file path.  The <b>r</b> function is always  available  when
       it  is  specified  without  a  path name argument.  If <u>lsof</u> is not running setuid-root and surrenders its
       setgid permission, a path name argument may accompany the <b>r</b> function.

       When available, the <b>u</b> function tells <u>lsof</u> to attempt to read and use the device cache file.  If it  can't
       read  the  file,  or if it finds the contents of the file incorrect or outdated, it will read information
       from the kernel, and attempt to write an updated version of the device cache file, but only to a path  it
       considers legitimate for the <u>lsof</u> process effective and real UIDs.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>PATH</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>AN</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Lsof's</u>  second choice for the device cache file is the contents of the LSOFDEVCACHE environment variable.
       It avoids this choice if the <u>lsof</u> process is setuid-root, or the real UID of the process is root.

       A further restriction applies to a device  cache  file  path  taken  from  the  LSOFDEVCACHE  environment
       variable:  <u>lsof</u>  will not write a device cache file to the path if the <u>lsof</u> process doesn't surrender its
       setgid permission.  (See  the  <b>LSOF</b>  <b>PERMISSIONS</b>  <b>THAT</b>  <b>AFFECT</b>  <b>DEVICE</b>  <b>CACHE</b>  <b>FILE</b>  <b>ACCESS</b>  section  for
       information on implementations that don't surrender their setgid permission.)

       The local system administrator can disable the use of the LSOFDEVCACHE environment variable or change its
       name when building <u>lsof</u>.  Consult the output of <b>-D?</b>  for the environment variable's name.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM-WIDE</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>PATH</b></h4><pre>
       The  local  system  administrator  may choose to have a system-wide device cache file when building <u>lsof</u>.
       That file will generally be constructed by a special system administration procedure when the  system  is
       booted  or  when  the contents of <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> or <u>/devices</u>) changes.  If defined, it is <u>lsof's</u> third device cache
       file path choice.

       You can tell that a system-wide device cache file is in effect for your local installation  by  examining
       the <u>lsof</u> help option output - i.e., the output from the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b>  option.

       <u>Lsof</u>  will never write to the system-wide device cache file path by default.  It must be explicitly named
       with a <b>-D</b> function in a root-owned procedure.  Once the file has been written, the procedure must  change
       its permission modes to 0644 (owner-read and owner-write, group-read, and other-read).

</pre><h4><b>PERSONAL</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>PATH</b> <b>(DEFAULT)</b></h4><pre>
       The  default device cache file path of the <u>lsof</u> distribution is one recorded in the home directory of the
       real UID that executes <u>lsof</u>.  Added to the home  directory  is  a  second  path  component  of  the  form
       <u>.lsof_hostname</u>.

       This is <u>lsof's</u> fourth device cache file path choice, and is usually the default.  If a system-wide device
       cache  file path was defined when <u>lsof</u> was built, this fourth choice will be applied when <u>lsof</u> can't find
       the system-wide device cache file.  This is the <b>only</b> time <u>lsof</u> uses two paths  when  reading  the  device
       cache file.

       The  <u>hostname</u>  part  of  the  second  component  is  the  base name of the executing host, as returned by
       <u><a href="../man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname</a></u>(2).  The base name is  defined  to  be  the  characters  preceding  the  first  `.'   in  the
       <u><a href="../man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname</a></u>(2) output, or all the <u><a href="../man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname</a></u>(2) output if it contains no `.'.

       The  device  cache  file belongs to the user ID and is readable and writable by the user ID alone - i.e.,
       its modes are 0600.  Each distinct real user ID on a given host that executes <u>lsof</u> has a distinct  device
       cache  file.   The  <u>hostname</u>  part  of  the  path distinguishes device cache files in an NFS-mounted home
       directory into which device cache files are written from several different hosts.

       The personal device cache file path formed by this method represents a device cache file that  <u>lsof</u>  will
       attempt  to  read,  and  will attempt to write should it not exist or should its contents be incorrect or
       outdated.

       The <b>-Dr</b> option without a path name argument will inhibit the writing of a new device cache file.

       The <b>-D?</b>  option will list the format specification for constructing the personal device cache file.   The
       conversions used in the format specification are described in the <u>00DCACHE</u> file of the <u>lsof</u> distribution.

</pre><h4><b>MODIFIED</b> <b>PERSONAL</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>PATH</b></h4><pre>
       If  this  option  is  defined  by  the  local system administrator when <u>lsof</u> is built, the LSOFPERSDCPATH
       environment variable contents may be used to add a component of the personal device cache file path.

       The LSOFPERSDCPATH variable contents are inserted in the path at the place marked  by  the  local  system
       administrator with the ``%p'' conversion in the HASPERSDC format specification of the dialect's <u>machine.h</u>
       header file.  (It's placed right after the home directory in the default <u>lsof</u> distribution.)

       Thus,  for  example,  if LSOFPERSDCPATH contains ``LSOF'', the home directory is ``/Homes/abe'', the host
       name is ``lsof.itap.purdue.edu'', and the  HASPERSDC  format  is  the  default  (``%h/%p.lsof_%L''),  the
       modified personal device cache file path is:

            /Homes/abe/LSOF/.lsof_vic

       The  LSOFPERSDCPATH environment variable is ignored when the <u>lsof</u> process is setuid-root or when the real
       UID of the process is root.

       <u>Lsof</u> will not write to a modified personal device cache file path if the <u>lsof</u> process  doesn't  surrender
       setgid  permission.  (See the <b>LSOF</b> <b>PERMISSIONS</b> <b>THAT</b> <b>AFFECT</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>ACCESS</b> section for a list of
       implementations that normally don't surrender their setgid permission.)

       If, for example, you want to create a sub-directory of personal device cache  file  paths  by  using  the
       LSOFPERSDCPATH  environment  variable  to  name it, and <u>lsof</u> doesn't surrender its setgid permission, you
       will have to allow <u>lsof</u> to create device cache files at the standard personal path and move them to  your
       subdirectory with shell commands.

       The  local  system  administrator  may:  disable  this  option when <u>lsof</u> is built; change the name of the
       environment variable from LSOFPERSDCPATH to something else; change the HASPERSDC format  to  include  the
       personal  path  component in another place; or exclude the personal path component entirely.  Consult the
       output of the <b>-D?</b>  option for the environment variable's name and the HASPERSDC format specification.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Errors are identified with messages on the standard error file.

       <u>Lsof</u> returns a one (1) if any error was detected, including the failure to  locate  command  names,  file
       names,  Internet  addresses  or files, login names, NFS files, PIDs, PGIDs, or UIDs it was asked to list.
       If the <b>-V</b> option is specified, <u>lsof</u> will indicate the search items it failed to list.  If the  <b>-Q</b>  option
       is specified, <u>lsof</u> will ignore any search item failures and only return an error if something unusual and
       unrecoverable happened.

       It returns a zero (0) if no errors were detected and if either the <b>-Q</b> option was specified or it was able
       to list some information about all the specified search arguments.

       When  <u>lsof</u> cannot open access to <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> (or <u>/devices</u>) or one of its subdirectories, or get information on a
       file in them with <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2), it issues a warning message and  continues.   That  <u>lsof</u>  will  issue  warning
       messages  about inaccessible files in <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> (or <u>/devices</u>) is indicated in its help output - requested with
       the <b>-h</b> or &gt;B -?  options -  with the message:

            Inaccessible <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a> warnings are enabled.

       The warning message may be suppressed with the <b>-w</b> option.  It may also have been suppressed by the system
       administrator when <u>lsof</u> was compiled by the setting of the WARNDEVACCESS definition.  In this  case,  the
       output from the help options will include the message:

            Inaccessible <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a> warnings are disabled.

       Inaccessible  device  warning  messages  usually  disappear after <u>lsof</u> has created a working device cache
       file.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       For a more extensive set of examples, documented more fully,  see  the  <u>00QUICKSTART</u>  file  of  the  <u>lsof</u>
       distribution.

       To list all open files, use:

              lsof

       To list all open Internet, x.25 (HP-UX), and UNIX domain files, use:

              lsof -i -U

       To list all open IPv4 network files in use by the process whose PID is 1234, use:

              lsof -i 4 -a -p 1234

       If it's okay for PID 1234 to not exist, or for PID 1234 to not have any open IPv4 network files, add <b>-Q</b> :

              lsof -Q -i 4 -a -p 1234

       Presuming the UNIX dialect supports IPv6, to list only open IPv6 network files, use:

              lsof -i 6

       To list all files using any protocol on ports 513, 514, or 515 of host wonderland.cc.purdue.edu, use:

              lsof -i @wonderland.cc.purdue.edu:513-515

       To  list  all  files  using  any protocol on any port of mace.cc.purdue.edu (cc.purdue.edu is the default
       domain), use:

              lsof -i @mace

       To list all open files for login name ``abe'', or user ID 1234,  or  process  456,  or  process  123,  or
       process 789, use:

              lsof -p 456,123,789 -u 1234,abe

       To list all open files on device /dev/hd4, use:

              lsof /dev/hd4

       To find the process that has /u/abe/foo open without worrying if there are none, use:

              lsof -Q /u/abe/foo

       To take action only if a process has /u/abe/foo open, use:

              lsof /u/abe/foo  echo "still in use"

       To send a SIGHUP to the processes that have /u/abe/bar open, use:

              kill -HUP `lsof -t /u/abe/bar`

       To find any open file, including an open UNIX domain socket file, with the name <u>/dev/log</u>, use:

              lsof /dev/log

       To  find  processes  with  open  files  on  the  NFS  file  system named <u>/nfs/mount/point</u> whose server is
       inaccessible, and presuming your mount table supplies the device number for <u>/nfs/mount/point</u>, use:

              lsof -b /nfs/mount/point

       To do the preceding search with warning messages suppressed, use:

              lsof -bw /nfs/mount/point

       To ignore the device cache file, use:

              lsof -Di

       To obtain PID and command name field output for each process, file descriptor, file  device  number,  and
       file inode number for each file of each process, use:

              lsof -FpcfDi

       To  list  the files at descriptors 1 and 3 of every process running the <u>lsof</u> command for login ID ``abe''
       every 10 seconds, use:

              lsof -c lsof -a -d 1 -d 3 -u abe -r10

       To list the current working directory of processes running a command that is exactly four characters long
       and has an 'o' or 'O' in character three, use this regular expression form of the <b>-c</b> <u>c</u> option:

              lsof -c /^..o.$/i -a -d cwd

       To find an IP version 4 socket file by its associated numeric dot-form address, use:

              lsof -<a href="mailto:i@128.210.15.17">i@128.210.15.17</a>

       To find an IP version 6 socket file (when the UNIX dialect  supports  IPv6)  by  its  associated  numeric
       colon-form address, use:

              lsof -i@[0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7]

       To  find  an  IP  version  6  socket  file (when the UNIX dialect supports IPv6) by an associated numeric
       colon-form address that has a run of zeroes in it - e.g., the loop-back address - use:

              lsof -i@[::1]

       To obtain a repeat mode marker line that contains the current time, use:

              lsof -rm====%T====

       To add spaces to the previous marker line, use:

              lsof -r "m==== %T ===="

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Since <u>lsof</u> reads kernel memory in its search for open files, rapid changes in kernel memory  may  produce
       unpredictable results.

       When  a  file  has  multiple  record  locks, the lock status character (following the file descriptor) is
       derived from a test of the first lock structure, not from any combination of the individual record  locks
       that might be described by multiple lock structures.

       <u>Lsof</u>  can't search for files with restrictive access permissions by <u>name</u> unless it is installed with root
       set-UID permission.  Otherwise it is limited to searching for files to which  its  user  or  its  set-GID
       group (if any) has access permission.

       The  display  of  the  destination address of a raw socket (e.g., for <u>ping</u>) depends on the UNIX operating
       system.  Some dialects store the destination address in the raw socket's protocol control block, some  do
       not.

       <u>Lsof</u>  can't  always  represent  Solaris device numbers in the same way that <u><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></u>(1) does.  For example, the
       major and minor device numbers that the <u><a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a></u>(2) and <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) functions report for the directory on  which
       CD-ROM  files  are mounted (typically <u>/cdrom</u>) are not the same as the ones that it reports for the device
       on which CD-ROM files are mounted (typically <u>/dev/sr0</u>).  (<u>Lsof</u> reports the directory numbers.)

       The support for <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u> file systems is available only for BSD and Tru64 UNIX dialects, Linux, and dialects
       derived from SYSV R4 - e.g., FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, UnixWare.

       Some <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u> file items - device number, inode number, and file size - are unavailable  in  some  dialects.
       Searching for files in a <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u> file system may require that the full path name be specified.

       No  text  (<b>txt</b>) file descriptors are displayed for Linux processes.  All entries for files other than the
       current  working  directory,  the  root  directory,  and  numerical  file  descriptors  are  labeled  <b>mem</b>
       descriptors.

       <u>Lsof</u>  can't  search  for  Tru64 UNIX named pipes by name, because their kernel implementation of <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a>(2)
       returns an improper device number for a named pipe.

       <u>Lsof</u> can't report fully or correctly on HP-UX 9.01, 10.20, and 11.00 locks because of insufficient access
       to kernel data or errors in the kernel data.  See the <u>lsof</u> FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.)  for
       details.

       The AIX SMT file type is a fabrication.  It's made up for file structures whose type (15)  isn't  defined
       in  the  AIX  <u>/usr/include/sys/file.h</u>  header  file.   One way to create such file structures is to run X
       clients with the DISPLAY variable set to ``:0.0''.

       The <b>+|-f</b><u>[cfn]</u> option is not supported under /proc-based  Linux  <u>lsof</u>,  because  it  doesn't  read  kernel
       structures from kernel memory.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Lsof</u> may access these environment variables.

       LANG              defines  a language locale.  See <u><a href="../man3/setlocale.3.html">setlocale</a></u>(3) for the names of other variables that can
                         be used in place of LANG - e.g., LC_ALL, LC_TYPE, etc.

       LSOFDEVCACHE      defines the path to a device cache file.  See the <b>DEVICE</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>PATH</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>AN</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
                         <b>VARIABLE</b> section for more information.

       LSOFPERSDCPATH    defines the middle component of a modified personal device cache file  path.   See  the
                         <b>MODIFIED</b> <b>PERSONAL</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>PATH</b> section for more information.
