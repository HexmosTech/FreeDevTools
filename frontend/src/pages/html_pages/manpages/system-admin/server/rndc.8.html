</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rndc - name server control utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rndc</b>  [<b>-b</b>  source-address]  [<b>-c</b>  config-file]  [<b>-k</b>  key-file]  [<b>-s</b>  server]  [<b>-p</b> port] [<b>-q</b>] [<b>-r</b>] [<b>-V</b>] [<b>-y</b>
       server_key] [[<b>-4</b>] | [<b>-6</b>]] {command}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rndc</b> controls the operation of a name server. If  <b>rndc</b>  is  invoked  with  no  command  line  options  or
       arguments,  it  prints  a  short  summary  of  the supported commands and the available options and their
       arguments.

       <b>rndc</b> communicates with the name server over a TCP connection, sending commands authenticated with digital
       signatures. In the current versions of <b>rndc</b> and <u>named</u>, the only supported authentication  algorithms  are
       HMAC-MD5   (for   compatibility),   HMAC-SHA1,   HMAC-SHA224,  HMAC-SHA256  (default),  HMAC-SHA384,  and
       HMAC-SHA512. They use a  shared  secret  on  each  end  of  the  connection,  which  provides  TSIG-style
       authentication  for  the  command  request  and  the  name server's response.  All commands sent over the
       channel must be signed by a server_key known to the server.

       <b>rndc</b> reads a configuration file to determine how to contact the name server and decide what algorithm and
       key it should use.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-4</b>     This option indicates use of IPv4 only.

       <b>-6</b>     This option indicates use of IPv6 only.

       <b>-b</b> <b>source-address</b>
              This option indicates <b>source-address</b> as the source address  for  the  connection  to  the  server.
              Multiple instances are permitted, to allow setting of both the IPv4 and IPv6 source addresses.

       <b>-c</b> <b>config-file</b>
              This   option   indicates   <b>config-file</b>   as  the  configuration  file  instead  of  the  default,
              <b>/etc/bind/rndc.conf</b>.

       <b>-k</b> <b>key-file</b>
              This option indicates <b>key-file</b> as the key file instead of the default, <b>/etc/bind/rndc.key</b>. The key
              in <b>/etc/bind/rndc.key</b> is used to authenticate commands sent to the server if the config-file  does
              not exist.

       <b>-s</b> <b>server</b>
              <b>server</b>  is the name or address of the server which matches a server statement in the configuration
              file for <b>rndc</b>. If no server is supplied on the command line, the host named by the  default-server
              clause in the options statement of the <b>rndc</b> configuration file is used.

       <b>-p</b> <b>port</b>
              This  option  instructs  BIND  9  to send commands to TCP port <b>port</b> instead of its default control
              channel port, 953.

       <b>-q</b>     This option sets quiet mode, where message text returned by the server is not printed unless there
              is an error.

       <b>-r</b>     This option instructs <b>rndc</b> to print  the  result  code  returned  by  <u>named</u>  after  executing  the
              requested command (e.g., ISC_R_SUCCESS, ISC_R_FAILURE, etc.).

       <b>-t</b> <b>timeout</b>
              This  option  sets the idle timeout period for <b>rndc</b> to <b>timeout</b> seconds. The default is 60 seconds,
              and the maximum settable value is 86400 seconds (1 day). If set to 0, there is no timeout.

       <b>-V</b>     This option enables verbose logging.

       <b>-y</b> <b>server_key</b>
              This option indicates use of the key <b>server_key</b> from the configuration file. For  control  message
              validation  to  succeed,  <b>server_key</b>  must  be  known  by <u>named</u> with the same algorithm and secret
              string. If no <b>server_key</b> is specified, <b>rndc</b> first looks for a key clause in the  server  statement
              of  the  server  being  used,  or  if  no  server  statement is present for that host, then in the
              default-key clause of the options statement. Note that  the  configuration  file  contains  shared
              secrets  which  are  used  to  send  authenticated  control  commands  to name servers, and should
              therefore not have general read or write access.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       A list of commands supported by <b>rndc</b> can be seen by running <b>rndc</b> without arguments.

       Currently supported commands are:

       <b>addzone</b> <b>zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]</b> <b>configuration</b>
              This command adds a zone while the server is running. This command  requires  the  <b>allow-new-zones</b>
              option  to  be  set  to  <b>yes</b>.  The  configuration string specified on the command line is the zone
              configuration text that would ordinarily be placed in <u>named.conf</u>.

              The configuration is saved in a file called <b>viewname.nzf</b> (or, if <u>named</u> is compiled  with  liblmdb,
              an LMDB database file called <b>viewname.nzd</b>). <b>viewname</b> is the name of the view, unless the view name
              contains  characters  that are incompatible with use as a file name, in which case a cryptographic
              hash of the view name is used instead. When <u>named</u> is restarted, the file is loaded into  the  view
              configuration so that zones that were added can persist after a restart.

              This sample <b>addzone</b> command adds the zone <b>example.com</b> to the default view:

              <b>rndc</b> <b>addzone</b> <b>example.com</b> <b>'{</b> <b>type</b> <b>primary;</b> <b>file</b> <b>"example.com.db";</b> <b>};'</b>

              (Note the brackets around and semi-colon after the zone configuration text.)

              See also <u>rndc</u> <u>delzone</u> and <u>rndc</u> <u>modzone</u>.

       <b>delzone</b> <b>[-clean]</b> <b>zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]</b>
              This command deletes a zone while the server is running.

              If the <b>-clean</b> argument is specified, the zone's master file (and journal file, if any) are deleted
              along  with the zone. Without the <b>-clean</b> option, zone files must be deleted manually. (If the zone
              is of type <b>secondary</b> or <b>stub</b>, the files needing to be removed are reported in the  output  of  the
              <b>rndc</b> <b>delzone</b> command.)

              If  the zone was originally added via <b>rndc</b> <b>addzone</b>, then it is removed permanently. However, if it
              was originally configured in <u>named.conf</u>, then that original configuration remains in  place;  when
              the  server is restarted or reconfigured, the zone is recreated. To remove it permanently, it must
              also be removed from <u>named.conf</u>.

              See also <u>rndc</u> <u>addzone</u> and <u>rndc</u> <u>modzone</u>.

       <b>dnssec</b> <b>(-status</b> <b>|</b> <b>-rollover</b> <b>-key</b> <b>id</b> <b>[-alg</b> <b>algorithm]</b> <b>[-when</b> <b>time]</b> <b>|</b> <b>-checkds</b> <b>[-key</b> <b>id</b> <b>[-alg</b> <b>algorithm]]</b>
       <b>[-when</b> <b>time]</b> <b>published</b> <b>|</b> <b>withdrawn))</b> <b>zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]</b>
              This command allows you to interact with the "dnssec-policy" of a given zone.

              <b>rndc</b> <b>dnssec</b> <b>-status</b> show the DNSSEC signing state for the specified zone.

              <b>rndc</b> <b>dnssec</b> <b>-rollover</b> allows you to schedule key rollover  for  a  specific  key  (overriding  the
              original key lifetime).

              <b>rndc</b>  <b>dnssec</b>  <b>-checkds</b>  informs  <u>named</u> that the DS for a specified zone's key-signing key has been
              confirmed to be published in, or withdrawn from, the parent zone. This is  required  in  order  to
              complete  a  KSK  rollover.   The  <b>-key</b>  <b>id</b>  and <b>-alg</b> <b>algorithm</b> arguments can be used to specify a
              particular KSK, if necessary; if there is only one key  acting  as  a  KSK  for  the  zone,  these
              arguments  can be omitted.  The time of publication or withdrawal for the DS is set to the current
              time by default, but can be overridden to a specific time with the argument <b>-when</b> <b>time</b>, where <b>time</b>
              is expressed in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation.

       <b>dnstap</b> <b>(-reopen</b> <b>|</b> <b>-roll</b> <b>[number])</b>
              This command closes and re-opens DNSTAP output files.

              <b>rndc</b> <b>dnstap</b> <b>-reopen</b> allows the output file to be renamed externally, so that  <u>named</u>  can  truncate
              and re-open it.

              <b>rndc</b>  <b>dnstap</b>  <b>-roll</b>  causes  the output file to be rolled automatically, similar to log files. The
              most recent output file has ".0" appended to its name; the previous most  recent  output  file  is
              moved  to  ".1", and so on. If <b>number</b> is specified, then the number of backup log files is limited
              to that number.

       <b>dumpdb</b> <b>[-all</b> <b>|</b> <b>-cache</b> <b>|</b> <b>-zones</b> <b>|</b> <b>-adb</b> <b>|</b> <b>-bad</b> <b>|</b> <b>-expired</b> <b>|</b> <b>-fail]</b> <b>[view</b> <b>...]</b>
              This command dumps the server's caches (default) and/or zones to the dump file for  the  specified
              views.  If  no  view  is specified, all views are dumped.  (See the <b>dump-file</b> option in the BIND 9
              Administrator Reference Manual.)

       <b>fetchlimit</b> <b>[view]</b>
              This command dumps a list of servers  that  are  currently  being  rate-limited  as  a  result  of
              <b>fetches-per-server</b> settings, and a list of domain names that are currently being rate-limited as a
              result of <b>fetches-per-zone</b> settings.

       <b>flush</b>  This command flushes the server's cache.

       <b>flushname</b> <b>name</b> <b>[view]</b>
              This  command flushes the given name from the view's DNS cache and, if applicable, from the view's
              nameserver address database, bad server cache, and SERVFAIL cache.

       <b>flushtree</b> <b>name</b> <b>[view]</b>
              This command flushes the given name, and all of its subdomains, from the view's DNS cache, address
              database, bad server cache, and SERVFAIL cache.

       <b>freeze</b> <b>[zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]]</b>
              This command suspends updates to a dynamic zone. If no zone  is  specified,  then  all  zones  are
              suspended.  This  allows manual edits to be made to a zone normally updated by dynamic update, and
              causes changes in the journal file to be synced into the master file. All dynamic update  attempts
              are refused while the zone is frozen.

              See also <u>rndc</u> <u>thaw</u>.

       <b>halt</b> <b>[-p]</b>
              This  command stops the server immediately. Recent changes made through dynamic update or IXFR are
              not saved to the master files, but are rolled forward from the journal files when  the  server  is
              restarted.  If <b>-p</b> is specified, <u>named</u>'s process ID is returned. This allows an external process to
              determine when <u>named</u> has completed halting.

              See also <u>rndc</u> <u>stop</u>.

       <b>skr</b> <b>-import</b> <b>file</b> <b>zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]</b>
              This command allows you to import a SKR file for  the  specified  zone,  to  support  offline  KSK
              signing.

       <b>loadkeys</b> <b>[zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]]</b>
              This command fetches all DNSSEC keys for the given zone from the key directory. If they are within
              their publication period, they are merged into the zone's DNSKEY RRset. Unlike <u>rndc</u> <u>sign</u>, however,
              the  zone  is  not  immediately re-signed by the new keys, but is allowed to incrementally re-sign
              over time.

              This command requires that the zone be configured with a <b>dnssec-policy</b>, and also requires the zone
              to be configured to allow dynamic  DNS.  (See  "Dynamic  Update  Policies"  in  the  Administrator
              Reference Manual for more details.)

       <b>managed-keys</b> <b>(status</b> <b>|</b> <b>refresh</b> <b>|</b> <b>sync</b> <b>|</b> <b>destroy)</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]</b>
              This command inspects and controls the "managed-keys" database which handles <u>RFC</u> <u>5011</u> DNSSEC trust
              anchor  maintenance.  If  a view is specified, these commands are applied to that view; otherwise,
              they are applied to all views.

              • When run with the <b>status</b> keyword, this prints the current status of the managed-keys database.

              • When run with the <b>refresh</b> keyword, this forces an immediate refresh query to be sent for all the
                managed keys, updating the managed-keys database if any new keys are found, without waiting  the
                normal refresh interval.

              • When  run  with  the <b>sync</b> keyword, this forces an immediate dump of the managed-keys database to
                disk (in the file <b>managed-keys.bind</b> or (<b>viewname.mkeys</b>). This synchronizes the database with its
                journal file, so that the database's current contents can be inspected visually.

              • When run with the <b>destroy</b> keyword, the managed-keys database is shut down and deleted,  and  all
                key maintenance is terminated.  This command should be used only with extreme caution.

                Existing  keys  that  are  already  trusted  are  not deleted from memory; DNSSEC validation can
                continue after this command is used.  However, key maintenance operations cease until  <u>named</u>  is
                restarted or reconfigured, and all existing key maintenance states are deleted.

                Running  <u>rndc</u> <u>reconfig</u> or restarting <u>named</u> immediately after this command causes key maintenance
                to be reinitialized from scratch, just as if the server were being started for the  first  time.
                This  is  primarily intended for testing, but it may also be used, for example, to jumpstart the
                acquisition of new keys in the event of a trust anchor rollover, or as a brute-force repair  for
                key maintenance problems.

       <b>memprof</b> <b>[(on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>|</b> <b>dump)]</b>
              This command controls memory profiling. To have any effect, <u>named</u> must be built with jemalloc, the
              library have profiling support enabled and run with the <b>prof:true</b> allocator configuration. (either
              via <b>MALLOC_CONF</b> or <b>/etc/malloc.conf</b>)

              The <b>prof_active:false</b> option is recommended to ensure the profiling overhead does not affect <u>named</u>
              when not needed.

              The  <b>on</b>  and <b>off</b> options will start and stop the jemalloc memory profiling respectively.  When run
              with the <u>dump</u> option, <u>named</u> will dump the profile to the  working  directory.  The  name  will  be
              chosen automatically by jemalloc.

       <b>modzone</b> <b>zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]</b> <b>configuration</b>
              This  command  modifies  the  configuration  of  a  zone while the server is running. This command
              requires the <b>allow-new-zones</b> option to be set to <b>yes</b>.  As with <b>addzone</b>, the  configuration  string
              specified  on  the  command line is the zone configuration text that would ordinarily be placed in
              <u>named.conf</u>.

              If the zone was originally  added  via  <u>rndc</u>  <u>addzone</u>,  the  configuration  changes  are  recorded
              permanently  and are still in effect after the server is restarted or reconfigured. However, if it
              was originally configured in <u>named.conf</u>, then that original configuration remains in  place;  when
              the  server  is restarted or reconfigured, the zone reverts to its original configuration. To make
              the changes permanent, it must also be modified in <u>named.conf</u>.

              See also <u>rndc</u> <u>addzone</u> and <u>rndc</u> <u>delzone</u>.

       <b>notify</b> <b>zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]</b>
              This command resends NOTIFY messages for the zone.

       <b>notrace</b>
              This command sets the server's debugging level to 0.

              See also <u>rndc</u> <u>trace</u>.

       <b>nta</b> <b>[(-class</b> <b>class</b> <b>|</b> <b>-dump</b> <b>|</b> <b>-force</b> <b>|</b> <b>-remove</b> <b>|</b> <b>-lifetime</b> <b>duration)]</b> <b>domain</b> <b>[view]</b>
              This command sets a DNSSEC negative trust anchor (NTA) for <b>domain</b>, with a  lifetime  of  <b>duration</b>.
              The  default lifetime is configured in <u>named.conf</u> via the <b>nta-lifetime</b> option, and defaults to one
              hour. The lifetime cannot exceed one week.

              A negative trust anchor selectively disables DNSSEC validation for zones  that  are  known  to  be
              failing  because  of  misconfiguration  rather  than an attack. When data to be validated is at or
              below an active NTA (and above any other  configured  trust  anchors),  <u>named</u>  aborts  the  DNSSEC
              validation  process  and  treats  the data as insecure rather than bogus. This continues until the
              NTA's lifetime has elapsed.

              NTAs persist across restarts of the <u>named</u> server. The NTAs for a view are saved in a  file  called
              <b>name.nta</b>, where <b>name</b> is the name of the view; if it contains characters that are incompatible with
              use as a file name, a cryptographic hash is generated from the name of the view.

              An existing NTA can be removed by using the <b>-remove</b> option.

              An  NTA's  lifetime can be specified with the <b>-lifetime</b> option.  TTL-style suffixes can be used to
              specify the lifetime in seconds, minutes, or hours. If  the  specified  NTA  already  exists,  its
              lifetime is updated to the new value. Setting <b>lifetime</b> to zero is equivalent to <b>-remove</b>.

              If  <b>-dump</b>  is  used,  any other arguments are ignored and a list of existing NTAs is printed. Note
              that this may include NTAs that are expired but have not yet been cleaned up.

              Normally, <u>named</u> periodically tests to see whether data below an NTA can now be validated (see  the
              <b>nta-recheck</b>  option  in the Administrator Reference Manual for details). If data can be validated,
              then the NTA is regarded as no longer necessary  and  is  allowed  to  expire  early.  The  <b>-force</b>
              parameter overrides this behavior and forces an NTA to persist for its entire lifetime, regardless
              of whether data could be validated if the NTA were not present.

              The  view class can be specified with <b>-class</b>. The default is class <b>IN</b>, which is the only class for
              which DNSSEC is currently supported.

              All of these options can be shortened, i.e., to <b>-l</b>, <b>-r</b>, <b>-d</b>, <b>-f</b>, and <b>-c</b>.

              Unrecognized options are treated as errors. To refer to a domain or view name that begins  with  a
              hyphen, use a double-hyphen (--) on the command line to indicate the end of options.

       <b>querylog</b> <b>[(on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off)]</b>
              This  command enables or disables query logging. For backward compatibility, this command can also
              be used without an argument to toggle query logging on and off.

              Query logging can also be enabled by explicitly directing the <b>queries</b> <b>category</b> to a <b>channel</b> in the
              <b>logging</b> section of  <u>named.conf</u>,  or  by  specifying  <b>querylog</b>  <b>yes;</b>  in  the  <b>options</b>  section  of
              <u>named.conf</u>.

       <b>reconfig</b>
              This command reloads the configuration file and loads new zones, but does not reload existing zone
              files  even  if  they  have  changed. This is faster than a full <u>rndc</u> <u>reload</u> when there is a large
              number of zones, because it avoids the need to examine the modification times of the zone files.

       <b>recursing</b>
              This command dumps the list of queries <u>named</u> is currently recursing on, and the list of domains to
              which iterative queries are currently being sent.

              The first list includes all unique clients that are waiting for recursion to  complete,  including
              the  query  that  is  awaiting a response and the timestamp (seconds since the Unix epoch) of when
              named started processing this client query.

              The second list comprises of domains for which there are active (or recently  active)  fetches  in
              progress.   It reports the number of active fetches for each domain and the number of queries that
              have been passed (allowed) or dropped (spilled) as a result of the <b>fetches-per-zone</b> limit.  (Note:
              these counters are not cumulative over time; whenever the number of active fetches  for  a  domain
              drops  to  zero, the counter for that domain is deleted, and the next time a fetch is sent to that
              domain, it is recreated with the counters set to zero).

       <b>refresh</b> <b>zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]</b>
              This command schedules zone maintenance for the given zone.

       <b>reload</b> This command reloads the configuration file and zones.

              <b>zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]</b>

              If a zone is specified, this command reloads only the given zone.  If no zone  is  specified,  the
              reloading happens asynchronously.

       <b>reset-stats</b> <b>&lt;counter-name</b> <b>...&gt;</b>
              This command resets the requested statistics counters.

              At  least  one  counter  name  must  be  provided. Currently the following counters are supported:
              <b>recursive-high-water</b>, <b>tcp-high-water</b>.

       <b>responselog</b> <b>[on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off]</b>
              This command enables or disables response logging. For backward compatibility,  this  command  can
              also be used without an argument to toggle response logging on and off.

              Unlike  query  logging,  response  logging cannot be enabled by explicitly directing the <b>responses</b>
              <b>category</b> to a <b>channel</b> in the <b>logging</b> section of  <u>named.conf</u>,  but  it  can  still  be  enabled  by
              specifying <b>responselog</b> <b>yes;</b> in the <b>options</b> section of <u>named.conf</u>.

       <b>retransfer</b> <b>[-force]</b> <b>zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]</b>
              This command retransfers the given secondary zone from the primary server.

              If  the  zone  is  configured  to use <b>inline-signing</b>, the signed version of the zone is discarded;
              after the retransfer of the unsigned version is complete, the signed version is  regenerated  with
              new signatures. With the optional <b>-force</b> argument provided if there is an ongoing zone transfer it
              will be aborted before a new zone transfer is scheduled.

       <b>scan</b>   This command scans the list of available network interfaces for changes, without performing a full
              <u>rndc</u> <u>reconfig</u> or waiting for the <b>interface-interval</b> timer.

       <b>secroots</b> <b>[-]</b> <b>[view</b> <b>...]</b>
              This  command  dumps  the security roots (i.e., trust anchors configured via <b>trust-anchors</b>, or the
              <b>managed-keys</b> or <b>trusted-keys</b> statements [both deprecated], or <b>dnssec-validation</b> <b>auto</b>) and negative
              trust anchors for the specified views. If no view is specified, all  views  are  dumped.  Security
              roots  indicate whether they are configured as trusted keys, managed keys, or initializing managed
              keys (managed keys that have not yet been updated by a successful key refresh query).

              If the first argument is <b>-</b>, then the output is returned via the <b>rndc</b> response channel and  printed
              to  the  standard  output.   Otherwise, it is written to the secroots dump file, which defaults to
              <b>named.secroots</b>, but can be overridden via the <b>secroots-file</b> option in <u>named.conf</u>.

              See also <u>rndc</u> <u>managed-keys</u>.

       <b>serve-stale</b> <b>(on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>|</b> <b>reset</b> <b>|</b> <b>status)</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]</b>
              This command enables, disables, resets, or reports the current status  of  the  serving  of  stale
              answers as configured in <u>named.conf</u>.

              If  serving of stale answers is disabled by <b>rndc-serve-stale</b> <b>off</b>, then it remains disabled even if
              <u>named</u> is reloaded or reconfigured. <b>rndc</b> <b>serve-stale</b> <b>reset</b> restores the setting  as  configured  in
              <u>named.conf</u>.

              <b>rndc</b>  <b>serve-stale</b> <b>status</b> reports whether caching and serving of stale answers is currently enabled
              or disabled. It also reports the values of <b>stale-answer-ttl</b> and <b>max-stale-ttl</b>.

       <b>showzone</b> <b>zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]</b>
              This command prints the configuration of a running zone.

              See also <u>rndc</u> <u>zonestatus</u>.

       <b>sign</b> <b>zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]</b>
              This command fetches all DNSSEC  keys  for  the  given  zone  from  the  key  directory  (see  the
              <b>key-directory</b>  option  in  the  BIND  9  Administrator Reference Manual). If they are within their
              publication period, they are merged into the zone's DNSKEY RRset. If the DNSKEY RRset is  changed,
              then the zone is automatically re-signed with the new key set.

              This command requires that the zone be configured with a <b>dnssec-policy</b>, and also requires the zone
              to  be  configured  to  allow  dynamic  DNS.  (See  "Dynamic Update Policies" in the Administrator
              Reference Manual for more details.)

              See also <u>rndc</u> <u>loadkeys</u>.

       <b>signing</b> <b>[(-list</b> <b>|</b> <b>-clear</b> <b>keyid/algorithm</b> <b>|</b> <b>-clear</b> <b>all</b> <b>|</b> <b>-nsec3param</b> <b>(parameters</b> <b>|</b> <b>none)</b> <b>|</b> <b>-serial</b> <b>value)</b>
       <b>zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]</b>
              This command lists, edits, or removes the DNSSEC signing-state records for the specified zone. The
              status of ongoing DNSSEC operations, such as signing or generating NSEC3 chains, is stored in  the
              zone  in  the  form of DNS resource records of type <b>sig-signing-type</b>.  <b>rndc</b> <b>signing</b> <b>-list</b> converts
              these records into a human-readable form, indicating which keys  are  currently  signing  or  have
              finished signing the zone, and which NSEC3 chains are being created or removed.

              <b>rndc</b>  <b>signing</b> <b>-clear</b> can remove a single key (specified in the same format that <b>rndc</b> <b>signing</b> <b>-list</b>
              uses to display it), or all keys. In either case, only completed  keys  are  removed;  any  record
              indicating that a key has not yet finished signing the zone is retained.

              <b>rndc</b>  <b>signing</b>  <b>-nsec3param</b>  sets  the  NSEC3  parameters  for  a zone.  This is the only supported
              mechanism for using NSEC3 with <b>inline-signing</b> zones. Parameters are specified in the  same  format
              as an NSEC3PARAM resource record: <b>hash</b> <b>algorithm</b>, <b>flags</b>, <b>iterations</b>, and <b>salt</b>, in that order.

              Currently,  the  only  defined value for <b>hash</b> <b>algorithm</b> is <b>1</b>, representing SHA-1. The <b>flags</b> may be
              set to <b>0</b> or <b>1</b>, depending on whether the opt-out bit in the NSEC3 chain should be  set.  <b>iterations</b>
              defines  the  number of additional times to apply the algorithm when generating an NSEC3 hash. The
              <b>salt</b> is a string of data expressed in hexadecimal, a hyphen (<b>-</b>) if no salt is to be used,  or  the
              keyword <b>auto</b>, which causes <u>named</u> to generate a random 64-bit salt.

              The  only  recommended  configuration  is  <b>rndc</b> <b>signing</b> <b>-nsec3param</b> <b>1</b> <b>0</b> <b>0</b> <b>-</b> <b>zone</b>, i.e. no salt, no
              additional iterations, no opt-out.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 Do not use extra  iterations,  salt,  or  opt-out  unless  all  their  implications  are  fully
                 understood. A higher number of iterations causes interoperability problems and opens servers to
                 CPU-exhausting DoS attacks.

              <b>rndc</b> <b>signing</b> <b>-nsec3param</b> <b>none</b> removes an existing NSEC3 chain and replaces it with NSEC.

              <b>rndc</b>  <b>signing</b>  <b>-serial</b> <b>value</b> sets the serial number of the zone to <b>value</b>. If the value would cause
              the serial number to go backwards, it is rejected. The primary use of this parameter is to set the
              serial number on inline signed zones.

       <b>stats</b>  This command writes server statistics to the statistics file. (See the <b>statistics-file</b>  option  in
              the BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual.)

       <b>status</b> This  command  displays  the  status  of  the  server.  Note that the number of zones includes the
              internal <b>bind/CH</b> zone and the  default  <b>./IN</b>  hint  zone,  if  there  is  no  explicit  root  zone
              configured.

       <b>stop</b> <b>-p</b>
              This  command stops the server, making sure any recent changes made through dynamic update or IXFR
              are first saved to the master files of the updated zones. If <b>-p</b> is specified, <u>named</u>'s  process  ID
              is returned.  This allows an external process to determine when <u>named</u> has completed stopping.

              See also <u>rndc</u> <u>halt</u>.

       <b>sync</b> <b>-clean</b> <b>[zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]]</b>
              This  command  syncs  changes  in  the  journal file for a dynamic zone to the master file. If the
              "-clean" option is specified, the journal file is also removed. If no zone is specified, then  all
              zones are synced.

       <b>tcp-timeouts</b> <b>[initial</b> <b>idle</b> <b>keepalive</b> <b>advertised]</b>
              When   called   without   arguments,   this   command   displays   the   current   values  of  the
              <b>tcp-initial-timeout</b>, <b>tcp-idle-timeout</b>, <b>tcp-keepalive-timeout</b>, and <b>tcp-advertised-timeout</b>  options.
              When  called  with arguments, these values are updated. This allows an administrator to make rapid
              adjustments when under a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. See the descriptions of these options  in
              the BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual for details of their use.

       <b>thaw</b> <b>[zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]]</b>
              This  command  enables  updates to a frozen dynamic zone. If no zone is specified, then all frozen
              zones are enabled. This causes the server to reload the zone from  disk,  and  re-enables  dynamic
              updates  after  the  load  has  completed.  After  a zone is thawed, dynamic updates are no longer
              refused. If the zone has changed and the <b>ixfr-from-differences</b> option is in use, the journal  file
              is  updated  to  reflect  changes  in  the  zone. Otherwise, if the zone has changed, any existing
              journal file is removed.  If no zone is specified, the reloading happens asynchronously.

              See also <u>rndc</u> <u>freeze</u>.

       <b>trace</b> <b>[level]</b>
              If no level is specified, this command increments the server's debugging level by one.

              <b>level</b>  If specified, this command sets the server's debugging level to the provided value.

              See also <u>rndc</u> <u>notrace</u>.

       <b>validation</b> <b>(on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>|</b> <b>status)</b> <b>[view</b> <b>...]</b>
              This command enables, disables, or checks the current status of  DNSSEC  validation.  By  default,
              validation is enabled.

              The  cache  is  flushed  when validation is turned on or off to avoid using data that might differ
              between states.

       <b>zonestatus</b> <b>zone</b> <b>[class</b> <b>[view]]</b>
              This command displays the current status of the given zone, including the master file name and any
              include files from which it was loaded, when it was  most  recently  loaded,  the  current  serial
              number, the number of nodes, whether the zone supports dynamic updates, whether the zone is DNSSEC
              signed,  whether  it  uses  automatic  DNSSEC  key management or inline signing, and the scheduled
              refresh or expiry times for the zone.

              See also <u>rndc</u> <u>showzone</u>.

       <b>rndc</b> commands that specify zone names, such as <u>reload</u> <u>retransfer</u>, or <u>zonestatus</u>, can  be  ambiguous  when
       applied  to zones of type <b>redirect</b>. Redirect zones are always called <b>.</b>, and can be confused with zones of
       type <b>hint</b> or with secondary copies of the root zone. To specify a redirect zone,  use  the  special  zone
       name  <b>-redirect</b>,  without  a  trailing  period. (With a trailing period, this would specify a zone called
       "-redirect".)

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There is currently no way to provide the shared secret for a <b>server_key</b> without using  the  configuration
