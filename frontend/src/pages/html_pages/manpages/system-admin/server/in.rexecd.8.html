       rexecd — remote execution server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rexecd</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Rexecd</b>  is  the  server  for  the <u><a href="../man3/rexec.3.html">rexec</a></u>(3) routine.  The server provides remote execution facilities with
       authentication based on user names and passwords.

       <b>Rexecd</b> listens for service requests at the port indicated in  the  ``exec''  service  specification;  see
       <u><a href="../man5/services.5.html">services</a></u>(5).  When a service request is received the following protocol is initiated:

       1.   The  server  reads  characters  from  the  socket  up to a NUL (‘\0’) byte.  The resultant string is
            interpreted as an ASCII number, base 10.

       2.   If the number received in step 1 is non-zero, it is interpreted as the port number  of  a  secondary
            stream  to be used for the <u>stderr</u>.  A second connection is then created to the specified port on the
            client's machine.

       3.   A NUL terminated user name of at most 16 characters is retrieved on the initial socket.

       4.   A NUL terminated, unencrypted password of at most 16 characters is retrieved on the initial socket.

       5.   A NUL terminated command to be passed to a shell is retrieved on the initial socket.  The length  of
            the command is limited by the upper bound on the size of the system's argument list.

       6.   <b>Rexecd</b>  then  validates the user as is done at login time and, if the authentication was successful,
            changes to the user's home directory, and establishes the user and group protections  of  the  user.
            If any of these steps fail the connection is aborted with a diagnostic message returned.

       7.   A  NUL  byte  is  returned  on the initial socket and the command line is passed to the normal login
            shell of the user.  The shell inherits the network connections established by <b>rexecd</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Except for the last one listed below, all diagnostic messages are returned on the initial  socket,  after
       which  any  network connections are closed.  An error is indicated by a leading byte with a value of 1 (0
       is returned in step 7 above upon successful completion of all the steps prior to the command execution).

       <b>username</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b>
               The name is longer than 16 characters.

       <b>password</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b>
               The password is longer than 16 characters.

       <b>command</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b>
               The command line passed exceeds the size of the argument list (as configured into the system).

       <b>Login</b> <b>incorrect.</b>
               No password file entry for the user name existed or the wrong password was supplied.

       <b>No</b> <b>remote</b> <b>directory.</b>
               The <u>chdir</u> command to the home directory failed.

       <b>Try</b> <b>again.</b>
               A <u>fork</u> by the server failed.

       <b>&lt;shellname&gt;:</b> <b>...</b>
               The user's login shell could not  be  started.   This  message  is  returned  on  the  connection
               associated with the <u>stderr</u>, and is not preceded by a flag byte.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       A facility to allow all data and password exchanges to be encrypted should be present.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>rexecd</b> command appeared in 4.2BSD.
