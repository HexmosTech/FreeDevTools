</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SpamPD - Spam Proxy Daemon

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Documentation for SpamPD version 2.62.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>spampd</u> is an SMTP/LMTP proxy that marks (or tags) spam using SpamAssassin
       (&lt;<a href="http://www.SpamAssassin.org/">http://www.SpamAssassin.org/</a>&gt;). The proxy is designed to be transparent to the sending and receiving
       mail servers and at no point takes responsibility for the message itself. If a failure occurs within
       <u>spampd</u> (or SpamAssassin) then the mail servers will disconnect and the sending server is still
       responsible for retrying the message for as long as it is configured to do so.

       <u>spampd</u> uses SpamAssassin to modify (tag) relayed messages based on their spam score, so all SA settings
       apply. This is described in the SA documentation.  <u>spampd</u> will by default only tell SA to tag a message
       if it exceeds the spam threshold score, however you can have it rewrite all messages passing through by
       adding the --tagall option (see SA for how non-spam messages are tagged).

       <u>spampd</u> logs all aspects of its operation to <b><a href="../man8/syslog.8.html">syslog</a></b>(8), using the mail syslog facility.

       The latest version can be found at &lt;https://github.com/mpaperno/spampd&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIRES</b></h4><pre>
       Perl modules:

       <b>Mail::SpamAssassin</b>
       <b>Net::Server</b> (&gt;= v0.89, v2.009+ recommended) with <b>PreForkSimple</b> and/or <b>PreFork</b> submodules.
       <b>IO::File</b>
       <b>Time::HiRes</b>
       <b>IO::Socket::IP</b> (if using TCP/IP sockets)
       <b>IO::Socket::UNIX</b> (if using UNIX sockets)

</pre><h4><b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>spampd</u>  is  meant  to  operate as an S/LMTP mail proxy which passes each message through SpamAssassin for
       analysis.  Note that <u>spampd</u> does not do anything other than check for spam, so it is not suitable  as  an
       anti-relay  system.   It  is  meant  to work in conjunction with your regular mail system.  Typically one
       would pipe any messages they wanted scanned through <u>spampd</u> after initial  acceptance  by  your  MX  host.
       This  is  especially  useful  for  using  Postfix's  (<a href="http://www.postfix.org">http://www.postfix.org</a>)  advanced content filtering
       mechanism, although certainly not limited to that application.

       Please re-read the second sentence in the above paragraph.  You should NOT enable <u>spampd</u> to listen  on  a
       public  interface  (IP  address) unless you know exactly what you're doing!  It is very easy to set up an
       open relay this way.

       Here are some simple examples (square brackets in the "diagrams" indicate physical machines):

       <b>Running</b> <b>between</b> <b>firewall/gateway</b> <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> <b>mail</b> <b>server</b>
         The firewall/gateway MTA would be configured to forward all of its mail to the port that <u>spampd</u> listens
         on, and <u>spampd</u> would relay its messages to port 25 of your internal server. <u>spampd</u> could either run  on
         its  own  host  (and  listen on any port) or it could run on either mail server (and listen on any port
         except port 25).

           Internet -&gt;
           [ MX gateway (@inter.net.host:25) -&gt; spampd (@localhost:2025) ] -&gt;
           [ Internal mail (@private.host.ip:25) ]

       <b>Using</b> <b>Postfix</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>content</b> <b>filtering</b>
         Please see the <u>FILTER_README</u> that came with the Postfix distribution.  You need to have  a  version  of
         Postfix which supports this (ideally v.2 and up).

           Internet -&gt; [ Postfix (@inter.net.host:25)  -&gt;
                         spampd (@localhost:10025)     -&gt;
                         Postfix (@localhost:10026)  ] -&gt; final delivery

       Note  that  these  examples only show incoming mail delivery.  Since it is often unnecessary to scan mail
       coming from your network, it may be desirable to set up a separate outbound route which bypasses <u>spampd</u>.

   <b>Scalable</b> <b>Mode</b>
       Since v2.60 <u>spampd</u> can optionally run in "scalable mode" which dynamically adjusts the  number  of  child
       servers which can process requests simultaneously. This is activated automatically if the "--min-servers"
       option is specifically set to be lower than "--max-servers".

       Historically  <u>SpamPD</u>  inherited from the module <u>Net::Server::PreForkSimple</u> which only allows for a static
       number of child servers to be running at once. This new option essentially  allows  for  inheriting  from
       <u>Net::Server::PreFork</u>  which  features  dynamic allocation of child servers, with some tunable parameters.
       (The reason <u>PreFork</u> wasn't used to begin with is because older versions of it didn't seem to work...   it
       was an old TODO to try again later.)

       Here is what the <u>Net::Server::PreFork</u> documentation has to say (option names changed to match <u>spampd</u>):

       <u>"This</u>  <u>personality</u>  <u>binds</u>  <u>to</u> <u>one</u> <u>or</u> <u>more</u> <u>ports</u> <u>and</u> <u>then</u> <u>forks</u> <u>"--min-servers"</u> <u>child</u> <u>process.</u>  <u>The</u> <u>server</u>
       <u>will</u> <u>make</u> <u>sure</u> <u>that</u> <u>at</u> <u>any</u> <u>given</u> <u>time</u> <u>there</u> <u>are</u> <u>"--min-spare"</u>  <u>servers</u>  <u>available</u>  <u>to</u>  <u>receive</u>  <u>a</u>  <u>client</u>
       <u>request,</u>  <u>up</u>  <u>to</u>  <u>"--max-servers".</u>  <u>Each</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>these</u>  <u>children</u>  <u>will</u>  <u>process</u> <u>up</u> <u>to</u> <u>"--maxrequests"</u> <u>client</u>
       <u>connections.</u> <u>This</u> <u>type</u> <u>is</u> <u>good</u> <u>for</u> <u>a</u> <u>heavily</u> <u>hit</u> <u>site,</u> <u>and</u> <u>should</u> <u>scale</u> <u>well</u> <u>for</u> <u>most</u> <u>applications."</u>

       Some experimentation and tuning will likely be needed to get the best performance vs. efficiency. Keep in
       mind that a SIGHUP sent to the parent process will reload configuration files and restart  child  servers
       gracefully (handy for tuning a busy site).

       See the documentation for "--min-servers", "--max-servers", "--min-spare", and "--max-spare" options, and
       also  the  section  about  "Other  Net::Server  Options"  for  tuning  parameters  and  links  to further
       documentation.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>spampd</u> can be run directly from the command prompt if desired.  This is useful for testing purposes,  but
       for long term use you probably want to put it somewhere like <a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a> or <a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a> and execute it at
       system  startup.   For  example on Red Hat-style Linux system one can use a script in /etc/rc.d/init.d to
       start <u>spampd</u> (a sample script &lt;https://github.com/mpaperno/spampd/tree/master/misc&gt; is available  in  the
       <u>spampd</u> code repository).

       <u>spampd</u>  is  available  as a <b>package</b> for a significant number of Linux distributions, including Debian and
       derivatives (Ubuntu, etc). This is typically the easiest/best way to install and configure  <u>spampd</u>  since
       it  should  already  take  into account any system specifics for setting up and running as a daemon, etc.
       Note however that packages might not offer the latest version of <u>spampd</u>. A good reference  for  available
       packages and their versions can be found at &lt;https://repology.org/project/spampd/versions&gt;.

       <u>spampd</u>  is  also  used  in  the turnkey Mail-in-a-Box &lt;https://mailinabox.email/&gt; project, which includes
       Postfix as the main MTA and Dovecot as the local delivery agent with LMTP protocol.  Even  if  you  don't
       need  the turnkey solution, it may be informative to peruse the MIAB setup &lt;https://github.com/mail-in-a-
       box/mailinabox/tree/master/setup&gt;         /         configuration          &lt;https://github.com/mail-in-a-
       box/mailinabox/tree/master/conf&gt; files for reference.

       All <u>spampd</u> options have reasonable defaults, especially for a Postfix-centric installation.  You may want
       to  specify  the "--max-servers" option if you have an especially beefy or weak server box because <u>spampd</u>
       is a memory-hungry program.  Check the "Options" for details on this and all other parameters.

       To show default values for all options, run "spampd --show defaults".

       <b>Since</b>       <b>v2.61</b>       <u>spampd</u>       injects       a       "_SPAMPDVERSION_"        "template        tag"
       &lt;https://spamassassin.apache.org/doc/Mail_SpamAssassin_Conf.html#TEMPLATE-TAGS&gt;    macro    at    message
       processing time. This can be used in an "add_header" SA config file directive, for example.

         add_header all Filter-Version SpamAssassin _VERSION_ (_SUBVERSION_, Rules: _RULESVERSION_) / SpamPD _SPAMPDVERSION_

       Note that  <u><b>spampd</b></u> <b>replaces</b> <u><b>spamd</b></u>  from the <u>SpamAssassin</u> distribution in function. You do not need to  run
       <u>spamd</u>  in  order  for  <u>spampd</u> to work.  This has apparently been the source of some confusion, so now you
       know.

   <b>Postfix-specific</b> <b>Notes</b>
       Here is a typical setup for Postfix "advanced" content filtering as described in the  <u>FILTER_README</u>  that
       came with the Postfix distribution (which you really need to read):

       <u>/etc/postfix/master.cf</u>:

         smtp             inet  n  -  y  -  -   smtpd
           -o content_filter=smtp:localhost:10025
           -o myhostname=mx.example.com

         localhost:10026  inet  n  -  n  -  10  smtpd
           -o content_filter=
           -o myhostname=mx-int.example.com

       The  first  entry  is the main public-facing MTA which uses localhost:10025 as the content filter for all
       mail. The second entry receives mail from the  content  filter  and  does  final  delivery.   Both  smtpd
       instances  use  the same Postfix <u>main.cf</u> file.  <u>spampd</u> is the process that listens on localhost:10025 and
       then connects to the Postfix listener on localhost:10026.  Note that the  "myhostname"  options  must  be
       different  between  the  two  instances,  otherwise  Postfix  will think it's talking to itself and abort
       sending.

       For the above example you can simply start <u>spampd</u> like this:

        spampd --host=localhost:10025 --relayhost=localhost:10026

       <u>FILTER_README</u> from the Postfix distro has more details and examples of various setups, including  how  to
       skip the content filter for outbound mail.

       Another  tip  for  Postfix  when considering what timeout values to use for --childtimout and --satimeout
       options is the following command:

       "# postconf | grep timeout"

       This will return a list of useful timeout settings and their values.  For explanations see  the  relevant
       "man" page (smtp, smtpd, lmtp).  By default <u>spampd</u> is set up for the default Postfix timeout values.

       The  following  guide  has  some  more specific setup instructions: <b>Integrating</b> <b>SpamAssassin</b> <b>into</b> <b>Postfix</b>
       <b>using</b> <b>spampd</b> <b>&lt;https://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/IntegratePostfixViaSpampd&gt;</b>

</pre><h4><b>UPGRADING</b></h4><pre>
       Always consult the <u>changelog.txt</u> file which should be included in the <u>spampd</u> repository/distribution.

       If upgrading from a version <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>2.2</b>, please note  that  the  --add-sc-header  option  is  no  longer
       supported.  Use SA's built-in header manipulation features instead (as of SA v2.6).

       Upgrading  from  <b>version</b>  <b>1</b>  simply involves replacing the <u>spampd</u> program file with the latest one.  Note
       that the <u>dead-letters</u> folder is no longer being used and the --dead-letters option is  no  longer  needed
       (though no errors are thrown if it's present).  Check the "OPTIONS" list below for a full list of new and
       deprecated options.  Also be sure to check out the change log.

       <b>Since</b>  <b>v2.60</b>  <u>spampd</u>  has  a new "Scalable Mode" feature which varies the number of running child servers
       based on demand. This is disabled by default. The option previosly known as "--children" (or "-c") is now
       called "--max-servers" (or "-mxs"), but the old  style  is  still  accepted.   See  descriptions  of  the
       "max-servers" and "min-servers" options for details.

       Also note that v2.60 added the ability to use a "CONFIGURATION FILE" for specifying all options.

       Options  are  case-insensitive.  "=" can be used as name/value separator instead of space (--name=value).
       "-" or "--" prefix can be used for all options. Shortest unique option name can be used. All options must
       be listed individually (no "bundling"). All boolean options can take an optional argument of 1 or  0,  or
       can  be  negated  by  adding a "no-" prefix in front of the name. An option specified on the command line
       overrides the same option loaded from config file(s).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Please be sure to also read the general information  about  specifying  option  arguments  in  the  above
       "USAGE" section.

       To view <b>default</b> <b>values</b> for all options, run "spampd --show defaults".

       <b>--config</b> or <b>-cfg</b> or <b>--config-file</b> or <b>--cfg-file</b> <u>&lt;filename</u>&gt; "new in v2.60"
            Load  options  from  one or more configuration file(s). This option can be specified multiple times.
            The "filename" can also be a list of files separated by a ":" (colon). If multiple files specify the
            same option, the last one loaded will take precedence. Also any  options  specified  on  the  actual
            command  line  will  take  precedence  (regardless  of  where they appear relative to the "--config"
            option).  <b>--config</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>specified</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b>,  one  cannot  use  it  within  another
            configuration file.

            See "CONFIGURATION FILE" section for more details.

       <b>--host</b> <u>(&lt;ip&gt;|&lt;hostname&gt;)[:&lt;port&gt;]</u>
            Specifies  what  hostname/IP  and  port  <u>spampd</u>  listens  on.  By  default,  it listens on 127.0.0.1
            (localhost) on port 10025.

            As of v2.60 this option can also handle IPv6 addresses in the form of "--host n:n:n" or, with  port,
            "--host  [n:n:n]:port" (the square brackets are optional in both forms but recommended in the latter
            case).

            Note that the <u>port</u> specified this way implicitly overrides the "--port" option.

            <b>Important!</b> You should NOT enable <u>spampd</u> to listen on a public interface (IP address) unless you know
            exactly what you're doing!

       <b>--port</b> <u>&lt;n</u>&gt;
            Specifies what port <u>spampd</u> listens on. This is an alternate  to  using  the  above  "--host=ip:port"
            notation. Note that a <u>port</u> specified in the "--host" option will override this one.

       <b>--socket</b> <u>&lt;socketpath</u>&gt;
            Specifies what UNIX socket <u>spampd</u> listens on. If this is specified, --host and --port are ignored.

       <b>--socket-perms</b> <u>&lt;mode</u>&gt;
            The  file mode for the created UNIX socket (see --socket) in octal format, e.g. 700 to specify acces
            only for the user <u>spampd</u> is run as.

       <b>--relayhost</b> <u>(&lt;ip&gt;|&lt;hostname&gt;)[:&lt;port&gt;]</u>
            Specifies the hostname/IP to which <u>spampd</u> will relay all messages. Defaults to 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
            on port 25.

            As of v2.60 this option can also handle IPv6 addresses in the form of "--relayhost n:n:n"  or,  with
            port,  "--relayhost [n:n:n]:port" (the square brackets are optional in both forms but recommended in
            the latter case).

            Note that the <u>port</u> specified this way implicitly overrides the "--relayport" option.

       <b>--relayport</b> <u>&lt;n</u>&gt;
            Specifies  what  port  <u>spampd</u>  will  relay  to.  This  is  an   alternate   to   using   the   above
            --relayhost=ip:port  notation.  Note that a <u>port</u> specified in the "--relayhost" option will override
            this one.

       <b>--relaysocket</b> <u>&lt;socketpath</u>&gt;
            Specifies what UNIX socket spampd will relay to. If this is specified  --relayhost  and  --relayport
            will be ignored.

       <b>--user</b> or <b>-u</b> <u>&lt;username</u>&gt;
       <b>--group</b> or <b>-g</b> <u>&lt;groupname</u>&gt;
            Specifies the user and/or group that the proxy will run as. Default is <u>mail</u>/<u>mail</u>.

       <b>--children</b> or <b>-c</b> <u>&lt;n</u>&gt;
       <b>--max-servers</b> or <b>-mxs</b> <u>&lt;n</u>&gt; "new in v2.60"
            Number  of  child  servers  to  start  and  maintain  (where  n  &gt; 0). Each child will process up to
            "--maxrequests" (below) before exiting and being replaced by another child.  Keep this number low on
            systems w/out a lot of memory.  Note that there is always  a  parent  process  running,  so  if  you
            specify 5 children you will actually have 6 <u>spampd</u> processes running.

            <b>Note:</b>  If "--min-servers" option is also set, and is less than "--max-servers", then the server runs
            in "Scalable Mode" and the meaning of this option changes.  In scalable mode, the number  of  actual
            running servers will fluctuate between "--min-servers" and "--max-servers", based on demand.

            You  may  want  to set your origination mail server to limit the number of concurrent connections to
            <u>spampd</u> to match this setting (for Postfix this is the  "xxxx_destination_concurrency_limit"  setting
            where 'xxxx' is the transport being used, usually 'smtp' or 'lmtp').

            See also "--min-servers", "--min-spare", and "--max-spare" options.

       <b>--min-servers</b> or <b>-mns</b> <u>&lt;n</u>&gt; "new in v2.60"
            Minimum number of child servers to start and maintain (where n &gt; 0).

            <b>Note:</b>  If  this  option  is set, and it is less than "--max-servers" option, then the server runs in
            "Scalable Mode". By default this option is undefined, meaning <u>spampd</u>  runs  only  a  set  number  of
            servers  specified  in "--max-servers".  In scalable mode, the number of actual running servers will
            fluctuate between "--min-servers" and "--max-servers", based on demand.

            See also "--max-servers", "--min-spare", and "--max-spare" options.

       <b>--min-spare</b> or <b>-mnsp</b> <u>&lt;n</u>&gt; "new in v2.60"
            The minimum number of servers to have waiting for requests.  Minimum and maximum numbers should  not
            be  set  to  close to each other or the server will fork and kill children too often. (<u>-</u> <u>Copied</u> <u>from</u>
            <u>"Net::Server::PreFork"</u>)

            <b>Note:</b>  This  option  is  only  used  when  running  in  "Scalable  Mode".  See  "--min-servers"  and
            "--max-servers" options.

       <b>--max-spare</b> or <b>-mxsp</b> <u>&lt;n</u>&gt; "new in v2.60"
            The maximum number of servers to have waiting for requests. (<u>-</u> <u>Copied</u> <u>from</u> <u>"Net::Server::PreFork"</u>)

            <b>Note:</b>  This  option  is  only  used  when  running  in  "Scalable  Mode".  See  "--min-servers"  and
            "--max-servers" options.

       <b>--maxrequests</b> or <b>-mr</b> or <b>-r</b> <u>&lt;n</u>&gt;
            <u>spampd</u> works by forking child servers to handle each message. The  <b>maxrequests</b>  parameter  specifies
            how  many  requests will be handled before the child exits. Since a child never gives back memory, a
            large message can cause it to become quite bloated; the only way to reclaim the memory  is  for  the
            child to exit.

       <b>--childtimeout</b> <u>&lt;n</u>&gt;
            This  is  the  number of seconds to allow each child server before it times out a transaction. In an
            S/LMTP transaction the timer is reset for every command.  This timeout includes time it  would  take
            to send the message data, so it should not be too short.  Note that it's more likely the origination
            or destination mail servers will timeout first, which is fine.  This is just a "sane" failsafe.

       <b>--satimeout</b> <u>&lt;n</u>&gt;
            This is the number of seconds to allow for processing a message with SpamAssassin (including feeding
            it the message, analyzing it, and adding the headers/report if necessary).

            This  should  be  less  than your origination and destination servers' timeout settings for the DATA
            command. (For Postfix this is set in "(smtp|lmtp)_data_done_timeout" and  "smtpd_timeout").  In  the
            event  of  timeout  while processing the message, the problem is logged and the message is passed on
            anyway (w/out spam tagging, obviously).  To fail the message with a temp 450 error, see the "--dose"
            (die-on-sa-errors) option, below.

       <b>--child-name-template</b> or <b>-cnt</b> <u>[&lt;template</u>]&gt; "new in v2.61"
            Template for formatting child process name. Use a blank string (just the  argument  name  without  a
            value) to leave the child process name unchanged (will be same as parent command line).

            The  template  uses  printf()  style formatting, but with named parameter placeholders.  For example
            (wrapped for clarity):

              %base_name: child #%child_count(%child_status)
              [req %req_count/%req_max, time lst/avg/ttl %(req_time_last).4f/%(req_time_avg).4f/%(req_time_ttl).4f,
              ham/spm %req_ham/%req_spam, rules v%sa_rls_ver)]'

            Would produce something like:

              spampd: child #4(D) [req 8/30, time lst/avg/ttl 0.0222/0.0256/0.2045, ham/spm 3/5, rules v1891891]

            Parameters are specified like:  "Value  of  %(my_name)s  is  %(my_float_value).4f",  with  names  in
            parenthesis  followed  by a standard printf() style formatting specifier ("s" is default), or simply
            as "Value of %my_name is %my_value" with the default format  being  a  string  (works  for  numerics
            also).  Keep in mind that any actual "%" characters need to be escaped as "%%".  Formatting warnings
            will be logged as "sprintf" errors (most likely a parameter was misspelled).

            The following variables are available:

                base_name     # Base script name, eg. "spampd"
                spampd_ver    # SpamPD version, eg. "2.61"
                perl_ver      # Perl version, eg. "5.28.1"
                ns_ver        # Net::Server version, eg. "2.009"
                ns_typ        # Net::Server type, "PreFork" or "PreForkSimple"
                ns_typ_acr    # Net::Server type acronym, "PF" or "PFS"
                sa_ver        # SpamAassassin version, eg. "3.4.2"
                sa_rls_ver    # SpamAassassin rules update version, eg. "1891891" or "(unknown)"
                child_count   # total number of children launched so far (current child number)
                child_status  # child status, "C" for connected, or "D" for disconnected
                req_count     # number of requests child has processed so far
                req_max       # maximum child requests before exit
                req_time_last # [s] time to process the last message
                req_time_ttl  # [s] total processing time for this child
                req_time_avg  # [s] average processing time for this child (req_time_ttl / req_count)
                req_ham       # count of ham messages scored by child
                req_spam      # count of spam messages scored by child

       <b>--pid</b> or <b>-p</b> <u>&lt;filename</u>&gt;
            Specifies a filename where <u>spampd</u> will write its process ID so that it is easy to kill it later. The
            directory that will contain this file must be writable by the <u>spampd</u> user.

       <b>--logfile</b> or <b>-o</b> <u>(syslog|stderr|&lt;filename&gt;)</u> "new in v2.60"
            Logging method to use. May be one or more of:

            •    "syslog": Use the system's syslogd (via Sys::Syslog). <b>Default</b> setting.

            •    "stderr": Direct all logging to stderr (if running in background mode these may still end up in
                 the default system log).

            •    "filename": Use the specified file (the location must be  accessible  to  the  user  <u>spampd</u>  is
                 running  as).  This can also be a device handle, eg: "/dev/tty0" or even "/dev/null" to disable
                 logging entirely.

            <b>This</b> <b>option</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>specified</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>times.</b> You may also specify multiple destination by separating
            them with a ":" (colon): "--logfile stderr:/var/log/spampd.log"

            Simultaneous logging to "syslog", "stderr", and one "filename" is possible.  At this time  only  one
            log file can be used at a time (if several are specified then the last one takes precedence).

       <b>--logsock</b> or <b>-ls</b> <u>&lt;type</u>&gt; "new in v2.20"  "updated in v2.60"
            Syslog socket to use if "--logfile" is set to <u>syslog</u>.

            "Since v2.60:"

            The  <u>type</u>  can  be  any  of  the  socket  types  or logging mechanisms as accepted by the subroutine
            <b>Sys::Syslog::setlogsock()</b>. Depending on the version of  Sys::Syslog  and  the  underlying  operating
            system, one of the following values (or their subset) can be used:

              native, tcp, udp, inet, unix, stream, pipe, console, eventlog (Win32 only)

            The  default  behavior since <u>spampd</u> v2.60 is to let <u>Sys::Syslog</u> pick the default syslog socket. This
            is the recommended usage for <u>Sys::Syslog</u> (since v0.15), which chooses thusly:

              The default is to try native, tcp, udp, unix, pipe, stream, console. Under systems with the
              Win32 API, eventlog will be added as the first mechanism to try if Win32::EventLog is available.

            For  more  information  please  consult   the   Sys::Syslog   &lt;https://metacpan.org/pod/Sys::Syslog&gt;
            documentation.

            To preserve backwards-compatibility, the default on HP-UX and SunOS (Solaris) systems is "inet".

            "Prior to v2.60:"

            The default was "unix" except on HP-UX and SunOS (Solaris) systems it is "inet".

       <b>--logident</b> or <b>-li</b> <u>&lt;name</u>&gt; "new in v2.60"
            Syslog identity name to use. This may also be used in log files written directly (w/out syslog).

       <b>--logfacility</b> or <b>-lf</b> <u>&lt;name</u>&gt; "new in v2.60"
            Syslog  facility  name  to use. This is typically the name of the system-wide log file to be written
            to.

       <b>--[no]detach</b> <u>[0|1]</u> "new in v2.20"
            Tells <u>spampd</u> to detach  from  the  console  and  fork  into  the  background  ("daemonize").   Using
            "--nodetach" can be useful for running under control of some daemon management tools or testing from
            a command line.

       <b>--[no]setsid</b> <u>[0|1]</u> "new in v2.51"
            If  "--setsid"  is  specified then <u>spampd</u> will fork after the bind method to release itself from the
            command line and then run the <b>POSIX::setsid()</b> command to truly daemonize. Only used if  "--nodetach"
            isn't specified.

       <b>--maxsize</b> <u>&lt;n</u>&gt;
            The maximum message size to send to SpamAssassin, in KBytes. Messages over this size are not scanned
            at  all,  and  an  appropriate  message  is  logged  indicating this.  The size includes headers and
            attachments (if any).

       <b>--dose</b> <u>[0|1]</u>
            Acronym for (d)ie (o)n (s)pamAssassin (e)rrors. When disabled and <u>spampd</u> encounters a  problem  with
            processing the message through SpamAssassin (timeout or other error), it will still pass the mail on
            to  the destination server.  When enabled, the mail is instead rejected with a temporary error (code
            450, which means the  origination  server  should  keep  retrying  to  send  it).  See  the  related
            "--satimeout" option, above.

       <b>--tagall</b> or <b>-a</b> <u>[0|1]</u>
            Tells  <u>spampd</u> to have SpamAssassin add headers to all scanned mail, not just spam.  Otherwise <u>spampd</u>
            will only rewrite messages which exceed the spam threshold score (as defined in  the  SA  settings).
            Note  that  for  this  option to work as of SA-2.50, the <u>always_add_report</u> and/or <u>always_add_headers</u>
            settings in your SpamAssassin <u>local.cf</u> need to be set to 1/true.

       <b>--log-rules-hit</b> or <b>-rh</b> <u>[0|1]</u>
            Logs the names of each SpamAssassin rule which matched the message being processed.   This  list  is
            returned by SA.

       <b>--set-envelope-headers</b> or <b>-seh</b> <u>[0|1]</u> "new in v2.30"
            Turns  on  addition of X-Envelope-To and X-Envelope-From headers to the mail being scanned before it
            is passed to SpamAssassin. The idea is to help SA process any blacklist/whitelist to/from directives
            on the actual sender/recipients instead of the possibly bogus  envelope  headers.  This  potentially
            exposes  the  list of all recipients of that mail (even BCC'd ones).  Therefore usage of this option
            is discouraged.

            <u>NOTE</u>: Even though <u>spampd</u> tries to prevent this leakage by removing the  X-Envelope-To  header  after
            scanning, SpamAssassin itself might add headers that report recipient(s) listed in X-Envelope-To.

       <b>--set-envelope-from</b> or <b>-sef</b> <u>[0|1]</u> "new in v2.30"
            Same  as above option but only enables the addition of X-Envelope-From header.  For those that don't
            feel comfortable with  the  possible  information  exposure  of  X-Envelope-To.   The  above  option
            overrides this one.

       <b>--local-only</b> or <b>-L</b> <u>[0|1]</u>
            Turn off all SA network-based tests (DNS, Razor, etc).

       <b>--homedir</b> <u>&lt;directory</u>&gt; "new in v2.40"
            Use  the  specified directory as home directory for the spamassassin process.  Things like the auto-
            whitelist and other plugin (razor/pyzor) files get written to here. A good place for this is in  the
            same  place  your  "bayes_path"  SA  config setting points to (if any).  Make sure this directory is
            accessible to the user that spampd is running as.

            Thanks to Alexander Wirt for this fix.

       <b>--saconfig</b> <u>&lt;filename</u>&gt;
            Use the specified file for SpamAssassin configuration options in addition to  the  default  local.cf
            file.  Any options specified here will override the same option from local.cf.

       <b>--debug</b> or <b>-d</b> <u>[&lt;area,...&gt;|1|0]</u> "(updated in v2.60)"
            Turns on SpamAssassin debug messages which print to the system mail log (same log as spampd will log
            to).   Also  turns  on more verbose logging of what spampd is doing (new in v2).  Also increases log
            level of Net::Server to 4 (debug), adding yet more info (but not too much) (new in v2.2).

            "New in v2.60:"

            Setting the value to 1 (one) is the same as using no parameter (eg. simply  <u>-d</u>).   The  value  of  0
            (zero) disables debug logging.

            The <u>area</u> list is passed on directly to SpamAssassin and controls logging facilities. If no <u>area</u>s are
            listed  (and  debug  logging  is  enabled), all debugging information is printed (this equivalent to
            passing "all" as the <u>area</u>).  Diagnostic output can also be enabled for each area individually;  <u>area</u>
            is  the  area  of the code to instrument. For example, to produce diagnostic output on bayes, learn,
            and dns, use:

                -d bayes,learn,dns

            You can also disable specific areas with the "no" prefix:

                -d all,norules,nobayes

            To show only <u>spampd</u> debug messages (none from SpamAssassin), use:

                -d spampd

       <b>--show</b> <u>&lt;thing</u>&gt;[,<u>&lt;thing</u>&gt;[,...]] "new in v2.60"
            Meant  primarily for debugging configuration settings (or code), this will print some information to
            the console and then exit.

            <u>&lt;thing</u>&gt; may be one or more of:

            •   "defaults": Show default values for all options, in a format suitable for a config file.

            •   "config": Shows option values after  processing  all  given  command-line  arguments,  including
                anything loaded from config file(s).

            •   "start": Shows the final configuration arguments after processing any config file(s).

            •   "version":  Same  as  "--version"  switch  but  runs  after parsing all options and shows actual
                <u>Net::Server</u> type which would be used (<u>PreFork</u> or <u>PreForkSimple</u>).

            •   "argv": Shows anything remaining on command line (@ARGV) after processing  all  known  arguments
                (this will be passed onto Net::Server).

            •   "self": Dumps the whole SpamPD object, including all settings. Trés geek.

            •   "all": Prints all of the above.

            Multiple  "thing"s  may  be  specified  by using the <u>--show</u> option multiple times, or separating the
            items with a comma: "--show config,start,argv".

            Note that all <u>thing</u> options besides "defaults" and "config" require  the  Perl  module  <u>Data::Dumper</u>
            installed.

       <b>--version</b> "new in v2.52"
            Prints version information about SpamPD, Net::Server, SpamAssassin, and Perl.

       <b>--help</b> or <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> <u>[txt]</u>
       <b>--hh</b> or <b>-??</b> <u>[txt]</u>
       <b>--hhh</b> or <b>-???</b> <u>[txt]</u>
       <b>--man</b> or <b>-hhhh</b> or <b>-????</b> <u>[html|txt]</u>
            Prints  increasingly  verbose  usage information. By default help is displayed in "terminal" (groff)
            format with some text styling applied. If you want to use "less" as a pager,  provide  it  with  the
            "-R" switch, eg.:

              spampd --??? | less -R

            Alternatively you can request plain-text format with the optional "txt" value.

            "--man"  displays  the full documentation, optionally in "html" or plain text "txt" formats (default
            is to use actual "man" format/display). HTML version is saved to a temp file and an attempt is  made
            to  open  it  in  the  default  system  browser  (it is better if the browser is already opened). If
            available, the optional Perl module <u>HTML::Display</u> is used to (try to) open a browser.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Net::Server</b> <b>Options</b>
       <u>Net::Server</u> supports some other options which <u>spampd</u> doesn't accept  directly.   For  example  there  are
       access  control  options,  child  process tuning, and a few more (see below).  Such options can be passed
       through to <u>Net::Server</u> (and subtypes) by specifying them at the end of the <u>spampd</u> command line (or  in  a
       configuration  file)  following two dashes " -- " by themselves (this is a failry typicaly convention for
       passing options onto another program). As an example, it may look something like this:

         spampd --host 10.0.0.1 -port 10025 -- --cidr_allow 10.0.0.0/24

       The "--cidr_allow" after the " -- " is passed onto <u>Net::Server</u>. If the " -- " were not there,  you  would
       get an error from <u>spampd</u> about an unknown option.

       To  specify  <u>Net::Server</u> options in a configuration file, place them after two dashes ("--") on a line by
       themselves. See "CONFIGURATION FILE" for an example.

       This only makes sense with the few options not directly controlled by/through <u>spampd</u>.  As of  <u>Net::Server</u>
       v2.009 the list is:

         reverse_lookups, allow, deny, cidr_allow, cidr_deny, chroot, ipv, conf_file,
         serialize, lock_file, check_for_dead, max_dequeue, check_for_dequeue

       If  running in "Scalable Mode" then these settings from <u>Net::Server::PreFork</u> can also be very relevant to
       performance tuning:

         check_for_waiting, check_for_spawn, min_child_ttl

       Keep in mind that the <u>Net::Server</u> types inherit from each other: "PreFork" inherits from  "PreForkSimple"
       which inherits from "Net::Server" itself. Which means all the options are also inherited.

       See  the <b>Net::<a href="../man3/Server.3.html">Server</a></b>(3) &lt;https://https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Server#DEFAULT-ARGUMENTS-FOR-Net::Server&gt;,
       <b>Net::Server::<a href="../man3/PreForkSimple.3.html">PreForkSimple</a></b>(3)          &lt;https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Server::PreForkSimple#COMMAND-LINE-
       ARGUMENTS&gt;,   and   <b>Net::Server::<a href="../man3/PreFork.3.html">PreFork</a></b>(3)  &lt;https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Server::PreFork#COMMAND-LINE-
       ARGUMENTS&gt; documentation for details.

   <b>Deprecated</b> <b>Options</b>
       The following options are no longer used but still accepted for  backwards  compatibility  with  prevoius
       <u>spampd</u> versions:

       <b>--dead-letters</b>
       <b>--heloname</b>
       <b>--stop-at-threshold</b>
       <b>--add-sc-header</b>
       <b>--hostname</b>
       <b>--auto-whitelist</b> or <b>-aw</b> "deprecated with SpamAssassin v3+"
            This  option  is no longer relevant with SA version 3.0 and above, which controls auto whitelist use
            via config file settings. Do not use it unless you must use an older SA version. An  error  will  be
            generated if attempting to use this option with SA 3.0 or above.

            For  SA  version  &lt;  3.0, turns on the SpamAssassin global whitelist feature.  See the SA docs. Note
            that per-user whitelists are not available.

            <b>NOTE</b>: <b>DBBasedAddrList</b> is used as the storage mechanism. If you wish to  use  a  different  mechanism
            (such  as  SQLBasedAddrList),  the  <u>spampd</u>  code will need to be modified in 2 instances (search the
            source for DBBasedAddrList).

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Since v2.60 <u>spampd</u> allows for the use of a configuration file to load server  parameters.   One  or  more
       files  can  be  specified  on  the  command line (see "--config" option for more details on syntax).  The
       format of a configuration file is simple key/value pairs. Comments (starting with # or ;) and blank lines
       are ignored. The option names are exactly as they appear above in the "OPTIONS"  section.   They  can  be
       listed with or w/out the "-"/"--" prefixes.  Key/value separator can be one or more of space, tab, or "="
       (equal) sign.

       Multiple  configuration  files  can be loaded, with the latter ones being able to override options loaded
       earlier. Any options specified on the command line  will  take  precedence  over  options  from  file(s).
       Configuration  file(s)  are  reloaded during a HUP-induced restart (see "SIGNALS"), making it possible to
       adjust settings dynamically on a running server.

       You may also provide "<b>passthrough</b>" options directly to <u>Net::Server</u> by putting them after a "--" on a line
       by itself (this is just like using the lonesome "--" on a command line; see "Other Net::Server Options").

       Note that one cannot use the "--config" option to load a file from within another file. <b>A</b> <b>config</b> <b>file</b> <b>can</b>
       <b>only</b> <b>be</b> <b>specified</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>line.</b>

       Use the "spampd --show defaults &gt; spampd.config" command to generate a sample configuration file  showing
       all default values. The example below demonstrates various valid syntax for the file.

         # Sample configuration file for SpamPD.

         # Double dashes
         --user    spampd

         # Single dash and = separator with spaces
         -pid = /var/run/spampd/spampd.pid

         # No dashes required, equals separator no spaces
         homedir=/var/cache/spampd

         # No dashes, space separator
         host  127.0.0.1

         # Disabled option (after comment character)
         #port  10025

         # Boolean values can be set/unset a number of ways:
         tagall      1
         local-only  0
         set-envelope-from
         no-log-rules-hit

         # Passthrough arguments for Net::Server[::PreFork[Simple]] could go here.
         # Be sure to also uncomment the "--" if using any.
         # --
         # cidr_allow      127.0.0.1/32

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       HUP  "updated in v2.60"
            Sending  HUP  signal  to  the  master  process will restart all the children gracefully (meaning the
            currently running requests will shut down once the request is complete).

            "Since v2.60":

            SpamAssassin configuration IS reloaded on HUP. Any children currently in the middle of a transaction
            will finish with the previous SA config and then exit. A new set of children, using the new  config,
            is spawned immediately upon HUP and will serve any new requests.

            In  a  similar  manner,  <u>spampd</u>  will  also  reload  its own settings from any configuration file(s)
            specified on the original command line with "--config"  option  (see  "OPTIONS"  and  "CONFIGURATION
            FILE").

            "Since v2.52": Children were restarted but SpamAssassin configuration was not reloaded.

            "Prior to v2.52": HUP would try to restart the server with all default settings (usually failing).

       TTIN, TTOU
            Sending  TTIN  signal to the master process will dynamically increase the number of children by one,
            and TTOU signal will decrease it by one.

       INT, TERM
            Sending INT or TERM signal to the master process will kill all the  children  immediately  and  shut
            down the daemon.

       QUIT Sending QUIT signal to the master process will perform a graceful shutdown, waiting for all children
            to finish processing any current transactions and then shutting down the parent process.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Running between firewall/gateway and internal mail server:
            <u>spampd</u> listens on port 10025 on the same host as the internal mail server.

              spampd --host=192.168.1.10

            Same  as  above  but  <u>spampd</u>  runs on port 10025 of the same host as the firewall/gateway and passes
            messages on to the internal mail server on another host.

              spampd --relayhost=192.168.1.10

       Using Postfix advanced content filtering example and disable SA network checks:
              spampd --port=10025 --relayhost=127.0.0.1:10026 --local-only

       Using UNIX sockets instead if INET ports:
            <u>spampd</u> listens on the UNIX socket "/var/run/spampd.socket" with persmissions 700 instead  of  a  TCP
            port:

              spampd --socket /var/run/spampd.socket --socket-perms 700

            <u>spampd</u> will relay mail to "/var/run/dovecot/lmtp" instead of a TCP port:

              spampd --relaysocket /var/run/dovecot/lmtp

            Remember that the user <u>spampd</u> runs as needs to have read AND write permissions on the relaysocket!
