</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hfaxd - <u>HylaFAX</u> client-server protocol server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/usr/sbin/hfaxd</b>  [ <b>-d</b> ] [ <b>-q</b> <u>dir</u> ] [ <b>-o</b> <u>port</u> ] [ <b>-O</b> ] [ <b>-l</b> <u>bindaddress</u> ] [ <b>-i</b> <u>port</u> ] [ <b>-I</b> ] [ <b>-s</b> <u>port</u> ] [
       <b>-S</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>hfaxd</u> is the <u>HylaFAX</u> program that implements the server portion of:

       •  the client-server protocol and

       •  the Simple Network Paging Protocol (SNPP) used to submit message pager jobs to  the  IXO/TAP  and  UCP
          support.

       Additional  client-server protocols are planned and <u>hfaxd</u> is intended to be the ``carrier'' through which
       they are supported.

       <u>hfaxd</u> is typically used in one of two ways; either as a standalone process that is started at system boot
       time to listen for client connections on one or more ports (in which case the -i, -o, or -s  option  must
       be  used),  or  as  a  subservient  process to the <u><a href="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd</a></u>(8) program.  The two forms of use may however be
       combined so long as the same service is not provided both by the standalone <u>hfaxd</u> and through <u>inetd</u>.

</pre><h4><b>HYLAFAX</b> <b>(NEW)</b> <b>CLIENT-SERVER</b> <b>PROTOCOL</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       If <u>hfaxd</u> is started with the <b>-i</b> option it will service clients using the <u>HylaFAX</u> client-server  protocol.
       This  protocol  is strongly related to the Internet File Transfer Protocol (FTP); so much so in fact that
       FTP client programs that include support for ``quoted commands'' may be used to  communicate  with  <u>hfaxd</u>
       using  the  new  protocol.   (It should also be possible to use FTP-aware World Wide Web browsers such as
       Mosaic and Netscape Navigator to access <u>HylaFAX</u> servers through the new protocol; but the current  format
       for information returned in directory listings confuses them.)

       The  <u>hfaxd</u>  server  currently  recognizes  the  following  protocol  requests; case is not distinguished.
       Entries marked with a ¹ can be used only when the client has established administrative  privileges  with
       ADMIN.

       The following non-standard or experimental commands are supported through the SITE request.

       <b>Request</b>          <b>Description</b>
       ADDMODEM¹        add/configure new modem for use
       ADDUSER¹         add client access control entry
       CONFIG¹          send configuration parameter setting to server
       DELMODEM¹        deconfigure/remove modem
       DELUSER¹         remove client access control entry
       TRIGGER          register realtime event trigger
       HELP             give help information, e.g., SITE HELP

       In  addition  FTP requests that are specified in Internet RFC 959 but not listed here are recognized, but
       not implemented.

       The <u>hfaxd</u> server will abort an active data transfer only when the ABOR command is preceded  by  a  Telnet
       "Interrupt Process" (IP) signal and a Telnet "Synch" signal in the command Telnet stream, as described in
       Internet  RFC  959.   If  a  STAT command is received during a data transfer, preceded by a Telnet IP and
       Synch, transfer status will be returned.

</pre><h4><b>SIMPLE</b> <b>NETWORK</b> <b>PAGING</b> <b>PROTOCOL</b> <b>(SNPP)</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       If <u>hfaxd</u> is started with the <b>-s</b> option it will service clients using the Simple  Network  Pager  Protocol
       (SNPP) as specified in RFC 1861 (which obsoletes RFC 1645).

       The  <u>hfaxd</u> server currently recognizes the SNPP protocol requests listed below.  Requests marked with a ¹
       are non-standard extensions to RFC 1861 that may be added to SNPP at  some  future  time.   Case  is  not
       distinguished and only the first four characters of requests are used in identifying commands.

       <b>Request</b>      <b>Description</b>
       2WAY         preface a 2-way transaction
       ABOR¹        abort previous command
       ACKR         set read acknowledgement handling for subsequent requests
       ALER         set the alter-level for subsequent requests
       CALL         set the caller-ID for subsequent requests
       COVE         set the alternate coverage area for subsequent requests
       DATA         specify a multi-line message
       EXPT         set the expiration time for subsequent requests
       HELP         give help information
       HOLD         set the time at which subsequent requests are to be delivered
       KTAG         kill a previously submitted request
       LEVE         set the service level for subsequent requests
       LOGI         login to server
       MCRE         specify multiple response text and code
       MESS         specify a single-line message
       MSTA         return the status of a previously submitted request
       NOQU         disable message queueing
       PAGE         specify the destination pager
       PING         locate/validate a pager
       QUIT         terminate session
       RESE         reset server state
       RTYP         set the reply type code for subsequent requests
       SEND         send message(s)
       SITE¹        site-specific commands (see next section)
       STAT¹        return server status
       SUBJ         set the message text for subsequent requests

       The  <u>hfaxd</u>  server  will  abort  an  active  SEND  operation when an ABOR command is preceded by a Telnet
       "Interrupt Process" (IP) signal and a Telnet "Synch" signal in the command Telnet stream.

       The following non-standard or experimental commands are also supported through the SITE request.

       <b>Request</b>        <b>Description</b>
       FROMUSER       specify the sender's identity
       IDLE           set idle-timer (in seconds)
       JPARM          query job parameter status
       JQUEUE         control whether or not job is queued
       LASTTIME       set the time to terminate an unfinished job
       MAILADDR       set the e-mail address to use for notification
       MAXDIALS       set the maximum number of times to dial the phone
       MAXTRIES       set the maximum number of times to try sending the page
       MODEM          set the modem or class of modems to use
       NOTIFY         set the e-mail notification
       RETRYTIME      set the time to delay between job retries
       SCHEDPRI       set the scheduling priority for the job
       HELP           give help information, e.g., SITE HELP

       Note that <u>hfaxd</u> requires that SNPP clients login first with the LOGI directive  while  RFC  1861  permits
       clients to submit pages anonymously.

</pre><h4><b>CLIENT</b> <b>ACCESS</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       <u>hfaxd</u> controls client access according to the information in the file <b>/var/spool/hylafax/etc/hosts.hfaxd</b>.
       This  file  defines  the  set  of  users  and  machines that may receive service and, optionally, defines
       password challenges to use in authenticating clients.  Clients may be permitted access to  services  with
       or  without a password challenge.  Access may also be restricted based on the host machine that a request
       for service originates from.  Consult <u><a href="../man5/hosts.hfaxd.5.html">hosts.hfaxd</a></u>(5) for information on the format and  content  of  this
       file.   The SITE ADDUSER protocol request is provided for adding new users to a server (available only to
       clients with administrative privileges).

       Server resources are controlled based on clients' identities.  Jobs  and  documents,  both  received  and
       submitted,  are  protected by the server.  Typically clients are permitted access to anything they own or
       that is publicly accessible.  There are also administrative privileges that clients may acquire and which
       permit them wide access to objects that reside on the server.

       A complete client-server protocol specification is still outstanding.

       <u>hfaxd</u> operates with its root directory set to the top of the <u>HylaFAX</u> spooling  area;  /var/spool/hylafax.
       This is done so that clients see a virtual file hierarchy that is completely contained within the <u>HylaFAX</u>
       operating  environment  on  the server machine.  Administrators however must be aware of this action when
       specifying files in the <u>hfaxd</u> configuration file: absolute pathnames relative to the root of the spooling
       should be used to specify filenames.

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>ACCESS</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       The file <b>/var/spool/hylafax/etc/shutdown</b>, when present, specifies when to restrict  access  to  a  server
       machine.   When  this  file  is  present and contains valid information <u>hfaxd</u> will permit only users with
       administrative privileges to access the server.  Any other users that  request  service  will  be  denied
       access  and  negative  server responses will include any shutdown message specified in the shutdown file.
       Consult <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-shutdown.5.html">hylafax-shutdown</a></u>(5) for information on the format and content of this file.

       The SHUT protocol request can be used to schedule a server shutdown; it is available only to clients with
       administrative privileges.  To make a shutdown server available again the shutdown file  can  be  deleted
       with  the  DELE  protocol  request  (<u>this</u>  <u>is</u>  <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>replaced</u> <u>with</u> <u>an</u> <u>``unshut''</u> <u>protocol</u> <u>request</u> <u>so</u> <u>that</u>
       <u>implementation</u> <u>details</u> <u>are</u> <u>not</u> <u>part</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>protocol</u>).

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>hfaxd</u> reads configuration information from the  file  <b>/etc/hylafax/hfaxd.conf</b>  each  time  a  new  server
       process is started (i.e. for each new client).  This file uses the same conventions used by other <u>HylaFAX</u>
       configuration  files;  as  described  in  <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-config.5.html">hylafax-config</a></u>(5).   The following configuration parameters are
       recognized; items marked ``(SNPP)'' are used only by the SNPP support.

       The configuration parameters are explained below:

       <b>AllowSortFormat</b>
                 This controls whether the server accept the *SORTFMT commands which the client issues to change
                 the server sort the listings.

       <b>FaxContact</b>
                 The e-mail address to display as a point of contact in the help text returned to  a  client  in
                 response  to  the HELP or SITE HELP commands.  By default this is ``FaxMaster@<u>hostname</u>'', where
                 <u>hostname</u> is the fully qualified name for the machine where the server is running.

       <b>FileFmt</b>   The format string to use when  returning  file  status  information  with  the  LIST  and  STAT
                 commands.   Formats  are  specified  using  <u><a href="../man3S/printf.3S.html">printf</a></u>(3S)  style  conventions  but using the field
                 identifiers listed below.  Each item can include field  width,  precision,  left-justification,
                 0-filling,  etc.  just as for <u>printf</u>; e.g. %-8p for an 8-character wide, left-justified, blank-
                 padded field containing the file protection flags.

       <b>IdleTimeout</b>
                 The  initial/default timeout to use in timing out idle clients.  This value defines the maximum
                 amount of time (in seconds) that <u>hfaxd</u> will wait for a command from a client before terminating
                 the connection.   Unprivileged  clients  may  alter  the  idle  timeout  up  to  the  value  of
                 <u>MaxIdleTimeout</u>; privileged clients may set the timeout to any value.

       <b>JobFmt</b>    The  format string to use when returning job status information for jobs in the <b>sendq</b> and <b>doneq</b>
                 directories.  Formats are specified using <u><a href="../man3S/printf.3S.html">printf</a></u>(3S) style  conventions  but  using  the  field
                 identifiers  listed  below.   Each item can include field width, precision, left-justification,

                 The  default  format  string is ``%-4j %3i %1a %6.6o %-12.12e %5P %5D %7z %.25s''.  This string
                 constrains each status line to be less than 80 characters.  It is recommended  that  all  items
                 include  a  field  width so that client applications, such as <u><a href="../man1/faxstat.1.html">faxstat</a></u>(1) that construct headers
                 from the format string can constrain the width of column title strings.

       <b>JobSortFmt</b>
                 The format string to use when sorting the listing for jobs in the sendq and doneq  directories.
                 Follows the JobFmt formatting rules.

       <b>JobProtection</b>
                 The  file  mode  setting  for  job qfiles in the <u>HylaFAX</u> queues (sendq and doneq).  The default
                 setting of ``0644'' allows all users to view all job parameters in the  send/done  queues.   If
                 <u>PublicJobQ</u>  is  set  to false, then this file mode determines the permissions of the clients to
                 see the jobs, following the  <u>HylaFAX</u>  permission  model  of  the  group  bits  controlling  uid
                 permissions and the other bits controlling other permissions.

       <b>KillTimeMap</b>
                 The  mapping  from  SNPP service level (0-11) to job expiration time (kill time).  A mapping is
                 specified as a string of space-separate numbers where each value is the number  of  minutes  to
                 permit  a  job to run.  The default mapping is ``5 5 5 15 60 240 720 1440 1440 1440 1440 1440''
                 which expires a job in 5 minutes for service levels 0-2, 15 minutes for level three, 60 minutes
                 for level four, etc.

       <b>LogFacility</b>
                 The symbolic  name  for  the  <u><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></u>(3)  facility  to  use  when  logging  error  messages  and
                 informational/debugging  messages  requested  through the <b>ServerTracing</b> parameter.  The list of
                 facility names  is  found  in  the  system  include  file  <b>&lt;syslog.h&gt;</b>;  comparisons  are  case-
                 insensitive.

       <b>MaxAdminAttempts</b>
                 The  maximum  number  of  unsuccessful  attempts  gain administrative privileges with the ADMIN
                 command that <u>hfaxd</u> will permit a client before terminating the connection.  Note that the count
                 of attempts is reset if/when the client successfully gains administrative privileges.

       <b>MaxConsecutiveBadCmds</b>
                 The maximum number of consecutive  unrecognized,  unimplemented,  syntactically  incorrect,  or
                 otherwise  unacceptable  commands  to  permit a client before terminating the connection.  This
                 control has two purposes: to handle naive or malicious clients from  sending  long  streams  of
                 nonsense commands to a server, and to insure that clients are forcibly terminated when a server
                 is marked shutdown.

       <b>MaxIdleTimeout</b>
                 The maximum value that a client may set the idle timeout to.  This value is not enforced if the
                 client has administrative privileges.

       <b>MaxLoginAttempts</b>
                 The maximum number of unsuccessful attempts to login with the USER and PASS commands that <u>hfaxd</u>
                 will permit a client before terminating the connection.

       <b>MaxMsgLength</b>
                 The  maximum  number of characters to accept in a pager message specified with the DATA or MESS
                 commands.  Messages longer than this value are rejected.

       <b>ModemFmt</b>  The format string to use when returning modem status  information  for  modems  listed  in  the
                 <b>status</b> directory.  Formats are specified using <u><a href="../man3S/printf.3S.html">printf</a></u>(3S) style conventions but using the field
                 identifiers  listed  below.   Each item can include field width, precision, left-justification,
                 0-filling, etc. just as for <u>printf</u>; e.g. %-8h for an 8-character wide,  left-justified,  blank-
                 padded field containing the name of the host the server is running on.

                 <b>Format</b>    <b>Description</b>

                 The default format string is ``Modem %m (%n): %s''.

       <b>ModemSortFmt</b>
                 The  format  string to use when sorting the listsin for  modem status information in the status
                 directory.

       <b>PagerIDMapFile</b>
                 The absolute pathname of the file that contains directions for  mapping  pager  identifiers  to
                 IXO/TAP  or  UCP  service  providers  (and  optionally a pager identification number).  Consult
                 <u><a href="../man5/pagermap.5.html">pagermap</a></u>(5) for information on the format and  content  of  this  file.   (Note  that  absolute
                 pathnames are relative to the root of the spooling area).

       <b>PriorityMap</b>
                 The  mapping from SNPP service level (0-11) to job scheduling priority.  A mapping is specified
                 as a string of space-separate numbers where each value is the priority to assign to a job.  The
                 default mapping is ``63 127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127  127''  which  assigns  a  high
                 priority to service level zero and normal (default) priority to all other service levels.

       <b>PublicJobQ</b>
                 By  default,  HylaFAX  has  always made the listings of the sendq/doneq include all jobs to any
                 client connected to hfaxd.  By setting this to false,  hfaxd  will  also  enforce  it's  normal
                 access  restrictions  on the listing of jobs in the sendq/doneq.  These access restrictions are
                 based on the file mode (see <u>JobProtection</u> ) and the logged in uid (see <u>hosts.hfaxd</u> )

       <b>PublicRecvQ</b>
                 By default, HylaFAX has always made the listings of the recvq include all faxes to  any  client
                 connected  to  hfaxd.   By  setting  this  to false, hfaxd will also enforce it's normal access
                 restrictions on the listing of faxes in the recvq.  These access restrictions are based on  the
                 file  mode <u>faxgetty</u> (and it's related <u>FaxDispatch</u> ) set for the fax, and the logged in uid (see
                 <u>hosts.hfaxd</u> )

       <b>RcvFmt</b>    The format string to use when returning status information for received facsimile in the  <b>recvq</b>
                 directory.   Formats  are  specified  using  <u><a href="../man3S/printf.3S.html">printf</a></u>(3S)  style  conventions but using the field
                 identifiers listed below.  Each item can include field  width,  precision,  left-justification,

                 z         A ``*'' if receive is going on; otherwise `` '' (space)

                 The default format string is ``%-7m %4p%1z %-8.8o %14.14s %7t  %f''.   This  string  constrains
                 each  status  line  to  be less than 80 characters.  It is recommended that all items include a
                 field width so that client applications, such as <u><a href="../man1/faxstat.1.html">faxstat</a></u>(1) that  construct  headers  from  the

       <b>RcvSortFmt</b>
                 The  format  string  to  use  when  sorting  the  listing  for  received facsimile in the recvq
                 directory.  Follows the RcvFmt formatting rules.

       <b>RetryTimeMap</b>
                 The mapping from SNPP service level (0-11) to job retry time.  A  mapping  is  specified  as  a
                 string  of  space-separate  numbers  where each value is the number of seconds to delay between
                 delivery attempts.  A value of zero causes retries to be scheduled using the default  algorithm
                 used  by  the  <u>HylaFAX</u>  job scheduler.  The default mapping is ``30 60 60 180 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0''
                 which retries a level 0 job after a 30 second delay, levels 1 and 2 after 60 seconds,  level  3
                 after 3 minutes, and other jobs are retried according to the usual scheduling algorithm.

       <b>ServerTracing</b>
                 A  number  that  controls  the  generation  of tracing information by a server.  <u>areas</u> that are
                 individually controlled.  To enable tracing of multiple areas of operation, the flag associated
                 with each area should be bit-or'd to form the value for this tag.

                 The  absolute  pathname  of the user access control file; see <u><a href="../man5/hosts.hfaxd.5.html">hosts.hfaxd</a></u>(5) for information on
                 the format and content of this file.  (Note that absolute pathnames are relative to the root of
                 the spooling area).

       <b>XferLogFile</b>
                 The absolute pathname of the file to use for logging client-server file transfers (when enabled
                 through the <b>ServerTracing</b> parameter).  (Note that absolute pathnames are relative to  the  root
                 of the spooling area).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-q</b> <u>dir</u>    The  specified  directory  is  treated  as  the  spooling  area.   The  default  spooling area,
                 <u>/var/spool/hylafax</u>, is defined at the time the software is built.

       <b>-d</b>        Stop <u>hfaxd</u> from <u>detaching</u> itself from the controlling terminal.  This option is  normally  used
                 only when running <u>hfaxd</u> under a debugger or when <u>hfaxd</u> is started up from the <u><a href="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd</a></u>(8) process.

       <b>-l</b> <u>bindaddress</u>
                 Bind  to  the  specified  <u>bindaddress</u>  the  tcp port. Please note that this argument need to be
                 specified before the <b>-i</b> otherwise it will be ignored. A better  approach  to  improve  security
                 would  be  to  run  hfaxd from xinetd, binding its service to the specific port. This will also
                 make hylafax benefits from tcp wrappers and other options provided by xinetd.

       <b>-i</b> <u>port</u>   Listen on the specified <u>port</u> for service requests and respond with the client-server  protocol.
                 The  port may be specified either symbolically, e.g. ``hylafax'' or numerically.  This flag may
                 be specified multiple times to request service on multiple different  ports.   Each  time  this
                 flag  is  specified,  it  will  listen  on the specified port, bound to the last <b>-l</b> <u>bindaddress</u>
                 specified.  If no <b>-l</b> <u>bindaddress</u> was specified, it will bind to the system  configured  default
                 wildcard address, which could be any of IPv6, or IPv4, or both.

       <b>-s</b> <u>port</u>   Listen  on  the  specified <u>port</u> for service requests and respond with the Simple Network Paging
                 (SNPP) protocol.  The port may be specified either symbolically, e.g. ``snpp'' or  numerically.
                 This flag may be specified multiple times to request service on multiple different ports.

       <b>-I</b>        Service  the client-server protocol using the standard input and output.  This option is useful
                 when <u>hfaxd</u> is started up by <u><a href="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd</a></u>(8).

       <b>-S</b>        Service the Simple Network Paging (SNPP) protocol using the standard input  and  output.   This
                 option is useful when <u>hfaxd</u> is started up by <u><a href="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd</a></u>(8).

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Diagnostics generated by <u>hfaxd</u> are logged using <u><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></u>(3).
