       bootpd, bootpgw - Internet Boot Protocol server/gateway

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bootpd</b> [ <b>-v</b> ] [ <b>-i</b> <b>-s</b> <b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u> <b>-d</b> <u>level</u> <b>-c</b> <u>chdir-path</u> ] [ <u>bootptab</u> [ <u>dumpfile</u> ] ]
       <b>bootpgw</b> [ <b>-v</b> ] [ <b>-i</b> <b>-s</b> <b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u> <b>-d</b> <u>level</u> ] <u>server</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Bootpd</b>  implements  an  Internet  Bootstrap  Protocol  (BOOTP)  server as defined in RFC951, RFC1532, and
       RFC1533. This  server  also  provides  some  extension  to  support  the  static  part  of  Dynamic  Host
       Configuration  Protocol  (DHCP)  as  specified  in  RFC1533.  DHCP is used by Windows NT and 95.  <b>Bootpgw</b>
       implements a simple BOOTP gateway which can be used to forward requests and responses between clients  on
       one  subnet  and  a  BOOTP  server  (i.e.  <b>bootpd</b>) on another subnet. While either <b>bootpd</b> or <b>bootpgw</b> will
       forward BOOTREPLY packets, only <b>bootpgw</b> will forward BOOTREQUEST packets.

       One host on each network segment is normally configured to run either <b>bootpd</b> or  <b>bootpgw</b>  from  <b>inetd</b>  by
       including one of the following lines in the file <u>/etc/inetd.conf</u>:

              bootps dgram udp wait root /usr/sbin/bootpd bootpd bootptab
              bootps dgram udp wait root /usr/sbin/bootpgw bootpgw server

       This  mode  of operation is referred to as "inetd mode" and causes <b>bootpd</b> (or <b>bootpgw</b>) to be started only
       when a boot request arrives.  If it does not receive another packet within fifteen minutes  of  the  last
       one  it  received,  it  will exit to conserve system resources.  The <b>-t</b> option controls this timeout (see
       OPTIONS below).

       It is also possible to run <b>bootpd</b> (or <b>bootpgw</b>) in "standalone mode" (without <b>inetd</b>) by simply invoking it
       from a shell like any other regular command.  Standalone mode is particularly useful when <b>bootpd</b> is  used
       with  a large configuration database, where the start up delay might otherwise prevent timely response to
       client requests.  (Automatic start up in standalone mode can be  done  by  invoking  <b>bootpd</b>  from  within
       <u>/etc/rc.local</u>,  for  example.)   Standalone mode is less useful for <b>bootgw</b> which has very little start up
       delay because it does not read a configuration file.

       Either program automatically detects whether it was invoked from inetd or from a shell and  automatically
       selects  the  appropriate  mode.   The  <b>-s</b>  or  <b>-i</b>  option  may be used to force standalone or inetd mode
       respectively (see OPTIONS).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u>
              Specifies the <u>timeout</u> value (in minutes) that a <b>bootpd</b> or <b>bootpgw</b> process will wait  for  a  BOOTP
              packet  before  exiting.   If  no  packets are received for <u>timeout</u> seconds, then the program will
              exit.  A timeout value of zero means "run forever".  In standalone mode, this option is forced  to
              zero.

       <b>-d</b> <u>debug-level</u>
              Sets  the  <u>debug-level</u>  variable  that  controls  the amount of debugging messages generated.  For
              example, -d4 or -d 4 will set the debugging level to 4.  For compatibility with older versions  of
              <b>bootpd</b>,  omitting  the  numeric  parameter (i.e. just -d) will simply increment the debug level by
              one.

       <b>-c</b> <u>chdir-path</u>
              Sets the current directory used by <b>bootpd</b> while checking the existence and  size  of  client  boot
              files.   This  is  useful  when  client boot files are specified as relative pathnames, and <b>bootpd</b>
              needs to use the same current directory as the TFTP server (typically <u>/tftpboot</u>).  This option  is
              not recognized by <b>bootpgw</b>.

       <b>-i</b>     Force  inetd  mode.  This option is obsolete, but remains for compatibility with older versions of
              <b>bootpd</b>.

       <b>-s</b>     Force standalone mode.  This option is obsolete, but remains for compatibility with older versions
              of <b>bootpd</b>.

       <b>-v</b>     Print version and exit.

       <u>bootptab</u>
              Specifies the name of the configuration file from which <u>bootpd</u> loads its database of known clients
              and client options (<b>bootpd</b> only). Default is <u>/etc/bootptab</u>.

       <u>dumpfile</u>
              Specifies the name of the file that <b>bootpd</b> will dump its internal database into when it receives a
              <b>SIGUSR1</b> signal (<b>bootpd</b> only).  This option is only recognized if  <b>bootpd</b>  was  compiled  with  the
              -DDEBUG flag.

       <u>server</u> Specifies  the  name  of  a  BOOTP server to which <b>bootpgw</b> will forward all BOOTREQUEST packets it
              receives (<b>bootpgw</b> only).

</pre><h4><b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       Both <b>bootpd</b> and <b>bootpgw</b> operate similarly in that both listen for any packets sent to  the  <b>bootps</b>  port,
       and both simply forward any BOOTREPLY packets.  They differ in their handling of BOOTREQUEST packets.

       When  <b>bootpgw</b> is started, it determines the address of a BOOTP server whose name is provided as a command
       line parameter.  When <b>bootpgw</b> receives a BOOTREQUEST packet, it  sets  the  "gateway  address"  and  "hop
       count"  fields  in  the  packet  and  forwards  the  packet to the BOOTP server at the address determined
       earlier.  Requests are forwarded only if they indicate that the client has  been  waiting  for  at  least
       three seconds.

       When  <b>bootpd</b>  is  started  it  reads  a configuration file, (normally <u>/etc/bootptab</u>) that initializes the
       internal database of known clients and client options.  This  internal  database  is  reloaded  from  the
       configuration  file  when  <b>bootpd</b>  receives  a  hangup  signal  (SIGHUP)  or  when  it discovers that the
       configuration file has changed.  Note that any changes to the configuration  file  should  be  atomic  to
       avoid race conditions.

       When <b>bootpd</b> receives a BOOTREQUEST packet, it looks for a database entry matching the client request.  If
       the  client  is known, <b>bootpd</b> composes a BOOTREPLY packet using the database entry found above, and sends
       the reply to the client (possibly using a gateway).  If the client is unknown, the request  is  discarded
       (with a notice if debug &gt; 0).

       If <b>bootpd</b> is compiled with the -DDEBUG option, receipt of a <b>SIGUSR1</b> signal causes it to dump its internal
       database to the file <u>/tmp/bootpd.dump</u> or the dumpfile specified as a command line parameter.

       During   initialization,   both   programs  determine  the  UDP  port  numbers  to  be  used  by  calling
       <b><a href="../man3/getservbyname.3.html">getservbyname</a></b>(3) (which normally uses <u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u>).  Two service names (and port numbers) are used:

              bootps - BOOTP Server listening port
              bootpc - BOOTP Client destination port

       If the port numbers cannot be determined using <u>getservbyname</u> then the values  default  to  boopts=67  and
       bootpc=68.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/bootptab</u>
              Database file read by <b>bootpd</b>.

       <u>/tmp/bootpd.dump</u>
              Debugging dump file created by <b>bootpd</b>.

       <u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u>
              Internet service numbers.

       <u>/tftpboot</u>
              Current directory typically used by the TFTP server and <b>bootpd</b>.

       The original BOOTP server was created by Bill Croft at Stanford University in January 1986.

       The current version of <b>bootpd</b> is primarily the work of David Kovar, Drew D. Perkins, and Walter L. Wimer,
       at Carnegie Mellon University.
