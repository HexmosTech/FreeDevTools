</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       popa3d - Post Office Protocol (POP3) server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>popa3d</b> [<b>-D</b>] [<b>-V</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>popa3d</b> is a Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) server.

       A  POP3  server operates on local mailboxes on behalf of its remote users.  Users can connect at any time
       to check their mailbox and fetch the mail that has accumulated.  The advantage of this "pull" approach is
       that any user with a simple POP3-capable mail reader program can receive mail, eschewing the need  for  a
       full-fledged Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) and a permanent network connection.

       Note  that  POP3  can  only be used to retrieve mail, not to send it.  To send mail, the SMTP protocol is
       commonly used.

       For access to a mailbox through POP3, the username must  be  in  the  password  database.   Additionally,
       <b>popa3d</b> does not permit null passwords and will refuse to serve mail for root (UID 0) users.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-D</b>     Standalone  server  mode.  In this mode, <b>popa3d</b> will become a daemon, accepting connections on the
              pop3 port (110/tcp) and forking child processes to handle them.   This  has  lower  overhead  than
              starting  <b>popa3d</b>  from an inetd equivalent (which <b>popa3d</b> assumes by default) and is thus useful on
              busy servers to reduce load.  In this mode <b>popa3d</b> also does quite a few  checks  to  significantly
              reduce the impact of connection flood attacks.

       <b>-V</b>     Print version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       A normal POP3 session progresses through three states: AUTHORIZATION, TRANSACTION, and UPDATE.

       After  the  TCP  connection  opens,  the  client  must  authenticate  itself  to  the  server  during the
       AUTHORIZATION state.  The following commands are supported in the AUTHORIZATION state (all command  names
       are case-insensitive).

       <b>USER</b> <u>name</u>
              Authenticate as user <u>name</u>.

       <b>PASS</b> <u>string</u>
              Authenticate using password <u>string</u>.

       <b>QUIT</b>   Quit; do not enter UPDATE state.

       When  authorization  is successful, the server enters the TRANSACTION state.  The client can now list and
       retrieve messages or mark messages for deletion.  The following commands are supported in the TRANSACTION
       state.

       <b>DELE</b> <u>msg</u>
              Mark message for deletion.

       <b>LAST</b>   Show highest message number accessed (obsolete).

       <b>LIST</b> [<u>msg</u>]
              List message number and size.

       <b>NOOP</b>   Do nothing.

       <b>QUIT</b>   Quit; enter UPDATE state.

       <b>RETR</b> <u>msg</u>
              Retrieve message.

       <b>RSET</b>   Clear deletion marks.

       <b>STAT</b>   Return total number of messages and total size.

       <b>TOP</b> <u>msg</u> <u>n</u>
              Show top <u>n</u> lines of message body.

       <b>UIDL</b> [<u>msg</u>]
              List message number and digest.

       When the client issues the <b>QUIT</b> command in the TRANSACTION state, the server  enters  the  UPDATE  state.
       All messages that were marked for deletion are now removed.  The server then closes the connection.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       POP3  transmits  passwords  in plaintext and thus, if you care about the security of your individual user
       accounts, should only be used either in trusted networks or tunneled over encrypted channels.

       There exist extensions to the protocol that are supposed to fix this problem.  <b>popa3d</b>  does  not  support
       them yet, partly because this isn't going to fully fix the problem.  In fact, APOP and the weaker defined
       SASL  mechanisms  such  as  CRAM-MD5  may  potentially be even less secure than transmission of plaintext
       passwords because of the requirement that plaintext equivalents be stored on the server.
