</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rlogind — remote login server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rlogind</b> [<b>-afhlLn</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Rlogind</b>  is  the  server  for  the  <u><a href="../man1/rlogin.1.html">rlogin</a></u>(1)  program.  The server provides a remote login facility with
       authentication based on privileged port numbers from trusted hosts.

       Options supported by <b>rlogind</b>:

       <b>-a</b>      This option exists for compatibility with historical systems.

       <b>-f</b>      Disable the Nagle algorithm.  This is only needed to work around some broken operating systems.

       <b>-h</b>      Permit use of superuser “<u>.rhosts</u>” files.

       <b>-l</b>      Prevent any authentication based on the user's “<u>.rhosts</u>” file. If the user is logging in  as  the
               superuser and the -h option is used, “<u>.rhosts</u>” processing is still enabled.

       <b>-L</b>      Prevent any authentication based on “<u>.rhosts</u>” or “<u>hosts.equiv</u>” information.

       <b>-n</b>      Disable keep-alive messages.

       The -h, -l, and -L flags are not used if PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) support is in use.

       The  <b>-h</b>  and  <b>-l</b> options should also not be trusted without verifying that they work as expected with the
       particular version of libc installed on your system (and should be tested again after  any  libc  update)
       because  some  versions  of  libc  may  not  honor  the internal flags used by <b>rlogind</b>.  As the <b>-L</b> option
       bypasses the libc functions entirely, it is not subject to this problem.

       Also note that the design of the <u>.rhosts</u> system is COMPLETELY INSECURE except on a  carefully  firewalled
       private  network.  Always  use  the <b>-L</b> option under all other circumstances. Also, since <b>rlogind</b> does not
       encrypt communications, it should not, in general, be used at all. Consider <u><a href="../man8/ssh.8.html">ssh</a></u>(8).

       <b>Rlogind</b> listens for service requests at the port indicated in the ``login''  service  specification;  see
       <u><a href="../man5/services.5.html">services</a></u>(5).  When a service request is received the following protocol is initiated:

       1.   The  server  checks  the client's source port.  If the port is not in the range 512-1023, the server
            aborts the connection.

       2.   The server checks the client's  source  address  and  requests  the  corresponding  host  name  (see
            <u><a href="../man3/gethostbyaddr.3.html">gethostbyaddr</a></u>(3),  <u><a href="../man5/hosts.5.html">hosts</a></u>(5)  and  <u><a href="../man8/named.8.html">named</a></u>(8)).  If the hostname cannot be determined, the dot-notation
            representation of the host address is used.  The addresses for the hostname are requested, verifying
            that the name and address correspond.  Normal authentication is bypassed if the address verification
            fails.

       Once the source port and address have been checked, <b>rlogind</b>  proceeds  with  the  authentication  process
       described in <u><a href="../man8/rshd.8.html">rshd</a></u>(8).  It then allocates a pseudo terminal (see <u><a href="../man4/pty.4.html">pty</a></u>(4)), and manipulates file descriptors
       so  that the slave half of the pseudo terminal becomes the <u>stdin</u>, <u>stdout</u>, and <u>stderr</u> for a login process.
       The login process is an instance of the <u><a href="../man1/login.1.html">login</a></u>(1) program, invoked with the <b>-f</b>  option  if  authentication
       has  succeeded.   If  automatic  authentication fails, the user is prompted to log in as if on a standard
       terminal line.

       The parent of the login process manipulates the master side of  the  pseudo  terminal,  operating  as  an
       intermediary  between  the  login  process  and  the  client  instance  of the <u>rlogin</u> program.  In normal
       operation, the packet protocol described in <u><a href="../man4/pty.4.html">pty</a></u>(4) is invoked to  provide  ‘^S/^Q’  type  facilities  and
       propagate  interrupt  signals to the remote programs.  The login process propagates the client terminal's
       baud rate and terminal type, as found in the environment variable, ‘TERM’; see <u><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></u>(7).  The screen or
       window size of the terminal is requested from the client, and window size changes  from  the  client  are
       propagated to the pseudo terminal.

       Transport-level  keepalive  messages  are  enabled unless the <b>-n</b> option is present.  The use of keepalive
       messages allows sessions to be timed out if the client crashes or becomes unreachable.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       All initial diagnostic messages are indicated by a leading byte with  a  value  of  1,  after  which  any
       network  connections are closed.  If there are no errors before <u>login</u> is invoked, a null byte is returned
       as in indication of success.

       <b>Try</b> <b>again.</b>
               A <u>fork</u> by the server failed.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The authentication procedure used here assumes the integrity of each client machine  and  the  connecting
       medium.  This is insecure, but is useful in an ``open'' environment.

       A facility to allow all data exchanges to be encrypted should be present.

       A more extensible protocol should be used.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>rlogind</b> command appeared in 4.2BSD.
