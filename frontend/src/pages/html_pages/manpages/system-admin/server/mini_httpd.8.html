</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>mini_httpd</u>  is  a  small  HTTP server.  Its performance is not great, but for low or medium traffic sites
       it's quite adequate.  It implements all the basic features of an HTTP server, including:

       *  GET, HEAD, and POST methods.

       *  CGI.

       *  Basic authentication.

       *  Security against ".." filename snooping.

       *  The common MIME types.

       *  Trailing-slash redirection.

       *  index.html, index.htm, index.cgi

       *  Directory listings.

       *  Multihoming / virtual hosting.

       *  Standard logging.

       *  Custom error pages.

       mini_httpd can be automatically started in two ways.  The included systemd service is used to control the
       server in systemd environments. This is inherently more secure as the  service  makes  use  of  hardening
       features.  The included init.d script starts the server in non-systemd environments still using classical
       SysV style init.

       It can also be configured to do SSL/HTTPS.

       mini_httpd was written for a couple reasons.  One, as an experiment to see just how slow an old-fashioned
       forking web server would be with today's operating systems.  The answer is, surprisingly, not that slow -
       on  FreeBSD  3.2,  mini_httpd  benchmarks  at  about  90% the speed of Apache.  The other main reason for
       writing mini_httpd was to get a simple platform for experimenting with new  web  server  technology,  for
       instance SSL.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-C</b>     Specifies  a  config-file  to read.  All options can be set either by command-line flags or in the
              config file.  See below for details.

       <b>-p</b>     Specifies an alternate port number to listen on.  The default is 80.  The config-file option  name
              for this flag is "port".

       <b>-d</b>     Specifies  a directory to chdir() to at startup.  This is merely a convenience - you could just as
              easily do a cd in the shell script that invokes the program.  The config-file option name for this
              flag is "dir".

       <b>-dd</b>    Specifies a directory to chdir() to after chrooting.  If you're not chrooting, you might  as  well
              do  a single chdir() with the -d flag.  If you are chrooting, this lets you put the web files in a
              subdirectory of the chroot tree, instead of in the top level mixed in with the chroot files.   The
              config-file option name for this flag is "data_dir".

       <b>-c</b>     Specifies  a wildcard pattern for CGI programs, for instance "**.cgi" or "cgi-bin/*".  The default
              is no CGI.  The config-file option name for this flag is "cgipat".

       <b>-u</b>     Specifies what user to switch to after initialization  when  started  as  root.   The  default  is
              "nobody".  The config-file option name for this flag is "user".

       <b>-h</b>     Specifies  a  hostname  to  bind  to,  for  multihoming.   The default is to bind to all hostnames
              supported on the local machine.  The config-file option name for this flag is "host".

       <b>-r</b>     Do a chroot() at initialization time, restricting file access to the program's current  directory.
              See below for details.  The config-file option names for this flag are "chroot" and "nochroot".

       <b>-v</b>     Do virtual hosting.  See below for details.  The config-file option name for this flag is "vhost".

       <b>-l</b>     Specifies  a log file name.  The default is no logging.  The config-file option name for this flag
              is "logfile".

       <b>-i</b>     Specifies a file to write the process-id to.  If no file is specified, no process-id  is  written.
              You can use this file to send signals to mini_httpd.  The config-file option name for this flag is
              "pidfile".

       <b>-T</b>     Specifies the character set to use with text MIME types.  The default is "UTF-8".  The config-file
              option name for this flag is "charset".

       <b>-P</b>     Specifies   a   P3P   server   privacy   header   to   be   returned   with  all  responses.   See
              <a href="http://www.w3.org/P3P/">http://www.w3.org/P3P/</a> for details.  Mini_httpd doesn't do anything at all with the string  except
              put it in the P3P: response header.  The config-file option name for this flag is "p3p".

       <b>-M</b>     Specifies  the  number  of  seconds to be used in a "Cache-Control: max-age" header to be returned
              with all responses.  An equivalent "Expires" header is also generated.  The default is  no  Cache-
              Control  or  Expires  headers, which is just fine for most sites.  The config-file option name for
              this flag is "max_age".

       <b>-S</b>     If mini_httpd is configured to do SSL/HTTPS, then the -S flag is available to enable this feature.
              The config-file option name for this flag is "ssl".

       <b>-E</b>     If mini_httpd is configured to do SSL/HTTPS, then you can specify a server certificate  with  this
              flag.   You  can make a certificate with the command "make cert".  The default is "mini_httpd.pem"
              (in the directory where you start mini_httpd).  The config-file  option  name  for  this  flag  is
              "certfile".

       <b>-Y</b>     If  mini_httpd  is  configured  to do SSL/HTTPS, then you can specify a cipher set with this flag.
              Examples of cipher sets: "RC4-MD5", "DES-CBC3-SHA", "AES256-SHA".  The  default  is  to  let  each
              browser  negotiate ciphers separately, and unless you know what you're doing it's best to let them
              do so.  The config-file option name for this flag is "cipher".

       <b>-D</b>     This was originally just a debugging flag, however it's worth mentioning because one of the things
              it does is prevent mini_httpd from making itself a background daemon.   Instead  it  runs  in  the
              foreground like a regular program.  This is necessary when you want to run mini_httpd wrapped in a
              little  shell  script  that restarts it if it exits.  The config-file option name for this flag is
              "debug".

       <b>-V</b>     Shows mini_httpd's version and then exits.

</pre><h4><b>CGI</b></h4><pre>
       mini_httpd supports the CGI 1.1 spec.

       In order for a CGI program to be run, its name must match the pattern you specify with the -c  flag  This
       is a simple shell-style filename pattern.  You can use * to match any string not including a slash, or **
       to  match  any  string  including slashes, or ? to match any single character.  You can also use multiple
       such patterns separated by |.  The patterns get checked against the filename part of  the  incoming  URL.
       Don't forget to quote any wildcard characters so that the shell doesn't mess with them.

</pre><h4><b>BASIC</b> <b>AUTHENTICATION</b></h4><pre>
       Basic  Authentication  uses  a  password file called ".htpasswd", in the directory to be protected.  This
       file is formatted as the familiar colon-separated username/encrypted-password pair, records delimited  by
       newlines.   The  protection  does  not  carry over to subdirectories.  The utility program <a href="../man1/htpasswd.1.html">htpasswd</a>(1) is
       included to help create and modify .htpasswd files.

</pre><h4><b>CHROOT</b></h4><pre>
       chroot() is a system call that restricts the program's view of the filesystem to  the  current  directory
       and  directories  below  it.   It  becomes  impossible for remote users to access any file outside of the
       initial directory.  The restriction is inherited by child processes, so CGI programs get it too.  This is
       a very strong security measure, and is recommended.  The  only  downside  is  that  only  root  can  call
       chroot(),  so  this  means  the  program must be started as root.  However, the last thing it does during
       initialization is to give up root access by becoming another user, so this is safe.

       Note that with some other web servers, such as NCSA httpd, setting up  a  directory  tree  for  use  with
       chroot()  is complicated, involving creating a bunch of special directories and copying in various files.
       With mini_httpd it's a lot easier, all you have to do is make sure  any  shells,  utilities,  and  config
       files  used  by  your CGI programs and scripts are available.  If you have CGI disabled, or if you make a
       policy that all CGI programs must be written in a compiled language such as C and statically linked, then
       you probably don't have to do any setup at all.

       However, one thing you should do is tell syslogd about the chroot tree,  so  that  mini_httpd  can  still
       generate syslog messages.  Check your system's syslodg man page for how to do this.  In FreeBSD you would
       put something like this in /etc/rc.conf:
           syslogd_flags="-l /usr/local/www/data/dev/log"
       Substitute  in  your  own  chroot tree's pathname, of course.  Don't worry about creating the log socket,
       syslogd wants to do that itself.  (You may need to create the dev directory.)  In Linux the  flag  is  -a
       instead of -l, and there may be other differences.

</pre><h4><b>MULTIHOMING</b></h4><pre>
       Multihoming  means  using  one  machine to serve multiple hostnames.  For instance, if you're an internet
       provider and you want to let all of  your  customers  have  customized  web  addresses,  you  might  have
       www.joe.acme.com,  www.jane.acme.com,  and  your  own  www.acme.com,  all  running  on  the same physical
       hardware.  This feature is also known as "virtual hosts".  There are three steps to setting this up.

       One, make DNS entries for all of the hostnames.  The current way to do this, allowed by HTTP/1.1,  is  to
       use CNAME aliases, like so:
         www.acme.com IN A 192.100.66.1
         www.joe.acme.com IN CNAME www.acme.com
         www.jane.acme.com IN CNAME www.acme.com
       However,  this  is  incompatible with older HTTP/1.0 browsers.  If you want to stay compatible, there's a
       different way - use A records instead, each with a different IP address, like so:
         www.acme.com IN A 192.100.66.1
         www.joe.acme.com IN A 192.100.66.200
         www.jane.acme.com IN A 192.100.66.201
       This is bad because it uses extra IP addresses, a somewhat scarce resource.  But if you want people  with
       older browsers to be able to visit your sites, you still have to do it this way.

       Step  two.   If  you're  using  the  modern  CNAME  method  of  multihoming, then you can skip this step.
       Otherwise, using the older multiple-IP-address method you must set up IP aliases or  multiple  interfaces
       for the extra addresses.  You can use <a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a>(8)'s alias command to tell the machine to answer to all of
       the different IP addresses.  Example:
         ifconfig le0 www.acme.com
         ifconfig le0 www.joe.acme.com alias
         ifconfig le0 www.jane.acme.com alias
       If your OS's version of ifconfig doesn't have an alias command, you're probably out of luck.

       Third  and last, you must set up mini_httpd to handle the multiple hosts.  The easiest way is with the -v
       flag.  This works with either CNAME multihosting or multiple-IP multihosting.  What it does is send  each
       incoming  request to a subdirectory based on the hostname it's intended for.  All you have to do in order
       to set things up is to create those subdirectories in the directory where mini_httpd will run.  With  the
       example above, you'd do like so:
         mkdir www.acme.com www.joe.acme.com www.jane.acme.com
       If  you're  using  old-style  multiple-IP  multihosting,  you  should also create symbolic links from the
       numeric addresses to the names, like so:
         ln -s www.acme.com 192.100.66.1
         ln -s www.joe.acme.com 192.100.66.200
         ln -s www.jane.acme.com 192.100.66.201
       This lets the older HTTP/1.0 browsers find the right subdirectory.

       There's an optional alternate step three  if  you're  using  multiple-IP  multihosting:  run  a  separate
       mini_httpd  process  for  each hostname, using the -h flag to specify which one is which.  This gives you
       more flexibility, since you can run each of these processes in separate  directories  or  with  different
       options.  Example:
         ( cd /usr/www ; mini_httpd -h www.acme.com )
         ( cd /usr/www/joe ; mini_httpd -u joe -h www.joe.acme.com )
         ( cd /usr/www/jane ; mini_httpd -u jane -h www.jane.acme.com )
       But remember, this multiple-process method does not work with CNAME multihosting ‐ for that, you must use
       a single mini_httpd process with the -v flag.

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOM</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       mini_httpd  lets  you define your own custom error pages for the various HTTP errors.  There's a separate
       file for each error number, all stored in one special directory.  The directory name is "errors", at  the
       top  of  the  web  directory tree.  The error files should be named "errNNN.html", where NNN is the error
       number.  So for example, to make a custom error page for  the  authentication  failure  error,  which  is
       number 401, you would put your HTML into the file "errors/err401.html".  If no custom error file is found
       for a given error number, then the usual built-in error page is generated.

       If  you're  using  the  virtual  hosts  option,  you  can also have different custom error pages for each
       different virtual host.  In this case you put another "errors" directory  in  the  top  of  that  virtual
       host's  web  tree.   mini_httpd  will  look  first  in the virtual host errors directory, and then in the
       server-wide errors directory, and if neither of those has an appropriate error file then it will generate
       the built-in error.

</pre><h4><b>NON-LOCAL</b> <b>REFERRERS</b></h4><pre>
       Sometimes another site on the net will embed your image files in their HTML files, which basically  means
       they're  stealing  your  bandwidth.   You  can  prevent  them from doing this by using non-local referrer
       filtering.  With this option, certain files can only be fetched via a local referrer.  The files have  to
       be  referenced  by  a  local web page.  If a web page on some other site references the files, that fetch
       will be blocked.  There are three config-file variables for this feature:

       <b>urlpat</b> A wildcard pattern for the URLs that should require a local  referrer.   This  is  typically  just
              image files, sound files, and so on.  For example:
                urlpat=**.jpg|**.gif|**.au|**.wav
              For most sites, that one setting is all you need to enable referrer filtering.

       <b>noemptyreferrers</b>
              By  default,  requests with no referrer at all, or a null referrer, or a referrer with no apparent
              hostname, are allowed.  With this variable set, such requests are disallowed.

       <b>localpat</b>
              A wildcard pattern that specifies the local host or hosts.  This is used to determine if the  host
              in the referrer is local or not.  If not specified it defaults to the actual local hostname.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       mini_httpd  will  terminate cleanly upon receipt of a number of different signals, which you can send via
       the standard Unix <a href="../man1/kill.1.html">kill</a>(1) command.  Any of SIGTERM, SIGINT, or SIGUSR1 will do the trick.   All  requests
       in  progress  will  be  completed.   The  network  socket  used  to  accept  new  connections gets closed
       immediately, which means a fresh mini_httpd can be started up right away.  This is convenient when you're
       rotating your log files.

       In addition, a SIGHUP will attempt to close and re-open the log file.  This is a little tricky to set  up
       correctly,  for  instance if you are using chroot() then the log file must be within the chroot tree, but
       it's definitely doable.

</pre><h4><b>CERTIFICATES</b></h4><pre>
       If you're going to serve SSL/HTTPS you will need a server certificate.  There are a  bunch  of  companies
       that  will  issue  one  for  you;  see  the  lists at <a href="http://www.apache-ssl.org/">http://www.apache-ssl.org/</a>#Digital_Certificates and
       <a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.4/ssl_faq.html">http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.4/ssl_faq.html</a>#ToC23

       You can also create one for yourself, using the openssl tool.  Step one - create the key and  certificate
       request:
           openssl req -new &gt; cert.csr
       Step two ‐ remove the passphrase from the key:
           openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out key.pem
       Step three ‐ convert the certificate request into a signed certificate:
           openssl x509 -in cert.csr -out cert.pem -req -signkey key.pem -days 365
       This  creates  four  files.   The  ones  you  want are cert.pem and key.pem.  You don't need cert.csr and
       privkey.pem, and may remove them.
