       bos_status - Displays the status of server processes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bos</b> <b>status</b> <b>-server</b> &lt;<u>machine</u> <u>name</u>&gt;  [-instance &lt;<u>server</u> <u>process</u> <u>name</u>&gt;+] [<b>-long</b>]  [<b>-cell</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;]
       [<b>-noauth</b>]  [<b>-localauth</b>]  [<b>-help</b>]

       <b>bos</b> <b>stat</b> <b>-s</b> &lt;<u>machine</u> <u>name</u>&gt;  [-i &lt;<u>server</u> <u>process</u> <u>name</u>&gt;+] [<b>-lon</b>]  [<b>-c</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;]  [<b>-n</b>]  [<b>-loc</b>]  [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The bos status command reports the status of processes on the server machine named by the <b>-server</b>
       argument, either

       •   All of the AFS server processes listed in the <u>/etc/openafs/BosConfig</u> file

       •   Only these processes named by the -instance argument

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-server</b> &lt;<u>machine</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           Indicates  the  server  machine for which to report server process status. Identify the machine by IP
           address or its host name (either fully-qualified or  abbreviated  unambiguously).  For  details,  see
           <b><a href="../man8/bos.8.html">bos</a></b>(8).

       -instance
           Names  each  process  for  which  to  report status. Use the process name assigned with the <b>-instance</b>
           argument to the <b>bos</b> command. The output from the <b>bos</b> <b>status</b> command lists the names.

       -long
           Produces more detailed status information.

       <b>-cell</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument with  the  <b>-localauth</b>  flag.
           For more details, see <b><a href="../man8/bos.8.html">bos</a></b>(8).

       <b>-noauth</b>
           Assigns  the  unprivileged  identity  "anonymous"  to  the  issuer. Do not combine this flag with the
           <b>-localauth</b> flag. For more details, see <b><a href="../man8/bos.8.html">bos</a></b>(8).

       <b>-localauth</b>
           Constructs  a  server  ticket  using  a   key   from   the   local   <u>/etc/openafs/server/KeyFile</u>   or
           <u>/etc/openafs/server/KeyFileExt</u>  file.  The  <b>bos</b>  command  interpreter  presents the ticket to the BOS
           Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this flag with the <b>-cell</b> or <b>-noauth</b> options.  For
           more details, see <b><a href="../man8/bos.8.html">bos</a></b>(8).

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The  output for a process includes at least one line, which reports one of the following as the process's
       current status:

       •   "currently running normally". The process's status flag in the <b>BosConfig</b>  file  is  "Run".  For  <b>cron</b>
           entries,  this  message  indicates only that the command is scheduled to run, not necessarily that it
           was executing when the <b>bos</b> <b>status</b> command was issued.

       •   "disabled". The process is not running, and its <b>BosConfig</b> status flag is "NotRun".

       •   "temporarily disabled". The process is not running although its status flag in the <b>BosConfig</b> file  is
           "Run". Either an administrator used the <b>bos</b> <b>shutdown</b> command to stop it, or the

       •   BOS  Server  stopped  trying  to  restart  it after numerous failed attempts. In the second case, the
           auxiliary message is "stopped for too many errors".

       •   "temporarily enabled". The process is running although its status  flag  in  the  <b>BosConfig</b>  file  is
           "NotRun". An administrator has used the <b>bos</b> <b>startup</b> command to start it.

       If  one  of  the following special circumstances applies to the process, the indicated message appears in
       its entry:

       •   "has core file". The process failed and created a core file in the <u>/var/log/openafs</u> directory. If the
           BOS Server was able to restart the process after  the  failure,  the  primary  status  is  "currently
           running normally".

       •   "stopped for too many  errors". The reason for the primary status "temporarily  disabled" is that the
           BOS Server's attempts to restart the process all failed.

       The  entry  for  the fs process always includes a second line to report the process's "Auxiliary status",
       which is one of the following:

       •   "file server running". The File Server and Volume Server components of the File  Server  process  are
           running normally.

       •   "salvaging  file  system".  The  Salvager  is  running,  so  the  File  Server  and Volume Server are
           temporarily disabled. The BOS Server restarts them as soon as the Salvager is finished.

       The entry for a cron process includes an "Auxiliary status" that  reports  when  the  command  will  next
       execute.

       If the -long flag is used, each entry includes the following additional information:

       •   The process's type ("simple", "fs", or "cron").

       •   The day and time the process last started or restarted.

       •   The  number  of  "proc  starts",  which is how many times the BOS Server has started or restarted the
           process since it started itself.

       •   The "Last exit" time when the process (or one of the component processes  in  the  <b>fs</b>  process)  last
           terminated. This line does not appear if the process has not terminated since the BOS Server started.

       •   The  "Last  error  exit"  time when the process (or one of the component processes in the <b>fs</b> process)
           last failed due to an error. A further explanation  such  as  "due  to  shutdown  request"  sometimes
           appears. This line does not appear if the process has not failed since the BOS Server started.

       •   Each  command  that the BOS Server invokes to start the process, as specified by the <b>-cmd</b> argument to
           the <b>bos</b> <b>create</b> command.

       •   The pathname of the notifier program that the BOS Server invokes  when  the  process  terminates  (if
           any), as specified by the <b>-notifier</b> argument to the <b>bos</b> <b>create</b> command.

       If the -long flag is provided and the BOS Server discovers that the mode bits on files and subdirectories
       in the local <u>/usr/afs</u> directory differ from the expected values, it prints the following warning message:

          Bosserver reports inappropriate access on server directories

       The  following  chart  summarizes  the expected mode bit settings. A question mark indicates that the BOS
       Server does not check that bit.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following example command displays the status of processes on the machine <b>fs3.example.com</b>:

          % bos status fs3.example.com
          Instance buserver, currently running normally.
          Instance kaserver, currently running normally.
          Instance ptserver, currently running normally.
          Instance vlserver, currently running normally.
          Instance fs, has core file, currently running normally.
              Auxiliary status is: file server running.
          Instance upserver, currently running normally.

       The following example command displays a detailed status report for the <b>fs</b> and <b>ptserver</b> processes on  the
       machine <b>fs1.example.com</b>.

          % bos status -server fs1.example.com -instance fs ptserver -long
          Instance fs, (type is fs), currently running normally.
             Auxiliary status is: file server running.
             Process last started at Wed Jan 7 5:34:49 1998 (3 proc starts)
             Last exit at Wed Jan 7 5:34:49 1998
             Last error exit at Wed Jan 7 5:34:49 1998, due to shutdown
                 request
             Command 1 is '/usr/lib/openafs/fileserver'
             Command 2 is '/usr/lib/openafs/volserver'
             Command 3 is '/usr/lib/openafs/salvager'
          Instance ptserver, (type is simple) currently running normally.
             Process last started at Tue Jan 6 8:29:19 1998 (1 proc starts)
             Command 1 is '/usr/lib/openafs/ptserver'
