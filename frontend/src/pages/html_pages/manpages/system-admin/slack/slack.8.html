</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       slack - Sysadmin's lazy autoconfiguration kit

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>slack</b> [<u>option</u> <u>...</u>] [<u>role</u> <u>...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       slack is a master command which coordinates the activities of its backends, which variously:

       •      determine the list of roles to be installed on this server

       •      create a local cached copy of the role files from the central repository

       •      merge file trees from subroles into a single, unified tree

       •      install files onto the local filesystem

       •      run scripts before and after installation

       Options you give to slack will be generally passed along to the backends where relevant.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print a usage statement.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the version and exit.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Increase verbosity.  Can be specified multiple times.

       <b>--quiet</b>
              Don't be verbose (Overrides previous uses of --verbose).

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--config</b> <b>FILE</b>
              Use the specfied FILE for configuration instead of the default, <u>/etc/slack.conf</u>.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--source</b> <b>DIR</b>
              Source directory for slack files

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--rsh</b> <b>COMMAND</b>
              Remote shell for rsync

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--cache</b> <b>DIR</b>
              Local cache directory for slack files

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--stage</b> <b>DIR</b>
              Local staging directory for slack files

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--root</b> <b>DIR</b>
              Root destination for slack files

       <b>--no-sync</b>
              Skip the slack-sync step (useful if you're pushing stuff into the CACHE outside slack).

       <b>--no-files</b>
              Don't install any files in ROOT, but tell rsync to print what it would do.

       <b>--no-scripts</b>
              Don't run scripts

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>
              Same as --no-files --no-scripts  (CACHE, STAGE will still be updated)

       <b>--role-list</b>
              Role list for <b><a href="../man8/slack-getroles.8.html">slack-getroles</a></b>(8).

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--backup</b>
              Make  backups of existing files in ROOT that are overwritten.  This option defaults to on if it is
              not set to 0 in a config file or disabled with --nobackup on the command line.

       <b>--backup-dir</b>
              Put backups from the <b>--backup</b> option into this directory.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hostname</b> <b>HOST</b>
              Pretend to be running on HOST, instead of the name given by <a href="../man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname</a>(2).

       <b>--preview</b> <b>MODE</b>
              Do a diff of scripts and files before running them.  MODE can be one of 'simple' or 'prompt'  (See
              PREVIEW MODES, below).

       <b>--diff</b> <b>PROG</b>
              Use this diff program for previews.

       <b>--sleep</b> <b>TIME</b>
              Randomly sleep between 1 and TIME seconds before starting operations.  Useful in crontabs.

</pre><h4><b>PREVIEW</b> <b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       Preview  functionality  is new in slack 0.14.0.  I haven't quite worked out how things will work, so this
       usage is somewhat subject to change in future versions.  I thought I would try it this way  and  see  how
       people like it.

       In  'simple'  mode, after syncing and staging the files directory, slack will present a diff of the files
       and scripts.  In this mode, slack will not run the preinstall or fixfiles scripts, and because  of  this,
       it may provide some false output about permissions changes to files.

       In  'prompt'  mode,  after syncing and staging the files directory, slack will diff the script directory.
       If there are differences, slack will present them to you and ask you if you want to continue.  If you say
       no, it will exit.  If you say yes, it will stage the scripts directory, run the preinstall  and  fixfiles
       scripts,  and  then  diff the files in the stage with those in the root.  If there are differences, slack
       will present them to you and ask you if you want to continue.  If you say no, it will exit.  If  you  say
       yes, it will install the files and run the postinstall script.

       So,  the 'simple' mode is easy to use, and will be accurate if you don't use fixfiles.  The 'prompt' mode
       will be accurate if you use fixfiles, but requires some interaction.

       Why can't we just have one mode that works with fixfiles and requires no interaction?  Well,  that  would
       require  slack  to understand what your free-form fixfiles executable was going to do, which would either
       require some kind of universe simulator or would require you to write your fixfiles in a  less  free-form
       way, which would make slack less like slack.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To install all the roles configured in the role list for a server:
              slack

       To install a specific role:
              slack <u>rolename</u>

       To test a new role before checking in the changes:
              slack --source <u>user</u>@<u>workstation</u>:<a href="file:/home/">/home/</a><u>user</u>/.../slack <u>rolename</u>

       To avoid killing your master server when calling from cron:
              slack --sleep 3600
