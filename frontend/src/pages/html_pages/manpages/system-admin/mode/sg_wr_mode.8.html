       sg_wr_mode - write (modify) SCSI mode page

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sg_wr_mode</b>  [<u>--cfile=CF</u>]  [<u>--contents=H,H...</u>]  [<u>--dbd</u>]  [<u>--force</u>]  [<u>--help</u>]  [<u>--len=10|6</u>] [<u>--mask=M,M...</u>]
       [<u>--page=PG_H[,SPG_H]</u>] [<u>--raw</u>] [<u>--rtd</u>] [<u>--save</u>] [<u>--six</u>] [<u>--verbose</u>] [<u>--version</u>] <u>DEVICE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Writes a modified mode page to <u>DEVICE</u>. Uses the SCSI MODE SENSE (6 or 10 byte variant) command  to  fetch
       the  existing mode data which includes a mode page (or subpage). It then combines that with the contents,
       potentially masked, and writes the modified mode page with the SCSI MODE SELECT (6 or  10  byte  variant)
       command.  This  utility  does not modify the block descriptor(s); if any block descriptors are fetched by
       the MODE SENSE command then the same block descriptors are written back with the  following  MODE  SELECT
       command.

       If the <u>--rtd</u> option is given then most other options apart from <u>--save</u>, <u>--len=</u>10|6 and <u>--six</u> are ignored.
       In  this case only a MODE SELECT command is sent to the <u>DEVICE</u> with the RTD bit (Revert To Defaults) set.
       This bit was added to this command in SPC-5 revision 11,  so  older  devices  may  not  support  it.  The
       Extended  Inquiry VPD page has the RTD_SUP bit to indicate whether the <u>DEVICE</u> supports the RTD bit in the
       MODE SELECT(6 and 10) commands. When the <u>--rtd</u> option is given the rest of this section can be ignored.

       If a contents option is not given then the various components (i.e.  header, block descriptor(s) and mode
       page) of the "current" values of the existing mode page are printed out. In this case the  mode  page  is
       not altered on the device.

       If  the  contents  are  specified, and a mask is not specified, then the contents must match the existing
       mode page in various aspects unless the <u>--force</u> option is given. These include length, mode page code and
       subpage code if applicable. If all is well then the contents string is written to <u>DEVICE</u> as the new  mode
       page.

       If  both contents and mask strings are specified then only bit positions in the contents corresponding to
       set bits in the mask are taken while the existing mode page supplies bit positions corresponding to clear
       bits.  When a mask is given then the mask and/or the contents may be shorter than the existing mode page.
       If the mask is shorter than the contents then the remaining bytes are taken from  the  contents.  If  the
       contents are shorter than the existing mode page then the remaining bytes are taken from the existing mod
       page.

       The  force  option allows the contents string to be written as the new mode page without any prior checks
       on the existing mode page. This should only be required for vendor specific mode pages. The existing mode
       data is ignored apart from the block descriptors which can be suppressed with the <u>--dbd</u>  option  if  need
       be.

       Changing  individual  fields  in a mode page is probably more easily done with the sdparm utility. Fields
       can be identified by acronym or by a numerical descriptor.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--cfile</b>=<u>CF</u>
              where <u>CF</u> is a file name containing the mode page. See the "HEX, BINARY AND JSON  FORMATS"  section
              in the sg3_utils manpage for more information. If the <u>--raw</u> option is also given then the contents
              of <u>FN</u> are treated as binary.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--contents</b>=<u>H,H...</u>
              where  <u>H,H...</u>  is  a  string of comma separated hex numbers each of which should resolve to a byte
              value (i.e. 0 to ff inclusive). A (single) space separated string of hex numbers is  also  allowed
              but  the  list  needs  to be in quotes. This is the new contents of the mode page to be written to
              <u>DEVICE</u>, potentially filtered by the mask string.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--contents</b>=-
              reads contents string from stdin. See the <u>--cfile=CF</u> option above.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--dbd</b>
              disable block descriptors (DBD flag in cdb). Some device types include block  descriptors  in  the
              mode  data  returned  by a MODE SENSE command. If so the same block descriptors are written by the
              MODE SELECT command.  This option instructs the  MODE  SENSE  command  not  to  return  any  block
              descriptors.  This  would  be a sensible default for this utility apart from the fact that not all
              SCSI devices support the DBD bit in the cdb.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
              force the contents string to be taken as the new mode page, or at least doesn't do checks  on  the
              existing  mode  page. Note that <u>DEVICE</u> may still reject the new contents for the mode page. Cannot
              be given with the <u>--mask=M,M...</u> option.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              output the usage message then exit.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--len</b>=10 | 6
              length of the SCSI commands (cdb) sent to <u>DEVICE</u>. The default is 10 so 10 byte MODE SENSE and MODE
              SELECT commands are issued. Some old devices don't support the 10 byte variants hence this option.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mask</b>=<u>M,M...</u>
              where <u>M,M...</u> is a string of comma separated hex numbers each of which should  resolve  to  a  byte
              value  (i.e.  0 to ff inclusive). A (single) space separated string of hex numbers is also allowed
              but the list needs to be in quotes. The mask chooses (bit by bit) whether the new mode page  comes
              from  the  contents  (mask  bit set) or from the existing mode page (mask bit clear).  If the mask
              string is shorter than the contents string then the remaining bytes are taken  from  the  contents
              string. If the contents string is shorter than the existing mode page then the remaining bytes are
              taken from the existing mode page (i.e. they are left unaltered).

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--page</b>=<u>PG_H</u>
              where  <u>PG_H</u>  is  the  page  code  value to fetch and modify. The page code is in hex and should be
              between 0 and 3e inclusive. Notice that page code 3f to fetch all mode pages is disallowed.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--page</b>=<u>PG_H,SPG_H</u>
              where <u>PG_H</u> is the page code value and <u>SPG_H</u> is the subpage code value to fetch  and  modify.  Both
              values are in hex. The subpage code should be between 0 and fe inclusive. Notice that subpage code
              ff  to  fetch  all mode subpages (for a given mode page or all mode pages in the case of 3f,ff) is
              disallowed.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>
              when this option is given then the file given by the <u>--cfile=CF</u> option is treated as  binary  (the
              default is to treat it as ASCII hexadecimal).

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--rtd</b>
              when  this  option  is given most other actions are bypassed and a MODE SELECT(6 or 10) command is
              sent to the <u>DEVICE</u> with the RTD bit set.  This will cause all current values (and saved values  if
              the <u>--save</u> option is also given) of all mode pages to be reverted to their default values.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--save</b>
              changes  the "saved" mode page when MODE SELECT is successful. By default (i.e. when <u>--save</u> is not
              used) only the "current" mode page values are changed when MODE SELECT is successful. In this case
              the new mode page will stay in effect until the device is reset (e.g.   power  cycled).   When  it
              restarts  the  "saved" values for the mode page will be re-instated.  So to make changes permanent
              use the <u>--save</u> option.
              When used with the <u>--rtd</u> option then both the current and saved  values  in  each  mode  page  are
              reverted  to their default values. In the absence of <u>--save</u> option only the current values in each
              mode page are reverted to their default values.

       <b>-6</b>, <b>--six</b>
              this option will cause the 6 byte variants of MODE SENSE and MODE SELECT commands to be used.  The
              default is to use the 10 byte options. This option is equivalent to using the <u>--len=6</u> option.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print the version string and then exit.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This  utility does not check whether the contents string is trying to modify parts of the mode page which
       are changeable. The device should do that and if some part is  not  changeable  then  it  should  report:
       "Invalid field in parameter list".

       Some  mode  pages are not saveable. If so an attempt to use the <u>--save</u> option should cause an error to be
       reported from the device: "Illegal field in cdb".

       The device is required to do various checks before it accepts a new mode page. If these checks fail  then
       the mode page is not altered and either a "parameter list length error" or an "invalid field in parameter
       list" error is returned by the device in the sense data.

       The  recommended  way  to modify a mode page is to read it with a MODE SENSE, modify some part of it then
       write it back to the device with a MODE SELECT command. For example, reading an existing mode page can be
       accomplished with 'sg_modes -p=1a -r /dev/sdb &gt; mp_1a.txt' (the power condition mode page). The mp_1a.txt
       file can be edited and then used as the contents string to this utility (e.g. 'sg_wr_mode -p 1a -s  -c  -
       /dev/sdb &lt; mp_1a.txt').

       Two  fields differ between what is read from the device with MODE SENSE and what is written to the device
       with MODE SELECT: the mode data length is reserved (i.e. zero(es)) in a MODE SELECT command while the  PS
       bit  ((sub)page byte 0 bit 7) in each mode (sub)page is reserved (zero) in a MODE SELECT command.  The PS
       bit given in the contents string is zeroed unless the <u>--force</u> option is selected.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This utility can be used together with the sg_modes utility. To re-instate the default mode  page  values
       (i.e.  the  mode page values chosen by the manufacturer of the device) as both the current and saved mode
       page values the following sequence could be used:

         $ sg_modes --control=2 --page=1a -r /dev/sda &gt; t

         $ sg_wr_mode --page=1a --contents=- --save /dev/sda &lt; t

       Next is an example of using a mask to modify the "idle condition counter" of the "power  condition"  mode
       page  (0x1a)  from  0x28  to 0x37. Note that the change is not saved so the "idle condition counter" will
       revert to 0x28 after the next power cycle. The output from sg_modes is abridged.

        $ sg_modes --page=1a /dev/hdc
        &gt;&gt; Power condition (mmc), page_control: current
        00     1a 0a 00 03 00 00 00 28  00 00 01 2c

        $ sg_wr_mode -p 1a -c 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,37 -m 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ff /dev/hdc

        $ sg_modes -p 1a /dev/hdc
        &gt;&gt; Power condition (mmc), page_control: current
        00     1a 0a 00 03 00 00 00 37  00 00 01 2c

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_wr_mode is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.
