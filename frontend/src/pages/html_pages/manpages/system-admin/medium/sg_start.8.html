</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       sg_start sends a SCSI START STOP UNIT command to the <u>DEVICE</u> with the  selected  options.  The  most  used
       options  are  <u>--stop</u>  to  spin down a disk and <u>--start</u> to spin up a disk. Using <u>--start</u> on a disk that is
       already spinning is harmless. There is also finer grain control with "power condition": active,  idle  or
       standby.  This  is  set  with  the <u>--pc=PC</u> option. In some contexts the "stop" state can be considered an
       additional power condition.

       Devices that contain removable media such as cd/dvds can use the <u>--loej</u> option to load  the  medium  when
       used  in  conjunction  with  <u>--start</u> (i.e. load medium then spin up). Alternatively <u>--loej</u> may be used to
       eject the medium when used in conjunction with <u>--stop</u> (i.e. spin down then eject  medium).  More  simply,
       the loading or ejecting of a removable medium can be requested with the <u>--load</u> or <u>--eject</u>' option.

       If no option or argument is given then a <u>--start</u> is assumed; as the utility's name suggests.

       This  utility  supports  two  command line syntaxes, the preferred one is shown first in the synopsis and
       explained in this section. A later section on the old command line syntax outlines the  second  group  of
       options.

       Linux note: best not to use a standard block device name (e.g. /dev/sdc) with the <u>--stop</u> option. Use a sg
       or bsg device node instead (see <a href="../man8/lsscsi.8.html">lsscsi</a>(8) ). The block layer will sometimes notice the disk spinning down
       and decide: "that's not right" and spin it up again!

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       <b>0</b>      same action as <u>--stop</u>.

       <b>1</b>      same action as <u>--start</u>.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--eject</b>
              stop  the medium and eject it from the drive. Only appropriate for a device with removable medium.
              Might be ignored (prevented), see below.  Note, this is an operation that can be done  on  a  tape
              drive or CD/DVD/BD player, not on a hard disk or SSD!

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              print out the usage message then exit.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--fl</b>=<u>FL</u>
              sets  the format layer number for the disc to "jump" to (defined in MMC-5).  Values of <u>FL</u> can be 0
              to 3. When this option is chosen, the FL, LoEj and Start bits are set in the cdb  as  required  by
              MMC-5; thus the user does not need to set the <u>--start</u> and/or <u>--load</u> options.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--immed</b>
              sets  the  IMM  bit on the START STOP UNIT command so this utility will return immediately and not
              wait for the media to complete the requested action. The default is to wait  until  the  media  to
              complete the requested action before returning.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--load</b>
              load the medium in the drive and start it. Only appropriate for a removable medium.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--loej</b>
              sets the LOEJ bit on the START STOP UNIT command. This loads the media when the unit is started or
              eject  it when the unit is stopped (i.e.  works in conjunction with START bit in cdb). This option
              is ignored if 'pc &gt; 0'.  Default is off (i.e.  don't  attempt  to  load  or  eject  media).  If  a
              start/start  indication  is  not  given (i.e. neither <u>--start</u> nor <u>--stop</u>) and this option is given
              then a load and start action is assumed.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mod</b>=<u>PC_MOD</u>
              where <u>PC_MOD</u> is the 'power condition modifier' value. 0 to 15 (inclusive) are valid and 0  is  the
              default. This  'power condition modifier' field in the cdb was added after sbc3r13.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--noflush</b>
              do  not  perform  a  flush  to  media  (e.g. like SYNCHRONIZE CACHE does) before a variant of this
              utility that limits access to the media. Using the <b>--stop</b> option is an example of  something  that
              limits access to the media. This 'noflush' field in the cdb was added after sbc3r13.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--old</b>
              Switch to older style options. Please use as first option.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pc</b>=<u>PC</u>
              where <u>PC</u> is the 'power conditions' value. 0 to 15 (inclusive) are valid.  Default value is 0. When
              '--pc=0' then <b>--eject</b>, <b>--load</b>, <b>--loej</b>, <b>--start</b> and <b>--stop</b> are active. Some common values are 1 for
              the  "active"  power  condition  (SBC);  2  for  the idle power condition; 3 for the standby power
              condition; 5 for sleep power condition (MMC);  7  for  LU_CONTROL  (SBC),  0xa  (decimal  10)  for
              FORCE_IDLE_0 (SBC) and 0xb (decimal 11) for FORCE_STANDBY_0 (SBC). See recent SBC-3, MMC-5 and SAS
              drafts at www.t10.org for more information.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--readonly</b>
              open  the  <u>DEVICE</u>  in  read-only  mode.  Maybe required in Linux to stop a nuisance spin-up if the
              <u>DEVICE</u> is an ATA disk. The nuisance spin-up may occur at the end  of  this  command  negating  the
              effect of the <u>--stop</u> option.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--start</b>
              start  (spin-up)  the  <u>DEVICE</u>. This sets the START bit in the cdb. Using this option on an already
              started device is harmless. In the absence of other options, this option defaults  (i.e.  set  the
              START cdb bit).

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--stop</b>
              stop  (spin-down)  the  <u>DEVICE</u>. This clears the START bit in the cdb.  This operation is typically
              done on a hard disk or SSD. In the case of a SSD it will be placed in low power mode and may  need
              a start operation later before normal IO can resume.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase the level of verbosity. Can be used multiple times.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print out version string then exit.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       To avoid confusion, only one of <u>0</u>, <u>1</u> <u>--eject</u>, <u>--load</u>, <u>--start</u> and <u>--stop</u> should be given.

       There  is  an  associated  "power  condition"  mode  page  (0x1a)  in  which  timer values can be set for
       transitioning to either idle or standby state after a period of inactivity. The  sdparm  utility  can  be
       used  to  view  the power condition mode page and if required change it. If a <u>DEVICE</u> is in either idle or
       standby power condition state then a REQUEST SENSE command (see the sg_requests utility) should  yield  a
       sense key of "no sense" and an additional sense code of "Low power condition on" on recent SCSI devices.

       Ejection  of removable media (e.g. 'sg_start --eject /dev/hdd' where the <u>DEVICE</u> is an ATAPI cd/dvd drive)
       may be prevented by a prior SCSI PREVENT ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL command (see sg_prevent). In this case this
       utility should fail with an error generated by the device: illegal request /  medium  removal  prevented.
       This can be overridden using sg_prevent or, for example, 'sdparm --command=unlock /dev/hdd'.

       The  SCSI  TEST UNIT READY command can be used to find out whether a <u>DEVICE</u> is ready to transfer data. If
       rotating media is stopped or still coming up to speed, then the TEST UNIT READY command will yield a "not
       ready" sense key and an more informative additional sense code. See the sg_turs utility.

       In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the <u>DEVICE</u> must be a SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block
       devices (e.g. SCSI disks and DVD drives) can also be specified. For example "sg_start  0  /dev/sda"  will
       work in the 2.6 series kernels.

       In the Linux 2.6 series, especially with ATA disks, using this utility to stop (spin down) a disk may not
       be sufficient and other mechanisms will start the disk again some time later. The user might additionally
       mark  the disk as "offline" with 'echo offline &gt; /sys/block/sda/device/state' where sda is the block name
       of the disk. To restart the disk "offline" can be replaced with "running". Note that once the 'state'  is
       set to offline, no SCSI commands can be sent to the device until it is set back to running. Also stopping
       a  disk via a pass-through interface (e.g. /dev/sg1 or /dev/bsg/1:0:0:0) may reduce unwanted side effects
       (such as restarting it again when this utility completes).

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_start is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

</pre><h4><b>OLDER</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options in this section were the only ones available prior to sg3_utils version  1.23  .  Since  then
       this utility defaults to the newer command line options which can be overridden by using <u>--old</u> (or <u>-O</u>) as
       the  first  option. See the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section for another way to force the use of these older
       command line options.

       Note that the action of <u>--loej</u> is slightly different in the older interface:  when  neither  <u>--start</u>  nor
       <u>--stop</u>  (nor  proxies  for them) are given, <u>--loej</u> performs an eject operation. In the same situation the
       newer interface will perform a load operation.

       Earlier versions of sg_start had a '-s' option to perform a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command  before  the  START
       STOP UNIT command was issued. According to recent SBC-2 drafts this is done implicitly if required. Hence
       the '-s' option has been dropped.

       All  options,  other  than  '-v'  and '-V', can be given with a single "-".  For example: "sg_start -stop
       /dev/sda"  and  "sg_start  --stop  /dev/sda"  are  equivalent.  The  single  "-"  form  is  for  backward
       compatibility.

       <b>0</b>      stop (spin-down) <u>DEVICE</u>.

       <b>1</b>      start (spin-up) <u>DEVICE</u>.

       <b>--eject</b>
              stop the medium and eject it from the drive.

       <b>--fl</b>=<u>FL</u>
              sets the format layer number for the disc to "jump" to (defined in MMC-5).

       <b>-i</b>     sets  the  IMM  bit on the START STOP UNIT command so this utility will return immediately and not
              wait for the media to spin down. Same effect as '--imm=1'. The default action (without this option
              or a '--imm=1' option) is to wait until the media spins down before returning.

       <b>--imm</b>=<u>0|1</u>
              when the immediate bit is 1 then this utility returns immediately after the  <u>DEVICE</u>  has  received
              the  command.  When  this  option is 0 (the default) then the utility returns once the command has
              completed its action (i.e. it waits until the device is started or stopped).

       <b>--load</b> load the medium in the drive and start it.

       <b>--loej</b> sets the LOEJ bit in the START STOP UNIT cdb. When a "start" operation is indicated, then  a  load
              and  start is performed. When a "stop" operation is indicated, then a stop and eject is performed.
              When neither a "start" or "stop" operation is indicated does a stop and eject. [Note that the last
              action differs from the new interface in which the option  of  this  name  defaults  to  load  and
              start.]

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--new</b>
              Switch to the newer style options.

       <b>--mod</b>=<u>PC_MOD</u>
              where  <u>PC_MOD</u>  is the 'power condition modifier' value. 0 to 15 (inclusive) are valid and 0 is the
              default. This field was added after sbc3r13.

       <b>--noflush</b>
              do not perform a flush to media (e.g. like SYNCHRONIZE  CACHE  does)  before  a  variant  of  this
              utility  that  limits access to the media. Using the <b>--stop</b> option is an example of something that
              limits access to the media. This field was added after sbc3r13.

       <b>--pc</b>=<u>PC</u>
              where <u>PC</u> is the 'power condition' value (in hex). 0 to f (inclusive) are valid. Default  value  is
              0.

       <b>-r</b>     see the <u>--readonly</u> option above. May be useful for ATA disks.

       <b>--start</b>
              start (spin-up) <u>DEVICE</u>.

       <b>--stop</b> stop (spin-down) <u>DEVICE</u>. Same meaning as "0" argument.

       <b>-v</b>     verbose:  outputs  SCSI  command  in hex to console before with executing it. '-vv' and '-vvv' are
              also accepted yielding greater verbosity.

       <b>-V</b>     print out version string then exit.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Since sg3_utils version 1.23 the environment variable SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS can be given. When it is present
       this utility will expect the older command line options. So the presence of this environment variable  is
       equivalent to using <u>--old</u> (or <u>-O</u>) as the first command line option.
