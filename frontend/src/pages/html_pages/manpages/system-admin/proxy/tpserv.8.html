       <b>tpserv</b> - program that implements a proxy

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tpserv</b> [<b>-V</b>] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-h</b>] [<b>-D</b>] [<b>-c</b>] [<b>-p</b> <u>port</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tpserv</b> is a program that implements a proxy, a attack or whatever you want to call it.

       It  just  listens on DST_PORT_PROXY that is configurable with <b>-p</b> option and receives the reassembled data
       stream from kernel.

       Currently this program supports a mode in which echoes everything back to the src host  or  the  mode  in
       that it connects to destination to which the client wanted to connect and relay everything from client to
       that destination and everything from destination to the client. See the limitations on how the connection
       will look like on destination host.

       It  is  possible  to insert some code to this program to modify data from/to source/destination (but this
       you will have to do yourself).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Show help message and exit.

       <b>-V</b>     Print version.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose mode (prints connections).

       <b>-vv</b>    Even more verbose (prints connections and received/send packets).

       <b>-D</b>     Daemon mode.

       <b>-c</b>     Connection mode (default is echo mode).

       <b>-p</b> <b>[</b><u>port</u><b>]</b>
              Set DST_PORT_PROXY listen.

       HOW IT WORKS TOGETHER - HUNT/TRANSPROXY/TPSERV

         Here is small example how to use together hunt, transproxy and tpserv.

         1. At the beginning run tpsetup/transproxy program.
            The default destination port is 7000 and redirecting port is 7044.

         2. Run tpserv/tpserv -v (or -vv).

         3. Run hunt and enter arp spoof daemon menu. Do not start the daemon unless
            you modify the tpsetup/transproxy script "i" insert the single arp spoof
            in this order:
                 - IP address (name) of your gateway or IP address (name) of destination
                   host if the host is in the same IP subnet as source host.
                 - as fake mac address enter 'my' or enter your interface MAC address.
                 - enter IP address (name) of source host (client) from which you want
                   to receive data - connections.
                 - optionally enter refresh interval "t" test if the spoof was successful.

         4. from the source host try to run telnet 1.1.1.1 7000 (or telnet
            destination_name 7000) and type some chars. The chars should be echoed back
            by tpserv program.

         You can then play little bit with DST_PORT setting in setup/transproxy script
         and/or -c option of tpserv program or change tpserv to modify data going
         from/to source/destination.
