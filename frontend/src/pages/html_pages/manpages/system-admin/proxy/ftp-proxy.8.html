</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ftp-proxy - application level proxy for the FTP protocol

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ftp-proxy</b> <b>[-c]</b> <b>[-d|-i]</b> <b>[-f</b> <b>file]</b> <b>[-n]</b> <b>[-v</b> <b>level]</b> <b>[-V]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FTP-Proxy</b>  acts  as an application level gateway between FTP clients and servers.  Its main purpose is to
       secure local FTP servers against possibly insecure clients or malicious attacks.  FTP-Proxy  is  believed
       to be immune against current known attacks based on the FTP protocol.

       FTP-Proxy  can  be  started from the inetd (or xinetd, or any other) internet super daemon or executed on
       its own as a standalone daemon, in which case it will fork child processes to  handle  connections.   The
       behaviour  depends on the <b><a href="../man5/ftp-proxy.conf.5.html">ftp-proxy.conf</a>(5)</b> configuration option <b>ServerType</b> or the <b>-i</b> and <b>-d</b> command line
       switches, where the latter two take precedence.

       FTP-Proxy features a rich set of auditing and command restriction capabilities and is specifically suited
       for deployment in firewall environments.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-V</b>     Print the program's version information and terminate with exit code 0.

       <b>-c</b>     Read the configuration file, output its contents sorted by section and  option  name  to  standard
              output,  and  terminate  with  exit  code  0.   This  option  is mostly interesting for diagnostic
              purposes.

       <b>-d</b>     Force FTP-Proxy to run in standalone (daemon) mode, even if a <b>ServerType</b> <b>inetd</b> directive exists in
              the configuration file.

       <b>-i</b>     Force FTP-Proxy to run in inetd mode, even if a <b>ServerType</b>  <b>standalone</b>  directive  exists  in  the
              configuration file.

       <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>
              Specify  an  alternate configuration file to be read instead of the standard <b>/etc/proxy-suite/ftp-</b>
              <b>proxy.conf</b> file.

              Please note that the default path for the configuration file is a compile time option. It  can  be
              changed  using  the <b>--prefix</b> and <b>--sysconfdir</b> options when running the <b>configure</b> script - see also
              the <b>INSTALL</b> file for usage description.

       <b>-n</b>     Do not detach from the controlling terminal.  This prevents the default of becoming a  daemon  and
              is ignored if running in <b>inetd</b> mode.  The main purpose of this option is to support the AIX System
              Resource Controller or similar setups, where several daemons are controlled by a master daemon.

       <b>-v</b> <u>level</u>
              Enable  diagnostic output to be sent to the file <b>/tmp/ftp-proxy.debug</b>.  The given level must be in
              the range from 0 (no output at all) to 4 (maximum verbosity). See also <b>DIAGNOSTICS</b> bellow.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SIGTERM,</b> <b>SIGQUIT,</b> <b>SIGINT</b>
              These signals instruct FTP-Proxy to  abort  any  existing  transfer,  close  all  connections  and
              terminate  the  process.  If  the  target of the signal is a running FTP-Proxy daemon, all current
              child processes wil also be terminated.

       <b>SIGHUP</b> This signal will be accepted if running in daemon mode and ignored in inetd mode.
              It causes the FTP-Proxy to reread its configuration file and to reopen the log destination  if  it
              was changed in the configuration file, or rotated if it is a log file.
              See also dedicated rotation singnal <b>SIGUSR1</b> bellow.

       <b>SIGUSR1</b>
              This signal will be accepted if running in daemon mode and ignored in inetd mode.
              It  causes the FTP-Proxy to close its current logfile, rename it to a date and time derived value,
              and open a new logfile.  This procedure is also known as <u>Logfile</u> <u>Rotation</u>.  Child processes forked
              before the reception of this signal and processes run from <b>inetd</b> will not be affected.
              See also the <b>ServerRoot</b> configuration option in <b><a href="../man5/ftp-proxy.conf.5.html">ftp-proxy.conf</a>(5).</b>

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       When running FTP-Proxy in  <b>inetd</b>  mode,  it  is  always  an  excellent  idea  to  check  that  the  inetd
       configuration  file  includes  a  line  that invokes FTP-Proxy.  An example for a line in <b>/etc/inetd.conf</b>
       follows:

       <b>ftp</b> <b>stream</b> <b>tcp</b> <b>nowait</b> <b>root</b> <b>/usr/sbin/ftp-proxy</b> <b>-i</b>

       Please note that this is just an example and does not provide much  security,  like  running  as  a  non-
       privileged user or using the <b>TCP</b> <b>Wrapper</b> functionality.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>-v</b> option is is only available if enabled using the <b>--enable-debug</b> option when running the configure
       script - see also the <b>INSTALL</b> file for usage description.  This option should be  used  with  great  care
       only. It is strongly recommended to not to use it in production environments.

       If  debugging  is activated, it always adds output to the file <b>/tmp/ftp-proxy.debug</b> which is created with
       <b>0666</b> mode.  This allows child processes to open and write the file after they have given  up  their  root
       privileges.

       If  the  configuration file contains a <b>ServerRoot</b> directive, child processes and processes run from <b>inetd</b>
       will try to open the file within their <b><a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</a>(2)</b> environment.  If this fails, e.g. because  there  is  no
       <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> directory, it is silently ignored and no debug output is generated.

       Please  note  that  the  program  makes  no attempt to erase the debug file after use.  Thus it will stay
       around with world writeability until the operator manually removes it!
