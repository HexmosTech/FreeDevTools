</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       softirqs - Measure soft IRQ (soft interrupt) event time. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>softirqs</b> <b>[-h]</b> <b>[-T]</b> <b>[-N]</b> <b>[-C]</b> <b>[-d]</b> <b>[-c</b> <b>CPU]</b> <b>[interval]</b> <b>[count]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  summarizes  the  time spent servicing soft IRQs (soft interrupts), and can show this time as either
       totals or histogram distributions. A system-wide summary of this time is shown by  the  %soft  column  of
       <a href="../man1/mpstat.1.html">mpstat</a>(1), and soft IRQ event counts (but not times) are available in /proc/softirqs.

       This  tool  uses the irq:softirq_enter and irq:softirq_exit kernel tracepoints, which is a stable tracing
       mechanism. BPF programs can attach to tracepoints from Linux 4.7 only. An older version of this  tool  is
       available in tools/old, and uses kprobes instead of tracepoints.

       Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       CONFIG_BPF and bcc.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h     Print usage message.

       -T     Include timestamps on output.

       -N     Output in nanoseconds.

       -C     Show the number of soft irq events.

       -d     Show IRQ time distribution as histograms.

       -c CPU Trace on this CPU only.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Sum soft IRQ event time until Ctrl-C:
              # <b>softirqs</b>

       Show the number of soft irq events:
              # <b>softirqs</b> <b>-C</b>

       Show soft IRQ event time as histograms:
              # <b>softirqs</b> <b>-d</b>

       Print 1 second summaries, 10 times:
              # <b>softirqs</b> <b>1</b> <b>10</b>

       1 second summaries, printed in nanoseconds, with timestamps:
              # <b>softirqs</b> <b>-NT</b> <b>1</b>

       Sum soft IRQ event time on CPU 1 until Ctrl-C:
              # <b>softirqs</b> <b>-c</b> <b>1</b>

</pre><h4><b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       SOFTIRQ
              The kernel function name that performs the soft IRQ action.

       TOTAL_usecs
              Total time spent in this soft IRQ function in microseconds.

       TOTAL_nsecs
              Total time spent in this soft IRQ function in nanoseconds.

       usecs  Range of microseconds for this bucket.

       nsecs  Range of nanoseconds for this bucket.

       count  Number of soft IRQs in this time range.

       distribution
              ASCII representation of the distribution (the count column).

</pre><h4><b>OVERHEAD</b></h4><pre>
       This  traces  kernel  functions  and maintains in-kernel counts, which are asynchronously copied to user-
       space. While the rate of interrupts be very high (&gt;1M/sec), this is a relatively efficient way  to  trace
       these  events,  and  so  the  overhead  is  expected  to  be small for normal workloads, but could become
       noticeable for heavy workloads. Measure in a test environment before use.

</pre><h4><b>SOURCE</b></h4><pre>
       This is from bcc.

       Also look in the bcc distribution for a companion _examples.txt file containing  example  usage,  output,
       and commentary for this tool.

</pre><h4><b>OS</b></h4><pre>
       Linux

</pre><h4><b>STABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Unstable - in development.
