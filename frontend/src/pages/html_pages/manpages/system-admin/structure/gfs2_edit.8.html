</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gfs2_edit - Display, print or edit GFS2 or GFS internal structures.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gfs2_edit</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>DEVICE</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  gfs2_edit  command  is a tool used to examine, edit or display internal data structures of a GFS2 or
       GFS file system.  The gfs2_edit command can be run interactively, as described below in INTERACTIVE MODE.

       Caution: Several options of the gfs2_edit command alter the file  system  metadata  and  can  cause  file
       system corruption.  These options should be used with great care.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-p</b> [<u>struct</u> | <u>block</u>] [<u>blocktype</u>] [<u>blockalloc</u> <u>[val]</u>] [<u>blockbits</u>] [<u>blockrg</u>] [<u>find</u>
       <u>sb|rg|rb|di|in|lf|jd|lh|ld|ea|ed|lb|13|qc</u>] [<u>field</u> <u>&lt;field&gt;</u> <u>[val]</u>]
              Print  a  gfs2  data  structure  in human-readable format to stdout.  You can enter either a block
              number or a data structure name.  Block numbers may be specified in hex (e.g.,  0x10)  or  decimal
              (e.g., 16).

              You can specify the following well-known locations with the -p option.

              <u>sb</u>, <u>superblock</u> - Print the superblock.

              <u>root</u> - Print the root directory.

              <u>master</u> - Print the master system directory.

              <u>jindex</u> - Print the journal index system directory.

              <u>per_node</u> - Print the per_node system directory.

              <u>inum</u> - Print the system inum file.

              <u>statfs</u> - Print the system statfs file.

              <u>rindex</u>, <u>rgindex</u> - Print the resource group index system file.

              <u>rg</u> <u>X</u> - Print the resource group information for RG X (zero-based).

              <u>rgs</u> - Print the resource group information.

              <u>quota</u> - Print the contents of the system quota file.

              <u>identify</u> - Identify a data block rather than print the block's contents.

              <u>size</u> - Print the device size information.

              <u>journalX</u>  -  Print the contents of journal X, where X is a journal number from 0 to &lt;the number of
              journals in your file system - 1&gt;.  Only the journal headers and journal descriptors  are  dumped.
              For  journal  descriptors,  this  option  prints out every file system block number logged in that
              section of the journal.  The actual journaled blocks are not printed.

              If you specify a block number rather than a structure name, gfs2_edit will print out  a  breakdown
              of  the  structure for that block.  For example: <b>gfs2_edit</b> <b>-p</b> <b>sb</b> will print the superblock, but so
              does <b>gfs2_edit</b> <b>-p</b> <b>0x10</b> and <b>gfs2_edit</b> <b>-p</b> <b>16</b>.

              If you specify -p without a block or structure name, gfs2_edit prints the superblock.

              You can specify more than one data structure with a single -p option.  For example,  <b>gfs2_edit</b>  <b>-p</b>
              <b>inum</b> <b>statfs</b> <b>/dev/sda1</b> prints the system inum file and the system statfs file on /dev/sda1.

              Optionally,  you  may  specify  the  keyword  <u>blocktype</u>  to  print out the gfs2 block type for the
              specified block.  Valid gfs2 block types  are:  0  (Clump),  1  (Superblock),  2  (Resource  Group
              Header),  3 (Resource Group Bitmap), 4 (Dinode), 5 (Indirect Block), 6 (Leaf), 7 (Journaled data),
              8 (Log Header), 9 (Log descriptor), 10 (Extended attribute), 11 (Eattr Data), 12 (Log Buffer),  13
              (Invalid), and 14 (Quota Change).

              Optionally,  you may specify the keyword <u>blockalloc</u> with an optional value to assign.  If no value
              is specified, the blockalloc keyword will print the block allocation type for the specified block.
              Valid block allocation types are: 0 (Free block), 1  (Data  block),  2  (Unlinked  block),  and  3
              (Metadata  block).  If a value from 0 to 3 is specified, the resource group bitmap will be changed
              to the new value.  This may be used, for example, to artificially free  or  allocate  a  block  in
              order to test fsck.gfs2's ability to detect and fix the problem.

              Optionally,  you  may  specify the keyword <u>blockbits</u>.  This option will locate and print the block
              containing the bitmap corresponding to the specified block.

              Optionally, you may specify the keyword <u>blockrg</u>.  This option will  locate  and  print  the  block
              number of the resource group that holds information about the specified block.

              You  may  also  use  gfs2_edit  to find the next occurrence of a metadata block of a certain type.
              Valid metadata types are: <u>none</u> (unused  metadata  clump  block),  <u>sb</u>  (superblock),  <u>rg</u>  (resource
              group), <u>rb</u> (rg bitmap), <u>di</u> (disk inode aka dinode), <u>in</u> (indirect block list), <u>lf</u> (directory leaf),
              <u>jd</u>  (journaled  data),  <u>lh</u>  (journal  log  header),  <u>ld</u>  (journal  log  descriptor),  <u>ea</u> (extended
              attribute), <u>ed</u> (ea data block), <u>lb</u> (log buffer), <u>13</u> (unused block type  13),  <u>qc</u>  (quota  change).
              The  block  AFTER the one specified with -p is the starting point for the search.  For example, if
              you specify <b>gfs2_edit</b> <b>-p</b> <b>rg</b> <b>12</b> <b>find</b> <b>rg</b> <b>/dev/your/device</b>, it will find the rg that  follows  rg  12
              (normally,  this  would  be  rg  13).   Note,  however,  that  since metadata often appears in the
              journals, it could be a copy of a different RG, inside a journal.  Also note that  gfs2_edit  will
              only  find  <b>allocated</b>  metadata  blocks unless the type specified is none, sb, rg or rb.  In other
              words, if you try to find a disk inode, it will only find an allocated dinode, not  a  deallocated
              one.

              Optionally, you may specify the keyword <u>field</u> followed by a valid metadata field name.  Right now,
              only  the  fields  in disk inodes and resource groups are allowed.  If no value is specified after
              the field, the value of the field will be printed to stdout.  If a value is specified, the field's
              value will be changed.  This may be used, for example, to artificially change  the  di_size  field
              for an inode in order to test fsck.gfs2's ability to detect and fix the problem.

       <b>-s</b> [<u>structure</u> | <u>block</u>]
              Specify  a  starting  block for interactive mode.  Any of the well-known locations found in the -p
              option may be specified.  If you want to start on a  particular  resource  group,  specify  it  in
              quotes, e.g. -s "rg 3"

       <b>-h,</b> <b>-help,</b> <b>-usage</b>
              Print help information.

       <b>-c</b> [<u>0</u> | <u>1</u>]
              Use  alternate color scheme for interactive mode: 0=normal (dark colors on white background), or 1
              (light colors on black background).

       <b>-V</b>     Print program version information only.

       <b>-x</b>     Print in hex mode.

       <b>-z</b> <b>&lt;0-9&gt;</b>
              Compress metadata with gzip compression level 1 to 9 (default 9). 0 means no compression at all.

       <b>rg</b> <u>&lt;rg&gt;</u> <u>&lt;device&gt;</u>
              Print the contents of Resource Group <u>&lt;rg&gt;</u> on <u>&lt;device&gt;</u>.

              <u>&lt;rg&gt;</u> is a number from 0 to X - 1, where X is the number of RGs.

       <b>rgcount</b> <u>&lt;device&gt;</u>
              Print the number of Resource Groups in the file system on <u>&lt;device&gt;</u>.

       <b>rgflags</b> <u>&lt;rg&gt;</u> [<u>new_value</u>] <u>&lt;device&gt;</u>
              Print and/or modify the rg_flags value of Resource Group <u>&lt;rg&gt;</u> on <u>&lt;device&gt;</u>.

              <u>&lt;rg&gt;</u> is a number from 0 to X - 1, where X is the number of RGs.  If <u>new_value</u>  is  not  specified,
              the  current  rg_flags  value  will  be  printed but not modified.  If <u>new_value</u> is specified, the
              rg_flags field will be overwritten with the new value.

       <b>printsavedmeta</b> <u>&lt;filename.gz&gt;</u>
              Print off a list of blocks from &lt;filename.gz&gt; that were saved with the savemeta option.

       <b>savemeta</b> <u>&lt;device&gt;</u> <u>&lt;filename.gz&gt;</u>
              Save off the GFS2 metadata (not user data) for the file system on the specified device to  a  file
              given  by  &lt;filename&gt;.   You can use this option to analyze file system problems without revealing
              sensitive information that may be contained in the files.  This option works quickly by using  the
              system  bitmap  blocks  in  the resource groups to determine the location of all the metadata.  If
              there is corruption in the bitmaps, resource groups or rindex file, this method may fail  and  you
              may  need to use the savemetaslow option.  The destination file is compressed using gzip unless -z
              0 is specified.

       <b>savemetaslow</b> <u>&lt;device&gt;</u> <u>&lt;filename.gz&gt;</u>
              Save off GFS2 metadata, as with the savemeta option, examining every block in the file system  for
              metadata.   This  option  is less prone to failure due to file system corruption than the savemeta
              option, but it is extremely slow.  The destination file is compressed using gzip unless  -z  0  is
              specified.

       <b>savergs</b> <u>&lt;device&gt;</u> <u>&lt;filename.gz&gt;</u>
              Save  off  only  the GFS2 resource group metadata for the file system on the specified device to a
              file given by &lt;filename&gt;.  The destination file is compressed using gzip unless -z 0 is specified.

       <b>restoremeta</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u> <u>&lt;dest</u> <u>device&gt;</u>
              Take a compressed or uncompressed file created with the savemeta option and restores its  contents
              on  top  of  the specified destination device.  <b>WARNING</b>: When you use this option, the file system
              and all data on the destination device is  destroyed.   Since  only  metadata  (but  no  data)  is
              restored,  every  file  in the resulting file system is likely to be corrupt.  The ONLY purpose of
              this option is to examine and debug file system problems by restoring and examining the  state  of
              the  saved  metadata.   If  the destination file system is the same size or larger than the source
              file system where the metadata was saved, the resulting file system will be the same size  as  the
              source.   If the destination device is smaller than the source file system, gfs2_edit will restore
              as much as it can, then quit, leaving you with a file system that probably  will  not  mount,  but
              from which you might still be able to figure out what is wrong with the source file system.

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       If you specify a device on the gfs2_edit command line and you specify no options other than -c, gfs2_edit
       will  act  as  an  interactive  GFS2 file system editor for the file system you specify.  There are three
       display modes: hex mode, structure mode and pointers mode.  You use the  m  key  to  switch  between  the
       modes, as described below.  The modes are as follows:

       Hex mode (default)
              Display or edit blocks of the file system in hexadecimal and ascii.

              Lines  at  the  top  indicate the currently displayed block in both hex and decimal.  If the block
              contains a GFS2 data structure, the name of that structure will appear in the upper  right  corner
              of  the display.  If the block is a well-known block, such as the superblock or rindex, there will
              be a line to indicate what it is.

              In hex mode, you can edit blocks by pressing <b>&lt;enter&gt;</b> and entering hexadecimal  digits  to  replace
              the  highlighted  hex  digits.  Do NOT precede the numbers with "0x".  For example, if you want to
              change the value at offset 0x60 from a 0x12 to 0xef, position your cursor to offset 0x60, so  that
              the  12  is  highlighted,  then press <b>&lt;enter&gt;</b> and type in "ef".  Press <b>&lt;escape&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;enter&gt;</b> to exit
              edit mode.

              In hex mode, different colors indicate different  things.   For  example,  in  the  default  color
              scheme,  the  GFS2  data structure will be black, data offsets will be light blue, and actual data
              (anything after the gfs2 data structure) will be red.

       Structure mode
              Decode the file system block into its GFS2 structure and display the  values  of  that  structure.
              This  mode  is most useful for jumping around the file system.  For example, you can use the arrow
              keys to position down to a pointer and press <b>J</b> to jump to that block.

       Pointers mode
              Display any additional information appearing on the block.  For example, if  an  inode  has  block
              pointers,  this  will display them and allow you to scroll through them.  You can also position to
              one of them and press <b>J</b> to jump to that block.

</pre><h4><b>Interactive</b> <b>mode</b> <b>command</b> <b>keys:</b></h4><pre>
       <b>q</b> or <b>&lt;esc&gt;</b>
              The <b>q</b> or <b>&lt;escape&gt;</b> keys are used to exit gfs2_edit.

       <b>&lt;arrow/movement</b> <b>keys&gt;</b> up, down, right, left, pg-up, pg-down, home, end
              The arrow keys are used to highlight an area of the display.  The <b>J</b> key may be used to jump to the
              block that is highlighted.

       <b>m</b> - Mode switch
              The <b>m</b> key is used to switch between the three display  modes.   The  initial  mode  is  hex  mode.
              Pressing  the  <b>m</b>  key  once  switches  to structure mode.  Pressing it a second time switches from
              structure mode to pointers mode.  Pressing it a third time takes you back to hex mode again.

       <b>j</b> - Jump to block
              The <b>j</b> key jumps to the block number that is currently highlighted.  In hex mode,  hitting  J  will
              work when any byte of the pointer is highlighted.

       <b>g</b> - Goto block
              The  <b>g</b> key asks for a block number, then jumps there.  Note that in many cases, you can also arrow
              up so that the current block number is highlighted, then press <b>&lt;enter&gt;</b> to enter a block number  to
              jump to.

       <b>h</b> - Help display
              The <b>h</b> key causes the interactive help display to be shown.

       <b>e</b> - Extended mode
              The <b>e</b> key causes gfs2_edit to switch to extended ("pointers") mode.

       <b>c</b> - Color scheme
              The <b>c</b> key causes gfs2_edit to switch to its alternate color scheme.

       <b>f</b> - Forward block
              The  <b>f</b>  key  causes  you to scroll forward one block.  This does not affect the "jump" status.  In
              other words, if you use the <b>f</b> key to move forward several blocks, pressing  <b>&lt;backspace&gt;</b>  will  not
              roll you back up.

       <b>&lt;enter&gt;</b> - Edit value
              The  <b>&lt;enter&gt;</b>  key causes you to go from display mode to edit mode.  If you are in hex mode and you
              hit enter, you can type new hex values at the cursor's current location.  Note:  pressing  <b>&lt;enter&gt;</b>
              in structure mode allows you to enter a new value, with the following restrictions:  For gfs2 disk
              inodes  and resource groups, it will actually change the value on disk. However, inode numbers may
              not be changed.  For all other structures, the values entered are ignored.

              If you use the up arrow key to highlight the block number, then press <b>&lt;enter&gt;</b>, you may then  enter
              a  new block number, or any of the well-known block locations listed above (e.g. sb, rindex, inum,
              rg 17, etc.) and gfs2_edit will jump to the block specified.  If you  specify  a  slash  character
              followed  by a metadata type, gfs2_edit will search for the next occurrence of that metadata block
              type, and jump there.  It will take you to block 0 if it does not find  any  more  blocks  of  the
              specified metadata type.

       <b>&lt;home&gt;</b> If  you  are  in pointers mode, this takes you back to the starts of the pointers you are viewing.
              Otherwise it takes you back to the superblock.

       <b>&lt;backspace&gt;</b>
              This takes you back to the block you were displaying before a jump.

       <b>&lt;space&gt;</b>
              This takes you forward to the block you were displaying when you hit <b>&lt;backspace&gt;</b>.
