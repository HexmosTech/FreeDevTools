       winregfs - Windows registry FUSE filesystem

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mount.winregfs</b> <b>[</b><u>fuse_options</u><b>[,...]]</b>  <u>hivefile</u> <u>mountpoint</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>winregfs</b>  is  a  FUSE-based  filesystem  driver  that enables accessing of Windows registry hive files as
       ordinary filesystems. Registry hive file editing  can  be  performed  with  ordinary  shell  scripts  and
       command-line tools once mounted.

       Registry  values  are  shown  as files with a file extension corresponding to the data type of the value.
       These are generally named after the REG_* types seen in the Windows registry editor. For example, <b>dw</b> is a
       DWORD, <b>sz</b> is a string, <b>esz</b> is an expanding string, <b>bin</b> is a raw binary value, and  <b>msz</b>  is  a  multi-line
       string. Types different from the "standard" types may appear in rare instances.

       Because registry keys and values can have forward slashes in their names, there is a special word <b>_SLASH_</b>
       that is used in place of any real slashes and is converted back-and-forth automatically.

       Opening  a  value's  name  without the extension is supported, but you should always use the extension if
       possible to avoid ambiguity issues.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>winregfs</b> does not currently support writing value data greater than 8,192 bytes (8 KiB) in size. If  such
       a  write  occurs, the data will be truncated and an error will be returned. Unicode data is not currently
       supported, partly due to a lack of support in the ntreg library.

       Incorrect or unrecognized structures in a registry file may cause  this  program  to  crash.  It  is  not
       recommended for use on important data and while most operations generally work as expected, you use it at
       your own risk. Please report any bugs you encounter.

       <b>winregfs</b>  loads  the  entire hive file into one large chunk of memory.  This is a side effect of adopting
       the low-level registry library from the program <b>chntpw</b>. There is a silent delay as the hive is loaded and
       if the file is large enough there is a  chance  of  failure  due  to  being  unable  to  allocate  enough
       contiguous  memory.  Changing  this  behavior is a very difficult task due to how the ntreg library works
       with the data.
