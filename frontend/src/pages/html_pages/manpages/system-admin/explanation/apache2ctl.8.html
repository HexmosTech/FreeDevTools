</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       apache2ctl - Apache HTTP server control interface

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       When acting in SysV init mode, apache2ctl takes simple, one-word commands, defined below.

       <b>apachectl</b> <u>command</u>

       <b>apache2ctl</b> <u>command</u>

       When acting in pass-through mode, apache2ctl can take all the arguments available for the httpd binary.

       <b>apachectl</b> [<u>httpd-argument</u>]

       <b>apache2ctl</b> [<u>httpd-argument</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apache2ctl</b>  is  a  front  end to the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server.  It is designed to
       help the administrator control the functioning of the Apache <b>apache2</b> daemon.

       <b>NOTE:</b>  The  default  Debian   configuration   requires   the   environment   variables   <b>APACHE_RUN_USER</b>,
       <b>APACHE_RUN_GROUP</b>, and <b>APACHE_PID_FILE</b> to be set in <b>/etc/apache2/envvars</b>.

       The  <b>apache2ctl</b>  script  returns a 0 exit value on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.  For more details,
       view the comments in the script.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>command</u> can be any one or more of the following options:

       <b>start</b>         Start the Apache daemon.  Gives an error if it is already running.

       <b>stop</b>          Stops the Apache daemon.

       <b>restart</b>       Restarts the Apache daemon by sending it a SIGHUP.  If the daemon is  not  running,  it  is
                     started.   This  command automatically checks the configuration files via <b>configtest</b> before
                     initiating the restart to to catch  the   most  obvious   errors.   However,  it  is  still
                     possible for the daemon to die because of problems with the configuration.

       <b>fullstatus</b>    Displays  a  full  status  report  from  <b>mod_status.</b>   For  this  to work, you need to have
                     mod_status enabled on your server and a text-based browser such as <u>lynx</u> available  on  your
                     system.    The   URL  used  to  access  the  status  report  can  be  set  by  setting  the
                     <b>APACHE_STATUSURL</b> variable in <b>/etc/apache2/envvars</b>.

       <b>status</b>        Displays a brief status report. Similar to the fullstatus option, except that the  list  of
                     requests currently being served is omitted.

       <b>graceful</b>      Gracefully  restarts  the  Apache  daemon  by  sending  it a SIGUSR1.  If the daemon is not
                     running, it is started.  This  differs  from  a  normal  restart  in  that  currently  open
                     connections  are  not  aborted.   A  side  effect  is that old log files will not be closed
                     immediately.  This means that if used in a log rotation script, a substantial delay may  be
                     necessary to ensure that the old log files are closed before processing them.  This command
                     automatically  checks  the  configuration files via apache2ctl configtest before initiating
                     the restart to to catch the most obvious errors.  However, it is  still  possible  for  the
                     daemon to die because of problems with the configuration.

       <b>graceful-stop</b> Gracefully  stops  the  Apache  httpd  daemon.   This  differs  from  a normal stop in that
                     currently open connections are not aborted.  A side effect is that old log files  will  not
                     be closed immediately.

       <b>configtest</b>    Run  a configuration file syntax test. It parses the configuration files and either reports
                     <b>Syntax</b> <b>Ok</b> or information about the particular syntax error. This test does  not  catch  all
                     errors.

       <b>help</b>          Displays a short help message.

       The following option was available in earlier versions but has been removed.

       <b>startssl</b>      To  start  httpd  with  SSL support, you should edit your configuration file to include the
                     relevant directives and then use the normal apache2ctl start.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  behaviour  of  <b>apache2ctl</b>  can  be  influenced  with  these  environment  variables:   <b>APACHE_HTTPD</b>,
       <b>APACHE_LYNX</b>, <b>APACHE_STATUSURL</b>, <b>APACHE_ULIMIT_MAX_FILES</b>, <b>APACHE_RUN_DIR</b>, <b>APACHE_LOCK_DIR</b>, <b>APACHE_RUN_USER</b>,
       <b>APACHE_ARGUMENTS</b>,  <b>APACHE_ENVVARS</b>.   See the comments in the script for details.  These variables (except
       <b>APACHE_ENVVARS</b>) can be set in <b>/etc/apache2/envvars</b>.
