</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tigexp - UNIX Security Checker Explanation Generator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tigexp</b> <u>msgid</u> [<u>msgid</u>[<u>msgid</u>...]]

       <b>tigexp</b> [<b>-f</b>|<b>-F</b>] [<u>security_report</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tigexp</b>  is  used to generate explanations of the output from the <b>Tiger</b> security checking package.  In the
       first form, <b>tigexp</b> will generate an explanation of each of the message ids listed.  In the  second  form,
       the  security  report  specified will be scanned and explanations generated.  The <b>-f</b> option will generate
       one explanation for each unique message id in the security report, whereas the <b>-F</b> option will output  the
       security report with explanations inserted after each entry in the report.

       There  are five different message levels produced by <b>Tiger</b>. Each of the message levels is the last letter
       of the message id. The levels are:

       <u>ALERT</u>  A message of this level indicates  that  <b>Tiger</b>  has  detected  a  possible  intrusion  attempt  or
              troublesome misconfiguration which can expose the whole system to attacks.

       <u>FAIL</u>   Messages  of this level indicate a violation of a generic security policy or a possible intrusion.
              Appropriate action should be taken to fix this security issue.

       <u>WARN</u>   Messages of this level indicate a security  issue  which  should  be  checked  further  and  might
              indicate a probable vulnerability or exposure. Most <b>Tiger</b> messages appear in this category.

       <u>INFO</u>   These  includes  information  messages which are not necessarily a security violation but might be
              useful  for  the  administrator.  Note  that  the   <u>tigerrc</u>   configuration   file   through   the
              <u>Tiger_Show_INFO_Msgs</u>  option  determines  whether  or  not  <b>Tiger</b>  shows  these items. The default
              behaviour is to <u>not</u> show them.

       <u>ERROR</u>  These messages are errors in the execution of <b>Tiger</b> (or any of its scripts), this is probably  due
              to  a  misconfiguration in the program, because of a problem in the installation or because a file
              needed for the test is missing. The script who outputs this error should be investigated further.

       <u>CONFIG</u> Messages with this level inform of stages in the configuration process  of  <b>Tiger</b>.  They  are  not
              errors  (otherwise  <u>ERROR</u>  would be used) but notices for the user running the program explaining,
              for example, which configuration might be used.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-f</b>     Scan the indicated security report and generate explanations  of  it.   One  explanation  will  be
              generated  for each unique message id in the security report.  If the name of a security report is
              not given, then the report is read from stdin.

       <b>-F</b>     Output the indicated security report with explanations inserted after each entry  in  the  report.
              If the name of a security report is not given, then the report is read from stdin.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If the explanation index is out of date, it doesn't recognize it and generates junk.
