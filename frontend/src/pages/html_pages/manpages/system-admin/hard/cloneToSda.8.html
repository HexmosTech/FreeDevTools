       cloneToSda - clone the Freeduc system from a live session to the machine's hard disk

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>cloneToSda</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cloneToSda</b> allows one to clone the core of a live Freeduc system to the local machine's hard disk. All
       data on the hard disk will be erased, four partitions will be created on the hard disk

       /dev/sda1
           The first partition (which weighs some gigabytes) contains a bootable iso-9660 filesystem, so the
           core of Freeduc is in read-only mode.

       /dev/sda2
           The second partition is a hidden NTFS partition, inside the iso-9660 partition, to feature iso-hybrid
           boot properties. This partition contains necessary files to boot in EFI mode.

       /dev/sda3
           A vestigial vfat partition. For pluggable disks, it does make sense to provide a vfat partition,
           which can contain files reachable from Windows and Mac machines. When the same system is used on a
           hard drive, allocating disk resource to this partition does not make sense.

       /dev/sda4
           This partition bears a EXT4 filesystem. It is called the "persistence" partition, and some of its
           directories are mounted in overlay mode: that means that every changes to the original system are
           written there.

           If one erases the directory rw/ near the root of this partition, all persistence data are removed.
           One important file must be kept in its root directory: "persistence.conf" defines how overlays are
           mounted. By default, this file defines one single overlay for all the system.
