</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mkfs.fat - create an MS-DOS FAT filesystem

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mkfs.fat</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>DEVICE</u> [<u>BLOCK-COUNT</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mkfs.fat</b>  is used to create a FAT filesystem on a device or in an image file.  <u>DEVICE</u> is the special file
       corresponding to the device (e.g. /dev/sdXX) or the image file (which does not need  to  exist  when  the
       option  <b>-C</b>  is given).  <u>BLOCK-COUNT</u> is the number of blocks on the device and size of one block is always
       1024 bytes, independently of the sector size or the cluster size.  Therefore <u>BLOCK-COUNT</u>  specifies  size
       of  filesystem  in  KiB  unit and not in the number of sectors (like for all other <b>mkfs.fat</b> options).  If
       omitted, <b>mkfs.fat</b> automatically chooses a filesystem size to fill the available space.

       Two different variants of the FAT filesystem are supported.  Standard  is  the  FAT12,  FAT16  and  FAT32
       filesystems as defined by Microsoft and widely used on hard disks and removable media like USB sticks and
       SD cards.  The other is the legacy Atari variant used on Atari ST.

       In  Atari  mode,  if  not directed otherwise by the user, <b>mkfs.fat</b> will always use 2 sectors per cluster,
       since GEMDOS doesn't like other values very much.  It will also obey the maximum number of sectors GEMDOS
       can handle.  Larger filesystems are managed by raising the  logical  sector  size.   An  Atari-compatible
       serial  number  for  the filesystem is generated, and a 12 bit FAT is used only for filesystems that have
       one of the usual floppy sizes (720k, 1.2M, 1.44M, 2.88M), a 16 bit FAT otherwise.  This can be overridden
       with the <b>-F</b> option.  Some PC-specific boot sector fields aren't written, and a boot message  (option  <b>-m</b>)
       is ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>  Normally,  for  any filesystem except very small ones, <b>mkfs.fat</b> will align all the data structures to
           cluster size, to make sure that as long as the partition is properly aligned, so will  all  the  data
           structures  in  the  filesystem.   This  option  disables  alignment;  this  may provide a handful of
           additional clusters of storage at the expense of a  significant  performance  degradation  on  RAIDs,
           flash media or large-sector hard disks.

       <b>-A</b>  Select using the Atari variation of the FAT filesystem if that isn't active already, otherwise select
           standard FAT filesystem.  This is selected by default if <b>mkfs.fat</b> is run on 68k Atari Linux.

       <b>-b</b> <u>SECTOR-OF-BACKUP</u>
           Selects  the  location  of  the  backup boot sector for FAT32.  Default depends on number of reserved
           sectors, but usually is sector 6.  If there is a free space available after the  backup  boot  sector
           then  backup  of the FAT32 info sector is put after the backup boot sector, usually at sector 7.  The
           backup must be within the range of reserved sectors.  Value 0 completely disables creating of  backup
           boot and info FAT32 sectors.

       <b>-c</b>  Check the device for bad blocks before creating the filesystem.

       <b>-C</b>  Create  the  file  given as <u>DEVICE</u> on the command line, and write the to-be-created filesystem to it.
           This can be used to create the new filesystem in a file instead of on a real  device,  and  to  avoid
           using  <b>dd</b> in advance to create a file of appropriate size.  With this option, the <u>BLOCK-COUNT</u> must be
           given, because otherwise the intended size of the filesystem wouldn't be known.  The file created  is
           a  sparse  file,  which  actually  only  contains  the  meta-data  areas (boot sector, FATs, and root
           directory).  The data portions won't be stored on the disk, but the file nevertheless will  have  the
           correct  size.   The  resulting file can be copied later to a floppy disk or other device, or mounted
           through a loop device.

       <b>-D</b> <u>DRIVE-NUMBER</u>
           Specify the BIOS drive number to be stored in the FAT boot sector.   For  hard  disks  and  removable
           medias  it  is  usually 0x80–0xFF (0x80 is first hard disk C:, 0x81 is second hard disk D:, ...), for
           floppy devices or partitions to be used for floppy emulation it is 0x00–0x7F (0x00  is  first  floppy
           A:, 0x01 is second floppy B:).

       <b>-f</b> <u>NUMBER-OF-FATS</u>
           Specify the number of file allocation tables in the filesystem.  The default is 2.

       <b>-F</b> <u>FAT-SIZE</u>
           Specifies  the  type  of  file  allocation  tables used (12, 16 or 32 bit).  If nothing is specified,
           <b>mkfs.fat</b> will automatically select between 12, 16 and 32 bit, whatever fits better for the filesystem
           size.

       <b>-g</b> <u>HEADS</u>/<u>SECTORS-PER-TRACK</u>
           Specify <u>HEADS</u> and <u>SECTORS-PER-TRACK</u> numbers which represents disk geometry of <u>DEVICE</u>.   Both  numbers
           are  stored  into  the FAT boot sector.  Number <u>SECTORS-PER-TRACK</u> is used also for aligning the total
           count of FAT sectors.  By default disk geometry is read from <u>DEVICE</u> itself.  If it is  not  available
           then  <u>LBA-Assist</u>  <u>Translation</u> and translation table from the <u>SD</u> <u>Card</u> <u>Part</u> <u>2</u> <u>File</u> <u>System</u> <u>Specification</u>
           based on total number of disk sectors is used.

       <b>-h</b> <u>NUMBER-OF-HIDDEN-SECTORS</u>
           Specify the number of so-called <u>hidden</u> <u>sectors</u>, as  stored  in  the  FAT  boot  sector:  this  number
           represents  the  beginning  sector  of the partition containing the file system.  Normally this is an
           offset (in sectors) relative to the start of the disk, although for MBR logical volumes contained  in
           an  extended  partition  of  type  0x05  (a  non-LBA  extended  partition),  a  quirk  in  the MS-DOS
           implementation of FAT requires it to be relative to the  partition's  immediate  containing  Extended
           Boot Record.  Boot code and other software handling FAT volumes may also rely on this field being set
           up  correctly;  most  modern  FAT  implementations  will  ignore  it.  By default, if the <u>DEVICE</u> is a
           partition block device, <b>mkfs.fat</b> uses the  partition  offset  relative  to  disk  start.   Otherwise,
           <b>mkfs.fat</b> assumes zero.  Use this option to override this behaviour.

       <b>-i</b> <u>VOLUME-ID</u>
           Sets  the  volume  ID  of the newly created filesystem; <u>VOLUME-ID</u> is a 32-bit hexadecimal number (for
           example, 2e24ec82).  The default is a number which depends on the filesystem creation time.

       <b>-I</b>  Ignore and disable safety checks.  By default <b>mkfs.fat</b> refuses to create a  filesystem  on  a  device
           with  partitions  or  virtual  mapping.  <b>mkfs.fat</b> will complain and tell you that it refuses to work.
           This is different when using MO disks.   One  doesn't  always  need  partitions  on  MO  disks.   The
           filesystem  can  go  directly  to  the whole disk.  Under other OSes this is known as the <u>superfloppy</u>
           format.  This switch will force <b>mkfs.fat</b> to work properly.

       <b>-l</b> <u>FILENAME</u>
           Read the bad blocks list from <u>FILENAME</u>.

       <b>-m</b> <u>MESSAGE-FILE</u>
           Sets the message the user receives on attempts  to  boot  this  filesystem  without  having  properly
           installed  an operating system.  The message file must not exceed 418 bytes once line feeds have been
           converted to carriage return-line feed combinations, and tabs have been expanded.  If the filename is
           a hyphen (-), the text is taken from standard input.

       <b>-M</b> <u>FAT-MEDIA-TYPE</u>
           Specify the media type to be stored in the FAT boot sector.  This value  is  usually  0xF8  for  hard
           disks  and  is  0xF0  or  a  value from 0xF9 to 0xFF for floppies or partitions to be used for floppy
           emulation.

       <b>--mbr</b>[=<u>y</u>|<u>yes</u>|<u>n</u>|<u>no</u>|<u>a</u>|<u>auto</u>]
           Fill (fake) MBR table with disk signature one partition  which  starts  at  sector  0  (includes  MBR
           itself)  and  spans  whole  disk device.  It is needed only for non-removable disks used on Microsoft
           Windows systems and only when formatting whole unpartitioned disk.  Location of  the  disk  signature
           and  partition  table  overlaps  with the end of the first FAT sector (boot code location), therefore
           there is no additional space usage.  Default is <u>auto</u> mode in which <b>mkfs.fat</b> put MBR  table  only  for
           non-removable disks when formatting whole unpartitioned disk.

       <b>-n</b> <u>VOLUME-NAME</u>
           Sets  the  volume  name  (label) of the filesystem.  The volume name can be up to 11 characters long.
           Supplying an empty string, a string consisting only of white space or the string "NO NAME" as <u>VOLUME-</u>
           <u>NAME</u> has the same effect as not giving the <b>-n</b> option.  The default is no label.

       <b>--codepage</b>=<u>PAGE</u>
           Use DOS codepage <u>PAGE</u> to encode label.  By default codepage 850 is used.

       <b>-r</b> <u>ROOT-DIR-ENTRIES</u>
           Select the minimal number of entries available in the root directory.  The default is 112 or 224  for
           floppies  and  512  for  hard  disks.   Note  that  this is minimal number and it may be increased by
           <b>mkfs.fat</b> due to alignment of structures.  See also <b>mkfs.fat</b> option <b>-a</b>.

       <b>-R</b> <u>NUMBER-OF-RESERVED-SECTORS</u>
           Select the minimal number of reserved sectors.  With FAT32 format at least  2  reserved  sectors  are
           needed,  the  default  is  32.  Otherwise the default is 1 (only the boot sector).  Note that this is
           minimal number and it may be increased by <b>mkfs.fat</b> due to alignment of structures.  See also <b>mkfs.fat</b>
           option <b>-a</b>.

       <b>-s</b> <u>SECTORS-PER-CLUSTER</u>
           Specify the number of disk sectors per cluster.  Must be a power of 2, i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8, ... 128.

       <b>-S</b> <u>LOGICAL-SECTOR-SIZE</u>
           Specify the number of bytes per logical sector.  Must be a power of 2 and greater than  or  equal  to
           512,  i.e.  512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, or 32768.  Values larger than 4096 are not conforming
           to the FAT file system specification and may not work everywhere.

       <b>-v</b>  Verbose execution.

       <b>--offset</b> <u>SECTOR</u>
           Write the filesystem at a specific sector into the device  file.   This  is  useful  for  creating  a
           filesystem in a partitioned disk image without having to set up a loop device.

       <b>--variant</b> <u>TYPE</u>
           Create a filesystem of variant <u>TYPE</u>.  Acceptable values are <u>standard</u> and <u>atari</u> (in any combination of
           upper/lower case).  See above under DESCRIPTION for the differences.

       <b>--help</b>
           Display option summary and exit.

       <b>--invariant</b>
           Use constants for normally randomly generated or time based data such as volume ID and creation time.
           Multiple  runs  of  <b>mkfs.fat</b>  on the same device create identical results with this option.  Its main
           purpose is testing <b>mkfs.fat</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mkfs.fat</b> can not create boot-able filesystems.  This isn't as easy as you might think at first glance for
       various reasons and has been discussed a lot already.  <b>mkfs.fat</b> simply will not support it ;)
