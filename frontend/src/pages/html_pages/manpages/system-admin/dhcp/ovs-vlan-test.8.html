       ovs-vlan-test - Check Linux drivers for problems with vlan traffic

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ovs-vlan-test</b> [<b>-s</b> | <b>–server</b>] <u>control_ip</u> <u>vlan_ip</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ovs-vlan-test</b>  utility  has some limitations, for example, it does not use TCP in its tests. Also it
       does not take into account MTU to detect potential edge cases. To overcome those limitations a  new  tool
       was developed - <b>ovs-test</b>. <b>ovs-test</b> is currently supported only on Debian so, if possible, try to use that
       on instead of <b>ovs-vlan-test</b>.

       The  <b>ovs-vlan-test</b>  program may be used to check for problems sending 802.1Q traffic which may occur when
       running Open vSwitch. These problems can occur when Open vSwitch is used to send 802.1Q  traffic  through
       physical  interfaces  running  certain drivers of certain Linux kernel versions. To run a test, configure
       Open vSwitch to tag traffic originating from <u>vlan_ip</u> and forward it out the target  interface.  Then  run
       the  <b>ovs-vlan-test</b> in client mode connecting to an <b>ovs-vlan-test</b> server.  <b>ovs-vlan-test</b> will display “OK”
       if it did not detect problems.

       Some examples of the types of problems that may be encountered are:

       • When NICs use VLAN stripping on receive they must pass a pointer to a  <u>vlan_group</u>  when  reporting  the
         stripped  tag  to  the  networking  core.  If  no  <u>vlan_group</u> is in use then some drivers just drop the
         extracted tag.  Drivers are supposed to only enable stripping if a <u>vlan_group</u> is registered but not all
         of them do that.

       • On receive, some drivers handle priority tagged packets specially and  don’t  pass  the  tag  onto  the
         network stack at all, so Open vSwitch never has a chance to see it.

       • Some  drivers  size  their  receive  buffers  based  on whether a <u>vlan_group</u> is enabled, meaning that a
         maximum size packet with a VLAN tag will not fit if no <u>vlan_group</u> is configured.

       • On transmit, some drivers expect that VLAN acceleration will be used if it is available, which can only
         be done if a <u>vlan_group</u> is configured. In these cases, the driver may fail  to  parse  the  packet  and
         correctly setup checksum offloading or TSO.

       <b>Client</b> <b>Mode</b>
              An  <b>ovs-vlan-test</b>  client may be run on a host to check for VLAN connectivity problems. The client
              must be able to establish HTTP connections with an <b>ovs-vlan-test</b> server located at  the  specified
              <u>control_ip</u> address. UDP traffic sourced at <u>vlan_ip</u> should be tagged and directed out the interface
              whose connectivity is being tested.

       <b>Server</b> <b>Mode</b>
              To  conduct  tests,  an  <b>ovs-vlan-test</b>  server  must  be  running on a host known not to have VLAN
              connectivity problems. The server must have a <u>control_ip</u> on a non-VLAN network which  clients  can
              establish  connectivity  with. It must also have a <u>vlan_ip</u> address on a VLAN network which clients
              will use to test their VLAN connectivity. Multiple clients may test against a single <b>ovs-vlan-test</b>
              server concurrently.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-s,</b> <b>--server</b>
              Run in server mode.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information to the console.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Display the Linux kernel version and driver of <u>eth1</u>:

          uname -r
          ethtool -i eth1

       Set up a bridge which forwards traffic originating from <u>1.2.3.4</u> out <u>eth1</u> with VLAN tag 10:

          ovs-vsctl -- add-br vlan-br \
            -- add-port vlan-br eth1 \
            -- add-port vlan-br vlan-br-tag tag=10 \
            -- set Interface vlan-br-tag type=internal
          ip addr add 1.2.3.4/8 dev vlan-br-tag
          ip link set vlan-br-tag up

       Run an <b>ovs-vlan-test</b> server listening for client control traffic  on  <u>172.16.0.142</u>  port  <u>8080</u>  and  VLAN
       traffic on the default port of <u>1.2.3.3</u>:

          ovs-vlan-test -s 172.16.0.142:8080 1.2.3.3

       Run  an  <b>ovs-vlan-test</b> client with a control server located at <u>172.16.0.142</u> port <u>8080</u> and a local VLAN IP
       of <u>1.2.3.4</u>:

          ovs-vlan-test 172.16.0.142:8080 1.2.3.4
