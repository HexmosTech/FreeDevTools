</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mod_gridsite</b> - Grid extensions to Apache httpd

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>LoadModule</b> <b>gridsite_module</b> <b>mod_gridsite.so</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mod_gridsite</b>  is  an  Apache  2.0 module which enforces access control via Grid Access Control Lists, and
       X.509, GSI or VOMS credentials. mod_gridsite also gives Apache built-in support  for  the  HTTP  PUT  and
       DELETE methods, and formatting of HTML pages with standard headers and footers.

       Since  mod_gridsite  access  control within Apache itself, Grid authorization and the associated verified
       credentials are available to all technologies supported by Apache, including static  file  serving,  SSI,
       CGI, PHP, mod_perl and Java servlets via a connector to Tomcat.

       Operation  of  mod_gridsite  can  be  configured using runtime directives in Apache's standard httpd.conf
       configuration file. The module must first be loaded with a LoadModule directive:

       LoadModule gridsite_module /PATH/TO/MODULES/mod_gridsite.so

       The module's behaviour is then  controlled  by  GridSite...  directives  within  Apache  &lt;Directory  ...&gt;
       sections, allowing different directories to use GridSite features in different ways.

</pre><h4><b>DIRECTIVES</b></h4><pre>
       GridSiteIndexes on|off
              Determines  whether  GridSite  generates  HTML directory listings. These have some advantages over
              standard Apache directory listings (eg the displayed  filenames  are  never  truncated)  and  will
              include standard headers and footers if GridSiteHtmlFormat is on.  (Default: GridSiteIndexes off)

       GridSiteIndexHeader file
              If the named file is found in the directory being listed, the file is included verbatim at the top
              of  the  listing  and excluded from the file-by-file listing. The file can either be HTML or plain
              text (in which case browsers will be treat it as one HTML paragraph.)  (Default: none)

       GridSiteHtmlFormat on|off
              Determines where HTML pages receive additional formatting before being sent to  the  client.  This
              includes  the  "Last  modified", "View page history", "Switch to HTTP(S)", "Print View" and "Built
              with GridSite" footer elements. If header and footer files are  found,  they  will  be  used  too.
              (Default: GridSiteHtmlFormat off)

       GridSiteHeadFile file

       GridSiteFootFile file
              Set  the filenames to be used for as standard headers and footers for HTML pages. If the file name
              begins with "/" then this is used as the absolute path to that file to  be  used.  Otherwise,  for
              each  HTML  page,  the  directory  of  that  page  is  tried first, and then parent directories in
              ascending order until a header / footer file is found. Header files are inserted in place of  HTML
              &lt;body[ ...]&gt; tags; footer files in place of &lt;/body&gt;. (These standard files should each include the
              appropriate   body   tag   as   a  replacement.)   (Defaults:  GridSiteHeadFile  gridsitehead.txt,
              GridSiteFootFile gridsitefoot.txt)

       GridSiteAuth on|off
              Enables GridSite access control features, using GACL files. The files are named .gacl and are per-
              directory. The current directory is tried and then parent directories in ascending order  until  a
              .gacl file is found.  (Default: GridSiteAuth off)

       GridSiteAutoPasscode on|off
              Whether  to  automatically  issue  passcodes in response to HTTPS requests made using a full X.509
              certificate (not a GSI proxy.)  (Default: GridSiteAutoPasscode on)

       GridSiteRequirePasscode on|off
              Whether to require passcode cookies when  processing  HTTPS  requests  made  using  a  full  X.509
              certificate (not a GSI proxy.)  (Default: GridSiteRequirePasscode off)

       GridSiteZoneSlashes number
              How many slashes to include in passcode paths. The path is the prefix of REQUEST_URI that includes
              that  number of slashes.  Path matching is checked by mod_gridsite in addition to any selection of
              cookies by path made by the browser.  (Default: GridSiteZoneSlashes 1)

       GridSiteAdminList uri
              All members of the DN List with name "uri" receive the full set of  permissions,  irrespective  of
              per-directory  .gacl files. People in this group have full control over the whole site.  (Default:
              none)

       GridSiteGSIProxyLimit limit
              When using GSI Proxy credentials, proxies with delegation  depth  greater  than  "limit"  will  be
              ignored  by  mod_gridsite  authorization  decisions.  A  limit  of  zero  implies  only full X.509
              certificates (and no proxies) will be accepted. A limit of 1 implies that only the initial  proxy,
              usually  created on the user's own machine, is acceptable. Higher levels lead to proxies on remote
              machines, eg used by running jobs, being accepted.  (Default: GridSiteGSIProxyLimit 1)

       GridSiteMethods [GET] [PUT] [DELETE] [MOVE]
              Specifies which HTTP methods are supported by GridSite. GET (and HEAD) are always  supported.  PUT
              and  DELETE  support  is  turned  on by this directive, subject to a positive statement that write
              permission is allowed for the directory in question, by a GACL file.  (Default: GridSite GET)

       GridSiteDNlists directory1[:directory2[:directory3]...]
              Sets up the DN List path used by GACL for evaluating &lt;dn-list&gt; credentials. If this  directive  is
              not  used, then GACL will use the GRST_DN_LISTS variable from Apache's own environment. If that is
              not set either, then /etc/grid-security/dn-lists is searched.  (Default: none)

       GridSiteDNlistsURI uri
              If GridSiteDNlistsURI is used, then the URI given appears to be populated with all the DN lists on
              the current DN lists path which match the current server. That is, for server https://example.org/
              with DN lists URI /dn-lists/, all DN lists with URLs starting  https://example.org/dn-lists/  will
              appear  to be present in /dn-lists/, irrespective of where in the path they are stored.  (Default:
              none) &lt;p&gt;

       GridSiteAdminURI uri
              GridSiteAdminURI gives the absolute URI on the server of the GridSite Admin CGI program, which  is
              used  for  file  management,  HTML  and  GACL editing. This should be used in conjunction with the
              standard Apache directive ScriptAlias to map that URI to the  real-gridsite-admin.cgi  executable.
              For example:

              ScriptAlias /real-gridsite-admin.cgi /PATH/TO/real-gridsite-admin.cgi

              This URI is always reached by an internal redirection from the value set by GridSiteAdminFile, and
              is never visible to users.  (Default: none)

       GridSiteAdminFile cgifilename
              If GridSiteAdminURI is set, then the cgifilename of GridSiteAdminFile appears to be present in all
              directories  when  explicitly  requested  (it does not appear in directory listings.) Requests for
              these ghost CGI URIs are internally redirected to the value  set  by  GridSiteAdminURI.  (Default:
              GridSiteAdminFile gridsite-admin.cgi)

       GridSiteEnvs on|off
              This  makes  mod_gridsite  export several variables into the environment of CGI programs and other
              dynamic content systems. The variable names are listed below. For gridsite-admin.cgi mechanism  to
              work, this switch must be left in its default state of on.  (Default: GridSiteEnvs on)

       GridSiteEditable [ext1 [ext2 [ext3] ...]]]
              A  space-separated  list  of  file extensions which can safely be edited by the GridSite Text/HTML
              editor. The extensions are given without the  initial  dot.  This  directive  must  apply  to  the
              gridsite-admin.cgi  executable,  rather  than  just  to  the files it manages. This is most easily
              achieved by placing GridSiteEditable in  the  main  section  of  the  virtual  host,  outside  any
              Directory or Location containers.  (Default: GridSiteEditable txt shtml html htm css js php jsp)

       GridSiteHelpURI uri
              If set, gives the URI to use for "Website Help" links in HTML page footers. (Default: none)

       GridSiteLoginURI uri
              If  set,  gives  the  URI  prefix  to  use  for  login/logout  links  in  page  footers.  The text
              "Login/Logout" will be a link to the prefix followed by the value of REQUEST_URI for the  page  in
              question. (Default: none)

       GridSiteLink on|off
              Turns  off  the  link  in  the  HTML  page  footers  which  gives  credit  to GridSite.  (Default:
              GridSiteLink on)

       GridSiteUnzip path
              If "path" is set by this directive, then real-gridsite-admin.cgi will offer to list  the  contents
              of  .zip archives on the server.  Users with write access are able to unpack the contents into the
              same directory as the .zip file. The value of &amp;quot;path&amp;quot; must point to the location  of  the
              unzip binary. (Default: none)

       GridSiteGridHTTP on|off
              Enable  GridHTTP for this server, virtual server or directory: HTTPS requests made with the header
              <b>Upgrade:</b> <b>GridHTTP/1.0</b> will be redirected to an HTTP version of the file. (Default: off)

       GridSiteGridHTTPport port
              Sets the port to use for the unencrypted HTTP component of  GridHTTP  HTTPS-&gt;HTTP  transfers.  The
              same setting will be used for all virtual hosts which support GridHTTP. (Default: 777)

       GridSiteSessionsDir path
              Location  of authentication cookies and SSL session credentials directory, relative to ServerRoot.
              Used by GridHTTP to record the credentials obtained via HTTPS, and available to the  corresponding
              HTTP   request   or   subsequent   HTTPS   requests   following   a  session  restart.   (Default:
              /var/www/sessions)

       GridSiteACLFormat GACL|XACML
              Format to use when writing .gacl files. (Both formats are automatically recognised when  reading.)
              (Default: GACL)

       GridSiteACLPath path
              Specify  the  absolute  or relative (to ServerRoot) path of the ACL file governing this section of
              the server's URL space. This can be applied to virtual URL spaces provided by other modules,  such
              as  DAV  or SVN, using the Apache &lt;Location&gt; container. If the path contains %0, it is replaced by
              this virtual server's hostname. If it contains %1, %2, ... it is replaced with the 1st,  2nd,  ...
              component  of  the  request's  URI,  separated  by slashes and counting from immediately after the
              initial slash.

       GridSiteExecMethod nosetuid|suexec|X509DN|directory
              Execution strategy for CGI scripts and executables. For options other than  nosetuid,  suexec  (or
              gsexec  renamed  suexec)  must  installed.  For X509DN and directory, gsexec must be installed, as
              suexec. See <b><a href="../man8/gsexec.8.html">gsexec</a>(8)</b> for  an  explanation  of  the  different  execution  strategies.   (Default:
              nosetuid)

       GridSiteUserGroup user group
              Unix  user  and  group  when  using suexec (or gsexec as suexec.) This is equivalent to the suexec
              SuexecUserGroup directive, but can be specified on a per-directory basis. (Default: none)

       GridSiteDiskMode GroupNone|GroupRead|GroupWrite WorldNone|WorldRead
              The file creation  permissions  mode,  taking  two  arguments  to  specify  the  group  and  other
              permissions.  The  mode  always  includes  read  and  write  permission  for  the CGI user itself.
              (Default: GroupNone WorldNone)

       GridSiteCastUniPort port
              The <b>UDP</b> unicast port to listen on for HTCP queries, and from which to send replies to HTCP unicast
              and multicast queries. Ideally, this should be a privileged port below 1024.  This  directive  may
              not appear within a virtual server. (Default: 777)

       GridSiteCastGroup group[:port]
              A  UDP  multicast  group on which to listen for HTCP queries, plus an optional port. If no port is
              given, then 777 is used. Multiple GridSiteCastGroup directives can  be  given  to  cause  the  UDP
              responder  to  listen  to  more  than  one multicast group. This directive may not appear within a
              virtual server.

       GridSiteCastAlias URL-prefix path-prefix
              Maps SiteCast generic URLs to  the  local  filesystem.  When  processing  HTCP  queries,  matching
              SiteCast  URLs  will  have  URL-prefix  stripped off and the remaining portion of the URL added to
              path-prefix to construct a local path and filename. If a file is found with that name, a  SiteCast
              HTCP  response  will  be  returned  to the querying host. Otherwise the queries are ignored.  This
              directive may appear within virtual servers, and the virtual server's servername  and  first  port
              will determine the host and port name used to construct the transfer URL.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  following variables are present in the environment of CGI programs and other dynamic content systems
       if the <b>GridSiteEnvs</b> <b>on</b> directive is in effect.

       GRST_PERM
              Numerical value of the permission bit-map obtained by comparing the user with the GACL  in  force.
              (These should be tested using the GRSTgaclPermHasXXXX functions from GACL.)

       GRST_PASSCODE_COOKIE
              Value  of  GRIDHTTP_PASSCODE  cookie  that  should  be  returned when using a double-submit cookie
              procedure to guard against Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This is only set if a  valid
              passcode file was found in the server's sessions directory.

       GRST_ADMIN_LIST
              URI of the DN List, listing people with full admin and write access to the whole site.

       GRST_GSIPROXY_LIMIT
              Maximum valid delegation level for GSI Proxies.

       GRST_DIR_PATH
              Absolute path in the local filesystem to the directory holding the file being requested.

       GRST_DESTINATION_TRANSLATED
              Present  if  a  WebDAV <b>Destination:</b> header was given in the request with a local URL. Contains the
              translation of the URL given into an absolute path in the local filesystem.

       GRST_HELP_URI
              URI of website help pages set by GridSiteHelpURI directive.

       GRST_ADMIN_FILE
              Filename of per-directory ghost  gridsite-admin.cgi  program.  (This  is  used  by  real-gridsite-
              admin.cgi to construct links in its pages.)

       GRST_EDITABLE
              Space-separated list of extensions which can safely be edited with a Text/HTML editor.

       GRST_HEAD_FILE and GRST_FOOT_FILE
              Filenames of standard header and footer files.

       GRST_DN_LISTS
              DN lists search path.

       GRST_DN_LISTS_URI
              Directory of virtual URIs used to publish this site's DN Lists.

       GRST_UNZIP
              Full path to the <b><a href="../man1/unzip.1.html">unzip</a>(1)</b> binary, used to list and unpack .zip files.

       GRST_NO_LINK
              If set, do not include credit links to GridSite in page footers.

       GRST_ACL_FORMAT
              Format to use when writing .gacl files: either GACL or XACML.

       GRST_EXEC_METHOD
              Specified by <b>GridSiteExecMethod</b> either suexec, X509DN or directory.

       GRST_EXEC_DIRECTORY
              The  directory  containing  the  CGI  script or executable (used by gsexec to determine which pool
              account to use in directory mapping mode.)

       GRST_DISK_MODE
              The <b>Apache</b> disk permission modes bit pattern, in hexadecimal, starting with 0x.  (Similar  to  the
              Unix  bit  pattern,  except  with  hexadecimal rather than octal values: eg 0x600 [Apache] vs 0600
              [Unix] are both read/write for user only.)
