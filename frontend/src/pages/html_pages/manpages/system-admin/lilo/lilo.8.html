        <b>lilo</b> <b>{-u|-U}</b>   # uninstall LiLO boot loader

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       lilo installs a boot loader that will be activated the next time you boot your system. The default
       configuration file <u>/etc/lilo.conf</u> (see manpage <u><a href="../man5/lilo.conf.5.html">lilo.conf</a></u>(5)) will contain most options, but many,
       including those which override the configuration file, may be specified  on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-A</b> <u>master-device</u> <u>[N]</u>
           Used with a single argument, inquire of active partition on device <u>master-device</u>; e.g. <u>/dev/sda</u>. With
           N==0:  deactivate  all  partitions  on the device. With N in the range [1..n]: activate the specified
           partition and deactivate all others.  Normally, only primary partitions [1..4] may be activated,  but
           if  the  'Extended  Master Boot Loader' is present on the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the device (see
           the -M option), any partition may be made active.  Whether the actual OS in the partition  will  boot
           from a logical partition depends on the characteristics of the OS. LILO boot records for Linux may be
           booted from a logical partition.

       <b>-b</b> <u>bootdev</u>
           Set the boot device where the boot loader will be installed. For example <u>"-b</u> <u>/dev/sda"</u> set the Master
           Boot Record (MBR) on the first disk as boot device. <u>"-b</u> <u>/dev/sdb5"</u> set the first logical partition on
           the second disk as boot device.

       <b>-B</b> <u>bitmap-file</u>
           Define a bitmap file for the boot-time graphics screen, preferably one already pre-processed with the
           <u>-E</u> option.

       <b>-c</b>  Enable  map  compaction.  This will merge read requests from adjacent sectors.  Speeds up the booting
           especially from floppy.

       <b>-C</b> <u>config-file</u>
           Set another pathname and filename for the configuration  file.  The  default  configuration  file  is
           <u>/etc/lilo.conf</u>.

       <b>-d</b> <u>delay-time</u>
           Set the delay time in tenths of a second ('20' = 2 sec) before automatically booting the first image.
           This  give  you  time  to interrupt the automatic boot process with: Shift, Alt, Ctrl, ScrollLock, or
           CapsLock. If interrupted, the <u>boot:</u> prompt will be displayed.

           This switch will be overridden by the appearance of <u>prompt</u> in the configuration file!

       <b>-D</b> <u>label</u>
           Use the kernel with the given label as the default kernel to boot, instead of the first  one  in  the
           list of the configuration file.

       <b>-E</b> <u>filename.xxx</u>
           If  the extension <b>.xxx</b> is <b>.bmp</b>, then take the file to be a bitmap graphic file for use in the <u>bitmap=</u>
           configuration file directive. Enter an interactive editor to create  or  update  the  color/placement
           information  in the LILO header of this bitmap file. (see <u>bmp-colors</u>, <u>bmp-table</u>, and <u>bmp-timer</u> on the
           manual page for <u>lilo.conf</u> <u>(5)</u>.)

           If <b>.xxx</b> is <b>.dat</b> then take this file to be a configuration file  to  set  bitmap  graphic  parameters,
           which are transferred into the LILO header in the bitmap file of the same name.

           When  a  <b>.bmp</b>  file is modified using a graphics editor (e.g. GIMP), the LILO header will be lost. It
           can be restored using the <b>dat</b> file, which is  used  as  a  text-based  backup  for  the  LILO  header
           information.

       <b>-f</b> <u>disk-tab</u>
           Set another disk geometry parameter file. The default is <u>/etc/disktab</u>.

       <b>-F</b>  Override  boot  sector  check for filesystems (e.g., swap, ext4, xfs ...) which might be destroyed by
           the installation of the LILO boot sector on the first sector of the partition  if  these  filesystems
           use the first sector as a superblock.

           Compare with <u>-P</u> <u>ignore</u>, which bypasses certain partition table checks.

       <b>-g</b>  Generate  'cylinder/head/sector'  (CHS  geometric)  disk  addresses. Limited to cylinders up to 1023.
           Forces compatibility with very old versions of LILO <u>(obsolete</u> <u>switch)</u>.

       <b>-H</b>  Override fatal halt if a RAID array does not have all disks active.

       <b>-I</b> <u>label</u> <u>[D|a|i|k|r|R]</u>
           <b>label</b> is taken to be the name of an image specified in the configuration  file.   This  command  will
           print  the  path  name  of  the  corresponding kernel file, keytable file, initial ramdisk file, root
           specification, or "append=" string ("i", "k", "r", "R", or "a" option). The "D"  option  ignores  the
           <b>label</b>  parameter and prints the default "image=" label, or the first "image=" label is selected if no
           default <b>image</b> is set.

       <b>-l</b>  Generate 24-bit linear sector addresses instead of cylinder/head/sector addresses.

       <b>-L</b>  Generate 32-bit Logical Block  Addresses  (LBA)  instead  of  cylinder/head/sector  (CHS)  addresses,
           allowing  access  to  all  partitions  on  disks with more than 1024 cylinders.  (This is the default
           geometry).

       <b>-m</b> <u>map-file</u>
           Use another map file instead of the default file /boot/map.

       <b>-M</b> <u>master-device</u> <b>{mbr|ext}</b>
           Install a Master Boot Record on the device specified as  master-device,  selecting  the  Standard  or
           Extended  Master Boot Loader per option. The primary partition table on master-device is undisturbed.
           If no valid Volume-ID (serial number) is present, then generate one and write it to the MBR.  If  <u>mbr</u>
           is  set,  the Standard Master Boot Loader will search partitions 1-4 for an active flag, and boot the
           flagged partition. Only one active flag is allowed. If <u>ext</u> is set, the search for an active partition
           will include logical partitions as well.  The presence of the Extended  Master  Boot  Loader  on  the
           Master Boot Record (MBR = sector 0) of a disk affects the operation of the <u>-A</u> option.

       <b>-p</b>  Require interactive entry of all passwords set as "" in the configuration file.

       <b>-P</b> <u>{fix|ignore|&lt;global-option</u>}&gt;
           Fix  or ignore 'corrupt' partition tables, e.g. partition tables with linear and cylinder/head/sector
           addresses that do not correspond. Always try <b>ignore</b> first, as <b>fix</b> will re-write the partition  table,
           possibly destroying all partitions on the disk.

           <b>ignore</b>  is  also  used  to  bypass the partition table check for partition types within the partition
           table which might not allow the installation of a LILO boot sector. Compare with the '-F' flag, which
           overrides the check of the actual boot sector.

           <b>&lt;global-option&gt;</b> allows the passing of any global option which may appear in the global section  (top)
           of the  configuration file (<u>/etc/lilo.conf</u>).  For instance <u>'-P</u> <u>nowarn'</u> will pass the 'nowarn' option,
           just  as though 'nowarn' appeared in the configuration file (same as the '-w' switch).  Similarly <u>'-P</u>
           <u>timeout=50'</u> will add or override the 'timeout=' line  in  the   configuration  file.  Note  that  the
           general  <b>-P</b>  switch  actually duplicates a number of command line option switches. However, it is not
           strictly the same as some  switches  which  cause  an  override  of  other  options;  e.g.  '-g'  (-P
           geometric), '-L' (-P lba32).

       <b>-q</b>  List  the  currently  mapped files. <b>lilo</b> maintains a file, by default <u>/boot/map</u>, containing each name
           and location of the kernel(s) to boot. This option will list the names therein.  Use with <b>-v</b> for more
           detailed information about the installed boot loader.

       <b>-r</b> <u>root-directory</u>
           Before doing anything else, do a <u>'chroot'</u> to the indicated directory. The  new  root  directory  must
           contain a <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> directory and may need a <a href="file:/boot">/boot</a> directory.  It may also need an <u>/etc/lilo.conf</u> file.

       <b>-R</b> <u>command-line</u>
           This   option  sets  the  default  command  for  the boot loader for the next time it executes. After
           execution the boot loader will erase this line because it is a once-only  command.  It  is  typically
           used in reboot scripts, just before calling 'shutdown -r'. Used without any arguments, it will cancel
           a <u>lock</u>-ed or <u>fallback</u> command line.

           This  Command  line  starts with image identifier (as shown during map file update), then space, then
           kernel parameters. The kernel parameters are appended to kernel command line  constructed  routinely.
           In  either  case,  it  there were parameters or not, such one-time command will be treated by loaders
           code, as if it is set at 'boot:' prompt. This could lead to  'password:'  prompt  at  boot  time.  Be
           warned!  Refer to <u><a href="../man5/lilo.conf.5.html">lilo.conf</a>(5)</u> for details.

       <b>-s</b> <u>save-file</u>
           When  lilo  writes  a new boot sector, it preserves the former contents of the boot sector in a file,
           named by default /boot/boot.NNNN, where NNNN is the hexadecimal representation of the major and minor
           device numbers of the drive/partition.

           This option defines the backup save file in one of three ways: a save directory (default is  '<a href="file:/boot">/boot</a>')
           using the default filename 'boot.NNNN' in the defined directory; a pathname template to which '.NNNN'
           is appended (default would be '/boot/boot'); or the full pathname of the file, which must include the
           correct '.NNNN' suffix. When used with the -u option, the full file pathname must be set.

       <b>-S</b> <u>save-file</u>
           Normally  lilo  will  not  overwrite  an  existing  boot  sector  save  file.  This options says that
           overwriting is to be forced. As with -s, the setting may be of a save directory,  pathname  template,
           or full pathname (which includes the '.NNNN' suffix).

       <b>-t</b>  Test  only.  Do not really write a new boot sector or map file. Use together with <b>-v</b> to find out what
           lilo is about to do.

       <b>-T</b> <u>option</u>
           Print out system information, some of it extracted from system bios. This  is  more  convenient  than
           booting the LILO diagnostic floppy on problem systems. <b>option</b> may be any one of the following:

            help          print a list of available diagnostics
            ChRul         list the partition types subject to
                            Change-Rules
            EBDA          list Extended BIOS Data Area information
            geom=&lt;drive&gt;  list drive geometry for bios drive;
                            e.g. geom=0x80
            geom          list drive geometry for all drives
            table=&lt;drive&gt; list the primary partition table;
                            e.g. table=/dev/sda
            video         list graphic modes available to boot
                            loader

       <b>-u</b> <u>[device-name]</u>
           Uninstall  lilo  by  copying the saved boot sector back. The <b>-s</b> and <b>-C</b> switches may be used with this
           option. The device-name is optional. A time-stamp is checked.

       <b>-U</b> <u>[device-name]</u>
           The same as '-u', but do not check the time-stamp.

       <b>-v</b> <u>[number]</u>
           Increase verbosity. Giving one to five <b>-v</b> options will make lilo more  verbose.   The  <b>number</b>  (range
           1..5) set verbosity level.

       <b>-V</b>  Print version number.

       <b>-w</b><u>[+|-]</u>
           Used  as  <b>-w</b>  or  <b>-w-</b>  to  suppress  warning  messages.  Used  as  '-w+'  to override <u>'nowarn'</u> in the
           configuration file and show warning messages.

       <b>-x</b> <u>option</u>
           For RAID installations  only. The option may be any of the keywords: <u>none</u>, <u>auto</u>, <u>mbr</u>, <u>mbr-only</u>, or  a
           comma separated list of additional boot devices (no spaces allowed in the list).

           RAID installations write the boot record to the RAID partition. Conditional writing of MBRs may occur
           to  aid  in  making  the  RAID  set  bootable in a recovery situation, but all default actions may be
           overridden. Action similar to previous versions is achieved using the <u>'-x</u> <u>mbr-only'</u> switch.

       <b>-X</b>  Reserved for LILO internal use. May produce different output for different LILO  versions.  The  line
           beginning "CFLAGS=" will contain the compiler options used to generate this version of LILO.

       <b>-z</b>  When  used  with  the  '-M'  switch, clears the Volume-ID.  Usually used in the following sequence to
           generate a new Volume-ID:

               lilo -z -M /dev/sda
               lilo -M /dev/sda

       <b>-Z</b> <u>option</u>
           Tells the boot installer whether special precautions need to be taken because the BIOS fails to  pass
           the  correct  device  code  in  DL  (-Z0).  Or  may specify that the BIOS always gets DL right (-Z1).
           Corresponds to, and overrides, the configuration file option 'bios-passes-dl='.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIG</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The above command line options correspond to the key words in the config file indicated below.

                     -b bootdev       boot=bootdev

                     -B file.bmp      bitmap=file.bmp
                     -c               compact
                     -d dsec          delay=dsec
                     -D label         default=label
                     -f file          disktab=file
                     -g               geometric
                     -l               linear
                     -L               lba32
                     -m mapfile       map=mapfile
                     -P fix           fix-table
                     -P ignore        ignore-table
                     -s file          backup=file
                     -S file          force-backup=file
                     -v [N]           verbose=N
                     -w               nowarn
                     -x option        raid-extra-boot=option
                     -Z option        bios-passes-dl=option

</pre><h4><b>BOOT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  options  described  here may be specified at boot time on the command line when a  kernel  image  is
       booted. These options are processed by LILO, and are removed from the command line before it is passed to
       the kernel, unless otherwise noted.

       <b>lock</b>
           Locks the command line, as though 'lock' had been defined in <u>/etc/lilo.conf</u>.

       <b>mem=###[,K,M,G]</b>
           Set the maximum memory in the system in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes.  This option is not
           removed from the command line, and is always passed to the kernel.

       <b>nobd</b>
           Suppresses  the  BIOS data check. This option is reserved for use with non-IBM-compliant BIOS's which
           hang with the lines:

               Loading...............
               BIOS data check

       <b>vga=[ASK,EXT,EXTENDED,NORMAL,###,0x###]</b>
           Allows overriding the default video mode upon kernel startup.

</pre><h4><b>BOOT</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The  boot process takes place in two stages. The first stage loader is a single sector, and is loaded  by
       the  BIOS  or  by the loader in the MBR. It loads the multi-sector second stage loader, but is very space
       limited. When the first stage  loader  gets  control, it types  the  letter 'L';  when  it  is  ready  to
       transfer  control  to  the  second stage loader it types the letter 'I'. If any error occurs, like a disk
       read error, it will put out a hexadecimal error code and then re-try the operation.  All hex error  codes
       are BIOS return values, except for the lilo-generated codes: 40, 99 and 9A. A partial list of error codes
       follows:

           00  no error
           01  invalid disk command
           02  address mark not found
           03  disk write-protected
           04  sector not found
           06  floppy disk removed
           08  DMA overrun
           0A  bad sector flag
           0B  bad track flag
           20  controller failure
           40  seek failure (BIOS)
           40  cylinder&gt;1023 (LILO)
           99  invalid second stage index sector (LILO)
           9A  no second stage loader signature (LILO)
           AA  drive not ready
           FF  sense operation failed

       Error  code  40  is  generated  by  the  BIOS, or by LILO during the conversion of a linear (24-bit) disk
       address to a geometric (C:H:S) address. On older systems which do not support lba32 (32-bit)  addressing,
       this  error  may  also  be generated.  Errors 99 and 9A usually mean the map file ('-m' or 'map=') is not
       readable, likely because LILO was not re-run after some system change, or there is  a  geometry  mismatch
       between what LILO used (lilo -v3 to display) and what is actually being used by the BIOS (one of the lilo
       diagnostic  disks, available in the source distribution, may be needed to diagnose this problem).

       When   the  second  stage loader has received control from the first stage, it prints the letter 'L', and
       when it has initialized itself, including verifying the "Descriptor Table" - the list  of  kernels/others
       to boot - it will print the letter "O", to form the full word "LILO", in uppercase.

       All  second  stage loader error messages are English text and try to pinpoint, more or less successfully,
       the point of failure.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration file options 'backup' and 'force-backup' should specify a backup directory or  backup  file
       pathname  template  on  all RAID installations. Use of an explicit filename may not allow multiple backup
       files to be created correctly.  It is best to use the  default mechanism, as it works  correctly  in  all
       cases.
