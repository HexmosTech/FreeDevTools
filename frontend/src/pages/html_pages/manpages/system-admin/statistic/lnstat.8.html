</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lnstat - unified linux network statistics

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lnstat</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>lnstat</b> command.

       <b>lnstat</b>  is a generalized and more feature-complete replacement for the old rtstat program. It is commonly
       used to periodically print a selection of statistical values exported by  the  kernel.   In  addition  to
       routing  cache  statistics,  it  supports  any  kind of statistics the linux kernel exports via a file in
       <a href="file:/proc/net/stat/.">/proc/net/stat/.</a>

       Each file in <a href="file:/proc/net/stat/">/proc/net/stat/</a> contains a header line listing the column names.  These names  are  used  by
       <b>lnstat</b>  as  keys  for  selecting  which  statistics to print. For every CPU present in the system, a line
       follows which lists the actual values for each column of the file. <b>lnstat</b> sums these values up (which  in
       fact  are  counters)  before printing them. After each interval, only the difference to the last value is
       printed.

       Files and columns may be selected by using the <b>-f</b> and <b>-k</b> parameters. By default, all columns of all files
       are printed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       lnstat supports the following options.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show summary of options.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Show version of program.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--count</b> <b>&lt;count&gt;</b>
              Print &lt;count&gt; number of intervals.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--dump</b>
              Dump list of available files/keys.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--file</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Statistics file to use, may be specified multiple times. By default all  files  in  <a href="file:/proc/net/stat">/proc/net/stat</a>
              are scanned.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--interval</b> <b>&lt;intv&gt;</b>
              Set interval to 'intv' seconds.

       <b>-j,</b> <b>--json</b>
              Display results in JSON format

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--keys</b> <b>k,k,k,...</b>
              Display  only keys specified. Each key <b>k</b> is of the form <b>[file:]key</b>. If <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> is given, the search
              for the given key is limited to that file. Otherwise the first file containing the searched key is
              being used.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--subject</b> <b>[0-2]</b>
              Specify display of subject/header. '0' means no header at all, '1' prints a header only  at  start
              of the program and '2' prints a header every 20 lines.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--width</b> <b>n,n,n,...</b>
              Width for each field.
