       systemd-random-seed.service, systemd-random-seed - Load and save the OS system random seed at boot and
       shutdown

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       systemd-random-seed.service

       <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-random-seed">/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-random-seed</a>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       systemd-random-seed.service is a service that loads an on-disk random seed into the kernel entropy pool
       during boot and saves it at shutdown. See <b><a href="../man4/random.4.html">random</a></b>(4) for details. By default, no entropy is credited when
       the random seed is written into the kernel entropy pool, but this may be changed with
       <u>$SYSTEMD_RANDOM_SEED_CREDIT</u>, see below. On disk the random seed is stored in
       /var/lib/systemd/random-seed.

       Note that this service runs relatively late during the early boot phase, i.e. generally after the initrd
       phase has finished and the <a href="file:/var/">/var/</a> file system has been mounted. Many system services require entropy much
       earlier than this — this service is hence of limited use for complex system. It is recommended to use a
       boot loader that can pass an initial random seed to the kernel to ensure that entropy is available from
       earliest boot on, for example <b><a href="../man7/systemd-boot.7.html">systemd-boot</a></b>(7), with its <b>bootctl</b> <b>random-seed</b> functionality.

       When loading the random seed from disk, the file is immediately updated with a new seed retrieved from
       the kernel, in order to ensure no two boots operate with the same random seed. This new seed is retrieved
       synchronously from the kernel, which means the service will not complete start-up until the random pool
       is fully initialized. On entropy-starved systems this may take a while. This functionality is intended to
       be used as synchronization point for ordering services that require an initialized entropy pool to
       function securely (i.e. services that access /dev/urandom without any further precautions).

       Care should be taken when creating OS images that are replicated to multiple systems: if the random seed
       file is included unmodified each system will initialize its entropy pool with the same data, and thus —
       if otherwise entropy-starved — generate the same or at least guessable random seed streams. As a safety
       precaution crediting entropy is thus disabled by default. It is recommended to remove the random seed
       from OS images intended for replication on multiple systems, in which case it is safe to enable entropy
       crediting, see below. Also see <b>Safely</b> <b>Building</b> <b>Images</b>[1].

       See <b>Random</b> <b>Seeds</b>[2] for further information.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$SYSTEMD_RANDOM_SEED_CREDIT</u>
           By default, systemd-random-seed.service does not credit any entropy when loading the random seed.
           With this option this behaviour may be changed: it either takes a boolean parameter or the special
           string "force". Defaults to false, in which case no entropy is credited. If true, entropy is credited
           if the random seed file and system state pass various superficial concisistency checks. If set to
           "force" entropy is credited, regardless of these checks, as long as the random seed file exists.

           Added in version 243.
