</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Crack, Reporter - programs to break password files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Crack</b> <u>[options]</u> <u>[-fmt</u> <u>format]</u> <u>[file</u> <u>...]</u>
       <b>Crack-Reporter</b> <u>[-quiet]</u> <u>[-html]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual page documents briefly the <b>Crack,</b> and <b>Crack-Reporter</b> commands.  This manual page was written
       for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead,
       there is some documentation available at <u>/usr/share/doc/crack</u> which you are encouraged to read

       <b>Crack</b> is not a program designed to break the password of every user in the file.  Rather, it is  designed
       to find weak passwords in the file, by attacking those sorts of bad passwords which are most likely to be
       used,  in the order in which they would most easily be found (ie: are most likely to be used by a moronic
       user).

       Crack is not designed to break user passwords; it is designed to break password files.  This is a  subtle
       but important distinction.

       <b>Crack-Reporter</b> will show what passwords have been cracked, as well as view errors that have been detected
       in  the  source  password  files,  etc.   Guesses  are  listed  chronologically, so users who wish to see
       incremental changes in the output as Crack continues  to  run  over  a  course  of  days  or  weeks,  are
       encouraged to wrap invocations of <b>Crack-Reporter</b> in a script with <b>diff</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A summary of options are included below.  For Crack:

       <b>-makedict</b>
              Creates and compresses the dictionaries <b>Crack</b> will use

       <b>-makeonly</b>
              Compiles  the  binaries  for  <b>Crack</b>  (not  necessary  for  Debian GNU/Linux since they are already
              provided)

       <b>-debug</b> Lets you see what the Crack script is doing.

       <b>-recover</b>
              Used when restarting  an  abnormally-terminated  run;  suppresses  rebuild  of  the  gecos-derived
              dictionaries.

       <b>-fgnd</b>  Runs  the  password cracker in the foreground, with stdin, stdout and stderr attached to the usual
              places.

       <b>-fmt</b> <b>format</b>
              Specifies the input file format.

       <b>-from</b> <b>N</b>
              Starts password cracking from rule number "N".

       <b>-keep</b>  Prevents deletion of the temporary file used to store the password cracker's input.

       <b>-mail</b>  E-Mail a warning message to anyone whose password is cracked.  See the script <b>nastygram</b>.

       <b>-network</b>
              Runs the password cracker in <u>network</u> mode.

       <b>-nice</b> <b>N</b>
              Runs the password cracker at a reduced priority, so that other jobs can  take  priority  over  the
              CPU.

       <b>-kill</b> <b>filename</b>

       <b>-remote</b>
              Internal options used to support networking.

              For  Crack-Reporter  <b>-html</b>  Produces  output  in  a  fairly  basic  HTML-readable  format.  <b>-quiet</b>
              Suppresses the reporting of errors in the password file (corrupt entries, etc)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To run Crack

          # Crack -nice 10 <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>

       If a Crack session is killed accidentally, it can be restarted with moderate efficiency by doing:

           mv run/Dhostname.N run/tempfilename
           Crack -recover -fmt spf run/tempfilename

       However if all you wish to do is start cracking passwords from some specific rule number, or to restart a
       run whilst skipping over a few rulesets, try:

           Crack [-recover] -from N filename ...

       ...where N is the number of the rule to start working from.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/usr/share/Crack</u> Location of the Crack program and scripts.  <u>/var/lib/Crack/</u> Location for  the  temporary
       files used by Crack.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       You  will  find more documentation about Crack in the text files available in <u>/usr/share/doc/crack-common</u>
       Documentation includes the program's Manual (in  HTML  and  Text  files),  the  User's  Frequently  Asked
       Questions (FAQ), examples, articles and even some humour.
