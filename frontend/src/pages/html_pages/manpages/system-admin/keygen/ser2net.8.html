</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ser2net - Serial to network proxy

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ser2net</b> [-c configfile] [-C sysconfdir] [-Y configline] [-p controlport] [-n] [-d] [-b] [-v] [-P pidfile]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ser2net</b> daemon allows telnet and tcp sessions to be established with a unit's serial ports or with an
       IPMI Serial Over LAN (SOL) interface.

       The  program  comes up normally as a daemon, opens the network ports specified in the configuration file,
       and waits for connections.  Once a connection occurs, the program attempts to set up the  connection  and
       open  the serial port.  If another user is already using the connection or serial port, the connection is
       refused with an error message.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-c</u> <u>config-file</u>
              Set the configuration file to one other than the default of  <b>sysconfdir/ser2net/ser2net.yaml</b>.   If
              the  <b>config-file</b>  is  <b>-</b>  then  standard  input  is  read  as  the config file.  See -C for info on
              sysconfdir

       <u>-C</u> <u>sysconfdir</u>
              Set the directory where the configuration file  and  ssl  keys  are  stored.   This  is  generally
              /etc/ser2net  on Unix-type systems, on Windows it is ../etc/ser2net from the executable's location
              by default.

       <u>-a</u> <u>authdir</u>
              Set the  default  directory  where  authentication  information  is  stored.   This  is  generally
              /usr/share/ser2net  on  Unix-type systems, on Windows it is ../share/ser2net from the executable's
              location by default.  This can be overridden in the config file.  See the ser2net.yaml.5 for  info
              on what this does.

       <u>-A</u> <u>admin-authdir</u>
              Set the default directory where the administrator's authentication information is stores.  This is
              <b>sysconfdir/auth</b>  by  default.   This can be overridden in the config file.  See the ser2net.yaml.5
              for info on what this does.

       <u>-Y</u> <u>yaml-config-string</u>
              Add a yaml config string to the end of strings to be processed.  This may  be  specified  multiple
              times for multiple strings.  These are appended onto the end of a yaml config file; though if this
              is specified, the default config file is disabled and you have to enable it with the -c option.

              To  make things easier to handle, any # in the config string that is not inside quotes (what would
              normally start a comment in yaml) is converted to a new line.  Plus a new line is added after each
              separate config string.  So, for instance:

                -Y 'connection: &amp;con01#  accepter: tcp,2013'
                -Y '  connector: serialdev,/dev/ttyEcho0,9600n81,local'
                -Y '  options:#    banner: "### A Banner ###\r\n"'

              can be put on the ser2net command line.

       <u>-n</u>     Stops  the  daemon  from  forking  and  detaching from the controlling terminal.  This  is  useful
              for running from init.

       <u>-d</u>     Like  -n,  but  also  sends  the system logs to standard output. This is most useful for debugging
              purposes.

       <u>-P</u> <u>pidfile</u>
              If specified, put the process id (pid) of ser2net in the pidfile, replacing whatever was  in  that
              file  previously.  A pidfile is not created by default, you must specify this to create one.  Note
              also that this filename must be specific with the full path, as ser2net will change  directory  to
              "/" when it becomes a daemon.

       <u>-u</u>     If UUCP locking is enabled, this will disable the use of UUCP locks.

       <u>-b</u>     Cisco IOS uses a different mechanism for specifying the baud rates than the mechanism described in
              RFC2217.   This  option sets the IOS version of setting the baud rates.  The default is RFC2217's.
              Note that this capability is now handled automatically and this option is ignored.

       <u>-v</u>     Prints the version of the program and exits.

       <u>-t</u> <u>&lt;num</u> <u>threads&gt;</u>
              Spawn the given number of threads for ser2net to use.  The default is 1.  Only valid  if  pthreads
              is enabled at build time.

       <u>-p</u> <u>&lt;admin-accepter&gt;</u>
              Enables  the  admin  interface  on  the  given  accepter specification.  See "ADMIN CONNECTION" in
              <a href="../man5/ser2net.yaml.5.html">ser2net.yaml</a>(5) for more details on how to configure this, and "ADMIN INTERFACE" below for details
              on how to use it.

       <u>-s</u> <u>signature</u>
              Specifies the default RFC2217 signature.

</pre><h4><b>ADMIN</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       The admin interface provides a simple interface for controlling the ports and viewing  their  status.  To
       accomplish this, it has the following commands:

       <b>showport</b> <b>[&lt;network</b> <b>port&gt;]</b>
              Show information about a port. If no port is given, all ports are displayed.

       <b>showshortport</b> <b>[&lt;network</b> <b>port&gt;]</b>
              Show  information  about  a  port,  each  port  on  one  line.  If no port is given, all ports are
              displayed.  This can produce very wide output.

       <b>help</b>   Display a short list and summary of commands.

       <b>exit</b>   Disconnect from the control port.

       <b>yaml</b>   Go into yaml output mode.  See YAML MODES below.

       <b>version</b>
              Display the version of this program.

       <b>monitor</b> <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> <b>&lt;network</b> <b>port&gt;</b>
              Display all the input for a given port on the calling control port.  Only  one  direction  may  be
              monitored at a time.  The type field may be <u>tcp</u> or <u>term</u> and specifies whether to monitor data from
              the  network  port  or  from  the  serial  port  Note  that data monitoring is best effort, if the
              controller port cannot keep up the data will be silently dropped.  A controller may  only  monitor
              one thing and a port may only be monitored by one controller.

       <b>monitor</b> <b>stop</b>
              Stop the current monitor.

       <b>disconnect</b> <b>&lt;network</b> <b>port&gt;</b>
              Disconnect the tcp connection on the port.

       <b>setporttimeout</b> <b>&lt;network</b> <b>port&gt;</b> <b>&lt;timeout&gt;</b>
              Set  the amount of time in seconds before the port connection will be shut down if no activity has
              been seen on the port.

       <b>setportconfig</b> <b>&lt;network</b> <b>port&gt;</b> <b>&lt;config&gt;</b>
              Set the port configuration as in the device configuration in the  <b>/etc/ser2net/ser2net.yaml</b>  file.
              If  conflicting options are specified, the last option will be the one used.  Note that these will
              not change until the port is disconnected and connected again.  Options  <u>300,</u>  <u>1200,</u>  <u>2400,</u>  <u>4800,</u>
              <u>9600,</u>  <u>19200,</u>  <u>38400,</u>  <u>57600,</u>  <u>115200</u>  set  the  various  baud  rates.  The following speed may be
              available if your system has the values defined and your hardware  supports  it:  230400,  460800,
              500000,  576000,  921600,  1000000, 1152000, 1500000, 2000000, 2500000, 3000000, 3500000, 4000000.
              Parity, databits, and stopbits may be specified in the classical manner after  the  speed,  as  in
              9600N81.  This has the following format: <b>&lt;speed&gt;[N|E|O|M|S[5|6|7|8[1|2]]].</b>  Setting serial options
              this  way does not work on SOL, SOL has fixed N81 serial options.  <u>EVEN,</u> <u>ODD,</u> <u>NONE</u> <u>(MARK</u> <u>and</u> <u>SPACE</u>
              <u>if</u> <u>supported)</u> set the parity.  <u>1STOPBIT,</u> <u>2STOPBITS</u>  set  the  number  of  stop  bits.   <u>7DATABITS,</u>
              <u>8DATABITS</u>  set  the number of data bits.  <u>[-]XONXOFF</u> turns on (- off) XON/XOFF support.  <u>[-]RTSCTS</u>
              turns on (- off) hardware flow control.  <u>[-]LOCAL</u> ignores (- checks) the modem control lines (DCD,
              DTR, etc.)

       <b>setportcontrol</b> <b>&lt;network</b> <b>port&gt;</b> <b>&lt;controls&gt;</b>
              Modify dynamic port controls.  These do not stay between connections.  Controls are: <u>DTRHI,</u>  <u>DTRLO</u>
              Turns on and off the DTR line.  <u>RTSHI,</u> <u>RTSLO</u> Turns on and off the RTS line.

       <b>setportenable</b> <b>&lt;network</b> <b>port&gt;</b> <b>&lt;enable</b> <b>state&gt;</b>
              Sets the port operation state.  Valid states are: <u>off</u> to shut the network port down, <u>raw</u> to enable
              the  network port transfer all I/O as-is, <u>rawlp</u> to enable the network port input and device output
              without termios setting, and <u>telnet</u> to enable the network port is up run  the  telnet  negotiation
              protocol on the port.

       <b>reload</b> Causes  ser2net  to reload its configuration.  Any error output will come out in the output, along
              with going to syslog.

   <b>YAML</b> <b>MODES</b>
       If the "yaml" command is issued, echo is turned off and all  output  is  YAML  compliant.   The  form  is
       basically  the  same  as  the non-YAML output, with some minor adjustments to make it YAML compliant.  In
       addition, all responses are in the form:

         %YAML 1.1
         ---
         response:
           &lt;response info here&gt;
         ...

       If there is an error, it is returned in the response with the "error" key.  If the command succeeded,  no
       "error" key will be present in the response mapping.  The "..." will be at the end of all responses.

       The  following  commands  are  available  in  yaml  output  mode:  exit,  version,  showport, disconnect,
       setporttimeout, setportenable, setportcontrol, reload,

       If "%YAML" is seen in the input, YAML input and output modes are activated, echo  is  disabled,  and  all
       input is expected to be in the form:

         ---
         command:
           name: &lt;command name&gt;
           id: &lt;optional id&gt;
           parms: [ parm1 [, parm2 [...]]]
         ...

       The  id  is  optional and will just be returned in the response.  The parms are optional, too, unless the
       command requires them.  Extra parms are ignored, along with unknown keys in the main mapping.

       Note that you have to deal with the "-&gt;" that is issued when the connection is made,  before  going  into
       YAML mode, YAML doesn't handle that well.

       In YAML output mode, you will get asynchronous reports of connections and disconnections in the form:

         %YAML 1.1
         ---
         new connection:
           name: !!str 'con1'
           remaddr: !!str 'ipv6,::1,59072'
         ...

         %YAML 1.1
         ---
         disconnect:
           name: !!str 'con1'
           remaddr: !!str 'ipv6,::1,59072'
         ...

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration  is  accomplished  through the file <b>/etc/ser2net/ser2net.yaml</b>.  A file with another name or
       path may be specified using the <u>-c</u> option.

       The yaml configuration file is described in <a href="../man5/ser2net.yaml.5.html">ser2net.yaml</a>(5)

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SIGHUP</b>
            If ser2net receives a SIGHUP, it will reread it configuration file and make the appropriate changes.
            If an in use connection is changed or deleted, the actual change will not occur until  the  port  is
            disconnected, except that if you disable a connection it will kick the users off.

            ser2net  uses  the  name  (the  connection alias) of the connection to tell if it is new, changed or
            deleted.  If the new configuration file has a connection with the same name,  it  is  treated  as  a
            change.

            This  has  some  unusual  interactions  with  connections  that  allow  more  than  one simultaneous
            connection.  It works just like the other port, but the accepter is  disabled  and  new  connections
            will not be accepted until all the existing connections are closed.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       All error output after startup goes to syslog, not standard output, unless you use the -d option.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/ser2net/ser2net.yaml, /etc/ser2net/ser2net.key, /etc/ser2net/ser2net.crt, /usr/share/ser2net
