</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>unbound</b> - Unbound DNS validating resolver 1.22.0.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>unbound</b> [<b>-h</b>] [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>cfgfile</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Unbound</b> is a caching DNS resolver.

       It uses a built in list of authoritative nameservers for the root zone (.), the so called root hints.  On
       receiving a DNS query it will ask the root nameservers for an answer and will in almost all cases receive
       a  delegation to a top level domain (TLD) authoritative nameserver.  It will then ask that nameserver for
       an answer.  It will recursively continue until an answer is found or no answer is  available  (NXDOMAIN).
       For  performance  and  efficiency  reasons  that  answer  is  cached  for  a  certain  time (the answer's
       time-to-live or TTL).  A second query for the same name will then be answered from  the  cache.   Unbound
       can also do DNSSEC validation.

       To use a locally running <b>Unbound</b> for resolving put

             nameserver 127.0.0.1

       into <u><a href="../man5/resolv.conf.5.html">resolv.conf</a></u>(5).

       If  authoritative  DNS  is  needed  as well using <u><a href="../man8/nsd.8.html">nsd</a></u>(8), careful setup is required because authoritative
       nameservers and resolvers are using the same port number (53).

       The available options are:

       <b>-h</b>     Show the version number and commandline option help, and exit.

       <b>-c</b> <u>cfgfile</u>
              Set the config file with settings for Unbound to read instead of reading the file at  the  default
              location, /etc/unbound/unbound.conf. The syntax is described in <u><a href="../man5/unbound.conf.5.html">unbound.conf</a></u>(5).

       <b>-d</b>     Debug  flag:  do  not  fork into the background, but stay attached to the console.  This flag will
              also delay writing to the log file until the thread-spawn time, so  that  most  config  and  setup
              errors  appear  on  stderr.  If given twice or more, logging does not switch to the log file or to
              syslog, but the log messages are printed to stderr all the time.

       <b>-p</b>     Don't use a pidfile.  This argument should only be used by supervision systems  which  can  ensure
              that only one instance of Unbound will run concurrently.

       <b>-v</b>     Increase  verbosity.  If  given  multiple times, more information is logged.  This is added to the
              verbosity (if any) from the config file.

       <b>-V</b>     Show the version number and build options, and exit.
