</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sg_ident - send SCSI REPORT/SET IDENTIFYING INFORMATION command

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sg_ident</b> [<u>--ascii</u>] [<u>--clear</u>] [<u>--help</u>] [<u>--itype=IT</u>] [<u>--raw</u>] [<u>--set</u>] [<u>--verbose</u>] [<u>--version</u>] <u>DEVICE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Send  a  SCSI  REPORT  IDENTIFYING INFORMATION or SET IDENTIFYING INFORMATION command to <u>DEVICE</u>. Prior to
       SPC-4 (revision 7) these commands  were  called  REPORT  DEVICE  IDENTIFIER  and  SET  DEVICE  IDENTIFIER
       respectively.  SCSI  devices  that  support  these  two  commands  allow users to write (set) identifying
       information and report it back at some later time. The information is persistent  (i.e.  stored  on  some
       non-volatile medium within the SCSI device that will survive a power outage).

       Typically  the  space  allocated  for  the  information  is  limited:  SPC-4 (revision 7) states that for
       information type 0, the minimum length is 64 bytes and the maximum is 512 bytes.  For  other  information
       types  (1  to 126 inclusive) the maximum length is 256 bytes. Also information types 1 to 126 (inclusive)
       should contain a null terminated UTF-8 string. The author has seen  older  disks  that  only  support  16
       bytes.

       The default action when no options are given is to invoke the Report Identifying Information command with
       the  information type defaulting to zero. Error reports are sent to stderr. By default the information is
       shown in ASCII-HEX (up to 16 bytes per line)  with  an  ASCII  representation  to  the  right  with  dots
       replacing non printable characters.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--ascii</b>
              invokes the Report Identifying Information command and if anything is found interprets it as ASCII
              (or UTF-8 which is locale dependent) and prints the information to stdout.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--clear</b>
              invokes  the  Set Identifying Information command with an information length of zero. This has the
              effect of clearing the existing information.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              output the usage message then exit.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--itype</b>=<u>IT</u>
              where <u>IT</u> is the information type. Defaults to zero. The maximum value is 127 which is special  and
              cannot be used with <u>--set</u> or <u>--clear</u>. The information type of 127 (if supported) causes the REPORT
              IDENTIFYING  INFORMATION  command  to respond with a list of available information types and their
              maximum lengths in bytes. The odd numbered information types between 3 and 125 (inclusive) are not
              to be used (as they clash with the SCC-2 standard).

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>
              invokes the Report Identifying information command and if anything is found sends the  information
              (which may be binary) to stdout. Nothing else is sent to stdout however error reports, if any, are
              sent to stderr.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--set</b>
              first reads stdin until an EOF is detected then invokes the Set Identifying Information command to
              set what has been fetched from stdin as the information. The amount of data read must be between 1
              and 512 bytes length (inclusive).

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print the version string and then exit.

       This  utility  permits  users to write their own identifying information to their SCSI devices. There are
       several other types of descriptors (or designators) that the user cannot change. These include  the  SCSI
       INQUIRY  command  with  its  standard  vendor and product identification strings and the product revision
       level; plus the large amount of information  provided  by  the  "Device  Identification"  VPD  page  (see
       sg_vpd).  There  is also the READ MEDIA SERIAL NUMBER command (see sg_rmsn). The MMC-4 command set for CD
       and DVDs has a "media serial number" feature (0x109) [and a "logical unit serial number" feature].  These
       can be viewed with the sg_get_config utility.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       First,  to  see if there is an existing information whose format is unknown (for information type 0), use
       no options:

         # sg_ident /dev/sdb
          00     31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38  39 30          1234567890

       If it is ASCII then it can printed as such:

         # sg_ident --ascii /dev/sdb
         1234567890

       The information can be copied to a file, cleared and then re-asserted with this sequence:

         # sg_ident --raw /dev/sdb &gt; t
         # sg_ident --clear /dev/sdb
         # cat t | sg_ident --set /dev/sdb

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_ident is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.
