       sg_z_act_query - send a SCSI ZONE ACTIVATE or ZONE QUERY command

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sg_z_act_query</b>  [<u>--activate</u>]  [<u>--all</u>]  [<u>--force</u>]  [<u>--help</u>] [<u>--hex</u>] [<u>--inhex=FN</u>] [<u>--maxlen=LEN</u>] [<u>--num=ZS</u>]
       [<u>--other=ZDID</u>] [<u>--query</u>] [<u>--raw</u>] [<u>--verbose</u>] [<u>--version</u>] [<u>--zone=ID</u>] <u>DEVICE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sends a SCSI ZONE ACTIVATE or ZONE QUERY command to the <u>DEVICE</u>. If the <u>--activate</u> option  is  not  given,
       then  a  ZONE  QUERY  command  is  sent.   These  commands  were  added  in  the  ZBC-2  draft revision 4
       (zbc2r04.pdf).

       Both of these commands have similar cdb_s and responses hence they are both placed in this  utility.  The
       difference  is  that  only  the ZONE ACTIVATE command will potentially activate or deactivate zones. Both
       commands will perform a "Verify activations operation" as defined in ZBC-2 .

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--activate</b>
              sends a ZONE ACTIVATE command to the <u>DEVICE</u>. The default (i.e. without this option) is to  send  a
              ZONE QUERY command.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
              sets the ALL field in the cdb.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
              when  decoding  the  response  to  this command, certain sanity checks are done and if they fail a
              message is sent to stderr and a non-zero exit status is set. If this option is given those  sanity
              checks are bypassed.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              output the usage message then exit.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b>
              output the response in hexadecimal to stdout. When used once the whole response is output in ASCII
              hexadecimal  with  a  leading  address  (starting  at  0)  on each line. When used twice each zone
              activation descriptor in the response is output separately in hexadecimal. When  used  thrice  the
              whole response is output in hexadecimal with no leading address (on each line).
              The  output  format  when  this option is given thrice is suitable for a later invocation with the
              <u>--inhex=FN</u> option.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--inhex</b>=<u>FN</u>
              where <u>FN</u> is a file name whose contents are assumed to be ASCII  hexadecimal.  If  <u>DEVICE</u>  is  also
              given  then  <u>DEVICE</u>  is  ignored, a warning is issued and the utility continues, decoding the file
              named <u>FN</u>. See the "HEX, BINARY AND JSON  FORMATS"  section  in  the  sg3_utils  manpage  for  more
              information. If the <u>--raw</u> option is also given then the contents of <u>FN</u> are treated as binary.
              By  default  it  is  assumed  the  response is from a ZONE QUERY command but that shouldn't matter
              because the response of the ZONE ACTIVATE and ZONE QUERY commands is of the same form.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--maxlen</b>=<u>LEN</u>
              where <u>LEN</u> is the (maximum) response length in bytes. It is placed in the cdb's "allocation length"
              field. If not given (or <u>LEN</u> is zero) then 8192 is used.  The  maximum  allowed  value  of  <u>LEN</u>  is
              1048576.
              The draft standard disallows allocation lengths less than 64.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--num</b>=<u>ZS</u>
              where  <u>ZS</u>  is  placed in the "Number of zones" field in the cdb. This option is usually ignored if
              the <u>--all</u> option is given. If the <u>--all</u> option is not given, the default value of this field is  1
              .

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--other</b>=<u>ZDID</u>
              where  the  <u>ZDID</u> value will be placed in the "Other zone domain ID" field of the cdb to be sent to
              the <u>DEVICE</u>.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--query</b>
              causes the ZONE QUERY command to be sent to the <u>DEVICE</u>. Since this is  the  default  action,  this
              option  is typically not needed. If both this option and the <u>--activate</u> option are given, an error
              will be reported (and no command will be sent).

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>
              output response in binary (to stdout) unless the <u>--inhex=FN</u> option is also given. In that case the
              input file name (<u>FN</u>) is decoded as binary (and the output is _not_ in binary (but may be hex)).

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print the version string and then exit.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--zone</b>=<u>ID</u>
              where <u>ID</u> is placed in the cdb's ZONE ID field. A zone id is a zone  start  logical  block  address
              (LBA).  The  default value is 0. <u>ID</u> is assumed to be in decimal unless prefixed with '0x' or has a
              trailing 'h' which indicate hexadecimal. The maximum value that can be given is 2^64 - 2.  In  the
              unlikely event of wanting to give 2^64 - 1, enter "-1".

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_z_act_query is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.
