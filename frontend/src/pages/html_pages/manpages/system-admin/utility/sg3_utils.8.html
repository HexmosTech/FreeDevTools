       sg3_utils - a package of utilities for sending SCSI commands

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       sg3_utils is a package of utilities that send SCSI commands to the given <u>DEVICE</u> via a SCSI  pass  through
       interface provided by the host operating system.

       The  names  of  all  utilities start with "sg" and most start with "sg_" often followed by the name, or a
       shortening of the name, of the SCSI command that they send. For example the "sg_verify" utility sends the
       SCSI VERIFY command. A mapping between SCSI commands and the sg3_utils utilities that issue them is shown
       in the COVERAGE file. The sg_raw utility can be used to send an arbitrary SCSI command (supplied  on  the
       command line) to the given <u>DEVICE</u>.

       sg_decode_sense can be used to decode SCSI sense data given on the command line or in a file. sg_raw -vvv
       will output the T10 name of a given SCSI CDB which is most often 16 bytes or less in length.

       SCSI draft standards can be found at https://www.t10.org . The standards themselves can be purchased from
       ANSI  and  other  standards  organizations.   A  good  overview  of various SCSI standards can be seen in
       https://www.t10.org/scsi-3.htm with the SCSI command sets in the upper part of the diagram.  The  highest
       level (i.e. most abstract) document is the SCSI Architecture Model (SAM) with SAM-5 being the most recent
       standard  (ANSI  INCITS  515-2016)  with  the most recent draft being SAM-6 revision 4 . SCSI commands in
       common with all device types can be found in SCSI Primary Commands (SPC)  of  which  SPC-5  is  the  most
       recent  standard  (ANSI  INCITS  502-2020).  The  most recent SPC draft is SPC-6 revision 6. Block device
       specific commands (e.g. as used by disks) are in SBC, those for  tape  drives  in  SSC,  those  for  SCSI
       enclosures in SES and those for CD/DVD/BD drives in MMC.

       It is becoming more common to control ATA disks with the SCSI command set.  This involves the translation
       of SCSI commands to their corresponding ATA equivalents (and that is an imperfect mapping in some cases).
       The  relevant  standard  is  called  SCSI  to ATA Translation (SAT, SAT-2 and SAT-3) are now standards at
       INCITS(ANSI) and ISO while SAT-4 is at the draft stage.  The logic to perform the command translation  is
       often  called  a SAT Layer or SATL and may be within an operating system, in host bus adapter firmware or
       in an  external  device  (e.g.  associated  with  a  SAS  expander).  See  https://www.t10.org  for  more
       information.

       There  is some support for SCSI tape devices but not for their basic operation. The reader is referred to
       the "mt" utility.

       There are two generations of command line option usage. The newer utilities (written since July 2004) use
       the getopt_long() function to parse command line  options.  With  that  function,  each  option  has  two
       representations:  a  short  form  (e.g.  '-v')  and  a  longer form (e.g. '--verbose'). If an argument is
       required then it follows a space (optionally) in the short form and a "=" in the longer form (e.g. in the
       sg_verify utility '-l 2a6h' and '--lba=2a6h' are equivalent). Note that with  getopt_long(),  short  form
       options  can  be elided, for example: '-all' is equivalent to '-a -l -l'.  The <u>DEVICE</u> argument may appear
       after, between or prior to any options.

       The  older  utilities,  including  as  sg_inq,  sg_logs,  sg_modes,  sg_opcode,   sg_rbuff,   sg_readcap,
       sg_senddiag, sg_start and sg_turs had individual command line processing code typically based on a single
       "-"  followed by one or more characters. If an argument is needed then it follows a "=" ( e.g. '-p=1f' in
       sg_modes with its older interface). Various options can be elided as long as it is  not  ambiguous  (e.g.
       '-vv' to increase the verbosity).

       Over  time  the command line interface of these older utilities became messy and overloaded with options.
       So in sg3_utils version 1.23 the command line interface of these older utilities was altered to have both
       a cleaner getopt_long() interface and their older interface for backward compatibility.  By default these
       older utilities use their getopt_long() based interface.  The getopt_long() is a GNU extension (i.e.  not
       yet  POSIX  certified)  but  more recent command line utilities tend to use it. That can be overridden by
       defining the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS environment variable or using '-O' or '--old' as the first  command  line
       option. The man pages of the older utilities documents the details.

       Several  sg3_utils utilities are based on the Unix dd command (e.g. sg_dd) and permit copying data at the
       level of SCSI READ and WRITE commands. sg_dd is tightly bound to Linux and hence is not ported  to  other
       OSes.  A  more  generic utility (than sg_dd) called ddpt in a package of the same name has been ported to
       other OSes.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS environment variable is explained in the previous section. It is only for backward
       compatibility of the command line options for older utilities.

       The SG3_UTILS_INVOCATION environment variable has been implemented on some utilities that decode a lot of
       data. When SG3_UTILS_INVOCATION is set those utilities will print out a line of 60 "v" characters.  After
       that  the  utility  name  and version (which includes a date) followed by a line by line breakdown of the
       command line arguments that the utility was invoked with.  The command line arguments include the utility
       name and options in the order they were given. The output is sent to stdout. The option  is  designed  to
       help automatic testing of utilities in the package.

       The  SG3_UTILS_DSENSE  environment  variable may be set to a number. It is only used by the embedded SNTL
       within the library used by the utilities in this library. SNTL is a SCSI to NVMe Translation Layer.  This
       environment  variable  defaults  to  0  which will lead to any utility that issues a SCSI command that is
       translated to a NVMe command (by the embedded SNTL) that fails at the NVMe device, to return  SCSI  sense
       in 'fixed' format. If this variable is non-zero then then the returned SCSI sense will be in 'descriptor'
       format.

       Several    utilities    have   their   own   environment   variable   setting   (e.g.    sg_persist   has
       SG_PERSIST_IN_RDONLY). See individual utility man pages for more information.

       There is a Linux specific environment variable called SG3_UTILS_LINUX_NANO that if  defined  and  the  sg
       driver  in  the  system  is  4.0.30  or later, will show command durations in nanoseconds rather than the
       default milliseconds.  Command durations are typically only shown if --verbose is used 3 or  more  times.
       Due  to  an interface problem (a 32 bit integer that should be 64 bits with the benefit of hindsight) the
       maximum duration that can be represented in nanoseconds is about 4.2 seconds.  If  longer  durations  may
       occur then don't define this environment variable (or undefine it).

</pre><h4><b>LINUX</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMING</b></h4><pre>
       Most  disk  block  devices  have  names like /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, etc.  SCSI disks in Linux have
       always had names like that but in recent Linux kernels it has become more common  for  many  other  disks
       (including  SATA  disks  and  USB  storage  devices)  to be named like that. Partitions within a disk are
       specified by a number appended to the device name, starting at 1 (e.g. /dev/sda1 ).

       Tape drives are named /dev/st&lt;num&gt; or /dev/nst&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt; starts at zero. Additionally  one  letter
       from  this  list:  "lma"  may  be  appended  to  the name. CD, DVD and BD readers (and writers) are named
       /dev/sr&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt; start at zero. There are less used SCSI device type names,  the  dmesg  and  the
       lsscsi commands may help to find if any are attached to a running system.

       There  is  also a SCSI device driver which offers alternate generic access to SCSI devices. It uses names
       of the form /dev/sg&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt; starts at zero. The "lsscsi -g" command may  be  useful  in  finding
       these  and  which  generic  name  corresponds  to  a  device  type  name (e.g. /dev/sg2 may correspond to
       /dev/sda). In the lk 2.6 series a block SCSI generic driver was introduced and its names are of the  form
       /dev/bsg/&lt;h:c:t:l&gt;  where  h,  c,  t  and  l  are  numbers.  Again  see  the  lsscsi  command to find the
       correspondence between that SCSI tuple (i.e. &lt;h:c:t:l&gt;) and alternate device names.

       Prior to the Linux kernel 2.6 series these utilities could only use generic device names  (e.g.  /dev/sg1
       ). In almost all cases in the Linux kernel 2.6 series, any device name can be used by these utilities.

       Very little has changed in Linux device naming in the Linux kernel 3 and 4 series.

</pre><h4><b>WINDOWS</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMING</b></h4><pre>
       Storage  and  related  devices can have several device names in Windows.  Probably the most common in the
       volume name (e.g. "D:"). There are also a "class" device names such as "PhysicalDrive&lt;n&gt;", "CDROM&lt;n&gt;" and
       "TAPE&lt;n&gt;". &lt;n&gt; is an integer starting at 0 allocated in ascending order as devices  are  discovered  (and
       sometimes rediscovered).

       Some  storage  devices have a SCSI lower level device name which starts with a SCSI (pseudo) adapter name
       of the form "SCSI&lt;n&gt;:". To this is added sub-addressing in  the  form  of  a  "bus"  number,  a  "target"
       identifier  and  a  LUN  (Logical  Unit Number). The "bus" number is also known as a "PathId".  These are
       assembled to form a device name of the form: "SCSI&lt;n&gt;:&lt;bus&gt;,&lt;target&gt;,&lt;lun&gt;". The trailing ",&lt;lun&gt;" may be
       omitted in which case a LUN of zero is assumed. This  lower  level  device  name  cannot  often  be  used
       directly  since  Windows  blocks attempts to use it if a class driver has "claimed" the device. There are
       SCSI device types (e.g.  Automation/Drive interface type) for which there is no class  driver.  At  least
       two  transports  ("bus  types" in Windows jargon): USB and IEEE 1394 do not have a "scsi" device names of
       this form.

       In keeping with DOS file system conventions, the various device names can be given  in  upper,  lower  or
       mixed case. Since "PhysicalDrive&lt;n&gt;" is tedious to write, a shortened form of "PD&lt;n&gt;" is permitted by all
       utilities in this package.

       A  single  device (e.g. a disk) can have many device names. For example: "PD0" can also be "C:", "D:" and
       "SCSI0:0,1,0". The two volume names reflect that the disk has two partitions on it. Disk partitions  that
       are  not recognized by Windows are not usually given a volume name. However Vista does show a volume name
       for a disk which has no partitions recognized by it and when selected  invites  the  user  to  format  it
       (which may be rather unfriendly to other OSes).

       These  utilities  assume  a  given  device  name is in the Win32 device namespace.  To make that explicit
       "\\.\" can be prepended to the device names mentioned in this section. Beware that backslash is an escape
       character in Unix like shells and the C programming language. In a shell  like  Msys  (from  MinGW)  each
       backslash may need to be typed twice.

       The  sg_scan  utility  within  this package lists out Windows device names in a form that is suitable for
       other utilities in this package to use.

</pre><h4><b>FREEBSD</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMING</b></h4><pre>
       SCSI disks have block names of the form /dev/da&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt; is an integer starting at zero. The "da"
       is replaced by "sa" for SCSI tape drives and "cd" for SCSI CD/DVD/BD  drives.  Each  SCSI  device  has  a
       corresponding  pass-through  device name of the form /dev/pass&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt; is an integer starting at
       zero. The "camcontrol devlist" command may be  useful  for  finding  out  which  SCSI  device  names  are
       available and the correspondence between class and pass-through names.

       FreeBSD allows device names to be given without the leading "<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>" (e.g.  da0 instead of /dev/da0). That
       worked  in  this package up until version 1.43 when the unadorned device name (e.g. "da0") gave an error.
       The original action (i.e. allowing unadorned device names) has been restored in version 1.46 . Also  note
       that  symlinks  (to  device  names)  are followed before prepending "<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>" if the resultant name doesn't
       start with a "/".

       FreeBSD's NVMe naming has been evolving. The controller naming is the same as Linux:  "/dev/nvme&lt;n&gt;"  but
       the  namespaces  have  an  extra  "s"  (e.g.  "/dev/nvme0ns1").  The  latter is not a block (GEOM) device
       (strictly speaking FreeBSD does not have block devices). Initially FreeBSD had "/dev/nvd&lt;m&gt;" GEOM devices
       that were not based on the CAM subsystem. Then in FreeBSD release 12 a new nda driver was added  that  is
       CAM  (and GEOM) based for NVMe namespaces; it has names like "/dev/nda0".  The preferred device nodes for
       this package are "/dev/nvme0" for NVMe controllers and "/dev/nda0" for NVMe namespaces.

</pre><h4><b>SOLARIS</b> <b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMING</b></h4><pre>
       SCSI device names below the <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a> directory have a form like: c5t4d3s2 where the number following  "c"  is
       the  controller  (HBA)  number,  the  number  following  "t" is the target number (from the SCSI parallel
       interface days) and the number following "d" is the LUN. Following the "s" is the slice number  which  is
       related to a partition and by convention "s2" is the whole disk.

       OpenSolaris  also  has  a  c5t4d3p2 form where the number following the "p" is the partition number apart
       from "p0" which is the whole disk. So a whole disk may be referred  to  as  either  c5t4d3,  c5t4d3s2  or
       c5t4d3p0 .

       And  these device names are duplicated in the /dev/dsk and /dev/rdsk directories. The former is the block
       device name and the latter is for "raw" (or char device) access which is  what  sg3_utils  needs.  So  in
       OpenSolaris something of the form 'sg_inq /dev/rdsk/c5t4d3p0' should work.  If it doesn't work then add a
       '-vvv'  option  for  more  debug  information.   Trying this form 'sg_inq /dev/dsk/c5t4d3p0' (note "rdsk"
       changed to "dsk") will result in an "inappropriate ioctl for device" error.

       The device names within the <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a> directory are typically symbolic links to much longer topological  names
       in the /device directory. In Solaris cd/dvd/bd drives seem to be treated as disks and so are found in the
       /dev/rdsk directory. Tape drives appear in the /dev/rmt directory.

       There  is  also  a  sgen  (SCSI  generic)  driver which by default does not attach to any device. See the
       /kernel/drv/sgen.conf file to control what is attached. Any attached device will have a  device  name  of
       the form /dev/scsi/c5t4d3 .

       Listing  available  SCSI  devices  in  Solaris seems to be a challenge. "Use the 'format' command" advice
       works but seems a very dangerous way to list devices. [It does prompt again  before  doing  any  damage.]
       'devfsadm  -Cv'  cleans  out  the  clutter  in  the /dev/rdsk directory, only leaving what is "live". The
       "cfgadm -v" command looks promising.

</pre><h4><b>NVME</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       NVMe (or NVM Express) is a relatively new storage transport and command set. The level of abstraction  of
       the  NVMe  command set is somewhat lower the SCSI command sets, closer to the level of abstraction of ATA
       (and SATA) command sets. NVMe claims to be designed with flash and modern "solid state" storage in  mind,
       something unheard of when SCSI was originally developed in the 1980s.

       The  SCSI  command  sets'  advantage is the length of time they have been in place and the existing tools
       (like these) to support it. Plus SCSI command sets  level  of  abstraction  is  both  and  advantage  and
       disadvantage.  Recently  the  NVME-MI  (Management  Interface) designers decide to use the SCSI Enclosure
       Services (SES-3) standard "as is" with the addition of two tunnelling NVME-MI commands: SES Send and  SES
       Receive.   This   means  after  the  OS  interface  differences  are  taken  into  account,  the  sg_ses,
       sg_ses_microcode and sg_senddiag utilities can be used on a NVMe device that supports a newer version  of
       NVME-MI.

       The  NVME-MI  SES  Send  and  SES  Receive  commands  correspond  to the SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC and RECEIVE
       DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS commands respectively.  There are however  a  few  other  commands  that  need  to  be
       translated,   the   most   important  of  which  is  the  SCSI  INQUIRY  command  to  the  NVMe  Identify
       controller/namespace. Starting in version 1.43 these  utilities  contain  a  small  SNTL  (SCSI  to  NVMe
       Translation Layer) to take care of these details.

       As  a side effect of this "juggling" if the sg_inq utility is used (without the --page= option) on a NVMe
       <u>DEVICE</u> then the actual NVMe Identifier (controller and possibly  namespace)  responses  are  decoded  and
       output.  However  if  'sg_inq  --page=sinq  &lt;device&gt;' is given for the same <u>DEVICE</u> then parts of the NVMe
       Identify controller and namespace response are translated to a SCSI standard INQUIRY  response  which  is
       then decoded and output.

       Apart  from  the special case with the sg_inq, all other utilities in the package assume they are talking
       to a SCSI device and decode any response accordingly. One easy way for users to see the underlying device
       is a NVMe device is the standard INQUIRY response  Vendor  Identification  field  of  "NVMe     "  (an  8
       character long string with 4 spaces to the right).

       The  following  SCSI commands are currently supported by the SNTL library: INQUIRY, MODE <a href="../man10/SELECT.10.html">SELECT</a>(10), MODE
       <a href="../man10/SENSE.10.html">SENSE</a>(10), READ(10,16), READ CAPACITY(10,16), RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS,  REQUEST  SENSE,  REPORT  LUNS,
       REPORT  SUPPORTED  OPERATION  CODES,  REPORT SUPPORTED TASK MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS, SEND DIAGNOSTICS, START
       STOP UNIT, SYNCHRONIZE CACHE(10,16), TEST UNIT READY, VERIFY(10,16), WRITE(10,16) and WRITE SAME(10,16).

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       To aid scripts that call these utilities, the exit status is set to indicate success (0) or failure (1 or
       more). Note that some of the lower values correspond to the SCSI sense key values.

       The exit status values listed below can be given to the sg_decode_sense utility (which is found  in  this
       package) as follows:

         sg_decode_sense --err=&lt;exit_status&gt;

       and a short explanatory string will be output to stdout.

       The exit status values are:

       <b>0</b>      success. Also used for some utilities that wish to return a boolean value for the "true" case (and
              that no error has occurred). The false case is conveyed by exit status 36.

       <b>1</b>      syntax  error. Either illegal command line options, options with bad arguments or a combination of
              options that is not permitted.

       <b>2</b>      the <u>DEVICE</u> reports that it is not ready for the operation requested.  The <u>DEVICE</u>  may  be  in  the
              process  of  becoming  ready  (e.g.  spinning up but not at speed) so the utility may work after a
              wait. In Linux the <u>DEVICE</u> may be temporarily blocked while error recovery is  taking  place.   See
              exit status values 12 and 13 below which refine this exit value.

       <b>3</b>      the <u>DEVICE</u> reports a medium or hardware error (or a blank check). For example an attempt to read a
              corrupted block on a disk will yield this value.

       <b>5</b>      the  <u>DEVICE</u> reports an "illegal request" with an additional sense code other than "invalid command
              operation code". This is often a supported command with a  field  set  requesting  an  unsupported
              capability.  For  commands  that require a "service action" field this value can indicate that the
              command with that service action value is not supported.

       <b>6</b>      the <u>DEVICE</u> reports a "unit attention" condition. This usually indicates that  something  unrelated
              to  the  requested  command has occurred (e.g. a device reset) potentially before the current SCSI
              command was sent. The requested command has not been  executed  by  the  device.  Note  that  unit
              attention conditions are usually only reported once by a device.

       <b>7</b>      the  <u>DEVICE</u> reports a "data protect" sense key. This implies some mechanism has blocked writes (or
              possibly all access to the media).

       <b>9</b>      the <u>DEVICE</u> reports an illegal request with an additional sense code of "invalid command  operation
              code" which means that it doesn't support the requested command.

       <b>10</b>     the  <u>DEVICE</u> reports a "copy aborted". This implies another command or device problem has stopped a
              copy operation. The EXTENDED COPY family of commands (including WRITE USING TOKEN) may return this
              sense key.

       <b>11</b>     the <u>DEVICE</u> reports an aborted command. In some cases aborted commands can be  retried  immediately
              (e.g. if the transport aborted the command due to congestion).

       <b>12</b>     the <u>DEVICE</u> reports a sense key of not ready together with an additional sense code of "target port
              in standby state".

       <b>13</b>     the <u>DEVICE</u> reports a sense key of not ready together with an additional sense code of "target port
              in unavailable state".

       <b>14</b>     the <u>DEVICE</u> reports a miscompare sense key. VERIFY and COMPARE AND WRITE commands may report this.

       <b>15</b>     the  utility  is  unable to open, close or use the given <u>DEVICE</u> or some other file. The given file
              name could be incorrect or there may be permission problems. Adding the '-v' option may give  more
              information.

       <b>17</b>     a  SCSI "Illegal request" sense code received with a flag indicating the Info field is valid. This
              is often a LBA but its meaning is command specific.

       <b>18</b>     the <u>DEVICE</u> reports a medium or hardware error (or a blank check) with a flag indicating  the  Info
              field  is  valid.  This is often a LBA (of the first encountered error) but its meaning is command
              specific.

       <b>19</b>     the <u>DEVICE</u> reports an illegal request with an additional sense code of "invalid field in parameter
              list". The parameter list is extra data sent to the <u>DEVICE</u> for some commands (e.g. FORMAT UNIT)

       <b>20</b>     the <u>DEVICE</u> reports it has a check condition  but  "no  sense"  and  non-zero  information  in  its
              additional  sense  codes.  Some  polling  commands (e.g. REQUEST SENSE) can receive this response.
              There may be useful information in the sense data such as a progress indication.

       <b>21</b>     the <u>DEVICE</u> reports a "recovered error". The  requested  command  was  successful.  Most  likely  a
              utility will report a recovered error to stderr and continue, probably leaving the utility with an
              exit status of 0 .

       <b>22</b>     the  <u>DEVICE</u> reports that the current command or its parameters imply a logical block address (LBA)
              that is out of range. This happens surprisingly often when trying to access the last  block  on  a
              storage  device;  either  a  classic "off by one" logic error or a misreading of the response from
              READ CAPACITY(10 or 16) in which the address of the last block rather than the number of blocks on
              the <u>DEVICE</u> is returned. Since LBAs are origin zero they range from 0 to n-1 where n is the  number
              of blocks on the <u>DEVICE</u>, so the LBA of the last block is one less than the total number of blocks.

       <b>24</b>     the  <u>DEVICE</u>  reports a SCSI status of "reservation conflict". This means access to the <u>DEVICE</u> with
              the current command has been blocked because another machine (HBA or  SCSI  "initiator")  holds  a
              reservation  on  this  <u>DEVICE</u>. On modern SCSI systems this is related to the use of the PERSISTENT
              RESERVATION family of commands.

       <b>25</b>     the <u>DEVICE</u> reports a SCSI status of "condition met". Currently only  the  PRE-FETCH  command  (see
              SBC-4) yields this status.

       <b>26</b>     the  <u>DEVICE</u>  reports  a  SCSI  status  of "busy". SAM-6 defines this status as the logical unit is
              temporarily unable to process a command. It is recommended to re-issue the command.

       <b>27</b>     the <u>DEVICE</u> reports a SCSI status of "task set full".

       <b>28</b>     the <u>DEVICE</u> reports a SCSI status of "ACA active". ACA  is  "auto  contingent  allegiance"  and  is
              seldom used.

       <b>29</b>     the  <u>DEVICE</u> reports a SCSI status of "task aborted". SAM-5 says: "This status shall be returned if
              a command is aborted by a command or task management function on another I_T nexus and the Control
              mode page TAS bit is set to one".

       <b>31</b>     error involving two or more command line options. They may be contradicting, select an unsupported
              mode, or a required option (given the context) is missing.

       <b>32</b>     there is a logic error in the utility. It corresponds to code comments like  "shouldn't/can't  get
              here". Perhaps the author should be informed.

       <b>33</b>     the command sent to <u>DEVICE</u> has timed out.

       <b>34</b>     this  is  a  Windows only exit status and indicates that the Windows error number (32 bits) cannot
              meaningfully be mapped to an equivalent Unix error number returned as the exit status (7 bits).

       <b>35</b>     a transport error has occurred. This will either be in the driver (e.g.  HBA  driver)  or  in  the
              interconnect between the host (initiator) and the device (target).  For example in SAS an expander
              can run out of paths and thus be unable to return the user data from a READ command.

       <b>36</b>     no error has occurred plus the utility wants to convey a boolean value of false. The corresponding
              true value is conveyed by a 0 exit status.

       <b>40</b>     the  command  sent  to <u>DEVICE</u> has received an "aborted command" sense key with an additional sense
              code of 0x10. This value is related to problems with  protection  information  (PI  or  DIF).  For
              example  this  error  may occur when reading a block on a drive that has never been written (or is
              unmapped) if that drive was formatted with type 1, 2 or 3 protection.

       <b>41</b>     the command sent to <u>DEVICE</u> has received an "aborted command" sense key with  an  additional  sense
              code of 0x10 (as with error code) plus a flag indicating the Info field is valid.

       <b>47</b>     flock (Unix system call) error.

       <b>48</b>     this is an internal message indicating a NVMe status field (SF) is other than zero after a command
              has been executed (i.e. something went wrong).  Work in this area is currently experimental.

       <b>49</b>     low  level  driver  reports a response's residual count (i.e. number of bytes actually received by
              HBA is 'requested_bytes - residual_count') that is nonsensical.

       <b>50</b>     OS system calls that fail often return a small integer number to help. In Unix  these  are  called
              "errno"  values  where  0 implies no error. These error codes set aside 51 to 96 for mapping these
              errno values but that may not be sufficient. Higher errno values that cannot  be  mapped  are  all
              mapped to this value (i.e. 50).
              Note that an errno value of 0 is mapped to error code 0.

       <b>50</b> <b>+</b> <b>&lt;os_error_number&gt;</b>
              OS  system calls that fail often return a small integer number to help indicate what the error is.
              For example in Unix the inability of a system call to allocate memory returns (in 'errno')  ENOMEM
              which often is associated with the integer 12. So 62 (i.e. '50 + 12') may be returned by a utility
              in  this  case. It is also possible that a utility in this package reports 50+ENOMEM when it can't
              allocate memory, not necessarily from an OS system call. In recent  versions  of  Linux  the  file
              showing  the  mapping between symbolic constants (e.g. ENOMEM) and the corresponding integer is in
              the kernel source code file: include/uapi/asm-generic/errno-base.h
              Note that errno values that are greater than or equal to 47 cannot fit in range provided.  Instead
              they are all mapped to 50 as discussed in the previous entry.

       <b>97</b>     a SCSI command response failed sanity checks.

       <b>98</b>     the  <u>DEVICE</u>  reports  it  has  a  check  condition but the error doesn't fit into any of the above
              categories.

       <b>99</b>     any errors that can't be categorized into values 1 to 98  may  yield  this  value.  This  includes
              transport and operating system errors after the command has been sent to the device.

       <b>100-125</b>
              these  error  codes are used by the ddpt utility which uses the sg3_utils library. They are mainly
              specialized error codes associated with offloaded copies.

       <b>126</b>    the utility was found but could not be executed. That might occur if the executable does not  have
              execute permissions.

       <b>127</b>    This  is  the exit status for utility not found. That might occur when a script calls a utility in
              this package but the PATH environment variable has not been properly set up, so the script  cannot
              find the executable.

       <b>128</b> <b>+</b> <b>&lt;signum&gt;</b>
              If  a  signal kills a utility then the exit status is 128 plus the signal number. For example if a
              segmentation fault occurs then a utility is typically killed by SIGSEGV which according to 'man  7
              signal' has an associated signal number of 11; so the exit status will be 139 .

       <b>255</b>    the utility tried to yield an exit status of 255 or larger. That should not happen; given here for
              completeness.

       Most  of  the  error conditions reported above will be repeatable (an example of one that is not is "unit
       attention") so the utility can be run again with the '-v' option (or several) to obtain more information.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well. In the short form an  argument  to  an
       option uses zero or more spaces as a separator (i.e. the short form does not use "=" as a separator).

       If  an  option  takes  a  numeric  argument  then that argument is assumed to be decimal unless otherwise
       indicated (e.g. with a leading "0x", a trailing "h" or as noted in the usage message).

       Some options are used uniformly in most of the utilities in this package. Those options are listed below.
       Note that there are some exceptions.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>
              utilities that can cause lots of user data to be lost or overwritten sometimes  have  a  <u>--dry-run</u>
              option.  Device modifying actions are typically bypassed (or skipped) to implement a policy of "do
              no harm".  This allows complex command line invocations to be tested before  the  action  required
              (e.g.  format  a  disk)  is  performed.  The  <u>--dry-run</u> option has become a common feature of many
              command line utilities (e.g.  the Unix 'patch' command), not just those from this package.
              Note that most hyphenated option names in this package also can be given with an underscore rather
              than a hyphen (e.g.  <u>--dry_run</u>).

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--enumerate</b>
              some utilities (e.g. sg_ses and sg_vpd) store a lot of information in internal tables. This option
              will output that information in some readable form (e.g. sorted by an acronym or by  page  number)
              then exit. Note that with this option <u>DEVICE</u> is ignored (as are most other options) and no SCSI IO
              takes place, so the invoker does not need any elevated permissions.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              output  the usage message then exit. In a few older utilities the '-h' option requests hexadecimal
              output. In these cases the '-?' option will output the usage message then exit.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b>
              for SCSI commands that yield a non-trivial response, print out that response  as  a  series  ASCII
              hexadecimal  bytes.  When  used  once,  16  bytes are printed on each line, prefixed by a relative
              address, starting at 0 (hex). When used twice, an ASCII rendering of the 16 bytes is  appended  to
              each line, with non-printable characters replaced by a '.' . When used three times only the 16 hex
              bytes  are  printed  on  each  line  (hence  no  address  prefix  nor  ASCII appended). To produce
              hexadecimal that can be parsed by other utilities use this option three, four or five times.
              The use of this option, especially when used multiple times has evolved over time as it has become
              more useful (at least in testing and fixing bugs). So  check  this  option's  description  in  the
              manpage  of the utility being used. An example of a corner case with the '-HHH' option is with the
              sg_inq utility and the ATA Information VPD page. The  sg_inq  utility  does  not  decode  the  ATA
              IDENTIFY  DEVICE  command  response  but  instead outputs hexadecimal 16 bit words (little endian)
              suitable for the hdparm utility to decode.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--in</b>=<u>FN</u>
              many SCSI commands fetch a significant amount of data  (returned  in  the  data-in  buffer)  which
              several of these utilities decode (e.g. sg_vpd and sg_logs). To separate the two steps of fetching
              the  data  from  a  SCSI  device  and then decoding it, this option has been added. The first step
              (fetching the data) can be done using the <u>--hex</u> or <u>--raw</u> option and redirecting the  command  line
              output  to  a  file  (often done with "&gt;" in Unix based operating systems). The difference between
              <u>--hex</u> and <u>--raw</u> is that the former produces output in ASCII hexadecimal while <u>--raw</u>  produces  its
              output in "raw" binary.
              The  second  step (i.e. decoding the SCSI response data now held in a file) can be done using this
              <u>--in=FN</u> option where the file name is <u>FN</u>. If "-" is used for <u>FN</u> then stdin is assumed, again  this
              allows  for command line redirection (or piping). That file (or stdin) is assumed to contain ASCII
              hexadecimal unless the <u>--raw</u> option is also given in which case it is assumed to be binary. Notice
              that the meaning of the <u>--raw</u> option is "flipped" when used with <u>--in=FN</u>  to  act  on  the  input,
              typically it acts on the output data.
              Since  the  structure  of  the  data  returned by SCSI commands varies considerably then the usage
              information or the manpage of the utility being used should be checked. In some  cases  <u>--hex</u>  may
              need to be used multiple times (and is more conveniently given as '-HH' or '-HHH).

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--inhex</b>=<u>FN</u>
              This  option  has  the  same  or  similar  functionality  as  <u>--in=FN</u>. And perhaps 'inhex' is more
              descriptive since by default,  ASCII  hexadecimal  is  expected  in  the  contents  of  file:  <u>FN</u>.
              Alternatively  the  short  form  option  may  be  <u>-I</u> or <u>-X</u>. See the "HEX, BINARY AND JSON FORMATS"
              section below for more information.

       <b>--json</b>[=<u>JO</u>]
              The default output of most utilities  that  decode  information  returned  from  SCSI  devices  is
              designed  for human readability. Sometimes a more parseable form of output is required and JSON is
              a popular way to do this. Only utilities that decode a significant amount  of  SCSI  data  support
              this option.
              The  corresponding  short  option is usually <u>-j[JO]</u> but maybe <u>-J[JO]</u> if <u>-j</u> is already in use. Note
              that in all cases <u>JO</u> argument  is  itself  optional.  See  the  sg3_utils_json  manpage  for  more
              information.

       <b>-J</b>, <b>--js-file</b>=<u>JFN</u>
              output  is  in  JSON  format  and  it  is sent to a file named <u>JFN</u>. If that file exists then it is
              truncated. By default, the JSON output is sent to stdout.
              When this option is given,  the  <u>--json[=JO]</u>  option  is  implied  and  need  not  be  given.  The
              <u>--json[=JO]</u> option may still be needed to set the <u>JO</u> parameter to non-default values.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--maxlen</b>=<u>LEN</u>
              several  important  SCSI  commands  (e.g.  INQUIRY and MODE SENSE) have response lengths that vary
              depending on many factors, only some of which these  utilities  take  into  account.  The  maximum
              response length is typically specified in the 'allocation length' field of the cdb. In the absence
              of  this  option,  several utilities use a default allocation length (sometimes recommended in the
              SCSI draft standards) or a "double fetch" strategy.  See  <a href="../man8/sg_logs.8.html">sg_logs</a>(8)  for  its  description  of  a
              "double fetch" strategy. These techniques are imperfect and in the presence of faulty SCSI targets
              can  cause  problems  (e.g.  some  USB  mass  storage  devices  freeze  if they receive an INQUIRY
              allocation length other than 36). Also use of this option disables  any  "double  fetch"  strategy
              that may have otherwise been used.
              To  head off a class of degenerate bugs, if <u>LEN</u> is less than 16 then it is ignored (usually with a
              warning message) and the default value is used instead. Some utilities use 4 (bytes), rather  than
              16, as the cutoff value.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>
              for  SCSI commands that yield a non-trivial response, output that response in binary to stdout. If
              any error messages or warning are produced they are usually sent to stderr so as to not  interfere
              with the output from this option.
              Some  utilities  that  consume  data  to  send to the <u>DEVICE</u> along with the SCSI command, use this
              option. Alternatively the <u>--in=FN</u> option causes <u>DEVICE</u> to be ignored and the response data (to  be
              decoded)  fetched  from  a file named <u>FN</u>. In these cases this option may indicate that binary data
              can be read from stdin or from a nominated file (e.g. <u>FN</u>).

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--timeout</b>=<u>SECS</u>
              utilities that issue potentially long-running SCSI commands often have  a  <u>--timeout=SECS</u>  option.
              This  typically  instructs  the  operating  system  to abort the SCSI command in question once the
              timeout expires. Aborting SCSI commands is typically a messy business and in the  case  of  format
              like  commands  may  leave  the  device in a "format corrupt" state requiring another long-running
              re-initialization command to be sent. The argument, <u>SECS</u>, is usually in seconds and the short form
              of the option may be something other than <u>-t</u> since the timeout option was typically added later as
              storage devices grew in size and initialization commands took longer.  Since  many  utilities  had
              relatively  long  internal  command timeouts before this option was introduced, the actual command
              timeout given to the operating systems is the higher of the internal timeout and <u>SECS</u>.
              Many long running SCSI commands have an IMMED bit in the CDB which causes the  command  to  return
              relatively  quickly  but  the  requested operation has only been commenced, not completed. In such
              cases the REQUEST SENSE command can be used to monitor progress via its progress indication  field
              (see the sg_requests and sg_turs utilities). Utilities that send such SCSI commands either have an
              <u>--immed</u>  option or a <u>--wait</u> option which is the logical inverse of the "immediate" action. Sending
              a SCSI data access command to a device which is busy performing a long running  SCSI  command  (in
              background) will typically receive a NOT READY sense key with an additional sense code of 0x04 and
              a qualifier code which indicates which long running operation the device is performing.
              An alternate long option form is <u>--tmo=SECS</u>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase  the  level  of  verbosity,  (i.e.  debug  output). Can be used multiple times to further
              increase verbosity. The additional output caused by this option is almost always sent to stderr.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print the version string and then exit. Each utility has its own version number and date  of  last
              code change.

</pre><h4><b>NUMERIC</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Many  utilities  have  command  line  options that take numeric arguments. These numeric arguments can be
       large values (e.g. a logical block address (LBA) on a disk) and can  be  inconvenient  to  enter  in  the
       default decimal representation. So various other representations are permitted.

       Multiplicative  suffixes  are accepted. They are one, two or three letter strings appended directly after
       the number to which they apply:

           c C         *1
           w W         *2
           b B         *512
           k K KiB     *1024
           KB kB       *1000
           m M MiB     *1048576
           MB mB       *1000000
           g G GiB     *(2^30)
           GB gB       *(10^9)
           t T TiB     *(2^40)
           TB          *(10^12)
           p P PiB     *(2^50)
           PB          *(10^15)

       An example is "2k" for 2048. The large tera and peta suffixes are only available  for  numeric  arguments
       that might require 64 bits to represent internally.

       These  multiplicative  suffixes are compatible with GNU's dd command (since 2002) which claims compliance
       with SI and with IEC 60027-2.

       A suffix of the form "x&lt;n&gt;" multiplies the preceding number by &lt;n&gt;. An example is "2x33"  for  "66".  The
       left  argument  cannot  be  '0' as '0x' will be interpreted as hexadecimal number prefix (see below). The
       left argument to the multiplication must end in a  hexadecimal  digit  (i.e.   0  to  f)  and  the  whole
       expression cannot have any embedded whitespace (e.g.  spaces). An ugly example: "0xfx0x2" for 30.

       A  suffix  of the form "+&lt;n&gt;" adds the preceding number to &lt;n&gt;. An example is "3+1k" for "1027". The left
       argument to the addition must end in a hexadecimal digit (i.e. 0 to f) and the  whole  expression  cannot
       have any embedded whitespace (e.g. spaces). Another example: "0xf+0x2" for 17.

       Alternatively  numerical arguments can be given in hexadecimal. There are two syntaxes. The number can be
       preceded by either "0x" or  "0X"  as  found  in  the  C  programming  language.  The  second  hexadecimal
       representation  is  a  trailing  "h"  or "H" as found in (storage) standards. When hex numbers are given,
       multipliers cannot be used. For example the decimal value "256" can be given as "0x100" or "100h".

</pre><h4><b>HEX,</b> <b>BINARY</b> <b>AND</b> <b>JSON</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       Both hexadecimal (ASCII) and binary can be used as low  level  output  of  SCSI  responses  that  can  be
       redirected  to  a  file  and  decoded  with  a later invocation. JSON output is typically generated after
       decoding and considered a high level output that may be parsed  by  some  other  tool.  No  utilities  in
       sg3_utils can parse JSON as input.

       JSON output is outlined in its own manpage, see: <a href="../man8/sg3_utils_json.8.html">sg3_utils_json</a>(8).

       Binary  and  especially  hexadecimal  output  can  have  two  roles:  for  viewing immediately (e.g. when
       debugging) or as a parsable output that can be decoded later.  The  latter  action  uses  the  <u>--inhex=FN</u>
       option.  For  viewing hexadecimal output (e.g. from a SCSI command response) the <u>--hex</u> option can be used
       once or twice. Both have output similar to:
           $ hexdump --no-squeezing -C

       When there is a single <u>--hex</u> option, the ASCII rendering to the right of each line  is  not  shown;  when
       used twice the ASCII rendering is shown.
       When  the  <u>--hex</u>  option is used three or more times then the assumption is that it will be parsed later.
       Only hex data bytes are output, up to 16 per line. This is close to this hexdump invocation:
           $ hexdump --no-squeezing -C | cut -s -d ' ' -f 2-19

       This should remove the first column (i.e. the count) and remove the ASCII rendering to  the  right.  This
       makes  parsing  the  hexadecimal a lot easier.  When used 4 or more times the <u>--hex</u> options adds comments
       (i.e.  lines starting with the hash symbol):
           $ sg_logs -HHHH -A /dev/sdc

           # Supported log pages log page  [0x0]:
           00 00 00 03 00 0d 2f

           # Supported log pages and subpages log page  [0x0, 0xff]:
           40 ff 00 0e 00 00 00 ff  0d 00 0d 01 0d ff 2f 00
           2f ff
           ...

       Comments can also be placed after hex in a line, everything from the '#' to the end of a line is ignored.

       There are many examples of hex files suitable for the <u>--inhex=FN</u> option in  the  'inhex'  directory.  The
       naming  of  files  in that directory is the name of the utility that will decode it with the "sg_" prefix
       removed and a ".hex" suffix added. Those hex files can be viewed with a text editor and most  contain  an
       example of invoking it in the leading comments.

       The hexadecimal format can be converted into binary using the sg_decode_sense utility with these options:
       "<u>--inhex=HFN</u>  <u>--nodecode</u>  <u>--write=WFN</u>".  The input (in hex) is in the <u>HFN</u> file while the output is placed
       in the <u>WFN</u> file.

       To convert a binary file into a hexadecimal form  that  can  be  given  as  input  to  various  sg3_utils
       utilities,  the  sg_decode_sense  utility  can  also be used with these options: "<u>--binary=BFN</u> <u>--nodecode</u>
       <u>-HHH</u>" and the hex output will be sent to the console (stdout).

</pre><h4><b>MICROCODE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>FIRMWARE</b></h4><pre>
       There are two standardized methods for downloading microcode (i.e. device firmware) to a SCSI device. The
       more general way is with the SCSI WRITE BUFFER command, see the sg_write_buffer utility. SCSI  enclosures
       have  their  own  method  based  on  the  Download  microcode  control/status  diagnostic  page,  see the
       sg_ses_microcode utility.

</pre><h4><b>SCRIPTS,</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b> <b>and</b> <b>UTILS</b></h4><pre>
       There are several bash shell scripts in the 'scripts' subdirectory that invoke compiled  utilities  (e.g.
       sg_readcap). Several of the scripts start with 'scsi_' rather than 'sg_'. One purpose of these scripts is
       to call the same utility (e.g. sg_readcap) on multiple devices. Most of the basic compiled utilities only
       allow  one  device  as  an argument. Some distributions install these scripts in a more visible directory
       (e.g. <a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>). Some of these scripts have man page entries.  See  the  README  file  in  the  'scripts'
       subdirectory.

       There  is  some example C code plus examples of complex invocations in the 'examples' subdirectory. There
       is also a README file. The example C may be a simpler example of how to use a SCSI pass-through in  Linux
       than  the  main  utilities (found in the 'src' subdirectory). This is due to the fewer abstraction layers
       (e.g. they don't worry the MinGW in Windows may open a file in text rather than binary mode).

       Some utilities that the author has found useful have been placed in the 'utils' subdirectory.

</pre><h4><b>DEBUGGING</b></h4><pre>
       Each utility and most scripts have a <u>--verbose</u> option (short form: <u>-v</u>) that can be used multiple times to
       increase the verbosity of the output to aid debugging. Normal output (if any) is  sent  to  stdout  while
       verbose  output (and error output) is sent to stderr. This may be important when the (normal output) of a
       utility is being piped to another command (e.g. the grep command  to  find  a  particular  field  in  the
       output).

       The  Linux  SCSI  subsystem  has  a  pseudo  file  for  getting  and  changing  the  SCSI  logging level:
       <a href="file:/proc/sys/dev/scsi/logging_level">/proc/sys/dev/scsi/logging_level</a> .  The  scsi_logging_level  script  in  this  package  can  be  used  to
       manipulate the logging level in a command line friendly way. See its manpage.

       The  logging  level  runs  from  0 (no logging and the default) to 7 (lots of logging) and applies to all
       storage devices that use the SCSI subsystem.  The logging output goes to "the log"  which  is  often  the
       <a href="file:/var/log/syslog">/var/log/syslog</a> file.

       The  Linux  SCSI  generic (sg) driver is often used under the utilities in this package. It uses a seldom
       (otherwise) used logging type of SCSI_LOG_TIMEOUT. An example of its use to turn on full debugging is:

           scsi_logging_level -s -T 7

       To reduce the amount of output to only error paths, the following is suggested:

           scsi_logging_level -s -T 3

       And to turn off logging in the sg driver:

           scsi_logging_level -s -T 0

       For analyzing machine crashes associated with a SCSI command, nothing beats a real serial port. By "real"
       means that it is _not_ a USB serial port.  The reason is that like SCSI, USB needs a functioning software
       stack within the OS kernel, the very thing that may be crippled during a machine crash.

       Modern laptops do not have real serial ports and many server machines don't either (or it is an  optional
       extra).  In  Linux the netconsole module does a pretty good job by sending log entries to another machine
       (on the same sub-net)) using the UDP ("fire and forget") network protocol .

</pre><h4><b>WEB</b> <b>SITE</b></h4><pre>
       There is a web page discussing this package at https://sg.danny.cz/sg/sg3_utils.html . The device  naming
       used     by     this     package     on     various     operating     systems     is     discussed    at:
       https://sg.danny.cz/sg/device_name.html     .     There     is     a     git     code      mirror      at
       https://github.com/hreinecke/sg3_utils  .  The  principle  code  repository uses subversion and is on the
       author's equipment. The author keeps track of this  via  the  subversion  revision  number  which  is  an
       ascending  integer  (currently at 922 for this package). The github mirror gets updated periodically from
       the author's repository. Depending on the time of update, the above Downloads section at sg.danny.cz  may
       be more up to date than the github mirror.
