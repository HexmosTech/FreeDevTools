</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       x2goprint - Process X2Go Print Job

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       x2goprint &lt;username&gt; &lt;session_id&gt; &lt;pdf_file&gt; &lt;title_file&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       X2Go print jobs are rendered by the <b>cups-x2go</b> backend on your network's (central) CUPS server and then
       get copied to the X2Go server that the X2Go print job was issued from.

       On that X2Go server <b>cups-x2go</b> places two print job files (a PDF file and a title file) into the home
       directory of the POSIX system user ,,x2goprint'' where they await further processing by <b>x2goprint</b>.

       The <b>x2goprint</b> command on the session's X2Go server (executed by <b>cups-x2go</b> backend) then prepares the job
       files for delivery to the X2Go client-side.

       <b>x2goprint</b> must run with root privileges and is executed by <b>cups-x2go</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>&lt;username&gt;</b>
              The owner of the incoming print jobs is given as the &lt;username&gt; argument.

       <b>&lt;session_id&gt;</b>
              The  &lt;session_id&gt;  is  the  unique  identifier of the X2Go session that the processed print job is
              coming from.

       <b>&lt;pdf_file&gt;</b>
              The filename of the PDF file as dropped into ~x2goprint by <b>cups-x2go</b>.

       <b>&lt;title_file&gt;</b>
              The filename of the title file as dropped into ~x2goprint by <b>cups-x2go</b>.

</pre><h4><b>PERMISSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       X2Go uses the fuse-based SSH filesystem (SSHFS) for transferring print jobs  from  X2Go  server  to  X2Go
       client.  Users that shall use X2Go printing must be members of the X2Go server's ,,fuse'' POSIX group.

</pre><h4><b>X2GO</b> <b>CLUSTER</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       If X2Go server and CUPS server are the same machine, no further setup for X2Go printing is necessary.

       However,  if X2Go server and CUPS server are hosted on separate machines then a special setup of sudo and
       SSH is required on X2Go server(s) and the central CUPS server.

       Refer to https://wiki.x2go.org/installing_x2go_printing_debian_ubuntu for further information.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       By <b>x2goprint</b> nothing is reported on stdout or stderr.

       If <b>x2goprint</b> has run successfully, an exitcode of 0 is returned. If the script has either been called  by
       a non-root user or with the wrong number of command line arguments, a non-zero exitcode is returned.
