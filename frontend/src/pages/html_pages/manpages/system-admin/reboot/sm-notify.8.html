       sm-notify - send reboot notifications to NFS peers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/usr/sbin/sm-notify</b> <b>[-dfn]</b> <b>[-m</b> <u>minutes</u><b>]</b> <b>[-v</b> <u>name</u><b>]</b> <b>[-p</b> <u>notify-port</u><b>]</b> <b>[-P</b> <u>path</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       File locks are not part of persistent file system state.  Lock state is thus lost when a host reboots.

       Network  file systems must also detect when lock state is lost because a remote host has rebooted.  After
       an NFS client reboots, an NFS server must release all file locks held by applications that  were  running
       on  that  client.   After  a  server  reboots,  a  client  must  remind  the server of file locks held by
       applications running on that client.

       For NFS version 2 and version 3, the <u>Network</u> <u>Status</u> <u>Monitor</u> protocol (or NSM for short) is used to notify
       NFS peers of reboots.  On Linux, two separate user-space components constitute the NSM service:

       <b>sm-notify</b>
              A helper program that notifies NFS peers after the local system reboots

       <b>rpc.statd</b>
              A daemon that listens for reboot notifications from other hosts, and manages the list of hosts  to
              be notified when the local system reboots

       The local NFS lock manager alerts its local <b>rpc.statd</b> of each remote peer that should be monitored.  When
       the  local  system  reboots,  the  <b>sm-notify</b>  command  notifies the NSM service on monitored peers of the
       reboot.  When a remote reboots, that peer notifies the local <b>rpc.statd</b>, which in turn passes  the  reboot
       notification back to the local NFS lock manager.

</pre><h4><b>NSM</b> <b>OPERATION</b> <b>IN</b> <b>DETAIL</b></h4><pre>
       The  first file locking interaction between an NFS client and server causes the NFS lock managers on both
       peers to contact their local NSM service to store information about the opposite  peer.   On  Linux,  the
       local lock manager contacts <b>rpc.statd</b>.

       <b>rpc.statd</b>  records  information  about  each  monitored NFS peer on persistent storage.  This information
       describes how to contact a remote peer in case the local system reboots, how to recognize which monitored
       peer is reporting a reboot, and how to notify the local lock manager when a monitored peer  indicates  it
       has rebooted.

       An  NFS  client  sends  a hostname, known as the client's <u>caller_name</u>, in each file lock request.  An NFS
       server can use this hostname to send asynchronous GRANT calls to a client, or to notify the client it has
       rebooted.

       The Linux NFS server can provide the client's <u>caller_name</u> or the client's network address  to  <b>rpc.statd</b>.
       For the purposes of the NSM protocol, this name or address is known as the monitored peer's <u>mon_name</u>.  In
       addition, the local lock manager tells <b>rpc.statd</b> what it thinks its own hostname is.  For the purposes of
       the NSM protocol, this hostname is known as <u>my_name</u>.

       There  is  no  equivalent  interaction  between  an  NFS  server and a client to inform the client of the
       server's <u>caller_name</u>.  Therefore NFS clients do not actually know what <u>mon_name</u> an NFS server  might  use
       in an SM_NOTIFY request.  The Linux NFS client records the server's hostname used on the mount command to
       identify rebooting NFS servers.

   <b>Reboot</b> <b>notification</b>
       When  the  local  system reboots, the <b>sm-notify</b> command reads the list of monitored peers from persistent
       storage and sends an SM_NOTIFY request to the NSM service on  each  listed  remote  peer.   It  uses  the
       <u>mon_name</u>  string as the destination.  To identify which host has rebooted, the <b>sm-notify</b> command normally
       sends <u>my_name</u> string recorded when that remote was monitored.   The  remote  <b>rpc.statd</b>  matches  incoming
       SM_NOTIFY  requests  using  this string, or the caller's network address, to one or more peers on its own
       monitor list.

       If <b>rpc.statd</b> does not find a peer on its monitor list that matches an  incoming  SM_NOTIFY  request,  the
       notification  is  not  forwarded to the local lock manager.  In addition, each peer has its own <u>NSM</u> <u>state</u>
       <u>number</u>, a 32-bit integer that is bumped after each reboot by the <b>sm-notify</b> command.  <b>rpc.statd</b> uses  this
       number to distinguish between actual reboots and replayed notifications.

       Part of NFS lock recovery is rediscovering which peers need to be monitored again.  The <b>sm-notify</b> command
       clears the monitor list on persistent storage after each reboot.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b>     Keeps  <b>sm-notify</b>  attached  to  its  controlling  terminal  and  running in the foreground so that
              notification progress may be monitored directly.

       <b>-f</b>     Send notifications even if <b>sm-notify</b> has already run since the last system reboot.

       <b>-m</b> <u>retry-time</u>
              Specifies the length of time, in minutes,  to  continue  retrying  notifications  to  unresponsive
              hosts.   If this option is not specified, <b>sm-notify</b> attempts to send notifications for 15 minutes.
              Specifying a value of 0 causes <b>sm-notify</b> to continue sending notifications to  unresponsive  peers
              until it is manually killed.

              Notifications  are retried if sending fails, the remote does not respond, the remote's NSM service
              is not registered, or if there is a DNS failure which prevents the remote's  <u>mon_name</u>  from  being
              resolved to an address.

              Hosts  are not removed from the notification list until a valid reply has been received.  However,
              the SM_NOTIFY procedure has a void result.  There is no way for <b>sm-notify</b> to tell  if  the  remote
              recognized the sender and has started appropriate lock recovery.

       <b>-n</b>     Prevents <b>sm-notify</b> from updating the local system's NSM state number.

       <b>-p</b> <u>port</u>
              Specifies  the source port number <b>sm-notify</b> should use when sending reboot notifications.  If this
              option is not specified, a randomly chosen ephemeral port is used.

              This option can be used to traverse a firewall between client and server.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--state-directory-path</b> <u>pathname</u>
              Specifies the pathname of the parent directory where  NSM  state  information  resides.   If  this
              option is not specified, <b>sm-notify</b> uses <u>/var/lib/nfs</u> by default.

              After  starting, <b>sm-notify</b> attempts to set its effective UID and GID to the owner and group of the
              subdirectory <b>sm</b> of this directory.  After changing the effective  ids,  <b>sm-notify</b>  only  needs  to
              access files in <b>sm</b> and <b>sm.bak</b> within the state-directory-path.

       <b>-v</b> <u>ipaddr</u> <b>|</b> <u>hostname</u>
              Specifies  the  network address from which to send reboot notifications, and the <u>mon_name</u> argument
              to use when sending SM_NOTIFY requests.  If  this  option  is  not  specified,  <b>sm-notify</b>  uses  a
              wildcard  address as the transport bind address, and uses the <u>my_name</u> recorded when the remote was
              monitored as the <u>mon_name</u> argument when sending SM_NOTIFY requests.

              The <u>ipaddr</u> form can be expressed as either an IPv4 or an IPv6 presentation address.  If the <u>ipaddr</u>
              form is used, the <b>sm-notify</b> command converts this address to a hostname for use  as  the  <u>mon_name</u>
              argument when sending SM_NOTIFY requests.

              This  option  can  be  useful in multi-homed configurations where the remote requires notification
              from a specific network address.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Many of the options that can be set on the command line can also be controlled through values set in  the
       <b>[sm-notify]</b> or, in one case, the <b>[statd]</b> section of the <u>/etc/nfs.conf</u> configuration file.

       Values  recognized  in  the  <b>[sm-notify]</b>  section  include: <b>retry-time</b>, <b>outgoing-port</b>, and <b>outgoing-addr</b>.
       These have the same effect as the command line options <b>m</b>, <b>p</b>, and <b>v</b> respectively.

       An additional value recognized in the <b>[sm-notify]</b> section is <b>lift-grace</b>.  By default, <b>sm-notify</b> will lift
       lockd's grace period early if it has no hosts to notify.  Some high availability configurations will  run
       one  <b>sm-notify</b>  per  floating  IP  address.   In these configurations, lifting the grace period early may
       prevent clients from reclaiming locks.  Setting <b>lift-grace</b> to <b>n</b> will prevent <b>sm-notify</b>  from  ending  the
       grace period early.  <b>lift-grace</b> has no corresponding command line option.

       The value recognized in the <b>[statd]</b> section is <b>state-directory-path</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sm-notify</b>  command  must  be  started  as  root  to  acquire  privileges  needed to access the state
       information database.  It drops root privileges as soon as it starts up to reduce the risk of a privilege
       escalation attack.

       During normal operation, the effective user ID it chooses is the owner  of  the  state  directory.   This
       allows  it  to  continue  to access files in that directory after it has dropped its root privileges.  To
       control which user ID <b>rpc.statd</b> chooses, simply use <b><a href="../man1/chown.1.html">chown</a></b>(1) to set the owner of the state directory.

</pre><h4><b>ADDITIONAL</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Lock recovery after a reboot is  critical  to  maintaining  data  integrity  and  preventing  unnecessary
       application hangs.

       To  help  <b>rpc.statd</b>  match  SM_NOTIFY  requests  to  NLM  requests,  a number of best practices should be
       observed, including:

              The UTS nodename of your systems should match the DNS names that NFS peers use to contact them

              The UTS nodenames of your systems should always be fully qualified domain names

              The forward and reverse DNS mapping of the UTS nodenames should be consistent

              The hostname the client uses to mount the server should match the server's <u>mon_name</u>  in  SM_NOTIFY
              requests it sends

       Unmounting  an  NFS file system does not necessarily stop either the NFS client or server from monitoring
       each other.  Both may continue monitoring each other for a time in case subsequent  NFS  traffic  between
       the two results in fresh mounts and additional file locking.

       On  Linux,  if  the  <b>lockd</b>  kernel  module  is unloaded during normal operation, all remote NFS peers are
       unmonitored.  This can happen on an NFS client, for example, if an  automounter  removes  all  NFS  mount
       points due to inactivity.

   <b>IPv6</b> <b>and</b> <b>TI-RPC</b> <b>support</b>
       TI-RPC  is  a  pre-requisite  for  supporting NFS on IPv6.  If TI-RPC support is built into the <b>sm-notify</b>
       command ,it will choose an appropriate IPv4 or IPv6 transport based on the network  address  returned  by
       DNS  for  each remote peer.  It should be fully compatible with remote systems that do not support TI-RPC
       or IPv6.

       Currently, the <b>sm-notify</b> command supports sending notification only via datagram transport protocols.
