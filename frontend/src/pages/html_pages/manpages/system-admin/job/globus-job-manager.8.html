</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>globus-job-manager</b> program is a servivce which starts and controls GRAM jobs which are executed by a
       local resource management system, such as LSF or Condor. The <b>globus-job-manager</b> program is typically
       started by the <b>globus-gatekeeper</b> program and not directly by a user. It runs until all jobs it is
       managing have terminated or its delegated credentials have expired.

       Typically, users interact with the <b>globus-job-manager</b> program via client applications such as <b>globusrun</b>,
       <b>globus-job-submit</b>, or tools such as CoG jglobus or Condor-G.

       The full set of command-line options to <b>globus-job-manager</b> consists of:

       <b>-help</b>
           Display a help message to standard error and exit

       <b>-type</b> <u>LRM</u>
           Execute jobs using the local resource manager named <u>LRM</u>.

       <b>-conf</b> <u>CONFIG_PATH</u>
           Read additional command-line arguments from the file <u>CONFIG_PATH</u>. If present, this must be the first
           command-line argument to the <b>globus-job-manager</b> program.

       <b>-globus-host-manufacturer</b> <u>MANUFACTURER</u>
           Indicate the manufacturer of the system which the jobs will execute on. This parameter sets the value
           of the $(GLOBUS_HOST_MANUFACTURER) RSL substitution to <u>MANUFACTURER</u>

       <b>-globus-host-cputype</b> <u>CPUTYPE</u>
           Indicate the CPU type of the system which the jobs will execute on. This parameter sets the value of
           the $(GLOBUS_HOST_CPUTYPE) RSL substitution to <u>CPUTYPE</u>

       <b>-globus-host-osname</b> <u>OSNAME</u>
           Indicate the operating system type of the system which the jobs will execute on. This parameter sets
           the value of the $(GLOBUS_HOST_OSNAME) RSL substitution to <u>OSNAME</u>

       <b>-globus-host-osversion</b> <u>OSVERSION</u>
           Indicate the operating system version of the system which the jobs will execute on. This parameter
           sets the value of the $(GLOBUS_HOST_OSVERSION) RSL substitution to <u>OSVERSION</u>

       <b>-globus-gatekeeper-host</b> <u>HOST</u>
           Indicate the host name of the machine which the job was submitted to. This parameter sets the value
           of the $(GLOBUS_GATEKEEPER_HOST) RSL substitution to <u>HOST</u>

       <b>-globus-gatekeeper-port</b> <u>PORT</u>
           Indicate the TCP port number of gatekeeper to which jobs are submitted to. This parameter sets the
           value of the $(GLOBUS_GATEKEEPER_PORT) RSL substitution to <u>PORT</u>

       <b>-globus-gatekeeper-subject</b> <u>SUBJECT</u>
           Indicate the X.509 identity of the gatekeeper to which jobs are submitted to. This parameter sets the
           value of the $(GLOBUS_GATEKEEPER_SUBJECT) RSL substitution to <u>SUBJECT</u>

       <b>-home</b> <u>GLOBUS_LOCATION</u>
           Indicate the path where the Grid Community Toolkit(r) is installed on the service node. This is used
           by the job manager to locate its support and configuration files.

       <b>-target-globus-location</b> <u>TARGET_GLOBUS_LOCATION</u>
           Indicate the path where the Grid Community Toolkit(r) is installed on the execution host. If this is
           omitted, the value specified as a parameter to <u>-home</u> is used. This parameter sets the value of the
           $(GLOBUS_LOCATION) RSL substitution to <u>TARGET_GLOBUS_LOCATION</u>

       <b>-history</b> <u>HISTORY_DIRECTORY</u>
           Configure the job manager to write job history files to <u>HISTORY_DIRECTORY</u>. These files are described
           in the FILES section below.

       <b>-scratch-dir-base</b> <u>SCRATCH_DIRECTORY</u>
           Configure the job manager to use <u>SCRATCH_DIRECTORY</u> as the default scratch directory root if a
           relative path is specified in the job RSL’s scratch_dir attribute.

       <b>-enable-syslog</b>
           Configure the job manager to write log messages via syslog. Logging is further controlled by the
           argument to the <u>-log-levels</u> parameter described below.

       <b>-log-pattern</b> <u>PATTERN</u>
           Configure the job manager to write log messages to files named by the string <u>PATTERN</u>. The <u>PATTERN</u>
           string may contain job-independent RSL substitutions such as $(HOME), $(LOGNAME), etc, as well as the
           special RSL substition $(DATE) which will be resolved at log time to the date in YYYYMMDD form.

       <b>-stdio-log</b> <u>LOG_DIRECTORY</u>
           Configure the job manager to write log messages to files in the <u>LOG_DIRECTORY</u> directory. This is a
           backward-compatible parameter, equivalent to '-log-pattern '.

       <b>-log-levels</b> <u>LEVELS</u>
           Configure the job manager to write log messages of certain levels to syslog and/or log files. The
           available log levels are FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, and TRACE. Multiple values can be combined
           with the | character. The default value of logging when enabled is FATAL|ERROR.

       <b>-state-file-dir</b> <u>STATE_DIRECTORY</u>
           Configure the job manager to write state files to <u>STATE_DIRECTORY</u>. If not specified, the job manager
           uses the default of $GLOBUS_LOCATION/tmp/gram_job_state/. This directory must be writable by all
           users and be on a file system which supports POSIX advisory file locks. . This directory must be
           writable by all users and be on a file system which supports POSIX advisory file locks.

       <b>-globus-tcp-port-range</b> <u>PORT_RANGE</u>
           Configure the job manager to restrict its TCP/IP communication to use ports in the range described by
           <u>PORT_RANGE</u>. This value is also made available in the job environment via the GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE
           environment variable.

       <b>-globus-tcp-source-range</b> <u>SOURCE_RANGE</u>
           Configure the job manager to restrict its TCP/IP communication to use source ports in the range
           described by <u>SOURCE_RANGE</u>. This value is also made available in the job environment via the
           GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE environment variable.

       <b>-x509-cert-dir</b> <u>TRUSTED_CERTIFICATE_DIRECTORY</u>
           Configure the job manager to search <u>TRUSTED_CERTIFICATE_DIRECTORY</u> for its list of trusted CA
           certificates and their signing policies. This value is also made available in the job environment via
           the X509_CERT_DIR environment variable.

       <b>-cache-location</b> <u>GASS_CACHE_DIRECTORY</u>
           Configure the job manager to use the path <u>GASS_CACHE_DIRECTORY</u> for its temporary GASS-cache files.
           This value is also made available in the job environment via the GLOBUS_GASS_CACHE_DEFAULT
           environment variable.

       <b>-k</b>
           Configure the job manager to assume it is using Kerberos for authentication instead of X.509
           certificates. This disables some certificate-specific processing in the job manager.

       <b>-extra-envvars</b> <u>VAR=VAL,...</u>
           Configure the job manager to define a set of environment variables in the job environment beyond
           those defined in the base job environment. The format of the parameter to this argument is a
           comma-separated sequence of VAR=VAL pairs, where VAR is the variable name and VAL is the variable’s
           value. If the value is not specified, then the value of the variable in the job manager’s environment
           is used. This option may be present multiple times on the command-line or the job manager
           configuration file to append multiple environment settings.

       <b>-seg-module</b> <u>SEG_MODULE</u>
           Configure the job manager to use the schedule event generator module named by <u>SEG_MODULE</u> to detect
           job state changes events from the local resource manager, in place of the less efficient polling
           operations used in GT2. To use this, one instance of the <b>globus-job-manager-event-generator</b> must be
           running to process events for the LRM into a generic format that the job manager can parse.

       <b>-audit-directory</b> <u>AUDIT_DIRECTORY</u>
           Configure the job manager to write audit records to the directory named by <u>AUDIT_DIRECTORY</u>. This
           records can be loaded into a database using the <b>globus-gram-audit</b> program.

       <b>-globus-toolkit-version</b> <u>TOOLKIT_VERSION</u>
           Configure the job manager to use <u>TOOLKIT_VERSION</u> as the version for audit and usage stats records.

       <b>-service-tag</b> <u>SERVICE_TAG</u>
           Configure the job manager to use <u>SERVICE_TAG</u> as a unique identifier to allow multiple GRAM instances
           to use the same job state directories without interfering with each other’s jobs. If not set, the
           value untagged will be used.

       <b>-disable-streaming</b>
           Configure the job manager to disable file streaming. This is propagated to the LRM script interface
           but has no effect in GRAM5.

       <b>-condor-arch</b> <u>ARCH</u>
           Set the architecture specification for condor jobs to be <u>ARCH</u> in job classified ads generated by the
           GRAM5 codnor LRM script. This is required for the condor LRM but ignored for all others.

       <b>-condor-os</b> <u>OS</u>
           Set the operating system specification for condor jobs to be <u>OS</u> in job classified ads generated by
           the GRAM5 codnor LRM script. This is required for the condor LRM but ignored for all others.
