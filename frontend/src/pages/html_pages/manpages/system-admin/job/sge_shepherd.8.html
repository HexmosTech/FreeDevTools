</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sge_shepherd - Grid Engine single job-controlling agent

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sge_shepherd</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>sge_shepherd</u>  provides  the  parent  process  functionality  for  a  single  Grid Engine job.  The parent
       functionality is necessary on UNIX systems to retrieve  resource  usage  information  (see  <u><a href="../man2/getrusage.2.html">getrusage</a></u>(2))
       after a job has finished. In addition, the <u>sge_shepherd</u> forwards signals to the job, such for suspension,
       enabling,  termination,  and  the Grid Engine checkpointing signal (see <u><a href="../man1/sge_ckpt.1.html">sge_ckpt</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5) for
       details).

       The <u>sge_shepherd</u> receives information about the job to be started  from  the  <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8).   During  the
       execution  of  the  job  it actually starts up to 5 child processes. First a prolog script is run if this
       feature is enabled by the <b>prolog</b> parameter in the  cluster  configuration.  (See  <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5).)   Next  a
       parallel  environment  startup  procedure  is  run  if the job is a parallel job. (See <u><a href="../man5/sge_pe.5.html">sge_pe</a></u>(5) for more
       information.)  After that, the job itself is run, followed by a parallel environment  shutdown  procedure
       for  parallel  jobs,  and  finally  an  epilog script if requested by the <b>epilog</b> parameter in the cluster
       configuration. The prolog and epilog scripts, as well as the parallel environment  startup  and  shutdown
       procedures,  are  to  be  provided  by  the  Grid Engine administrator and are intended for site-specific
       actions to be taken before and after execution of the actual user job.

       After the job has finished and the epilog script is  processed,  <u>sge_shepherd</u>  retrieves  resource  usage
       statistics  about the job, places them in a job-specific subdirectory of the <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) spool directory
       for reporting through <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8), and finishes.

       <u>sge_shepherd</u> also places an exit status file in the spool directory. This exit status can be viewed  with
       qacct -j JobId (see <u><a href="../man1/qacct.1.html">qacct</a></u>(1)); it is not the exit status of <u>sge_shepherd</u> itself but of one of the methods
       executed  by  <u>sge_shepherd.</u>  This exit status can have several meanings, depending on the method in which
       an error occurred (if any).  The possible methods  are:  prolog,  parallel  start,  job,  parallel  stop,
       epilog, suspend, restart, terminate, clean, migrate, and checkpoint.

       The following exit values are returned:

       0      All methods: Operation was executed successfully.

       99     Job  script,  prolog  and  epilog:  When  <u>FORBID_RESCHEDULE</u>  is  not set in the configuration (see
              <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5)), the job gets re-queued.  Otherwise see "Other".

       100    Job script, prolog and  epilog:  When  <u>FORBID_APPERROR</u>  is  not  set  in  the  configuration  (see
              <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5)), the job gets re-queued.  Otherwise see "Other".

       Other  Job  script:  This  is the exit status of the job itself. No action is taken upon this exit status
              because the meaning of this exit status is not known.
              Prolog, epilog and parallel start: The queue is set to error state and the job is re-queued.
              Parallel stop: The queue is set to error state, but the job is not re-queued. It is  assumed  that
              the job itself ran successfully and only the clean up script failed.
              Suspend, restart, terminate, clean, and migrate: Always successful.
              Checkpoint:  Success,  except  for  kernel  checkpointing:  checkpoint was not successful, did not
              happen (but migration will happen).

       For the meaning of the return codes of the shepherd  itself  (which  are  interpreted  by  <u><a href="../man1/qacct.1.html">qacct</a></u>(1))  see
       <u><a href="../man5/sge_status.5.html">sge_status</a></u>(5).

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>sge_shepherd</u> should not be invoked manually, but only by <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SGE_ROOT</b>       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard configuration files.

       <b>SGE_CELL</b>       If  set,  specifies  the default Grid Engine cell. To address a Grid Engine cell <u>sge_execd</u>
                      uses (in the order of precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. <b>default</b>.

       <b>SGE_ENABLE_COREDUMP</b>
                      If set, enable core dumps on Linux when  the  admin_user  is  not  root.   Linux  normally
                      disables  core  dumps when the daemon has changed uid or gid.  Setting SGE_ENABLE_COREDUMP
                      in sge_execd's environment defeats that to enable core dumps for  debugging  if  they  are
                      otherwise allowed.  This is typically not a big hazard with SGE, since most information is
                      exposed in the spool area anyhow.  Dumps will appear in the qmaster spool directory, which
                      need not be world-readable.
                      On Solaris, <u><a href="../man1/coreadm.1.html">coreadm</a></u>(1) may be used to enable such dumps.

       <b>SGE_CGROUP_DIR</b> If  Linux  cgroups  handling  is enabled, this variable names a directory under the cgroup
                      mount point in which to create job-specific directories.  The default is <b>sge.</b><u>SGE_CELL</u>  so,
                      for instance, the cpuset cgroup for a job might be <b>/sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/sge.default/123</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sgepasswd</b>  contains  a  list of user names and their corresponding encrypted passwords. If available, the
       password file will be used by <b>sge_shepherd.</b> <b>To</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>file</b> <b>please</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b>  <b>sgepasswd</b>
       <b>command.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>advised</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> <b>file</b> <b>manually.</b>
       <u>&lt;execd_spool&gt;/job_dir/&lt;job_id&gt;</u>     job specific directory
       <u>&lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/common/sgepasswd</u>
                                          Password information used on Microsoft Windows hosts.  See
       <u><a href="../man5/sgepasswd.5.html">sgepasswd</a></u>(5).
