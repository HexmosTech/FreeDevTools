</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       polkit - Authorization Manager

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       polkit provides an authorization API intended to be used by privileged programs (“MECHANISMS”) offering
       service to unprivileged programs (“SUBJECTS”) often through some form of inter-process communication
       mechanism. In this scenario, the mechanism typically treats the subject as untrusted. For every request
       from a subject, the mechanism needs to determine if the request is authorized or if it should refuse to
       service the subject. Using the polkit APIs, a mechanism can offload this decision to a trusted party: The
       polkit authority.

       The polkit authority is implemented as an system daemon, <b><a href="../man8/polkitd.8.html">polkitd</a></b>(8), which itself has little privilege as
       it is running as the <u>polkitd</u> system user. Mechanisms, subjects and authentication agents communicate with
       the authority using the system message bus.

       In addition to acting as an authority, polkit allows users to obtain temporary authorization through
       authenticating either an administrative user or the owner of the session the client belongs to. This is
       useful for scenarios where a mechanism needs to verify that the operator of the system really is the user
       or really is an administrative user.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>ARCHITECTURE</b></h4><pre>
       The system architecture of polkit is comprised of the <u>Authority</u> (implemented as a service on the system
       message bus) and an <u>Authentication</u> <u>Agent</u> per user session (provided and started by the user's graphical
       environment).  <u>Actions</u> are defined by applications. Vendors, sites and system administrators can control
       authorization policy through <u>Authorization</u> <u>Rules</u>.

       For convenience, the libpolkit-gobject-1 library wraps the polkit D-Bus API and is usable from any C/C++
       program as well as higher-level languages supporting <b>GObjectIntrospection</b>[2] such as JavaScript and
       Python. A mechanism can also use the D-Bus API or the <b><a href="../man1/pkcheck.1.html">pkcheck</a></b>(1) command to check authorizations. The
       libpolkit-agent-1 library provides an abstraction of the native authentication system, e.g.  <b><a href="../man8/pam.8.html">pam</a></b>(8) and
       also facilities for registration and communication with the polkit D-Bus service.

       See the <b>developer</b> <b>documentation</b>[3] for more information about writing polkit applications.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHENTICATION</b> <b>AGENTS</b></h4><pre>
       An authentication agent is used to make the user of a session prove that the user of the session really
       is the user (by authenticating as the user) or an administrative user (by authenticating as an
       administrator). In order to integrate well with the rest of the user session (e.g. match the look and
       feel), authentication agents are meant to be provided by the user session that the user uses. For
       example, an authentication agent may look like this:

       If the system is configured without a <u>root</u> account, it may prompt for a specific user designated as the
       administrative user:

       Applications that do not run under a desktop environment (for example, if launched from an <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) login)
       may not have an authentication agent associated with them. Such applications may use the
       PolkitAgentTextListener type or the <b><a href="../man1/pkttyagent.1.html">pkttyagent</a></b>(1) helper so the user can authenticate using a textual
       interface.

</pre><h4><b>DECLARING</b> <b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A mechanism needs to declare a set of <u>actions</u> in order to use polkit. Actions correspond to operations
       that clients can request the mechanism to carry out and are defined in XML files that the mechanism
       installs into the <a href="file:/usr/share/polkit-1/actions">/usr/share/polkit-1/actions</a> directory.

       polkit actions are namespaced and can only contain the characters "[A-Z][a-z][0-9].-", e.g. ASCII,
       digits, period and hyphen. Each XML file can contain more than one action but all actions need to be in
       the same namespace and the file needs to be named after the namespace and have the extension .policy.

       The XML file must have the following doctype declaration

           &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
           &lt;!DOCTYPE policyconfig PUBLIC "-//freedesktop//DTD polkit Policy Configuration 1.0//EN"
           "<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/policyconfig-1.dtd">http://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/policyconfig-1.dtd</a>"&gt;

       The <u>policyconfig</u> element must be present exactly once. Elements that can be used inside <u>policyconfig</u>
       includes:

       <u>vendor</u>
           The name of the project or vendor that is supplying the actions in the XML document. Optional.

       <u>vendor_url</u>
           A URL to the project or vendor that is supplying the actions in the XML document. Optional.

       <u>icon_name</u>
           An icon representing the project or vendor that is supplying the actions in the XML document. The
           icon name must adhere to the <b>Freedesktop.org</b> <b>Icon</b> <b>Naming</b> <b>Specification</b>[6]. Optional.

       <u>action</u>
           Declares an action. The action name is specified using the id attribute and can only contain the
           characters "[A-Z][a-z][0-9].- ", e.g. ASCII, digits, period and hyphen.

       Elements that can be used inside <u>action</u> include:

       <u>description</u>
           A human readable description of the action, e.g.  “Install unsigned software”.

       <u>message</u>
           A human readable message displayed to the user when asking for credentials when authentication is
           needed, e.g.  “Installing unsigned software requires authentication”.

       <u>defaults</u>
           This element is used to specify implicit authorizations for clients. Elements that can be used inside
           <u>defaults</u> include:

           <u>allow_any</u>
               Implicit authorizations that apply to any client. Optional.

           <u>allow_inactive</u>
               Implicit authorizations that apply to clients in inactive sessions on local consoles. Optional.

           <u>allow_active</u>
               Implicit authorizations that apply to clients in active sessions on local consoles. Optional.

           Each of the <u>allow_any</u>, <u>allow_inactive</u> and <u>allow_active</u> elements can contain the following values:

           no
               Not authorized.

           yes
               Authorized.

           auth_self
               Authentication by the owner of the session that the client originates from is required. Note that
               this is not restrictive enough for most uses on multi-user systems; auth_admin* is generally
               recommended.

           auth_admin
               Authentication by an administrative user is required.

           auth_self_keep
               Like auth_self but the authorization is kept for a brief period (e.g. five minutes). The warning
               about auth_self above applies likewise.

           auth_admin_keep
               Like auth_admin but the authorization is kept for a brief period (e.g. five minutes).

       <u>annotate</u>
           Used for annotating an action with a key/value pair. The key is specified using the key attribute and
           the value is specified using the value attribute. This element may appear zero or more times. See
           below for known annotations.

       <u>vendor</u>
           Used for overriding the vendor on a per-action basis. Optional.

       <u>vendor_url</u>
           Used for overriding the vendor URL on a per-action basis. Optional.

       <u>icon_name</u>
           Used for overriding the icon name on a per-action basis. Optional.

       For localization, <u>description</u> and <u>message</u> elements may occur multiple times with different xml:lang
       attributes.

       To list installed polkit actions, use the <b><a href="../man1/pkaction.1.html">pkaction</a></b>(1) command.

   <b>Known</b> <b>annotations</b>
       The org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.path annotation is used by the <b>pkexec</b> program shipped with polkit -
       see the <b><a href="../man1/pkexec.1.html">pkexec</a></b>(1) man page for details.

       The org.freedesktop.policykit.imply annotation (its value is a string containing a space-separated list
       of action identifiers) can be used to define <u>meta</u> <u>actions</u>. The way it works is that if a subject is
       authorized for an action with this annotation, then it is also authorized for any action specified by the
       annotation. A typical use of this annotation is when defining an UI shell with a single lock button that
       should unlock multiple actions from distinct mechanisms.

       The org.freedesktop.policykit.owner annotation can be used to define a set of users who can query whether
       a client is authorized to perform this action. If this annotation is not specified, then only root can
       query whether a client running as a different user is authorized for an action. The value of this
       annotation is a string containing a space-separated list of PolkitIdentity entries, for example
       "unix-user:42 unix-user:colord". A typical use of this annotation is for a daemon process that runs as a
       system user rather than root.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORIZATION</b> <b>RULES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>polkitd</b> reads .rules files from the following directories in this order:

       •   <a href="file:/etc/polkit-1/rules.d">/etc/polkit-1/rules.d</a>

       •   /run/polkit-1/rules.d

       •   /usr/local/share/polkit-1/rules.d

       •   <a href="file:/usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d">/usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d</a>

       These directories are processed in lexical order based on the basename of each file. If there's a tie,
       files in directories earlier in the list are processed first. For example, for the following four files,
       the order is:

       •   /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/10-auth.rules

       •   /run/polkit-1/rules.d/10-auth.rules

       •   /usr/local/share/polkit-1/rules.d/10-auth.rules

       •   /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/10-auth.rules

       All of these directories are monitored, so if a rules file is changed, added, or removed, existing rules
       are purged and all files are read and processed again. Rules files are written in the <b>JavaScript</b>[7]
       programming language and interface with <b>polkitd</b> through the global polkit object (of type <b>Polkit</b>).

       While the JavaScript interpreter used in particular versions of polkit may support non-standard features
       (such as the <u>let</u> keyword), authorization rules must conform to <b>ECMA-262</b> <b>edition</b> <b>5</b>[8] (in other words, the
       JavaScript interpreter used may change in future versions of polkit).

       Authorization rules are intended for two specific audiences

       •   System Administrators

       •   Special-purpose Operating Systems / Environments

       and those audiences only. In particular, applications, mechanisms and general-purpose operating systems
       must never include any authorization rules.

   <b>The</b> <b>Polkit</b> <b>type</b>
       The following methods are available on the polkit object:

       <b>void</b> <b>addRule(polkit.Result</b> <b>function(</b><u>action</u><b>,</b> <u>subject</u><b>)</b> <b>{...});</b>

       <b>void</b> <b>addAdminRule(string[]</b> <b>function(</b><u>action</u><b>,</b> <u>subject</u><b>)</b> <b>{...});</b>

       <b>void</b> <b>log(string</b> <u>message</u><b>);</b>

       <b>string</b> <b>spawn(string[]</b> <u>argv</u><b>);</b>

       The <b>addRule()</b> method is used for adding a function that may be called whenever an authorization check for
       <u>action</u> and <u>subject</u> is performed. Functions are called in the order they have been added until one of the
       functions returns a value. Hence, to add an authorization rule that is processed before other rules, put
       it in a file in <a href="file:/etc/polkit-1/rules.d">/etc/polkit-1/rules.d</a> with a name that sorts before other rules files, for example
       00-early-checks.rules. Each function should return a value from polkit.Result

           polkit.Result = {
               NO              : "no",
               YES             : "yes",
               AUTH_SELF       : "auth_self",
               AUTH_SELF_KEEP  : "auth_self_keep",
               AUTH_ADMIN      : "auth_admin",
               AUTH_ADMIN_KEEP : "auth_admin_keep",
               NOT_HANDLED     : null
           };

       corresponding to the values that can be used as defaults. If the function returns
       <b>polkit.Result.NOT_HANDLED</b>, <b>null</b>, <b>undefined</b> or does not return a value at all, the next user function is
       tried.

       Keep in mind that if <b>polkit.Result.AUTH_SELF_KEEP</b> or <b>polkit.Result.AUTH_ADMIN_KEEP</b> is returned,
       authorization checks for the same action identifier and subject will succeed (that is, return
       <b>polkit.Result.YES</b>) for the next brief period (e.g. five minutes) <u>even</u> if the variables passed along with
       the check are different. Therefore, if the result of an authorization rule depend on such variables, it
       should not use the <b>"*_KEEP"</b> constants (if similar functionality is required, the authorization rule can
       easily implement temporary authorizations using the <b>Date</b>[9] type for timestamps).

       The <b>addAdminRule()</b> method is used for adding a function that may be called whenever administrator
       authentication is required. The function is used to specify what identities may be used for administrator
       authentication for the authorization check identified by <u>action</u> and <u>subject</u>. Functions added are called
       in the order they have been added until one of the functions returns a value. Each function should return
       an array of strings where each string is of the form "unix-group:&lt;group&gt;", "unix-netgroup:&lt;netgroup&gt;" or
       "unix-user:&lt;user&gt;". If the function returns <b>null</b>, <b>undefined</b> or does not return a value at all, the next
       function is tried.

       There is no guarantee that a function registered with <b>addRule()</b> or <b>addAdminRule()</b> is ever called - for
       example an early rules file could register a function that always returns a value, hence ensuring that
       functions added later are never called.

       If user-provided code takes a long time to execute, no exception will be thrown and the script will be
       killed right away (the current limit is 15 seconds). This is used to catch runaway scripts.

       The <b>spawn()</b> method spawns an external helper identified by the argument vector <u>argv</u> and waits for it to
       terminate. If an error occurs or the helper doesn't exit normally with exit code 0, an exception is
       thrown. If the helper does not exit within 10 seconds, it is killed. Otherwise, the program's <u>standard</u>
       <u>output</u> is returned as a string. The <b>spawn()</b> method should be used sparingly as helpers may take a very
       long or indeterminate amount of time to complete and no other authorization check can be handled while
       the helper is running. Note that the spawned programs will run as the unprivileged <u>polkitd</u> system user.

       The <b>log()</b> method writes the given <u>message</u> to the system logger prefixed with the JavaScript filename and
       line number. Log entries are emitted using the <b>LOG_AUTHPRIV</b> flag meaning that the log entries usually
       ends up in the file /var/log/secure. The <b>log()</b> method is usually only used when debugging rules. The
       <b>Action</b> and <b>Subject</b> types has suitable <b>toString()</b> methods defined for easy logging, for example,

           polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
               if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.policykit.exec") {
                   polkit.log("action=" + action);
                   polkit.log("subject=" + subject);
               }
           });

       will produce the following when the user runs 'pkexec -u bateman bash -i' from a shell:

           May 24 14:28:50 thinkpad polkitd[32217]: /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/10-test.rules:3: action=[Action id='org.freedesktop.policykit.exec' command_line='<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?bash">/usr/bin/bash</a> -i' program='<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?bash">/usr/bin/bash</a>' user='bateman' user.gecos='Patrick Bateman' user.display='Patrick Bateman (bateman)']
           May 24 14:28:50 thinkpad polkitd[32217]: /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/10-test.rules:4: subject=[Subject pid=1352 user='davidz' groups=davidz,wheel, seat='seat0' session='1' local=true active=true]

   <b>The</b> <b>Action</b> <b>type</b>
       The <u>action</u> parameter passed to user functions is an object with information about the action being
       checked. It is of type <b>Action</b> and has the following attribute:

       <b>string</b> id
           The action identifier, for example <u>org.freedesktop.policykit.exec</u>.

       The following methods are available on the <b>Action</b> type:

       <b>string</b> <b>lookup(string</b> <u>key</u><b>);</b>

       The <b>lookup()</b> method is used to lookup the polkit variables passed from the mechanism. For example, the
       <b><a href="../man1/pkexec.1.html">pkexec</a></b>(1) mechanism sets the variable <u>program</u> which can be obtained in JavaScript using the expression
       action.lookup("program"). If there is no value for the given <u>key</u>, then <b>undefined</b> is returned.

       Consult the documentation for each mechanism for what variables are available for each action.

   <b>The</b> <b>Subject</b> <b>type</b>
       The <u>subject</u> parameter passed to user functions is an object with information about the process being
       checked. It is of type <b>Subject</b> and has the following attributes

       <b>int</b> pid
           The process id.

       <b>string</b> user
           The user name.

       <b>string[]</b> groups
           Array of groups that <u>user</u> user belongs to.

       <b>string</b> seat
           The seat that the subject is associated with - blank if not on a local seat.

       <b>string</b> session
           The session that the subject is associated with.

       <b>string</b> system_unit
           The systemd unit that the subject's process is part of (if any). Note that this can only match on
           system units, as user units can be created with any name without privileges (unlike system units
           which require root to create). A process running in a user unit will return the user session unit in
           this attribute (e.g.: user-1000.service).

       <b>boolean</b> local
           Set to <b>true</b> only if seat is local.

       <b>boolean</b> no_new_privileges
           Set only if <u>system_unit</u> is not empty, and set to <b>true</b> only if the referenced systemd service unit has
           the <u>NoNewPrivileges=</u> setting enabled. This ensures that the process cannot gain any new privileges
           via executing setuid binaries.

       <b>boolean</b> active
           Set to <b>true</b> only if the session is active.

       The following methods are available on the <b>Subject</b> type:

       <b>boolean</b> <b>isInGroup(string</b> <u>groupName</u><b>);</b>

       <b>boolean</b> <b>isInNetGroup(string</b> <u>netGroupName</u><b>);</b>

       The <b>isInGroup()</b> method can be used to check if the subject is in a given group and <b>isInNetGroup()</b> can be
       used to check if the subject is in a given netgroup.

   <b>Authorization</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>Examples</b>
       Allow all users in the admin group to perform user administration without changing policy for other
       users:

           polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
               if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.accounts.user-administration" &amp;&amp;
                   subject.isInGroup("admin")) {
                   return polkit.Result.YES;
               }
           });

       Define administrative users to be the users in the wheel group:

           polkit.addAdminRule(function(action, subject) {
               return ["unix-group:wheel"];
           });

       Forbid users in group children to change hostname configuration (that is, any action with an identifier
       starting with org.freedesktop.hostname1.) and allow anyone else to do it after authenticating as
       themselves:

           polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
               if (action.id.indexOf("org.freedesktop.hostname1.") == 0) {
                   if (subject.isInGroup("children")) {
                       return polkit.Result.NO;
                   } else {
                       return polkit.Result.AUTH_SELF_KEEP;
                   }
               }
           });

       Run an external helper to determine if the current user may reboot the system:

           polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
               if (action.id.indexOf("org.freedesktop.login1.reboot") == 0) {
                   try {
                       // user-may-reboot exits with success (exit code 0)
                       // only if the passed username is authorized
                       polkit.spawn(["/opt/company/bin/user-may-reboot",
                                     subject.user]);
                       return polkit.Result.YES;
                   } catch (error) {
                       // Nope, but do allow admin authentication
                       return polkit.Result.AUTH_ADMIN;
                   }
               }
           });

       The following example shows how the authorization decision can depend on variables passed by the
       <b><a href="../man1/pkexec.1.html">pkexec</a></b>(1) mechanism:

           polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
               if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.policykit.exec" &amp;&amp;
                   action.lookup("program") == "<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?cat">/usr/bin/cat</a>") {
                   return polkit.Result.AUTH_ADMIN;
               }
           });

       The following example shows another use of variables passed from the mechanism. In this case, the
       mechanism is <b>UDisks</b>[10] which defines a set of <b>actions</b> <b>and</b> <b>variables</b>[11] that is used to match on:

           // Allow users in group 'engineers' to perform any operation on
           // some drives without having to authenticate
           //
           polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
               if (action.id.indexOf("org.freedesktop.udisks2.") == 0 &amp;&amp;
                   action.lookup("drive.vendor") == "SEAGATE" &amp;&amp;
                   action.lookup("drive.model") == "ST3300657SS" &amp;&amp;
                   subject.isInGroup("engineers")) {
                       return polkit.Result.YES;
                   }
               }
           });

       Allow all processes running as part of the admin.service systemd system unit to perform user
       administration, as long as they cannot gain new privileges:

           polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
               if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.accounts.user-administration" &amp;&amp;
                   subject.system_unit == "admin.service" &amp;&amp;
                   subject.no_new_privileges) {
                   return polkit.Result.YES;
               }
           });
