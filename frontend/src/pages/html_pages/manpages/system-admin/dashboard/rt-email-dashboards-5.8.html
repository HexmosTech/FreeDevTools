</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rt-email-dashboards - Send email dashboards

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           rt-email-dashboards [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This tool will send users email based on how they have subscribed to dashboards. A dashboard is a set of
       saved searches, the subscription controls how often that dashboard is sent and how it's displayed.

       Each subscription has an hour, and possibly day of week or day of month. These are taken to be in the
       user's timezone if available, UTC otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>SETUP</b></h4><pre>
       You'll need to have cron run this script every hour. Here's an example crontab entry to do this.

           0 * * * * /usr/sbin/rt-email-dashboards

       This will run the script every hour on the hour. This may need some further tweaking to be run as the
       correct user.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This tool supports a few options. Most are for debugging.

       -h
       --help  Display this documentation

       --dryrun
               Figure out which dashboards would be sent, but don't actually generate or email any of them

       --dashboards DASHBOARD_IDS
               Only check specified dashboards(comma-separated IDs).

       --time SECONDS
               Instead  of  using  the  current  time to figure out which dashboards should be sent, use SECONDS
               (usually since midnight Jan 1st, 1970, so 1192216018 would be Oct 12 19:06:58 GMT 2007).

       --epoch SECONDS
               Backwards-compatible for --time SECONDS.

       --all   Ignore subscription frequency when considering each dashboard (should only be used with  --dryrun
               for testing and debugging)

       --user User NAME or ID
               Only check the specified user's subscriptions

       --recipient User NAME or EMAIL or ID
               Only  send emails to the specified user. Can be specified multiple times to send multiple emails,
               e.g.

                   --recipient <a href="mailto:alice@example.com">alice@example.com</a> --recipient <a href="mailto:bob@example.com">bob@example.com</a>

               This is mostly useful for testing, especially dashboard issues seen only by a specific user.  For
               typical dashboard emails, set recipients via the subscription settings in the web UI.

       --log LEVEL
               Adjust LogToSTDERR config option

       --statement-log LEVEL
               Log  any SQL queries produced at the specified log level. This works similar to the $StatementLog
               option in the main RT config file.
