</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       backup_jobs - Lists pending and running operations in interactive mode

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jobs</b> [<b>-help</b>]

       <b>j</b> [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>backup</b> <b>jobs</b> command lists the job ID number and status of each <b>backup</b> operation running or pending in
       the current interactive session.

       This command can be issued in interactive mode only. If the issuer of the <b>backup</b> <b>interactive</b> command
       included the <b>-localauth</b> flag, the <b>-cell</b> argument, or both, those settings apply to this command also.

       To terminate operations that appear in the output, issue the <b>backup</b> <b>kill</b> command and identify the
       operation to cancel with the job ID number from this command's output.

       To check the status of a Tape Coordinator, rather than of a certain operation, use the <b>backup</b> <b>status</b>
       command.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The output always includes the expiration date and time of the tokens that the <b>backup</b> command interpreter
       is using during the current interactive session, in the following format:

          &lt;date&gt;   &lt;time&gt;: TOKEN EXPIRATION

       If  the  execution date and time specified for a scheduled dump operation is later than &lt;date time&gt;, then
       its individual line (as described in the following paragraphs) appears below this line to  indicate  that
       the current tokens will not be available to it.

       If the issuer of the backup command included the <b>-localauth</b> flag when entering interactive mode, the line
       instead reads as follows:

          :  TOKEN NEVER EXPIRES

       The entry for a scheduled dump operation has the following format:

          Job &lt;job_ID&gt;:  &lt;timestamp&gt;:  dump  &lt;volume_set&gt;  &lt;dump_level&gt;

       where

       &lt;job_ID&gt;
           Is a job identification number assigned by the Backup System.

       &lt;timestamp&gt;
           Indicates  the  date  and  time  the  dump  operation  is  to  begin,  in  the format <u>month</u>/<u>date</u>/<u>year</u>
           <u>hours</u>:<u>minutes</u> (in 24-hour format)

       &lt;volume_set&gt;
           Indicates the volume set to dump.

       &lt;dump_level&gt;
           Indicates the dump level at which to perform the dump operation.

       The line for a pending or running operation of any other type has the following format:

          Job &lt;job_ID&gt;:  &lt;operation&gt;  &lt;status&gt;

       where

       &lt;job_ID&gt;
           Is a job identification number assigned by the Backup System.

       &lt;operation&gt;
           Identifies the operation the Tape Coordinator is performing, which  is  initiated  by  the  indicated
           command:

           Dump (<u>dump</u> <u>name</u>)
               Initiated by the backup dump command. The <u>dump</u> <u>name</u> has the following format:

                   &lt;volume_set_name&gt;.&lt;dump_level_name&gt;

           Restore
               Initiated by the <b>backup</b> <b>diskrestore</b>, <b>backup</b> <b>volrestore</b>, or <b>backup</b> <b>volsetrestore</b> command.

           Labeltape (<u>tape_label</u>)
               Initiated  by  the  <b>backup</b> <b>labeltape</b>n command. The <u>tape_label</u> is the name specified by the <b>backup</b>
               <b>labeltape</b> command's <b>-name</b> or <b>-pname</b> argument.

           Scantape
               Initiated by the <b>backup</b> <b>scantape</b> command.

           SaveDb
               Initiated by the <b>backup</b> <b>savedb</b> command.

           RestoreDb
               Initiated by the <b>backup</b> <b>restoredb</b> command.

       &lt;status&gt;
           Indicates the job's current status in one of the following messages. If no message appears,  the  job
           is either still pending or has finished.

           <u>number</u> Kbytes, volume <u>volume_name</u>
               For  a  running dump operation, indicates the number of kilobytes copied to tape or a backup data
               file so far, and the volume currently being dumped.

           <u>number</u> Kbytes, restore.volume
               For a running restore operation, indicates the number of kilobytes copied into AFS from a tape or
               a backup data file so far.

           [abort requested]
               The <b>backup</b> <b>kill</b> command was issued, but  the  termination  signal  has  yet  to  reach  the  Tape
               Coordinator.

           [abort sent]
               The  operation  is  canceled  by  the  <b>backup</b>  <b>kill</b>  command.   Once the Backup System removes an
               operation from the queue or stops it from running, it no longer appears at all in the output from
               the command.

           [butc contact lost]
               The backup command interpreter cannot reach the Tape Coordinator. The  message  can  mean  either
               that the Tape Coordinator handling the operation was terminated or failed while the operation was
               running, or that the connection to the Tape Coordinator timed out.

           [done]
               The Tape Coordinator has finished the operation.

           [drive wait]
               The operation is waiting for the specified tape drive to become free.

           [operator wait]
               The Tape Coordinator is waiting for the backup operator to insert a tape in the drive.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following example shows that two restore operations and one dump operation are running (presumably on
       different  Tape Coordinators) and that the <b>backup</b> command interpreter's tokens expire on 22 April 1999 at
       10:45 am:

          backup&gt; jobs
          Job 1: Restore, 1306 Kbytes, restore.volume
          Job 2: Dump (user.sunday1), 34 Kbytes, volume user.pat.backup
          Job 3: Restore, 2498 Kbytes, restore.volume
                 04/22/1999 10:45: TOKEN EXPIRATION

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>REQUIRED</b></h4><pre>
       None. However, queuing any operation requires privilege, and it is possible to issue  this  command  only
       within the interactive session in which the jobs are queued.
