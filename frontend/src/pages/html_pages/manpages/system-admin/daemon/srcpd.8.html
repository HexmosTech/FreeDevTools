</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       srcpd - SRCP speaking daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>srcpd</b> [ options ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is not a complete manual. You have to consult the project home page at <a href="http://srcpd.sourceforge.net/">http://srcpd.sourceforge.net/</a>
       for full documentation!

       <b>srcpd</b> is a UNIX daemon speaking the Simple Railroad Command Protocol (SRCP).

       Upon  start up it reads in the system wide configuration file named <b>srcpd.conf</b>. Contents and structure of
       this XML-file is explained in detail in the <b>srcpd.conf</b> <b>(5)</b> man page. The SRCP specification is  published
       on <a href="http://srcpd.sourceforge.net/srcp">http://srcpd.sourceforge.net/srcp</a>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Prints some useful help about command line options and exit

       <b>-n</b>     Do not daemonize upon start-up. The srcpd does not switch into background mode. This option can be
              used with the Ubuntu upstart system.

       <b>-v</b>     Print program version, SRCP level and exit

       <b>-f</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Use the specified filename as the configuration file. The default value will be defined at compile
              time and can be displayed using the <b>-h</b> parameter.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Getting</b> <b>started</b>
       The   <b>srcpd</b>   system   service   (daemon)  is  compliant  to  the  Filesystem  Hierarchy  Standard  (FHS,
       <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">http://www.pathname.com/fhs/</a>). For more information and special options about daemon usage  please  refer
       to to your system documentation. The following instructions are on a general level of information.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Please  first start assembling a configuration file (<u>srcpd.conf</u>) fitting exactly your needs to connect to
       your model railway controller interface. Save this  file  to  the  directory  for  host  specific  system
       configuration (<u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u>). The default configuration file delivered with this software must be replaced by the
       new one.

       As  soon  as  the  adapted configuration file is at the right place, the daemon can be started using this
       command:

              /etc/init.d/srcpd start

       If the <b>srcpd</b> is already running, the daemon first must be stopped to get  it  aware  of  the  new  setup.
       Stopping the daemon is executed in analogy to the start command:

              /etc/init.d/srcpd stop

       Under  certain  conditions  it  is also possible to get the daemon re-read its configuration file without
       stopping it. With respect to hardware access rules under UNIXlike systems, the group and/or  user  rights
       must  be  properly  set  in <u>srcpd.conf</u> to let the daemon access the appropriate hardware resources at any
       time.

       Common model railway interfaces will require access rights for serial lines (RS232, USB),  which  can  be
       achieved  using the proper group rights (e.g. <b>dialout</b>). The <b>ddl-s88</b> module uses a special system function
       (ioperm) which always needs root rights to perform successfully. The ioperm() function is typically  only
       available  on  x86 and x86-64 hardware. So if you are using other hardware and get an error about missing
       <u>sys/io.h</u> while compiling srcpd source code, just disable the ddl-s88 module. Refer to ./configure  --help
       for more details about how to disable special srcpd modules.

       To let srcpd re-read its configuration file, assumed the setup mentioned before is correct, the following
       command can be used:

              /etc/init.d/srcpd reload

       The  log  file <u>/var/log/messages</u> or <u><a href="file:/var/log/syslog">/var/log/syslog</a></u> of the syslog daemon can be used to monitor occurring
       errors on daemon start or during current operation.  With  root  rights  the  upcoming  messages  can  be
       continuously watched in a separate terminal:

              tail -f /var/log/messages

       or

              tail -f <a href="file:/var/log/syslog">/var/log/syslog</a>

       The  verbosity  of  these  messages  can  be  adjusted  using the configuration file <u>srcpd.conf</u>. For more
       information refer to the adequate man page.
