       thermald - start Linux thermal daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>thermald</b>  [ <u>OPTIONS</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>thermald</b> is a Linux daemon used to prevent the overheating of platforms. This daemon monitors temperature
       and applies compensation using available cooling methods.

       By default, it monitors CPU temperature using available CPU digital temperature sensors and maintains CPU
       temperature under control, before HW takes aggressive correction action.

       Thermal  daemon  looks  for  thermal  sensors  and  thermal  cooling  drivers  in the Linux thermal sysfs
       (<a href="file:/sys/class/thermal">/sys/class/thermal</a>) and builds a list of sensors and cooling drivers. Each of the  thermal  sensors  can
       optionally  be binded to a cooling driver by the in kernel drivers. In this case the Linux kernel thermal
       core can directly take actions based on the temperature trip  points,  for  each  sensor  and  associated
       cooling  device.  For  example  a trip temperature X in a sensor can be associates a cooling driver Y. So
       when the sensor temperature = X, the cooling driver "Y" is activated.

       Thermal daemon allows one to change this relationship or add new one via  a  thermal  configuration  file
       (thermal-conf.xml).  This file is automatically created (thermal-conf.xml.auto) and used, if the platform
       has ACPI thermal relationship table.  If not this needs to be manually configured.

       For manual configuration refer to the manual page of the thermal-conf.xml.

       In some newer platforms the auto creation of the config file is done by a  companion  tool  "dptfxtract".
       This  tool  can be downloaded from "https://github.com/intel/dptfxtract". It is suggested as parts of the
       install process, run dptfxtract.

       There can be multiple configuration files. User can select a configuration file via  -config-file  option
       to override the default selection. The default selection picks one of the file in the following order:

       - /etc/thermald/thermal-conf.xml.auto

       - /var/run/thermald/thermal-conf.xml.auto

       - /etc/thermald/thermal-conf.xml

       (*Assuming configure prefix=/ is used during build.)

       There  is  another companion tool "ThermalMonitor", which presents a graphical front end. This allows the
       monitoring of sensors and changing of thermal trips to give the user more control.  The  source  code  of
       "ThermalMonitor" is a part of the thermald github source, in the tools folder.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show help options.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print thermald version and exit.

       <b>--no-daemon</b>
              Don't become a daemon: Default is daemon mode.

       <b>--loglevel=info</b>
              log severity: info level and up.

       <b>--loglevel=debug</b>
              log severity: debug level and up: Max logging.

       <b>--poll-interval</b>
              Poll  interval  in  seconds:  Poll for zone temperature changes.  To disable polling, set to zero.
              Polling can only be disabled, if available  temperature  sensors  can  notify  temperature  change
              asynchronously.

       <b>--dbus-enable</b>
              Enable Dbus.

       <b>--exclusive-control</b>
              Act  as exclusive thermal controller. This will use user-space governor for thermal sysfs and take
              over control.

       <b>--ignore-cpuid-check</b>
              Ignore cpuid check for supported CPU models.

       <b>--config-file</b>
              Specify thermal-conf.xml path and ignore default thermal-conf.xml.

       <b>--ignore-default-control</b>
              Ignore default CPU temperature control. Strictly follow thermal-conf.xml or thermal-conf.xml.auto.

       <b>--workaround-enabled</b>
              Enable special workarounds for RAPL MMIO power limit and TCC offset every 30 seconds.  This  helps
              to disable RAPL MMIO when not used and adjust TCC offset in certain Lenovo laptops.

       <b>--disable-active-power</b>
              Disable  active  power management. This will not set active power limits using RAPL MMIO. This may
              result in constrained performance, if the system boots up with lower power limits.

       <b>--adaptive</b>
              Use DPTF adaptive tables when present. This will ignore thermald config via xml files.

       <b>--test-mode</b>
              Force use adaptive mode and exit if not supported, instead of restarting  in  non  adaptive  mode.
              This option is primarily for developers.

       <b>--systemd</b>
              Assume  that  thermald  is started by systemd. This will prevent running as daemon irrespective of
              --no-daemon option.

       <b>--ignore-critical-trip</b>
              If the configuration defined a critical temperature point, which is  too  low,  this  option  will
              avoid shutting down the system on reaching this temperature limit.
