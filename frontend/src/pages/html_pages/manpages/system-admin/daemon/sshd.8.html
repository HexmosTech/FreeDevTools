       sshd — OpenSSH daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sshd</b>  [<b>-46DdeGiqTtV</b>]  [<b>-C</b>  <u>connection_spec</u>]  [<b>-c</b>  <u>host_certificate_file</u>]  [<b>-E</b>  <u>log_file</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>config_file</u>]
            [<b>-g</b> <u>login_grace_time</u>] [<b>-h</b> <u>host_key_file</u>] [<b>-o</b> <u>option</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>port</u>] [<b>-u</b> <u>len</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sshd</b> (OpenSSH Daemon) is the daemon program for <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).   It  provides  secure  encrypted  communications
       between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.

       <b>sshd</b>  listens  for  connections  from  clients.  It is normally started at boot from <u><a href="file:/etc/init.d/ssh">/etc/init.d/ssh</a></u>.  It
       forks a new daemon for each incoming connection.  The forked daemons  handle  key  exchange,  encryption,
       authentication, command execution, and data exchange.

       <b>sshd</b>  can  be  configured using command-line options or a configuration file (by default <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5));
       command-line options override values specified in the configuration file.  <b>sshd</b> rereads its configuration
       file when it receives a hangup signal, SIGHUP, by executing itself with  the  name  and  options  it  was
       started with, e.g. <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?sshd">/usr/sbin/sshd</a></u>.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-4</b>      Forces <b>sshd</b> to use IPv4 addresses only.

       <b>-6</b>      Forces <b>sshd</b> to use IPv6 addresses only.

       <b>-C</b> <u>connection_spec</u>
               Specify  the  connection parameters to use for the <b>-T</b> extended test mode.  If provided, any <b>Match</b>
               directives in the configuration file that would apply are applied  before  the  configuration  is
               written  to  standard  output.  The connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs and
               may be supplied in any order, either with multiple <b>-C</b> options or as a comma-separated list.   The
               keywords  are  “addr”,  “user”,  “host”, “laddr”, “lport”, and “rdomain” and correspond to source
               address, user, resolved source host name, local address, local port  number  and  routing  domain
               respectively.  Additionally the “invalid-user” flag (which does not take a value argument) may be
               specified to simulate a connection from an unrecognised username.

       <b>-c</b> <u>host_certificate_file</u>
               Specifies  a  path  to  a certificate file to identify <b>sshd</b> during key exchange.  The certificate
               file must match a host key file specified using  the  <b>-h</b>  option  or  the  <b>HostKey</b>  configuration
               directive.

       <b>-D</b>      When  this  option  is specified, <b>sshd</b> will not detach and does not become a daemon.  This allows
               easy monitoring of <b>sshd</b>.

       <b>-d</b>      Debug mode.  The server sends verbose debug output to standard error, and does not put itself  in
               the  background.   The  server  also will not <u><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></u>(2) and will only process one connection.  This
               option is only intended for debugging for the server.  Multiple <b>-d</b> options increase the debugging
               level.  Maximum is 3.

       <b>-E</b> <u>log_file</u>
               Append debug logs to <u>log_file</u> instead of the system log.

       <b>-e</b>      Write debug logs to standard error instead of the system log.

       <b>-f</b> <u>config_file</u>
               Specifies the name of the configuration file.  The default is <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/sshd_config">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</a></u>.  <b>sshd</b> refuses
               to start if there is no configuration file.

       <b>-G</b>      Parse and print configuration file.  Check the validity of the  configuration  file,  output  the
               effective  configuration  to  stdout  and  then  exit.  Optionally, <b>Match</b> rules may be applied by
               specifying the connection parameters using one or more <b>-C</b> options.

       <b>-g</b> <u>login_grace_time</u>
               Gives the grace time for clients to authenticate themselves (default 120 seconds).  If the client
               fails to authenticate the user within this many seconds, the server  disconnects  and  exits.   A
               value of zero indicates no limit.

       <b>-h</b> <u>host_key_file</u>
               Specifies  a file from which a host key is read.  This option must be given if <b>sshd</b> is not run as
               root (as the normal host key files are normally not readable by anyone but root).  The default is
               <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key</a></u>, <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key</a></u>.  It  is
               possible to have multiple host key files for the different host key algorithms.

       <b>-i</b>      Specifies that <b>sshd</b> is being run from <u><a href="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd</a></u>(8).

       <b>-o</b> <u>option</u>
               Can  be  used  to  give options in the format used in the configuration file.  This is useful for
               specifying options for which there is no separate command-line flag.  For  full  details  of  the
               options, and their values, see <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5).

       <b>-p</b> <u>port</u>
               Specifies  the  port  on  which  the  server listens for connections (default 22).  Multiple port
               options are permitted.  Ports specified in the  configuration  file  with  the  <b>Port</b>  option  are
               ignored  when  a  command-line port is specified.  Ports specified using the <b>ListenAddress</b> option
               override command-line ports.

       <b>-q</b>      Quiet mode.  Nothing is sent to the system log.   Normally  the  beginning,  authentication,  and
               termination of each connection is logged.

       <b>-T</b>      Extended  test  mode.   Check  the  validity  of  the  configuration  file,  output the effective
               configuration to stdout and then exit.  Optionally, <b>Match</b> rules may be applied by specifying  the
               connection  parameters  using  one  or  more  <b>-C</b> options.  This is similar to the <b>-G</b> flag, but it
               includes the additional testing performed by the <b>-t</b> flag.

       <b>-t</b>      Test mode.  Only check the validity of the configuration file and sanity of the  keys.   This  is
               useful for updating <b>sshd</b> reliably as configuration options may change.

       <b>-u</b> <u>len</u>  This  option is used to specify the size of the field in the <u>utmp</u> structure that holds the remote
               host name.  If the resolved host name is longer than <u>len</u>, the dotted decimal value will  be  used
               instead.   This  allows  hosts  with  very  long  host names that overflow this field to still be
               uniquely identified.  Specifying <b>-u0</b> indicates that only dotted decimal addresses should  be  put
               into  the  <u>utmp</u>  file.   <b>-u0</b> may also be used to prevent <b>sshd</b> from making DNS requests unless the
               authentication mechanism or  configuration  requires  it.   Authentication  mechanisms  that  may
               require DNS include <b>HostbasedAuthentication</b> and using a <b>from="pattern-list"</b> option in a key file.
               Configuration  options  that  require  DNS  include  using  a  USER@HOST pattern in <b>AllowUsers</b> or
               <b>DenyUsers</b>.

       <b>-V</b>      Display the version number and exit.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHENTICATION</b></h4><pre>
       The OpenSSH SSH daemon supports SSH protocol 2 only.  Each host has a host-specific key, used to identify
       the host.  Whenever a client connects, the daemon responds with its public host key.  The client compares
       the host key against its own database to verify that it has not changed.   Forward  secrecy  is  provided
       through a Diffie-Hellman key agreement.  This key agreement results in a shared session key.  The rest of
       the  session  is  encrypted using a symmetric cipher.  The client selects the encryption algorithm to use
       from those offered by the server.  Additionally, session integrity is provided  through  a  cryptographic
       message authentication code (MAC).

       Finally,  the  server  and  the  client enter an authentication dialog.  The client tries to authenticate
       itself using host-based authentication, public key authentication, challenge-response authentication,  or
       password authentication.

       Regardless  of  the  authentication  type,  the  account  is checked to ensure that it is accessible.  An
       account is not accessible if it is locked, listed in <b>DenyUsers</b> or its group is  listed  in  <b>DenyGroups</b>  .
       The  definition  of  a locked account is system dependent. Some platforms have their own account database
       (eg AIX) and some modify the passwd field ( ‘*LK*’ on Solaris and  UnixWare,  ‘*’  on  HP-UX,  containing
       ‘Nologin’  on  Tru64,  a leading ‘*LOCKED*’ on FreeBSD and a leading ‘!’ on most Linuxes).  If there is a
       requirement to disable password authentication for the account while allowing still public-key, then  the
       passwd field should be set to something other than these values (eg ‘NP’ or ‘*NP*’ ).

       If  the client successfully authenticates itself, a dialog for preparing the session is entered.  At this
       time the client may request things like allocating a pseudo-tty, forwarding X11  connections,  forwarding
       TCP connections, or forwarding the authentication agent connection over the secure channel.

       After  this,  the  client either requests an interactive shell or execution of a non-interactive command,
       which <b>sshd</b> will execute via the user's shell using its <b>-c</b> option.  The sides then enter session mode.  In
       this mode, either side may send data at any time, and such data is forwarded to/from the shell or command
       on the server side, and the user terminal in the client side.

       When the user program terminates and all forwarded X11 and other connections have been closed, the server
       sends command exit status to the client, and both sides exit.

</pre><h4><b>LOGIN</b> <b>PROCESS</b></h4><pre>
       When a user successfully logs in, <b>sshd</b> does the following:

             1.   If the login is on a tty, and no command has  been  specified,  prints  last  login  time  and
                  <u>/etc/motd</u>  (unless  prevented  in  the  configuration file or by <u><a href="file:~/.hushlogin">~/.hushlogin</a></u>; see the “FILES”
                  section).

             2.   If the login is on a tty, records login time.

             3.   Checks <u>/etc/nologin</u>; if it exists, prints contents and quits (unless root).

             4.   Changes to run with normal user privileges.

             5.   Sets up basic environment.

             6.   Reads the file <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/environment">~/.ssh/environment</a></u>, if it  exists,  and  users  are  allowed  to  change  their
                  environment.  See the <b>PermitUserEnvironment</b> option in <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5).

             7.   Changes to user's home directory.

             8.   If  <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/rc">~/.ssh/rc</a></u>  exists  and  the  <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5)  <b>PermitUserRC</b>  option is set, runs it; else if
                  <u>/etc/ssh/sshrc</u> exists, runs it; otherwise runs <u><a href="../man1/xauth.1.html">xauth</a></u>(1).  The “rc” files  are  given  the  X11
                  authentication protocol and cookie in standard input.  See “SSHRC”, below.

             9.   Runs  user's shell or command.  All commands are run under the user's login shell as specified
                  in the system password database.

</pre><h4><b>SSHRC</b></h4><pre>
       If the file <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/rc">~/.ssh/rc</a></u> exists, <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1) runs it after reading the environment files but before  starting  the
       user's  shell or command.  It must not produce any output on stdout; stderr must be used instead.  If X11
       forwarding is in use, it will receive the "proto cookie" pair in its standard input (and DISPLAY  in  its
       environment).   The  script  must  call <u><a href="../man1/xauth.1.html">xauth</a></u>(1) because <b>sshd</b> will not run xauth automatically to add X11
       cookies.

       The primary purpose of this file is to run any initialization routines which may  be  needed  before  the
       user's home directory becomes accessible; AFS is a particular example of such an environment.

       This file will probably contain some initialization code followed by something similar to:

          if read proto cookie &amp;&amp; [ -n "$DISPLAY" ]; then
                  if [ `echo $DISPLAY | cut -c1-10` = 'localhost:' ]; then
                          # X11UseLocalhost=yes
                          echo add unix:`echo $DISPLAY |
                              cut -c11-` $proto $cookie
                  else
                          # X11UseLocalhost=no
                          echo add $DISPLAY $proto $cookie
                  fi | xauth -q -
          fi

       If  this  file does not exist, <u>/etc/ssh/sshrc</u> is run, and if that does not exist either, xauth is used to
       add the cookie.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORIZED_KEYS</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AuthorizedKeysFile</b> specifies the files containing public keys for  public  key  authentication;  if  this
       option is not specified, the default is <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a></u> and <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys2">~/.ssh/authorized_keys2</a></u>.  Each line of
       the  file  contains  one key (empty lines and lines starting with a ‘#’ are ignored as comments).  Public
       keys consist of the following space-separated fields: options, keytype, base64-encoded key, comment.  The
       options field is optional.  The supported key types are:

             <a href="mailto:sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com">sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com</a>
             ecdsa-sha2-nistp256
             ecdsa-sha2-nistp384
             ecdsa-sha2-nistp521
             <a href="mailto:sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com">sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com</a>
             ssh-ed25519
             ssh-rsa

       The comment field is not used for anything (but may be convenient for the user to identify the key).

       Note that lines in this file can be several hundred bytes long (because of the size  of  the  public  key
       encoding) up to a limit of 8 kilobytes, which permits RSA keys up to 16 kilobits.  You don't want to type
       them  in;  instead,  copy  the  <u>id_ecdsa.pub</u>,  <u>id_ecdsa_sk.pub</u>, <u>id_ed25519.pub</u>, <u>id_ed25519_sk.pub</u>, or the
       <u>id_rsa.pub</u> file and edit it.

       <b>sshd</b> enforces a minimum RSA key modulus size of 1024 bits.

       The options (if present) consist of comma-separated option  specifications.   No  spaces  are  permitted,
       except  within  double  quotes.   The  following  option  specifications  are supported (note that option
       keywords are case-insensitive):

       <b>agent-forwarding</b>
               Enable authentication agent forwarding previously disabled by the <b>restrict</b> option.

       <b>cert-authority</b>
               Specifies that the listed key is a certification authority  (CA)  that  is  trusted  to  validate
               signed certificates for user authentication.

               Certificates  may  encode  access restrictions similar to these key options.  If both certificate
               restrictions and key options are present, the most restrictive union of the two is applied.

       <b>command="command"</b>
               Specifies that the command is executed whenever this key is used for authentication.  The command
               supplied by the user (if any) is ignored.  The command is run on a pty if the client  requests  a
               pty;  otherwise  it  is  run  without a tty.  If an 8-bit clean channel is required, one must not
               request a pty or should specify <b>no-pty</b>.  A quote may be included in the  command  by  quoting  it
               with a backslash.

               This option might be useful to restrict certain public keys to perform just a specific operation.
               An example might be a key that permits remote backups but nothing else.  Note that the client may
               specify  TCP and/or X11 forwarding unless they are explicitly prohibited, e.g. using the <b>restrict</b>
               key option.

               The  command  originally  supplied  by  the  client  is  available  in  the  SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND
               environment  variable.   Note  that this option applies to shell, command or subsystem execution.
               Also note that this command may be superseded by a <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5) <b>ForceCommand</b> directive.

               If a  command  is  specified  and  a  forced-command  is  embedded  in  a  certificate  used  for
               authentication, then the certificate will be accepted only if the two commands are identical.

       <b>environment="NAME=value"</b>
               Specifies  that  the  string  is  to  be added to the environment when logging in using this key.
               Environment variables set this way override other default environment values.   Multiple  options
               of  this type are permitted.  Environment processing is disabled by default and is controlled via
               the <b>PermitUserEnvironment</b> option.

       <b>expiry-time="timespec"</b>
               Specifies a time after which the key will not be accepted.   The  time  may  be  specified  as  a
               YYYYMMDD[Z]  date  or  a  YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS][Z]  time.   Dates and times will be interpreted in the
               system time zone unless suffixed by a Z character, in which case they will be interpreted in  the
               UTC time zone.

       <b>from="pattern-list"</b>
               Specifies  that in addition to public key authentication, either the canonical name of the remote
               host or its IP address must be present in the comma-separated list of patterns.  See PATTERNS  in
               <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5) for more information on patterns.

               In addition to the wildcard matching that may be applied to hostnames or addresses, a <b>from</b> stanza
               may match IP addresses using CIDR address/masklen notation.

               The  purpose  of  this  option  is  to optionally increase security: public key authentication by
               itself does not trust the network or name servers or anything (but the key); however, if somebody
               somehow steals the key, the key permits an intruder to log in from anywhere in the  world.   This
               additional option makes using a stolen key more difficult (name servers and/or routers would have
               to be compromised in addition to just the key).

       <b>no-agent-forwarding</b>
               Forbids authentication agent forwarding when this key is used for authentication.

       <b>no-port-forwarding</b>
               Forbids  TCP  forwarding  when this key is used for authentication.  Any port forward requests by
               the client will return an error.  This might be used, e.g. in connection with the <b>command</b> option.

       <b>no-pty</b>  Prevents tty allocation (a request to allocate a pty will fail).

       <b>no-user-rc</b>
               Disables execution of <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/rc">~/.ssh/rc</a></u>.

       <b>no-X11-forwarding</b>
               Forbids X11 forwarding when this key is used for authentication.  Any X11 forward requests by the
               client will return an error.

       <b>permitlisten="[host:]port"</b>
               Limit remote port forwarding with the <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) <b>-R</b> option such  that  it  may  only  listen  on  the
               specified  host (optional) and port.  IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in
               square brackets.  Multiple <b>permitlisten</b> options may be applied separated  by  commas.   Hostnames
               may   include  wildcards  as  described  in  the  PATTERNS  section  in  <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5).   A  port
               specification of <b>*</b> matches any port.  Note that the setting of <b>GatewayPorts</b> may further  restrict
               listen  addresses.  Note that <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) will send a hostname of “localhost” if a listen host was not
               specified when the forwarding was requested, and that this name is  treated  differently  to  the
               explicit localhost addresses “127.0.0.1” and “::1”.

       <b>permitopen="host:port"</b>
               Limit  local  port  forwarding  with  the  <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)  <b>-L</b> option such that it may only connect to the
               specified host and port.  IPv6 addresses can be specified by  enclosing  the  address  in  square
               brackets.   Multiple  <b>permitopen</b> options may be applied separated by commas.  No pattern matching
               or name lookup is performed on the specified hostnames, they must be literal  host  names  and/or
               addresses.  A port specification of <b>*</b> matches any port.

       <b>port-forwarding</b>
               Enable port forwarding previously disabled by the <b>restrict</b> option.

       <b>principals="principals"</b>
               On a <b>cert-authority</b> line, specifies allowed principals for certificate authentication as a comma-
               separated  list.   At  least  one  name  from  the  list must appear in the certificate's list of
               principals for the certificate to be accepted.  This option is ignored  for  keys  that  are  not
               marked as trusted certificate signers using the <b>cert-authority</b> option.

       <b>pty</b>     Permits tty allocation previously disabled by the <b>restrict</b> option.

       <b>no-touch-required</b>
               Do  not  require  demonstration of user presence for signatures made using this key.  This option
               only makes sense for the FIDO authenticator algorithms <b>ecdsa-sk</b> and <b>ed25519-sk</b>.

       <b>verify-required</b>
               Require that signatures made using this key attest that they verified the user, e.g. via  a  PIN.
               This option only makes sense for the FIDO authenticator algorithms <b>ecdsa-sk</b> and <b>ed25519-sk</b>.

       <b>restrict</b>
               Enable  all  restrictions,  i.e. disable port, agent and X11 forwarding, as well as disabling PTY
               allocation and execution of <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/rc">~/.ssh/rc</a></u>.  If any  future  restriction  capabilities  are  added  to
               authorized_keys files, they will be included in this set.

       <b>tunnel="n"</b>
               Force a <u><a href="../man4/tun.4.html">tun</a></u>(4) device on the server.  Without this option, the next available device will be used
               if the client requests a tunnel.

       <b>user-rc</b>
               Enables execution of <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/rc">~/.ssh/rc</a></u> previously disabled by the <b>restrict</b> option.

       <b>X11-forwarding</b>
               Permits X11 forwarding previously disabled by the <b>restrict</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</u>  and <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a></u> files contain host public keys for all known hosts.
       The global file should be prepared by the administrator (optional), and the per-user file  is  maintained
       automatically: whenever the user connects to an unknown host, its key is added to the per-user file.

       Each  line  in  these  files  contains  the  following  fields:  marker  (optional),  hostnames, keytype,
       base64-encoded key, comment.  The fields are separated by spaces.

       The marker is optional, but if it is present then it must be one of “@cert-authority”, to  indicate  that
       the  line  contains a certification authority (CA) key, or “@revoked”, to indicate that the key contained
       on the line is revoked and must not ever be accepted.  Only one marker should be used on a key line.

       Hostnames is a comma-separated list of patterns (‘*’ and ‘?’ act as wildcards); each pattern in  turn  is
       matched   against   the   host  name.   When  <b>sshd</b>  is  authenticating  a  client,  such  as  when  using
       <b>HostbasedAuthentication</b>, this will be the canonical client host name.  When <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)  is  authenticating  a
       server,  this  will  be  the  host name given by the user, the value of the <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) <b>HostkeyAlias</b> if it was
       specified, or the canonical server hostname if the <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) <b>CanonicalizeHostname</b> option was used.

       A pattern may also be preceded by ‘!’ to indicate negation: if the host name matches a  negated  pattern,
       it  is not accepted (by that line) even if it matched another pattern on the line.  A hostname or address
       may optionally be enclosed within ‘[’ and ‘]’ brackets then followed  by  ‘:’  and  a  non-standard  port
       number.

       Alternately,  hostnames  may  be  stored in a hashed form which hides host names and addresses should the
       file's contents be disclosed.  Hashed hostnames start with a ‘|’ character.  Only one hashed hostname may
       appear on a single line and none of the above negation or wildcard operators may be applied.

       The keytype and base64-encoded key are taken directly from the  host  key;  they  can  be  obtained,  for
       example,  from  <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub</a></u>.   The  optional  comment field continues to the end of the
       line, and is not used.

       Lines starting with ‘#’ and empty lines are ignored as comments.

       When performing host authentication, authentication is accepted if any matching line has the proper  key;
       either one that matches exactly or, if the server has presented a certificate for authentication, the key
       of  the  certification authority that signed the certificate.  For a key to be trusted as a certification
       authority, it must use the “@cert-authority” marker described above.

       The known hosts file also provides a facility to mark keys as revoked, for example when it is known  that
       the  associated  private  key  has  been  stolen.  Revoked keys are specified by including the “@revoked”
       marker at the beginning of the key line, and are never accepted for authentication  or  as  certification
       authorities, but instead will produce a warning from <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) when they are encountered.

       It  is permissible (but not recommended) to have several lines or different host keys for the same names.
       This will inevitably happen when short forms of host names from different domains are put  in  the  file.
       It  is  possible  that  the  files  contain  conflicting information; authentication is accepted if valid
       information can be found from either file.

       Note that the lines in these files are typically hundreds of characters long, and  you  definitely  don't
       want  to  type in the host keys by hand.  Rather, generate them by a script, <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keyscan.1.html">ssh-keyscan</a></u>(1) or by taking,
       for example, <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub</a></u> and adding the host names at the  front.   <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></u>(1)  also
       offers  some basic automated editing for <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a></u> including removing hosts matching a host name
       and converting all host names to their hashed representations.

       An example ssh_known_hosts file:

          # Comments allowed at start of line
          cvs.example.net,192.0.2.10 ssh-rsa AAAA1234.....=
          # A hashed hostname
          |1|JfKTdBh7rNbXkVAQCRp4OQoPfmI=|USECr3SWf1JUPsms5AqfD5QfxkM= ssh-rsa
          AAAA1234.....=
          # A revoked key
          @revoked * ssh-rsa AAAAB5W...
          # A CA key, accepted for any host in *.mydomain.com or *.mydomain.org
          @cert-authority *.mydomain.org,*.mydomain.com ssh-rsa AAAAB5W...

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.hushlogin">~/.hushlogin</a></u>
               This file is used to suppress printing the last login time and  <u>/etc/motd</u>,  if  <b>PrintLastLog</b>  and
               <b>PrintMotd</b>,  respectively,  are enabled.  It does not suppress printing of the banner specified by
               <b>Banner</b>.

       <u><a href="file:~/.rhosts">~/.rhosts</a></u>
               This file is used for host-based authentication (see  <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)  for  more  information).   On  some
               machines  this  file  may  need  to  be  world-readable if the user's home directory is on an NFS
               partition, because <b>sshd</b> reads it as root.  Additionally, this file must be owned by the user, and
               must not have write permissions for anyone else.  The recommended permission for most machines is
               read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.

       <u><a href="file:~/.shosts">~/.shosts</a></u>
               This file is used in exactly the same  way  as  <u>.rhosts</u>,  but  allows  host-based  authentication
               without permitting login with rlogin/rsh.

       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/">~/.ssh/</a></u>
               This  directory  is  the  default location for all user-specific configuration and authentication
               information.  There is no general requirement to keep  the  entire  contents  of  this  directory
               secret,  but  the recommended permissions are read/write/execute for the user, and not accessible
               by others.

       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a></u>
               Lists the public keys (ECDSA, Ed25519, RSA) that can be used for logging in as  this  user.   The
               format of this file is described above.  The content of the file is not highly sensitive, but the
               recommended permissions are read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.

               If  this  file,  the  <u><a href="file:~/.ssh">~/.ssh</a></u> directory, or the user's home directory are writable by other users,
               then the file could be modified or replaced by unauthorized users.  In this case, <b>sshd</b>  will  not
               allow it to be used unless the <b>StrictModes</b> option has been set to “no”.

       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/environment">~/.ssh/environment</a></u>
               This file is read into the environment at login (if it exists).  It can only contain empty lines,
               comment  lines  (that  start  with  ‘#’),  and assignment lines of the form name=value.  The file
               should be writable only by the user; it  need  not  be  readable  by  anyone  else.   Environment
               processing is disabled by default and is controlled via the <b>PermitUserEnvironment</b> option.

       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a></u>
               Contains  a  list of host keys for all hosts the user has logged into that are not already in the
               systemwide list of known host keys.  The format of this  file  is  described  above.   This  file
               should be writable only by root/the owner and can, but need not be, world-readable.

       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/rc">~/.ssh/rc</a></u>
               Contains  initialization  routines to be run before the user's home directory becomes accessible.
               This file should be writable only by the user, and need not be readable by anyone else.

       <u><a href="file:/etc/hosts.allow">/etc/hosts.allow</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:/etc/hosts.deny">/etc/hosts.deny</a></u>
               Access controls that should be enforced by tcp-wrappers are defined here.   Further  details  are
               described in <u><a href="../man5/hosts_access.5.html">hosts_access</a></u>(5).

       <u>/etc/hosts.equiv</u>
               This file is for host-based authentication (see <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)).  It should only be writable by root.

       <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/moduli">/etc/ssh/moduli</a></u>
               Contains  Diffie-Hellman groups used for the "Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange" key exchange method.
               The file format is described in <u><a href="../man5/moduli.5.html">moduli</a></u>(5).  If no usable groups are found in this file then fixed
               internal groups will be used.

       <u>/etc/motd</u>
               See <u><a href="../man5/motd.5.html">motd</a></u>(5).

       <u>/etc/nologin</u>
               If this file exists, <b>sshd</b> refuses to let anyone except root log in.  The contents of the file are
               displayed to anyone trying to log in, and non-root connections are refused.  The file  should  be
               world-readable.

       <u>/etc/ssh/shosts.equiv</u>
               This  file  is  used in exactly the same way as <u>hosts.equiv</u>, but allows host-based authentication
               without permitting login with rlogin/rsh.

       <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key</a></u>
               These files contain the private parts of the host keys.  These files  should  only  be  owned  by
               root,  readable  only  by  root,  and not accessible to others.  Note that <b>sshd</b> does not start if
               these files are group/world-accessible.

       <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub</a></u>
               These files contain the public parts of the host keys.  These files should be world-readable  but
               writable  only  by  root.  Their contents should match the respective private parts.  These files
               are not really used for anything; they are provided for the convenience  of  the  user  so  their
               contents can be copied to known hosts files.  These files are created using <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></u>(1).

       <u>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</u>
               Systemwide  list of known host keys.  This file should be prepared by the system administrator to
               contain the public host keys of all machines in the organization.  The format  of  this  file  is
               described  above.   This  file  should  be  writable  only by root/the owner and should be world-
               readable.

       <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/sshd_config">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</a></u>
               Contains configuration data for <b>sshd</b>.  The file format and configuration options are described in
               <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5).

       <u>/etc/ssh/sshrc</u>
               Similar to <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/rc">~/.ssh/rc</a></u>, it can be  used  to  specify  machine-specific  login-time  initializations
               globally.  This file should be writable only by root, and should be world-readable.

       <u><a href="file:/run/sshd">/run/sshd</a></u>
               <u><a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</a></u>(2)  directory  used  by  <b>sshd</b> during privilege separation in the pre-authentication phase.
               The directory should not contain any files and must be owned by root  and  not  group  or  world-
               writable.

       <u><a href="file:/run/sshd.pid">/run/sshd.pid</a></u>
               Contains  the  process  ID  of  the  <b>sshd</b> listening for connections (if there are several daemons
               running concurrently for different ports, this contains the process ID of the one started  last).
               The content of this file is not sensitive; it can be world-readable.
