       sysprofile - modular centralized shell configuration

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sysprofile</b>  is  a  generic  approach  to configure shell settings in a modular and centralized way mostly
       aimed at avoiding work for lazy sysadmins.  It has only been tested to work with the bash shell.

       It basically consists of the small <b>/etc/sysprofile</b> shell script which invokes other small  shell  scripts
       having  a <b>.bash</b> suffix which are contained in the <b>/etc/sysprofile.d/</b> directory.  The system administrator
       can drop in any script he wants without any naming convention other than that the scripts need to have  a
       .bash suffix to enable automagic sourcing by <b>/etc/sysprofile.</b>

       This  mechanism  is  set  up  by  inserting  a small shell routine into <b><a href="file:/etc/profile">/etc/profile</a></b> for login shells and
       optionally  into  <b>/etc/bashrc</b>  and/or  <b><a href="file:/etc/bash.bashrc">/etc/bash.bashrc</a></b>  for  non-login  shells  from  where  the  actual
       <b>/etc/sysprofile</b> script is invoked:

           if [ -f /etc/sysprofile ]; then
                   . /etc/sysprofile
           fi

       For  using  "sysprofile"  under  X11, one can source it in a similar way from <b>/etc/X11/Xsession</b> or your X
       display manager's <b>Xsession</b> file to provide the same shell environment as under the console in  X11.   See
       the example files in <b>/usr/share/doc/sysprofile/</b> for illustration.

       For usage of terminal emulators with a non-login bash shell under X11, take care to enable sysprofile via
       <b>/etc/bash.bashrc.</b>   If  not  set  this  way,  your  terminal emulators won't come up with the environment
       defined by the scripts in <b>/etc/sysprofile.d/.</b>

       Users not wanting <b>/etc/sysprofile</b> to be sourced for their environment can easily disable  it's  automatic
       mechanism.   It can be disabled by simply creating an empty file called <b>$HOME/.nosysprofile</b> in the user's
       home directory using e.g. the <b><a href="../man1/touch.1.html">touch</a>(1)</b> command.

       Any single configuration file in <b>/etc/sysprofile.d/</b> can be overridden by any user by creating  a  private
       <b>$HOME/.sysprofile.d/</b>  directory  which  may  contain a user's own version of any configuration file to be
       sourced instead of the system default.  It's names have  just  to  match  exactly  the  system's  default
       <b>/etc/sysprofile.d/</b>   configuration   files.    Empty   versions   of   these   files   contained  in  the
       <b>$HOME/.sysprofile.d/</b> directory automatically disable sourcing of the system wide version.

       Naturally, users can add and include their own private script inventions to be automagically executed  by
       <b>/etc/sysprofile</b> at login time.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  no  options  other  than those dictated by shell conventions.  Anything is defined within the
       configuration scripts themselves.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The README files and configuration examples contained in <b>/etc/sysprofile.d/</b> and the manual pages <b><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1),</b>
       <b><a href="../man1x/xdm.1x.html">xdm</a>(1x),</b> <b><a href="../man5/xdm.options.5.html">xdm.options</a>(5),</b> and <b><a href="../man1x/wdm.1x.html">wdm</a>(1x).</b>  Recommended further  reading  is  everything  related  with  shell
       programming.

       If  you  need  a  similar  mechanism  for  executing  code  at  logout time check out the related package
       <b><a href="../man8/syslogout.8.html">syslogout</a>(8)</b> which is a very close companion to <b>sysprofile.</b>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sysprofile</b> in its current form is mainly restricted to <b><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</b> syntax.  In fact it is actually  a  rather
       embarrassing  quick  and  dirty hack than anything else - but it works.  It  serves the practical need to
       enable a centralized bash configuration  until something better  becomes  available.   Your  constructive
       criticism  in  making   this   into something better" is very welcome.  Before i forget to mention it: we
       take patches... ;-)

       <b>sysprofile</b> was developed by Paul  Seelig  &lt;<a href="mailto:pseelig@debian.org">pseelig@debian.org</a>&gt;  specifically  for  the  Debian  GNU/Linux
       system.   Feel  free to port it to and use it anywhere else under the conditions of either the GNU public

       than it currently is.
