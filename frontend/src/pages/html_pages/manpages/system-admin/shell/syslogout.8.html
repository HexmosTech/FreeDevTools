</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       syslogout - modular centralized shell logout mechanism

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>syslogout</b>  is  a  generic  approach  to  enable centralized shell logout actions for all users of a given
       system in a modular and centralized way mostly aimed at avoiding work for lazy sysadmins.   It  has  only
       been tested to work with the bash shell.

       It  basically  consists  of the small <b>/etc/syslogout</b> shell script which invokes other small shell scripts
       having a <b>.bash</b> suffix which are contained in the <b>/etc/syslogout.d/</b> directory.  The  system  administrator
       can  drop in any script he wants without any naming convention other than that the scripts need to have a
       .bash suffix to enable automagic sourcing by the <b>/etc/syslogout</b> script.

       For shell sessions, the contents of <b>/etc/syslogout.d/"</b> will be sourced by every user  at  logout  if  the
       following lines are present in his <b>$HOME/.bash_logout:</b>

           if [ -f /etc/syslogout ]; then
               . /etc/syslogout
           fi

       If  used  for  X sessions it is advisable to include the former statement into the <b>Xreset</b> script of the X
       display manager instead to prevent that closing of an terminal emulator window yields unexpected  results
       in  your  running X session if your X11 terminal emulator is using a login shell.  Be sure then to run it
       under the user-id of the X session's user.   See  the  example  files  in  <b>/usr/share/doc/syslogout/</b>  for
       illustration.

       Users  not  wanting  <b>/etc/syslogout</b> to be sourced for their environment can easily disable it's automatic
       mechanism.  It can be disabled by simply creating an empty file called <b>$HOME/.nosyslogout</b> in  the  user's
       home directory using e.g. the <b><a href="../man1/touch.1.html">touch</a>(1)</b> command.

       Any  single  configuration  file  in <b>/etc/syslogout.d/</b> can simply be overridden by any user by creating a
       private <b>$HOME/.syslogout.d/</b> directory which may contain a user's own version of any configuration file to
       be sourced instead of the system default.  It's names have just to match  exactly  the  system's  default
       <b>/etc/syslogout.d/</b>   configuration   files.    Empty   versions   of   these   files   contained   in  the
       <b>$HOME/.syslogout.d/</b> directory automatically disable sourcing of the system wide version.

       Naturally, users can add  and  include  their  own  private  scripts  to  be  automagically  executed  by
       <b>/etc/syslogout</b> at logout time.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  no  options  other  than those dictated by shell conventions.  Anything is defined within the
       configuration scripts themselves.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The README files and configuration examples contained in <b>/usr/share/doc/syslogout/</b> and  the  manual  page
       for  <b><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1),</b>  <b><a href="../man1x/xdm.1x.html">xdm</a>(1x),</b>  <b><a href="../man5/xdm.options.5.html">xdm.options</a>(5),</b>  and <b><a href="../man1x/wdm.1x.html">wdm</a>(1x).</b>  Recommended further reading is everything related
       with shell programming.

       If you need a similar mechanism  for  executing  code  at  login  time  check  out  the  related  package
       <b><a href="../man8/sysprofile.8.html">sysprofile</a>(8)</b> which is a very close companion to <b>syslogout.</b>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>syslogout</b>  in  its current form is mainly restricted to <b><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</b> syntax.  In fact it is actually  a rather
       embarrassing quick and dirty hack than anything else - but it works.  It  serves the  practical  need  to
       enable  a  centralized  bash  configuration  until something better becomes available.  Your constructive
       criticism in making  this  into something better" is very welcome.  Before i forget  to  mention  it:  we
       take patches... ;-)
