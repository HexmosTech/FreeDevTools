</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Aprx-2</b> - An APRS iGate application with integrated Digipeater.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>aprx</b> [<b>-d</b>[<b>d</b>[<b>d</b>]]] [<b>-e</b>] [<b>-i</b>] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-V</b>] [<b>-l</b> <u>syslogfacilityname</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>/etc/aprx.conf</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>aprx</b>  program  is a special purpose Ham-radio application supplying infrastructure services for APRS
       protocol use.

       A more detailed manual is available at:
       <a href="http://thelifeofkenneth.com/aprx/aprx-manual.pdf">http://thelifeofkenneth.com/aprx/aprx-manual.pdf</a>

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       The Aprx begun  as  a  receive-only  APRS  iGate  application  with  minimum  system  support  technology
       requirements.   This  version has also multi-port digipeater support, transmit iGate, and experimental D-
       PRS-to-APRS RF/Rx-iGate.

       •  The Aprx does not require machine to have any other software in it, than things in UNIX standard libc.
          In particular no special AX.25 libraries at all, nor widgets or even C++ runtime.

       •  Important goal has been to keep R/W memory footprint as small as possible, and on general purpose i386
          Linux a single radio port iGate+digipeater is now around 250 kB of R/W memory allocations.

       •  Any UNIX (and UNIX like) platform should work for the Aprx, or be trivially ported.

       •  The Aprx can listen "TNC2 monitor" and "KISS" speaking TNCs on any serial ports.

       •  For Aprx the serial port can be ordinary host computer port, a USB serial port, or remote  port  on  a
          remote  server  behind the internet, like cisco router AUX ports (port 4001, TCP STREAM without TELNET
          escapes.)

       •  The Aprx does not require machine to have AX.25 protocol support internally!  (Thus this works also on
          e.g. Solaris and BSD machines without PF_AX25 sockets.)

       •  On Linux machine with kernel internal  AX.25  protocol  support,  the  Aprx  can  listen  on  it  with
          promiscuous mode and in order to use that, the Aprx must be started as <u>root</u> user, and be configured to
          list interface callsigns that APRS packets are coming in.  The AX.25 socket listening is not in itself
          configurable,  it  is always exists in Linux systems, and related configuration parameters are ignored
          in other platforms.  This socket listening does not need auxiliary "libax25" to function.

       •  The Aprx program can be run without root privileges at least against remote serial port servers.   One
          must  change  local  serial  port ownership or access-groups (if any are used) to userid that runs the
          program and possibly do several changes of  file  paths  in  configuration  file  beginning  with  its
          location  (startup  parameter).   How  that  is  done  is  up to the user or system integrator of this
          program.

       •  The Aprx connects with one callsign-ssid pair to APRS-IS core for all received radio ports.

       •  The Aprx Rx-iGate knows that messages with following tokens in AX.25 VIA fields are not to be  relayed
          into APRS-IS network:
                <b>RFONLY,</b> <b>NOGATE,</b> <b>TCPIP,</b> <b>TCPXX</b>

       •  The  Aprx  Rx-iGate knows that following source address prefixes are bogus and thus messages with them
          are to be junked:
                <b>WIDE,</b> <b>RELAY,</b> <b>TRACE,</b> <b>TCPIP,</b> <b>TCPXX,</b> <b>NOCALL,</b> <b>N0CALL</b>

       •  The Aprx Rx-iGate Drops all <u>query</u> messages ("?").

       •  The Aprx Rx-iGate opens up all 3rd party messages ("}"), and checks the internal data if it is  OK  to
          be gated out to APRS-IS.

       •  The  Aprx has built-in "Erlang monitor" mechanism that telemeters each receiving interface to APRS-IS.
          It can also syslog the interface specific channel occupancy, and optionally can output to STDOUT.

       •  The Aprx (since version 1.91) can do digipeater functions.

       •  The Aprx (since version 1.99) does have experimental D-STAR D-PRS to APRS gateway functionality.   See
          the <u>aprx-manual.pdf</u> for details.

       •  The  Aprx can be run on systems without writable storage, even with very little memory, like on NSLU2,
          and OpenWrt platforms.  The experiments have shown that a single radio Tx-iGate+digipeater works  with
          less  than  300  kB of writable RAM for the Aprx itself.  Additional memory is necessary for operating
          system services of TCP/IP networking, and serial port drivers.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>aprx</b> has following runtime options:

       <b>-i</b>     Keep the program foreground without debugging outputs.

       <b>-d</b>     Turn on verbose debugging, outputs data to STDOUT.

       <b>-dd</b>    the "more debug" mode shows also details of network interaction with the APRS-IS network service.

       <b>-ddd</b>   the "even more debug" mode shows also detail classification of every kind  of  frame  received  in
              KISS variants.

       <b>-e</b>     <u>Erlang</u>  <u>output</u> prints 10 minute and 60 minute traffic accumulation byte counts, and guestimates on
              channel occupancy, alias "Erlang".  These outputs are sent to STDOUT, which  system  operator  may
              choose to log elsewere.  This is independent if the "-l" option below.

       <b>-f</b> <u>/etc/aprx.conf</u>
              Configuration file, given path is built-in default, and can be overridden by the program runner.

       <b>-l</b> <u>syslogfacilityname</u>
              Defines  syslog<b>(3)</b>  facility code used by the erlang reporter by defining its name.  Default value
              is: <b>NONE</b>, and accepted values are: <b>LOG_DAEMON</b>, <b>LOG_FTP</b>,  <b>LOG_LPR</b>,  <b>LOG_MAIL</b>,  <b>LOG_NEWS</b>,  <b>LOG_USER</b>,
              <b>LOG_UUCP</b>,  <b>LOG_LOCAL0</b>,  <b>LOG_LOCAL1</b>,  <b>LOG_LOCAL2</b>,  <b>LOG_LOCAL3</b>,  <b>LOG_LOCAL4</b>, <b>LOG_LOCAL5</b>, <b>LOG_LOCAL6</b>,
              <b>LOG_LOCAL7</b>.  That list is subject to actual facility code set in the system, and in  any  case  if
              you  specify  a  code  that  is  not known, then the program will complain during the startup, and
              report it.  This is independent of the "-e" option above.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose logging of received traffic to STDOUT.  Lines begin with reception timestamp (UNIX  time_t
              seconds),  then  TAB,  and  either data as is, or with prefix byte: "*" for "discarded due to data
              content", or possibly "#" for "discarded due to APRS-IS being unreachable".

       <b>-V</b>     Print source version compiled to this binary, and exit.

   <b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>SYSTEM</b>
       Use parameter set <b>-ddv</b> (or <b>-dddv</b>) to test new configuration by running it synchronously to console.

   <b>NORMAL</b> <b>OPERATION</b>
       Running the <b>aprx</b> program without any of option flags: <b>-d</b>, <b>-v</b>, or <b>-e</b> reads possibly  given  configuration,
       then automatically backgrounds the process, and writes <u>pidfile</u>.  When the process whose number written in
       <u>pidfile</u>  is then sent a SIGTERM signal, it automatically shuts down itself, and removes the <u>pidfile</u>.  The
       <u>pidfile</u> can be runtime configured  with  the  <b>-f</b>  <u>/etc/aprx.conf</u>  file,  and  it  has  default  name  of:
       <u>/var/run/aprx.pid</u>.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file is used to setup the program to do its job.

       You can construct following configurations:

       •  A <u>receive-only</u> iGate server.

       •  A digipeater with bi-directional iGate server.

       •  A <u>single</u> <u>radio</u> digipeater.  (The most common type of digipeater.)

       •  A  <u>multi-interfaced</u>  digipeater  relaying traffic in between multiple radios.  (On same or on separate
          frequencies.)

       •  A <u>viscuous</u> <u>digipeater,</u> which relays a packet it heard from viscuous source after the  viscuous  delay,
          <u>unless</u>  <u>it</u>  <u>was</u>  <u>heard</u>  <u>more</u> <u>times</u> <u>than</u> <u>only</u> <u>once,</u> or it was heard from non-viscuous source before the
          viscuous one was digipeated.  This allows of making fill-in digipeaters that  will  not  digipeat  the
          packet, if that same packet was heard twice or more before the viscuos delay expired.

       In the configuration file a line ending backslash (\) character concatenates next input line into itself.
       Combined result can be up to 8000 bytes long.  This combination can be a bit surprising:
          #beacon .... long text  \
                 continuation
       results in single long input line that begins with '#' (it is comment) and all continuations following it
       have  been folded in.  Presented line number of combined continuation is the line number of the <u>last</u> line
       segment in this type of multi-line input.

       In the configuration file there is special treatment for quoted strings.  They are stripped of the  outer
       quotes, and "\" character is processed within the source string to produce an output string.  The escapes
       are:

       <b>\n</b>     Produces newline character (Control-J) on the output string.

       <b>\r</b>     Produces carriage return character (Control-M) on the output string.

       <b>\\</b>     Places a back-slash on the output string.

       <b>\"</b>     Places a double-quote on the output string.

       <b>\'</b>     Places a single-quote on the output string.

       <b>\xHH</b>   Lower-case  "x"  precedes  two hex digits which ensemble is then converted to a single byte in the
              output string.

       The complex encodings are for possible initstrings  of  the  external  devices,  and  in  particular  for
       initstrings even a nul byte ( \x00 ) is supported.

       A configuration token without surrounding quotes does not understand the backslash escapes.

       #beacon symbol "R&amp;" $myloc comment "Rx-only iGate"
       #
       # Following are basic options:
       #  'symbol'    no default, must be defined!
       #  'lat'       coordinate latitude:   ddmm.mmN  (no default!)
       #  'lon'       coordinate longitude: dddmm.mmE  (no default!)
       #  '$myloc'    coordinate values taken from global 'myloc' entry,
       #              and usable in place of explicit 'lat'+'lon'.
       #  'comment'   optional tail part of the item, default is nothing
       #
       # Sample symbols:
       #   R&amp;   is for "Rx-only iGate"
       #   I&amp;   is for "Tx-iGate"
       #   /#   is for "Digipeater"
       #   I#   is for "Tx-iGate + Digipeater"
       #
       # Additional options are:
       # 'srccall'   parameter sets claimed origination address.
       # 'dstcall'   sets destination address, default "APRXnn"
       # 'interface' parameter picks an interface (must be "tx-ok true" type)
       # 'via'       sets radio distribution pattern, default: none.
       # 'timefix'  On APRS messages with HMS timestamp (hour:min:sec), the
       #            system fixes appropriate field with transmit time timestamp.
       #
       # Message type is by default '!', which is positional no timestamp format.
       # Other possible formats are definable with options:
       # 'type'   Single character setting type:  ! = / @
       # 'item'   Defines a name of Item (')') type beacons.
       # 'object' Defines a name of Object (';') type beacons.
       #
       # 'file' option tells a file at which a _raw_ APRS message content is
       #        expected to be found as first line of text. Line ending newline
       #        is removed, and no escapes are supported.  The timefix is
       #        available, though probably should not be used.
       #
       # 'exec' option defines program path for a program whose stdout is
       #        read up to first newline (which must be present), and then
       #        transmit as beacon content. No format helpers are supplied,
       #        although 'timefix' can be used.
       # 'timeout' option is associated with 'exec', and defines when the
       #        exec must by latest produce the output, or the subprogram
       #        execution is killed. Default value is 10 seconds.
       #
       # The parameter sets can vary:
       #  a) 'srccall nnn-n dstcall "string" symbol "R&amp;" lat "ddmm.mmN" lon "dddmm.mmE" [comment "any text"]
       #  b) 'srccall nnn-n dstcall "string" raw "string"'
       #
       # The a) form flags on some of possible syntax errors in parameters.
       # It will also create only "!" type messages.  The dest parameter
       # defaults to "APRS", but can be used to give other destinations.
       # The via parameter can be used to add other keywords, like "NOGATE".
       #
       # Writing correct RAW format beacon message is very hard,
       # which is evidenced by the frequency of bad syntax texts
       # people so often put there...   If you can not be persuaded
       # not to do it, then at least VERIFY the beacon result on
       # web service like  findu.com,  or  aprs.fi

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>MYCALL</b> <b>PARAMETER</b></h4><pre>
       In  majority  of  usage models, system needs single configured callsign.  This is set by using the <b>mycall</b>
       configuration option, and latter  referred  to  in  configurations  as  <b>$mycall</b>  parameter  in  place  of
       callsigns.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>MYLOC</b> <b>PARAMETER</b></h4><pre>
       Usually  multiple  beacons,  and simple filter rules are wanted to be using same reference coordinate for
       this system.  This  is  set  by  using  the  <b>myloc</b>  configuration  option,  and  latter  referred  to  in
       configurations as <b>$myloc</b> parameter in place of "lat nn lon mm" coordinate pair of beacons.

</pre><h4><b>APRSIS</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>APRSIS</b> <b>CONNECTIVITY</b></h4><pre>
       Settings in the <b>&lt;aprsis&gt;</b> section define connectivity with the APRS-IS network service.

       Necessary option is <u>server</u>, and others are optional.

       Available options are:

       login $mycall
               The APRSIS network login.  Defaults to the <b>mycall</b> configuration entry.

       passcode -1
               Defining  a small integer in range of 0 to 32767 authenticating your login to APRS-IS server. Ask
               for assistance from your APRS-IS managers, or calculate it yourself with <u>aprspass</u>  program.  (Web
               search engines do find several of them.)

       server <u>server-name</u> <u>14850</u>
               Define  which APRS-IS is being connected to.  Multiple definitions are used in round-robin style,
               if the connection with the previous one fails for some reason.

       filter <u>'filter</u> <u>specs</u> <u>in</u> <u>quotes'</u> <u>#</u> <u>comments</u>
               Set filter adjunct definitions on APRS-IS server.  Multiple entries  are  catenated  together  in
               entry order, when connecting to the server.

</pre><h4><b>LOGGING</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>&lt;logging&gt;</b> section defines miscellaneous file names and options for state tracking and logging use.

       pidfile <u>/var/run/aprx.pid</u>
               The  pidfile  is  UNIX way to tell that others that this program is running with given process-id
               number.  This has compiled-in default value of: pidfile /var/run/aprx.pid

       rflog <u>/var/log/aprx/aprx-rf.log</u>
               The <u>rflog</u> defines a rotatable file into which all RF-received packets are logged.   There  is  no
               default.

       aprxlog <u>/var/log/aprx/aprx.log</u>
               The  <u>aprxlog</u>  defines a rotatable file into which most important events on APRS-IS connection are
               logged, namely connects and disconnects.  There is no default.

       erlangfile <u>/var/run/aprx.state</u>
               The <u>erlangfile</u> defines a mmap():able binary file, which stores running sums  of  interfaces  upon
               which  the  channel erlang estimator runs, and collects data.  Depending on the system, it may be
               running on a filesystem that actually retains data over  reboots,  or  it  may  not.   With  this
               backing  store,  the system does not loose cumulating erlang data over the current period, if the
               restart is quick, and does not stradle any exact minute.  This file is around  0.7  MB  per  each
               interface  talking  APRS.   If  this  file  is  not defined and can not be created, internal non-
               persistent in-memory storage will be used.  Built-in default value is: /var/run/aprx.state

       erlang-loglevel <u>NONE</u>
               The <u>erlang-loglevel</u> is config file edition of the "-l" option pushing erlang data  to  <u><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></u>(3).
               Valid  values  are  (possibly) following: NONE, LOG_DAEMON, LOG_FTP, LOG_LPR, LOG_MAIL, LOG_NEWS,
               LOG_USER, LOG_UUCP,  LOG_LOCAL0,  LOG_LOCAL1,  LOG_LOCAL2,  LOG_LOCAL3,  LOG_LOCAL4,  LOG_LOCAL5,
               LOG_LOCAL6,  LOG_LOCAL7.   If  the parameter value is not acceptable, list of accepted values are
               printed at startup.

       erlanglog <u>/var/log/aprx/erlang.log</u>
               The erlanglog defines a rotatable file into which erlang data is written in text form.  There  is
               no default.

       erlang-log1min
               The  <u>erlang-log1min</u> option logs to syslog/file also 1 minute interval data from the program.  (In
               addition to 10m and 60m.)  Default is off.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b> <b>SECTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>RADIO</b> <b>PORTS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>&lt;interface&gt;</b> sections define connections to radio modems.  Several different styles are available:

       • Local serial ports in the machine (<b>device-serial</b> <b>/dev/ttyS0</b> <u>speed</u> <u>encapsulation</u>)

       • Local USB serial ports in the machine (<b>device-serial</b> <b>/dev/ttyUSB0</b> <u>speed</u> <u>encapsulation</u>)

       • Remote served serial ports over a TCP stream.  Implemented to talk with Cisco AUX ports on "range 4000"
         (TCP STREAM, no TELNET escapes) (<b>tcp-device</b> <b>12.34.56.78</b> <b>4001</b> <u>encapsulation</u>)

       • Linux internal AX.25 network attached devices (<b>ax25-device</b> <b>CALLSIGN-1</b>) are only available when  running
         on  a  Linux system.  On a non-Linux system it connects to a null interface, never getting anything and
         can always sink everything.

       The serial port name tells what kind of port  is  in  question,  and  while  port  baud-rate  (9600)  and
       character settings (8n1) must always be set, they are ignored for the remote connection.

       Following <u>speed</u> modes are available:
            <b>1200,</b> <u>1800,</u> <b>2400,</b> <b>4800,</b> <b>9600,</b> <b>19200,</b> <u>38400,</u> <u>57600,</u>
            <u>115200,</u> <u>230400,</u> <u>460800,</u> <u>500000,</u> <u>576000</u>
       Likely available speeds are in bold, other supported values are listed in italics.

       Following <u>encapsulation</u> modes are available:

       <b>TNC2</b>      is  capable  only  to monitor the packets reported by TNC2 type debug output, and Rx-iGate, but
                 they are not acceptable as source for a &lt;digipeater&gt;.

       <b>DPRS</b>      is special mode for gateway from D-STAR D-PRS to  APRS.   This  must  always  have  a  callsign
                 definition for the gateway.

       <b>KISS</b>      Basic  KISS  encapsulation.   No  checksums.  Will autodetect (sometimes) packets with SMACK or
                 FLEXNET characteristics.

       <b>SMACK</b>     <u>Stuttgart</u> <u>Modified</u> <u>Amateurradio-CRC-KISS</u>, which runs CRC-16 checksum on KISS datastream much in
                 the same way as HDLC has CCITT-CRC checksum on it.

       <b>FLEXNET</b>   <u>FLEXNET</u> which runs a CRC checksum of its own polynomial on KISS datastream much in the same way
                 as HDLC has CCITT-CRC checksum on it.

       <b>BPQCRC</b>    XOR "checksum" on dataframes.  Also known as "XKISS", and "XORSUM".  This  detects  single  bit
                 failure, but weakly any multibit failures.  Extra 0x00 bytes have no effect on checksum, etc.

       On  <b>&lt;kiss-subif</b>  <u>tncid</u><b>&gt;</b>  sub-options  the parameter is <u>tncid</u>, which sets up KISS multiplexer parameter so
       that subsequent options applies only on designated KISS sub-port.

       The <u>callsign</u> option sets port specific callsign when relaying to APRS-IS.

       The <u>telem-to-is</u> <u>true</u> option can be used to disable (by explicitly setting it to 'false') radio  interface
       telemetry  transmission  to  APRS-IS.   By default it is on.  This is separate from &lt;telemetry&gt; sections,
       which send telemetry to RF interfaces.

</pre><h4><b>BEACON</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The beacons are defined using <b>&lt;beacon&gt;</b> configuration sections.

       Because classical beacon definitions are highly error-prone, this program has a new way to define them:

       • The new way to define beacons:
         beacon symbol "R&amp;" lat "0000.00N" lon "00000.00E"  \
                comment "aprx - iGate"

       • Semi-clasical definition of raw APRS packet:
         beacon raw "!0000.00NR00000.00E&amp;aprx - iGate"

       • Load beacon text from a file, path data is configurable:
         beacon file <u>/path/to/file</u>

       • Run a program to produce beacon data in raw format:
         beacon exec <u>/path/to/file</u> timeout <u>10</u>

       The fields and parameters:

       <b>interface</b>   An <u>optional</u> "interface" parameter tells that this beacon shall  be  sent  only  to  interface
                   whose  callsign  is  named.   Default  is  to  send  to all interfaces that have "tx-ok true"
                   setting.

       <b>type</b>        An <u>optional</u> one character string parameter, with one of following contents:  "!",  "=",  "/",
                   "@", ";" and ")".

       <b>srccall</b>     An  <u>optional</u>  "srccall"  parameter  tells callsign which is claimed as this particular beacon
                   source.  It must be valid AX.25 callsign in text format.  When this  "srccall"  parameter  is
                   not given, value of "mycall" configuration entry is used.

       <b>dstcall</b>     An  <u>optional</u> "dstcall" parameter has built-in software version dependent value, but it can be
                   used to define another value.

       <b>via</b>         An <u>optional</u> "via" parameter defaults to nothing, but can be used to define  additional  "VIA"
                   path tokens, for example: "WIDE1-1".

       <b>item</b>        An <u>optional</u> "item" parameter is for defining a name for an item type APRS packet.

       <b>object</b>      An <u>optional</u> "object" parameter is for defining a name for an object type APRS packet.

       <b>symbol</b>      A <u>mandatory</u> "symbol" parameter is two character code, which for Rx-only iGate is pair: "R&amp;"

       <b>lat</b>         This  <u>mandatory</u> parameter defines <u>latitude</u> coordinate (that is: north/south.)  It is expected
                   to be of format: "ddmm.mmN" where "dd" defines <u>two</u> <u>digits</u> of <u>degrees</u> of latitude, and "mm.mm"
                   defines two digits + decimal dot + two digits of <u>minutes</u> of latitude.  Then comes literal "N"
                   or "S" indicating hemisphere.

       <b>lon</b>         This <u>mandatory</u> parameter defines <u>longitude</u> coordinate (that is: east/west.)  It  is  expected
                   to  be  of  format: "dddmm.mmE" where "ddd" defines <u>three</u> <u>digits</u> of <u>degrees</u> of longitude, and
                   "mm.mm" defines two digits + decimal dot + two digits of <u>minutes</u> of  longitude.   Then  comes
                   literal "E" or "W" indicating hemisphere.

       <b>comment</b>     This  <u>optional</u>  parameter  defines  commentary  text  tail on the beacon packet.  If you need
                   characters outside US-ASCII character set, use of UTF-8  encoded  UNICODE  character  set  is
                   recommended.

       <b>raw</b>         This  <u>alternate</u>  format defines whole APRS packet content in raw text format.  <u>Currently</u> <u>this</u>
                   <u>type</u> <u>of</u> <u>packets</u> <u>are</u> <u>not</u> <u>validated</u> <u>for</u> <u>syntax</u> <u>at</u> <u>all!</u>

       <b>file</b>        This <u>alternative</u> way defines path to a file with single text line  defining  content  of  <u>raw</u>
                   message data.

       <b>exec</b>        This  <u>alternative</u>  mode  runs  designated  program, and waits for at most a <u>timeout</u> number of
                   seconds (default 10) for the program to produce the result.

       <b>timeout</b>     This is optional parameter for <u>exec</u> allowing altered timeout (number of seconds) for  waiting
                   the program to respond.  Default is 10 seconds.

       The  type/symbol/lat/lon/comment-format  supports only a few types of APRS packets.  It splits input into
       small slices that are possible to validate in detail.  (See "DEBUGGING SYSTEM" above.)

</pre><h4><b>RF-TELEMETRY</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>aprx</u> system will always send telemetry for all of its interfaces to APRSIS, but there is an option to
       define telemetry to be sent to radio channel by using following sections for  each  transmitter  that  is
       wanted to send out the telemetry.

       The parameters of <b>&lt;telemetry&gt;</b> configuration section are:

       <b>transmitter</b> A mandatory callsign referring to an <u>interface.</u>

       <b>via</b>         An optional <u>via-path</u> parameter.  Only 1 callsign!

       <b>source</b>      One or more of <u>interface</u> callsigns for which the telemetry transmission is made.

</pre><h4><b>DIGIPEATER</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>aprx</u> is possible to configure as a AX.25 digipeater with APRS twists.  This is done with <b>&lt;digipeater&gt;</b>
       configuration section and its subsections.

       <u>There</u> <u>can</u> <u>be</u> <u>at</u> <u>most</u> <u>one</u> <u>&lt;digipeater&gt;</u> <u>definition</u> <u>per</u> <u>each</u> <u>transmit</u> <u>capable</u> <u>interface</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>system.</u>  <u>On</u> <u>a</u>
       <u>system</u>  <u>with</u>  <u>multiple</u>  <u>transmitters,</u>  <u>this</u>  <u>means</u> <u>there</u> <u>can</u> <u>be</u> <u>multiple</u> <u>digipeaters,</u> <u>each</u> <u>with</u> <u>different</u>
       <u>behaviour</u> <u>rules.</u>

       Minimalistic setup for a digipeater will be as follows:

       &lt;digipeater&gt;
           transmitter     $mycall
           &lt;source&gt;
               source      $mycall
           &lt;/source&gt;
       &lt;/digipeater&gt;

       In minimalistic approach the system does digipeating of packets heard on the <u>$mycall</u>  interface  back  to
       same interface.  Single requirement is that the <u>&lt;interface&gt;</u> block has <u>tx-ok</u> <u>true</u> setting on it.

       In more complicated approaches it is possible to define multiple sources for packets:

       •  Multiple device ports.

       •  APRSIS pseudoport, which creates the Tx-iGate functionality.

   <b>&lt;digipeater&gt;</b> <b>options</b>
       Main-level &lt;digipeater&gt; options are:

       •  <u>transmitter</u> defines which interface the digipeater will output to.

       •  <u>&lt;trace&gt;</u> and <u>&lt;wide&gt;</u> sub-options are explained below.

       •  <u>&lt;source&gt;</u> sub-option is explained below.

   <b>&lt;trace&gt;</b> <b>and</b> <b>&lt;wide&gt;</b> <b>sub-options</b>
       The  <u>&lt;trace&gt;</u>  sub-option  has priority over the <u>&lt;wide&gt;</u> sub-option, otherwise they are configured the same
       way.

       The <u>&lt;trace&gt;</u> sub-option defines which AX.25 address  contained  keywords  are  treated  with  APRS  "New-N
       paradigm"  rules  in  a  way  where  each  processing  node  always marks its transmitter callsign on the
       transmitted AX.25 packet address header.

       The <u>&lt;wide&gt;</u> sub-option defines which AX.25  address  contained  keywords  are  treated  with  APRS  "New-N
       paradigm"  rules in a way where processing node does not mark its transmitter callsign on the transmitted
       AX.25 packet address header.

       Available parameters are:

       <b>keys</b>     A string of comma-separated set of string tokens:
                   keys "TRACE,WIDE"
                Alternative form for this entry is:
                   keys "TRACE"
                   keys "WIDE"

       <b>maxdone</b>  Defines maximum number of redistribution hops  that  these  keywords  can  have  completed  when
                reaching  here.   If accounting finds more done, the system will just drop the packet instead of
                digipeating it onwards.

       <b>maxreq</b>   Defines maximum number of redistribution hops that these keywords  can  define.   If  accounting
                finds more requested, the system will just drop the packet instead of digipeating it onwards.

   <b>&lt;source&gt;</b> <b>sub-options</b>
       Primary  definer option is <b>source</b> which gives callsign of an <u>&lt;interface&gt;</u> from which the AX.25 packets are
       received for this <u>&lt;source&gt;</u> block.

       Available <b>relay-type</b> modes on &lt;source&gt; definitions are:

       <b>digipeater</b>    Normal AX.25 digipeater behaviour with APRS New-N paradigm support.  This is default mode.

       <b>directonly</b>    Digipeat only directly heard packets.  Useful for systems that are designated as "fill-in".
                     See also "viscous-delay".

       <b>third-party</b>   Special mode for Tx-iGate.

       The <b>ratelimit</b> defines two parameters: <u>average</u> and <u>limit</u> number  of  packets  sent  in  60  seconds.   Its
       definitions  can  be  both  in  <u>&lt;digipeater&gt;</u> and in digipeater's <u>&lt;source&gt;</u> sections, and therefore you can
       limit each individual source to a max accepted rate as well  as  define  separate  rate  limits  for  the
       transmitter.

       The  <b>viscous-delay</b> defines a number of seconds from 0 (default) maximum of 9 that the source will put the
       message on duplicate detector delay processing.  All occurrences of same packet  per  duplicate  detector
       during  that  time  will be accounted on duplicate detection, and if at the end of the delay period there
       are more than one hit, the packet is discarded.  Use delay of 0 seconds for normal digipeater, 5  seconds
       for a fill-in, or a Tx-iGate.

       A  javAPRSSrvr  filter-adjunct  style rules are possible with the <b>filter</b> options.  When you want multiple
       filters, use multiple options with associated parameters:
           filter t/m            # APRS messaging type packets
           filter a/la/lo/la/lo  # APRS positional packets within this area

       Also negative filters are possible (prefixed with minus character), which upon match cause  rejection  of
       the  packet.   Filters  are  evaluated  in  definition  order,  and first matching one will terminate the
       evaluation.  When no filters are defined, everything is passed thru.  When any filter  is  defined,  only
       those  matching  non-negative  filters  are  passed thru, and no default "pass everything else" behaviour
       exists.

       Supported "adjunct filters" are following:

       <b>A/latN/lonW/latS/lonE</b>
               Area filter, defined as area enclosing within latS/latN and lonW/lonE.   Latitude  and  longitude
               are entered as degrees and decimals.

       <b>B/call1/call2...</b>
               Budlist filter.  Supports *-wildcards.

       <b>D/digi1/digi2...</b>
               <u>Not</u> <u>supported</u> <u>at</u> <u>APRX</u> <u>internal</u> <u>filters</u>

       <b>E/call1/call2/...</b>
               <u>Not</u> <u>supported</u> <u>at</u> <u>APRX</u> <u>internal</u> <u>filters</u>

       <b>F/call/dist_km</b>
               Great-circle distance in kilometers from friend's coordinates.  No wildcarding.
               <u>(TODO:</u> <u>check</u> <u>that</u> <u>it</u> <u>really</u> <u>works!)</u>

       <b>M/dist</b>  The <u>range</u> <u>around</u> <u>my</u> <u>location</u> filter requires that you have defined also the "myloc" configuration
               entry.   It  defines  acceptance of positions and messages with senders within <u>dist</u> kilometers of
               the "myloc" position.

       <b>O/object1/obj2...</b>
               Object name filter.  Supports *-wildcards.

       <b>P/aa/bb/cc...</b>
               Prefix filter.

       <b>Q/con/ana</b>
               <u>The</u> <u>Q-construct</u> <u>filter</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>supported.</u>

       <b>R/lat/lon/dist</b>
               Range filter.  Latitude and longitude are in degrees and decimals.  Distance  is  in  kilometers.
               No wildcards.

       <b>S/pri/alt/over</b>
               Symbol filter

       <b>T/..../call/km</b>
               Type filter.  Couple possible usages:

                 -t/c                Everything except CWOP

                  t/*/OH2RDY/50      Everything within 50 km of OH2RDY's last known position

               Type code characters are:

               <b>*</b>  An "all" wild-card.

               <b>C</b>  A CWOP.

               <b>I</b>  An ITEM.

               <b>M</b>  A MESSAGE.

               <b>N</b>  A NWS message.

               <b>O</b>  An OBJECT.

               <b>Q</b>  A QUERY.

               <b>S</b>  A STATUS response.

               <b>T</b>  A TELEMETRY packet or parameter message.

               <b>U</b>  A USERDEF message.

               <b>W</b>  A WX data packet

       <b>U/unproto1/unproto2...</b>
               Filters by value in destination address field, supports wildcard.

       The  <b>&lt;trace&gt;</b>  and  <b>&lt;wide&gt;</b>  sub-options  exist  also within each &lt;source&gt;.  Where such occur, the &lt;source&gt;
       specific &lt;trace&gt; sub-option trumps the definition on  &lt;digipeater&gt;  level,  and  same  with  &lt;wide&gt;  sub-
       options.   This  allows  things like overriding flooding control keywords on source basis, should such be
       necessary.

       A set of <b>regex-filter</b> rules can be used to reject packets that  are  not  of  approved  kind.   Available
       syntax is:

       regex-filter source RE
              source address field

       regex-filter destination RE
              destination address field

       regex-filter via RE
              any via path field

       regex-filter data RE
              payload content

       The regex-filter exists as ad-hoc method when all else fails.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES:</b> <b>ERLANG</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>Erlang</u>  is  telecom measurement of channel occupancy, and in this application sense it does tell how
       much traffic there is on the radio channel.

       Most radio transmitters are not aware of all transmitters  on  channel,  and  thus  there  can  happen  a
       collision causing loss of both messages.  The higher the channel activity, the more likely that collision
       is.  For further details, refer to statistical mathematics books, or perhaps on Wikipedia.

       In  order  to  measure channel activity, the <b>aprx</b> program suite has these built-in statistics counter and
       summary estimators.

       The <u>Erlag</u> value that the  estimators  present  are  likely  somewhat  <u>underestimating</u>  the  true  channel
       occupancy  simply  because  it  calculates  estimate  of channel bit transmit rate, and thus a per-minute
       character capacity.  It does not know true frequency of bit-stuffing events of the HDLC framing, nor each
       transmitter pre- and port frame PTT times. The transmitters need to stabilize their transmit  oscillators
       in  many  cases,  which  may take up to around 500 ms!  The counters are not aware of this preamble-, nor
       postamble-times.

       The HDLC bit stuffing ratio is guessed to be 1:1.025 (1 extra bit every 5 bytes)

</pre><h4><b>NOTES:</b> <b>PROGRAM</b> <b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Initially this program had name <u>aprsg-ng</u>, which was too close to another (a less low-tech  C++  approach)
       program had.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS/WARTS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>Erlang</u>-monitor  mechanisms  are  of rudimentary quality, and can seriously underestimate the channel
       occupancy by ignoring pre- and postample transmissions, which can be  as  high  as  50  centiseconds  for
       preample,  and  20  centiseconds  for postample!  When entire packet takes 50 centiseconds, such preample
       alone doubles channel occupancy.  A 6pack protocol on serial link (instead of KISS) could inform receiver
       better on carrier presence times, however even that  underestimates  RF  power  presence  (RSSI)  signal.
       (6pack is not supported.)

       On  serial lines supports really only 8n1 mode, not at all like: 7e1.  On the other hand, there really is
       no sensible usage for anything but 8n1...
