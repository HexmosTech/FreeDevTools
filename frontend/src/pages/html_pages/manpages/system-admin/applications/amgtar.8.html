</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       amgtar - Amanda Application to interface with GNU Tar

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Amgtar is an Amanda Application API script. It should not be run by users directly. It uses GNU Tar to
       backup and restore data.

       The <b>diskdevice</b> in the disklist (DLE) must be the directory to backup.

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b></h4><pre>
       This section lists the properties that control amgtar's functionality. See <b><a href="../man7/amanda-applications.7.html">amanda-applications</a></b>(7) for
       information on application properties and how they are configured.

       ATIME-PRESERVE

           If "YES" (the default), amgtar use the <u>--atime-preserve=system</u> option of gnutar to not update the
           atime of all files accessed; if "NO", gnutar will updates the atime for all files accessed. This
           property works only if you have gnutar 1.15.90 or newer, if not, you must set ATIME_PRESERVE to "NO".

       CHECK-DEVICE

           If "YES" (the default), amgtar checks that the device number doesn't change for each file. If "NO",
           changes in device number are ignored.  To ignore device numbers, tar must support the
           <u>--no-check-device</u> option (gnutar 1.19.90 and newer). This option is needed for some filesystems and
           devices on which device numbers change frequently, such as LVM or FiberChannel.

       COMMAND-OPTIONS
           If set, theses options are passed asis to gtar. Each option must be a different value of the
           property. Some option can break how amanda do backup, use it with care.

           Use:
             property "COMMAND-OPTIONS" "--foo" "bar"

           Do not use:
             property "COMMAND-OPTIONS" "--foo bar"

       DIRECTORY

           If set, gnutar will backup from that directory instead of the <u>diskdevice</u> set by the DLE. On restore,
           the data is restore in that directory instead of the current working directory.

       GNUTAR-LISTDIR

           The directory where gnutar stores the database it uses to generate incremental dumps.  The default is
           set when Amanda is built.

       GNUTAR-PATH

           The path to the gnutar binary.  The default is set when Amanda is built.

       IGNORE-ZEROS

           If "YES" (the default), use the <u>--ignore-zeros</u> argument of gtar on recovery, set it to "NO" if you do
           not want that argument.

       INCLUDE-LIST-GLOB

           A filename containing include glob expression for the restore command.

       EXCLUDE-LIST-GLOB

           A filename containing exclude glob expression for the restore command.

       ONE-FILE-SYSTEM

           If "YES" (the default), do not allow gnutar to cross filesystem boundaries. If "NO", gnutar will
           cross filesystem boundaries.  This corresponds to the <u>--one-filesystem</u> option of gnutar.

       TAR-BLOCKSIZE

           Block size of Nx512 bytes (default N=20).  This corresponds to the <u>--blocking-factor</u> option of
           gnutar.

       SPARSE

           If "YES" (the default), gnutar will store sparse files efficiently. If "NO", then the <u>--sparse</u> option
           is not given to gnutar, and it will not try to detect sparse files.

       NO-UNQUOTE

           If "NO" (the default), gnutar doesn't get the <u>--no-unquote</u> option and the diskname can't have some
           characters, eg. '\'. If "YES", then the <u>--no-unquote</u> option is given to gnutar and the diskname can
           have any characters.  This option is available only if you are using tar-1.16 or newer.

       ACLS

           Default "NO". If "YES", gnutar will preserve ACL extended attributes. This corresponds to the <u>--acls</u>
           gnutar option. Requires a GNU Tar with nonstandard extended attribute patches from the Fedora
           Project.

       SELINUX

           Default "NO". If "YES", gnutar will preserve SELinux extended attributes on Linux. This corresponds
           to the <u>--selinux</u> gnutar option. Requires a GNU Tar with nonstandard extended attribute patches from
           the Fedora Project.

       XATTRS

           Default "NO". If "YES", gnutar will preserve all extended attributes. This corresponds to the
           <u>--xattrs</u> gnutar option. If enabled, this option also implies the ACLS and SELINUX properties,
           regardless of their settings, as they are implemented as extended attributes. Requires a GNU Tar with
           nonstandard extended attribute patches from the Fedora Project.

       EXIT-HANDLING

           List which exit status of gtar are good or bad. eg. "1=GOOD 2=BAD", exit status of 1 will produce a
           good backup, exit status of 2 will give an error.

       NORMAL

           List all regex (POSIX Extended Regular Expression syntax) that are normal output from gtar. These
           output are in the "FAILED DUMP DETAILS" section of the email report if the dump result is STRANGE or
           FAILED. Default values:
             "^could not open conf file"
             "^Elapsed time:"
             "^Throughput"
             ": socket ignored$"
             ": File .* shrunk by [0-9][0-9]* bytes, padding with zeros"
             ": Cannot add file .*: No such file or directory$"
             ": Error exit delayed from previous errors"
             ": directory is on a different filesystem; not dumped"
           To treat one of these default patterns differently, specify it explicitly in a different property.

       IGNORE

           List all regex (POSIX Extended Regular Expression syntax) that amanda ignore. These output are never
           in the email report. Default values:
             ": Directory is new$"
             ": Directory has been renamed"
           To treat one of these default patterns differently, specify it explicitly in a different property.

       STRANGE

           List all regex (POSIX Extended Regular Expression syntax) that are strange output from gtar. All gtar
           output that doesn't match a normal or ignore regex are strange by default. The result of the dump is
           STRANGE if gtar produce a strange output. These output are in the "FAILED DUMP DETAILS" section of
           the email report.

       VERBOSE

           Default: "NO". If "YES", amgtar print more verbose debugging message and can leave temporary files in
           AMANDA_TMPDIR.

</pre><h4><b>INCLUDE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>EXCLUDE</b> <b>LISTS</b></h4><pre>
       This application supplies exclude lists via the <b>GNU-tar</b> <b>--exclude-from</b> option. This option accepts normal
       shell-style wildcard expressions, using <b>*</b> to match any number of characters and <b>?</b>  to match a single
       character. Character classes are represented with <b>[..]</b>, which will match any of the characters in the
       brackets. Expressions can be "anchored" to the base directory of the DLE by prefixing them with "./".
       Without this prefix, they will match at any directory level. Expressions that begin or end with a "/"
       will not match anything: to completely exclude a directory, do not include the trailing slash. Example
       expressions:

         ./temp-files           # exclude top-level directory entirely
         ./temp-files/          # BAD: does nothing
         /temp-files            # BAD: does nothing
         ./temp-files/*         # exclude directory contents; include directory
         temp-files             # exclude anything named "temp-files"
         generated-*            # exclude anything beginning with "generated-"
         *.iso                  # exclude ISO files
         proxy/local/cache      # exclude "cache" in dir "local" in "proxy"

       Similarly, include expressions are supplied to <b>GNU-tar</b>'s <b>--files-from</b> option. This option ordinarily does
       not accept any sort of wildcards, but amgtar "manually" applies glob pattern matching to include
       expressions with only one slash. The expressions must still begin with "./", so this effectively only
       allows expressions like "./[abc]*" or "./*.txt".

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
         define application-tool app_amgtar {
           plugin "amgtar"

           property "ATIME-PRESERVE" "NO"
           property "CHECK-DEVICE" "YES"
           property "GNUTAR-LISTDIR" "/path/to/listdir"
           property "GNUTAR-PATH" "<a href="file:/bin/tar">/bin/tar</a>"
           property "ONE-FILE-SYSTEM" "YES"
           property "TAR-BLOCKSIZE" "20"
           property "SPARSE" "YES"
           property "ACLS" "NO"
           property "SELINUX" "NO"
           property "XATTRS" "NO"
           property "EXIT-HANDLING" "1=GOOD 2=BAD"
           # change a default NORMAL regex to a STRANGE regex.
           property "STRANGE" ": socket ignored$"
           # add three new IGNORE regex
           property "IGNORE" ": Directory is new$"
           property append "IGNORE" ": Directory has been renamed"
           property append "IGNORE" "file changed as we read it$"
         }
       A dumptype using this application might look like:

         define dumptype amgtar_app_dtyp {
           global
           program "APPLICATION"
           application "app_amgtar"
         }
       Note that the <u>program</u> parameter must be set to <u>"APPLICATION"</u> to use the <u>application</u> parameter.
