       ncargpath  -  Return  the full pathname to a given NCAR Graphics directory or the default of a particular
       NCAR Graphics attribute.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ncargpath</b> <b>name</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ncargpath</b> has one argument which is the shortened name of the directory  whose  full  pathname  you  want
       returned  or the name of the attribute whose default value you want.  It is used by several NCAR Graphics
       scripts to find the pathname to certain installables.  For example, the script <b>ncargex</b> uses <b>ncargpath</b>  to
       determine  where  the directory that contains all the examples is installed.  The following arguments are
       recognized:

       bin               Directory where NCAR Graphics binaries are installed.

       config            Directory where NCAR Graphics configuration files are installed.

       data              Directory where NCAR Graphics HLU and NCL example data files are installed.

       database          Directory where NCAR Graphics databases (like the Ezmap database) are installed.

       doc               Directory where NCAR Graphics PostScript documents are installed.

       examples          Directory where NCAR Graphics LLU Fortran and C examples are installed.

       fontcap           The default fontcap being used;  only  returns  a  valid  fontcap  if  the  environment
                         variable FONTCAP is set.

       fontcaps          Directory where NCAR Graphics fontcaps are installed.

       gks_output        The default name of the metafile.

       graphcap          The  default  graphcap  being  used;  only  returns a valid graphcap if the environment
                         variable GRAPHCAP is set.

       graphcaps         Directory where NCAR Graphics graphcaps are installed.

       hluex             Directory where NCAR Graphics HLU Fortran and C examples are installed.

       include           Directory where NCAR Graphics include files are installed.

       lib               Directory where NCAR Graphics libraries are installed.

       man               Directory where NCAR Graphics man pages are installed.

       ncarg             Root directory where NCAR Graphics  examples,  databases,  resource  files,  etc.   are
                         installed.

       nclex             Directory where NCAR Graphics NCL examples are installed.

       ngwww             Directory where NCAR Graphics HTML files are installed (if they were installed).

       ngurl             URL for the NCAR Graphics documentation.

       resfiles          Directory where resource files for the NCL and HLU examples are installed.

       root              Parent directory where NCAR Graphics is installed.

       sysappres         Directory where the NCAR Graphics systems application resource file is installed.

       sysresfile        Directory where the NCAR Graphics system resource file is installed.

       tests             Directory where NCAR Graphics LLU Fortran and C test examples are installed.

       tmp               Directory where NCAR Graphics temporary files will be written.

       tutorial          Directory where NCAR Graphics LLU tutorial C and Fortran examples are installed.

       usrresfile        Directory where the NCAR Graphics user resource file is installed.
