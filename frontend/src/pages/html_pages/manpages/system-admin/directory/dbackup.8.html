</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dbackup — AWIT-DBackup is a powerful per-directory backup utility.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dbackup</b> [<u>GENERAL_OPTIONS</u>]  [--backup <u>BACKUP_OPTIONS</u>  | --restore <u>RESTORE_OPTIONS</u> ]  [<u>SRC</u>]  [<u>DST</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  a  backup  software  package  which  creates  one archive per directory it backs up. This makes
       searching through the backup much easier as you can look for which files you're after  in  the  directory
       hierarchy. It will only backup directories which have changed, which makes it rsync friendly.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--config</b> <u>FILE</u>
                 Configuration file to use.

       <b>--log-level</b>
                 5 = debug, 4 = info, 3 = notice, 2 = warning, 1 = error

       <b>--backup</b>  Perform a backup operation.

       <b>--restore</b> Perform a restore operation.

       <b>--tar</b>     Path  to  tar  binary.  This  should almost never need to be specified, it is used to specify a
                 different tar binary to use other than the default system binary. Some versions of tar used  to
                 have  bugs preventing correct operation, this allowed specification of an alternative binary to
                 use.

       <b>--manifest-format</b>
                 Manifest format to use, currently the two supported formats is "null" for \0 (null) termination
                 of entries or "newline" for \n (newline) termination of entries. This should  not  need  to  be
                 overridden.

       <b>--help</b>    Display commandline help.

</pre><h4><b>BACKUP</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--backup-upgrade</b>
                 Upgrade  backup  to  new  dbackup version. This will cause all archives to be refreshed if they
                 were generated with an older version of AWIT DBackup.

       <b>--compress</b> &lt;gzip|bzip2|xz|lz|none&gt;
                 Compression method to use. Defaults to using xz,  or  bzip2  if  xz  is  unavailable.  Parallel
                 versions  of  these  Compression  programs  will  be  used  if  they  exist.  Here is the order
                 compression programs are looked for: gzip = pigz &gt; gzip, bzip2 = pbzip2 &gt; lbzip2 &gt; bzip2, xz  =
                 pxz &gt; pixz &gt; xz, lz = plzip &gt; pdlzip &gt; clzip.

       <b>--exclude-data</b>
                 Exclude  the most common data directories which contain temporary or state information or which
                 is not useful, a list of these is displayed by running <b>dbackup</b> <b>--help</b>.

       <b>--exclude-system</b>
                 Exclude the most common system directories including <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a>, <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>, <a href="file:/sys">/sys</a>, <a href="file:/run">/run</a>, for the complete
                 list see <b>dbackup</b> <b>--help</b>.

       <b>--exclude-path</b> <u>PCRE</u>
                 Exclude a path based on a Perl regular expression, this should include separators  and  can  be
                 specified multiple times.  eg. --exclude-path=',/old$,'

       <b>--exclude-file</b> <u>PCRE</u>
                 Exclude  files  based  on  a  regular  expression,  this  should  include separators and can be
                 specified multiple times.  eg. --exclude-file='/.bak$/'

       <b>--exclude-fs</b> <u>FSTYPE</u>
                 Exclude filesystem types from being transversed for backup.  This  can  be  specified  multiple
                 times. eg. --exclude-fs=shm

       <b>--system-dir</b> <u>PATH</u>
                 Add  an additional system directory to exclude. The system defaults already include <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a>, <a href="file:/run">/run</a>,
                 /tmp... etc. This can be specified multiple times.

       <b>--data-dir</b> <u>PATH</u>
                 Add an additional data directory to  exclude.  The  data  directory  defaults  already  include
                 /var/lib/mysql,    /var/lib/pgsql,    /var/amavis/tmp/,    /var/spool/squid,    /var/cache/yum,
                 <a href="file:/var/cache/apt/archives">/var/cache/apt/archives</a> ... etc. This can be specified multiple times.

       <b>--system-base</b> <u>PATH</u>
                 System base to apply the exclusions to. This can be specified multiple times.

       <b>--tar-ignore-failed-read</b>
                 This is passed to tar only. It will not cause errors if files that cannot be read.

</pre><h4><b>RESTORE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--tar-keep-newer</b>
                 Pass --keep-newer to tar. Don't replace existing  files  that  are  newer  than  their  archive
                 copies.

       <b>--tar-keep-old-files</b>
                 Pass  --keep-old-files  to  tar.  Don't replace existing files when extracting, rather throw an
                 error.
