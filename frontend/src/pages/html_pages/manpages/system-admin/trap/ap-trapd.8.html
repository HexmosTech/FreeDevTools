</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ap-trapd - a SNMP trap processing daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ap-trapd</b> <b>[</b> <b>-i</b> <u>device</u> <b>]</b> <b>[-u</b> <u>user</u> <b>]</b> <b>[-s]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ap-trapd</b>  It's  a  SNMP trap processing daemon that accepts traps, parse them and store useful data using
       syslog, at logging LEVEL0.  Specify <u>device</u> to listen for SNMP traps on the particular device (this option
       only works at Linux). To be running by user different from nobody you may specify <u>user.</u>
       To correct work with Smartbridges APs specify <u>-s</u> key (they use specific traps).
       Utility added to ap-utils from version 0.8.

</pre><h4><b>SYSLOG</b></h4><pre>
       To store traps to own log file you may add next string to your <b>/etc/syslog.conf</b>
            local0.*       /var/log/ap-traps.log
       After doing it, just restart syslogd with command like
            killall -HUP syslogd

</pre><h4><b>TRAPS</b></h4><pre>
       When a trap is received, a message will be logged indicating that an action happened to the Access  Point
       such as:

       Trap Reassociation:
              This trap message is sent when a Station reassociation request is received from Access Point.

       Trap Association:
              Indicates  the  reception  of  an  association  request packet and the sender Station's successful
              association with the Access Point.

       Trap Disassociation:
              This trap message is sent when a disassociation notification packet is received from a Station.

       Trap Reset:
              This trap message is sent when Access Point Resets.

       Trap Setting IP Address with Ping:
              This trap message is sent when the Access Point IP address is set with the transmission of a  ping
              message.

       Trap Start Up:
              This trap message is sent when the Access Point Starts Up.

              This trap message is sent when Access Point Failed To Erase Flash.
