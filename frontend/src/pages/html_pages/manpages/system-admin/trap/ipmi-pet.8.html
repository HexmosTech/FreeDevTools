</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       IPMI - IPMI Platform Event Trap Interpreter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ipmi-pet</b> [<u>OPTION</u>...] [SPECIFIC TRAP] [VARIABLE BINDING HEX BYTES ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Ipmi-pet</b>  interprets  hex  bytes  from  a platform event trap (PET) and outputs a string representing its
       contents. Hex values may be input on the command line, a file via the <b>--file</b>  option,  or  via  stdin  if
       neither of the previous are specified.  <b>Ipmi-pet</b> is commonly used in conjunction with an SNMP trap daemon
       to  interpret  the  results  from an IPMI PET trap captured by the daemon. While <b>ipmi-pet</b> could be called
       directly from such a daemon, typically a script is called to parse the SNMP daemon's output  and  convert
       it  into  a  form  that  can  be  input  into <b>ipmi-pet.</b>  On some systems, you may wish to also send a PET
       acknowledge to a remote system to inform it the trap was received and parsed. One can be sent  using  the
       <b>--pet-acknowledge</b> option.  While an IPMI session is not required to interpret a PET, data from the sensor
       data  repository  (SDR)  is required to properly interpret sensor names and other information in the PET.
       IPMI session configuration below, such as driver, hostname, username, etc. should be configured  to  load
       the  SDR of the host where the trap originated.  If this is difficult to perform, it may be wise to cache
       and load a specific SDR cache using the <b>--sdr-cache-file</b> option.  If the SDR is difficult to obtain,  the
       <b>--ignore-sdr-cache</b>  option  can  be specified so that an SDR will not be loaded, and an IPMI session will
       not be required. The PET will be interpreted as best as possible given  no  SDR.  The  <b>--ignore-sdr-cache</b>
       option may affect other options such as <b>--interpret-oem-data</b> too. Some options, such as <b>--manufacturer-id</b>
       and  <b>--product-id</b>  may  alleviate  some  of  these  issues.   If the SNMP daemon does not output a SNMPv1
       <u>specific</u> <u>trap</u> on its own, it is typically output as the last element of the OID in SNMPv2.  If  for  some
       reason  a  <u>specific</u>  <u>trap</u>  cannot  be  determined,  the value of <u>NA</u> may be input for the <u>specific</u> <u>trap</u> to
       indicate it is not available.  <b>Ipmi-pet</b> will output as much as possible based on  the  variable  bindings
       information. Some of the specific trap information may be obtained via SDR information.

       Listed  below  are  general IPMI options, tool specific options, trouble shooting information, workaround
       information, examples, and known issues. For a general introduction to FreeIPMI please see <b><a href="../man7/freeipmi.7.html">freeipmi</a>(7).</b>

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are general options for configuring IPMI communication and executing  general  tool
       commands.

       <b>-D</b> <u>IPMIDRIVER</u>, <b>--driver-type</b>=<u>IPMIDRIVER</u>
              Specify  the  driver  type  to  use  instead  of doing an auto selection.  The currently available
              outofband drivers are LAN and LAN_2_0, which perform IPMI  1.5  and  IPMI  2.0  respectively.  The
              currently available inband drivers are KCS, SSIF, OPENIPMI, SUNBMC, and INTELDCMI.

       <b>--disable-auto-probe</b>
              Do not probe in-band IPMI devices for default settings.

       <b>--driver-address</b>=<u>DRIVER-ADDRESS</u>
              Specify  the  in-band driver address to be used instead of the probed value. <u>DRIVER-ADDRESS</u> should
              be prefixed with "0x" for a hex value and '0' for an octal value.

       <b>--driver-device</b>=<u>DEVICE</u>
              Specify the in-band driver device path to be used instead of the probed path.

       <b>--register-spacing</b>=<u>REGISTER-SPACING</u>
              Specify the in-band driver register spacing instead of the probed  value.  Argument  is  in  bytes
              (i.e. 32bit register spacing = 4)

       <b>--target-channel-number</b>=<u>CHANNEL-NUMBER</u>
              Specify the in-band driver target channel number to send IPMI requests to.

       <b>--target-slave-address</b>=<u>SLAVE-ADDRESS</u>
              Specify the in-band driver target slave number to send IPMI requests to.

       <b>-h</b> <u>IPMIHOST,</u> <b>--hostname</b>=<u>IPMIHOST[:PORT]</u>
              Specify  the  remote  host  to  communicate  with. An optional port can be specified, which may be
              useful in port forwarding or similar situations. If specifying an IPv6 address and port,  use  the
              format [ADDRESS]:PORT.

       <b>-u</b> <u>USERNAME</u>, <b>--username</b>=<u>USERNAME</u>
              Specify  the  username  to use when authenticating with the remote host.  If not specified, a null
              (i.e. anonymous) username is assumed. The user must have atleast OPERATOR privileges in order  for
              this tool to operate fully.

       <b>-p</b> <u>PASSWORD</u>, <b>--password</b>=<u>PASSWORD</u>
              Specify  the  password to use when authenticationg with the remote host.  If not specified, a null
              password is assumed. Maximum password length is 16 for IPMI 1.5 and 20 for IPMI 2.0.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--password-prompt</b>
              Prompt for password to avoid possibility of listing it in process lists.

       <b>-k</b> <u>K_G</u>, <b>--k-g</b>=<u>K_G</u>
              Specify the K_g BMC key to use when authenticating with the remote  host  for  IPMI  2.0.  If  not
              specified,  a  null  key  is assumed. To input the key in hexadecimal form, prefix the string with
              '0x'. E.g., the key 'abc' can be entered with the either the string 'abc' or the string '0x616263'

       <b>-K</b>, <b>--k-g-prompt</b>
              Prompt for k-g to avoid possibility of listing it in process lists.

       <b>--session-timeout</b>=<u>MILLISECONDS</u>
              Specify the session timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 20000 milliseconds (20  seconds)  if  not
              specified.

       <b>--retransmission-timeout</b>=<u>MILLISECONDS</u>
              Specify  the  packet  retransmission  timeout  in  milliseconds.  Defaults to 1000 milliseconds (1
              second) if not specified. The retransmission timeout cannot be larger than the session timeout.

       <b>-a</b> <u>AUTHENTICATION-TYPE</u>, <b>--authentication-type</b>=<u>AUTHENTICATION-TYPE</u>
              Specify the IPMI 1.5 authentication type to use. The currently available authentication types  are
              NONE, STRAIGHT_PASSWORD_KEY, MD2, and MD5. Defaults to MD5 if not specified.

       <b>-I</b> <u>CIPHER-SUITE-ID</u>, <b>--cipher-suite-id</b>=<u>CIPHER-SUITE-ID</u>
              Specify  the  IPMI  2.0  cipher  suite  ID  to  use.  The  Cipher  Suite  ID  identifies  a set of
              authentication, integrity, and confidentiality algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0  communication.  The
              authentication  algorithm  identifies  the  algorithm  to  use  for  session  setup, the integrity
              algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for session packet signatures, and  the  confidentiality
              algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher suite ID 3 if
              not specified. The following cipher suite ids are currently supported:

              0 - Authentication Algorithm = None; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None

              1  - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm =
              None

              2 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1;  Integrity  Algorithm  =  HMAC-SHA1-96;  Confidentiality
              Algorithm = None

              3  -  Authentication  Algorithm  =  HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality
              Algorithm = AES-CBC-128

              6 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality  Algorithm  =
              None

              7  -  Authentication  Algorithm  =  HMAC-MD5;  Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality
              Algorithm = None

              8 - Authentication Algorithm =  HMAC-MD5;  Integrity  Algorithm  =  HMAC-MD5-128;  Confidentiality
              Algorithm = AES-CBC-128

              11 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm
              = None

              12 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm
              = AES-CBC-128

              15 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA256; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm
              = None

              16   -   Authentication   Algorithm   =   HMAC-SHA256;   Integrity  Algorithm  =  HMAC_SHA256_128;
              Confidentiality Algorithm = None

              17  -  Authentication  Algorithm   =   HMAC-SHA256;   Integrity   Algorithm   =   HMAC_SHA256_128;
              Confidentiality Algorithm = AES-CBC-128

       <b>-l</b> <u>PRIVILEGE-LEVEL</u>, <b>--privilege-level</b>=<u>PRIVILEGE-LEVEL</u>
              Specify  the  privilege  level  to  be  used.  The  currently available privilege levels are USER,
              OPERATOR, and ADMIN. Defaults to OPERATOR if not specified.

       <b>--config-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Specify an alternate configuration file.

       <b>-W</b> <u>WORKAROUNDS</u>, <b>--workaround-flags</b>=<u>WORKAROUNDS</u>
              Specify workarounds to vendor compliance issues. Multiple workarounds can be  specified  separated
              by  commas. A special command line flag of "none", will indicate no workarounds (may be useful for
              overriding configured defaults). See WORKAROUNDS below for a list of available workarounds.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Turn on debugging.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Output a help list and exit.

       <b>--usage</b>
              Output a usage message and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Output the program version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>IPMI-PET</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are specific to <b>ipmi-pet.</b>

       <b>-v</b>     Output verbose output. This option will output event direction and OEM custom  messages  from  the
              trap.

       <b>-vv</b>    Output  very verbose output. This option will output additional information available in the trap,
              such as GUID, manufacturer ID, and system ID.

       <b>-vvv</b>   Output very very verbose output. This option  will  output  additional  information  than  verbose
              output. Most notably it will output additional hex codes to given information on ambiguous events.
              For example, it will output Generator ID hex codes for sensors without names.

       <b>--pet-acknowledge</b>
              Send  PET  acknowledge using inputted trap data instead of outputting data. In some circumstances,
              this may be useful to inform a remote system that a trap was received and parsed. If specified,  a
              hostname  must  be specified via <u>-h</u> or <u>--hostname</u> to inform <b>ipmi-pet</b> where to send the acknowledge
              to. When this option is specified, the SDR cache is not loaded and is not required.

       <b>--file</b>=<u>CMD-FILE</u>
              Specify a file to read PET specific trap and variable bindings hex from instead of command line.

       <b>--output-event-severity</b>
              Output event severity in output. This will add an additional output  of  an  event  severity.  The
              outputs  may  be  Monitor,  Information,  OK,  Non-critical condition, Critical condition, or Non-
              recoverable condition. This differs from the output of <b>--output-event-state</b>, as event severity  is
              not  interpreted,  it  is  a value reported in the SNMP trap. However, not all events may report a
              severity, or some manufacturers may not support the report of  a  severity.  Event  severity  will
              automatically be output under verbose output.

       <b>--output-event-state</b>
              Output  event  state in output. This will add an additional output reporting if an event should be
              viewed as NOMINAL, WARNING, or CRITICAL. This differs from the output of  <b>--output-event-severity</b>,
              as   this   output   is  an  interpreted  value  that  will  be  interpreted  identically  to  the
              <b>--output-event-state</b> output in <b><a href="../man8/ipmi-sel.8.html">ipmi-sel</a>(8).</b>  As long as an event interpretation is supported,  all
              events  will  have  outputted  state.  The  event  state  is  an  interpreted  value  based on the
              configuration  file  /etc/freeipmi//freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf  and  the  event  direction.   See
              <b><a href="../man5/freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf.5.html">freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf</a>(5)</b> for more information.

       <b>--event-state-config-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Specify  an  alternate  event state configuration file. Option ignored if <b>--output-event-state</b> not
              specified.

       <b>--manufacturer-id</b>=<u>NUMBER</u>
              Specify a specific manufacturer id to assume. Useful if you wish to specify  <b>--interpret-oem-data</b>,
              but  the manufacturer id cannot be determined by IPMI access or is not available in the SNMP trap.
              The manufacturer id of a motherboard can be  determined  with  <b><a href="../man8/bmc-info.8.html">bmc-info</a>(8).</b>   If  this  option  is
              specified, so must <b>--product-id</b>.

       <b>--product-id</b>=<u>NUMBER</u>
              Specify  a  specific product id to assume. Useful if you wish to specify <b>--interpret-oem-data</b>, but
              the product id cannot be determined by IPMI access or is not available  in  the  SNMP  trap.   The
              product  id  of a motherboard can be determined with <b><a href="../man8/bmc-info.8.html">bmc-info</a>(8).</b>  If this option is specified, so
              must <b>--manufacturer-id</b>.

       <b>--interpret-oem-data</b>
              Attempt to interpret OEM data, such as event data, sensor readings, or general extra info, etc. If
              an OEM interpretation is not available, the default output will be generated. Correctness  of  OEM
              interpretations  cannot  be  guaranteed due to potential changes OEM vendors may make in products,
              firmware, etc. See OEM INTERPRETATION below for confirmed supported motherboard interpretations.

       <b>--entity-sensor-names</b>
              Output sensor names prefixed with their entity id and instance number when appropriate.  This  may
              be  necessary  on  some motherboards to help identify what sensors are referencing. For example, a
              motherboard may have multiple sensors named 'TEMP'. The entity id and  instance  number  may  help
              clarify which sensor refers to "Processor 1" vs. "Processor 2".

       <b>--no-sensor-type-output</b>
              Do  not  show  sensor type output for each entry. On many systems, the sensor type is redundant to
              the name of the sensor. This can especially be true if <b>--entity-sensor-names</b> is specified.  If the
              sensor name is sufficient, or if the sensor type is of no interest to the user, this option can be
              specified to condense output.

       <b>--comma-separated-output</b>
              Output fields in comma separated format.

       <b>--no-header-output</b>
              Do not output column headers. May be useful in scripting.

       <b>--non-abbreviated-units</b>
              Output non-abbreviated units (e.g. 'Amps' instead of 'A'). May  aid  in  disambiguation  of  units
              (e.g. 'C' for Celsius or Coulombs).

</pre><h4><b>SDR</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This  tool  requires  access to the sensor data repository (SDR) cache for general operation. By default,
       SDR data will be downloaded and cached on the local machine. The  following  options  apply  to  the  SDR
       cache.

       <b>--flush-cache</b>
              Flush  a cached version of the sensor data repository (SDR) cache. The SDR is typically cached for
              faster subsequent access. However, it may need to be flushed and re-generated if the SDR has  been
              updated on a system.

       <b>--quiet-cache</b>
              Do not output information about cache creation/deletion. May be useful in scripting.

       <b>--sdr-cache-recreate</b>
              If  the  SDR  cache  is  out of date or invalid, automatically recreate the sensor data repository
              (SDR) cache. This option may be useful for scripting purposes.

       <b>--sdr-cache-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Specify a specific sensor data repository (SDR) cache file to be stored  or  read  from.  If  this
              option  is  used  when  multiple hosts are specified, the same SDR cache file will be used for all
              hosts.

       <b>--sdr-cache-directory</b>=<u>DIRECTORY</u>
              Specify an alternate directory for sensor data repository (SDR) caches to be stored or read  from.
              Defaults to the home directory if not specified.

       <b>--ignore-sdr-cache</b>
              Ignore  SDR  cache  related  processing.  May  lead to incomplete or less useful information being
              output, however it will allow functionality for systems without  SDRs  or  when  the  correct  SDR
              cannot be loaded.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       Most often, IPMI problems are due to configuration problems.

       IPMI over LAN problems involve a misconfiguration of the remote machine's BMC.  Double check to make sure
       the  following are configured properly in the remote machine's BMC: IP address, MAC address, subnet mask,
       username, user  enablement,  user  privilege,  password,  LAN  privilege,  LAN  enablement,  and  allowed
       authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0 connections, double check to make sure the cipher suite privilege(s)
       and  K_g  key  are  configured properly. The <b><a href="../man8/ipmi-config.8.html">ipmi-config</a>(8)</b> tool can be used to check and/or change these
       configuration settings.

       Inband IPMI problems are typically caused by improperly configured drivers or non-standard BMCs.

       In addition to the troubleshooting tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below to  also  if  there  are  any
       vendor specific bugs that have been discovered and worked around.

       Listed below are many of the common issues for error messages.  For additional support, please e-mail the
       &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt; mailing list.

       "username  invalid"  -  The username entered (or a NULL username if none was entered) is not available on
       the remote machine. It may also be possible the remote BMC's username configuration is incorrect.

       "password invalid" - The password entered (or a NULL password if none was entered) is not correct. It may
       also be possible the password for the user is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "password verification timeout" - Password verification  has  timed  out.   A  "password  invalid"  error
       (described  above)  or  a generic "session timeout" (described below) occurred.  During this point in the
       protocol it cannot be differentiated which occurred.

       "k_g invalid" - The K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was entered) is not correct. It  may  also
       be possible the K_g key is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "privilege  level  insufficient"  -  An  IPMI  command  requires  a  higher  user  privilege than the one
       authenticated with. Please try to authenticate with a higher privilege. This may  require  authenticating
       to a different user which has a higher maximum privilege.

       "privilege  level  cannot  be  obtained  for  this  user"  -  The  privilege  level you are attempting to
       authenticate with is higher than the maximum allowed for  this  user.  Please  try  again  with  a  lower
       privilege.  It  may  also  be  possible  the maximum privilege level allowed for a user is not configured
       properly on the remote BMC.

       "authentication type unavailable for attempted privilege level" - The authentication  type  you  wish  to
       authenticate  with  is  not  available  for  this  privilege  level.  Please  try again with an alternate
       authentication type or alternate privilege level. It may also be possible  the  available  authentication
       types you can authenticate with are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "cipher suite id unavailable" - The cipher suite id you wish to authenticate with is not available on the
       remote  BMC.  Please  try  again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may also be possible the available
       cipher suite ids are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "ipmi 2.0 unavailable" - IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote machine. Please try to  use  IPMI  1.5
       instead.

       "connection  timeout"  -  Initial  IPMI  communication failed. A number of potential errors are possible,
       including an invalid hostname specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be resolved, IPMI is  not  enabled  on
       the remote server, the network connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration and connectivity.

       "session  timeout"  -  The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect.  If this error occurs often, you
       may wish to increase the retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are considerably slower than others.

       "device not found" - The specified device could not be found. Please check configuration  or  inputs  and
       try again.

       "driver timeout" - Communication with the driver or device has timed out. Please try again.

       "message timeout" - Communication with the driver or device has timed out. Please try again.

       "BMC  busy"  -  The BMC is currently busy. It may be processing information or have too many simultaneous
       sessions to manage. Please wait and try again.

       "could not find inband device" - An inband device could not be  found.   Please  check  configuration  or
       specify specific device or driver on the command line.

       "driver  timeout"  - The inband driver has timed out communicating to the local BMC or service processor.
       The BMC or service processor may be busy or (worst case) possibly non-functioning.

       "internal IPMI error" - An IPMI error has occurred that FreeIPMI does not know how to handle.  Please  e-
       mail &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt; to report the issue.

</pre><h4><b>WORKAROUNDS</b></h4><pre>
       With  so  many  different  vendors implementing their own IPMI solutions, different vendors may implement
       their IPMI protocols incorrectly. The following describes a number of workarounds currently available  to
       handle  discovered  compliance  issues.  When possible, workarounds have been implemented so they will be
       transparent to the user. However, some will require the user to specify a workaround be used via  the  -W
       option.

       The hardware listed below may only indicate the hardware that a problem was discovered on. Newer versions
       of  hardware  may  fix the problems indicated below. Similar machines from vendors may or may not exhibit
       the same problems. Different vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI firmware developer, so
       it may be worthwhile to try workarounds listed below even if your motherboard is not listed.

       If you believe your  hardware  has  an  additional  compliance  issue  that  needs  a  workaround  to  be
       implemented,    please    contact    the    FreeIPMI    maintainers    on   &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt;   or
       &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-devel@gnu.org">freeipmi-devel@gnu.org</a>&gt;.

       <u>assumeio</u> - This workaround flag will assume inband interfaces communicate with  system  I/O  rather  than
       being memory-mapped. This will work around systems that report invalid base addresses. Those hitting this
       issue  may  see  "device  not  supported" or "could not find inband device" errors.  Issue observed on HP
       ProLiant DL145 G1.

       <u>spinpoll</u> - This workaround flag will inform some inband drivers (most notably the  KCS  driver)  to  spin
       while  polling  rather  than  putting the process to sleep. This may significantly improve the wall clock
       running time of tools because an operating system scheduler's granularity may be  much  larger  than  the
       time  it  takes  to  perform  a single IPMI message transaction. However, by spinning, your system may be
       performing less useful work by not contexting out the tool for a more useful task.

       <u>authcap</u> - This  workaround  flag  will  skip  early  checks  for  username  capabilities,  authentication
       capabilities,  and  K_g support and allow IPMI authentication to succeed. It works around multiple issues
       in which the remote system does not properly report username capabilities,  authentication  capabilities,
       or  K_g status. Those hitting this issue may see "username invalid", "authentication type unavailable for
       attempted privilege level", or "k_g invalid" errors.  Issue observed  on  Asus  P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4,
       Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.

       <u>nochecksumcheck</u>  -  This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the checksums returned from IPMI
       command responses. It works around systems that return invalid checksums due  to  implementation  errors,
       but  the  packet  is  otherwise  valid.  Users  are  cautioned  on  the use of this option, as it removes
       validation of packet integrity in a number of circumstances. However, it is unlikely to be  an  issue  in
       most  situations.  Those hitting this issue may see "connection timeout", "session timeout", or "password
       verification timeout" errors. On IPMI 1.5 connections, the "noauthcodecheck" workaround may  also  needed
       too. Issue observed on Supermicro X9SCM-iiF, Supermicro X9DRi-F, and Supermicro X9DRFR.

       <u>idzero</u>  - This workaround flag will allow empty session IDs to be accepted by the client. It works around
       IPMI sessions that report empty session IDs to the client. Those hitting  this  issue  may  see  "session
       timeout" errors. Issue observed on Tyan S2882 with M3289 BMC.

       <u>unexpectedauth</u>  -  This  workaround flag will allow unexpected non-null authcodes to be checked as though
       they were expected. It works around an issue when packets contain non-null authentication data when  they
       should  be  null  due  to  disabled per-message authentication. Those hitting this issue may see "session
       timeout" errors. Issue observed on Dell PowerEdge 2850,SC1425. Confirmed fixed on newer firmware.

       <u>forcepermsg</u> - This workaround flag will force per-message authentication to be used  no  matter  what  is
       advertised  by  the remote system. It works around an issue when per-message authentication is advertised
       as disabled on the remote system, but it is actually required for the protocol. Those hitting this  issue
       may see "session timeout" errors.  Issue observed on IBM eServer 325.

       <u>endianseq</u>  -  This  workaround  flag  will  flip  the endian of the session sequence numbers to allow the
       session to continue properly. It works around IPMI 1.5  session  sequence  numbers  that  are  the  wrong
       endian.   Those  hitting  this  issue  may  see "session timeout" errors. Issue observed on some Sun ILOM
       1.0/2.0 (depends on service processor endian).

       <u>noauthcodecheck</u> - This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the authentication codes  returned
       from  IPMI 1.5 command responses. It works around systems that return invalid authentication codes due to
       hashing or implementation errors. Users are cautioned on the  use  of  this  option,  as  it  removes  an
       authentication check verifying the validity of a packet. However, in most organizations, this is unlikely
       to  be  a  security  issue.  Those hitting this issue may see "connection timeout", "session timeout", or
       "password verification timeout" errors.  Issue observed on Xyratex  FB-H8-SRAY,  Intel  Windmill,  Quanta
       Winterfell, and Wiwynn Windmill.

       <u>intel20</u>  - This workaround flag will work around several Intel IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The issues
       covered include padding of usernames, and password truncation if the authentication  algorithm  is  HMAC-
       MD5-128.  Those  hitting  this  issue  may  see  "username invalid", "password invalid", or "k_g invalid"
       errors. Issue observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module (Professional Edition).

       <u>supermicro20</u> - This workaround flag will work around several Supermicro IPMI 2.0 authentication issues on
       motherboards  w/  Peppercon  IPMI  firmware.  The  issues  covered  include   handling   invalid   length
       authentication  codes.  Those  hitting  this  issue may see "password invalid" errors.  Issue observed on
       Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card. Confirmed fixed on newerver firmware.

       <u>sun20</u> - This workaround flag will work work around several Sun IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The issues
       covered include invalid lengthed hash keys, improperly hashed keys, and  invalid  cipher  suite  records.
       Those  hitting  this  issue may see "password invalid" or "bmc error" errors.  Issue observed on Sun Fire
       4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.  This workaround automatically includes the "opensesspriv" workaround.

       <u>opensesspriv</u> - This workaround flag will slightly  alter  FreeIPMI's  IPMI  2.0  connection  protocol  to
       workaround  an  invalid  hashing algorithm used by the remote system. The privilege level sent during the
       Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0 connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege level sent
       during the RAKP1 connection stage. Those hitting this issue may see "password  invalid",  "k_g  invalid",
       "bad rmcpplus status code", or "privilege level cannot be obtained for this user" errors.  Issue observed
       on  Sun  Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG,
       Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN, Dell C5220,
       and the OpenIPMI software BMC. This workaround is automatically triggered with the "sun20" workaround.

       <u>integritycheckvalue</u> - This workaround flag will work around an invalid integrity check  value  during  an
       IPMI  2.0  session  establishment  when  using  Cipher  Suite ID 0. The integrity check value should be 0
       length, however the remote motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting this issue may  see
       "k_g  invalid"  errors.  Issue observed on Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel S5500WBV/Penguin
       Relion 700, and Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X.

       <u>assumemaxsdrrecordcount</u> - This workaround will inform SDR reading to stop reading after a  known  maximum
       number  of  SDR  records  have  been  read.  This will work around systems that have miss-implemented SDR
       reading functions. Those hitting this issue may see "SDR record count invalid" errors. Issue observed  on
       unspecified Inspur motherboard.

       <u>malformedack</u>  -  This  workaround flag will ignore malformed PET acknowledge responses and assume any PET
       acknowledge response from the remote machine is valid. It works around remote systems that  respond  with
       PET acknowledge requests with invalid/malformed IPMI payloads.  Those hitting this issue may see "session
       timeout" errors when executing a PET acknowledge. Issue observed on Dell Poweredge R610.

       No  IPMI  1.5  Support - Some motherboards that support IPMI 2.0 have been found to not support IPMI 1.5.
       Those hitting this issue may see "ipmi 2.0 unavailable" or "connection timeout" errors. This issue can be
       worked around by using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by specifying <b>--driver-type</b>=<u>LAN_2_0</u>.  Issue  observed
       on a number of HP and Supermicro motherboards.

</pre><h4><b>OEM</b> <b>INTERPRETATION</b></h4><pre>
       The following motherboards are confirmed to have atleast some support by the <b>--interpret-oem-data</b> option.
       While  highly  probable  the  OEM  data  interpretations would work across other motherboards by the same
       manufacturer,  there  are  no  guarantees.  Some  of  the  motherboards  below  may   be   rebranded   by
       vendors/distributors.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful execution, exit status is 0. On error, exit status is 1.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       On older operating systems, if you input your username, password, and other potentially security relevant
       information  on the command line, this information may be discovered by other users when using tools like
       the <b><a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a>(1)</b> command or looking in the <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> file system. It is generally  more  secure  to  input  password
       information  with  options  like  the  -P or -K options. Configuring security relevant information in the
       FreeIPMI configuration file would also be an appropriate way to hide this information.

       In order to prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will temporarily "lock up" after a  number  of  remote
       authentication  errors.  You  may need to wait awhile in order to this temporary "lock up" to pass before
       you may authenticate again.
