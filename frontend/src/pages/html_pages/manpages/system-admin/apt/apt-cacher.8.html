       apt-cacher - caching proxy for Debian packages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Server:</b>
       <b>apt-cacher</b> [<b>-h|--help</b>] [<b>-i|-d</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>configfile</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>pidfile</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>directory</u>] [<b>-R</b> <u>retries</u>]
                  [<b>config_option=foo</b>]

   <b>Client:</b>
       <b><a href="http://apt-cacher.server">http://apt-cacher.server</a>:3142[/apt-cacher]/{mirror}/{distribution}</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Apt-cacher</b> is a caching proxy for Debian packages, allowing a number of computers to share a single
       cache. Packages requested from the cache only need to be downloaded from the Debian mirrors once, no
       matter how many local machines need to install them. This saves network bandwidth, improves performance
       for users, and reduces the load on the mirrors.

       In addition to proxying and caching HTTP requests, apt-cacher can proxy and cache FTP and HTTPS GET/HEAD
       requests, Debian bugs SOAP requests and proxy (but not cache) HTTPS CONNECT requests.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b> <b>configfile</b>
              Specify alternative configuration file to default [/etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf]

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print brief usage.

       <b>-i</b>     Inetd daemon-mode: Only use in /etc/inetd.conf

       <b>-p</b> <b>pidfile</b>
              Write PID of running process to this file.

       <b>-r</b> <b>directory</b>
              Experimental option to chroot to given directory

       <b>-R</b> <b>retries</b>
              Number of attempts to bind to daemon port.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Show version and exit.

       <b>config_option=value</b>
              Override values in configuration file. Can be given multiple times.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Setting  up  apt-cacher  involves  two  stages:  installing apt-cacher itself on a single machine on your
       network to act as a server and configuring all client machines to use the server's cache.

       Apt-cacher can be installed to run either as a daemon [preferred] or as a CGI script on a web server such
       as Apache [deprecated]. When a client (<a href="../man1/apt-get.1.html">apt-get</a>(1), <a href="../man8/aptitude.8.html">aptitude</a>(8), <a href="../man8/synaptic.8.html">synaptic</a>(8) etc.) requests a package from
       the cache machine, the request is handled  by  apt-cacher  which  checks  whether  it  already  has  that
       particular package. If so, the package is returned immediately to the client for installation. If not, or
       if  the  package  in the local cache has been superseded by a more recent version, the package is fetched
       from the specified mirror. While being fetched it is simultaneously streamed  to  the  client,  and  also
       saved to the local cache for future use.

       Other  client machines on your network do not need apt-cacher installed in order to use the server cache.
       The only modification on each client computer is to direct  it  to  use  the  server  cache.  See  CLIENT
       CONFIGURATION below for ways of doing this.

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       Apt-cacher  can be installed in various ways on the server. The recommended way is by running the program
       as a daemon. This should give the best performance and the lowest overall memory usage.

       The easiest method of configuration is to use <a href="../man8/dpkg-reconfigure.8.html">dpkg-reconfigure</a>(8) in which case <a href="../man1/debconf.1.html">debconf</a>(1)  will  do  the
       work for you.

</pre><h4><b>Daemon</b> <b>Modes</b></h4><pre>
       Choose between stand-alone daemon mode where the daemon runs continuously and inetd mode where the daemon
       is run as required by the <a href="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd</a>(8) superserver.

       In either daemon mode, clients can access the server using <b><a href="http://apt-cacher.server">http://apt-cacher.server</a>:port/</b>

   <b>Stand-alone</b> <b>Daemon:</b>
   <b>Inetd</b> <b>Daemon:</b>
       NOTE:  in  inetd  mode  access  control  checks  are not performed and the allowed_hosts and denied_hosts
       options have no effect. Access controls for inetd can be implemented using using inetd or  tcpd  wrapper.
       See <a href="../man5/inetd.conf.5.html">inetd.conf</a>(5) and <a href="../man5/hosts_access.5.html">hosts_access</a>(5) for further details.

</pre><h4><b>CGI</b> <b>Mode</b></h4><pre>
       This  mode  is  deprecated  and not recommended for long-term use because it brings a visible performance
       impact on the network and server speed.  To use it you will need to ensure your webserver  supports  CGI.
       Clients can access the server using <b><a href="http://apt-cacher.server">http://apt-cacher.server</a>[:port]/cgi-bin/apt-cacher/.</b>

       Migration away from deprecated CGI mode can be smoothed using the following configuration options

       <b>cgi_advise_to_use</b> <b>[]</b>
              This is a custom error message that is used to advise clients to use an alternative to CGI.

       <b>cgi_redirect</b> <b>[]</b>
              If  set,  this option is an absolute URL that is used to redirect any CGI requests. It can be used
              to seamlessly redirect CGI access to an instance of apt-cacher running as an INETD or  stand-alone
              daemon.

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Apt-cacher  uses  a  configuration file for setting important options. Additionally there are few command
       line options to control behaviour. See COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS above.

       The default configuration file is <b>/etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf.</b>  It is  read  every  time  the  daemon
       starts  or  an inetd/CGI instance is executed. Therefore a stand-alone daemon may need to be restarted or
       reloaded using the init script in order to reread its configuration. A running daemon  will  also  reread
       the configuration file on receiving SIGHUP (see SIGNALS below).

       As an alternative to editing the configuration file, configuration fragments to override the defaults can
       also  be  placed  in  a directory named conf.d in the same directory as the main configuration file, e.g.
       '/etc/apt-cacher/conf.d/'. Files placed here can have an arbitrary name.  They  are  read  using  <a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a>(7)
       semantics: case-insensitive, ascending ASCII order; dot-files (beginning with '.')  ignored. Also, backup
       files  ending  with  '~'  and  any  files  ending with ´.disabled' or '.dpkg-{old,new,dist,tmp}' are also
       ignored. Duplicate settings read later will override any previous ones.

       Each line in the file consists of

              configuration_option = value

       Long lines can be split by preceding the newlines with '\'. Whitespace is ignored. Lines  beginning  with
       '#'  are  comments  and  are ignored. If multiple assignments of the same option occur, only the last one
       will take effect. For binary options, 0 means off or disabled, any other integer  means  on  or  enabled.
       Options  which  can  accept  lists  may use either ';' or ',' to separate the individual list members. To
       include these separators within a list item escape them with '\'.

       The options available in the config file (and their default settings) are:

   <b>Universal</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>admin_email</b> <b>[root@localhost]</b>
              The email address of the administrator is displayed in the info page and traffic reports.

       <b>allowed_locations</b>
              Only allow access to specific upstream mirrors. The requested URL must match an item in this  list
              for  access  to  be  granted.  The  part  of  the  URL  referring  to the apt-cacher server itself
              (<a href="http://apt-cacher.server">http://apt-cacher.server</a>:port[/apt-cacher]/) is ignored. Matching begins immediately after  that.
              If  '%PATH_MAP%'  in  included  in  this  option,  it will be expanded to the keys of the path_map
              setting. Note this item contains string(s), not regexps.

       <b>allowed_ssl_locations</b> <b>[]</b>
              Only allow HTTPS/SSL proxy CONNECT to hosts or IPs which match an item in this list.

       <b>allowed_ssl_ports</b> <b>[443]</b>
              Only allow HTTPS/SSL proxy CONNECT to ports which match an item in this list. Adding further items
              to this can pose a significant security risk.  DO  NOT  do  it  unless  you  understand  the  full
              implications.

       <b>cache_dir</b> <b>[/var/cache/apt-cacher]</b>
              The directory where apt-cacher will store local copies of all packages requested. This can grow to
              many  hundreds  of  MB,  so  make  sure  it is on a partition with plenty of room. NOTE: the cache
              directory needs to contain some subdirectories for correct storage  management.   If  you  try  to
              create  a  custom  directory,  please  use  the script /usr/share/apt-cacher/install.pl or use the
              initially created cache directory as example.

       <b>concurrent_import_limit</b> <b>[</b><u>Number</u> <u>of</u> <u>CPU</u> <u>cores</u> <u>from</u> <u><a href="file:/proc/cpuinfo">/proc/cpuinfo</a></u> <u>or</u> <u>0</u><b>]</b>
              Importing new checksums can cause high CPU usage on slower systems. This option sets  a  limit  to
              the  number  of  index  files that are imported simultaneously, thereby limiting CPU load average,
              but, possibly, taking longer. Leave unset or set to 0 for no limit.

       <b>checksum</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Switches on checksum validation of cached files. Checksum validation will slow apt-cacher response
              as requested files have to be downloaded completely before validation can occur.  This  slow  down
              can be prevented by setting this value to 'lazy' in which case files will be passed on as they are
              received and checked afterwards. Requires package libberkeleydb-perl to be installed.

       <b>checksum_files_regexp</b> <b>[</b><u>see</u> <u>default</u> <u>/etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf</u><b>]</b>
              Perl  regular  expression (<a href="../man1/perlre.1.html">perlre</a>(1)) which matches the URL filename of all index files from which
              checksums are imported into the checksum database if checksum mode is enabled.

       <b>clean_cache</b> <b>[1]</b>
              Whether to flush obsolete versions of packages from your cache daily. You can check what  will  be
              done by running

                     <b>/usr/share/apt-cacher/apt-cacher-cleanup.pl</b> <b>-s</b>

              which  will  just show what would be done to the contents of the cache. A package is only obsolete
              if none of the (optional) namespaces, distributions (stable, testing, etc)  or  architectures  you
              use reference it.  It should be safe to leave this on.

       <b>curl_idle_timeout</b> <b>[120]</b>
              The maximum time in seconds the libcurl backend will wait, unused, before exiting.

       <b>curl_ssl_insecure</b> <b>[]</b>
              If  this is set to 1, HTTPS GET requests (which are inherently insecure as transfer from the proxy
              to the client is unverified) is even less secure as the libcurl backend  skips  peer  verification
              with the upstream source. You really shouldn't use this. HTTPS CONNECT proxying is more secure.

       <b>curl_throttle</b> <b>[10]</b>
              Controls  how  fast  the libcurl process runs. Increasing this setting will reduce the CPU load of
              the libcurl process, possibly at the expense of slower response times and a lower  throughput.  On
              most systems this option should be left unchanged.

       <b>data_timeout</b> <b>[120]</b>
              Time  in  seconds which, if no data is received from upstream, a request will timeout. This option
              used to be known as fetch_timeout. The old name is still recognised for backwards compatibility.

       <b>debug</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Whether debug mode is enabled. Off by default. When turned  on  (non-nil),  lots  of  extra  debug
              information  will  be  written  to the error log. This can make the error log become quite big, so
              only use it when trying to debug problems. Additional information from the libcurl backend can  be
              obtained  by  increasing this parameter. The correspondence between this setting and curl_infotype
              is:-

              1      CURLINFO_TEXT

              2      CURLINFO_HEADER_IN

              3      CURLINFO_HEADER_OUT

              4      CURLINFO_DATA_IN

              5      CURLINFO_DATA_OUT

              6      CURLINFO_SSL_DATA_IN

              7      CURLINFO_SSL_DATA_OUT

              See CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION in <a href="../man3/curl_easy_setopt.3.html">curl_easy_setopt</a>(3) for further information.

       <b>disk_usage_limit</b> <b>[]</b>
              Optional upper limit for the disk space usage of cache_dir in bytes. Units (k, KiB, M,  MiB  etc.)
              are recognised with the same semantics as the rate limit option above.

       <b>distinct_namespaces</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Set  this to 1 to enable support for caching multiple Distributions (e.g Debian and Ubuntu) from a
              single apt-cacher instance. When enabled, package files are stored in a subdirectory, the name  of
              which  is  derived  from  the  matching key of path_map or the part of the URL preceding 'pool' or
              'dists'. This is typically ´debian', 'ubuntu'  or  'security'.  This  mechanism  prevents  clashes
              between the Distributions.

              If  you  enable  this  option,  any existing namespace specific package files which are not in the
              correct subdirectory of cache_dir would be deleted by apt-cacher-cleanup.pl. If you wish  to  keep
              them and import them into the correct namespace then run (as root)

                     /usr/share/apt-cacher/apt-cacher-import.pl -u {cache_dir}/packages

              If you wish to limit the possible namespaces see path_map.

       <b>expire_hours</b> <b>[0]</b>
              How many hours Package and Release files are cached before they are assumed to be too old and must
              be  re-fetched.  Setting  0  means  that  the validity of these files is checked on each access by
              comparing time stamps in HTTP headers on the server with those stored locally. Use of this setting
              is deprecated as HTTP header validation and sending If-Modified-Requests is much more efficient.

       <b>generate_reports</b> <b>[1]</b>
              Whether to generate traffic reports daily. Traffic reports can be accessed by pointing  a  browser
              to

                     <a href="http://apt-cacher.server">http://apt-cacher.server</a>:3142/report/ [daemon mode]

              or

                     <a href="http://apt-cacher.server">http://apt-cacher.server</a>[:port]/apt-cacher/report/ [CGI mode].

       <b>group</b> <b>[www-data]</b>
              The effective group id to change to.

       <b>http_proxy</b> <b>[]</b>
              Apt-cacher  can  pass  all  its requests to an external http proxy like Squid, which could be very
              useful if you are using an ISP that blocks port 80 and requires all web traffic to go through  its
              proxy. The option takes a URI of the form

                     [protocol://][user[:password]@]hostname[:port]

              The default protocol is http and the default port is 1080.

       <b>http_proxy_auth</b> <b>[]</b>
              External   http   proxy   sometimes  need  authentication  to  get  full  access.  The  format  is
              'username:password', eg: 'proxyuser:proxypass'. This option is  deprecated.  Proxy  authentication
              details should be specified in the http_proxy URI.

       <b>index_files_regexp</b> <b>[</b><u>see</u> <u>default</u> <u>/etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf</u><b>]</b>
              Perl  regular expression (<a href="../man1/perlre.1.html">perlre</a>(1)) which matches the URL filename of all index-type files (files
              that are uniquely identified by their full path and need to be checked for freshness).

       <b>installer_files_regexp</b> <b>[</b><u>see</u> <u>default</u> <u>/etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf</u><b>]</b>
              Perl regular expression (<a href="../man1/perlre.1.html">perlre</a>(1)) which matches the URL filename of all files used by  Aptitude,
              Apt,  the Debian/Ubuntu installer or Debian Live (files that are uniquely identified by their full
              path  but  don't  need  to  be  checked  for  freshness).   Within   this   item   the   shorthand
              '%VALID_UBUNTU_RELEASE_NAMES%'  will be expanded to the list configured in ubuntu_release_names as
              regexp alternatives.

       <b>interface</b> <b>[]</b>
              Specify a particular interface to use for the upstream connection. Can be an  interface  name,  IP
              address or host name. If unset, the default route is used.

       <b>libcurl</b> <b>[]</b>
              This  is  a  list  of  configuration  options  for  the libcurl backend. Each item consists of the
              <a href="../man3/curl_easy_setopt.3.html">curl_easy_setopt</a>(3) option (without the CURLOPT_ prefix) and the desired setting. For example:

                     libcurl = dns_cache_timeout 300, maxredirs 10, noproxy localhost;

              Be very careful with this. Apt-cacher depends on the libcurl backend working in a predictable way.
              You can very easily break things by configuring this.

       <b>limit</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Rate limiting sets the maximum rate in bytes per second used for fetching files from the  upstream
              mirrors.  Optionally,  use SI unit abbreviations ('k', 'M', 'G' etc.) for decimal multiples (1000)
              or 'KiB', 'MiB', or 'GiB' etc. for binary (1024) multiples. Legacy  lowercase  suffixes  based  on
              <a href="../man1/wget.1.html">wget</a>(1)  syntax  are  interpreted as decimal for backwards compatibility, but should be avoided in
              new configurations. Use 0 for no rate limiting. By default this setting is <u>per</u> <u>libcurl</u> <u>connection.</u>
              For global limiting, see limit_global below.

       <b>limit_global</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If set, this makes the specified rate limit apply overall. The libcurl backend does not have  good
              support  for  this,  so  it is implemented by a simple division of the rate by the total number of
              downloads. There is no way for downloads,  dynamically,  to  use  bandwidth  released  by  another
              idle/finished download. If you really want good global bandwidth control, don't use this option at
              all; use traffic shaping instead.

       <b>log_dir</b> <b>[/var/log/apt-cacher]</b>
              Directory to use for the access and error log files and traffic report. The access log records all
              successful  package  requests using a timestamp, whether the request was fulfilled from cache, the
              IP address of the requesting computer, the size of the package transferred, and the  name  of  the
              package.  The  error  log  records  major faults, and is also used for debug messages if the debug
              directive is set to 1. Debugging is toggled by sending SIGUSR1 (see SIGNALS below).

              This option was formerly named  'logdir',  but  was  renamed  for  consistency.  logdir  is  still
              recognised but should not be used for new installations.

       <b>max_loadavg</b> <b>[]</b>
              If  set  this limits the maximum 1 minute loadavg permitted for apt-cacher to attempt to handle an
              client connection.

       <b>offline_mode</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Avoid making any outgoing connections, return files available in the cache or just  return  errors
              if they are missing.

       <b>package_files_regexp</b> <b>[</b><u>see</u> <u>default</u> <u>/etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf</u><b>]</b>
              Perl  regular  expression  (refer  to the <a href="../man1/perlre.1.html">perlre</a>(1) manpage) which matches the URL filename of all
              package-type files (files that are  uniquely  identified,  within  their  Distribution,  by  their
              filename).

       <b>path_map</b> <b>[]</b>
              A  mapping  scheme  to rewrite URLs, which converts the first part of the URL after the apt-cacher
              server name (the key) to a remote mirror. For example, if you set

                     path_map = debian ftp.debian.org/debian

              retrieving

                     <a href="http://apt-cacher.server">http://apt-cacher.server</a>:3142/debian/dists/stable/Release

              will actually fetch

                     <a href="http://apt-cacher.server">http://apt-cacher.server</a>:3142/ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/Release

              If distinct_namespaces is set, then you can use multiple mappings to cache different Distributions
              separately. For example

                     path_map = debian ftp.debian.org/debian; ubuntu archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu

              Multiple, space separated, mirrors can be given for each mapping. They will be tried in  order  in
              the event of failure/unavailability of the previous one. For example

                     path_map = debian ftp.uk.debian.org/debian ftp.debian.org/debian ;

              All  path_map  keys need to be included in allowed_locations, if the latter is used. The shorthand
              '%PATH_MAP%' can be used to simplify this.

              There are 4 internal path_map settings for the Debian and Ubuntu changelog and  AppStream  servers
              which will be merged with the specified configuration:

                     debian-changelogs   packages.debian.org  metadata.ftp-master.debian.org;  ubuntu-changelogs
                     changelogs.ubuntu.com;     debian-appstream     appstream.debian.org;      ubuntu-appstream
                     appstream.ubuntu.com;

              These  can  be  overridden  by  specifying  an alternative mirror for that key, or deleted by just
              specifying the key with no mirror.

       <b>pdiff_files_regexp</b> <b>[</b><u>see</u> <u>default</u> <u>/etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf</u><b>]</b>
              Perl regular expression (<a href="../man1/perlre.1.html">perlre</a>(1)) which matches APT pdiff files. These are <a href="../man1/ed.1.html">ed</a>(1)  scripts  which
              APT use to patch index files rather than redownloading the whole file afresh.

       <b>return_buffer_size</b> <b>[1048576]</b>
              The  buffer  size  that  is used for reads when returning a file using slower read/write loop. The
              default is 1MB. You may wish to adjust this to trade speed against memory consumption. By  default
              files are returned using <a href="../man2/sendfile.2.html">sendfile</a>(2) which is much faster and does not make use of this setting.

       <b>reverse_path_map</b> <b>[1]</b>
              This  setting  enables  a reverse map from the requested URL to the path_map key. It helps prevent
              having multiple copies of the same file cached under different file names.

       <b>skip_checksum_files_regexp</b> <b>[</b><u>see</u> <u>default</u> <u>/etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf</u><b>]</b>
              Perl regular expression (<a href="../man1/perlre.1.html">perlre</a>(1)) which matches the URL filename for which  checksum  validation
              is  not performed. Note that all files matched by installer_files_regexp are automatically skipped
              and do not need to be added here as well.

       <b>soap_url_regexp</b> <b>[</b><u>see</u> <u>default</u> <u>/etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf</u><b>]</b>
              Perl regular expression (<a href="../man1/perlre.1.html">perlre</a>(1)) which matches URLs that are permitted as upstream  source  for
              <a href="../man1/apt-listbugs.1.html">apt-listbugs</a>(1) requests.

              <a href="../man1/apt-listbugs.1.html">apt-listbugs</a>(1)  makes  requests  to  the Debian Bugs server via SOAP POST requests. These are not
              cached, but are simply passed through as a convenience.

       <b>supported_archs</b> <b>[</b><u>see</u> <u>default</u> <u>/etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf</u><b>]</b>
              A list of Architectures that is supported and you wish to allow in fetched  filenames.  ´all´  and
              ´any´  are  automatically  added  to  this  list  which  is  then  used to expand %VALID_ARCHS% in
              *_files_regexp.

       <b>use_proxy</b> <b>use_proxy_auth</b> <b>[obsolete]</b>
              Use of external proxy and proxy authentication used to be turned on or  off  with  these  options.
              They are now ignored and an upstream proxy will always be used if configured.

       <b>use_sendfile</b> <b>[</b><u>Sys::Syscall::sendfile_defined()</u><b>]</b>
              By default, if <a href="../man2/sendfile.2.html">sendfile</a>(2) is available on the system, it is used to return files to client and is
              much  more  efficient  than  read/write. The default, which is determined by the value returned by
              Sys::Syscall::sendfile_defined() can be explicitly overridden.

       <b>user</b> <b>[www-data]</b>
              The effective user id to change to after allocating the ports.

   <b>Stand-alone</b> <b>Daemon-mode</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>allowed_hosts</b> <b>[]</b>
              If your apt-cacher server is directly  connected  to  the  Internet  and  you  are  worried  about
              unauthorised  fetching  of  packages  through it, you can specify a range of IP addresses that are
              allowed to use it. Localhost (127.0.0.1/8, ::1) is always allowed, other addresses must be matched
              by allowed_hosts and not by denied_hosts to be permitted to use the cache. This option  can  be  a
              single  item,  list, IP address with netmask or IP range, resolvable hostname, or ´*' to allow all
              access. See the default configuration file for further details and examples.

       <b>allowed_hosts_6</b>
              Deprecated option analogous to allowed_hosts, but for IPv6 clients.  allowed_hosts  can  now  take
              IPv6 addresses directly.

       <b>daemon_addr</b> <b>[]</b>
              The  daemon  can  be  restricted  to listen only on particular local IP address(es). If unset, the
              daemon will listen on all available addresses. Single item or list of IPs. Use with care.

       <b>daemon_port</b> <b>[3142]</b>
              The TCP port to bind to.

       <b>denied_hosts</b>
              The opposite of allowed_hosts setting, excludes hosts from the list of allowed hosts. Not used  in
              inetd daemon mode.

       <b>denied_hosts_6</b>
              Deprecated  option analogous to denied_hosts, but for IPv6 clients. denied_hosts can now take IPv6
              addresses directly.

       <b>request_empty_lines</b> <b>[5]</b>
              The number of empty lines tolerated before an incoming connection is closed.

       <b>request_timeout</b> <b>[30]</b>
              Maximum time in seconds that will be waited for a incoming request before closing the connection.

</pre><h4><b>CLIENT</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       There are two different ways of configuring clients to use apt-cacher's cache. Ensure that you do not use
       a mixture of both methods. Changing both proxy settings and base URLs can create some confusion.

       <b>Access</b> <b>cache</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b>
              To use the cache in this way, edit <a href="file:/etc/apt/sources.list">/etc/apt/sources.list</a> on each client and prepend the address of
              the apt-cacher server to each deb/src line. This mode is limited to using HTTP  protocol  for  the
              upstream source.

              For example, if you have:

                     deb <a href="http://ftp.debian.org">http://ftp.debian.org</a> stable main

              change it to read either

                     deb <a href="http://apt-cacher.server">http://apt-cacher.server</a>[:port]/ftp.debian.org stable main [server in daemon mode]

              or

                     deb  <a href="http://apt-cacher.server">http://apt-cacher.server</a>[:port]/apt-cacher/ftp.debian.org  stable  main [server in CGI
                     mode]

       <b>Access</b> <b>cache</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>proxy</b>
              For clients to use the cache in this way, set the apt-cacher server as a proxy on each  client  by
              setting the proxy URL in apt.conf. For example:

                     Acquire::http::Proxy "<a href="http://apt-cacher.server">http://apt-cacher.server</a>:port";

              See <a href="../man5/apt.conf.5.html">apt.conf</a>(5) for further details.

              It is not recommended to set the http_proxy environment variable as this may effect a wide variety
              of applications using a variety of URLs. Apt-cacher will not work as a general purpose web cache!

              In  this  mode  apt-cacher  supports  HTTP,  FTP,  HTTPS  CONNECT,  HTTPS GET and Debian Bugs SOAP
              proxying.

</pre><h4><b>FAQ</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Q:</b> <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>copy</b> <b>some</b> <b>.debs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cache</b> <b>dir</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>work?</b>

       A: Almost! A bit additional work is also required to make them usable and persistent in the cache.

       First: alongside with the .debs apt-cacher stores the HTTP headers that were sent from  the  server.   If
       you copy .debs straight into the storage directory and don't add those things, fetching them *will* fail.

       Fortunately  Apt-cacher now comes with an import helper script to make things easier. Just put a bunch of
       .debs into /var/cache/apt-cacher/import (or a directory called 'import' inside whatever you've  set  your
       cache  dir to be), and run /usr/share/apt-cacher/apt-cacher-import.pl (you can specify alternative source
       directory with the first parameter). The script will run through all the package files it finds  in  that
       dir  and  move them around to the correct locations plus create additional flag/header files. Run it with
       "-h" to get more information about how to use additional features -- it can work in recursive mode  while
       discovering the files and save space by making links to files located elsewhere in the filesystem.

       Second:  if  the  daily  cleanup  operation  is  enabled  (see  clean_cache option above) and there is no
       Packages.gz (or .bz2) file that refers to the new files, the package files will be removed  really  soon.
       From  another  point  of  view: if there are potential clients that would download these packages and the
       clients did run "apt-get update" using apt-cacher once, there is no reason to worry.

       <b>Q:</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>invalid/corrupt</b> <b>file</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cache,</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>remove</b> <b>it?</b>

       A: There are several possibilities for this:

       1)     In either daemon mode, apt-cacher tries to be a well-behaved cache and respects Cache-Control  and
              Pragma  headers. Refreshing a file can be forced by adding Cache-Control: no-cache to the request.
              The easiest way of doing this is with the --no-cache option of <a href="../man1/wget.1.html">wget</a>(1), for example:

                     wget -O/dev/null --no-cache <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:3142/debian/dists/stable/Release

       2)     Enable checksumming which will validate cached files as they are fetched.

       3)     Wait until after apt-cacher-cleanup.pl has run (which should remove invalid files).

       4)     Manually delete the file from /var/cache/apt-cacher/packages.

       <b>Q:</b> <b>Does</b> <b>the</b> <b>daily</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> <b>or</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> <b>cache</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b>  <b>whether</b>  <b>apt-cacher</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>running</b>
       <b>continuously</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>daemon?</b>

       A: No, the regular maintenance jobs are independent of a running server. They are executed by <a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron</a>(8) and
       use only static data like logs and cached index files and package directory listing.  However, apt-cacher
       should  be  configured  correctly  because  cleanup  runs  it  directly  (in  inetd  mode) to refresh the
       Packages/Sources files.

       <b>Q:</b> <b>Are</b> <b>host</b> <b>names</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>file?</b>

       A: Since 1.7.0 DNS resolvable hostnames are permissible.

       Unlike with some other software like Apache, the access control is slightly different because there is no
       configurable checking order. Instead, a client host is checked  using  both  filters,  allowed_hosts  and
       denied_hosts.  Following combinations are possible: allowed_hosts=* and denied_hosts is empty, then every
       host is allowed; allowed_hosts=&lt;ip data&gt; and denied_hosts=empty, then only defined hosts  are  permitted;
       allowed_hosts=*  and  denied_hosts=&lt;ip  data&gt;,  then  every  host  is accepted except of those matched by
       denied_hosts;  allowed_hosts=&lt;ip  data&gt;  and  denied_hosts=&lt;ip  data&gt;,  then  only   the   clients   from
       allowed_hosts  are  accepted  except  of  those  matched  by  denied_hosts.  allowed_hosts=&lt;empty&gt; blocks
       everything (except localhost). denied_hosts must not have an "*" value, use empty  allowed_hosts  setting
       if you want that.

       <b>Q:</b>  <b>generate_reports:</b>  <b>how</b>  <b>does</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> <b>reports</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>web</b> <b>server</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>running?</b>
       <b>Are</b> <b>they</b> <b>only</b> <b>available</b> <b>if</b> <b>apt-cacher</b> is running on port 80?

       The report is  generated  using  a  script  (started  by  a  cron  job,  see  above)  and  is  stored  as
       $log_dir/report.html.  You  can  access  it  using the "/report" path in the access URL. If apt-cacher is
       running     in     CGI     mode,     then     the     URL     for     the     browser     looks      like
       <b><a href="http://apt-cacher.server">http://apt-cacher.server</a>[:port]/apt-cacher/report/.</b>

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Apt-cacher  currently  handles  forwarding GET requests to HTTP, FTP and HTTPS sources. Support for other
       access methods (ssh, rsync) is not currently planned.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       Apt-cacher handles the following signals:

       <b>HUP</b>    Causes the configuration file to be re-read.

       <b>USR1</b>   Toggles printing of debug output to /var/log/apt-cacher/error.log

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf</b>
              main configuration file

       <b>/etc/apt-cacher/conf.d/</b>
