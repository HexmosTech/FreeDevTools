</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       aprsdigi - APRS(™) digipeater

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>aprsdigi</b> <u>options</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Aprsdigi</u>  is  a  specialized  Amateur Packet Radio (AX.25) UI-frame digipeater for the Automatic Position
       Reporting Systems, APRS(tm).  It uses the Linux kernel AX.25 network stack as  well  as  the  SOCK_PACKET
       facility  to  listen for packets on one or more radio interfaces (ports) and repeat those packets -- with
       several possible modifications -- on the same or other interfaces.  <u>Aprsdigi</u> can also use the Internet to
       tunnel connections among other APRS digipeaters and nodes using IPv4 or IPv6 UDP unicast or multicast.

       <u>Aprsdigi</u> implements conventional packet radio AX.25 digipeating, in which a packet is digipeated  if  the
       next  hop (non-repeated) digipeater ("via") callsign matches the AX.25 port's callsign and sub-station ID
       (SSID) or an <u>alias</u> callsign and SSID.

       There are a number of extensions to conventional digipeating that have been proposed for use in the  APRS
       community.   Some  of  these  features have been adopted by Terminal Node Controller (TNC) manufacturers,
       notably Paccomm and Kantronics.  <u>Aprsdigi</u> implements most if not  all  of  the  commercialy  adopted  and
       proposed  features.   See the APRS 1.0 Protocol Specification at www.tapr.org for protocol documentation.
       <u>Aprsdigi</u> attempts to minimally comply with the protocol specification as  well  as  support  experimental
       APRS features.  Specific features implemented include:

       • Single-interface conventional UI-frame digipeating.

       • Cross-interface digipeating (also known as bridging, routing or gatewaying) and one-to-many fanout.

       • Substitution  of  a digipeated alias with the interface's callsign (typically used to substitute <b>RELAY,</b>
         <b>WIDE</b> or <b>TRACE</b> aliases).

       • <b>WIDEn-n</b> flooding algorithm.

       • <b>TRACEn-n</b> route recording.

       • <u>Mic-Encoder(tm)</u>  support,  including  SSID-based  digipeating,  decompression  of  packets   into   the
         conventional  APRS MIM format.  (The Mic-Encoder compression is also used by other products such as the
         Kenwood TH-D7A and D700, and TAPR PIC-Encoder).

       • TheNet X1J4 node beacon text translation (removal of the “TheNet X1J4 (alias)” prefix from the btext).

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v</b> <b>--verbose</b>
                 Produce verbose debugging output.

       <b>-T</b> <b>--testing</b>
                 Test mode: listen to my packets too.  This mode  is  useful  for  off-air  experimentation  and
                 configuration testing.  Do not use it on-air.

       <b>-D</b> <b>--kill_dupes</b>
                 Suppress Duplicate packets.  Remembers duplicate packets for the number of seconds given by the
                 -k option and will not repeat them more than once.  This reduces conjestion caused when several
                 digipeaters that share a common flooding alias (e.g. WIDE) have overlapping footprints, causing
                 geometric duplication of packets addressed via “WIDE,WIDE” for example.

       <b>-L</b> <b>--kill_loops</b>
                 Suppress  Looping packets.  Similar in function to duplicate packet suppression, but looks back
                 through the list of already digipeated callsigns in the packet's digipeat list  and  kills  any
                 packets  that  list  a  callsign belonging to this <u>aprsdigi.</u>  Note that only real callsigns are
                 compared.  Generic flooding aliases are not.  Therefore, loop detection  is  only  useful  when
                 callsign substitution is used.

       <b>-V</b> <b>--version</b>
                 Print program version and exit.

       <b>-n|s|e|w</b> <b>--north|south|east|west</b>
                 Set North|South|East|West SSID directional path.

       <b>-d</b> <b>--digipath</b>
                 Set  SSID omnidirectional next-hops when operating in a non flooding network (e.g. when WIDEn-n
                 is not an option).

       <b>-W</b> <b>--floodnlimit</b>
                 Limit each flooding alias to this many hops to limit  traffic  from  excessive  specifications.
                 Default is off.

       <b>-f</b> <b>--flood</b>
                 Set flooding alias.  Use “-f WIDE” to enable WIDEn-n flooding.  Use -f multiple times to define
                 several flooding aliases.

       <b>-F</b> <b>--trace</b>
                 Set  flooding  trace  callsign.   Use  “-F TRACE” to enable TRACE and TRACEn-n flooding. Use -F
                 multiple times to define several trace aliases.

       <b>-k</b> <b>--keep</b> <b>secs</b>
                 Remember old packets for this long for duplicate packet detection.  Default is 28 seconds.

       <b>-H</b> <b>--hops</b> <b>digipeats</b>
                 Limit the total number of digipeats a packet that comes to us direct can request.   This  value
                 is  compared  to  the sum of the hops computed from the via list.  Those packets exceeding this
                 value are suppressed.  Packets relayed to us by other digipeaters are not affected.  Default is
                 no limit.

       <b>-l</b> <b>--logfile</b> <b>file</b>
                 Log digipeated packets to this file.

</pre><h4><b>PER-INTERFACE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Put these options <u>before</u> each <b>-p</b> <b>--interface</b> to set new  values  as  needed.   The  values  you  set  are
       remembered for subsequent <b>-p's</b> so options you want to set for all interfaces need only be specified once,
       before  the  first  <b>-p.</b>   But  you  have  to remember to unset an option if you don't want it to apply to
       subsequent interfaces.

       <b>-C</b> <b>(-c)</b> <b>--[no]subst_mycall</b>
                 Do  (not)  perform  callsign  substitution.   When  enabled,  aliases  are  replaced  with  the
                 interface's callsign when repeated.

       <b>-M</b> <b>(-m)</b> <b>--[no]mice_xlate</b>
                 Do (not) perform Mic-E to MIM translation.  When enabled, compressed Mic-E reports are expanded
                 into one MIM-style position report packet and optionally a second telemetry packet if telemetry
                 was supplied in the Mic-E packet.

       <b>-X</b> <b>(-x)</b> <b>--[no]x1j4_xlate</b>
                 Do  (not)  perform  X1J4  translation.  When enabled, the leading “TheNet X1J4 (alias)” text is
                 removed when digipeated.  This allows non-compliant APRS  implementations  to  detect  an  APRS
                 position report in an X1J4 beacon.

       <b>-i</b> <b>--idinterval</b> <b>secs</b>
                 Seconds  between  ID transmissions.  Set to 0 to disable IDs on this interface.  Default is 570
                 (9 minutes 30 seconds).  IDs are only sent if the interface transmitted anything since the last
                 ID.  ID packets are addressed to the “ID”  callsign,  have  no  digipeat  path,  and  list  the
                 callsign and aliases for the interface the ID is being transmitted on.

       <b>-t</b> <b>--tag</b> <b>text</b>
                 Text  to  append to received packets.  Use <u>-t</u> <u>-</u> to reset to empty.  Use this, for example, when
                 gatewaying Mic-E packets from a voice repeater to the APRS net frequency to indicate where  the
                 report originated.

       <b>-3</b> <b>--3rdparty</b>
                 Enable 3rd party tunneling.  Packets tunneled <u>to</u> a 3rd party interface are sent with the unused
                 digipeaters removed from the digipeater list.  Packets tunneled <u>from</u> a 3rd party interface have
                 the Source Path Header prepended to the packet payload prefixed by the "}" character.

       <b>-0</b> <b>--no3rdparty</b>
                 Enable  transparent  tunneling.  No special tricks are done when sending to or receiving from a
                 tunneled interface.  If the interface does not natively support AX.25 addresses (from-call, to-
                 call, and digipeater list), then the address header is prepended to  the  payload  in  "cooked"
                 format. Likewise, a cooked prepended header is stripped from a cooked interface and put back in
                 the AX.25 address when going from a non-AX.25 to AX.25 interface.

       <b>-o</b> <b>r</b> <b>--norx</b>
                 Disable receiving on the following interface(s).

       <b>-o</b> <b>R</b> <b>--rx</b> Enable receiving on the following interface(s).

       <b>-o</b> <b>t</b> <b>--notx</b>
                 Disable transmitting on the following interface(s).

       <b>-o</b> <b>T</b> <b>--tx</b> Enable transmitting on the following interface(s).

       <b>-o</b> <b>s</b> <b>--notxsame</b>
                 Disable retransmitting a received packet on the same interface.

       <b>-o</b> <b>S</b> <b>--txsame</b>
                 Enable retransmitting a received packet on the same interface.

       <b>-o</b> <b>d</b> <b>--duplicate</b> <b>intf</b>
                 Duplicate received packets without modification to the given interface (port).

       <b>-p</b> <b>--interface</b> <b>ax25:port:alias1,alias2,...</b>
                 AX25 interface name (port) and optional list of aliases.  The primary callsign is obtained from
                 the interface's configuration.  (See <a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a>(8)).

       <b>-p</b> <b>--interface</b> <b>udp:host/port/ttl:alias1,alias2,...</b>
                 IP  host name or address and list of aliases.  IP addresses may be IPv4 unicast or multicast or
                 IPv6 unicast.  The primary callsign is obtained from the first alias.

       <b>-p</b> <b>--interface</b> <b>unix:filename:alias1,alias2,...</b>
                 Unix file and list of aliases.  Useful for debugging by setting up a simulated APRS network  on
                 one  machine.   You  may  want to make your FIFOs explicitly transmit- or receive-only to avoid
                 confusion.  The primary callsign is obtained from the first alias.

       <b>-B|b</b> <b>--[no]bud</b>
                 <u>addr</u> Is similar to a TNC-2's BUDLIST.  Use <b>-B</b> <b>--bud</b> to accept or <b>-b</b> <b>--nobud</b> to  ignore  packets
                 from  a  sender  or group of senders.  Budlists are attached to each interface and can be reset
                 with <b>--bud</b> <b>-</b>
                 You can set up a global budlist once, or per-interface budlists.  The  format  of  <u>addr</u>  varies
                 based on the interface type:

       <b>--bud</b>   <b>ax25:callsign-ssid</b>  matches  only  a  given  digipeater  callsign  and  SSID.   For  example,  -B
                 ax25:n0clu-14.

       <b>--bud</b> <b>ax25:callsign</b> matches all SSIDs for the given callsign.  For example -B ax25:n0clu.

       <b>--bud</b> <b>ip:hostname</b> matches one Internet host name (IPv6 or IPv4).  For example -B ip:n0clu.ampr.net

       <b>--bud</b> <b>ip:address/maskbits</b> matches all IP addresses  that  have  the  given  prefix.   For  example  --bud
                 ip:44.0.0.0/8  matches  the entire class-A network.  --bud ip:192.168.0.0/16 matches the entire
                 class-B  network.   --bud  ip:fe80::201:3ff:fe9a:38c6  matches  a  single  IPv6  host.    --bud
                 ip:2002:905::/32 matches the 32-bit IPv6 prefix.

</pre><h4><b>RUNTIME</b> <b>CONTROLS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>aprsdigi</u> responds to the following signals:

       <b>SIGUSR1</b>   Print  cumulative  statistics.   For  each  port, the following counters are displayed: packets
                 received and how many of those where ignored,  duplicates,  loops,  mic-E  formatted;   packets
                 transmitted  and  how many of those where conventional digipeats, flooding digipeats (WIDEn-n),
                 SSID-based digipeats, and IDs.  If a log file was specified with the <b>-l</b> <b>--logfile</b> option,  then
                 the statistics are written to that file.  Otherwise they are written to stderr.

       <b>SIGUSR2</b>   Prints the statistics and then resets all counters to zero.

       All other normal termination signals cause final statistics to print before <u>aprsdigi</u> exits.

</pre><h4><b>SSID-BASED</b> <b>ROUTING</b></h4><pre>
       SSID-based  routing  uses a non-zero sub-station ID in the destination callsign, an empty digipeater path
       to indicate that the APRS digipeater should repeat the packet after filling in an appropriate  digipeater
       path.   For  example,  a packet sent to “T1QS4W-3” would be repeated with a modified destination of “APRS
       VIA WIDE3-3” (in a network that supports WIDEn-n flooding).  A packet sent to “APRS-11” would be repeated
       to the West unproto path, as defined with the <b>--west</b> option.  A table of  SSID  values  and  their  paths
       follows:

       SSID unproto path
       ---- ------------
       0    none
       1    WIDE1-1
       2    WIDE2-2
       3    WIDE3-3
       4    WIDE4-4
       5    WIDE5-5
       6    WIDE6-6
       7    WIDE7-7
       8    NORTH UNPROTO path
       9    SOUTH UNPROTO path
       10   EAST  UNPROTO path
       11   WEST  UNPROTO path
       12   NORTH UNPROTO path + WIDE
       13   SOUTH UNPROTO path + WIDE
       14   EAST  UNPROTO path + WIDE
       15   WEST  UNPROTO path + WIDE

       SSID digipeating was first introduced with the Mic-Encoder but works with any destination callsign with a
       non-zero SSID.  The theory behind destination SSID digipeating is described in more detail in the APRSdos
       README, MIC-E.TXT.  Basically, the idea is to minimize packet lengths and to have the manager of the WIDE
       APRS  digipeater  determine the most appropriate directional digipeat paths, removing the burden from the
       mobile user.

       <u>Aprsdigi</u> also fits into a non WIDEn-n network by using the same algorithm  for  selection  of  subset  of
       digipeaters  from  a  list supplied with the <b>--digipath</b> option as the MIC-E.  That is, SSIDs of 1, 2 or 3
       select that number of digipeaters from the first three digipeaters in the <b>--digipath</b> list.  SSIDs  of  4,
       5, 6, or 7, start at the fourth digipeater in the list.

</pre><h4><b>FLOODING</b> <b>ALIASES</b></h4><pre>
       APRS  flooding (WIDEn-n) digipeating works by repeating any received packet whose next hop digipeater has
       a flooding alias (specified with the <b>--flood</b> option), and  the  SSID  is  1  or  greater.   The  SSID  is
       decremented  by  one,  and  the  packet  is repeated.  Furthermore, to prevent broadcast storms, recently
       transmitted packets are remembered for a period of time specified  by  the  <b>--keep</b>  option  and  are  not
       repeated if they are heard within that time period.

       Unlike  conventional  digipeating,  in  which the digipeater callsign/alias is flagged as “repeated”, the
       flooding mode does not do this.  Once the SSID decrements to zero, then a flooding alias is treated  just
       like any other alias, and does get marked as repeated upon transmission.

</pre><h4><b>TRACE</b> <b>and</b> <b>TRACEn-n</b> <b>ALIASES</b></h4><pre>
       “Flooding”  Trace  aliases (TRACEn-n; <b>--trace</b> option) are treated like flooding aliases with the addition
       that, besides decrementing the SSID, the current interface's callsign is inserted in front of  the  trace
       alias,  providing a record-route function.  “Plain” trace aliases (TRACE; also <b>--trace</b> option) are simply
       substituted in the conventional ( <b>--subst_mycall</b> ) manner.

</pre><h4><b>MULTI</b> <b>PORT</b> <b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       In single port operation, there is only one  interface  specified  with  <b>--interface.</b>   All  packets  are
       received  and  some are retransmitted on the same interface, depending on whether they match the criteria
       for retransmission after translation of the digpeater path from one of the APRS-specific formats:

       • Mic-E TO-call SSID-based route.

       • WIDEn-n/TRACEn-n flooding.

       or a conventional next-hop (non-repeated) digipeater matching the callsign or one of the aliases for  the
       interface.

       The  decision to transmit is made by matching the next hop callsign/alias with the table of callsigns and
       aliases you supply to <b>--interface.</b>

       In multi-port operation, this  same  technique  simply  extends  to  several  interfaces.   Besides  each
       interface's  unique  callsign, you can give the same alias to several interfaces.  This results in a one-
       to-many fanout which might be useful for dual  frequency  operation  such  as  a  general  use  APRS  net
       frequency and an event-specific frequency.

       By  using  different flags for Mic-E expansions, etc. you can tailor these fanouts differently on each of
       these interfaces, perhaps keeping Mic-E packets compressed on one frequency while decompressing  them  on
       another.

</pre><h4><b>DUPLICATING</b> <b>PACKETS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>--dupe</b> <b>intf</b> option will duplicate a packet received on one interface to the interface name given.  If
       you  want  to duplicate to several other interface, repeat <b>--dupe</b> <b>intf</b> for each interface.  The packet is
       duplicated verbatim as received.  No callsign substitution, flooding or other processing or checking such
       as whether the packet still has any non-repeated digipeaters in the list is  checked.   This  feature  is
       meant to provide a means to simply repeat received packets verbatim, on an RF interface, for example, out
       an  interface  that  might  be  an  Ethernet,  that  has APRS client applications running on it (or <u>aprsd</u>
       listening on a UDP interface).  Digipeating without the normal processing  can  be  dangerous  since  the
       digipeater  list  is never used up.  Because of this, packets received on a given interface will never be
       blindly duplicated back to the same interface, regardless of the option setting.

</pre><h4><b>TRACE</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>TRACEN-N</b></h4><pre>
       Note that TRACEn-n vs. plain TRACE do different things: TRACEn-n *inserts* calls into the digipath  while
       decrementing ssid, e.g.:
            RELAY*,TRACE3-3
            RELAY,N2YGK-7*,TRACE3-2
            RELAY,N2YGK-7,WB2ZII*,TRACE3-1
            RELAY,N2YGK-7,WB2ZII,N2MH-15,TRACE3*

</pre><h4><b>KILLING</b> <b>LOOPING</b> <b>PACKETS</b></h4><pre>
       Kill looping packets (--kill_loops option):
            RELAY*,WIDE,WIDE,WIDE
            RELAY,N2YGK-7*,WIDE,WIDE
            RELAY,N2YGK-7,WIDE*,WIDE
       Normally  n2ygk-7  would  respond  to  this, but, by finding one of mycall earlier in the path, I know to
       ignore it.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Following is a sample invocation of <u>aprsdigi</u> running on two ports.  This  is  a  contrived  example  that
       tries to show all the features.  Comments to the right describe each feature.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Aprsdigi</u>  should  not  be confused with a Wes Johnson's DOS program of the same name.  This code has most
       recently been tested with the Linux 2.4.20 kernel under Red Hat Fedora Core 1.  The command  line  syntax
       is  ugly  and will eventually be replaced by a configuration file.  Short options are deprecated and will
       disappear in a future release.  Please use long options.
