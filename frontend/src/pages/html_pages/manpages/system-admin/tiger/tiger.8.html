       tiger - UNIX Security Checker

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tiger</b>  [<b>-vthqGSH</b>]  [<b>-B</b>  <u>dir</u>]  [<b>-l</b>  <u>dir</u>|<u>@host</u>] [<b>-w</b> <u>dir</u>] [<b>-b</b> <u>dir</u>] [<b>-e</b>|<b>-E</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>config</u>] [<b>-A</b> <u>arch</u>] [<b>-O</b> <u>os</u>] [<b>-R</b>
       <u>release</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Tiger is a package consisting of Bourne Shell scripts, C code and data files which is used  for  checking
       for  security  problems  on  a  UNIX system.  It scans system configuration files, file systems, and user
       configuration files for possible security problems and reports them.  The command <b><a href="../man8/tigexp.8.html">tigexp</a></b>(8) can  be  used
       to obtain explanations of the problems reported by <b>tiger</b>.

       You  can  configure <b>tiger</b> by adjusting the <b>Tiger_</b> variables in the <u>/etc/tiger/tigerrc</u> configuration file.
       For each available module (see <b>MODULES</b> below) there is a corresponding variable in the configuration file
       that determines whether the module is run. All of the variables names start with <b>Tiger_check_</b> and  should
       be  set  equal to Y to run, or N to skip. Other configuration variables will modify the behaviour of some
       modules, and should be adjusted based on the operating system.

       The <u>/etc/tiger/tiger.ignore</u> configuration file defines a set of messages that will not  be  presented  in
       the  report even if any of the modules generate them.  If the file exists, all the entries (line by line)
       are used as extended regular expressions that are compared against each  message  (notice  that  it  will
       introduce  some  overhead which grows with the size of the file).  For more information on this mechanism
       read the <u>README.ignore</u> document.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following arguments can be used when calling the program:

       <b>-B</b> <u>tigerdir</u>
              Specify the directory where <b>tiger</b> is installed.  If not specified, /usr/lib/tiger is used.

       <b>-l</b> <u>logdir</u>|<u>@logserver</u>
              Specify the name of the directory where <b>tiger</b> will write the security report.   This  defaults  to
              /var/log/tiger.      The     filename     of     the     report    will    be    of    the    form
              'security.report.<u>hostname.date.time</u>'.  If the  directory  begins  with  a  <b>@</b>,  the  name  will  be
              interpreted  as a tiger logging server.  Tiger logging's server is currently a server that listens
              in port (tcp) 5353 on a remote host.  The tiger process will just send the results to that  server
              using a telnet connection.

       <b>-w</b> <u>workdir</u>
              Specify a directory to use for creating scratch files.  This defaults to <u>/var/lib/tiger/work</u>.

       <b>-b</b> <u>bindir</u>
              Specify  the directory which contains (or will contain) the binaries generated from the C modules.
              If the systems directories contain all the binaries, they will be used directly  from  there.   If
              not, then if <u>bindir</u> contains the binaries, these will be used.  If none are found in either place,
              then an attempt will be made to compile the C code and install the executables into <u>bindir</u>.

       <b>-c</b> <u>tigerrc</u>
              Specify an alternate name for the <u>tigerrc</u> control file.  The default is '/etc/tiger/tigerrc'.

       <b>-e</b>     This  option  will  cause  explanations  to  be  inserted  into the security report following each
              message.  This can greatly increase the size of the report, as explanations may appear repeatedly.

       <b>-E</b>     This option indicates that a separate explanation report should be created, with explanations  for
              each  type  of message only appearing once.  The filename of the explanation report will be of the
              form 'explain.report.<u>hostname.date.time</u>'.

       <b>-G</b>     Generate the signatures (MD5 hashes and file permissions) for system binary files.

       <b>-H</b>     This option will format the report into HTML creating local links to the problem descriptions.

       <b>-S</b>     This option indicates that a surface level check  of  the  configuration  files  of  any  diskless
              clients  served  by this machine should be checked at the same time.  The checks will not be as in
              depth as they would be if run on the client itself.

       <b>-q</b>     Suppress messages to be as quiet as possible, only security messages will be shown.

       <u>-A</u> <u>arch</u>
              This option overrides the default value obtained for the  current  architecture  detected  by  the
              internal configuration engine to a value defined by the user.

       <u>-O</u> <u>os</u>  This  option overrides the default value obtained for the current operating system detected by the
              internal configuration engine to a value defined by the user.

       <u>-R</u> <u>release</u>
              This option overrides the default value obtained for the current operating system release detected
              by the internal configuration engine to a value defined by the user.

       Notice that changing the real values for the operating system and architecture <b>Tiger</b> is running in  might
       result  in  scripts  being  run  which  are not appropriate to it, and, as a consequence, unexpected (and
       potentially dangerous) errors might be generated. When executed <b>Tiger</b> will show which  operating  system,
       release and architecture thinks it is running in.

</pre><h4><b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tiger</b> is composed of a series of modules. Each of these modules check specific security issues related to
       UNIX  systems.   The  framework  provided by <b>Tiger</b> allows the provision of both generic modules and those
       specific for the operating system the software runs in. Modules can be executed stand alone, from cron or
       through the <b>tiger</b> program (which will execute all those available).

       If you want to write additional modules for your system read the <u>README.writemodules</u> document.

       <b>Tiger</b> currently provides the following modules:

       <b>check_accounts</b>
              Checks the accounts provided in the system, looking  for  disabled  accounts  with  cron,  rhosts,
              .forward, and valid shells.

       <b>check_aliases</b>
              Performs a check for mail aliases and improper configuration.

       <b>check_anonftp</b>
              Determines if the anonymous FTP service is properly configured.

       <b>check_cron</b>
              Validates the cron entries in the system.

       <b>check_embedded</b>
              Determines if embedded pathnames are configured properly.

       <b>check_exports</b>
              Analyses configuration files for NFS exported filesystems to see if access is properly restricted.

       <b>check_group</b>
              Checks the UNIX groups available in the system, looking for conflicts and improper entries.

       <b>check_inetd</b>
              Checks  the inetd configuration file: compares against services definition, valid directory paths,
              non-existent binaries and active services.

       <b>check_known</b>
              Looks for known intrusion signs including backdoors and mail spools.

       <b>check_netrc</b>
              Checks if users's netrc files are insecurely configured.

       <b>check_nisplus</b>
              Looks for wrong configuration in the NIS+ entries.

       <b>check_passwd</b>
              Checks the UNIX users available in the system, looking for conflicts and improper entries.

       <b>check_path</b>
              Validates the binaries in user's PATHs as well as PATH definitions used by  scripts  in  order  to
              determine insecure definitions.

       <b>check_perms</b>
              Check filepermissions and inconsistencies.

       <b>check_printcap</b>
              Analyses the configuration for the printer control file.

       <b>check_rhosts</b>
              Checks rhosts files in order to see if user's configuration leaves the system open to attack.

       <b>check_sendmail</b>
              Checks  sendmail  configuration  files.  <b>check_signatures</b> Compares binary files signatures against
              those stored in the local database (provided with the program).

       <b>check_system</b>
              This module calls the operating system's specific modules available at <b>/usr/lib/tiger/systems/</b>.

       <b>check_apache</b>
              Checks the <b>Apache</b> configuration file and reports on generic issues which might introduce exposures
              or vulnerabilities in the system.

       <b>check_devices</b>
              Checks for devices's permissions, warning about devices that have world permissions.

       <b>check_exrc</b>
              Analyses .exrc files that are not in user's home directories. The <b>vi</b> command  will  look  for  the
              existence  of such a file in the current directory, and so may inadvertently perform commands that
              can compromise your system's security when starting <b>vi</b> or <b>ex</b>.

       <b>check_finddeleted</b>
              Checks if deleted files are being used by any process in the current  system.  This  might  be  an
              indication  of  intrusion (a user executing processes and then deleting its files) or of unpatched
              servers (which, if not restarted use old library files and are still vulnerable).

       <b>check_ftpusers</b>
              Analyses the system's /etc/ftpusers and determines if the administrative users are in that file.

       <b>check_issue</b>
              Checks the <a href="file:/etc/issue">/etc/issue</a> and <a href="file:/etc/issue.net">/etc/issue.net</a> file to determine if they contain the appropriate content
              (this is defined in the ISSUEFILE and ISSUENETFILE).

       <b>check_logfiles</b>
              Checks for the existence of log files (wtmp, btmp, lastlog and utmp).   It  will  also  check  for
              proper umask settings.

       <b>check_bootloader</b>
              Analyses configuration files for different bootloaders including lilo and grub (Linux-specific).

       <b>check_listeningprocs</b>
              Checks  for processes listening on TCP/IP sockets (servers) in the system as well as users running
              them. Will warn if the user running a server is  not  an  authorised  one  or  if  the  server  is
              listening on all available interfaces.

       <b>check_passwdformat</b>
              Checks  the format of the <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> file in order to determine inconsistencies which indicate an
              intrusion or misconfiguration.

       <b>check_patches</b>
              Checks if patches are available for the system (i.e.  new  packages).   It  will  use  autorpm  or
              apt-get  to  check  this (so this tools need to be properly configured). This check is specific to
              Linux (RedHat or Debian).

       <b>check_root</b>
              Checks if remote root login is allowed to the local system.

       <b>check_rootdir</b>
              Checks the permissions for the root directory.

       <b>check_rootkit</b>
              Tries to find systems which have been rootkited, it does so by looking for trojaned  <b>ls</b>  and  <b>find</b>
              commands.   It  also  includes  a  wrapper to run the <b>chkrootkit</b> program and format the results in
              Tiger's message format.

       <b>check_single</b>
              Checks if the system is properly configured to disallow single-user access. This check is specific
              to Linux.

       <b>check_release</b>
              Analyses the version of the operating system and determines if it is too out of date.  This  check
              is specific to Linux (RedHat or Debian).

       <b>check_runprocs</b>
              This module will check if the processes configured in <u>tigerrc</u> are running currently in the system.
              If  any  of  the  processes  is  not  running,  <b>Tiger</b>  will warn the administrator (this acts as a
              lightweight software watchdog)

       <b>check_services</b>
              Check which services are configured in the system (usually in <a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a>) versus the ones  that
              should be configured (in the provided services file)

       <b>check_tcpd</b>
              Tests  for  the  existence  of  tcp-wrappers and changes in their configuration it also determines
              which services are running wrapped in tcp-wrappers.

       <b>check_umask</b>
              Check for umask setting in configuration files.

       <b>check_xinetd</b>
              Checks which xinetd services are enabled or disabled.

       <b>crack_run</b>
              Runs a local installation of the <b>Crack</b> program which can  be  used  to  determine  if  local  user
              passwords are easy (or not) to guess.

       <b>tripwire_run</b> <b>aide_run</b> <b>integrit_run</b>
              Wrappers  for  a number of integrity checkers, these programs enhance the support of <b>Tiger</b> for MD5
              and SHA-1  binary  signatures  and  file  system  permission  checks  (implemented  with  the  the
              <b>check_perms</b>  and  <b>check_signatures</b>  scripts).   You  should consider installing any of these three
              programs (<b>Tripwire</b>, <b>Aide</b> or <b>Integrit</b>) and use read-only locations (such as CD-ROM)  to  store  the
              hashes of the system.

       <b>deb_checkmd5sums</b>
              Compares the MD5 sums of binary files against those provided after installation.  Changes in these
              files might be an indication of a compromised system (Debian-specific).

       <b>deb_nopackfiles</b>
              Looks  for  files  installed  in  the  system's directories that are not provided by any installed
              Debian packages (Debian-specific).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/tiger/tigerrc</u>
              Configuration file for the <b>Tiger</b> tool.

       <u>/etc/tiger/cronrc</u>
              Configuration file for the <b>Tigercron</b> tool.

       <u>/var/log/tiger</u>
              Location of the log messages generated by <b>Tiger</b> when run through <b>cron</b>.

       <u>/var/lib/tiger/work</u>
              Working directory used by <b>Tiger</b> scripts to create temporary files.

       <u>/etc/tiger/tiger.ignore</u>

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man8/tigexp.8.html">tigexp</a></b>(8)

       There  are also a number of <u>README</u> files that describe in detail the behaviour of <b>Tiger</b> and how it can be
       used to setup a host-based intrusion detection system. These can be found in the  top  directory  of  the
       sources  or  in <b>/usr/lib/tiger</b> once it is installed (in Debian the location of the full documentation set
       is <b>/usr/share/doc/tiger/</b>)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There are a lot more things to check.

       Some places in the package are not shell meta-character or white-space safe.

       You can report or read known bugs at the <u><a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/tiger">http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/tiger</a></u> webpage.

       For  Debian-specific  (known)  bugs  read  the   <u>/usr/share/doc/tiger/README.Debian</u>   document   or   the

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tiger</b>  was  originally  developed  by  a  team  of  the  Texas A&amp;M University Supercomputer Center, as of
       September 1993, the development done via the Network Group, Computing &amp; Information Services.

       This software was written originally by Douglas Lee Schales, Dave K. Hess, Khalid Warraich, and  Dave  R.
       Safford (circa 1993).

       A  <b>lot</b>  of  changes  were  introduced  by  the  ARSC  team (a.k.a. the TARA team) Liam Forbes &lt;lforbes at
       arsc.edu&gt;, Nathan Bills &lt;bills AT arsc.edu&gt; and  Mike  Kienenberger  &lt;mkienenb  at  arsc.edu&gt;,  including
       support for quite a number of operating systems.

       Current  upstream maintenance of <b>Tiger</b> is being done by Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Peña and coordinated at
       <u><a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/tiger">http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/tiger</a></u>.

       The adaptation for the GNU/Linux operating system was made by Robert L. Ziegler &lt;rlz at mediaone.net&gt;

       The modifications for the Debian GNU/Linux operating system have been made by  Javier  Fernandez-Sanguino
       Peña  &lt;jfs  at  computer.org&gt;,  including  a  number  of  checks  for  the  GNU/Linux  operating  systems
       (<b>check_listeningprocs</b>)  and  some  specific  for  Debian   (<b>deb_checkadvisories</b>,   <b>deb_checkmd5sums</b>   and
       <b>deb_nopackfiles</b>).
