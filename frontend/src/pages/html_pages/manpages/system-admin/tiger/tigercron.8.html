</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tigercron - Cron utility for Tiger UNIX Security Checker

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tigercron</b> [<u>controlfile</u>] [<b>-B</b> <u>basedir</u>] [<u>tigeroptions</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tigercron</b>  is  used  to  run  periodically checks from the Tiger UNIX Security Checker. <b>Tigercron</b> reads a
       control file which is usually located in '/etc/tiger/cronrc' although it can also be specificied  as  the
       first  argument  when  calling  the program.  The format of this control file is the same as for the <b>cron</b>
       program, each line indicates when different checks from <b>Tiger</b> will be run.  The user can  indicate  where
       Tiger is installed through the <b>-B</b> <b>basedir</b> parameter, any other additional options provided in the command
       line will be passed on to configure to configure <b>Tiger</b> based on them (as described in <b>tiger</b> <b>(8)</b>).

       <b>Tigercron</b>  runs  the  specified  checks  and  compares  their reports with previous stored reports (under
       /var/log/tiger). It will then  mail  the  user  defined  in  '/etc/tiger/tigerrc'  (<u>Tiger_Mail_RCPT</u>)  the
       results.

       When a module is run, <b>tigercron</b> checks:

       •   If  <u>Tiger_Cron_Template</u>  is  set  to Y in tigerrc. If it is, it checks if there is a template stating
           which are the expected results.

       •   If <u>Tiger_Cron_CheckPrev</u> is set to Y in tigerrc. If it is, it checks if there is a previous run of the
           module it can check against.

       A differential report is generated depending on the module reports and previous run and is  sent  through
       e-mail.  These reports provide an easy way to detect intrusions even if no configuration of templates has
       been done. In the event of an intrusion a <b>Tiger</b> check might detect something specific (file changes,  new
       processes,  new  users, etc.) and this alert mechanism provides a way to turn <b>Tiger</b> into a Host Intrusion
       Detection System (HIDS).

       The ability of it to work as a proper HIDS is based on a good customization of the cronrc  file.  Modules
       that  check events to which the host is most exposed to should be run often in order to detect deviations
       from normal behaviour.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tigercron</b> uses the same options as <b>Tiger</b>. A controlfile can be defined also to override the default.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/tiger/tigerrc</u>
              Configuration file for the <b>Tiger</b> tool.

       <u>/etc/tiger/cronrc</u>
              Configuration file for the <u>Tigercron</u> tool.

       <u>/var/log/tiger</u>
              Location of the log messages generated by <b>Tiger</b> when run through <u>cron</u>

       <u>/var/lib/tiger/work</u>
              Working directory used by <b>Tiger</b> scripts to create temporary files.

       The deficiencies of using <b>tigercron</b> as a HIDS are described in the file README.hostids which is  provided
       with  the  package.  In  Debian  GNU/Linux  you  will  find  this  (and  other  related) documentation at
       /usr/share/doc/tiger/

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Currently <b>Tigercron</b> has only one alert mechanism (mail) and signatures are not  supported.  Thus,  alerts
       could be faked. Also, it is dependent on <b>cron</b> and will not work if <b>cron</b> is not working.
