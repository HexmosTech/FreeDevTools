       amreport - generate a formatted output of statistics for an Amanda run

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>amreport</b> [<b>-o</b> <u>configoption</u>...] [(1) <u>command-line</u> <u>options</u> | (2) <u>script</u> <u>options</u>] [<u>config</u>]

       (1) [--log=<u>logfile</u>] [--format=<u>MODULE:DEST,DEST-ARG</u>] [--ps=<u>filename</u>] [--text=<u>filename</u>] [--xml=<u>filename</u>]
           [--print=<u>printer</u>] [--mail-text=<u>recipient</u>]

       (2) [-i] [-M <u>address</u>] [-l <u>logfile</u>] [-f <u>outputfile</u>] [-p <u>postscriptfile</u>] [--from-amdump]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Amreport</b> generates a summary report of an Amanda backup run.

       See the <b><a href="../man8/amanda.8.html">amanda</a></b>(8) man page for more details about Amanda.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>config</u>
           Name of the configuration to process. If no configuration name is specified, amanda.conf is read from
           the current directory.

       <b>-o</b> <u>configoption</u>
           See the "CONFIGURATION OVERRIDE" section in <b><a href="../man8/amanda.8.html">amanda</a></b>(8).

       Amreport operates in two distinct modes. Command-line mode is intended for use by an administrator from
       the command line, and uses long command-line options for clarity. Script mode is intended for use from
       scripts such as amdump, and has a lot of non-obvious default behaviors to suit that need.

       Unless a script-mode option is given, amreport defaults to command-line mode. If no options are given,
       amreport writes a report for the most recent logfile to stdout.

   <b>Command-Line</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--log=</b><u>logfile</u>
           Use this logfile as the basis for the report. If this option is given, then the report is a
           "historical" report and will not include current state from e.g., holding disk and curinfo. If this
           option is not specified, then the most recent logfile will be used.

       <b>--format=</b><u>MODULE:DEST,DEST-ARG</u>
           Use the given perl module to format the report and send it to DEST with the given DEST-ARG.

           Valid module provided with amanda are: human, json, json_raw, ps and xml, valid destination are file,
           mail and print, the DEST-ARG depend on the destination.

           The default destination is file.

           The default arg for file destination is '-' (stdout).

           The default arg for mail destination is the MAILTO configuration option.

           The default arg for print destination is the PRINTER configuration option.

           Examples:
             <b>--format=</b><u>human</u>
             <b>--format=</b><u>human:mail</u>
             <b>--format=</b><u>human:mail:root</u>
             <b>--format=</b><u>human:file:/tmp/report.text</u>
             <b>--format=</b><u>xml:file:/tmp/report.xml</u>
             <b>--format=</b><u>ps:file:/tmp/report.ps</u>
             <b>--format=</b><u>ps:print:lp</u>

       <b>--ps=</b><u>filename</u>
           Write a postscript label to <u>filename</u>. See "LABEL PRINTING" below. If filename is not specified, then
           the label is written to stdout.

           Same as --format=ps, --format=ps:file:filename

       <b>--text=</b><u>filename</u>
           Write a human-readable text report to <u>filename</u>. If filename is not specified, then the report is
           written to stdout.

           Same as --format=human, --format=human:file:filename

       <b>--xml=</b><u>filename</u>
           Write an XML-formatted report to <u>filename</u>. If filename is not specified, then the report is written
           to stdout.

           Same as --format=xml, --format=xml:file:filename

       <b>--print=</b><u>printer</u>
           Pipe a postscript label to <b>lp</b> or <b>lpr</b>, specifying the given <u>printer</u>. If the printer is not specified,
           uses the default from the Amanda configuration, or the system default printer.

           Same as --format=ps:print, --format=ps:print:printer

       <b>--mail-text=</b><u>recipient</u>
           Send a human-readable text report to the given <u>recipient</u> via the mailer specified in the Amanda
           configuration. If the recipient is not specified, this uses the <u>mailto</u> from the Amanda configuration.

           Same as --format=human:mail, --format=human:mail:recipient

   <b>Script</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-i</b>
           Don't email the report.

       <b>-M</b> <u>address</u>
           Mail the report to <u>address</u> instead of the <b>mailto</b> value from <u>amanda.conf</u>.

       <b>-l</b> <u>logfile</u>
           Name of the log file to parse to generate the report. If a log file is not specified, it defaults to
           the file $logdir/log, where $logdir is the log directory defined in amanda.conf.

       <b>-f</b> <u>outputfile</u>
           Normally, <b>amreport</b> sends the report via e-mail to the <u>mailto</u> user as defined in the amanda.conf file.
           If <u>outputfile</u> is specified, then the report is put in <u>outputfile</u>.

       <b>-p</b> <u>postscriptfile</u>
           Send the postscript output to the file <u>postscriptfile</u> instead of to the <b><a href="../man1/lpr.1.html">lpr</a></b>(1) command. This option
           has an effect only if the <u>lbl-templ</u> directive is specified in amanda.conf.

       <b>--from-amdump</b>
           Force script mode. Has no other effect.

</pre><h4><b>TEXT</b> <b>REPORT</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Amanda's text report format is divided into several sections. Some of these sections only appear if they
       are not empty.

       Although newer versions of Amanda try to use the term "volume" to refer to a unit of storage, amreport
       still uses the term "tape", even if backups are done to non-tape devices, to allow scripts which parse
       amreport's output to continue to function.

   <b>Summary</b>
       Hostname: bkserver
       Org     : DailySet1
       Config  : Daily
       Date    : February 25, 2009

       These dumps were to tape Daily-103.
       The next tape Amanda expects to use is: Daily-142

       FAILURE DUMP SUMMARY:
          jamon.slikon.local <a href="file:/var">/var</a> lev 0  FAILED [<a href="file:/bin/tar">/bin/tar</a> exited with status 2]

       The summary section describes the run in broad terms, giving the server hostname, organization (from the
       <b>org</b> configuration parameter), configuration name, and dump date. This is followed by a description of the
       volumes and holding disk used, and an rough estimate of the volume(s) Amanda will use on the next run.

       Brief notices of any unusual circumstances will also be included here.

       This section contains aggregate statistics for the entire run. The three columns break down the results
       into a total for all data handled, only full dumps, and only incremental dumps. In the right margin,
       amreport indicates the breakdown of dump levels at the dumper and the taper.

       The rows have the following meanings:

       Estimate Time
           The time used by the planner to estimate dump sizes.

       Run Time
           Total runtime, from the invocation of amdump to its completion.

       Dump Time
           Total time spent dumping clients.

       Output Size
           Total quantity of data dumped, after compression.

       Original Size
           Total quantity of data dumped, before compression.

       Avg Compressed Size
           Compression ratio, calculated from the previous two rows.

       Filesystems Dumped
           Number of DLEs dumped.

       Avg Dump Rate
           Average speed at which clients produced data. Note that, for dumps done directly to a slow device,
           rather than to holding disk, this rate may reflect a write speed constrained by the device speed.

       Tape Time
           Total time spent writing to storage volumes. This includes time spent changing tapes, including time
           spent waiting for flush thresholds to be met.

       Tape Size
           Total quantity of data written to storage volumes.

       Tape Used
           Fraction of the total allocated storage (tapetype length times runtapes) actually used.

       Filesystems Taped
           Number of filesystems written to storage. This may be larger or smaller than the number of
           filesystems dumped, due to flushes or dumps left on holding disk.

       Parts Taped
           Number of split parts writtten to storage. If this number is very large, then the split size may be
           too small.

       Avg Tp Write Rate
           Taper speed, based on the tape time and tape size, above. Note that, because the tape time includes
           time spent on tasks other than writing to tape, this does not necessary reflect the device's real
           write speed. However, the value is useful for capacity planning, as it reflects a realistic estimate
           of how quickly Amanda can write data to storage.

   <b>Usage</b> <b>by</b> <b>Tape</b>
       USAGE BY TAPE:
         Label          Time      Size      %  DLEs Parts

         Conf-002       0:00     6470k   21.1     0     2

       This short section gives per-volume statistics: time spent writing to the volume; bytes written to the
       volume; portion of the expected tape length used; number of DLEs started, and total number of split parts
       written.

   <b>Notes</b>
       NOTES:
         taper: tape DAILY-37 kb 30720 fm 3 [OK]

       This section contains any informational log messages from the run. Most messages are self-explanatory.
       The taper message shown in the example is always present, and is redundant to the previous section. It
       indicates that 30720 kb were written to "DAILY-37" in 3 files.

       This section expands on failures and strange results indicated in earlier sections. In both cases, the
       details contain a messages produced by the underlying backup tool - GNU tar, in this example. Failed
       dumps have actually failed, and the reasons are usually clear. Strange dumps, however, are regarded as
       successful by Amanda, but contain messages that Amanda did not recognize and which may be of interest to
       the operator.

   <b>Dump</b> <b>Summary</b>
       DUMP SUMMARY:

       The dump summary table has one row for each DLE processed during the run. The "L" column gives the level
       of the dump. The remaining colums are divided into dumper stats and taper stats.

       The dumper stats give the original (before compression) and output (after compression) size of each dump,
       as well as a compression ratio, if applicable. The column labeled "MMM:SS" gives the time spent on that
       dump, and the next column is the calculated dump rate.

       The taper stats give the time and speed with which the dump was written to storage. This value is the sum
       of the times for each part, and as such does not include time spent switching volumes.

</pre><h4><b>LABEL</b> <b>PRINTING</b></h4><pre>
       Amanda can print postscript labels describing the contents of tape(s) written in a run. The labels are
       designed to be folded and inserted into the tape case along with the tape or hole punched and put in a
       3-ring binder. Various label templates are provided to format data for different tape sizes.

       The information printed varies slightly between label templates due to size constraints. Labels contain
       one line for each host/file-system pair and may also contain the file number on the tape, the level of
       the dump, the original size of the dump and the size of the (possibly compressed) tape file.

       Add the <u>lbl-templ</u> parameter to the tapetype definition in amanda.conf to enable labels. If you don't add
       this line to your tapetype definition, <b>amreport</b> will not print tape labels.

       You may use the <u>printer</u> keyword in amanda.conf to print to other than the system default printer.

</pre><h4><b>TEMPLATES</b></h4><pre>
       Amanda provides label templates for the following tape types. These are pretty generic labels and should
       be easy to customize for other tape types or particular site needs.

           * ExaByte 8mm tapes
           * DAT 4mm tapes
           * DLT tapes
           * 3-ring binder

       The 3-ring binder type is the most generic. It may be used to make a hardcopy log of the tapes.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODE</b></h4><pre>
       The exit code of <b>amreport</b> is the ORed value of:
        0  = success
        1  = error
        2  = a dle give strange message
        4  = a dle failed
        8  = Don't know the status of a dle (RESULT_MISSING in the report)
        16 = tape error or no more tape
