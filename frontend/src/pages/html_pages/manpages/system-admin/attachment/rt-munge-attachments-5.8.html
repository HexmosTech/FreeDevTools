       rt-munge-attachments - Remove or replace strings in attachment records

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           rt-munge-attachments --search="<a href="mailto:user1@example.com">user1@example.com</a>" --replace="<a href="mailto:removed-user@example.com">removed-user@example.com</a>"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In RT, "attachments" contain all correspondence on tickets, not just file-based attachments. Although
       attachments are normally not modified by RT once created, this script provides a way to change or remove
       personalized data like email addresses that might be contained in the headers or bodies of RT attachment
       records. This allows admins to comply with GDPR regulations, but retain ticket histories with remaining
       non-personal information.

       A transaction is recorded when this script modifies content so there is a record that something was
       changed on the ticket. Details of the change are not recorded since the values would likely contain
       personal information which the script was run to remove.

       If modifying ticket history violates audit policies, admins should not use this script.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --search=SEARCH
           Provide  a  string  to search the header and content columns in the attachments table.  If a match is
           found the content will be removed unless a replacement is provided.

       --replace=REPLACEMENT
           Provide a string to replace the value matched by the search.

       --tickets=1,2,3
           Limit attachments to the specified tickets. Note that if tickets or transactions are  not  specified,
           RT  will pre-filter attachments by the search string use SQL, which might bypass attachments of which
           contents are encoded(like base64). Use this option to prevent the pre-filter behavior.

       --transactions=123,456,7
           Limit attachments to the specified transactions. If  specified  the  default  pre-filtering  will  be
           prevented. This option can work alongside the --tickets flag.

       --skip-headers
           By default headers are also munged, to disable munging of headers set the --skip-headers flag.

       --skip-content
           By default transaction content is munged, to disable munging of content set the --skip-content flag.
