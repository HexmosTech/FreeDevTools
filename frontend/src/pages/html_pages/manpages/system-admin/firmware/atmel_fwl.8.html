</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       atmel_fwl - Load firmware into Atmel at76c50x wireless networking chips.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>atmel_fwl</b> <u>&lt;interface&gt;</u> <u>/path/to/firmware</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>atmel_fwl</b> loads firmware images for Atmel at76c50x series wireless networking chips into the Linux driver
       for same.

       Note  that  this  utility is not normally necessary, since the driver will automatically load the correct
       firmware image via the hotplug system. Atmel_fwl is provided for applications where use  of  the  hotplug
       system may not be desirable.

       atmel_fwl should be run after the interface has been created (after card insertion, in the case of PCMCIA
       cards) but before it is brought up by running ifconfig.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Note  that  there are two versions of many of the firmware images, the second one with the suffix "-wpa".
       These are later releases from Atmel which support WPA privacy. They are only usable by  versions  of  the
       driver  greater  than 0.9. Be sure not to use the "-wpa" one unless your in-kernel driver code is version
       0.9 or better. Sadly, as of version 0.9, the in-kernel driver does not actually support  the  setting  of
       WPA passphrases.

       The firmware images are usually installed in /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware.

       The status of the driver, including its firmware loading, is available in /proc/driver/atmel
