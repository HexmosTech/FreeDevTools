       fsck.exfat - check an exFAT filesystem

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fsck.exfat</b> [ <b>-a</b> ] [ <b>-n</b> ] [ <b>-r</b> ] [ <b>-v</b> ] [ <b>-y</b> ] [ <b>-b</b> ] [ <b>-v</b> ] <u>device</u>
       <b>fsck.exfat</b> <b>-V</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fsck.exfat</b>  checks  an  exFAT  filesystem and repairs the filesystem depending on the options passed. The
       following corruptions can be repaired, and see the option, '-s'.

       -      Boot sector has invalid parameters. If backup boot sector is valid, replace the boot  sector  with
              it.

       -      Cluster  is  marked  as  free but belonged to a file, or vise versa. The bitmap for the cluster is
              marked properly.

       -      File size is abnormally large considering the count of clusters. The size is changed.

       -      File size is abnormally small considering the  count  of  clusters.  The  remaining  clusters  are
              deleted.

       -      File's  cluster  chain  has an invalid cluster number. The number are changed to EOF, and the file
              size is also changed.

       -      File's cluster chain contains a loop. The loop is broken.

       -      Files share the same cluster.  Cluster chains for files except one are broken.

       -      Start cluster number is invalid. The cluster number and file size are changed to 0.

       -      Checksum value of directory entry set is invalid. Directory entry set is deleted.

       -      Bad hash value of a file name. The hash value is changed properly.

       -      Fields of directory entry set have invalid values. Directory entry set is deleted.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>     This  option  does  the same thing as the -p option.  It is provided for  backwards  compatibility
              only;  it  is  suggested  that people use -p option whenever possible.

       <b>-n</b>     Check the filesystem but do not attempt to repair the filesystem.

       <b>-p</b>     Repair the filesystem without user interaction if it can be done safely.

       <b>-r</b>     Repair the filesystem interactively.

       <b>-s</b>     Create  files  in  /LOST+FOUND  for  orphan  clusters. These files have clusters allocated but not
              belonged to any files when reparing the filesystem. clusters unused and contiguous in  bitmap  are
              allocated to the same file.

       <b>-v</b>     Prints verbose debugging information while checking the exFAT filesystem.

       <b>-V</b>     Prints the version number and exits.

       <b>-y</b>     Repair the filesystem answering yes to all questions.

       <b>-b</b>     Try to repair the filesystem even if the exFAT filesystem is not found.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       repair a corrupted device and create files in /LOST+FOUND, which have clusters allocated but not belonged
       to any files when reparing the device.
       $ <b>fsck.exfat</b> <b>-p</b> <b>-s</b> <b>/dev/sda1</b>
