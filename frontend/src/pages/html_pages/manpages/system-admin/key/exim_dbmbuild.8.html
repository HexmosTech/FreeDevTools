</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       exim_dbmbuild - Build a DBM file.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>exim_dbmbuild</b> [<b>-nolc</b>] [<b>-nozero</b>] [<b>-noduperr</b>] [<b>-nowarn</b>] [<u>inputfile</u> | <b>-</b>] <u>outputfile</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>exim_dbmbuild</b> program reads an input file containing keys and data in the format used by the <u>lsearch</u>
       lookup (see section 9.1).  It writes a DBM file using  the  lower-cased  alias  names  as  keys  and  the
       remainder  of the information as data.  The lower-casing can be prevented by calling the program with the
       <b>-nolc</b> option.

       A terminating zero is included as part of the key string.  This is  expected  by  the  dbm  lookup  type.
       However, if the option <b>-nozero</b> is given, <b>exim_dbmbuild</b> creates files without terminating zeroes in either
       the key strings or the data strings.  The <u>dbmnz</u> lookup type can be used with such files.

       The  program requires two arguments: the name of the input file (which can be a single hyphen to indicate
       the standard input), and the name of the output file.  It creates the output under a temporary name,  and
       then  renames it if all went well.  If the native DB interface is in use (USE_DB is set in a compile-time
       configuration file – this is common in free versions of Unix) the  two  file  names  must  be  different,
       because  in this mode the Berkeley DB functions create a single output file using exactly the name given.
       For example,

         exim_dbmbuild /etc/aliases /etc/aliases.db

       reads the system alias file and creates a DBM version of it in /etc/aliases.db.

       In systems that use the <u>ndbm</u> routines (mostly proprietary versions of Unix), two files are used, with the
       suffixes .dir and .pag.  In  this  environment,  the  suffixes  are  added  to  the  second  argument  of
       <b>exim_dbmbuild</b>, so it can be the same as the first.  This is also the case when the Berkeley functions are
       used in compatibility mode (though this is not recommended), because in that case it adds a .db suffix to
       the file name.

       If  a  duplicate key is encountered, the program outputs a warning, and when it finishes, its return code
       is 1 rather than zero, unless the <b>-noduperr</b> option is used.  By default, only  the  first  of  a  set  of
       duplicates  is  used  – this makes it compatible with lsearch lookups.  There is an option <b>-lastdup</b> which
       causes it to use the data for the last duplicate instead.  There is also an option <b>-nowarn</b>,  which  stops
       it  listing duplicate keys to “stderr”.  For other errors, where it doesn't actually make a new file, the
       return code is 2.

       This manual page needs a major re-work.  If somebody knows better groff than us and has  more  experience
       in writing manual pages, any patches would be greatly appreciated.
