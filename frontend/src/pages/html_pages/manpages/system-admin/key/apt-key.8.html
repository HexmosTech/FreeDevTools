</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       apt-key - Deprecated APT key management utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>apt-key</b> [<b>--keyring</b> <u>filename</u>] {add <u>filename</u> | del <u>keyid</u> | export <u>keyid</u> | exportall | list | finger | adv |
               update | net-update | {-v | --version} | {-h | --help}}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apt-key</b> is used to manage the list of keys used by apt to authenticate packages. Packages which have been
       authenticated using these keys will be considered trusted.

       Use of <b>apt-key</b> is deprecated, except for the use of <b>apt-key</b> <b>del</b> in maintainer scripts to remove existing
       keys from the main keyring. If such usage of <b>apt-key</b> is desired the additional installation of the GNU
       Privacy Guard suite (packaged in gnupg) is required.

       <a href="../man8/apt-key.8.html">apt-key</a>(8) will last be available in Debian 11 and Ubuntu 22.04.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>KEYRING</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       apt-key supports only the binary OpenPGP format (also known as "GPG key public ring") in files with the
       "gpg" extension, not the keybox database format introduced in newer <b><a href="../man1/gpg.1.html">gpg</a></b>(1) versions as default for
       keyring files. Binary keyring files intended to be used with any apt version should therefore always be
       created with <b>gpg</b> <b>--export</b>.

       Alternatively, if all systems which should be using the created keyring have at least apt version &gt;= 1.4
       installed, you can use the ASCII armored format with the "asc" extension instead which can be created
       with <b>gpg</b> <b>--armor</b> <b>--export</b>.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>add</b> <u>filename</u> (deprecated)
           Add a new key to the list of trusted keys. The key is read from the filename given with the parameter
           <u>filename</u> or if the filename is - from standard input.

           It is critical that keys added manually via <b>apt-key</b> are verified to belong to the owner of the
           repositories they claim to be for otherwise the <b><a href="../man8/apt-secure.8.html">apt-secure</a></b>(8) infrastructure is completely
           undermined.

           <u>Note</u>: Instead of using this command a keyring should be placed directly in the
           <a href="file:/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/">/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/</a> directory with a descriptive name and either "gpg" or "asc" as file
           extension.

       <b>del</b> <u>keyid</u> (mostly deprecated)
           Remove a key from the list of trusted keys.

       <b>export</b> <u>keyid</u> (deprecated)
           Output the key <u>keyid</u> to standard output.

       <b>exportall</b> (deprecated)
           Output all trusted keys to standard output.

       <b>list</b>, <b>finger</b> (deprecated)
           List trusted keys with fingerprints.

       <b>adv</b> (deprecated)
           Pass advanced options to gpg. With <b>adv</b> <b>--recv-key</b> you can e.g. download key from keyservers directly
           into the trusted set of keys. Note that there are <u>no</u> checks performed, so it is easy to completely
           undermine the <b><a href="../man8/apt-secure.8.html">apt-secure</a></b>(8) infrastructure if used without care.

       <b>update</b> (deprecated)
           Update the local keyring with the archive keyring and remove from the local keyring the archive keys
           which are no longer valid. The archive keyring is shipped in the archive-keyring package of your
           distribution, e.g. the ubuntu-keyring package in Ubuntu.

           Note that a distribution does not need to and in fact should not use this command any longer and
           instead ship keyring files in the <a href="file:/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/">/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/</a> directory directly as this avoids a
           dependency on gnupg and it is easier to manage keys by simply adding and removing files for
           maintainers and users alike.

       <b>net-update</b> (deprecated)
           Perform an update working similarly to the <b>update</b> command above, but get the archive keyring from a
           URI instead and validate it against a master key. This requires an installed <b><a href="../man1/wget.1.html">wget</a></b>(1) and an APT build
           configured to have a server to fetch from and a master keyring to validate. APT in Debian does not
           support this command, relying on <b>update</b> instead, but Ubuntu's APT does.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that options need to be defined before the commands described in the previous section.

       <b>--keyring</b> <u>filename</u> (deprecated)
           With this option it is possible to specify a particular keyring file the command should operate on.
           The default is that a command is executed on the trusted.gpg file as well as on all parts in the
           trusted.gpg.d directory, though trusted.gpg is the primary keyring which means that e.g. new keys are
           added to this one.

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATION</b></h4><pre>
       Except for using <b>apt-key</b> <b>del</b> in maintainer scripts, the use of <b>apt-key</b> is deprecated. This section shows
       how to replace existing use of <b>apt-key</b>.

       If your existing use of <b>apt-key</b> <b>add</b> looks like this:

       wget -qO- https://myrepo.example/myrepo.asc | sudo apt-key add -

       Then you can directly replace this with (though note the recommendation below):

       wget -qO- https://myrepo.example/myrepo.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/myrepo.asc

       Make sure to use the "asc" extension for ASCII armored keys and the "gpg" extension for the binary
       OpenPGP format (also known as "GPG key public ring"). The binary OpenPGP format works for all apt
       versions, while the ASCII armored format works for apt version &gt;= 1.4.

       <u>Recommended:</u> Instead of placing keys into the <a href="file:/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d">/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d</a> directory, you can place them
       anywhere on your filesystem by using the Signed-By option in your sources.list and pointing to the
       filename of the key. See <b><a href="../man5/sources.list.5.html">sources.list</a></b>(5) for details. Since APT 2.4, <a href="file:/etc/apt/keyrings">/etc/apt/keyrings</a> is provided as the
       recommended location for keys not managed by packages. When using a deb822-style sources.list, and with
       apt version &gt;= 2.4, the Signed-By option can also be used to include the full ASCII armored keyring
       directly in the sources.list without an additional file.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/apt/trusted.gpg
           Keyring of local trusted keys, new keys will be added here. Configuration Item: Dir::Etc::Trusted.

       <a href="file:/etc/apt/keyrings/">/etc/apt/keyrings/</a>
