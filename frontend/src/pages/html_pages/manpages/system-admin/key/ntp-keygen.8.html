       ntp-keygen — Create a NTP host key

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ntp-keygen</b> [<b>-flags</b>] [<b>-flag</b> [<u>value</u>]] [<b>--option-name</b>[[=| ]<u>value</u>]]

                  All arguments must be options.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  generates  cryptographic  data  files  used by the NTPv4 authentication and identification
       schemes.  It can generate message digest keys used in symmetric key  cryptography  and,  if  the  OpenSSL
       software  library has been installed, it can generate host keys, signing keys, certificates, and identity
       keys and parameters used in Autokey public key cryptography.  These files are used for cookie encryption,
       digital signature, and challenge/response identification algorithms compatible with the Internet standard
       security infrastructure.

       The message digest symmetric keys file is generated in a format compatible with NTPv3.  All  other  files
       are  in PEM-encoded printable ASCII format, so they can be embedded as MIME attachments in email to other
       sites and certificate authorities.  By default, files are not encrypted.

       When used to generate message  digest  symmetric  keys,  the  program  produces  a  file  containing  ten
       pseudo-random  printable  ASCII  strings  suitable  for  the MD5 message digest algorithm included in the
       distribution.  If the OpenSSL library is installed, it produces an additional ten hex-encoded random  bit
       strings  suitable  for  SHA1,  AES-128-CMAC,  and  other  message  digest algorithms.  The message digest
       symmetric keys file must be distributed and stored using secure means beyond the  scope  of  NTP  itself.
       Besides  the keys used for ordinary NTP associations, additional keys can be defined as passwords for the
       <u><a href="../man1/ntpq.1.html">ntpq</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/ntpdc.1.html">ntpdc</a></u>(1) utility programs.

       The remaining generated files are compatible  with  other  OpenSSL  applications  and  other  Public  Key
       Infrastructure  (PKI)  resources.   Certificates  generated  by  this  program are compatible with extant
       industry practice, although some users might find the interpretation of X509v3 extension fields  somewhat
       liberal.  However, the identity keys are probably not compatible with anything other than Autokey.

       Some files used by this program are encrypted using a private password.  The <b>-p</b> option specifies the read
       password  for  local  encrypted  files  and  the <b>-q</b> option the write password for encrypted files sent to
       remote sites.  If no password is specified, the host name  returned  by  the  Unix  <u><a href="../man1/hostname.1.html">hostname</a></u>(1)  command,
       normally  the  DNS  name  of  the  host,  is used as the the default read password, for convenience.  The
       <b>ntp-keygen</b> program prompts for the password if it reads an encrypted file and the password is missing  or
       incorrect.   If  an  encrypted  file  is  read  successfully and no write password is specified, the read
       password is used as the write password by default.

       The <b>pw</b> option of the <b>crypto</b> <u><a href="../man8/ntpd.8.html">ntpd</a></u>(8) configuration command specifies  the  read  password  for  previously
       encrypted  local files.  This must match the local read password used by this program.  If not specified,
       the host name is used.  Thus, if files are generated by this program without an explicit  password,  they
       can  be  read  back by <u><a href="../man8/ntpd.8.html">ntpd</a></u>(8) without specifying an explicit password but only on the same host.  If the
       write password used for encryption is specified as the host name, these files can be read  by  that  host
       with no explicit password.

       Normally,  encrypted  files for each host are generated by that host and used only by that host, although
       exceptions exist as noted later on this page.  The symmetric keys  file,  normally  called  <u>ntp.keys</u>,  is
       usually  installed  in  <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u>.   Other  files  and links are usually installed in <u><a href="file:/usr/local/etc">/usr/local/etc</a></u>, which is
       normally in a shared filesystem in NFS-mounted networks and cannot be  changed  by  shared  clients.   In
       these  cases,  NFS  clients  can  specify  the  files in another directory such as <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> using the <b>keysdir</b>
       <u><a href="../man8/ntpd.8.html">ntpd</a></u>(8) configuration file command.

       This program directs commentary and error messages to the standard error stream <u>stderr</u> and  remote  files
       to  the  standard  output  stream  <u>stdout</u>  where they can be piped to other applications or redirected to
       files.  The names used for generated files and links all begin with the string <u>ntpkey*</u>  and  include  the
       file type, generating host and filestamp, as described in the “Cryptographic Data Files” section below.

   <b>Running</b> <b>the</b> <b>Program</b>
       The safest way to run the <b>ntp-keygen</b> program is logged in directly as root.  The recommended procedure is
       change to the <u>keys</u> directory, usually <u><a href="file:/usr/local/etc">/usr/local/etc</a></u>, then run the program.

       To  test  and  gain  experience  with  Autokey concepts, log in as root and change to the <u>keys</u> directory,
       usually <u><a href="file:/usr/local/etc">/usr/local/etc</a></u>.  When run for the first time, or if all files with names beginning  with  <u>ntpkey*</u>
       have  been  removed,  use the <b>ntp-keygen</b> command without arguments to generate a default <b>RSA</b> host key and
       matching <b>RSA-MD5</b> certificate file with expiration date one year hence, which is all that is necessary  in
       many  cases.   The  program also generates soft links from the generic names to the respective files.  If
       run again without options, the program uses  the  existing  keys  and  parameters  and  generates  a  new
       certificate file with new expiration date one year hence, and soft link.

       The  host  key is used to encrypt the cookie when required and so must be <b>RSA</b> type.  By default, the host
       key is also the sign key used to encrypt signatures.   When  necessary,  a  different  sign  key  can  be
       specified  and  this  can be either <b>RSA</b> or <b>DSA</b> type.  By default, the message digest type is <b>MD5</b>, but any
       combination of sign key type and message digest type supported by the OpenSSL library can  be  specified,
       including  those  using  the <b>AES128CMAC</b>, <b>MD2</b>, <b>MD5</b>, <b>MDC2</b>, <b>SHA</b>, <b>SHA1</b> and <b>RIPE160</b> message digest algorithms.
       However, the scheme specified in the certificate must be compatible  with  the  sign  key.   Certificates
       using any digest algorithm are compatible with <b>RSA</b> sign keys; however, only <b>SHA</b> and <b>SHA1</b> certificates are
       compatible with <b>DSA</b> sign keys.

       Private/public  key files and certificates are compatible with other OpenSSL applications and very likely
       other libraries as well.  Certificates or certificate requests derived from  them  should  be  compatible
       with  extant  industry  practice,  although  some users might find the interpretation of X509v3 extension
       fields somewhat liberal.  However, the identification parameter files,  although  encoded  as  the  other
       files, are probably not compatible with anything other than Autokey.

       Running  the  program  as  other  than  root and using the Unix <u><a href="../man1/su.1.html">su</a></u>(1) command to assume root may not work
       properly, since by default the OpenSSL library looks for the random seed  file  <u>.rnd</u>  in  the  user  home
       directory.   However,  there  should  be only one <u>.rnd</u>, most conveniently in the root directory, so it is
       convenient to define the RANDFILE environment variable used by the OpenSSL library as the path to <u>.rnd</u>.

       Installing the keys as root might not work in NFS-mounted shared file systems, as NFS clients may not  be
       able  to  write  to  the  shared keys directory, even as root.  In this case, NFS clients can specify the
       files in another directory such as <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> using the <b>keysdir</b> <u><a href="../man8/ntpd.8.html">ntpd</a></u>(8) configuration file command.   There  is
       no  need  for one client to read the keys and certificates of other clients or servers, as these data are
       obtained automatically by the Autokey protocol.

       Ordinarily, cryptographic files are generated by the host that uses  them,  but  it  is  possible  for  a
       trusted agent (TA) to generate these files for other hosts; however, in such cases files should always be
       encrypted.   The  subject name and trusted name default to the hostname of the host generating the files,
       but can be changed by command line options.  It is convenient to designate the  owner  name  and  trusted
       name as the subject and issuer fields, respectively, of the certificate.  The owner name is also used for
       the host and sign key files, while the trusted name is used for the identity files.

       All  files  are  installed by default in the keys directory <u><a href="file:/usr/local/etc">/usr/local/etc</a></u>, which is normally in a shared
       filesystem in NFS-mounted networks.  The actual location of the keys  directory  and  each  file  can  be
       overridden by configuration commands, but this is not recommended.  Normally, the files for each host are
       generated by that host and used only by that host, although exceptions exist as noted later on this page.

       Normally,  files  containing  private  values,  including  the  host  key,  sign  key  and identification
       parameters, are permitted root read/write-only; while others containing public values are permitted world
       readable.  Alternatively, files containing private values can be  encrypted  and  these  files  permitted
       world  readable, which simplifies maintenance in shared file systems.  Since uniqueness is insured by the
       <u>hostname</u> and <u>filestamp</u> file name extensions, the files for an NTP server and dependent clients can all be
       installed in the same shared directory.

       The recommended practice is to keep the file name extensions when installing a file and to install a soft
       link from the generic names specified elsewhere on this page to the generated  files.   This  allows  new
       file  generations  to be activated simply by changing the link.  If a link is present, <u><a href="../man8/ntpd.8.html">ntpd</a></u>(8) follows it
       to the file name to extract the <u>filestamp</u>.  If a link is not present, <u><a href="../man8/ntpd.8.html">ntpd</a></u>(8) extracts the <u>filestamp</u> from
       the file itself.  This allows clients to verify that the file and generation times  are  always  current.
       The  <b>ntp-keygen</b>  program  uses  the same <u>filestamp</u> extension for all files generated at one time, so each
       generation is distinct and can be readily recognized in monitoring data.

       Run the command on as many hosts as necessary.  Designate one of them as  the  trusted  host  (TH)  using
       <b>ntp-keygen</b>  with  the  <b>-T</b>  option  and  configure it to synchronize from reliable Internet servers.  Then
       configure the other hosts to synchronize to the TH  directly  or  indirectly.   A  certificate  trail  is
       created when Autokey asks the immediately ascendant host towards the TH to sign its certificate, which is
       then  provided  to  the  immediately  descendant  host  on  request.  All group hosts should have acyclic
       certificate trails ending on the TH.

       The host key is used to encrypt the cookie when required and so must be RSA type.  By default,  the  host
       key  is  also the sign key used to encrypt signatures.  A different sign key can be assigned using the <b>-S</b>
       option and this can be either <b>RSA</b> or <b>DSA</b> type.  By default, the signature message digest type is <b>MD5</b>, but
       any combination of sign key type and message  digest  type  supported  by  the  OpenSSL  library  can  be
       specified using the <b>-c</b> option.

       The  rules  say  cryptographic  media should be generated with proventic filestamps, which means the host
       should already be synchronized before this program is run.  This  of  course  creates  a  chicken-and-egg
       problem  when  the  host is started for the first time.  Accordingly, the host time should be set by some
       other means, such as eyeball-and-wristwatch, at least so that the  certificate  lifetime  is  within  the
       current year.  After that and when the host is synchronized to a proventic source, the certificate should
       be re-generated.

       Additional   information   on  trusted  groups  and  identity  schemes  is  on  the  “Autokey  Public-Key
       Authentication” page.

       File names begin with the prefix <u>ntpkey</u>_ and end with the suffix <b>_</b><u>hostname</u>. <u>filestamp</u>, where <u>hostname</u>  is
       the  owner  name,  usually  the string returned by the Unix <u><a href="../man1/hostname.1.html">hostname</a></u>(1) command, and <u>filestamp</u> is the NTP
       seconds when the file was generated, in decimal digits.  This both guarantees uniqueness  and  simplifies
       maintenance  procedures,  since  all  files  can  be quickly removed by a <b>rm</b> <u>ntpkey*</u> command or all files
       generated at a specific time can be removed by a <b>rm</b> <u>*filestamp</u> command.  To further reduce  the  risk  of
       misconfiguration,  the  first  two  lines of a file contain the file name and generation date and time as
       comments.

   <b>Trusted</b> <b>Hosts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Groups</b>
       Each cryptographic configuration involves selection of a  signature  scheme  and  identification  scheme,
       called  a  cryptotype,  as explained in the “Authentication Options” section of <u><a href="../man5/ntp.conf.5.html">ntp.conf</a></u>(5).  The default
       cryptotype uses <b>RSA</b> encryption, <b>MD5</b> message digest and <b>TC</b> identification.  First, configure a NTP  subnet
       including  one  or  more  low-stratum  trusted  hosts  from  which all other hosts derive synchronization
       directly or indirectly.  Trusted hosts  have  trusted  certificates;  all  other  hosts  have  nontrusted
       certificates.   These  hosts will automatically and dynamically build authoritative certificate trails to
       one or more trusted hosts.  A trusted group is the set of all hosts that have, directly or indirectly,  a
       certificate trail ending at a trusted host.  The trail is defined by static configuration file entries or
       dynamic means described on the “Automatic NTP Configuration Options” section of <u><a href="../man5/ntp.conf.5.html">ntp.conf</a></u>(5).

       On each trusted host as root, change to the keys directory.  To insure a fresh fileset, remove all <u>ntpkey</u>
       files.   Then  run  <b>ntp-keygen</b>  <b>-T</b> to generate keys and a trusted certificate.  On all other hosts do the
       same, but leave off the <b>-T</b> flag to generate keys and nontrusted certificates.  When complete,  start  the
       NTP  daemons  beginning at the lowest stratum and working up the tree.  It may take some time for Autokey
       to instantiate the certificate trails throughout the subnet, but setting up the environment is completely
       automatic.

       If it is necessary to use a different sign key or different digest/signature scheme than the default, run
       <b>ntp-keygen</b> with the <b>-S</b> <u>type</u> option, where <u>type</u> is either <b>RSA</b> or <b>DSA</b>.  The most frequent need to  do  this
       is  when a <b>DSA</b>-signed certificate is used.  If it is necessary to use a different certificate scheme than
       the default, run <b>ntp-keygen</b> with the <b>-c</b> <u>scheme</u> option and selected <u>scheme</u> as needed.   If  <b>ntp-keygen</b>  is
       run  again  without these options, it generates a new certificate using the same scheme and sign key, and
       soft link.

       After setting up the environment it is advisable to update certificates from time to  time,  if  only  to
       extend  the  validity  interval.   Simply  run  <b>ntp-keygen</b>  with the same flags as before to generate new
       certificates using existing keys, and soft links.  However, if the host or sign key is  changed,  <u><a href="../man8/ntpd.8.html">ntpd</a></u>(8)
       should be restarted.  When <u><a href="../man8/ntpd.8.html">ntpd</a></u>(8) is restarted, it loads any new files and restarts the protocol.  Other
       dependent  hosts  will  continue  as  usual until signatures are refreshed, at which time the protocol is
       restarted.

   <b>Identity</b> <b>Schemes</b>
       As mentioned on the Autonomous Authentication page, the default <b>TC</b> identity scheme  is  vulnerable  to  a
       middleman  attack.   However, there are more secure identity schemes available, including <b>PC</b>, <b>IFF</b>, <b>GQ</b> and
       <b>MV</b> schemes described below.  These schemes are based on a TA, one or more trusted hosts and  some  number
       of  nontrusted  hosts.  Trusted hosts prove identity using values provided by the TA, while the remaining
       hosts prove identity using values provided by a trusted host and certificate  trails  that  end  on  that
       host.  The name of a trusted host is also the name of its sugroup and also the subject and issuer name on
       its trusted certificate.  The TA is not necessarily a trusted host in this sense, but often is.

       In  some  schemes  there  are  separate  keys  for servers and clients.  A server can also be a client of
       another server, but a client can never be a server for another client.  In  general,  trusted  hosts  and
       nontrusted hosts that operate as both server and client have parameter files that contain both server and
       client keys.  Hosts that operate only as clients have key files that contain only client keys.

       The  PC  scheme  supports only one trusted host in the group.  On trusted host alice run <b>ntp-keygen</b> <b>-P</b> <b>-p</b>
       <u>password</u> to generate the host key file <u>ntpkey</u>_ <b>RSA</b> <u>key_alice.</u> <u>filestamp</u> and trusted  private  certificate
       file  <u>ntpkey</u>_  <b>RSA-MD5</b> <b>_</b> <u>cert_alice.</u> <u>filestamp</u>, and soft links.  Copy both files to all group hosts; they
       replace the files which would be generated in other schemes.  On each host <u>bob</u> install a soft  link  from
       the  generic  name  <u>ntpkey_host_bob</u>  to  the  host  key file and soft link <u>ntpkey_cert_bob</u> to the private
       certificate file.  Note the generic links are on bob, but point to files generated by trusted host alice.
       In this scheme it is not possible to refresh either the keys or certificates without copying them to  all
       other hosts in the group, and recreating the soft links.

       For  the  <b>IFF</b>  scheme  proceed as in the <b>TC</b> scheme to generate keys and certificates for all group hosts,
       then for every trusted host in the group, generate the <b>IFF</b> parameter file.  On  trusted  host  alice  run
       <b>ntp-keygen</b>  <b>-T</b> <b>-I</b> <b>-p</b> <u>password</u> to produce her parameter file <u>ntpkey_IFFpar_alice.filestamp</u>, which includes
       both server and client keys.  Copy this file to all group hosts that operate as both servers and  clients
       and install a soft link from the generic <u>ntpkey_iff_alice</u> to this file.  If there are no hosts restricted
       to operate only as clients, there is nothing further to do.  As the <b>IFF</b> scheme is independent of keys and
       certificates, these files can be refreshed as needed.

       If  a  rogue  client  has  the  parameter  file, it could masquerade as a legitimate server and present a
       middleman threat.  To eliminate this threat, the client keys can be extracted from the parameter file and
       distributed to all restricted clients.  After generating the parameter file, on alice run  <b>ntp-keygen</b>  <b>-e</b>
       and  pipe  the output to a file or email program.  Copy or email this file to all restricted clients.  On
       these clients install a soft link from the generic <u>ntpkey_iff_alice</u> to this file.  To further protect the
       integrity of the keys, each file can be encrypted with a secret password.

       For the <b>GQ</b> scheme proceed as in the <b>TC</b> scheme to generate keys and certificates for all group hosts, then
       for every trusted host in the group, generate  the  <b>IFF</b>  parameter  file.   On  trusted  host  alice  run
       <b>ntp-keygen</b>  <b>-T</b>  <b>-G</b> <b>-p</b> <u>password</u> to produce her parameter file <u>ntpkey_GQpar_alice.filestamp</u>, which includes
       both server and client keys.  Copy this file to all group hosts and install a soft link from the  generic
       <u>ntpkey_gq_alice</u>  to  this  file.   In  addition,  on  each  host  <u>bob</u>  install  a  soft link from generic
       <u>ntpkey_gq_bob</u> to this file.  As the <b>GQ</b> scheme updates the <b>GQ</b> parameters file and certificate at the  same
       time, keys and certificates can be regenerated as needed.

       For  the  <b>MV</b>  scheme,  proceed as in the <b>TC</b> scheme to generate keys and certificates for all group hosts.
       For illustration assume trish is the TA, alice one of several trusted hosts and bob one of  her  clients.
       On  TA  trish  run  <b>ntp-keygen</b> <b>-V</b> <u>n</u> <b>-p</b> <u>password</u>, where <u>n</u> is the number of revokable keys (typically 5) to
       produce the parameter file <u>ntpkeys_MVpar_trish.filestamp</u> and client key  files  <u>ntpkeys_MVkeyd</u>  <b>_</b>  <u>trish.</u>
       <u>filestamp</u>  where  <u>d</u>  is  the key number (0 &lt; <u>d</u> &lt; <u>n</u>).  Copy the parameter file to alice and install a soft
       link from the generic <u>ntpkey_mv_alice</u> to this file.  Copy one of the client key files to alice for  later
       distribution to her clients.  It does not matter which client key file goes to alice, since they all work
       the same way.  Alice copies the client key file to all of her clients.  On client bob install a soft link
       from  generic  <u>ntpkey_mvkey_bob</u>  to  the  client  key  file.  As the <b>MV</b> scheme is independent of keys and
       certificates, these files can be refreshed as needed.

   <b>Command</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-b</b> <b>--imbits</b>= <u>modulus</u>
               Set the number of bits in the identity modulus for generating identity keys to <u>modulus</u> bits.  The
               number of bits in the identity modulus defaults to 256, but can be set to values from 256 to 2048
               (32 to 256 octets).  Use the larger  moduli  with  caution,  as  this  can  consume  considerable
               computing resources and increases the size of authenticated packets.

       <b>-c</b> <b>--certificate</b>= <u>scheme</u>
               Select  certificate  signature  encryption/message  digest  scheme.  The <u>scheme</u> can be one of the
               following: <b>RSA-MD2</b>, <b>RSA-MD5</b>, <b>RSA-MDC2</b>, <b>RSA-SHA</b>, <b>RSA-SHA1</b>, <b>RSA-RIPEMD160</b>,  <b>DSA-SHA</b>,  or  <b>DSA-SHA1</b>.
               Note  that  <b>RSA</b> schemes must be used with an <b>RSA</b> sign key and <b>DSA</b> schemes must be used with a <b>DSA</b>
               sign key.  The default without this option is <b>RSA-MD5</b>.   If  compatibility  with  FIPS  140-2  is
               required, either the <b>DSA-SHA</b> or <b>DSA-SHA1</b> scheme must be used.

       <b>-C</b> <b>--cipher</b>= <u>cipher</u>
               Select the OpenSSL cipher to encrypt the files containing private keys.  The default without this
               option  is  three-key triple DES in CBC mode, <b>des-ede3-cbc</b>.  The <b>openssl</b> <b>-h</b> command provided with
               OpenSSL displays available ciphers.

       <b>-d</b> <b>--debug-level</b>
               Increase debugging verbosity level.  This option displays  the  cryptographic  data  produced  in
               eye-friendly billboards.

       <b>-D</b> <b>--set-debug-level</b>= <u>level</u>
               Set  the  debugging  verbosity to <u>level</u>.  This option displays the cryptographic data produced in
               eye-friendly billboards.

       <b>-e</b> <b>--id-key</b>
               Write the <b>IFF</b> or <b>GQ</b> public parameters from the  <u>IFFkey</u>  <u>or</u>  <u>GQkey</u>  client  keys  file  previously
               specified  as  unencrypted  data  to  the  standard  output  stream <u>stdout</u>.  This is intended for
               automatic key distribution by email.

       <b>-G</b> <b>--gq-params</b>
               Generate a new encrypted <b>GQ</b> parameters and key file  for  the  Guillou-Quisquater  (GQ)  identity
               scheme.  This option is mutually exclusive with the <b>-I</b> and <b>-V</b> options.

       <b>-H</b> <b>--host-key</b>
               Generate a new encrypted <b>RSA</b> public/private host key file.

       <b>-I</b> <b>--iffkey</b>
               Generate  a  new  encrypted  <b>IFF</b>  key file for the Schnorr (IFF) identity scheme.  This option is
               mutually exclusive with the <b>-G</b> and Fl V options.

       <b>-i</b> <b>--ident</b>= <u>group</u>
               Set the optional Autokey group name to <u>group</u>.  This is used in the identity scheme parameter file
               names of <b>IFF</b>, <b>GQ</b>, and <b>MV</b> client parameters files.  In that role, the default is the host name  if
               no group is provided.  The group name, if specified using <b>-i</b> or <b>-s</b> following an ‘@’ character, is
               also  used  in certificate subject and issuer names in the form <u>host</u> <u>@</u> <u>group</u> and should match the
               group specified via <b>crypto</b> <b>ident</b> or <b>server</b> <b>ident</b> in the ntpd configuration file.

       <b>-l</b> <b>--lifetime</b>= <u>days</u>
               Set the lifetime for certificate expiration to <u>days</u>.  The  default  lifetime  is  one  year  (365
               days).

       <b>-m</b> <b>--modulus</b>= <u>bits</u>
               Set  the  number of bits in the prime modulus for generating files to <u>bits</u>.  The modulus defaults
               to 512, but can be set from 256 to 2048 (32 to 256 octets).  Use the larger moduli with  caution,
               as  this  can  consume  considerable  computing resources and increases the size of authenticated
               packets.

       <b>-M</b> <b>--md5key</b>
               Generate a new symmetric keys file containing 10 <b>MD5</b> keys, and if OpenSSL is  available,  10  <b>SHA</b>
               keys.   An  <b>MD5</b>  key  is  a  string of 20 random printable ASCII characters, while a <b>SHA</b> key is a
               string of 40 random hex digits.  The file can be edited using a text editor  to  change  the  key
               type or key content.  This option is mutually exclusive with all other options.

       <b>-p</b> <b>--password</b>= <u>passwd</u>
               Set the password for reading and writing encrypted files to <u>passwd</u>.  These include the host, sign
               and  identify  key  files.   By default, the password is the string returned by the Unix <b>hostname</b>
               command.

       <b>-P</b> <b>--pvt-cert</b>
               Generate a new private certificate used by the <b>PC</b>  identity  scheme.   By  default,  the  program
               generates  public  certificates.   Note:  the  PC  identity  scheme  is  not  recommended for new
               installations.

       <b>-q</b> <b>--export-passwd</b>= <u>passwd</u>
               Set the password for writing encrypted <b>IFF</b>, <b>GQ</b> <b>and</b> <b>MV</b> identity  files  redirected  to  <u>stdout</u>  to
               <u>passwd</u>.   In  effect,  these files are decrypted with the <b>-p</b> password, then encrypted with the <b>-q</b>
               password.  By default, the password is the string returned by the Unix <b>hostname</b> command.

       <b>-s</b> <b>--subject-key</b>= <u>file</u> <u>...</u> [host] [@ <u>group</u>]
               Specify the Autokey host name, where <u>host</u> is the optional host name and  <u>group</u>  is  the  optional
               group  name.   The  host  name,  and  if  provided,  group  name are used in <u>host</u> <u>@</u> <u>group</u> form as
               certificate subject and issuer.  Specifying <b>-s</b> <b>-@</b> <u>group</u> is allowed, and results  in  leaving  the
               host name unchanged, as with <b>-i</b> <u>group</u>.  The group name, or if no group is provided, the host name
               are  also  used  in the file names of <b>IFF</b>, <b>GQ</b>, and <b>MV</b> identity scheme client parameter files.  If
               <u>host</u> is not specified, the default host name is the string returned by the Unix <b>hostname</b> command.

       <b>-S</b> <b>--sign-key</b>= [<b>RSA</b> | <b>DSA</b>]
               Generate a new encrypted public/private sign key file of the specified  type.   By  default,  the
               sign  key  is  the host key and has the same type.  If compatibility with FIPS 140-2 is required,
               the sign key type must be <b>DSA</b>.

       <b>-T</b> <b>--trusted-cert</b>
               Generate a trusted certificate.  By default, the program generates a non-trusted certificate.

       <b>-V</b> <b>--mv-params</b> <u>nkeys</u>
               Generate <u>nkeys</u> encrypted server keys and parameters for the Mu-Varadharajan (MV) identity scheme.
               This option is mutually exclusive with the <b>-I</b> and <b>-G</b> options.   Note:  support  for  this  option
               should be considered a work in progress.

   <b>Random</b> <b>Seed</b> <b>File</b>
       All  cryptographically sound key generation schemes must have means to randomize the entropy seed used to
       initialize the internal pseudo-random number generator used by the library routines.  The OpenSSL library
       uses a designated random seed file for this purpose.  The file must be available when  starting  the  NTP
       daemon  and  <b>ntp-keygen</b>  program.  If a site supports OpenSSL or its companion OpenSSH, it is very likely
       that means to do this are already available.

       It is important to understand that entropy must be evolved for each generation, for otherwise the  random
       number  sequence  would  be  predictable.   Various means dependent on external events, such as keystroke
       intervals, can be used to do this and some systems have built-in entropy  sources.   Suitable  means  are
       described in the OpenSSL software documentation, but are outside the scope of this page.

       The  entropy  seed used by the OpenSSL library is contained in a file, usually called <u>.rnd</u>, which must be
       available when starting the NTP daemon or the <b>ntp-keygen</b> program.  The NTP daemon will first look for the
       file using the path specified by the <b>randfile</b> subcommand of the <b>crypto</b>  configuration  command.   If  not
       specified  in  this  way,  or when starting the <b>ntp-keygen</b> program, the OpenSSL library will look for the
       file using the path specified by the RANDFILE environment variable in the user  home  directory,  whether
       root  or some other user.  If the RANDFILE environment variable is not present, the library will look for
       the <u>.rnd</u> file in the user home directory.  Since both the <b>ntp-keygen</b> program and <u><a href="../man8/ntpd.8.html">ntpd</a></u>(8) daemon must  run
       as  root,  the logical place to put this file is in <u>/.rnd</u> or <u>/root/.rnd</u>.  If the file is not available or
       cannot be written, the daemon exits with a message to the  system  log  and  the  program  exits  with  a
       suitable error message.

   <b>Cryptographic</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Files</b>
       All file formats begin with two nonencrypted lines.  The first line contains the file name, including the
       generated  host  name  and filestamp, in the format <u>ntpkey_key</u> <b>_</b> <u>name</u>. <u>filestamp</u>, where <u>key</u> is the key or
       parameter type, <u>name</u> is the host or group name and <u>filestamp</u> is the filestamp (NTP seconds) when the file
       was created.  By convention, <u>key</u> names in  generated  file  names  include  both  upper  and  lower  case
       characters, while <u>key</u> names in generated link names include only lower case characters.  The filestamp is
       not  used  in  generated  link  names.   The second line contains the datestamp in conventional Unix <u>date</u>
       format.  Lines beginning with ‘#’ are considered comments and  ignored  by  the  <b>ntp-keygen</b>  program  and
       <u><a href="../man8/ntpd.8.html">ntpd</a></u>(8) daemon.

       The remainder of the file contains cryptographic data, encoded first using ASN.1 rules, then encrypted if
       necessary, and finally written in PEM-encoded printable ASCII text, preceded and followed by MIME content
       identifier lines.

       The  format  of  the symmetric keys file, ordinarily named <u>ntp.keys</u>, is somewhat different than the other
       files in the interest of backward compatibility.  Ordinarily, the file is generated by this program,  but
       it can be constructed and edited using an ordinary text editor.

             Figure 1. Typical Symmetric Key File

       Figure  1 shows a typical symmetric keys file used by the reference implementation.  Following the header
       the keys are entered one per line in the format
             <u>keyno</u> <u>type</u> <u>key</u>
       where <u>keyno</u> is a positive integer in the range 1-65535; <u>type</u> is the  key  type  for  the  message  digest
       algorithm,  which  in  the absence of the OpenSSL library must be <b>MD5</b> to designate the MD5 message digest
       algorithm; if the OpenSSL library is installed,  the  key  type  can  be  any  message  digest  algorithm
       supported  by  that  library; however, if compatibility with FIPS 140-2 is required, the key type must be
       either <b>SHA</b> or <b>SHA1</b>; <u>key</u> is the key itself, which is a printable ASCII string 20  characters  or  less  in
       length:  each  character  is chosen from the 93 printable characters in the range 0x21 through 0x7e ( ‘’!
       through ‘~’ ) excluding space and the ‘#’ character, and terminated by whitespace or a ‘#’ character.  An
       OpenSSL key consists of a hex-encoded ASCII string of 40 characters, which is truncated as necessary.

       Note that the keys used by the <u><a href="../man1/ntpq.1.html">ntpq</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/ntpdc.1.html">ntpdc</a></u>(1) programs are checked against passwords  requested  by
       the  programs and entered by hand, so it is generally appropriate to specify these keys in human readable
       ASCII format.

       The <b>ntp-keygen</b> program generates a symmetric keys file <u>ntpkey_MD5key_hostname</u>.<u>filestamp</u>.  Since the  file
       contains  private shared keys, it should be visible only to root and distributed by secure means to other
       subnet hosts.  The NTP daemon loads the file <u>ntp.keys</u>, so <b>ntp-keygen</b> installs a soft link from this  name
       to  the  generated file.  Subsequently, similar soft links must be installed by manual or automated means
       on the other subnet hosts.  While this file is not used with the Autokey Version 2 protocol, it is needed
       to authenticate some remote configuration commands used by the <u><a href="../man1/ntpq.1.html">ntpq</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/ntpdc.1.html">ntpdc</a></u>(1) utilities.

               identity modulus bits.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>imbits</u>
               is constrained to being:
                   in the range  256 through 2048

               The number of bits in the identity modulus.  The default is 256.

       <b>-c</b> <u>scheme</u>, <b>--certificate</b>=<u>scheme</u>
               certificate scheme.

               scheme is one of RSA-MD2, RSA-MD5, RSA-MDC2, RSA-SHA, RSA-SHA1, RSA-RIPEMD160, DSA-SHA, or
               DSA-SHA1.

               Select the certificate signature encryption/message digest scheme.  Note that RSA schemes must be
               used with a RSA sign key and DSA schemes must be used with a DSA sign key.  The default without
               this option is RSA-MD5.

       <b>-C</b> <u>cipher</u>, <b>--cipher</b>=<u>cipher</u>
               privatekey cipher.

               Select the cipher which is used to encrypt the files containing private keys.  The default is
               three-key triple DES in CBC mode, equivalent to "<b>-C</b> <b>des-ede3-cbc</b>".  The openssl tool lists
               ciphers available in "<b>openssl</b> <b>-h</b>" output.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug-level</b>
               Increase debug verbosity level.  This option may appear an unlimited number of times.

       <b>-D</b> <u>number</u>, <b>--set-debug-level</b>=<u>number</u>
               Set the debug verbosity level.  This option may appear an unlimited number of times.  This option

               set Autokey group name.

               Set the optional Autokey group name to name.  This is used in the file name of IFF, GQ, and MV
               client parameters files.  In that role, the default is the host name if this option is not
               provided.  The group name, if specified using <b>-i/--ident</b> or using <b>-s/--subject-name</b> following an
               '<b>@</b>' character, is also a part of the self-signed host certificate subject and issuer names in the
               form <b>host@group</b> and should match the ´<b>crypto</b> <b>ident</b>' or '<b>server</b> <b>ident</b>' configuration in the <b>ntpd</b>
               configuration file.

       <b>-l</b> <u>lifetime</u>, <b>--lifetime</b>=<u>lifetime</u>
               set certificate lifetime.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.

               Set the certificate expiration to lifetime days from now.

       <b>-m</b> <u>modulus</u>, <b>--modulus</b>=<u>modulus</u>
               prime modulus.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>modulus</u> is
               constrained to being:
                   in the range  256 through 2048

               generate PC private certificate.

               Generate a private certificate.  By default, the program generates public certificates.

       <b>-p</b> <u>passwd</u>, <b>--password</b>=<u>passwd</u>
               local private password.

               Local files containing private data are encrypted with the DES-CBC algorithm and the specified
               password.  The same password must be specified to the local ntpd via the "crypto pw password"
               configuration command.  The default password is the local hostname.

       <b>-q</b> <u>passwd</u>, <b>--export-passwd</b>=<u>passwd</u>
               export IFF or GQ group keys with password.

               Export IFF or GQ identity group keys to the standard output, encrypted with the DES-CBC algorithm
               and the specified password.  The same password must be specified to the remote ntpd via the
               "crypto pw password" configuration command.  See also the option --id-key (-e) for unencrypted
               exports.

       <b>-s</b> <u>host@group</u>, <b>--subject-name</b>=<u>host@group</u>
               set host and optionally group name.

               Set the Autokey host name, and optionally, group name specified following an '<b>@</b>' character.  The
               host name is used in the file name of generated host and signing certificates, without the group
               name.  The host name, and if provided, group name are used in <b>host@group</b> form for the host
               certificate subject and issuer fields.  Specifying '<b>-s</b> <b>@group</b>' is allowed, and results in leaving
               the host name unchanged while appending <b>@group</b> to the subject and issuer fields, as with <b>-i</b>
               <b>group</b>.  The group name, or if not provided, the host name are also used in the file names of IFF,
               GQ, and MV client parameter files.

       <b>-S</b> <u>sign</u>, <b>--sign-key</b>=<u>sign</u>
               generate sign key (RSA or DSA).

               Generate a new sign key of the designated type, obsoleting any that may exist.  By default, the
               program uses the host key as the sign key.

       <b>-V</b> <u>num</u>, <b>--mv-params</b>=<u>num</u>
               generate &lt;num&gt; MV parameters.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.

               Generate parameters and keys for the Mu-Varadharajan (MV) identification scheme.

       <b>-v</b> <u>num</u>, <b>--mv-keys</b>=<u>num</u>
               update &lt;num&gt; MV keys.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.

               This option has not been fully documented.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
               Display usage information and exit.

       <b>-!</b>, <b>--more-help</b>

       <b>-&gt;</b> [<u>cfgfile</u>], <b>--save-opts</b> [=<u>cfgfile</u>]
               Save the option state to <u>cfgfile</u>.  The default is the <u>last</u> configuration file listed in the
               <b>OPTION</b> <b>PRESETS</b> section, below.  The command will exit after updating the config file.

       <b>-&lt;</b> <u>cfgfile</u>, <b>--load-opts</b>=<u>cfgfile</u>, <b>--no-load-opts</b>
               Load options from <u>cfgfile</u>.  The <u>no-load-opts</u> form will disable the loading of earlier
               config/rc/ini files.  <u>--no-load-opts</u> is handled early, out of order.

       <b>--version</b> [{<u>v|c|n</u>}]
               Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple version.  The `c' mode
               will print copyright information and `n' will print the full copyright notice.

</pre><h4><b>OPTION</b> <b>PRESETS</b></h4><pre>
       Any option that is not marked as <u>not</u> <u>presettable</u> may be preset by loading values from configuration ("RC"
       or ".INI") file(s) and values from environment variables named:
         <b>NTP_KEYGEN_&lt;option-name&gt;</b> or <b>NTP_KEYGEN</b>
       The environmental presets take precedence (are processed later than) the configuration files.  The <u>homerc</u>
       files are "<u>$HOME</u>", and "<u>.</u>".  If any of these are directories, then the file <u>.ntprc</u> is searched for within
       those directories.
