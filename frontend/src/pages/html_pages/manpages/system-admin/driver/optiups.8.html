</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       optiups - Driver for Opti-UPS (Viewsonic) UPS and Zinto D (ONLINE-USV) equipment

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>optiups</b> -h

       <b>optiups</b> -a <u>UPS_NAME</u> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]

           <b>Note</b>

           This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the optiups driver. For information
           about the core driver, see <b><a href="../man8/nutupsdrv.8.html">nutupsdrv</a></b>(8).

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>optiups</b> was originally written against a PowerES 280es in nut-0.45. It was revised for nut-2.0.1 and
       tested against a PowerES 420E. It is expected to work with at least the PowerES, PowerPS, and PowerVS
       models.

       This driver additionally supports a Zinto D from ONLINE USV-Systeme AG because of their very similar
       commands, but it is unknown if it also works with other UPS from them.

       This driver will not work with the PowerES stock serial cable. You will need to construct your own three
       conductor cable:

           UPS 6 -&gt; PC 3
           UPS 9 -&gt; PC 2
           UPS 4 -&gt; PC 5

       The cable for Online-USV uses pin UPS 7 (not UPS 4) → PC 5.

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       This driver supports the following optional settings in the <b><a href="../man5/ups.conf.5.html">ups.conf</a></b>(5) file:

       <b>status_only</b>
           Only poll for critical status information. Without this, <b>optiups</b> (and all NUT drivers) poll all sorts
           of information from the UPS fairly often. It is probably not often enough to hurt anything, so this
           option probably is not very useful, unless you have a flaky serial connection or a highly loaded
           machine.

       <b>nowarn_noimp</b>
           Does not print warnings when the UPS reports that a variable is not implemented or not pollable.
           Without the option you will get a message sent to your system logs each time NUT polls the UPS. If
           you specify <b>nowarn_noimp</b>, this message will only be logged once.

       <b>fake_lowbatt</b>
           This forces the low battery flag true. Without it, if you want to test your UPS, you will have to
           unplug it and wait until the battery drops to a low/critical voltage level before NUT will respond
           and power down your system. With the flag, NUT should power down the system soon after you pull the
           plug. When you are done testing, you should remove this flag.

           For basic shutdown configuration testing, the command <u>upsmon</u> <u>-c</u> <u>fsd</u> is preferred.

       <b>powerup</b>
           Zinto D from ONLINE-USV cannot be identified when switched to standby. Set this flag to allow the
           driver to power-up your Zinto UPS. This will also power-up your equipment connected to the UPS!

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       On the 420E, ups.serial and ups.temperature are unsupported features. This is not a bug in NUT or the NUT
       driver, just the way things are with this UPS.
