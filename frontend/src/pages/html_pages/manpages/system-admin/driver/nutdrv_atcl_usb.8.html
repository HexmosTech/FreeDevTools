</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nutdrv_atcl_usb - Driver for 'ATCL FOR UPS' equipment

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nutdrv_atcl_usb</b> -h

       <b>nutdrv_atcl_usb</b> -a <u>UPS_NAME</u> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]

           <b>Note</b>

           This man page only documents the specific features of the nutdrv_atcl_usb driver. For information
           about the core driver, see <b><a href="../man8/nutupsdrv.8.html">nutupsdrv</a></b>(8).

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       This driver is for UPS hardware which identifies itself as USB idVendor 0001 and idProduct 0000, and
       iManufacturer ATCL FOR UPS. Known manufacturers include Kanji and Plexus.

       The UPS interface seems to be a generic USB-to-serial chip, and for hardware manufactured by Kanji and
       Plexus, the microcontroller appears to emulate a traditional contact-closure interface. This translates
       into only three states in ups.status: <b>OL</b>, <b>OB</b> and <b>OB</b> <b>LB</b> (similar to <b><a href="../man8/genericups.8.html">genericups</a></b>(8)), with no other dynamic
       status values reported.

       Note that these USB identifiers (including the iManufacturer string) have also been seen on devices that
       are supported by the fuji subdriver of <b><a href="../man8/nutdrv_qx.8.html">nutdrv_qx</a></b>(8), and some others.

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       This driver supports the following optional setting:

       <b>vendor</b> <b>=</b> <u>name</u>
           In case your iManufacturer (Vendor) string does not exactly match ATCL FOR UPS, you may provide an
           alternate string here (or specify "NULL" if the device does not provide a vendor string but you want
           this driver to match).

           Note that a more likely case for mismatch is that your device is handled by another driver for
           0001:0000 devices, such as <b><a href="../man8/nutdrv_qx.8.html">nutdrv_qx</a></b>(8).

               <b>Note</b>
               This driver does not intend to support USB-matching settings common to other drivers, such as
               <b>vendorid</b>, <b>product</b>, <b>productid</b>, <b>serial</b>, <b>device</b> or <b>bus</b>; also the <b>vendor</b> setting supported here is
               not a regular expression.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The UPS returns the same code for "load power is off" as for "on line power". This condition will not be
       observed if the NUT upsmon in primary mode runs on the box powered by the UPS, but may be an issue if the
       UPS is monitored by a remote (secondary) system.

       The time between the shutdown command and removal of power seems to be fixed at 30 seconds. Ensure that
       the NUT shutdown script is invoked as late as possible in the shutdown procedure (in case some services
       take longer than others to clean up).

       Most contact-closure UPSes will not power down the load if the line power is present. This can create a
       race when using secondary <b><a href="../man8/upsmon.8.html">upsmon</a></b>(8) systems. See the <b><a href="../man8/upsmon.8.html">upsmon</a></b>(8) man page for more information. The
       solution to this problem is to upgrade to a smart protocol UPS of some kind that allows detection and
       proper load cycling on command.
