       ntfs-3g - Third Generation Read/Write NTFS Driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ntfs-3g</b> <b>[-o</b> <u>option</u><b>[,...]]</b>  <u>volume</u> <u>mount_point</u>
       <b>mount</b> <b>-t</b> <b>ntfs-3g</b> <b>[-o</b> <u>option</u><b>[,...]]</b>  <u>volume</u> <u>mount_point</u>
       <b>lowntfs-3g</b> <b>[-o</b> <u>option</u><b>[,...]]</b>  <u>volume</u> <u>mount_point</u>
       <b>mount</b> <b>-t</b> <b>lowntfs-3g</b> <b>[-o</b> <u>option</u><b>[,...]]</b>  <u>volume</u> <u>mount_point</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ntfs-3g</b>  is  an  NTFS  driver, which can create, remove, rename, move files, directories, hard links, and
       streams; it can read and write files, including streams, sparse files and transparently compressed files;
       it can handle special files like symbolic links,  devices,  and  FIFOs;  moreover  it  provides  standard
       management of file ownership and permissions, including POSIX ACLs.

       It  comes  in  two  variants  <b>ntfs-3g</b>  and  <b>lowntfs-3g</b> with a few differences mentioned below in relevant
       options descriptions.

       The <u>volume</u> to be mounted can be either a block device or an image file, either by using the mount command
       or starting the drive.

   <b>Windows</b> <b>hibernation</b> <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> <b>restarting</b>
       On computers which can be dual-booted into Windows or Linux, Windows has to be  fully  shut  down  before
       booting  into  Linux,  otherwise  the  NTFS file systems on internal disks may be left in an inconsistent
       state and changes made by Linux may be ignored by Windows.

       So, Windows may not be left in hibernation when  starting  Linux,  in  order  to  avoid  inconsistencies.
       Moreover,  the  fast  restart feature available on recent Windows systems has to be disabled. This can be
       achieved by issuing as an Administrator the Windows command which  disables  both  hibernation  and  fast
       restarting :

              powercfg /h off

       If  either  Windows is hibernated or its fast restart is enabled, partitions on internal disks are forced
       to be mounted in read-only mode.

   <b>Access</b> <b>Handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>Security</b>
       By default, files and directories are owned by the effective user and group of the mounting process,  and
       everybody  has  full  read,  write,  execution  and  directory browsing permissions.  You can also assign
       permissions to a single user by using the <b>uid</b> and/or the <b>gid</b> options together with the  <b>umask,</b>  or  <b>fmask</b>
       and <b>dmask</b> options.

       Doing so, all Windows users have full access to the files created by <b>ntfs-3g.</b>

       But,  by setting the <b>permissions</b> option, you can benefit from the full ownership and permissions features
       as defined by  POSIX.  Moreover,  by  defining  a  Windows-to-Linux  user  mapping,  the  ownerships  and
       permissions are even applied to Windows users and conversely.

       If <b>ntfs-3g</b> is set setuid-root then non-root users will be also able to mount volumes.

   <b>Windows</b> <b>Filename</b> <b>Compatibility</b>
       NTFS  supports several filename namespaces: DOS, Win32 and POSIX. While the <b>ntfs-3g</b> driver handles all of
       them, it always creates new files in the POSIX namespace for  maximum  portability  and  interoperability
       reasons.   This  means  that  filenames  are case sensitive and all characters are allowed except '/' and
       '\0'. This is perfectly  legal  on  Windows,  though  some  application  may  get  confused.  The  option
       <b>windows_names</b> may be used to apply Windows restrictions to new file names.

   <b>Alternate</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Streams</b> <b>(ADS)</b>
       NTFS  stores  all data in streams. Every file has exactly one unnamed data stream and can have many named
       data streams.  The size of a file is the size of its unnamed data stream.  By default, <b>ntfs-3g</b> will  only
       read the unnamed data stream.

       By  using  the  option <b>streams_interface=windows</b>, with the ntfs-3g driver (not possible with lowntfs-3g),
       you will be able to read any named data streams, simply by specifying the stream name after a colon.  For
       example:

              cat some.mp3:artist

       Named data streams act like normal files, so you can read from them, write to them and even  delete  them
       (using rm).  You can list all the named data streams a file has by getting the <b>ntfs.streams.list</b> extended
       attribute.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Below is a summary of the options that <b>ntfs-3g</b> accepts.

       <b>acl</b>    Enable  setting  Posix ACLs on created files and use them for access control.  This option is only
              available on specific builds. It is set by default when a user mapping file  is  present  and  the
              <b>permissions</b> mount option is not set.

       <b>allow_other</b>
              This  option  overrides  the  security  measure  restricting  file access to the user mounting the
              filesystem. This option is only allowed to root, but this restriction can  be  overridden  by  the
              <b>user_allow_other</b> option in the <a href="file:/etc/fuse.conf">/etc/fuse.conf</a> file.

       <b>atime,</b> <b>noatime,</b> <b>relatime</b>
              The <b>atime</b> option updates inode access time for each access.

              The  <b>noatime</b>  option  disables  inode  access time updates, which can speed up file operations and
              prevent sleeping (notebook) disks spinning up too often thus saving energy and disk lifetime.

              The <b>relatime</b> option is very similar to <b>noatime.</b>  It updates inode access times relative to  modify
              or  change time.  The access time is only updated if the previous access time was earlier than the
              current modify or change time. Unlike <b>noatime</b> this option doesn't break applications that need  to
              know if a file has been read since the last time it was modified.  This is the default behaviour.

       <b>big_writes</b>
              This  option prevents fuse from splitting write buffers into 4K chunks, enabling big write buffers
              to be transferred from the application in a single step (up to some system limit,  generally  128K
              bytes).

       <b>compression</b>
              This  option  enables  creating  new  transparently  compressed  files  in  directories marked for
              compression. A directory is marked for compression by setting the bit 11 (value 0x00000800) in its
              Windows attribute. In such a directory, new files are created compressed  and  new  subdirectories
              are  themselves  marked for compression. The option and the flag have no effect on existing files.
              Currently this is the default option.

       <b>debug</b>  Makes ntfs-3g (or lowntfs-3g) to print a lot of debug output from libntfs-3g and FUSE.

       <b>delay_mtime[=</b> <b>value]</b>
              Only update the file modification time and the file change time of a file when  it  is  closed  or
              when  the  indicated  delay  since  the  previous  update has elapsed. The argument is a number of
              seconds, with a default value of 60.  This is mainly useful for big files which are kept open  for
              a  long  time  and written to without changing their size, such as databases or file system images
              mounted as loop.

       <b>dmask=</b><u>value</u>
              Set the  bitmask of the directory permissions that are not present. The value is given  in  octal.
              The default value is 0 which means full access to everybody.

       <b>efs_raw</b>
              This  option  should only be used in backup or restore situation.  It changes the apparent size of
              files and the behavior of read and write operation so  that  encrypted  files  can  be  saved  and
              restored  without  being  decrypted. The <b>user.ntfs.efsinfo</b> extended attribute has also to be saved
              and restored for the file to be decrypted.

       <b>fmask=</b><u>value</u>
              Set the  bitmask of the file permissions that are not present.  The value is given in  octal.  The
              default value is 0 which means full access to everybody.

       <b>force</b>  This option is obsolete. It has been superseded by the <b>recover</b> and <b>norecover</b> options.

       <b>hide_dot_files</b>
              Set  the hidden flag in the NTFS attribute for created files and directories whose first character
              of the name is a dot. Such files and directories normally do not appear in directory listings, and
              when the flag is set they do not appear in Windows directory displays  either.   When  a  file  is
              renamed or linked with a new name, the hidden flag is adjusted to the latest name.

       <b>hide_hid_files</b>
              Hide  the  hidden  files  and  directories in directory listings, the hidden files and directories
              being the ones whose NTFS attribute have the hidden flag  set.   The  hidden  files  will  not  be
              selected when using wildcards in commands, but all files and directories remain accessible by full
              name,  for  example  you  can  always  display  the  Windows  trash  bin  directory  by  : "ls -ld
              '$RECYCLE.BIN'".

       <b>ignore_case</b> (only with lowntfs-3g)
              Ignore character case when accessing a file (<b>FOO</b>, <b>Foo</b>, <b>foo</b>, etc. designate  the  same  file).  All
              files are displayed with lower case in directory listings.

       <b>inherit</b>
              When  creating  a  new file, set its initial protections according to inheritance rules defined in
              parent directory. These rules deviate from  Posix  specifications,  but  yield  a  better  Windows
              compatibility.  The  <b>permissions</b>  (or **acl**) option or a valid user mapping file is required for
              this option to be effective.

       <b>locale=</b><u>value</u>
              This option can be useful when wanting a language specific  locale  environment.   It  is  however
              discouraged as it leads to files with untranslatable characters to not be visible.

       <b>max_read=</b><u>value</u>
              With  this  option the maximum size of read operations can be set.  The default is infinite.  Note
              that the size of read requests is limited anyway by the system (usually to 128kbyte).

       <b>no_def_opts</b>
              By default ntfs-3g acts as if <b>silent</b> (ignore permission errors when permissions are not  enabled),
              <b>allow_other</b>  (allow  any  user  to  access  files)  and  <b>nonempty</b>  (allow  mounting  on  non-empty
              directories) were set, and <b>no_def_opts</b> cancels these default options.

       <b>no_detach</b>
              Makes ntfs-3g to not detach from terminal and print some debug output.

       <b>nocompression</b>
              This option disables creating  new  transparently  compressed  files  in  directories  marked  for
              compression. Existing compressed files can still be read and updated.

       <b>norecover</b>
              Do not try to mount a partition which was not unmounted properly by Windows.

       <b>permissions</b>
              Set  standard permissions on created files and use standard access control.  This option is set by
              default when a user mapping file is present.

       <b>posix_nlink</b>
              Compute the count of hard links of a file or directory according to the POSIX specifications. When
              this option is not set, a count of 1 is set for directories,  and  the  short  name  of  files  is
              accounted  for.   Using  the  option entails some penalty as the count is not stored and has to be
              computed.

       <b>recover</b>
              Recover and try to mount a partition which was not unmounted  properly  by  Windows.  The  Windows
              logfile is cleared, which may cause inconsistencies.  Currently this is the default option.

       <b>remove_hiberfile</b>
              When  the NTFS volume is hibernated, a read-write mount is denied and a read-only mount is forced.
              One needs either to resume Windows and shutdown it properly, or use this option which will  remove
              the  Windows  hibernation  file.  Please  note,  this means that the saved Windows session will be
              completely lost. Use this option under your own responsibility.

       <b>ro</b>     Mount the filesystem read-only. Useful if Windows is  hibernated  or  the  NTFS  journal  file  is
              unclean.

       <b>show_sys_files</b>
              Show  the  metafiles  in  directory  listings.  Otherwise  the  default  behaviour  is to hide the
              metafiles, which are special files used to store the NTFS structure. Please note  that  even  when
              this  option  is  specified,  "$MFT"  may  not  be  visible  due  to  a  glibc  bug.  Furthermore,
              irrespectively of <b>show_sys_files</b>, all files are accessible by name, for example you can always  do
              "ls -l '$UpCase'".

       <b>silent</b> Do  nothing, without returning any error, on chmod and chown operations and on permission checking
              errors, when the <b>permissions</b> option is not set and no user mapping file is defined. This option is
              on by default, and when set off (through option <b>no_def_opts</b>) ownership and permissions  parameters
              have to be set.

       <b>special_files=</b><u>mode</u>
              This  option  selects a mode for representing a special file to be created (symbolic link, socket,
              fifo, character or block device). The <u>mode</u> can be <b>interix</b> or <b>wsl</b>, and  existing  files  in  either
              mode  are  recognized  irrespective of the selected mode. Interix is the traditional mode, used by
              default, and wsl is interoperable with Windows WSL, but it is not compatible with Windows versions
              earlier than Windows 10.  Neither mode are interoperable with Windows.

       <b>streams_interface=</b><u>mode</u>
              This option controls how the user can access Alternate Data Streams (ADS) or in other words, named
              data streams. The <u>mode</u> can be set to one of <b>none</b>, <b>windows</b> or <b>xattr</b>. If the option is set to  <b>none</b>,
              the user will have no access to the named data streams. If it is set to <b>windows</b> (not possible with
              lowntfs-3g), then the user can access them just like in Windows (eg. cat file:stream). If it's set
              to  <b>xattr</b>, then the named data streams are mapped to extended attributes and a user can manipulate
              them using <b>{get,set}fattr</b> utilities. The default is <b>xattr</b>.

       <b>uid=</b><u>value</u> and <b>gid=</b><u>value</u>
              Set the owner and the group of files and directories. The values are numerical.  The defaults  are
              the uid and gid of the current process.

       <b>umask=</b><u>value</u>
              Set the  bitmask of the file and directory permissions that are not present. The value is given in
              octal. The default value is 0 which means full access to everybody.

       <b>usermapping=</b><u>file-name</u>
              Use  file <u>file-name</u> as the user mapping file instead of the default <b>.NTFS-3G/UserMapping</b>. If <u>file-</u>
              <u>name</u> defines a full path, the file must be located  on  a  partition  previously  mounted.  If  it
              defines a relative path, it is interpreted relative to the root of NTFS partition being mounted.

              When a user mapping file is defined, the options <b>uid=</b>, <b>gid=</b>, <b>umask=</b>, <b>fmask=</b>, <b>dmask=</b> and <b>silent</b> are
              ignored.

       <b>user_xattr</b>
              Same as <b>streams_interface=</b><u>xattr</u>.

       <b>windows_names</b>
              This  option  prevents  files,  directories  and extended attributes to be created with a name not
              allowed by windows, because

                     - it contains some not allowed character,
                     - or the last character is a space or a dot,
                     - or the name is reserved.

              The forbidden characters are the nine characters " * / : &lt; &gt; ? \ | and those whose  code  is  less
              than  0x20,  and the reserved names are CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1..COM9, LPT1..LPT9, with no suffix
              or followed by a dot.

              Existing such files can still be read (and renamed).

</pre><h4><b>USER</b> <b>MAPPING</b></h4><pre>
       NTFS uses specific ids to record the ownership of files instead of the <b>uid</b> (user id) and <b>gid</b>  (group  id)
       used by Linux. As a consequence a mapping between the ids has to be defined for ownerships to be recorded
       into NTFS files and recognized.

       By default, this mapping is fetched from the file <b>.NTFS-3G/UserMapping</b> located in the NTFS partition. The
       option <b>usermapping=</b> may be used to define another location. When the option **permissions** is set and no
       mapping file is found, a default mapping is used.

       Each  line  in  the  user  mapping  file  defines a mapping. It is organized in three fields separated by
       colons. The first field identifies a <b>uid</b>, the second field identifies a <b>gid</b> and the third one  identifies
       the corresponding NTFS id, known as a <b>SID</b>. The <b>uid</b> and the <b>gid</b> are optional and defining both of them for
       the same <b>SID</b> is not recommended.

       If  no  interoperation  with  Windows  is needed, you can use the option <b>permissions</b> to define a standard
       mapping. Alternately, you may define your own mapping by setting a single default mapping with no uid and
       gid. In both cases, files created on Linux will appear to Windows as owned by a foreign user,  and  files
       created  on  Windows will appear to Linux as owned by root. Just copy the example below and replace the 9
       and 10-digit numbers by any number not greater than 4294967295. The resulting behavior is the same as the
       one with the option <b>permission</b> set with no ownership option and no user mapping file available.

              <b>::S-1-5-21-3141592653-589793238-462643383-10000</b>

       If a strong interoperation with Windows is needed, the mapping has to be defined for each user and  group
       known  to both system, and the <b>SID</b>s used by Windows has to be collected. This will lead to a user mapping
       file like :

              <b>john::S-1-5-21-3141592653-589793238-462643383-1008</b>
              <b>mary::S-1-5-21-3141592653-589793238-462643383-1009</b>
              <b>:smith:S-1-5-21-3141592653-589793238-462643383-513</b> <b>::S-1-5-21-3141592653-589793238-462643383-10000</b>

       The utility <b>ntfsusermap</b> may be used to create such a user mapping file.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Mount /dev/sda1 to /mnt/windows:

              <b>ntfs-3g</b> <b>/dev/sda1</b> <b>/mnt/windows</b>
       or
              <b>mount</b> <b>-t</b> <b>ntfs-3g</b> <b>/dev/sda1</b> <b>/mnt/windows</b>

       Mount the ntfs data partition /dev/sda3 to /mnt/data with standard Linux permissions applied :

              <b>ntfs-3g</b> <b>-o</b> <b>permissions</b> <b>/dev/sda3</b> <b>/mnt/data</b>
       or
              <b>mount</b> <b>-t</b> <b>ntfs-3g</b> <b>-o</b> <b>permissions</b> <b>/dev/sda3</b> <b>/mnt/data</b>

       Read-only mount /dev/sda5 to /home/user/mnt and make user with uid 1000 to be the owner of all files:

              <b>ntfs-3g</b> <b>/dev/sda5</b> <b>/home/user/mnt</b> <b>-o</b> <b>ro,uid=1000</b>

       <a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a> entry for the above (the sixth and last field has to be zero to avoid a file system  check  at
       boot time) :

              <b>/dev/sda5</b> <b>/home/user/mnt</b> <b>ntfs-3g</b> <b>ro,uid=1000</b> <b>0</b> <b>0</b>

       Unmount /mnt/windows:

              <b>umount</b> <b>/mnt/windows</b>

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       To facilitate the use of the <b>ntfs-3g</b> driver in scripts, an exit code is returned to give an indication of
       the  mountability status of a volume. Value 0 means success, and all other ones mean an error. The unique
       error codes are documented in the <b><a href="../man8/ntfs-3g.probe.8.html">ntfs-3g.probe</a></b>(8) manual page.
