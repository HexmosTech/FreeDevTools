</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>puppet-key</b> - Create, save, and remove certificate keys.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       puppet key <u>action</u> [--terminus _TERMINUS] [--extra HASH]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This subcommand manages certificate private keys. Keys are created automatically by puppet agent and when
       certificate  requests are generated with 'puppet certificate generate'; it should not be necessary to use
       this subcommand directly.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that any setting that's valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument,  although  it
       may or may not be relevant to the present action. For example, <b>server</b> and <b>run_mode</b> are valid settings, so
       you can specify <b>--server</b> <b>&lt;servername&gt;</b>, or <b>--run_mode</b> <b>&lt;runmode&gt;</b> as an argument.

       See  the configuration file documentation at <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/configuration.html</u> for
       the full list of acceptable parameters. A commented  list  of  all  configuration  options  can  also  be
       generated by running puppet with <b>--genconfig</b>.

       --render-as FORMAT
              The  format  in  which  to  render output. The most common formats are <b>json</b>, <b>s</b> (string), <b>yaml</b>, and
              <b>console</b>, but other options such as <b>dot</b> are sometimes available.

       --verbose
              Whether to log verbosely.

       --debug
              Whether to log debug information.

       --extra HASH
              A terminus can take additional arguments to refine the operation, which are passed as an arbitrary
              hash to the back-end. Anything passed as the extra value is just send direct to the back-end.

       --terminus _TERMINUS
              Indirector faces expose indirected subsystems  of  Puppet.  These  subsystems  are  each  able  to
              retrieve  and  alter a specific type of data (with the familiar actions of <b>find</b>, <b>search</b>, <b>save</b>, and
              <b>destroy</b>) from an arbitrary number of pluggable backends. In Puppet parlance,  these  backends  are
              called terminuses.

              Almost  all  indirected  subsystems  have  a <b>rest</b> terminus that interacts with the puppet master's
              data. Most of them have additional terminuses for various local data models,  which  are  in  turn
              used by the indirected subsystem on the puppet master whenever it receives a remote request.

              The  terminus  for  an  action  is  often  determined by context, but occasionally needs to be set
              explicitly. See the "Notes" section of this face's manpage for more details.

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>destroy</b> - Delete an object.
              <b>SYNOPSIS</b>

              puppet key destroy [--terminus _TERMINUS] [--extra HASH] <u>key</u>

              <b>DESCRIPTION</b>

              Delete an object.

       <b>find</b> - Retrieve an object by name.
              <b>SYNOPSIS</b>

              puppet key find [--terminus _TERMINUS] [--extra HASH] [<u>key</u>]

              <b>DESCRIPTION</b>

              Retrieve an object by name.

       <b>info</b> - Print the default terminus class for this face.
              <b>SYNOPSIS</b>

              puppet key info [--terminus _TERMINUS] [--extra HASH]

              <b>DESCRIPTION</b>

              Prints the default terminus class for this subcommand. Note that  different  run  modes  may  have
              different default termini; when in doubt, specify the run mode with the '--run_mode' option.

       <b>save</b> - API only: create or overwrite an object.
              <b>SYNOPSIS</b>

              puppet key save [--terminus _TERMINUS] [--extra HASH] <u>key</u>

              <b>DESCRIPTION</b>

              API  only:  create  or  overwrite an object. As the Faces framework does not currently accept data
              from STDIN, save actions cannot currently be invoked from the command line.

       <b>search</b> - Search for an object or retrieve multiple objects.
              <b>SYNOPSIS</b>

              puppet key search [--terminus _TERMINUS] [--extra HASH] <u>query</u>

              <b>DESCRIPTION</b>

              Search for an object or retrieve multiple objects.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
