</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>puppet-status</b> - View puppet server status.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       puppet status <u>action</u> [--terminus _TERMINUS] [--extra HASH]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Note  that  any setting that's valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument, although it
       may or may not be relevant to the present action. For example, <b>server</b> and <b>run_mode</b> are valid settings, so
       you can specify <b>--server</b> <b>&lt;servername&gt;</b>, or <b>--run_mode</b> <b>&lt;runmode&gt;</b> as an argument.

       See the configuration file documentation at <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/configuration.html</u>  for
       the  full  list  of  acceptable  parameters.  A  commented  list of all configuration options can also be
       generated by running puppet with <b>--genconfig</b>.

       --render-as FORMAT
              The format in which to render output. The most common formats are  <b>json</b>,  <b>s</b>  (string),  <b>yaml</b>,  and
              <b>console</b>, but other options such as <b>dot</b> are sometimes available.

       --verbose
              Whether to log verbosely.

       --debug
              Whether to log debug information.

       --extra HASH
              A terminus can take additional arguments to refine the operation, which are passed as an arbitrary
              hash to the back-end. Anything passed as the extra value is just send direct to the back-end.

       --terminus _TERMINUS
              Indirector  faces  expose  indirected  subsystems  of  Puppet.  These  subsystems are each able to
              retrieve and alter a specific type of data (with the familiar actions of <b>find</b>, <b>search</b>,  <b>save</b>,  and
              <b>destroy</b>)  from  an  arbitrary number of pluggable backends. In Puppet parlance, these backends are
              called terminuses.

              Almost all indirected subsystems have a <b>rest</b> terminus that  interacts  with  the  puppet  master's
              data.  Most  of  them  have additional terminuses for various local data models, which are in turn
              used by the indirected subsystem on the puppet master whenever it receives a remote request.

              The terminus for an action is often determined by  context,  but  occasionally  needs  to  be  set
              explicitly. See the "Notes" section of this face's manpage for more details.

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>find</b> - Check status of puppet master server.
              <b>SYNOPSIS</b>

              puppet status [--terminus _TERMINUS] [--extra HASH] [<u>key</u>]

              <b>DESCRIPTION</b>

              Checks  whether a Puppet server is properly receiving and processing HTTP requests. This action is
              only useful when used with '--terminus rest'; when invoked with  the  <b>local</b>  terminus,  <b>find</b>  will
              always return true.

              Over REST, this action will query the configured puppet master by default. To query other servers,
              including puppet agent nodes started with the <u>--listen</u> option, you can set the global <u>--server</u> and
              <u>--masterport</u> options on the command line; note that agent nodes listen on port 8139.

              <b>RETURNS</b>

              A  "true"  response  or  a  low-level  connection  error.  When  used from the Ruby API: returns a
              Puppet::Status object.

              <b>NOTES</b>

              This action requires that the server's <b>auth.conf</b>  file  allow  find  access  to  the  <b>status</b>  REST
              terminus.  Puppet  agent  does  not  use  this  facility,  and  it  is  turned off by default. See
              <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/config_file_auth.html</u> for more details.

       <b>info</b> - Print the default terminus class for this face.
              <b>SYNOPSIS</b>

              puppet status info [--terminus _TERMINUS] [--extra HASH]

              <b>DESCRIPTION</b>

              Prints the default terminus class for this subcommand. Note that  different  run  modes  may  have
              different default termini; when in doubt, specify the run mode with the '--run_mode' option.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>find</b>

       Check the status of the configured puppet master:

       $ puppet status find --terminus rest

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This  subcommand  is  an  indirector  face,  which exposes <b>find</b>, <b>search</b>, <b>save</b>, and <b>destroy</b> actions for an
       indirected subsystem of Puppet. Valid termini for this face include:

       ○   <b>local</b>

       ○   <b>rest</b>
