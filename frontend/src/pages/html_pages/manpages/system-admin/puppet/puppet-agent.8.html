</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>puppet-agent</b> - The puppet agent daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Retrieves the client configuration from the Puppet master and applies it to the local host.

       This  service  may  be  run  as  a  daemon,  run  periodically  using cron (or something similar), or run
       interactively for testing purposes.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       puppet  agent  [--certname  <u>NAME</u>]  [-D|--daemonize|--no-daemonize]  [-d|--debug]   [--detailed-exitcodes]
       [--digest   <u>DIGEST</u>]   [--disable   [MESSAGE]]   [--enable]   [--fingerprint]   [-h|--help]  [-l|--logdest
       syslog|eventlog|<u>ABS</u>  <u>FILEPATH</u>|console]  [--serverport  <u>PORT</u>]  [--noop]  [-o|--onetime]   [--sourceaddress
       <u>IP_ADDRESS</u>] [-t|--test] [-v|--verbose] [-V|--version] [-w|--waitforcert <u>SECONDS</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  the  main puppet client. Its job is to retrieve the local machine's configuration from a remote
       server and apply it. In order to successfully communicate with the remote server, the client must have  a
       certificate signed by a certificate authority that the server trusts; the recommended method for this, at
       the  moment,  is  to run a certificate authority as part of the puppet server (which is the default). The
       client will connect and request a signed certificate, and will continue connecting until it receives one.

       Once the client has a signed certificate, it will retrieve its configuration and apply it.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       'puppet agent' does its best to find a compromise between interactive use and daemon use. If you  run  it
       with  no  arguments  and  no  configuration,  it  goes  into  the  background,  attempts  to get a signed
       certificate, and retrieves and applies its configuration every 30 minutes.

       Some flags are meant specifically for interactive use -- in particular, 'test', 'tags' and  'fingerprint'
       are useful.

       '--test'  runs  once  in the foreground with verbose logging, then exits. It also exits if it can't get a
       valid catalog. <b>--test</b> includes the '--detailed-exitcodes' option by default and exits  with  one  of  the
       following exit codes:

       •   0: The run succeeded with no changes or failures; the system was already in the desired state.

       •   1: The run failed, or wasn't attempted due to another run already in progress.

       •   2: The run succeeded, and some resources were changed.

       •   4: The run succeeded, and some resources failed.

       •   6: The run succeeded, and included both changes and failures.

       '--tags'  allows  you  to specify what portions of a configuration you want to apply. Puppet elements are
       tagged with all of the class or definition names that contain them, and you can use the  'tags'  flag  to
       specify one of these names, causing only configuration elements contained within that class or definition
       to  be  applied.  This is very useful when you are testing new configurations -- for instance, if you are
       just starting to manage 'ntpd', you would put all of the new elements into  an  'ntpd'  class,  and  call
       puppet  with  '--tags  ntpd',  which would only apply that small portion of the configuration during your
       testing, rather than applying the whole thing.

       '--fingerprint' is a one-time flag. In this mode 'puppet agent' runs once and  displays  on  the  console
       (and  in  the log) the current certificate (or certificate request) fingerprint. Providing the '--digest'
       option allows you to use a different digest algorithm to generate the fingerprint. The  main  use  is  to
       verify  that  before  signing  a  certificate  request  on the master, the certificate request the master
       received is the same as the one the client  sent  (to  prevent  against  man-in-the-middle  attacks  when
       signing certificates).

       '--skip_tags' is a flag used to filter resources. If this is set, then only resources not tagged with the
       specified tags will be applied. Values must be comma-separated.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Note  that  any  Puppet setting that's valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument. For
       example, 'server' is a valid setting, so you can specify '--server <u>servername</u>' as  an  argument.  Boolean
       settings  accept a '--no-' prefix to turn off a behavior, translating into '--setting' and '--no-setting'
       pairs, such as <b>--daemonize</b> and <b>--no-daemonize</b>.

       See the configuration file documentation at https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/configuration.html  for
       the  full  list of acceptable settings. A commented list of all settings can also be generated by running
       puppet agent with '--genconfig'.

       •   --certname: Set the certname (unique ID) of the client. The  master  reads  this  unique  identifying
           string,  which  is  usually  set  to  the  node's  fully-qualified  domain  name,  to determine which
           configurations the node will receive. Use this option to debug setup problems  or  implement  unusual
           node identification schemes. (This is a Puppet setting, and can go in puppet.conf.)

       •   --daemonize:  Send  the  process into the background. This is the default. (This is a Puppet setting,
           and can go in puppet.conf. Note the special 'no-' prefix for boolean settings on the command line.)

       •   --no-daemonize: Do not send the process into the background. (This is a Puppet setting, and can go in
           puppet.conf. Note the special 'no-' prefix for boolean settings on the command line.)

       •   --debug: Enable full debugging.

       •   --detailed-exitcodes: Provide extra information about the run via exit codes; works only if  '--test'
           or '--onetime' is also specified. If enabled, 'puppet agent' uses the following exit codes:

           0: The run succeeded with no changes or failures; the system was already in the desired state.

           1: The run failed, or wasn't attempted due to another run already in progress.

           2: The run succeeded, and some resources were changed.

           4: The run succeeded, and some resources failed.

           6: The run succeeded, and included both changes and failures.

       •   --digest: Change the certificate fingerprinting digest algorithm. The default is SHA256. Valid values
           depends on the version of OpenSSL installed, but will likely contain MD5, MD2, SHA1 and SHA256.

       •   --disable:  Disable  working  on  the  local  system. This puts a lock file in place, causing 'puppet
           agent' not to work on the system until the lock file is removed. This is useful if you are testing  a
           configuration  and do not want the central configuration to override the local state until everything
           is tested and committed.

           Disable can also take an optional message that will be reported by the 'puppet  agent'  at  the  next
           disabled run.

           'puppet  agent'  uses  the  same  lock  file  while it is running, so no more than one 'puppet agent'
           process is working at a time.

           'puppet agent' exits after executing this.

       •   --enable: Enable working on the local system. This removes any lock file, causing 'puppet  agent'  to
           start managing the local system again However, it continues to use its normal scheduling, so it might
           not start for another half hour.

           'puppet agent' exits after executing this.

       •   --evaltrace:  Logs  each  resource  as  it  is  being evaluated. This allows you to interactively see
           exactly what is being done. (This is a Puppet setting, and can go in puppet.conf.  Note  the  special
           'no-' prefix for boolean settings on the command line.)

       •   --fingerprint:  Display  the  current certificate or certificate signing request fingerprint and then
           exit. Use the '--digest' option to change the digest algorithm used.

       •   --help: Print this help message

       •   --job-id: Attach the specified job id to the catalog request and the report used for this agent  run.
           This option only works when '--onetime' is used. When using Puppet Enterprise this flag should not be
           used as the orchestrator sets the job-id for you and it must be unique.

       •   --logdest: Where to send log messages. Choose between 'syslog' (the POSIX syslog service), 'eventlog'
           (the  Windows Event Log), 'console', or the path to a log file. If debugging or verbosity is enabled,
           this defaults to 'console'. Otherwise, it defaults to 'syslog' on POSIX  systems  and  'eventlog'  on
           Windows.    Multiple    destinations    can    be   set   using   a   comma   separated   list   (eg:
           <b>/path/file1,console,/path/file2</b>)"

           A path ending with '.json' will receive structured output in JSON format. The log file will not  have
           an ending ']' automatically written to it due to the appending nature of logging. It must be appended
           manually to make the content valid JSON.

           A path ending with '.jsonl' will receive structured output in JSON Lines format.

       •   --masterport:  The  port on which to contact the Puppet Server. (This is a Puppet setting, and can go
           in puppet.conf. Deprecated in favor of the 'serverport' setting.)

       •   --noop: Use 'noop' mode where the daemon runs in a no-op or dry-run mode. This is useful  for  seeing
           what changes Puppet would make without actually executing the changes. (This is a Puppet setting, and
           can go in puppet.conf. Note the special 'no-' prefix for boolean settings on the command line.)

       •   --onetime:  Run  the  configuration  once. Runs a single (normally daemonized) Puppet run. Useful for
           interactively running puppet agent when used in conjunction with the --no-daemonize option. (This  is
           a  Puppet  setting,  and can go in puppet.conf. Note the special 'no-' prefix for boolean settings on
           the command line.)

       •   --serverport: The port on which to contact the Puppet Server. (This is a Puppet setting, and  can  go
           in puppet.conf.)

       •   --sourceaddress: Set the source IP address for transactions. This defaults to automatically selected.
           (This is a Puppet setting, and can go in puppet.conf.)

       •   --test:   Enable  the  most  common  options  used  for  testing.  These  are  'onetime',  'verbose',
           'no-daemonize', 'no-usecacheonfailure', 'detailed-exitcodes', 'no-splay', and 'show_diff'.

       •   --trace Prints stack traces on some errors. (This is a Puppet setting, and  can  go  in  puppet.conf.
           Note the special 'no-' prefix for boolean settings on the command line.)

       •   --verbose: Turn on verbose reporting.

       •   --version: Print the puppet version number and exit.

       •   --waitforcert:  This  option  only  matters  for  daemons that do not yet have certificates and it is
           enabled by default, with a value of 120 (seconds). This causes  'puppet  agent'  to  connect  to  the
           server every 2 minutes and ask it to sign a certificate request. This is useful for the initial setup
           of  a  puppet client. You can turn off waiting for certificates by specifying a time of 0. (This is a
           Puppet setting, and can go in puppet.conf.)

       •   --write_catalog_summary After compiling the catalog saves the resource list and classes list  to  the
           node in the state directory named classes.txt and resources.txt (This is a Puppet setting, and can go
           in puppet.conf.)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       $ puppet agent --server puppet.domain.com

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Puppet agent accepts the following signals:

       SIGHUP Restart the puppet agent daemon.

       SIGINT and SIGTERM
              Shut down the puppet agent daemon.

       SIGUSR1
              Immediately retrieve and apply configurations from the puppet master.

       SIGUSR2
              Close file descriptors for log files and reopen them. Used with logrotate.
