</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>puppet-device</b> - Manage remote network devices

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Retrieves catalogs from the Puppet master and applies them to remote devices.

       This subcommand can be run manually; or periodically using cron, a scheduled task, or a similar tool.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       puppet    device    [-h|--help]    [-v|--verbose]    [-d|--debug]    [-l|--logdest   syslog|<u>file</u>|console]
       [--detailed-exitcodes] [--deviceconfig <u>file</u>] [-w|--waitforcert <u>seconds</u>] [--libdir <u>directory</u>]  [-a|--apply
       <u>file</u>] [-f|--facts] [-r|--resource <u>type</u> [name]] [-t|--target <u>device</u>] [--user=<u>user</u>] [-V|--version]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Devices require a proxy Puppet agent to request certificates, collect facts, retrieve and apply catalogs,
       and store reports.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Devices managed by the puppet-device subcommand on a Puppet agent are configured in device.conf, which is
       located at $confdir/device.conf by default, and is configurable with the $deviceconfig setting.

       The device.conf file is an INI-like file, with one section per device:

       [<u>DEVICE_CERTNAME</u>] type <u>TYPE</u> url <u>URL</u> debug

       The section name specifies the certname of the device.

       The values for the type and url properties are specific to each type of device.

       The  optional  debug  property  specifies  transport-level  debugging,  and  is limited to telnet and ssh
       transports.

       See https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/config_file_device.html for details.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that any setting that's valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument. For  example,
       'server' is a valid configuration parameter, so you can specify '--server <u>servername</u>' as an argument.

       --help, -h
              Print this help message

       --verbose, -v
              Turn on verbose reporting.

       --debug, -d
              Enable full debugging.

       --logdest, -l
              Where  to send log messages. Choose between 'syslog' (the POSIX syslog service), 'console', or the
              path to a log file. If debugging or verbosity is enabled, this defaults to  'console'.  Otherwise,
              it  defaults  to  'syslog'.  Multiple  destinations  can  be set using a comma separated list (eg:
              <b>/path/file1,console,/path/file2</b>)"

              A path ending with '.json' will receive structured output in JSON format. The log  file  will  not
              have  an ending ']' automatically written to it due to the appending nature of logging. It must be
              appended manually to make the content valid JSON.

       --detailed-exitcodes
              Provide transaction information via exit codes. If this is enabled, an exit code of '1'  means  at
              least one device had a compile failure, an exit code of '2' means at least one device had resource
              changes,  and  an  exit code of '4' means at least one device had resource failures. Exit codes of
              '3', '5', '6', or '7' means that a bitwise combination of the preceding exit codes happened.

       --deviceconfig
              Path to the device config file for puppet device. Default: $confdir/device.conf

       --waitforcert, -w
              This option only matters for targets that do not yet  have  certificates  and  it  is  enabled  by
              default,  with  a  value  of 120 (seconds). This causes +puppet device+ to poll the server every 2
              minutes and ask it to sign a certificate request. This is  useful  for  the  initial  setup  of  a
              target. You can turn off waiting for certificates by specifying a time of 0.

       --libdir
              Override  the  per-device  libdir  with  a  local  directory.  Specifying  a  libdir also disables
              pluginsync. This is useful for testing.

              A path ending with '.jsonl' will receive structured output in JSON Lines format.

       --apply
              Apply a manifest against a remote target. Target must be specified.

       --facts
              Displays the facts of a remote target. Target must be specified.

       --resource
              Displays a resource state as Puppet code, roughly equivalent to <b>puppet</b> <b>resource</b>. Can  be  filtered
              by title. Requires --target be specified.

       --target
              Target  a  specific  device/certificate  in  the  device.conf.  Doing so will perform a device run
              against only that device/certificate.

       --to_yaml
              Output found resources in yaml format, suitable to use with Hiera and create_resources.

       --user The user to run as.
