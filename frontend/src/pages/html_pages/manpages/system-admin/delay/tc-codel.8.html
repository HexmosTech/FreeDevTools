       CoDel - Controlled-Delay Active Queue Management algorithm

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tc</b>  <b>qdisc</b>  <b>...</b>  <b>codel</b>  [ <b>limit</b> PACKETS ] [ <b>target</b> TIME ] [ <b>interval</b> TIME ] [ <b>ecn</b> | <b>noecn</b> ] [ <b>ce_threshold</b>
       TIME ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       CoDel (pronounced "coddle") is an adaptive "no-knobs" active queue management algorithm (AQM) scheme that
       was developed to address the shortcomings of RED and its variants. It was developed  with  the  following
       goals in mind:

       *   It should be parameterless.

       *   It should keep delays low while permitting bursts of traffic.

       *   It should control delay.

       *   It should adapt dynamically to changing link rates with no impact on utilization.

       *   It should be simple and efficient and should scale from simple to complex routers.

</pre><h4><b>ALGORITHM</b></h4><pre>
       CoDel comes with three major innovations. Instead of using queue size or queue average, it uses the local
       minimum  queue  as  a  measure of the standing/persistent queue.  Second, it uses a single state-tracking
       variable of the minimum delay to see where it is relative to the standing queue delay. Third, instead  of
       measuring queue size in bytes or packets, it is measured in packet-sojourn time in the queue.

       CoDel  measures the minimum local queue delay (i.e. standing queue delay) and compares it to the value of
       the given acceptable queue delay <b>target.</b>  As long as the minimum queue delay is less than <b>target</b>  or  the
       buffer  contains  fewer  than  MTU worth of bytes, packets are not dropped.  Codel enters a dropping mode
       when the minimum queue delay has exceeded <b>target</b> for a time greater than <b>interval.</b>  In this mode, packets
       are dropped at different drop times which is set by a control law.  The  control  law  ensures  that  the
       packet  drops  cause a linear change in the throughput. Once the minimum delay goes below <b>target,</b> packets
       are no longer dropped.

       Additional details can be found in the paper cited below.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>limit</b>
       is the hard limit on the real queue size. When this limit is reached, incoming packets  are  dropped.  If
       the value is lowered, packets are dropped so that the new limit is met. Default is 1000 packets.

   <b>target</b>
       is  the  acceptable minimum standing/persistent queue delay. This minimum delay is identified by tracking
       the local minimum queue delay that packets experience.  Default and recommended value is 5ms.

   <b>interval</b>
       is used to ensure that the measured minimum delay does not become too stale. The minimum  delay  must  be
       experienced  in  the  last epoch of length <b>interval.</b>  It should be set on the order of the worst-case RTT
       through the bottleneck to give endpoints sufficient time to react. Default value is 100ms.

   <b>ecn</b> <b>|</b> <b>noecn</b>
       can be used to mark packets instead of dropping them. If <b>ecn</b> has been enabled, <b>noecn</b> can be used to  turn
       it off and vice-a-versa. By default, <b>ecn</b> is turned off.

   <b>ce_threshold</b>
       sets  a  threshold above which all packets are marked with ECN Congestion Experienced. This is useful for
       DCTCP-style congestion control algorithms that require marking at very shallow queueing thresholds.
