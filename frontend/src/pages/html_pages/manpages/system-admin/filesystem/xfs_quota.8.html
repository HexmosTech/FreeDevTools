       xfs_quota - manage use of quota on XFS filesystems

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xfs_quota</b>  [  <b>-x</b>  ]  [  <b>-f</b>  ]  [  <b>-p</b>  <u>prog</u>  ] [ <b>-c</b> <u>cmd</u> ] ... [ <b>-d</b> <u>project</u> ] ... [ <b>-D</b> <u>projects_file</u> ] [ <b>-P</b>
       <u>projid_file</u> ] [ <u>path</u> ... ]
       <b>xfs_quota</b> <b>-V</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xfs_quota</b> is a utility for reporting and editing various aspects of filesystem quota.

       The options to <b>xfs_quota</b> are:

       <b>-c</b> <u>cmd</u>    <b>xfs_quota</b> commands may be run interactively (the default) or as arguments on the command  line.
                 Multiple  <b>-c</b>  arguments  may  be  given.   The commands are run in the sequence given, then the
                 program exits.

       <b>-p</b> <u>prog</u>   Set the program name for prompts and some error messages, the default value is <b>xfs_quota</b>.

       <b>-x</b>        Enable expert mode.  All of the administrative commands (see the ADMINISTRATOR COMMANDS section
                 below) which allow modifications to the quota system are available only in expert mode.

       <b>-f</b>        Enable foreign filesystem mode.  A limited number  of  user  and  administrative  commands  are
                 available for use on some foreign (non-XFS) filesystems.

       <b>-d</b> <u>project</u>
                 Project  names  or  numeric  identifiers may be specified with this option, which restricts the
                 output of the individual <b>xfs_quota</b> commands to the  set  of  projects  specified.  Multiple  <b>-d</b>
                 arguments may be given.

       <b>-D</b> <u>projects_file</u>
                 Specify  a  file  containing  the  mapping  of  numeric project identifiers to directory trees.
                 <u>/etc/projects</u> as default, if this option is none.

       <b>-P</b> <u>projid_file</u>
                 Specify a file containing  the  mapping  of  numeric  project  identifiers  to  project  names.
                 <u>/etc/projid</u> as default, if this option is none.

       <b>-V</b>        Prints the version number and exits.

       The  optional  <u>path</u>  argument(s)  can  be used to specify mount points or device files which identify XFS
       filesystems. The output of the individual <b>xfs_quota</b> commands will  then  be  restricted  to  the  set  of
       filesystems specified.

       This  manual page is divided into two sections - firstly, information for users of filesystems with quota
       enabled, and the <b>xfs_quota</b> commands of interest to such users; and then information which is useful  only
       to  administrators of XFS filesystems using quota and the quota commands which allow modifications to the
       quota system.

       Note that common to almost all of the individual commands described below are the options for  specifying
       which  quota types are of interest - user quota (<b>-u</b>), group quota (<b>-g</b>), and/or project quota (<b>-p</b>).  Also,
       several commands provide options to operate on "blocks used" (<b>-b</b>), "inodes used" (<b>-i</b>),  and/or  "realtime
       blocks used" (<b>-r</b>).

       Many commands also have extensive online help. Use the <b>help</b> command for more details on any command.

</pre><h4><b>QUOTA</b> <b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       In  most computing environments, disk space is not infinite.  The quota subsystem provides a mechanism to
       control usage of disk space.  Quotas can be set  for  each  individual  user  on  any/all  of  the  local
       filesystems.   The  quota  subsystem  warns  users when they exceed their allotted limit, but allows some
       extra space for  current  work  (hard  limit/soft  limit).   In  addition,  XFS  filesystems  with  limit
       enforcement turned off can be used as an effective disk usage accounting system.

   <b>Users'</b> <b>View</b> <b>of</b> <b>Disk</b> <b>Quotas</b>
       To  most users, disk quotas are either of no concern or a fact of life that cannot be avoided.  There are
       two possible quotas that can be imposed - a limit can be set on the amount of space a  user  can  occupy,
       and there may be a limit on the number of files (inodes) they can own.

       The  <b>quota</b> command provides information on the quotas that have been set by the system administrators and
       current usage.

       There are four numbers for each limit:  current usage, soft limit (quota), hard limit,  and  time  limit.
       The soft limit is the number of 1K-blocks (or files) that the user is expected to remain below.  The hard
       limit  cannot  be  exceeded.   If  a  user's usage reaches the hard limit, further requests for space (or
       attempts to create a file) fail with the "Quota exceeded" (EDQUOT) error.

       When a user exceeds the soft limit, the timer is enabled.  Any  time  the  quota  drops  below  the  soft
       limits, the timer is disabled.  If the timer pops, the particular limit that has been exceeded is treated
       as  if the hard limit has been reached, and no more resources are allocated to the user.  The only way to
       reset this condition, short of turning off limit enforcement or increasing the limit, is to reduce  usage
       below  quota.   Only the superuser (i.e. a sufficiently capable process) can set the time limits and this
       is done on a per filesystem basis.

   <b>Surviving</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Quota</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Reached</b>
       In most cases, the only way for a user to  recover  from  over-quota  conditions  is  to  abort  whatever
       activity  is  in  progress on the filesystem that has reached its limit, remove sufficient files to bring
       the limit back below quota, and retry the failed program.
       However, if a user is in the editor and a write fails because of an over quota situation, that is  not  a
       suitable  course  of action.  It is most likely that initially attempting to write the file has truncated
       its previous contents, so if the editor is aborted without correctly writing the file, not only  are  the
       recent changes lost, but possibly much, or even all, of the contents that previously existed.
       There are several possible safe exits for a user caught in this situation.  They can use the editor shell
       escape  command  to  examine their file space and remove surplus files.  Alternatively, using <b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1), they
       can suspend the editor, remove some files, then resume it.  A third possibility is to write the  file  to
       some  other  filesystem  (perhaps  to a file on <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>) where the user's quota has not been exceeded.  Then
       after rectifying the quota situation, the file can be moved back to the filesystem it belongs on.

   <b>Default</b> <b>Quotas</b>
       The XFS quota subsystem allows a default quota to be enforced for any user, group or project  which  does
       not  have  a  quota  limit  explicitly  set.   These limits are stored in and displayed as ID 0's limits,
       although they do not actually limit ID 0.

</pre><h4><b>USER</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>print</b>  Lists all paths with devices/project identifiers.  The path list can come from  several  places  -
              the command line, the mount table, and the <u>/etc/projects</u> file.

       <b>df</b>     See the <b>free</b> command.

       <b>quota</b> [ <b>-g</b> | <b>-p</b> | <b>-u</b> ] [ <b>-bir</b> ] [ <b>-hnNv</b> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>file</u> ] [ <u>ID</u> | <u>name</u> ] ...
              Show  individual  usage  and  limits,  for  a  single user <u>name</u> or numeric user <u>ID</u>.  The <b>-h</b> option
              reports in a "human-readable" format similar to the <b><a href="../man1/df.1.html">df</a></b>(1)  command.  The  <b>-n</b>  option  reports  the
              numeric  IDs  rather  than the name. The <b>-N</b> option omits the header. The <b>-v</b> option outputs verbose
              information. The <b>-f</b> option sends the output to <u>file</u> instead of stdout.

       <b>free</b> [ <b>-bir</b> ] [ <b>-hN</b> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>file</u> ]
              Reports filesystem usage, much like the <b><a href="../man1/df.1.html">df</a></b>(1) utility.  It  can  show  usage  for  <b>b</b>locks,  <b>i</b>node,
              and/or  <b>r</b>ealtime  block space, and shows used, free, and total available.  If project quota are in
              use (see the DIRECTORY TREE QUOTA section below),  it  will  also  report  utilisation  for  those
              projects  (directory  trees).  The  <b>-h</b>  option reports in a "human-readable" format. The <b>-N</b> option
              omits the header. The <b>-f</b> option outputs the report to <u>file</u> instead of stdout.

       <b>help</b> [ <u>command</u> ]
              Online help for all commands, or one specific <u>command</u>.

       <b>quit</b>   Exit <b>xfs_quota</b>.

       <b>q</b>      See the <b>quit</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>QUOTA</b> <b>ADMINISTRATION</b></h4><pre>
       The XFS quota system differs to that of other filesystems in a number of  ways.   Most  importantly,  XFS
       considers  quota  information  as  filesystem  metadata  and  uses  journaling  to provide a higher level
       guarantee of consistency.  As such, it is administered differently, in particular:

       1.     The <b>quotacheck</b> command has no effect on XFS filesystems.   The  first  time  quota  accounting  is
              turned  on  (at  mount  time),  XFS does an automatic quotacheck internally; afterwards, the quota
              system will always be completely consistent until quotas are manually turned off.

       2.     There is no need for quota file(s) in the root of the XFS filesystem.

       3.     XFS distinguishes between quota accounting and limit enforcement.  Quota accounting must be turned
              on at the time of mounting the XFS filesystem.  However, it  is  possible  to  turn  on/off  limit
              enforcement any time quota accounting is turned on.  The "quota" option to the <b>mount</b> command turns
              on both (user) quota accounting and enforcement.  The "uqnoenforce" option must be used to turn on
              user accounting with limit enforcement disabled.

       4.     Turning on quotas on the root filesystem is slightly different from the above.  For Linux XFS, the
              quota mount flags must be passed in with the "rootflags=" boot parameter.

       5.     It  is  useful  to  use the <b>state</b> to monitor the XFS quota subsystem at various stages - it can be
              used to see if quotas are turned on, and also to monitor the space occupied by  the  quota  system
              itself..

       6.     There  is  a  mechanism built into <b>xfsdump</b> that allows quota limit information to be backed up for
              later restoration, should the need arise.

       7.     Quota limits cannot be set before turning on quotas on.

       8.     XFS filesystems keep quota accounting on the superuser (user ID zero), and the tool  will  display
              the  superuser's  usage information.  However, limits are never enforced on the superuser (nor are
              they enforced for group and project ID zero).

       9.     XFS filesystems perform quota accounting whether the user has quota limits or not.

       10.    XFS supports the notion of project quota, which can be used to implement a form of directory  tree
              quota  (i.e.  to  restrict  a  directory  tree  to  only  being  able to use up a component of the
              filesystems available space; or simply to keep track of the amount of space  used,  or  number  of
              inodes, within the tree).

</pre><h4><b>ADMINISTRATOR</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>path</b> [ <u>N</u> ]
              Lists  all  paths  with  devices/project identifiers or set the current path to the <u>N</u>th list entry
              (the current path is used by many of the commands described here,  it  identifies  the  filesystem
              toward  which  a  command  is directed).  The path list can come from several places - the command
              line, the mount table, and the <u>/etc/projects</u> file.

       <b>report</b> [ <b>-gpu</b> ] [ <b>-bir</b> ] [ <b>-ahntlLNU</b> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>file</u> ]
              Report filesystem quota information.  This reports all quota  usage  for  a  filesystem,  for  the
              specified  quota  type  (<b>u</b>/<b>g</b>/<b>p</b>  and/or <b>b</b>locks/<b>i</b>nodes/<b>r</b>ealtime).  It reports blocks in 1KB units by
              default. The <b>-h</b> option reports in a "human-readable" format similar to the <b><a href="../man1/df.1.html">df</a></b>(1) command.  The  <b>-f</b>
              option  outputs the report to <u>file</u> instead of stdout. The <b>-a</b> option reports on all filesystems. By
              default, outputs the name of the user/group/project. If no name is defined for a given ID, outputs
              the numeric ID instead. The <b>-n</b> option outputs the numeric ID instead of the name. The  <b>-L</b>  and  <b>-U</b>
              options  specify  lower and/or upper ID bounds to report on.  If upper/lower bounds are specified,
              then by default only the IDs will be displayed in output; with the <b>-l</b> option,  a  lookup  will  be
              performed  to  translate  these IDs to names. The <b>-N</b> option reports information without the header
              line. The <b>-t</b> option performs a terse report.

       <b>state</b> [ <b>-gpu</b> ] [ <b>-av</b> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>file</u> ]
              Report overall quota state information.  This reports on the  state  of  quota  accounting,  quota
              enforcement,  and the number of extents being used by quota metadata within the filesystem. The <b>-f</b>
              option outputs state information to <u>file</u> instead of stdout. The <b>-a</b> option  reports  state  on  all
              filesystems and not just the current path.

       <b>limit</b> [ <b>-g</b> | <b>-p</b> | <b>-u</b> ] <b>bsoft=</b><u>N</u> | <b>bhard=</b><u>N</u> | <b>isoft=</b><u>N</u> | <b>ihard=</b><u>N</u> | <b>rtbsoft=</b><u>N</u> | <b>rtbhard=</b><u>N</u> <b>-d</b> | <u>id</u> | <u>name</u>
              Set  quota  block  limits  (bhard/bsoft),  inode  count limits (ihard/isoft) and/or realtime block
              limits (rtbhard/rtbsoft) to N, where N is a  number  representing  bytes  or  inodes.   For  block
              limits,  a number with a s/b/k/m/g/t/p/e multiplication suffix as described in <b><a href="../man8/mkfs.xfs.8.html">mkfs.xfs</a></b>(8) is also
              accepted.  For inode limits, no suffixes are allowed.  The <b>-d</b> option (defaults) can be used to set
              the default value that will be used, otherwise  a  specific  <b>u</b>ser/<b>g</b>roup/<b>p</b>roject  <u>name</u>  or  numeric
              <u>id</u>entifier must be specified.

       <b>timer</b> [ <b>-g</b> | <b>-p</b> | <b>-u</b> ] [ <b>-bir</b> ] <u>value</u> [ <b>-d</b> | <u>id</u> | <u>name</u> ]
              Allows  the  quota  enforcement  timeout  (i.e. the amount of time allowed to pass before the soft
              limits are enforced as the hard limits) to  be  modified.  The  current  timeout  setting  can  be
              displayed using the <b>state</b> command.
              When  setting  the  default timer via the <b>-d</b> option, or for <b>id</b> 0, or if no argument is given after
              <u>value</u> the <u>value</u> argument is a number of seconds indicating the relative amount of time after  soft
              limits are exceeded, before hard limits are enforced.
              When  setting  any  other  individual timer by <u>id</u> or <u>name,</u> the <u>value</u> is the number of seconds from
              now, at which time the hard limits will be enforced.  This allows extending the grace time  of  an
              individual user who has exceeded soft limits.
              For  <u>value,</u>  units  of  'minutes',  'hours', 'days', and 'weeks' are also understood (as are their
              abbreviations 'm', 'h', 'd', and 'w').

       <b>warn</b> [ <b>-g</b> | <b>-p</b> | <b>-u</b> ] [ <b>-bir</b> ] <u>value</u> <b>-d</b> | <u>id</u> | <u>name</u>
              Allows the quota warnings limit (i.e. the number of times a warning will be send to  someone  over
              quota)  to  be  viewed  and modified. The <b>-d</b> option (defaults) can be used to set the default time
              that will be used, otherwise a specific <b>u</b>ser/<b>g</b>roup/<b>p</b>roject <u>name</u>  or  numeric  <u>id</u>entifier  must  be
              specified.  <b>NOTE:</b> <b>this</b> <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>currently</b> <b>implemented.</b>

       <b>enable</b> [ <b>-gpu</b> ] [ <b>-v</b> ]
              Switches  on  quota  enforcement for the filesystem identified by the current path.  This requires
              the filesystem to have been mounted with quota enabled, and for accounting to be currently active.
              The <b>-v</b> option (verbose) displays the state after the operation has completed.

       <b>disable</b> [ <b>-gpu</b> ] [ <b>-v</b> ]
              Disables quota enforcement, while  leaving  quota  accounting  active.  The  <b>-v</b>  option  (verbose)
              displays the state after the operation has completed.

       <b>off</b> [ <b>-gpu</b> ] [ <b>-v</b> ]
              Permanently  switches quota off for the filesystem identified by the current path.  Quota can only
              be switched back on subsequently by unmounting and then mounting again.

       <b>remove</b> [ <b>-gpu</b> ] [ <b>-v</b> ]
              Remove any space allocated to quota metadata from the filesystem identified by the  current  path.
              Quota must not be enabled on the filesystem, else this operation will report an error.

       <b>dump</b> [ <b>-g</b> | <b>-p</b> | <b>-u</b> ] [ <b>-L</b> | <b>-U</b> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>file</u> ]
              Dump out quota limit information for backup utilities, either to standard output (default) or to a
              <u>file</u>.   The  <b>-L</b>  and  <b>-U</b>  options  specify lower and/or upper ID bounds to dump.  This is only the
              limits, not the usage information, of course.

       <b>restore</b> [ <b>-g</b> | <b>-p</b> | <b>-u</b> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>file</u> ]
              Restore quota limits from a backup <u>file</u>.  The file must be in the  format  produced  by  the  <b>dump</b>
              command.

       <b>quot</b> [ <b>-g</b> | <b>-p</b> | <b>-u</b> ] [ <b>-bir</b> ] [ <b>-acnv</b> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>file</u> ]
              Summarize  filesystem  ownership,  by  user,  group  or  project.  This command uses a special XFS
              "bulkstat" interface to quickly scan an entire filesystem  and  report  usage  information.   This
              command  can  be  used even when filesystem quota are not enabled, as it is a full-filesystem scan
              (it may also take a long time...). The <b>-a</b> option displays information on all filesystems.  The  <b>-c</b>
              option  displays  a  histogram instead of a report. The <b>-n</b> option displays numeric IDs rather than
              names. The <b>-v</b> option displays verbose information. The <b>-f</b> option send the output to  <u>file</u>  instead
              of stdout.

       <b>project</b> [ <b>-cCs</b> [ <b>-d</b> <u>depth</u> ] [ <b>-p</b> <u>path</u> ] <u>id</u> | <u>name</u> ]
              The  <b>-c</b>,  <b>-C</b>, and <b>-s</b> options allow the directory tree quota mechanism to be maintained.  <b>-d</b> allows
              one to limit recursion level when processing project directories and  <b>-p</b>  allows  one  to  specify
              project  paths  at  command line ( instead of <u>/etc/projects</u> ). All options are discussed in detail
              below.

</pre><h4><b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>TREE</b> <b>QUOTA</b></h4><pre>
       The project quota mechanism in XFS can be used to implement a form  of  directory  tree  quota,  where  a
       specified  directory  and all of the files and subdirectories below it (i.e. a tree) can be restricted to
       using a subset of the available space in the filesystem.

       A managed tree must be setup initially using the <b>-s</b> option to the <b>project</b> command. The specified  project
       name  or  identifier  is  matched to one or more trees defined in <u>/etc/projects</u>, and these trees are then
       recursively descended to mark the affected inodes as being part of that tree.  This process sets an inode
       flag and the project identifier on every file in the affected tree.  Once this has been done,  new  files
       created  in  the  tree will automatically be accounted to the tree based on their project identifier.  An
       attempt to create a hard link to a file in the tree will only succeed if the project  identifier  matches
       the  project  identifier  for  the  tree.   The  <b>xfs_io</b>  utility can be used to set the project ID for an
       arbitrary file, but this can only be done by a privileged user.

       A previously setup tree can be cleared from project quota control through use of the <b>project</b>  <b>-C</b>  option,
       which will recursively descend the tree, clearing the affected inodes from project quota control.

       Finally,  the  <b>project</b>  <b>-c</b> option can be used to check whether a tree is setup, it reports nothing if the
       tree is correct, otherwise it reports the paths of inodes which do not have the project ID of the rest of
       the tree, or if the inode flag is not set.

       Option <b>-d</b> can be used to limit recursion level (-1 is infinite, 0 is top level only, 1 is first level ...
       ).  Option <b>-p</b> adds possibility to specify project paths in command line without a need for  <u>/etc/projects</u>
       to exist. Note that if projects file exists then it is also used.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Enabling quota enforcement on an XFS filesystem (restrict a user to a set amount of space).

            # mount -o uquota /dev/xvm/home <a href="file:/home">/home</a>
            # xfs_quota -x -c 'limit bsoft=500m bhard=550m tanya' <a href="file:/home">/home</a>
            # xfs_quota -x -c report <a href="file:/home">/home</a>

       Enabling  project  quota  on  an  XFS  filesystem (restrict files in log file directories to only using 1
       gigabyte of space).

            # mount -o prjquota /dev/xvm/var <a href="file:/var">/var</a>
            # echo 42:<a href="file:/var/log">/var/log</a> &gt;&gt; /etc/projects
            # echo logfiles:42 &gt;&gt; /etc/projid
            # xfs_quota -x -c 'project -s logfiles' <a href="file:/var">/var</a>
            # xfs_quota -x -c 'limit -p bhard=1g logfiles' <a href="file:/var">/var</a>

       Same as above without a need for configuration files.

            # rm -f /etc/projects /etc/projid
            # mount -o prjquota /dev/xvm/var <a href="file:/var">/var</a>
            # xfs_quota -x -c 'project -s -p <a href="file:/var/log">/var/log</a> 42' <a href="file:/var">/var</a>
            # xfs_quota -x -c 'limit -p bhard=1g 42' <a href="file:/var">/var</a>

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The XFS allocation mechanism will always reserve the maximum amount of space required  before  proceeding
       with  an  allocation.   If  insufficient  space for this reservation is available, due to the block quota
       limit being reached for example, this  may  result  in  the  allocation  failing  even  though  there  is
       sufficient  space.   Quota  enforcement  can  thus sometimes happen in situations where the user is under
       quota and the end result of some operation would still have left the user under quota had  the  operation
       been allowed to run its course.  This additional overhead is typically in the range of tens of blocks.

       Both  of these properties are unavoidable side effects of the way XFS operates, so should be kept in mind
       when assigning block limits.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Quota support for filesystems with realtime subvolumes is not yet implemented, nor is the  quota  warning
       mechanism (the Linux <b><a href="../man8/warnquota.8.html">warnquota</a></b>(8) tool can be used to provide similar functionality on that platform).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/projects</u>       Mapping of numeric project identifiers to directories trees.
       <u>/etc/projid</u>         Mapping of numeric project identifiers to project names.
