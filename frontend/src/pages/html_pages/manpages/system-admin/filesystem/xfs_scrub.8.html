       xfs_scrub - check and repair the contents of a mounted XFS filesystem

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xfs_scrub</b> [ <b>-abCeMmnpTvx</b> ] <u>mount-point</u>
       <b>xfs_scrub</b> <b>-V</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xfs_scrub</b> attempts to check and repair all metadata in a mounted XFS filesystem.

       <b>WARNING!</b>   This  program is <b>EXPERIMENTAL</b>, which means that its behavior and interface could change at any
       time!

       <b>xfs_scrub</b> asks the kernel to scrub all metadata objects in the filesystem.  Metadata records are  scanned
       for  obviously  bad  values and then cross-referenced against other metadata.  The goal is to establish a
       reasonable confidence about the consistency of the overall filesystem by  examining  the  consistency  of
       individual  metadata  records  against  the  other  metadata  in the filesystem.  Damaged metadata can be
       rebuilt from other metadata if there exists redundant data structures which are intact.

       Filesystem corruption and optimization opportunities  will  be  logged  to  the  standard  error  stream.
       Enabling verbose mode will increase the amount of status information sent to the output.

       If the kernel scrub reports that metadata needs repairs or optimizations and the user does not pass <b>-n</b> on
       the  command line, this program will ask the kernel to make the repairs and to perform the optimizations.
       See the sections about optimizations and repairs for a list of optimizations and repairs  known  to  this
       program.   The  kernel  may not support repairing or optimizing the filesystem.  If this is the case, the
       filesystem must be unmounted and <b><a href="../man8/xfs_repair.8.html">xfs_repair</a></b>(8) run on the filesystem to fix the problems.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b> <u>errors</u>
              Abort if more than this many errors are found on the filesystem.

       <b>-b</b>     Run in background mode.  If the option is specified once, only run a single scrubbing thread at  a
              time.  If given more than once, an artificial delay of 100us is added to each scrub call to reduce
              CPU overhead even further.

       <b>-C</b> <u>fd</u>  This  option  causes  xfs_scrub to write progress information to the specified file description so
              that the progress of the filesystem check can be monitored.  If the file description is a  tty,  a
              fancy  progress bar is rendered.  Otherwise, a simple numeric status dump compatible with the <b>fsck</b>
              <b>-C</b> format is output.

       <b>-e</b>     Specifies what happens when errors are detected.  If <u>shutdown</u> is given,  the  filesystem  will  be
              taken  offline if errors are found.  If <u>continue</u> is given, no action is taken if errors are found;
              this is the default behavior.

       <b>-k</b>     Do not call TRIM on the free space.

       <b>-M</b> <u>real-mount-point</u>
              Open the this path for issuing scrub system calls  to  the  kernel.   The  positional  <u>mount-point</u>
              parameter  will  be used for displaying informational messages and logging.  This parameter exists
              to enable process sandboxing for service mode.

       <b>-m</b> <u>file</u>
              Search this file for mounted filesystems instead of /etc/mtab.

       <b>-n</b>     Only check filesystem metadata.  Do not repair or optimize anything.

       <b>-o</b> <u>subopt</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>] Override what the program might conclude about  the  filesystem  if  left  to  its  own
              devices.

              The <u>subopt</u>ions supported are:

                 <b>autofsck</b>
                        Decide  the  operating mode from the value of the <u>autofsck</u> filesystem property.  See the
                        <b>filesystem</b> <b>properties</b> section for more details.

                 <b>fstrim_pct=</b><u>percentage</u>
                        To constrain the amount of time spent on fstrim activities during phase 8, this  program
                        tries  to  balance  estimated  runtime  against completeness of the trim.  In short, the
                        program avoids small trim requests to save time.

                        During phase 7, a log-scale histogram of free space  extents  is  constructed.   At  the
                        start  of  phase  8,  a  CDF  is  computed in decreasing order of extent length from the
                        histogram buckets.  A point corresponding to the fstrim percentage target is chosen from
                        the CDF and mapped back to a histogram bucket.  Free space extents at least as  long  as
                        the bucket size are trimmed.  Smaller extents are ignored.

                        By default, the percentage threshold is 99%.

                 <b>iwarn</b>  Treat  informational  messages  as warnings.  This will result in a nonzero return code,
                        and a higher logging level.

       <b>-p</b>     Only optimize filesystem metadata.  If repairs are required, report them and exit.

       <b>-T</b>     Print timing and memory usage information for each phase.

       <b>-v</b>     Enable verbose mode, which prints periodic status updates.

       <b>-V</b>     Prints the version number and exits.

       <b>-x</b>     Read all file data extents to look for disk errors.  <b>xfs_scrub</b> will issue O_DIRECT  reads  to  the
              block  device  directly.   If  the  block device is a SCSI disk, it will instead issue READ VERIFY
              commands directly to the disk.  If media errors are found, the error report will include the  disk
              offset,  in  bytes.   If  the  media  errors affect a file, the report will also include the inode
              number and file offset, in bytes.  These actions will confirm that all file  data  blocks  can  be
              read from storage.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIMIZATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Optimizations supported by this program include, but are not limited to:

       • Instructing the underlying storage to discard unused extents via the <b>TRIM</b> ioctl.

       • Updating secondary superblocks to match the primary superblock.

       • Turning off shared block write checks for files that no longer share blocks.

</pre><h4><b>REPAIRS</b></h4><pre>
       Repairs  are  performed  by  calling  into  the  kernel.   This  limits the scope of repair activities to
       rebuilding primary data structures from secondary data structures, or secondary structures  from  primary
       structures.   The  existence of secondary data structures may require features that can only be turned on
       from <b><a href="../man8/mkfs.xfs.8.html">mkfs.xfs</a></b>(8).  If errors cannot be repaired, the filesystem must be unmounted and <b><a href="../man8/xfs_repair.8.html">xfs_repair</a></b>(8)  run.
       Repairs supported by the kernel include, but are not limited to:

       • Reconstructing extent allocation data.

       • Rebuilding free space information.

       • Rebuilding inode indexes.

       • Fixing minor corruptions of inode records.

       • Recalculating reference count information.

       • Reconstructing reverse mapping data from primary extent allocation data.

       • Scheduling a quotacheck for the next mount.

       If  corrupt  metadata is successfully repaired, this program will log that a repair has succeeded instead
       of a corruption report.

</pre><h4><b>FILESYSTEM</b> <b>PROPERTIES</b></h4><pre>
       System administrators can convey their preferences for scrubbing of a particular  filesystem  by  setting
       the  filesystem  property  <b>autofsck</b> via the <b><a href="../man8/xfs_property.8.html">xfs_property</a></b>(8) command on the filesystem.  These preferences
       will be honored if the <b>-o</b> <b>autofsck</b> option is specified.

       Recognized values for the <b>autofsck</b> property are:

              <u>none</u>   Do not scan the filesystem at all.

              <u>check</u>  Scan and report corruption and opportunities for optimization, but do not change anything.

              <u>optimize</u>
                     Scan the filesystem and optimize where possible.  Report corruptions, but do not fix them.

              <u>repair</u> Scan the filesystem, fix corruptions, and optimize where possible.

       If the property is not set, the default is <u>check</u> if the filesystem has either reverse mapping  btrees  or
       parent pointers enabled, or <u>none</u> otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODE</b></h4><pre>
       The exit code returned by <b>xfs_scrub</b> is the sum of the following conditions:
            0    - No errors
            1    - File system errors left uncorrected
            2    - File system optimizations possible
            4    - Operational error
            8    - Usage or syntax error

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xfs_scrub</b>  is  an  immature utility!  Do not run this program unless you have backups of your data!  This
       program takes advantage of in-kernel scrubbing to verify a given data structure with locks held  and  can
       keep  the  filesystem  busy for a long time.  The kernel must be new enough to support the SCRUB_METADATA
       ioctl.

       If errors are found and cannot be repaired, the filesystem must be unmounted and repaired.
