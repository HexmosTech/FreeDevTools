</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xfsrestore - XFS filesystem incremental restore utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xfsrestore</b> -h
       <b>xfsrestore</b> [ options ] -f <u>source</u> [ -f <u>source</u> ... ] <u>dest</u>
       <b>xfsrestore</b> [ options ] - <u>dest</u>
       <b>xfsrestore</b> -I [ subopt=value ... ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xfsrestore</u> restores filesystems from dumps produced by <u><a href="../man8/xfsdump.8.html">xfsdump</a></u>(8).  Two modes of operation are available:
       simple and cumulative.

       The  default  is  simple  mode.  <u>xfsrestore</u> populates the specified destination directory, <u>dest</u>, with the
       files contained in the dump media.

       The <b>-r</b> option specifies the cumulative mode.  Successive invocations of <u>xfsrestore</u> are used  to  apply  a
       chronologically ordered sequence of delta dumps to a base (level 0) dump.  The contents of the filesystem
       at  the time each dump was produced is reproduced.  This can involve adding, deleting, renaming, linking,
       and unlinking files and directories.

       A delta dump is defined as either an incremental dump (<u>xfsdump</u> <b>-l</b> option with level &gt;  0)  or  a  resumed
       dump  (<u>xfsdump</u>  <b>-R</b>  option).   The  deltas  must  be applied in the order they were produced.  Each delta
       applied must have been produced with the previously applied delta as its base.

       <u>xfsrestore</u> keeps state information in the <u>xfsrestorehousekeepingdir</u>,  to  inform  subsequent  invocations
       when  used  in  cumulative  mode,  or  in  the  event a restore is interrupted.  To ensure that the state
       information can be processed, a compatible version  of  <u>xfsrestore</u>  must  be  used  for  each  subsequent
       invocation. Additionally, each invocation must run on a system of the same endianness and page size.

       The options to <u>xfsrestore</u> are:

       <b>-a</b> <u>housekeeping</u>
            Each  invocation of <u>xfsrestore</u> creates a directory called <u>xfsrestorehousekeepingdir</u>.  This directory
            is normally created directly under the <u>dest</u> directory.  The <b>-a</b> option allows the operator to specify
            an alternate directory, <u>housekeeping</u>, in  which  <u>xfsrestore</u>  creates  the  <u>xfsrestorehousekeepingdir</u>
            directory.  When performing a cumulative (<b>-r</b> option) restore or resuming (<b>-R</b> option) a restore, each
            successive invocation must specify the same alternate directory.

       <b>-b</b> <u>blocksize</u>
            Specifies the blocksize, in bytes, to be used for the restore.  For other drives such as DAT or 8 mm
            ,  the  same  blocksize  used  for the xfsdump operation must be specified to restore the tape.  The
            default block size is 1Mb.

       <b>-c</b> <u>progname</u>
            Use the specified program to alert the operator when a media change is required. The  alert  program
            is typically a script to send a mail or flash a window to draw the operator's attention.

       <b>-e</b>   Prevents <u>xfsrestore</u> from overwriting existing files in the <u>dest</u> directory.

       <b>-f</b> <u>source</u> [ <b>-f</b> <u>source</u> ... ]
            Specifies a source of the dump to be restored.  This can be the pathname of a device (such as a tape
            drive),  a  regular  file  or  a remote tape drive (see <u><a href="../man8/rmt.8.html">rmt</a></u>(8)).  This option must be omitted if the
            standard input option (a lone <b>-</b> preceding the <u>dest</u> specification) is specified.

       <b>-i</b>   Selects interactive operation.  Once the on-media directory hierarchy has been read, an  interactive
            dialogue  is  begun.   The  operator uses a small set of commands to peruse the directory hierarchy,
            selecting files and subtrees for extraction.  The available commands  are  given  below.   Initially
            nothing is selected, except for those subtrees specified with <b>-s</b> command line options.

            <b>ls</b> [<u>arg</u>]       List  the  entries  in  the  current  directory  or  the  specified directory, or the
                           specified non-directory file entry.  Both the entry's original inode number and  name
                           are  displayed.   Entries that are directories are appended with a `/'.  Entries that
                           have been selected for extraction are prepended with a `*'.

            <b>cd</b> [<u>arg</u>]       Change the current working directory to the specified argument, or to the  filesystem
                           root directory if no argument is specified.

            <b>pwd</b>            Print the pathname of the current directory, relative to the filesystem root.

            <b>add</b> [<u>arg</u>]      The  current directory or specified file or directory within the current directory is
                           selected for  extraction.   If  a  directory  is  specified,  then  it  and  all  its
                           descendents  are  selected.   Entries  that are selected for extraction are prepended
                           with a `*' when they are listed by <b>ls</b>.

            <b>delete</b> [<u>arg</u>]   The current directory or specified file or directory within the current directory  is
                           deselected  for  extraction.   If  a  directory  is  specified,  then  it and all its
                           descendents are deselected.  The most expedient way to extract most of the files from
                           a directory is to select the directory and then deselect those  files  that  are  not
                           needed.

            <b>extract</b>        Ends the interactive dialogue, and causes all selected subtrees to be restored.

            <b>quit</b>           <u>xfsrestore</u>  ends  the  interactive  dialogue and immediately exits, even if there are
                           files or subtrees selected for extraction.

            <b>help</b>           List a summary of the available commands.

       <b>-m</b>   Use the minimal tape protocol.  This option cannot be used without specifying a blocksize to be used
            (see <b>-b</b> option above).

       <b>-n</b> <u>file</u>
            Allows <u>xfsrestore</u> to restore only files newer than <u>file</u>.  The modification time of  <u>file</u>  (i.e.,  as
            displayed  with  the  <b>ls</b>  <b>-l</b> command) is compared to the inode modification time of each file on the
            source media (i.e., as displayed with the <b>ls</b> <b>-lc</b> command).  A file is restored from  media  only  if
            its inode modification time is greater than or equal to the modification time of <u>file</u>.

       <b>-o</b>   Restore  file  and  directory  owner/group  even if not root.  When run with an effective user id of
            root, <u>xfsrestore</u> restores owner and group of each file and  directory.   When  run  with  any  other
            effective user id it does not, unless this option is specified.

       <b>-p</b> <u>interval</u>
            Causes  progress  reports  to  be  printed  at intervals of <u>interval</u> seconds.  The interval value is
            approximate, <u>xfsrestore</u> will delay progress reports to avoid undue processing overhead.

       <b>-q</b>   Source tape drive is a QIC tape.  QIC tapes only use a 512 byte blocksize, for which <u>xfsrestore</u> must
            make special allowances.

       <b>-r</b>   Selects the cumulative mode of operation. The <b>-a</b> and <u>destination</u> options must be the same  for  each
            invocation.

       <b>-s</b> <u>subtree</u>
            Specifies  a  subtree to restore.  Any number of <b>-s</b> options are allowed.  The restore is constrained
            to the union of all subtrees specified.  Each subtree is specified as a  pathname  relative  to  the
            restore  <u>dest</u>.   If a directory is specified, the directory and all files beneath that directory are
            restored.

       <b>-t</b>   Displays the contents of the dump, but does not create or modify any files or directories.   It  may
            be desirable to set the verbosity level to <b>silent</b> when using this option.

       <b>-x</b>   This  option  may  be  useful  to  fix  an issue which the files are restored to orphanage directory
            because of xfsdump (v3.1.7 - v3.1.9) problem.  A normal dump cannot be restored  with  this  option.
            This  option works only for a corrupted dump.  If a dump is created by problematic xfsdump (v3.1.7 -
            v3.1.9), you should see the contents of the dump with <b>-t</b> option before restoring. Then, if a file is
            placed to the orphanage directory, you need to use this <b>-x</b> option to restore  the  dump.  Otherwise,
            you can restore the dump without this option.

            In  the  cumulative mode, this option is required only for a base (level 0) dump. You no longer need
            this option for level 1+ dumps.

       <b>-v</b> <u>verbosity</u>
       <b>-v</b> <u>subsys</u>=<u>verbosity</u>[,<u>subsys</u>=<u>verbosity</u>,...]
            Specifies the level of detail used for messages displayed during the  course  of  the  restore.  The
            <u>verbosity</u>  argument  can  be  passed  as  either  a  string or an integer. If passed as a string the
            following values may be used: <b>silent</b>, <b>verbose</b>, <b>trace</b>, <b>debug</b>, or <b>nitty</b>.  If  passed  as  an  integer,
            values  from  0-5  may be used. The values 0-4 correspond to the strings already listed. The value 5
            can be used to produce even more verbose debug output.

            The first form of this option activates message logging across all restore  subsystems.  The  second
            form  allows  the message logging level to be controlled on a per-subsystem basis. The two forms can
            be combined (see the example below). The argument <u>subsys</u> can  take  one  of  the  following  values:
            <b>general</b>, <b>proc</b>, <b>drive</b>, <b>media</b>, <b>inventory</b>, and <b>tree</b>.

            For example, to restore the root filesystem with tracing activated for all subsystems:

                 <b>#</b> <b>xfsrestore</b> <b>-v</b> <b>trace</b> <b>-f</b> <b>/dev/tape</b> <b>/</b>

            To enable debug-level tracing for drive and media operations:

                 <b>#</b> <b>xfsrestore</b> <b>-v</b> <b>drive=debug,media=debug</b> <b>-f</b> <b>/dev/tape</b> <b>/</b>

            To enable tracing for all subsystems, and debug level tracing for drive operations only:

                 <b>#</b> <b>xfsrestore</b> <b>-v</b> <b>trace,drive=debug</b> <b>-f</b> <b>/dev/tape</b> <b>/</b>

       <b>-A</b>   Do  not  restore  extended  file  attributes.   When  restoring  a  filesystem  managed within a DMF
            environment this option should not be  used.  DMF  stores  file  migration  status  within  extended
            attributes  associated  with each file. If these attributes are not preserved when the filesystem is
            restored, files that had been in migrated state will not be recallable by DMF. Note that dumping  of
            extended file attributes is also optional.

       <b>-B</b>   Change  the  ownership  and  permissions  of  the  destination  directory to match those of the root
            directory of the dump.

       <b>-D</b>   Restore DMAPI (Data Management Application Programming Interface) event settings.  If  the  restored
            filesystem will be managed within the same DMF environment as the original dump it is essential that
            the -D option be used. Otherwise it is not usually desirable to restore these settings.

       <b>-E</b>   Prevents  <u>xfsrestore</u>  from  overwriting newer versions of files.  The inode modification time of the
            on-media file is compared to  the  inode  modification  time  of  corresponding  file  in  the  <u>dest</u>
            directory.   The file is restored only if the on-media version is newer than the version in the <u>dest</u>
            directory.  The inode modification time of a file can be displayed with the <b>ls</b> <b>-lc</b> command.

       <b>-F</b>   Inhibit interactive operator prompts.  This option inhibits <u>xfsrestore</u> from prompting  the  operator
            for verification of the selected dump as the restore target and from prompting for any media change.

       <b>-I</b>   Causes  the <u>xfsdump</u> inventory to be displayed (no restore is performed).  Each time <u>xfsdump</u> is used,
            an online inventory in <u>/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory</u> is updated.  This is used to  determine  the  base
            for  incremental  dumps.   It  is also useful for manually identifying a dump session to be restored
            (see the <b>-L</b> and <b>-S</b> options).  Suboptions to filter the inventory display are described later.

       <b>-J</b>   Inhibits inventory update when on-media session inventory encountered  during  restore.   <u>xfsrestore</u>
            opportunistically updates the online inventory when it encounters an on-media session inventory, but
            only if run with an effective user id of root and only if this option is not given.

       <b>-K</b>   Force  <u>xfsrestore</u>  to use dump format 2 generation numbers. Normally the need for this is determined
            automatically, but this option is required on the first <u>xfsrestore</u> invocation in the rare case  that
            a cumulative restore begins with a format 3 (or newer) dump and will be followed by a format 2 dump.

       <b>-L</b> <u>session_label</u>
            Specifies  the  label  of  the  dump  session to be restored.  The source media is searched for this
            label.  It is any arbitrary string up to 255 characters long.  The label of the desired dump session
            can be copied from the inventory display produced by the <b>-I</b> option.

       <b>-O</b> <u>options_file</u>
            Insert the options contained in <u>options_file</u> into the beginning of the command  line.   The  options
            are  specified  just  as  they  would  appear  if typed into the command line.  In addition, newline
            characters (\n) can be used as whitespace.  The options are placed before all options actually given
            on the command line, just after the command name.  Only one <b>-O</b> option can be used.  Recursive use is
            ignored.  The destination directory cannot be specified in <u>options_file</u>.

       <b>-Q</b>   Force completion of an interrupted restore session.  This option is  required  to  work  around  one
            specific  pathological  scenario.  When restoring a dump session which was interrupted due to an EOM
            condition and no online session inventory is available, <u>xfsrestore</u> cannot know when the  restore  of
            that  dump  session  is complete.  The operator is forced to interrupt the restore session.  In that
            case, if the operator tries to subsequently apply a resumed dump (using the <b>-r</b>  option),  <u>xfsrestore</u>
            refuses  to do so.  The operator must tell <u>xfsrestore</u> to consider the base restore complete by using
            this option when applying the resumed dump.

       <b>-R</b>   Resume a previously interrupted restore.  <u>xfsrestore</u> can be interrupted at any time by pressing  the
            terminal  interrupt  character  (see  <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1)).   Use this option to resume the restore.  The <b>-a</b> and
            <u>destination</u> options must be the same.

       <b>-S</b> <u>session_id</u>
            Specifies the session UUID of the dump session to be restored.  The source  media  is  searched  for
            this  UUID.   The UUID of the desired dump session can be copied from the inventory display produced
            by the <b>-I</b> option.

       <b>-T</b>   Inhibits interactive dialogue timeouts.  <u>xfsrestore</u> prompts the operator for  media  changes.   This
            dialogue normally times out if no response is supplied.  This option prevents the timeout.

       <b>-X</b> <u>subtree</u>
            Specifies  a  subtree  to exclude.  This is the converse of the <b>-s</b> option.  Any number of <b>-X</b> options
            are allowed.  Each subtree is specified as a pathname relative to the restore <u>dest</u>.  If a  directory
            is specified, the directory and all files beneath that directory are excluded.

       <b>-Y</b> <u>io_ring_length</u>
            Specify  I/O  buffer  ring  length.   <u>xfsrestore</u>  uses  a  ring  of input buffers to achieve maximum
            throughput when restoring from tape drives.  The default ring length is 3.   However,  this  is  not
            currently enabled on Linux yet, making this option benign.

       <b>-</b>    A  lone  <b>-</b>  causes the standard input to be read as the source of the dump to be restored.  Standard
            input can be a pipe from another utility (such as <u><a href="../man8/xfsdump.8.html">xfsdump</a></u>(8)) or a  redirected  file.   This  option
            cannot  be  used  with  the  <b>-f</b>  option.   The <b>-</b> must follow all other options, and precede the <u>dest</u>
            specification.

       The dumped filesystem is restored into the <u>dest</u> directory.   There  is  no  default;  the  <u>dest</u>  must  be
       specified.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Cumulative</b> <b>Restoration</b>
       A  base (level 0) dump and an ordered set of delta dumps can be sequentially restored, each on top of the
       previous, to reproduce the contents of the original filesystem at the time the last delta  was  produced.
       The operator invokes <u>xfsrestore</u> once for each dump.  The <b>-r</b> option must be specified.  The <u>dest</u> directory
       must be the same for all invocations.  Each invocation leaves a directory named <u>xfsrestorehousekeeping</u> in
       the  <u>dest</u>  directory  (however,  see the <b>-a</b> option above).  This directory contains the state information
       that must be communicated between invocations.  The operator must remove this directory  after  the  last
       delta has been applied.

       <u>xfsrestore</u>  also  generates  a  directory named <u>orphanage</u> in the <u>dest</u> directory.  <u>xfsrestore</u> removes this
       directory after completing a simple restore.  However, if <u>orphanage</u> is not  empty,  it  is  not  removed.
       This can happen if files present on the dump media are not referenced by any of the restored directories.
       The  <u>orphanage</u>  has  an  entry for each such file.  The entry name is the file's original inode number, a
       ".", and the file's generation count modulo 4096 (only the lower 12 bits  of  the  generation  count  are
       used).

       <u>xfsrestore</u>  does  not  remove  the  <u>orphanage</u> after cumulative restores.  Like the <u>xfsrestorehousekeeping</u>
       directory, the operator must remove it after applying all delta dumps.

   <b>Media</b> <b>Management</b>
       A dump consists of one or more media files contained on one or more media objects.  A media file contains
       all or a portion of the filesystem dump.  Large filesystems are broken up into multiple  media  files  to
       minimize the impact of media dropouts, and to accommodate media object boundaries (end-of-media).

       A  media  object  is  any  storage medium: a tape cartridge, a remote tape device (see <u><a href="../man8/rmt.8.html">rmt</a></u>(8)), a regular
       file, or the standard input (currently other removable media drives are not supported).  Tape  cartridges
       can  contain  multiple media files, which are typically separated by (in tape parlance) file marks.  If a
       dump spans multiple media objects, the restore must begin with the  media  object  containing  the  first
       media file dumped.  The operator is prompted when the next media object is needed.

       Media objects can contain more than one dump.  The operator can select the desired dump by specifying the
       dump  label (<b>-L</b> option), or by specifying the dump UUID (<b>-S</b> option).  If neither is specified, <u>xfsrestore</u>
       scans the entire media object, prompting the operator as each dump session is encountered.

       The inventory display (<b>-I</b> option) is useful for identifying the  media  objects  required.   It  is  also
       useful  for identifying a dump session.  The session UUID can be copied from the inventory display to the
       <b>-S</b> option argument to unambiguously identify a dump session to be restored.

       Dumps placed in regular files or the standard output do not span multiple  media  objects,  nor  do  they
       contain multiple dumps.

   <b>Inventory</b>
       Each  dump  session  updates  an  inventory database in <u>/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory</u>.  This database can be
       displayed by invoking <u>xfsrestore</u> with the <b>-I</b> option.  The display uses tabbed indentation to present  the
       inventory  hierarchically.  The first level is filesystem.  The second level is session.  The third level
       is media stream (currently only one stream is  supported).   The  fourth  level  lists  the  media  files
       sequentially composing the stream.

       The following suboptions are available to filter the display.

       <b>-I</b> <b>depth=</b><u>n</u>
            (where  <u>n</u>  is  1,  2,  or  3)  limits  the  hierarchical depth of the display. When <u>n</u> is 1, only the
            filesystem information from the inventory is displayed. When <u>n</u> is 2,  only  filesystem  and  session
            information  are  displayed.  When  <u>n</u>  is  3,  only  filesystem,  session and stream information are
            displayed.

       <b>-I</b> <b>level=</b><u>n</u>
            (where <u>n</u> is the dump level) limits the display to dumps of that particular dump level.

       The display may be restricted to media files contained in a specific media object.

       <b>-I</b> <b>mobjid=</b><u>value</u>
            (where <u>value</u> is a media ID) specifies the media object by its media ID.

       <b>-I</b> <b>mobjlabel=</b><u>value</u>
            (where <u>value</u> is a media label) specifies the media object by its media label.

       Similarly, the display can be restricted to a specific filesystem.

       <b>-I</b> <b>mnt=</b><u>mount_point</u>
            (that is, [hostname:]pathname), identifies the filesystem by mountpoint.  Specifying the hostname is
            optional, but may be useful in a clustered environment where more than one host can  be  responsible
            for dumping a filesystem.

       <b>-I</b> <b>fsid=</b><u>filesystem_id</u>
            identifies the filesystem by filesystem ID.

       <b>-I</b> <b>dev=</b><u>device_pathname</u>
            (that  is, [hostname:]device_pathname) identifies the filesystem by device.  As with the <b>mnt</b> filter,
            specifying the hostname is optional.

       More than one of these suboptions, separated by commas, may be specified at the same time  to  limit  the
       display  of  the inventory to those dumps of interest.  However, at most four suboptions can be specified
       at once: one to constrain the display hierarchy depth, one to constrain the dump level, one to  constrain
       the media object, and one to constrain the filesystem.

       For  example,  <b>-I</b>  <b>depth=1,mobjlabel="tape</b>  <b>1",mnt=host1:/test_mnt</b>  would  display  only  the  filesystem
       information (depth=1) for those filesystems that were mounted on <u>host1:/test_mnt</u> at the time of the dump,
       and only those filesystems dumped to the media object labeled "tape 1".

       Dump records may be removed (pruned) from the inventory using the <u>xfsinvutil</u> program.

       An additional media file is placed at the end  of  each  dump  stream.   This  media  file  contains  the
       inventory   information   for   the   current   dump   session.    If   the  online  inventory  files  in
       <u>/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory</u> are missing information for the  current  dump  session,  then  the  inventory
       information  in the media file is automatically added to the files in <u>/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory.</u>  If you
       wish to incorporate the inventory information from the media file without restoring any data, you may  do
       so using the <b>-t</b> option:

            <b>#</b> <b>xfsrestore</b> <b>-t</b> <b>-f</b> <b>/dev/tape</b>

       This  is  useful  to  rebuild the inventory database if it is ever lost or corrupted.  The only caveat is
       that <u>xfsrestore</u> needs to read through the entire dump in order to reach the inventory media  file.   This
       could become time consuming for dump sessions with large media files.

   <b>Media</b> <b>Errors</b>
       <u>xfsdump</u> is tolerant of media errors, but cannot do error correction.  If a media error occurs in the body
       of  a media file, the filesystem file represented at that point is lost.  The bad portion of the media is
       skipped, and the restoration resumes at the next filesystem file after the bad portion of the media.

       If a media error occurs in the beginning of the media file, the entire media  file  is  lost.   For  this
       reason,  large  dumps are broken into a number of reasonably sized media files.  The restore resumes with
       the next media file.

   <b>Quotas</b>
       When <u>xfsdump</u> dumps a filesystem with user quotas, it creates a file  in  the  root  of  the  dump  called
       <u>xfsdump_quotas</u>.   <u>xfsrestore</u>  can  restore this file like any other file included in the dump.  This file
       can be processed by the  restore  command  of  <u><a href="../man8/xfs_quota.8.html">xfs_quota</a></u>(8)  to  reactivate  the  quotas.   However,  the
       <u>xfsdump_quotas</u>  file  contains  information  which  may  first  require  modification;  specifically  the
       filesystem name and the user ids.  If you are restoring the  quotas  for  the  same  users  on  the  same
       filesystem  from  which  the dump was taken, then no modification will be necessary.  However, if you are
       restoring the dump to a different filesystem, you will need to:

       - ensure the new filesystem is mounted with the quota option

       - modify the <u>xfsdump_quotas</u> file to contain the new filesystem name

       - ensure the uids in the <u>xfsdump_quotas</u> file are correct

       Once the quota information has been verified, the restore command of <u>xfs_quota</u> <u>(8)</u> can be used  to  apply
       the quota limits to the filesystem.

       Group  and  project  quotas  are  handled  in  a  similar  fashion  and  will be restored in files called
       <u>xfsdump_quotas_group</u> and <u>xfsdump_quotas_proj</u>, respectively.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To restore the root filesystem from a locally mounted tape:

            <b>#</b> <b>xfsrestore</b> <b>-f</b> <b>/dev/tape</b> <b>/</b>

       To restore from a remote tape, specifying the dump session id:

            <b>#</b> <b>xfsrestore</b> <b>-L</b> <b>session_1</b> <b>-f</b> <b>otherhost:/dev/tape</b> <b>/new</b>

       To restore the contents a of a dump to another subdirectory:

            <b>#</b> <b>xfsrestore</b> <b>-f</b> <b>/dev/tape</b> <b>/newdir</b>

       To copy the contents of a filesystem to another directory (see <u><a href="../man8/xfsdump.8.html">xfsdump</a></u>(8)):

            <b>#</b> <b>xfsdump</b> <b>-J</b> <b>-</b> <b>/</b> <b>|</b> <b>xfsrestore</b> <b>-J</b> <b>-</b> <b>/new</b>

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /var/lib/xfsdump/inventory
                                dump inventory database

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit code is 0 on normal completion, and non-zero if an error occurred or the restore was  terminated
       by the operator.

       For  all  verbosity  levels greater than 0 (<b>silent</b>) the final line of the output shows the exit status of
       the restore. It is of the form:

            <b>xfsdump:</b> <b>Restore</b> <b>Status:</b> <u>code</u>

       Where <u>code</u> takes one of the following values: <b>SUCCESS</b> (normal completion), <b>INTERRUPT</b> (interrupted),  <b>QUIT</b>
       (media  no  longer  usable), <b>INCOMPLETE</b> (restore incomplete), <b>FAULT</b> (software error), and <b>ERROR</b> (resource
       error).  Every attempt will be made to keep both the  syntax  and  the  semantics  of  this  log  message
       unchanged  in future versions of xfsrestore.  However, it may be necessary to refine or expand the set of
       exit codes, or their interpretation at some point in the future.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Pathnames of restored non-directory files (relative to  the  <u>dest</u>  directory)  must  be  1023  characters
       (MAXPATHLEN) or less.  Longer pathnames are discarded and a warning message displayed.

       There  is  no verify option to <u>xfsrestore</u>.  This would allow the operator to compare a filesystem dump to
       an existing filesystem, without actually doing a restore.

       The interactive commands (<b>-i</b> option) do not understand regular expressions.

       When the minimal rmt option is specified, <u>xfsrestore</u> applies it to all  remote  tape  sources.  The  same
       blocksize (specified by the <b>-b</b> option) is used for all these remote drives.

       <u>xfsrestore</u> uses the alert program only when a media change is required.

       Cumulative  mode (<b>-r</b> option) requires that the operator invoke <u>xfsrestore</u> for the base and for each delta
       to be applied in sequence to the base.  It would be better to allow the operator  to  identify  the  last
       delta  in  the  sequence  of  interest, and let <u>xfsrestore</u> work backwards from that delta to identify and
       apply the preceding deltas and base dump, all in one invocation.

                                                                                                   <u><a href="../man8/xfsrestore.8.html">xfsrestore</a></u>(8)
