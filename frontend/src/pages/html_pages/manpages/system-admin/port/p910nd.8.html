</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       p910nd - port 9100+n printer daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>p910nd</b> [<b>-f</b> <b>device</b>] [<b>-i</b> <b>bindaddr</b>] [<b>-bvd</b>] [<b>0|1|2</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>p910nd</u>  is  a  small  daemon  that  copies  any  data  received  on  the  port  it is listening on to the
       corresponding printer port.  It is primarily intended for diskless Linux hosts running as printer drivers
       but there is no reason why it could not be used on diskful hosts.  Port 9100 is copied to /dev/lp0,  9101
       to /dev/lp1 and 9102 to /dev/lp2.  The default is port 9100 to /dev/lp0.

       The <b>-f</b> option can be used to specify a different printer device, e.g. /dev/usblp0.

       The  <b>-i</b>  option  can  be  used  to  specify binding to one address instead of all interfaces which is the
       default.

       The <b>-b</b> option turns on bidirectional copying.

       The <b>-v</b> option shows the version number.

       The <b>-d</b> option causes the daemon to run in the foreground in standalone mode and prints  log  messages  to
       stdout for debugging.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>p910nd</u> can be run as a standalone daemon or from (x)inetd.  It will automatically detect if it is running
       under (x)inetd.

       A  sample SysVinit script, <u>p910nd.sh</u>, is provided for operation as a daemon.  <u>p910nd</u> will change its name
       under ps to match the printer port, i.e.  <u>p9100d,</u> <u>p9101d</u> and <u>p9102d</u>.

       When running under (x)inetd, the <u>/etc/inetd.conf</u> entry should look something like this (with  tcpwrappers
       protection):

       p9101 stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /sbin/p910nd

       Don't forget to add an entry in <u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u> for the corresponding port.

       If operating with lprng, use the host%port syntax for the printer device to send jobs to it.

       If  operating  with  CUPS,  this  is  supported  as  the  AppSocket protocol, also known as the JetDirect
       (probably TM) protocol.

       If operating with classic Berkeley lpd,  a  sample  client,  <u>client.pl</u>,  is  provided.   This  should  be
       installed  as  the ifilter (if=) in /etc/printcap.  <u>banner.pl</u> should be installed as the ofilter (of=) in
       /etc/printcap.  It may be necessary to create a dummy spool file for lpd (lp=).  This file will be opened
       but not written to.  The corresponding C versions are left as an exercise for the reader.

       When running under inetd, more than one instance could be  started.   To  avoid  problems  with  multiple
       instances  attempting to access the printer at the same time, make sure that only one client is active at
       any one time. This can be done by designating one host as the spooler and sending all jobs to this  host.
       You will probably need to set up an intermediate queue anyway to provide print job filtering.

       If  built  with  USE_WRAP,  it  uses  the libwrap library (tcpwrappers).  Access control can be done with
       <a href="file:/etc/hosts.allow">/etc/hosts.allow</a> and /etc/hosts.deny. The service name is p910nd.
