        -V, --version                     Print version and exit

       The --listen option (or -i) may be specified multiple times, its syntax is: [ ssl: ] [ host-name-or-IP-
       address ] [ : port ]  or an absolute path (filename) of a Unix socket.  If port is omitted it defaults to
       --port or to 783.  Option --ssl implies a prefix 'ssl:'.  An IPv6 address should be enclosed in square
       brackets, e.g. [::1]:783, an IPv4 address may be but need not be enclosed in square brackets.  An
       asterisk '*' in place of a hostname implies an unspecified address, ('0.0.0.0' or '::'), i.e. it binds to
       all interfaces. An empty option value implies '*'. A default is '--listen localhost', which binds to a
       loopback interface only.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The purpose of this program is to provide a daemonized version of the spamassassin executable.  The goal
       is improving throughput performance for automated mail checking.

       This is intended to be used alongside "spamc", a fast, low-overhead C client program.

       See the README file in the "spamd" directory of the SpamAssassin distribution for more details.

       Note: Although "spamd" will check per-user config files for every message, any changes to the system-wide
       config files will require either restarting spamd or forcing it to reload itself via <b>SIGHUP</b> for the
       changes to take effect.

       Note: If "spamd" receives a <b>SIGHUP</b>, it internally reloads itself, which means that it will change its pid
       and might not restart at all if its environment changed  (ie. if it can't change back into its own
       directory).  If you plan to use <b>SIGHUP</b>, you should always start "spamd" with the <b>-r</b> switch to know its
       current pid.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options of the long form can be shortened as long as they remain unambiguous.  (i.e. <b>--dae</b> can be used
       instead of <b>--daemonize</b>) Also, boolean options (like <b>--user-config</b>) can be negated by adding <u>no</u>
       (<b>--nouser-config</b>), however, this is usually unnecessary.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--allow-tell</b>
           Allow  learning  and  forgetting  (to  a  local  Bayes database), reporting and revoking (to a remote
           database) by spamd. The client issues a TELL command to tell what type of message is being  processed
           and whether local (learn/forget) or remote (report/revoke) databases should be updated.

           Note  that spamd always trusts the username passed in so clients could maliciously learn messages for
           other users.  (This is not usually a concern with an SQL Bayes store as  users  will  typically  have
           read-write access directly to the database, and can also use "sa-learn" with the <b>-u</b> option to achieve
           the same result.)

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--create-prefs</b>
           Create user preferences files if they don't exist (default: don't).

       <b>-C</b> <u>path</u>, <b>--configpath</b>=<u>path</u>
           Use  the  specified  path  for  locating  the  distributed  configuration  files.  Ignore the default
           directories (usually "/usr/share/spamassassin" or similar).

       <b>--siteconfigpath</b>=<u>path</u>
           Use  the  specified  path  for  locating  site-specific  configuration  files.   Ignore  the  default
           directories (usually "/etc/spamassassin" or similar).

       <b>--cf='config</b> <b>line'</b>
           Add  additional lines of configuration directly from the command-line, parsed after the configuration
           files are read.   Multiple <b>--cf</b> arguments can be used, and each will be considered a separate line of
           configuration.

       <b>--pre='config</b> <b>line'</b>
           Add additional lines of  .pre  configuration  directly  from  the  command-line,  parsed  before  the
           configuration  files  are  read.  Multiple <b>--pre</b> arguments can be used, and each will be considered a
           separate line of configuration.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--daemonize</b>
           Detach from starting process and run in background (daemonize).

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a brief help message, then exit without further action.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print version information, then exit without further action.

       <b>-i</b> [<u>ipaddress</u>[:&lt;port&gt;]], <b>--listen</b>[=<u>ipaddress</u>[:&lt;port&gt;]]
           Additional alias names for this option are --listen-ip and --ip-address.  Tells spamd  to  listen  on
           the  specified IP address, defaults to a loopback interface, i.e. "--listen localhost").  If no value
           is specified after the switch, or if an asterisk '*' stands in place of an  &lt;ipaddress&gt;,  spamd  will
           listen on all interfaces - this is equivalent to address '0.0.0.0' for IPv4 and to '::' for IPv6. You
           can  also use a valid hostname which will make spamd listen on all addresses that a name resolves to.
           The option may be specified multiple times. See also options -4 and -6 for restricting address family
           to IPv4 or to IPv6. If a port is specified it overrides  for  this  socket  the  global  --port  (and
           --ssl-port)  setting.  An  IPv6  addresses should be enclosed in square brackets, e.g. [::1]:783. For
           compatibility square brackets on an IPv6 address may be omitted if a  port  number  specification  is
           also omitted.

       <b>-p</b> <u>port</u>, <b>--port</b>=<u>port</u>
           Optionally specifies the port number for the server to listen on (default: 783).

           If  the  <b>--ssl</b>  switch is used, and <b>--ssl-port</b> is not supplied, then this port will be used to accept
           SSL connections instead of unencrypted connections.  If the <b>--ssl</b> switch is used, and  <b>--ssl-port</b>  is
           set,  then  unencrypted  connections  will  be  accepted  on the <b>--port</b> at the same time as encrypted
           connections are accepted at <b>--ssl-port</b>.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--sql-config</b>
           Turn on SQL lookups even when per-user config files have been disabled with <b>-x</b>. this  is  useful  for
           spamd hosts which don't have user's home directories but do want to load user preferences from an SQL
           database.

           If  your  spamc  client  does  not  support  sending the "User:" header, like "exiscan", then the SQL
           username used will always be <b>nobody</b>.

           This inhibits the <b>setuid()</b> behavior, so the "-u"  option  is  required.  If  you  want  the  <b>setuid()</b>
           behaviour, use "-Q" or "--setuid-with-sql" instead.

       <b>--ldap-config</b>
           Turn on LDAP lookups. This is completely analog to "--sql-config", only it is using an LDAP server.

           Like  "--sql-config",  this  disables  the  setuid  behavior,  and requires "-u". If you want it, use
           "--setuid-with-ldap" instead.

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--setuid-with-sql</b>
           Turn on SQL lookups even when per-user config files have been disabled with <b>-x</b> and also setuid to the
           user.  This is useful for spamd hosts which want to load user preferences from an  SQL  database  but
           also wish to support the use of <b>-H</b> (Helper home directories.)

       <b>--setuid-with-ldap</b>
           Turn  on  LDAP  lookups even when per-user config files have been disabled with <b>-x</b> and also setuid to
           the user.  This is again completely analog to "--setuid-with-sql", only it is using an LDAP server.

       <b>--virtual-config-dir</b>=<u>pattern</u>
           This option specifies where per-user preferences can be found for virtual users, for the  <b>-x</b>  switch.
           The  <u>pattern</u>  is  used as a base pattern for the directory name.  Any of the following escapes can be
           used:

           %u -- replaced with the full name of the current user, as sent by spamc.
           %l -- replaced with the 'local part' of the current username.  In other words, if the username is an
           email address, this is the part before the "@" sign.
           %d -- replaced with the 'domain' of the current username.  In other words, if the username is an
           email address, this is the part after the "@" sign.
           %x -- replaced with the full name of the current user, as sent by spamc. If the resulting config
           directory does not exist, replace with the domain part to use a domain-wide default.
           %% -- replaced with a single percent sign (%).

           So for example, if "/vhome/users/%u/spamassassin" is specified, and spamc sends a virtual username of
           "<a href="mailto:jm@example.com">jm@example.com</a>", the directory "/vhome/users/<a href="mailto:jm@example.com">jm@example.com</a>/spamassassin" will be used.

           The set of characters allowed in the virtual username for this path are restricted to:

                   A-Z a-z 0-9 - + _ . , @ =

           All others will be replaced by underscores ("_").

           This path must be a writable directory.  It will be created if it does not already exist.  If a  file
           called <b>user_prefs</b> exists in this directory (note: <b>not</b> in a ".spamassassin" subdirectory!), it will be
           loaded  as  the  user's  preferences.   The  Bayes  databases  for  that  user will be stored in this
           directory.

           Note that  this  <b>requires</b>  that  <b>-x</b>  is  used,  and  cannot  be  combined  with  SQL-  or  LDAP-based
           configuration.

           The pattern <b>must</b> expand to an absolute directory when spamd is running daemonized (<b>-d</b>).

           Currently, use of this without <b>-u</b> is not supported. This inhibits setuid.

       <b>-r</b> <u>pidfile</u>, <b>--pidfile</b>=<u>pidfile</u>
           Write the process ID of the spamd parent to the file specified by <u>pidfile</u>.  The file will be unlinked
           when  the parent exits.  Note that when running with the <b>-u</b> option, the file must be writable by that
           user.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--vpopmail</b>
           Enable vpopmail config.  If specified with <b>-u</b>  set  to  the  vpopmail  user,  this  allows  spamd  to
           lookup/create  user_prefs  in  the  vpopmail  user's own maildir.  This option is useful for vpopmail
           virtual users who do not have an entry in the system <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> file.

           Currently, use of this without <b>-u</b> is not supported. This inhibits setuid.

       <b>-s</b> <u>facility</u>, <b>--syslog</b>=<u>facility</u>
           Specify the syslog facility to use (default: mail).  If "stderr" is specified, output will be written
           to stderr. (This is useful if you're  running  "spamd"  under  the  "daemontools"  package.)  With  a
           <u>facility</u> of "file", all output goes to spamd.log. <u>facility</u> is interpreted as a file name to log to if
           it contains any characters except a-z and 0-9. "null" disables logging completely (used internally).

           Examples:

                   spamd -s mail                 # use syslog, facility mail (default)
                   spamd -s ./mail               # log to file ./mail
                   spamd -s stderr 2&gt;/dev/null   # log to stderr, throw messages away
                   spamd -s null                 # the same as above
                   spamd -s file                 # log to file ./spamd.log
                   spamd -s /var/log/spamd.log   # log to file /var/log/spamd.log

           If logging to a file is enabled and that log file is rotated, the spamd server must be restarted with
           a SIGHUP. (If the log file is just truncated, this is not needed but still recommended.)

           Note that logging to a file does not use locking, so you cannot intermix logging from spamd and other
           processes into the same file.  If you want to mix logging like this, use syslog instead.

           If  you use syslog logging, it is essential to send a SIGHUP to the spamd daemon when you restart the
           syslogd daemon.  (This is due to a shortcoming in Perl's syslog handling, where the disappearance  of
           the connection to the syslogd is considered a fatal error.)

       <b>--syslog-socket</b>=<u>type</u>
           Specify how spamd should send messages to syslogd. The <u>type</u> can be any of the socket types or logging
           mechanisms  as  accepted  by  the  subroutine  <b>Sys::Syslog::setlogsock()</b>.  Depending  on a version of
           Sys::Syslog and on the underlying operating system, one of the following values (or their subset) can
           be used: "native", "eventlog", "tcp", "udp", "inet", "unix", "stream",  "pipe",  or  "console".   The
           value  "eventlog" is specific to Win32 events logger and requires a perl module Win32::EventLog to be
           installed.  For more information please consult the Sys::Syslog documentation.

           A historical setting --syslog-socket=none is mapped to --syslog=stderr.

           A default for Windows platforms is "none", otherwise the default is to try "unix" first, falling back
           to "inet" if perl detects errors in its "unix" support.

           Some platforms, or versions  of  perl,  are  shipped  with  old  or  dysfunctional  versions  of  the
           <b>Sys::Syslog</b>  module  which  do  not  support  some  socket  types, so you may need to set this option
           explicitly.  If you get error messages regarding <b>__PATH_LOG</b>  or  similar  spamd,  try  changing  this
           setting.

           The socket types "file" is used internally and should not be specified.  Use the "-s" switch instead.

       <b>--log-timestamp-fmt</b>=<u>format</u>
           The --log-timestamp-fmt option can provide a POSIX <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3) format for timestamps included in each
           logged  message. Each logger (stderr, file, syslog) has its own default value for a timestamp format,
           which applies when --log-timestamp-fmt option is not given,  or  with  --log-timestamp-fmt=default  .
           Timestamps   can   be   turned   off   by   specifying   an  empty  string  with  this  option,  e.g.
           --log-timestamp-fmt='' or just --log-timestamp-fmt= .  Typical  use:  --log-timestamp-fmt='%a  %b  %e
           %H:%M:%S  %Y'  (provides  localized  weekday and month names in the <b><a href="../man3/ctime.3.html">ctime</a></b>(3) style), or '%a, %e %b %Y
           %H:%M:%S %z (%Z)' for a RFC 2822 format, or maybe '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%z' for an ISO  8601  (EN  28601)
           format, or just '%Y%m%dT%H%M%S' .

       <b>-u</b> <u>username</u>, <b>--username</b>=<u>username</u>
           Run  as  the named user.  If this option is not set, the default behaviour is to <b>setuid()</b> to the user
           running "spamc", if "spamd" is running as root.

           Note: "--username=root" is not a valid option.  If specified, "spamd" will exit with a fatal error on
           startup.

       <b>-g</b> <u>groupname</u>, <b>--groupname</b>=<u>groupname</u>
           Run as the named group if --username is being used. If this option is not set when --username is used
           then the primary group for the user given to --username is used.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--nouser-config</b>, <b>--user-config</b>
           Turn off (on) reading of per-user configuration files (user_prefs) from the  user's  home  directory.
           The   default   behaviour   is  to  read  per-user  configuration  from  the  user's  home  directory
           (<b>--user-config</b>).

           This option does not disable or otherwise influence the SQL, LDAP or Virtual Config Dir settings.

       <b>-U</b> <u>username</u>, <b>--default-user</b>=<u>username</u>
           Fall back to this username, if the username provided by spamc is not found.  Default is <u>nobody</u>, which
           might not exist or not have a usable home directory, use this setting to define a  suitable  user  if
           needed.

       <b>-A</b> <u>host,...</u>, <b>--allowed-ips</b>=<u>host,...</u>
           Specify  a  comma-separated  list  of  authorized  hosts  or networks which can connect to this spamd
           instance. Each element of the list is either a single IP addresses, or a range  of  IP  addresses  in
           address/masklength  CIDR  notation, or ranges of IPv4 addresses by specifying 3 or less octets with a
           trailing dot.  Hostnames are not supported,  only  IPv4  or  IPv6  addresses.   This  option  can  be
           specified multiple times, or can take a list of addresses separated by commas.  IPv6 addresses may be
           (but need not be) enclosed in square brackets for consistency with option <b>--listen</b>.  Examples:

           <b>-A</b> <b>10.11.12.13</b> -- only allow connections from 10.11.12.13.

           <b>-A</b> <b>10.11.12.13,10.11.12.14</b> -- only allow connections from 10.11.12.13 and 10.11.12.14.

           <b>-A</b> <b>10.200.300.0/24</b> -- allow connections from any machine in the range "10.200.300.*".

           <b>-A</b> <b>10.</b> -- allow connections from any machine in the range "10.*.*.*".

           <b>-A</b>  <b>[2001:db8::]/32,192.0.2.0/24,::1,127.0.0.0/8</b>  --  only  accept  connections  from  specified test
           networks and from localhost.

           In absence of the <b>-A</b> option, connections are only accepted from IP address  127.0.0.1  or  ::1,  i.e.
           from localhost on a loopback interface.

       <b>-D</b> [<u>area,...</u>], <b>--debug</b> [<u>area,...</u>]
           Produce  debugging  output.  If no areas are listed, all debugging information is printed. Diagnostic
           output can also be enabled for each area individually; <u>area</u> is the area of the  code  to  instrument.
           For example, to produce diagnostic output on bayes, learn, and dns, use:

                   spamassassin -D bayes,learn,dns

           Higher  priority  informational  messages  that  are suitable for logging in normal circumstances are
           available with an area of "info".

           For more information about which areas (also  known  as  channels)  are  available,  please  see  the
           documentation at:

                   C&lt;https://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/DebugChannels&gt;

       <b>-4</b>, <b>--ipv4only</b>, <b>--ipv4-only</b>, <b>--ipv4</b>
           Use  IPv4  where applicable, do not use IPv6.  The option affects a set of listen sockets (see option
           "--listen") and disables IPv6 for DNS tests.

       <b>-6</b>  Use IPv6 where applicable, do not use IPv4.  The option affects a set of listen sockets  (see  option
           "--listen")  and  disables  IPv4  for DNS tests. Installing a module IO::Socket::IP is recommended if
           spamd is expected to receive requests over IPv6.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--local</b>
           Perform only local tests on all mail.  In other words, skip DNS and other network tests.   Works  the
           same as the "-L" flag to <a href="../man1/spamassassin.1.html">spamassassin</a>(1).

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--paranoid</b>
           Die  on user errors (for the user passed from spamc) instead of falling back to user "--default-user"
           and using the default configuration.

       <b>-m</b> <u>number</u> , <b>--max-children</b>=<u>number</u>
           This option specifies the maximum number of children to spawn.   Spamd  will  spawn  that  number  of
           children, then sleep in the background until a child dies, wherein it will go and spawn a new child.

           Incoming  connections can still occur if all of the children are busy, however those connections will
           be queued waiting for a free child.  The minimum value is 1, the default value is 5.

           Please note that there is a OS specific maximum of connections that can be queued (Try "perl -MSocket
           -e'print SOMAXCONN'" to find this maximum).

           Note that if you run too many servers for the amount of free RAM available, you  run  the  danger  of
           hurting  performance  by  causing  a  high  swap  load  as  server  processes  are swapped in and out
           continually.

       <b>--min-children</b>=<u>number</u>
           The minimum number of children that will be kept running.  The minimum value is 1, the default  value
           is 1.  If you have lots of free RAM, you may want to increase this.

       <b>--min-spare</b>=<u>number</u>
           The lower limit for the number of spare children allowed to run.  A spare, or idle, child is one that
           is not handling a scan request.   If there are too few spare children available, a new server will be
           started every second or so.  The default value is 1.

       <b>--max-spare</b>=<u>number</u>
           The  upper  limit  for  the  number  of  spare  children allowed to run.  If there are too many spare
           children, one will be killed every second or so until the number of idle children is in  the  desired
           range.  The default value is 2.

       <b>--max-conn-per-child</b>=<u>number</u>
           This  option  specifies  the maximum number of connections each child should process before dying and
           letting the master spamd process spawn a new child.  The minimum value is 1,  the  default  value  is
           200.

       <b>--round-robin</b>
           By default, "spamd" will attempt to keep a small number of "hot" child processes as busy as possible,
           and  keep  any others as idle as possible, using something similar to the Apache httpd server scaling
           algorithm.  This is accomplished by the master process coordinating the activities of  the  children.
           This switch will disable this scaling algorithm, and the behaviour seen in the 3.0.x versions will be
           used instead, where all processes receive an equal load and no scaling takes place.

       <b>--timeout-tcp</b>=<u>number</u>
           This  option specifies the number of seconds to wait for headers from a client (spamc) before closing
           the connection.  The minimum value is 1, the default value is 30, and  a  value  of  0  will  disable
           socket timeouts completely.

       <b>--timeout-child</b>=<u>number</u>
           This  option specifies the number of seconds to wait for a spamd child to process or check a message.
           The minimum value is 1, the default value is 300, and a  value  of  0  will  disable  child  timeouts
           completely.

       <b>-H</b> <u>directory</u>, <b>--helper-home-dir</b>=<u>directory</u>
           Specify  that external programs such as Razor, DCC, and Pyzor should have a HOME environment variable
           set to a specific directory.  The default is to use the HOME environment variable  setting  from  the
           shell  running  spamd.   By  specifying no argument, spamd will use the spamc caller's home directory
           instead.

       <b>--ssl</b>
           Accept only SSL connections on  the  associated  port.   The  <b>IO::Socket::SSL</b>  perl  module  must  be
           installed.

           If  the <b>--ssl</b> switch is used, and <b>--ssl-port</b> is not supplied, then <b>--port</b> port will be used to accept
           SSL connections instead of unencrypted connections.  If the <b>--ssl</b> switch is used, and  <b>--ssl-port</b>  is
           set,  then  unencrypted  connections  will  be  accepted on the <b>--port</b>, at the same time as encrypted
           connections are accepted at <b>--ssl-port</b>.

       <b>--ssl-verify</b>
           Implies <b>--ssl</b>.  Request a client certificate and verify the certificate.  Requires  <b>--ssl-ca-file</b>  or
           <b>--ssl-ca-path</b>.

       <b>--ssl-ca-file</b>=<u>cafile</u>
           Implies  <b>--ssl-verify</b>.   Use  the  specified  Certificate  Authority certificate to verify the client
           certificate.  The client certificate must be signed by this certificate.

       <b>--ssl-ca-path</b>=<u>capath</u>
           Implies <b>--ssl-verify</b>.  Use the Certificate Authority  certificate  files  in  the  specified  set  of
           directories  to verify the client certificate.  The client certificate must be signed by one of these
           Certificate Authorities.  See the man page for <b>IO::Socket::SSL</b> for additional details.

       <b>--ssl-port</b>=<u>port</u>
           Optionally specifies the port number for the server  to  listen  on  for  SSL  connections  (default:
           whatever --port uses).  See <b>--ssl</b> for more details.

       <b>--server-key</b> <u>keyfile</u>
           Specify the SSL key file to use for SSL connections.

       <b>--server-cert</b> <u>certfile</u>
           Specify the SSL certificate file to use for SSL connections.

       <b>--socketpath</b> <u>pathname</u>
           Listen  on  a UNIX domain socket at path <u>pathname</u>, in addition to sockets specified with a "--listen"
           option. This option is provided for compatibility with older versions of spamd. Starting with version
           3.4.0 the "--listen" option can also take a UNIX domain socket as its value (an absolute path  name).
           Unlike "--socketpath", the "--listen" option may be specified multiple times if spamd needs to listen
           on multiple UNIX or INET or INET6 sockets.

           Warning:  the  Perl  support  on  BSD platforms for UNIX domain sockets seems to have a bug regarding
           paths of over 100 bytes or so (SpamAssassin bug 4380).  If you see a 'could  not  find  newly-created
           UNIX  socket'  error  message,  and  the  path appears truncated, this may be the cause.  Try using a
           shorter path to the socket.

           By default, use of <b>--socketpath</b> without <b>--listen</b> will inhibit SSL  connections  and  unencrypted  TCP
           connections.  To add other sockets, specify them with <b>--listen</b>, e.g. '--listen=:' or '--listen=*:'

       <b>--socketowner</b> <u>name</u>
           Set  UNIX  domain  socket  to be owned by the user named <u>name</u>.  Note that this requires that spamd be
           started as "root", and if "-u" is used, that user should have write permissions to  unlink  the  file
           later, for when the "spamd" server is killed.

       <b>--socketgroup</b> <u>name</u>
           Set  UNIX  domain  socket  to  be  owned  by  the group named <u>name</u>.  See "--socketowner" for notes on
           ownership and permissions.

       <b>--socketmode</b> <u>mode</u>
           Set UNIX domain socket to use the octal mode <u>mode</u>.  Note that if "-u" is used, that user should  have
           write permissions to unlink the file later, for when the "spamd" server is killed.

       <b>--timing</b>
             Enable timing measurements and output the information for logging.  This
             is the same information as provided by the TIMING tag.
