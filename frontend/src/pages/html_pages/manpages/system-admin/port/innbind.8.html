</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       innbind - Helper program to bind sockets to privileged ports

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>innbind</b> [<b>-p</b>] <u>fd</u>,<u>family</u>,<u>address</u>,<u>port</u> [...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>innbind</b> is a helper program that's not meant to be run directly.  Instead, <b>innd</b> and <b>nnrpd</b> use it
       internally to bind to ports that require root privileges to bind to.

       This program must be installed setuid root in order for <b>innd</b> or <b>nnrpd</b> to bind to ports under 1024.  The
       only functions that it's willing to perform are to bind an open file descriptor to a given address and
       port or to create a new socket, bind it, and return the bound socket to its caller.  It can only be run
       as the news user (as specified at configure time), and will only bind to ports 119, 433, 563, an
       additional port specified with the <b>--with-innd-port</b> argument to configure, or ports numbered 1024 or
       higher.

       Each argument to <b>innbind</b> must be a comma-separated list of four elements.  The first is the file
       descriptor number that should be bound, the second is the numeric family of the socket (AF_INET or
       AF_INET6), the third is the local address to bind to (in dotted-quad format for IPv4 and in colon-
       separated address format for IPv6), and the fourth is the port number.  To bind to all addresses with
       IPv4, use "0.0.0.0" as the address.  To bind to all addresses with IPv6, use "::" as the address.

       Multiple arguments can be specified to tell <b>innbind</b> to bind multiple sockets at the same time.  Any
       errors (other than permission denied -- see below) encountered will cause <b>innbind</b> to abort, and error
       messages will be sent both to syslog and to standard error.

       By default, <b>innbind</b> attempts to just bind the already open file descriptor that it inherits from its
       caller.  For each successfully bound file descriptor (in the order given on the command line), <b>innbind</b>
       prints "ok" and a newline to its standard output.

       On some systems (apparently just STREAMS-based systems), however, even a setuid root program cannot bind
       a socket to a privileged port that was created by a process that didn't have permissions.  If <b>innbind</b>
       gets permission denied when trying to bind a socket, it will print "no" and a newline to its standard
       output.  It will then create a new socket, bind it as specified, and then attempt to pass that socket
       back to its caller using the I_SENDFD STREAMS ioctl.  The caller should receive that file descriptor with
       I_RECVFD and use it instead of the one that it created.

       Note that file descriptor passing is only supported on STREAMS-based systems since it is done with ioctls
       over a pipe.  However, it is believed that those systems are exactly the systems that can't simply bind
       the inherited file descriptor.  If this assumption proves to be incorrect, traditional BSD file
       descriptor passing over a Unix domain socket will have to be added.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-p</b>  If  given  as  the  first  command-line  argument, no attempt will be made to bind the inherited file
           descriptor and <b>innbind</b> will only try creation of a new  file  descriptor  and  passing  it  back  via
           standard output.  This option is primarily useful for testing.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       As  <b>innbind</b>  is  normally  installed setuid root, security is even more of an issue for it than for other
       parts of INN.  It is a fairly short program, and if you understand C, you  are  encouraged  to  audit  it
       yourself  to  be  certain that it does only what it is supposed to do.  The only INN library functions it
       uses are the vector functions, the message functions for error reporting, and xstrdup.

       The ports that will be bound are restricted to prevent potential attacks made possible by the ability  to
       bind  low-numbered  ports, such as exploits of the <a href="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh</a>(1) family of commands on some systems.  If <b>innbind</b>
       is installed setuid root, it can only be executed by the news user to prevent other users on  the  system
       from being able to bind to even those few privileged ports that it allows.

       <b>innbind</b>  uses  no  external  configuration  files;  the  only  files it might open are through the system
       <a href="../man3/getpwnam.3.html">getpwnam</a>(3) service to get the UID of the news user.  The  only  user  input  that  it  accepts  are  its
       command-line arguments.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>innbind</b> may log the following messages to syslog and print them to standard error.

       cannot create socket for %s: %s
           (Fatal)  <b>innbind</b>  fell  back on attempting to create a new socket to bind for the given argument, and
           the socket creation failed.

       cannot bind socket for %s: %s
           (Fatal) Calling bind for the socket corresponding to the given argument failed with a  system  error.
           If  the  error  indicates permission denied, make sure that <b>innbind</b> is setuid root.  This can also be
           caused by trying to use IPv6 on a system whose kernel does not support it.

       cannot bind to restricted port %hu in %s
           (Fatal) The port number portion of the given command-line argument is for a port below 1024 which  is
           not  119,  433,  563,  or  a  port  given to <b>--with-innd-port</b> at configure time.  Other ports are not
           allowed for security reasons.

       cannot get socket options for file descriptor %d: %s
           (Fatal) <b>innbind</b> was unable to get the socket options for that file descriptor.  The most likely cause
           of this error is passing the wrong file descriptor number to <b>innbind</b> (a file  descriptor  that  isn't
           open, or that corresponds to a regular file rather than a network socket).

       cannot get UID for %s
           (Fatal)  <b>innbind</b>  was  unable  to  get  the  UID  for  the  news user specified during configure (and
           defaulting to "news").  This normally means that user isn't in the system <u>passwd</u> file.

       cannot mark socket reusable for %s: %s
           (Fatal) <b>innbind</b> created a new socket for the given argument but was unable to mark its  bind  address
           reusable (the SO_REUSEADDR socket option).

       cannot pass file descriptor: %s
           (Fatal)  <b>innbind</b> created and bound a new file descriptor but was unable to pass it back to its caller
           via its standard output, using the I_SENDFD STREAMS ioctl.

       invalid file descriptor %d: not SOCK_STREAM
           (Fatal) The given file descriptor is not a SOCK_STREAM socket.  <b>innbind</b>  can  only  bind  SOCK_STREAM
           sockets.

       invalid IPv4 address %s in %s
           (Fatal)  The  IPv4  address  specified  in  the  given  command-line  option  could  not be parsed by
           <a href="../man3/inet_aton.3.html">inet_aton</a>(3).  IPv4 addresses should be specified in the standard dotted-quad format (10.2.3.4).

       invalid IPv6 address %s in %s
           (Fatal) The IPv6 address  specified  in  the  given  command-line  option  could  not  be  parsed  by
           <a href="../man3/inet_pton.3.html">inet_pton</a>(3).   IPv6  addresses should be specified in RFC 4291 format (1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:417A or
           1080::8:800:200C:417A).

       invalid command-line argument %s
           (Fatal) The specified command-line argument could not be parsed or was not in the correct format.

       invalid file descriptor %s in %s
           (Fatal) The file descriptor portion of the given command-line argument is not a non-negative integer.

       invalid port number %s in %s
           (Fatal) The port number portion of the given command-line argument is not a non-negative integer.

       invalid protocol family %s in %s
           (Fatal) The protocol family portion of the given command-line argument is not a non-negative integer.
           It should be equal to either AF_INET or AF_INET6 on the system where <b>innbind</b> is run.

       must be run by user %s (%lu), not %lu
           (Fatal) When setuid root, <b>innbind</b> may only be run by the news user as  specified  at  configure  time
           ("news" by default), for security reasons.

       no addresses specified
           (Fatal) No arguments were given on the command line (except maybe <b>-p</b>).

       port may not be zero in %s
           (Fatal) The port number portion of the given command-line argument was zero.

       unknown protocol family %s in %s
           (Fatal)  The  protocol  number  portion  of  the  given  command-line argument is neither AF_INET nor
           AF_INET6.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       As mentioned above, <b>innbind</b> is never run directly, only by <b>innd</b> and other programs that need to  bind  to
       and listen to network ports.  Sample invocations by <b>innd</b> would be:

           innbind 3,10,::,119

       to bind the IPv6 socket on file descriptor 3 to port 119, all addresses, or:

           innbind 6,2,10.0.0.3,433

       to bind the IPv4 socket on file descriptor 6 to port 433 in the address 10.0.0.3.
