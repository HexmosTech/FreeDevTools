</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bwctld - <b>B</b>and<b>w</b>idth <b>C</b>on<b>t</b>ro<b>l</b> server.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bwctld</b>  [  <b>-a</b>  <u>auth_mode</u> ] [ <b>-c</b> <u>conf_dir</u> ] [ <b>-e</b> <u>facility</u> ] [ <b>-f</b> ] [ <b>-G</b> <u>group</u> ] [ <b>-h</b> ] [ <b>-R</b> <u>var_dir</u> ] [ <b>-S</b>
       <u>nodename:port</u> ] [ <b>-U</b> <u>user</u> ] [ <b>-v</b> ] [ <b>-Z</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bwctld</b> is a server program designed to schedule and run  <b>Iperf</b>,  <b>Thrulay</b>  or  <b>Nuttcp</b>,  <b>Ping</b>,  <b>Traceroute</b>,
       <b>Tracepath</b>, and <b>Owamp</b> tests.

       Aside  from actually running network measurement tests, the main function of <b>bwctld</b> is to determine which
       tests are allowable based upon the policy restrictions configured by the system administrator.

       <b>bwctld</b> was designed to be run as a stand-alone daemon process. It uses the classic accept/fork  model  of
       handling new requests.

       Most  of  the command line options for <b>bwctld</b> have analogous options in the <b>bwctld.conf</b> file. The command
       line takes precedence.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b> <u>auth_mode</u>
              Specify the authentication modes the server is willing to use for communication. <u>auth_mode</u>  should
              be set as a character string with any or all of the characters "AEO". The modes are:

              <b>A</b>      [<b>A</b>]uthenticated. This mode encrypts the control connection.

              <b>E</b>      [<b>E</b>]ncrypted.  This  mode  encrypts the control connection. If the test supports encryption,
                     this mode will additionally encrypt the test stream. (Encryption of the test stream is  not
                     currently supported, so this mode is currently identical to authenticated.)

              <b>O</b>      [<b>O</b>]pen. No encryption of any kind is done.

              The server can specify all the modes with which it is willing to communicate. The most strict mode
              that both the server and the client are willing to use will be selected.

              Default:
                     "AEO".

       <b>-c</b> <u>conf_dir</u>
              Specify the directory that holds the <b>bwctld</b> configuration files.

              Default:
                     Current working directory.

       <b>-e</b> <u>facility</u>
              Syslog <u>facility</u> to which messages are logged.

              Default:
                     LOG_DAEMON

       <b>-f</b>     Enables the <b>bwctld</b> daemon to run with <u>root</u> permissions. There are legitimate reasons to run <b>bwctld</b>
              as root, but it is risky. Forcing this additional option will make it less likely root permissions
              are accidently used.

       <b>-G</b> <u>group</u>
              Specify  the  gid  for  the  <b>bwctld</b> process. <u>group</u> can be specified using a valid group name or by
              using -gid. This option is only used if <b>bwctld</b> is started as root.

       <b>-h</b>     Print a help message.

       <b>-R</b> <u>var_dir</u>
              Specify the directory to hold the bwctld.pid file.

              Default:
                     Current directory

       <b>-S</b> <u>nodename:port</u>
              Specify the address and port on which <b>bwctld</b> will listen for requests.  <u>nodename</u> can be  specified
              using  a  DNS  name  or using the textual representation of the address. It is possible to set the
              source address without setting the <u>port</u> simply by leaving off the ':' and <u>port</u>  specification.  If
              an  IPv6 address is specified, note that the accepted format contains <u>nodename</u> in square brackets,
              such  as:  [fe80::fe9f:62d8].  This  ensures  the  port  number  is  distinct  from  the   address
              specification.

              Default:
                     <u>nodename</u> is wildcarded as any currently available address.  <u>port</u> is 4823.

       <b>-U</b> <u>user</u>
              Specify  the uid for the <b>bwctld</b> process. <u>user</u> can be specified using a valid user name or by using
              -uid. This option is only used if <b>bwctld</b> is started as root.

       <b>-v</b>     Set verbose output. Messages will only go to syslog unless the <b>-Z</b> option is specified.

       <b>-Z</b>     Run the master <b>bwctld</b> process in the foreground. In this  mode,  error  messages  are  printed  to
              stderr  as  well  as  being  sent  to syslog. Also, normal terminal controls are available. (i.e.,
              &lt;Cntr-C&gt; will cause the daemon to kill  it's  child  processes  and  exit.)  This  is  useful  for
              debugging.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>bwctld</b> daemon prefers a reasonably synchronized clock. It is scheduling tests and needs to be sure it
       has  the  same  idea  of  when  a test should take place as does the peer test system.  Therefore, <b>bwctld</b>
       attempts to use NTP specific system calls to determine the accuracy of the local clock. If  those  system
       calls are unavailable, or the administrator has set the <u>allow_unsync</u> option in the <b>bwctld.conf</b> file, then
       <b>bwctld</b> will blindly accept tests assuming the clock is synchronized to within the <u>sync_fuzz</u> value that is
       also  defined  in  the  <b>bwctld.conf</b>  file.  If  this  assumption  does  not hold true, then the test will
       eventually fail. Unfortunately, because the time offset is not detected early, this test will have  taken
       up a schedule slot.
