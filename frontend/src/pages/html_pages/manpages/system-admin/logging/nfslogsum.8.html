</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nfslogsum - summarize <b>nfswatch</b> log file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nfslogsum</b> [ <u>-n</u> ] [ <b>-v</b> ] [ <u>logfile</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>nfslogsum</u> summarizes log files produced by the <u>nfswatch</u> program.  By default the log file <u>nfswatch.log</u> is
       summarized; an alternate log file can be specified on the command line.

       Each  <u>nfswatch</u> log file may contain one or more log sessions, each indicated by a header which is printed
       when logging is turned on.  For each log session, <u>nfslogsum</u> tallies up the  interval  packet  totals  and
       prints  out  a one-page summary of the log session.  Total packets and percentages are tabulated for each
       category and displayed.

       The <b>-n</b> option tells <u>nfslogsum</u> to read only the first <u>n</u> entries in the  log  file.   This  is  useful  for
       summarizing log files in cumulative ``chunks''.

       If  the <b>-v</b> option is given, <u>nfslogsum</u> will produce a ``verbose'' summary of the log file.  In addition to
       the summary information printed as described above, a summary of how many calls  to  each  NFS  procedure
       were  made  on each file system and individual file will be printed.  This summary information is divided
       into three sections of six columns each.  The columns are headed by the  names  of  the  NFS  procedures;
       these are described briefly below:

       <b>NULLPROC</b>
              Do nothing.  This procedure is provided to allow server response testing and timing.

       <b>GETATTR</b>
              Get  file  attributes  (type,  mode,  number  of  links,  owner's  uid, owner's gid, size, access,
              modification and change times, etc.).  This procedure is used by the <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) system call, as  well
              as several others.

       <b>SETATTR</b>
              Set  file  attributes   (mode,  owner's  uid,  owner's gid, size in bytes, access and modification
              times).  This procedure is used by system calls such as <u><a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</a></u>(2), <u><a href="../man2/chown.2.html">chown</a></u>(2),  <u><a href="../man2/truncate.2.html">truncate</a></u>(2),  and  so
              on.

       <b>GETROOT</b>
              Get  file  system  root.   This  procedure  is obsolete, and has been replaced by a MOUNT Protocol
              procedure.

       <b>LOOKUP</b> Look up file name.  This procedure is used to obtain an initial file handle for use in current and
              future requests on that file, and is used by many different system calls.

       <b>READLINK</b>
              Read from symbolic link.  This procedure is used by the <b>readlink</b> system call, and by the kernel.

       <b>READ</b>   Read data from file.  This procedure is used by the <u><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></u>(2) system call.

       <b>WCACHE</b> Write to cache.  Unused in the current NFS protocol revision.

       <b>WRITE</b>  Write data to file.  This procedure is used by the <u><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></u>(2) system call.

       <b>CREATE</b> Create file.  This procedure is used by the <u><a href="../man2/creat.2.html">creat</a></u>(2) and <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) system calls.

       <b>REMOVE</b> Remove file.  This procedure is used by the <u><a href="../man2/unlink.2.html">unlink</a></u>(2) system call.

       <b>RENAME</b> Rename file.  This procedure is used by the <b>rename</b> system call.

       <b>LINK</b>   Create link to file.  This procedure is used by the <u><a href="../man2/link.2.html">link</a></u>(2) system call.

       <b>SYMLINK</b>
              Create symbolic link to file.  This procedure is used by the <u><a href="../man2/symlink.2.html">symlink</a></u>(2) system call.

       <b>MKDIR</b>  Create directory.  This procedure is used by the <u><a href="../man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir</a></u>(2) system call.

       <b>RMDIR</b>  Remove directory.  This procedure is used by the <u><a href="../man2/rmdir.2.html">rmdir</a></u>(2) system call.

       <b>READDIR</b>
              Read entries from directory.  Generally only one READDIR call is needed  per  directory,  since  a
              variable number of entries can be returned.

       <b>STATFS</b> Get  file  system  attributes  (transfer  size,  block  size,  blocks  in use, blocks free).  This
              procedure is used by the <u><a href="../man2/statfs.2.html">statfs</a></u>(2) system call.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>nfslogsum</u> is exteremely sensitive to the format of the log file  produced  by  <u>nfswatch</u>.   The  log  file
       should not be edited or changed before feeding it to <u>nfslogsum</u>.
