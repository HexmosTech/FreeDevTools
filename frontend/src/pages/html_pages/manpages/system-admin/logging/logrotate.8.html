</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       logrotate ‐ rotates, compresses, and mails system logs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>logrotate</b>  [<b>--force</b>]  [<b>--debug</b>]  [<b>--state</b>  <u>file</u>]  [<b>--skip-state-lock</b>] [<b>--wait-for-state-lock</b>] [<b>--verbose</b>]
       [<b>--log</b> <u>file</u>] [<b>--mail</b> <u>command</u>] <u>config_file</u> [<u>config_file2</u> <u>...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>logrotate</b> is designed to ease administration of systems that generate large numbers  of  log  files.   It
       allows  automatic rotation, compression, removal, and mailing of log files.  Each log file may be handled
       daily, weekly, monthly, or when it grows too large.

       Normally, <b>logrotate</b> is run as a daily cron job.  It will not modify a log  more  than  once  in  one  day
       unless  the  criterion  for that log is based on the log's size and <b>logrotate</b> is being run more than once
       each day, or unless the <b>-f</b> or <b>--force</b> option is used.

       Any number of config files may be given on the command line.  Later config files may override the options
       given in earlier files, so the order in which  the  <b>logrotate</b>  config  files  are  listed  is  important.
       Normally,  a  single  config  file which includes any other config files which are needed should be used.
       See below for more information on how to use the <b>include</b> directive to accomplish this.  If a directory is
       given on the command line, every file in that directory is used as a config file.

       If no command line arguments are given, <b>logrotate</b> will print version  and  copyright  information,  along
       with  a  short usage summary.  If any errors occur while rotating logs, <b>logrotate</b> will exit with non-zero
       status, although the state file will be updated.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
              Tells <b>logrotate</b> to force the rotation, even if it doesn't think this is necessary.  Sometimes this
              is useful after adding new entries to a <b>logrotate</b> config file, or  if  old  log  files  have  been
              removed by hand, as the new files will be created, and logging will continue correctly.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
              Turn  on debug mode, which means that no changes are made to the logs and the <b>logrotate</b> state file
              is not updated.  Only debug messages are printed.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--state</b> <u>statefile</u>
              Tells <b>logrotate</b> to use an alternate state file.  This is useful if <b>logrotate</b> is  being  run  as  a
              different  user for various sets of log files.  To prevent parallel execution <b>logrotate</b> by default
              acquires a lock on the state file, if it cannot be acquired <b>logrotate</b> will exit with value 3.  The
              default state file is <u>/var/lib/logrotate/status</u>.  If <u>/dev/null</u> is given as the  state  file,  then
              <b>logrotate</b> will not try to lock or write the state file.

       <b>--skip-state-lock</b>
              Do not lock the state file, for example if locking is unsupported or prohibited.

       <b>--wait-for-state-lock</b>
              Wait until lock on the state file is released by another logrotate process.  This option may cause
              logrotate to wait indefinitely.  Use with caution.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Turns on verbose mode, for example to display messages during rotation.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--log</b> <u>file</u>
              Tells  <b>logrotate</b>  to log verbose output into the log_file.  The verbose output logged to that file
              is the same as when running <b>logrotate</b> with <b>-v</b> switch.   The  log  file  is  overwritten  on  every
              <b>logrotate</b> execution.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mail</b> <u>command</u>
              Tells  <b>logrotate</b> which command to use when mailing logs.  This command should accept the following
              arguments:

              1) the subject of the message given with '-s subject'
              2) the recipient.

              The command must then read a message on standard input and mail it to the recipient.  The  default
              mail command is <u>/usr/bin/mail</u>.

       <b>--usage</b>
              Prints a short usage message.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Prints help message.

       <b>--version</b>
              Display version information.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>logrotate</b>  reads  everything  about  the log files it should be handling from the series of configuration
       files specified on the command line.  Each configuration file can set global options  (local  definitions
       override  global  ones,  and  later  definitions  override  earlier ones) and specify logfiles to rotate.
       Global options do not affect preceding include directives.  A simple configuration file looks like this:

       # sample logrotate configuration file
       compress

       /var/log/messages {
           rotate 5
           weekly
           postrotate
               <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?killall">/usr/bin/killall</a> -HUP syslogd
           endscript
       }

       "/var/log/httpd/access.log" /var/log/httpd/error.log {
           rotate 5
           mail <a href="mailto:recipient@example.org">recipient@example.org</a>
           size 100k
           sharedscripts
           postrotate
               <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?killall">/usr/bin/killall</a> -HUP httpd
           endscript
       }

       /var/log/news/* {
           monthly
           rotate 2
           olddir /var/log/news/old
           missingok
           sharedscripts
           postrotate
               kill -HUP $(cat /var/run/inn.pid)
           endscript
           nocompress
       }

       <a href="file:~/log/">~/log/</a>*.log {}

       The first few lines set global options; in the example, logs are compressed after they are rotated.  Note
       that comments may appear anywhere in the config file as long as the first non-whitespace character on the
       line is a <b>#</b>.

       Values are separated from directives by whitespace and/or an optional =.  Numbers must be specified in  a
       format understood by <b><a href="../man3/strtoul.3.html">strtoul</a></b>(3).

       The  next  section of the config file defines how to handle the log file <u>/var/log/messages</u>.  The log will
       go through five weekly rotations before being removed.  After the log file has been rotated  (but  before
       the  old  version  of  the  log  has  been compressed), the command <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?killall">/usr/bin/killall</a></u> <u>-HUP</u> <u>syslogd</u> will be
       executed.

       The next section defines the parameters for both <u>/var/log/httpd/access.log</u> and  <u>/var/log/httpd/error.log</u>.
       Each  is  rotated  whenever  it  grows  over  100 kilobytes  in  size,  and the old logs files are mailed
       (uncompressed) to <a href="mailto:recipient@example.org">recipient@example.org</a> after going through 5 rotations, rather than being removed.   The
       <b>sharedscripts</b>  means that the <b>postrotate</b> script will only be run once for this section, not once for each
       log which is rotated.  Note that log file names may be enclosed in quotes (and that quotes  are  required
       if the name contains spaces).  Normal shell quoting rules apply, with <b>'</b>, <b>"</b>, and <b>\</b> characters supported.

       The  next section defines the parameters for all of the files in <u>/var/log/news</u>. Each file is rotated on a
       monthly basis.

       The last section uses tilde expansion to rotate log files in the home  directory  of  the  current  user.
       This is only available, if your glob library supports tilde expansion.  GNU glob does support this.

       Please  use  wildcards  with  caution.   If  you  specify  *,  <b>logrotate</b> will rotate all files, including
       previously rotated ones.  A way around this is to use the <b>olddir</b> directive or a more exact wildcard (such
       as *.log).

       Please  note,  by  default  when  using  <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1),  the  option  <u>ProtectSystem=full</u>  is  set   in   the
       <u>logrotate.service</u> file.  This prevents <b>logrotate</b> from modifying logs in <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></u>.

       Here is more information on the directives which may be included in a <b>logrotate</b> configuration file:

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b></h4><pre>
       These directives may be included in a <b>logrotate</b> configuration file:

   <b>Rotation</b>
       <b>rotate</b> <u>count</u>
              Log  files  are  rotated  <u>count</u> times before being removed or mailed to the address specified in a
              <b>mail</b> directive.  If <u>count</u> is 0, old versions are removed rather than rotated.  If <u>count</u> is -1, old
              logs are not removed at all, except they are affected by  <b>maxage</b>  (use  with  caution,  may  waste
              performance and disk space).  Default is 0.

       <b>olddir</b> <u>directory</u>
              Logs  are moved into <u>directory</u> for rotation.  The <u>directory</u> must be on the same physical device as
              the log file being rotated, unless <b>copy</b>, <b>copytruncate</b> or <b>renamecopy</b> option is used.  The <u>directory</u>
              is assumed to be relative to the directory holding the log file unless an absolute  path  name  is
              specified.  When this option is used all old versions of the log end up in <u>directory</u>.  This option
              may be overridden by the <b>noolddir</b> option.

       <b>noolddir</b>
              Logs are rotated in the directory they normally reside in (this overrides the <b>olddir</b> option).

       <b>su</b> <u>user</u> <u>group</u>
              Rotate log files set under this user and group instead of using default user/group (usually root).
              <u>user</u> specifies the user used for rotation and <u>group</u> specifies the group used for rotation (see the
              section  <b>USER</b> <b>AND</b> <b>GROUP</b> for details).  If the user/group you specify here does not have sufficient
              privilege to make files with the ownership you've specified in a <b>create</b> directive, it  will  cause
              an  error.   If  <b>logrotate</b> runs with root privileges, it is recommended to use the <b>su</b> directive to
              rotate files in directories that are directly or indirectly in control of non-privileged users.

   <b>Frequency</b>
       <b>hourly</b> Log files are rotated every hour.  Note that usually <b>logrotate</b> is configured to  be  run  by  cron
              daily  (or  by  <u>logrotate.timer</u> when using <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1)).  You have to change this configuration and
              run <b>logrotate</b> hourly to be able to really rotate logs hourly.

       <b>daily</b>  Log files are rotated every day.

       <b>weekly</b> [<u>weekday</u>]
              Log files are rotated once each <u>weekday</u>, or if the date is advanced by at least 7 days  since  the
              last  rotation  (while ignoring the exact time).  The <u>weekday</u> interpretation is following: 0 means
              Sunday, 1 means  Monday,  ...,  6  means  Saturday;  the  special  value  7  means  each  7  days,
              irrespectively of weekday.  Defaults to 0 if the <u>weekday</u> argument is omitted.

       <b>monthly</b>
              Log  files  are  rotated the first time <b>logrotate</b> is run in a month (this is normally on the first
              day of the month).

       <b>yearly</b> Log files are rotated if the current year is not the same as the last rotation.

       <b>size</b> <u>size</u>
              Log files are rotated only if they grow bigger than <u>size</u> bytes.  If <u>size</u> is  followed  by  <u>k</u>,  the
              size is assumed to be in kilobytes.  If <u>M</u> is used, the size is in megabytes, and if <u>G</u> is used, the
              size  is in gigabytes. So <u>size</u> <u>100</u>, <u>size</u> <u>100k</u>, <u>size</u> <u>100M</u> and <u>size</u> <u>100G</u> are all valid.  This option
              is mutually exclusive with the time interval options, and  it  causes  log  files  to  be  rotated
              without  regard  for  the  last  rotation  time,  if  specified  after the time criteria (the last
              specified option takes the precedence).

   <b>File</b> <b>selection</b>
       <b>missingok</b>
              If the log file is missing, go on to the next one without issuing  an  error  message.   See  also
              <b>nomissingok</b>.

       <b>nomissingok</b>
              If a log file does not exist, issue an error.  This is the default.

       <b>ignoreduplicates</b>
              Ignore any following matches of a log file.

       <b>ifempty</b>
              Rotate  the  log  file  even  if  it  is  empty,  overriding the <b>notifempty</b> option (<b>ifempty</b> is the
              default).

       <b>notifempty</b>
              Do not rotate the log if it is empty (this overrides the <b>ifempty</b> option).

       <b>minage</b> <u>count</u>
              Do not rotate logs which are less than &lt;count&gt; days old.

       <b>maxage</b> <u>count</u>
              Remove rotated logs older than &lt;count&gt; days.  The age is only checked if  the  logfile  is  to  be
              rotated.   <b>rotate</b>  <b>-1</b>  does not hinder removal.  The files are mailed to the configured address if
              <b>maillast</b> and <b>mail</b> are configured.

       <b>minsize</b> <u>size</u>
              Log files are rotated when they grow bigger than <u>size</u>  bytes,  but  not  before  the  additionally
              specified  time  interval (<b>daily</b>, <b>weekly</b>, <b>monthly</b>, or <b>yearly</b>).  The related <b>size</b> option is similar
              except that it is mutually exclusive with the time interval options, and it causes log files to be
              rotated without regard for the last rotation time, if specified after the time criteria (the  last
              specified  option  takes  the precedence).  When <b>minsize</b> is used, both the size and timestamp of a
              log file are considered.

       <b>maxsize</b> <u>size</u>
              Log files are rotated when they grow bigger than <u>size</u> bytes even before the additionally specified
              time interval (<b>daily</b>, <b>weekly</b>, <b>monthly</b>, or <b>yearly</b>).  The related <b>size</b> option is similar except that
              it is mutually exclusive with the time interval options, and it causes log  files  to  be  rotated
              without  regard  for  the  last  rotation  time,  if  specified  after the time criteria (the last
              specified option takes the precedence).  When <b>maxsize</b> is used, both the size and  timestamp  of  a
              log file are considered.

       <b>tabooext</b> [+] <u>list</u>
              The  current  taboo  extension  list  is changed (see the <b>include</b> directive for information on the
              taboo extensions).  If a + precedes the list of extensions, the current taboo  extension  list  is
              augmented,  otherwise  it  is  replaced.  At startup, the taboo extension list <u>,v</u>, <u>.bak</u>, <u>.cfsaved</u>,
              <u>.disabled</u>, <u>.dpkg-bak</u>, <u>.dpkg-del</u>, <u>.dpkg-dist</u>, <u>.dpkg-new</u>, <u>.dpkg-old</u>, <u>.dpkg-tmp</u>, <u>.new</u>,  <u>.old</u>,  <u>.orig</u>,
              <u>.rhn-cfg-tmp-*</u>, <u>.rpmnew</u>, <u>.rpmorig</u>, <u>.rpmsave</u>, <u>.swp</u>, <u>.ucf-dist</u>, <u>.ucf-new</u>, <u>.ucf-old</u>, <u>~</u>

       <b>taboopat</b> [+] <u>list</u>
              The  current  taboo glob pattern list is changed (see the <b>include</b> directive for information on the
              taboo extensions and patterns).  If a + precedes the list of patterns, the current  taboo  pattern
              list is augmented, otherwise it is replaced.  At startup, the taboo pattern list is empty.

   <b>Files</b> <b>and</b> <b>Folders</b>
       <b>create</b> <u>mode</u> <u>owner</u> <u>group</u>, <b>create</b> <u>owner</u> <u>group</u>
              Immediately after rotation (before the <b>postrotate</b> script is run) the log file is created (with the
              same  name  as the log file just rotated).  <u>mode</u> specifies the mode for the log file in octal (the
              same as <b><a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</a></b>(2)), <u>owner</u> specifies the user who will own the log file,  and  <u>group</u>  specifies  the
              group  the  log  file will belong to (see the section <b>USER</b> <b>AND</b> <b>GROUP</b> for details).  Any of the log
              file attributes may be omitted, in which case those attributes for the new file will use the  same
              values as the original log file for the omitted attributes.  This option can be disabled using the
              <b>nocreate</b> option.

       <b>nocreate</b>
              New log files are not created (this overrides the <b>create</b> option).

       <b>createolddir</b> <u>mode</u> [<u>owner</u> [<u>group</u>]], <b>createolddir</b> [<u>owner</u> [<u>group</u>]]
              If  the  directory specified by <b>olddir</b> directive does not exist, it is created. <u>mode</u> specifies the
              mode for the <b>olddir</b> directory in octal (the same as <b><a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</a></b>(2)), <u>owner</u> specifies the user  who  will
              own  the  <b>olddir</b> directory, and <u>group</u> specifies the group the <b>olddir</b> directory will belong to (see
              the section <b>USER</b> <b>AND</b> <b>GROUP</b> for details).  If <u>mode</u> is not specified, <b>0755</b> is assumed.  This  option
              can be disabled using the <b>nocreateolddir</b> option.

       <b>nocreateolddir</b>
              <b>olddir</b> directory is not created by <b>logrotate</b> when it does not exist.

       <b>copy</b>   Make  a  copy of the log file, but don't change the original at all.  This option can be used, for
              instance, to make a snapshot of the current log file, or when some other utility needs to truncate
              or parse the file.  When this option is used, the <b>create</b> option will have no effect,  as  the  old
              log  file  stays  in  place.   The  <b>copy</b>  option allows storing rotated log files on the different
              devices using <b>olddir</b> directive.

       <b>nocopy</b> Do not copy the original log file and leave it in place.  (this overrides the <b>copy</b> option).

       <b>copytruncate</b>
              Truncate the original log file to zero size in place after creating a copy, instead of moving  the
              old  log  file and optionally creating a new one.  It can be used when some program cannot be told
              to close its logfile and thus might continue writing (appending) to the previous log file forever.
              Note that there is a very small time slice between copying the file and  truncating  it,  so  some
              logging  data  might be lost.  When this option is used, the <b>create</b> option will have no effect, as
              the old log file stays in place.  The <b>copytruncate</b> option allows storing rotated log files on  the
              different devices using <b>olddir</b> directive.  The <b>copytruncate</b> option implies <b>norenamecopy</b>.

       <b>nocopytruncate</b>
              Do  not  truncate  the  original  log  file  in  place  after  creating a copy (this overrides the
              <b>copytruncate</b> option).

       <b>renamecopy</b>
              Log file is renamed to temporary filename in the same directory by adding ".tmp" extension to  it.
              After  that,  <b>postrotate</b>  script  is  run  and log file is copied from temporary filename to final
              filename.  In the end, temporary filename  is  removed.   The  <b>renamecopy</b>  option  allows  storing
              rotated  log files on the different devices using <b>olddir</b> directive.  The <b>renamecopy</b> option implies
              <b>nocopytruncate</b>.

       <b>norenamecopy</b>
              Do not rename and copy the original log file (this overrides the <b>renamecopy</b> option).

       <b>shred</b>  Delete log files using <b>shred</b> -u instead of  unlink().   This  should  ensure  that  logs  are  not
              readable after their scheduled deletion; this is off by default.  See also <b>noshred</b>.

       <b>noshred</b>
              Do not use <b>shred</b> when deleting old log files.  See also <b>shred</b>.

       <b>shredcycles</b> <u>count</u>
              Asks  GNU  <b><a href="../man1/shred.1.html">shred</a></b>(1)  to  overwrite  log  files  <b>count</b> times before deletion.  Without this option,
              <b>shred</b>'s default will be used.

       <b>allowhardlink</b>
              Rotate files with multiple hard links; this is off by default.  The target file might get emptied,
              e.g. with <b>shred</b> or <b>copytruncate</b>.  Use with caution, especially when the log files are  rotated  as
              root.

       <b>noallowhardlink</b>
              Do not rotate files with multiple hard links.  See also <b>allowhardlink</b>.

   <b>Compression</b>
       <b>compress</b>
              Old versions of log files are compressed with <b><a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a></b>(1) by default.  See also <b>nocompress</b>.

       <b>nocompress</b>
              Old versions of log files are not compressed.  See also <b>compress</b>.

       <b>compresscmd</b>
              Specifies which command to use to compress log files.  The default is <b><a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a></b>(1).  See also <b>compress</b>.

       <b>uncompresscmd</b>
              Specifies which command to use to uncompress log files.  The default is <b><a href="../man1/gunzip.1.html">gunzip</a></b>(1).

       <b>compressext</b>
              Specifies  which  extension to use on compressed logfiles, if compression is enabled.  The default
              follows that of the configured compression command.

       <b>compressoptions</b>
              Command line options may be passed to the compression program, if one is in use.  The default, for
              <b><a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a></b>(1), is "-6" (biased towards high compression  at  the  expense  of  speed).   If  you  use  a
              different compression command, you may need to change the <b>compressoptions</b> to match.

       <b>delaycompress</b>
              Postpone  compression  of  the previous log file to the next rotation cycle.  This only has effect
              when used in combination with <b>compress</b>.  It can be used when some program cannot be told to  close
              its logfile and thus might continue writing to the previous log file for some time.

       <b>nodelaycompress</b>
              Do  not  postpone  compression of the previous log file to the next rotation cycle (this overrides
              the <b>delaycompress</b> option).

   <b>Filenames</b>
       <b>extension</b> <u>ext</u>
              Log files with <u>ext</u> extension can keep  it  after  the  rotation.   If  compression  is  used,  the
              compression  extension  (normally  <u>.gz</u>)  appears  after <u>ext</u>.  For example you have a logfile named
              mylog.foo and want to rotate it to mylog.1.foo.gz instead of mylog.foo.1.gz.

       <b>addextension</b> <u>ext</u>
              Log files are given the final extension <u>ext</u> after rotation.  If the  original  file  already  ends
              with  <u>ext</u>, the extension is not duplicated, but merely moved to the end, that is both <b>filename</b> and
              <b>filename</b><u>ext</u> would get rotated to filename.1<u>ext</u>.  If compression is used, the compression extension
              (normally <b>.gz</b>) appears after <u>ext</u>.

       <b>start</b> <u>count</u>
              This is the number to use as the base for rotation.  For example, if you specify 0, the logs  will
              be created with a .0 extension as they are rotated from the original log files.  If you specify 9,
              log  files  will  be  created  with a .9, skipping 0–8.  Files will still be rotated the number of
              times specified with the <b>rotate</b> directive.

       <b>dateext</b>
              Archive old versions of log files adding a date extension like YYYYMMDD instead of simply adding a
              number.  The extension may be configured using the <b>dateformat</b> and <b>dateyesterday</b> options.

       <b>nodateext</b>
              Do not archive old versions of log files with date extension (this overrides the <b>dateext</b> option).

       <b>dateformat</b> <u>format_string</u>
              Specify the extension for <b>dateext</b> using the notation similar to <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3) function.  Only %Y  %m
              %d  %H  %M  %S  %V  %s and %z specifiers are allowed.  The default value is -%Y%m%d except hourly,
              which uses -%Y%m%d%H as default value.  Note that also the character separating log name from  the
              extension is part of the dateformat string.  The system clock must be set past Sep 9th 2001 for %s
              to  work  correctly.  Note that the datestamps generated by this format must be lexically sortable
              (that is first the year, then the  month  then  the  day.   For  example  2001/12/01  is  ok,  but
              01/12/2001  is  not,  since  01/11/2002 would sort lower while it is later).  This is because when
              using the <b>rotate</b> option, <b>logrotate</b> sorts all rotated filenames to  find  out  which  logfiles  are
              older and should be removed.

       <b>dateyesterday</b>
              Use  yesterday's  instead of today's date to create the <b>dateext</b> extension, so that the rotated log
              file has a date in its name that is the same as the timestamps within it.

       <b>datehourago</b>
              Use hour ago instead of current date to create the <b>dateext</b> extension, so that the rotated log file
              has a hour in its name that is the same as the timestamps within it.  Useful with rotate <b>hourly</b>.

   <b>Mail</b>
       <b>mail</b> <u>address</u>
              When a log is rotated out of existence, it is mailed to <u>address</u>.  If no mail should  be  generated
              by a particular log, the <b>nomail</b> directive may be used.

       <b>nomail</b> Do not mail old log files to any address.

       <b>mailfirst</b>
              When using the <b>mail</b> command, mail the just-rotated file, instead of the about-to-expire file.

       <b>maillast</b>
              When using the <b>mail</b> command, mail the about-to-expire file, instead of the just-rotated file (this
              is the default).

   <b>Additional</b> <b>config</b> <b>files</b>
       <b>include</b> <u>file_or_directory</u>
              Reads  the  file  given  as  an  argument as if it was included inline where the <b>include</b> directive
              appears.  If a directory is given, most of the files in that  directory  are  read  in  alphabetic
              order  before  processing  of  the including file continues.  The only files which are ignored are
              files which are not regular files (such as directories and named pipes) and files whose names  end
              with one of the taboo extensions or patterns, as specified by the <b>tabooext</b> or <b>taboopat</b> directives,
              respectively.   The  given path may start with <b>~/</b> to make it relative to the home directory of the
              executing user.  For security reasons configuration files must not be  group-writable  nor  world-
              writable.

   <b>Scripts</b>
       <b>sharedscripts</b>
              Normally,  <b>prerotate</b> and <b>postrotate</b> scripts are run for each log which is rotated and the absolute
              path to the log file is passed as first argument to the script.  That means a single script may be
              run multiple times for log file entries which match multiple files (such  as  the  <u>/var/log/news/*</u>
              example).   If  <b>sharedscripts</b> is specified, the scripts are only run once, no matter how many logs
              match the wildcarded pattern, and whole pattern is passed to them.  However, if none of  the  logs
              in  the  pattern  require  rotating, the scripts will not be run at all.  If the scripts exit with
              error (or any log fails to rotate), the remaining actions will not be executed for any logs.  This
              option overrides the <b>nosharedscripts</b> option.

       <b>nosharedscripts</b>
              Run <b>prerotate</b> and <b>postrotate</b> scripts for every log file which is rotated (this is the default, and
              overrides the <b>sharedscripts</b> option).  The absolute path  to  the  log  file  is  passed  as  first
              argument  to  the script.  The absolute path to the final rotated log file is passed as the second
              argument to the <b>postrotate</b> script.  If the scripts exit with error, the remaining actions will not
              be executed for the affected log only.

       <b>firstaction</b>
           <u>script</u>
       <b>endscript</b>
              The <u>script</u> is executed once before all log files that match the wildcarded  pattern  are  rotated,
              before  the  prerotate script is run and only if at least one log will actually be rotated.  These
              directives may only appear inside a log file definition.  The  whole  pattern  is  passed  to  the
              script  as  its  first argument. If the script exits with an error, no further processing is done.
              See also <b>lastaction</b> and the <b>SCRIPTS</b> section.

       <b>lastaction</b>
           <u>script</u>
       <b>endscript</b>
              The <u>script</u> is executed once after all log files that match the  wildcarded  pattern  are  rotated,
              after  the postrotate script is run and only if at least one log is rotated.  These directives may
              only appear inside a log file definition.  The whole pattern is passed to the script as its  first
              argument.   If the script exits with an error, just an error message is shown (as this is the last
              action).  See also <b>firstaction</b> and the <b>SCRIPTS</b> section.

       <b>prerotate</b>
           <u>script</u>
       <b>endscript</b>
              The <u>script</u> is executed before the log file and its old logs are rotated and only if the  log  will
              actually  be  rotated.   These directives may only appear inside a log file definition.  Normally,
              the absolute path to the log file is passed as the first argument to the script.  If <b>sharedscripts</b>
              is specified, the whole pattern is passed to the script.  See  also  <b>postrotate</b>  and  the  <b>SCRIPTS</b>
              section.  See <b>sharedscripts</b> and <b>nosharedscripts</b> for error handling.

       <b>postrotate</b>
           <u>script</u>
       <b>endscript</b>
              The  <u>script</u> is executed after the log file is rotated and before the log file is being compressed.
              These directives may only appear inside a log file definition.  Normally, the absolute path to the
              log file is passed as the first argument to the script and the absolute path to the final  rotated
              log file is passed as the second argument to the script.  If <b>sharedscripts</b> is specified, the whole
              pattern  is  passed  as the first argument to the script, and the second argument is omitted.  See
              also <b>prerotate</b> and the <b>SCRIPTS</b> section.  See <b>sharedscripts</b> and <b>nosharedscripts</b> for error handling.

       <b>preremove</b>
           <u>script</u>
       <b>endscript</b>
              The <u>script</u> is executed once just before removal of a log file.  <b>logrotate</b> will pass  the  name  of
              file which is soon to be removed as the first argument to the script. See also <b>firstaction</b> and the
              <b>SCRIPTS</b> section.

</pre><h4><b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
       The lines between the starting keyword (e.g. <b>prerotate</b>) and <b>endscript</b> (both of which must appear on lines
       by themselves) are executed (using <b><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></b>).  The script inherits some traits from the <b>logrotate</b> process,
       including  stderr, stdout, the current directory, the environment, and the umask.  Scripts are run as the
       invoking user and group, irrespective of any <b>su</b>  directive.   If  the  <b>--log</b>  flag  was  specified,  file
       descriptor 3 is the log file.  The current working directory is unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>USER</b> <b>AND</b> <b>GROUP</b></h4><pre>
       User and group identifiers are resolved first by trying the textual representation and, in case it fails,
       afterwards by the numeric value.
