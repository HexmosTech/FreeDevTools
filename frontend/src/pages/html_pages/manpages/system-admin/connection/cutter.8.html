</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cutter - cut tcp/ip connections

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cutter</b> <u>ipaddress1</u> [ <u>port1</u> [ <u>ipaddress2</u> [ <u>port2</u>  ]  ]  ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Cutter</b>  is  an  open source program that allows Linux firewall administrators to abort TCP/IP connections
       routed over the firewall or router on which it is run. it is not designed to work on the systems  hosting
       the  server  or  client  using the connection, it only works on a linux firewall or router over which the
       connection is made, and it must be run by the root user of the firewall.

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Cutter</b> has been designed for use as a administrators tool for  Linux  firewalls.  It's  use  (as  is,  or
       modified)  for  any  other  purpose  is  not  sanctioned  by  the  author. So - do not use this tool as a
       parachute, or to dry your cat, chill meat, answer your phone, drive you car, teach your kids to  read  or
       attack other people's computer systems or networks.

       This  software has been designed for <u>legal</u> and <u>appropriate</u> use by network security administrators and the
       like. It has been written as part of a larger Linux firewall project, targeting  at  controlling  traffic
       from  peer-to-peer  software such as Kazaa, iMesh and others into and out of a private network. It is not
       designed as a tool for malicious use and the author in no way sanctions such use.

       Users of the software should be aware that it's actions are easily detectable using a number  of  readily
       available  network  monitoring  tools, and it makes no attempt to disguise it's actions. Malicious use of
       "cutter" could result in a jail sentence in a number of countries around the world.

       <u>The</u> <u>author</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>responsible</u> for the results of using this software or documented  technique(whether  in
       it's  original  form,  or  modified).  It  is provided "as is" in the hope that it will be useful, but no
       guarantees are made about it's use.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Cutter</b> can be called using one of the following four syntaxes.

       <b>cutter</b> <u>ip-address</u>

       <b>Example:</b>
              <b>cutter</b> <u>10.10.0.45</u>

              Cuts all connections passing through the firewall between any ports on  the  specified  ip-address
              (either  a  "private" or "public" address) and any other hosts. This can be used to close down all
              incoming connections to a particular server, all outgoing connections from a particular client  or
              all outgoing connections to a server.

       <b>cutter</b> <u>ip-address</u> <u>port</u>

       <b>Example:</b>
              <b>cutter</b> <u>200.1.2.3</u> <u>80</u>

              Cuts  all  connections to or from the specified ip-address/port pair. This allows the user to be a
              little more specific than the previous example  and  allows  targeting  of  specific  services  on
              specific hosts.

       <b>cutter</b> <u>ip-address-1</u> <u>port-1</u> <u>ip-address-2</u>

       <b>Example:</b>
              <b>cutter</b> <u>200.1.2.3</u> <u>22</u> <u>10.10.0.45</u>

              Cuts  all  connections  between  ip-address-2 and ip-address-1/port-1. This allows the user to cut
              connections between a specified "client" and a particular service on a specified host. Our example
              closes host 10.10.0.45's SSH connection to server 200.1.2.3.

       <b>cutter</b> <u>ip-address-1</u> <u>port-1</u> <u>ip-address-2</u> <u>port-2</u>

       <b>Example:</b>
              <b>cutter</b> <u>200.1.2.3</u> <u>22</u> <u>10.10.0.45</u> <u>32451</u>

              Cuts the specific connection between the two ip/port number pairs given.

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       Cutter 1.04 should be considered <b>EXPERIMENTAL.</b>  The author is releasing a tool that works on the  systems
       which  he  has  access  to (namely: IPCop and RedHat Linux), and he is seeking input on it's use on other
       systems, ideas for improvement, offers of sponsorship - etc.
