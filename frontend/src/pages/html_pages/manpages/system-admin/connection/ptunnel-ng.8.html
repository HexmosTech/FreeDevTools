</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ptunnel-ng - tunnel TCP connections over ICMP echo request/reply packets.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ptunnel-ng</b> -p &lt;address&gt; -l &lt;port&gt; -r&lt;address&gt; -R&lt;port&gt; [-m &lt;magic&gt;] [-c &lt;connections&gt;] [-v &lt;level&gt;] [-L
       &lt;interface&gt;] [-o&lt;file&gt;] [-s] [-P &lt;password&gt;] [--udp] [--unprivileged] [-d&lt;pidfile&gt;] [-S] [-u&lt;user&gt;]
       [-g&lt;group&gt;] [-C&lt;directory&gt;] [-e&lt;context&gt;] [-h]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       PingTunnel-NG is a fork from the famous PingTunnel with the aim of an improved and refactored code base
       and some additional features.

       ptunnel is an application that allows you to reliably tunnel TCP connections to a remote host using ICMP
       echo request and reply packets, commonly known as ping requests and replies. At first glance, this might
       seem like a rather useless thing to do, but it can actually come in handy in some cases. The following
       example illustrates the main motivation in creating ptunnel:

       Setting: You're on the go, and stumble across an open wireless network. The network gives you an IP
       address, but won't let you send TCP or UDP packets out to the rest of the internet, for instance to check
       your mail. What to do? By chance, you discover that the network will allow you to ping any computer on
       the rest of the internet. With ptunnel, you can utilize this feature to check your mail, or do other
       things that require TCP.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Client</b> <b>options</b> <b>only:</b>

       <b>-p</b>
       <b>--proxy=</b><u>proxy_address</u>
              Specify the host on which the proxy is running.

       <b>-l</b>
       <b>--listen=</b><u>listen_port</u>
              Specifies the port on which the client will listen for incoming TCP connections.

       <b>-s</b>
       <b>--statistics</b>
              Enables continuous output of statistics (packet loss, etc.)

       <b>Server</b> <b>and</b> <b>Client</b> <b>options:</b>

       <b>-m</b>
       <b>--magic=</b><u>magic_value</u>
              Sets  a  different magic value which can be used to bypass Cisco's IPS. It may also work for other
              IDS/IPS/Firewalls.
              <b>Remember:</b> <b>This</b> <b>value</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>server</b> <b>and</b> <b>client!</b>

       <b>-r</b>
       <b>--remote-adr=</b><u>destination_addr</u>
              Specifies the address to which you want your packets tunneled after reaching  the  proxy  when  in
              client mode, or restricts the destination packets can be forwarded to when in server mode.

       <b>-R</b>
       <b>--remote-port=</b><u>destination_port</u>
              Specifies/restrict the port that the proxy should tunnel the TCP connection to.

       <b>-c</b>
       <b>--connections=</b><u>max_value</u>
              Set the maximum of concurrent tunnels.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbosity=</b><u>level</u>
              Controls the verbosity level. -1 is no output, 0 shows errors only, 1 shows info messages, 2 gives
              more  output,  3  provides  even  more  output,  level  4 displays debug info and level 5 displays
              absolutely everything, including the nasty details of sends and receives.

       <b>-L</b>
       <b>--libpcap=</b><u>network_device</u>
              Specify the network interface to capture packets from. Note that  packet  capturing  isn't  always
              necessary, but you should try this if you experience problems with ptunnel.

       <b>-o</b>
       <b>--logfile=</b><u>logfile</u>
              Specify a file to log to, rather than printing to standard out.

       <b>-P</b>
       <b>--passwd=</b><u>secret_password</u>
              Set  a  password  (must be same on client and proxy) which will be used for the challenge response
              authentication. The program will try to hide the password from `/proc/PID/cmdline` but it may  not
              work for ld wrapper or debugging/profiling tools like valgrind.

       <b>--udp</b>
              Enables  tunneling over UDP port 53 (DNS) instead of using ICMP. This will only work if your proxy
              can accept incoming traffic on port 53, and the client is able to send data to the proxy  on  port
              53.  Note that this option does not wrap ptunnel's data in DNS-compliant packets. This option must
              be given on both the proxy and client side for things to work correctly.

       <b>--unprivileged</b>
              Run proxy in unprivileged mode. This causes the proxy  to  forward  packets  using  standard  echo
              requests,  instead  of  crafting  custom  echo  replies.  Unprivileged mode will only work on some
              systems, and is in general less reliable than running in privileged mode.

       <b>-d</b>
       <b>--daemon=</b><u>pidfile</u>
              <b>(Not</b> <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>Windows.)</b>
              Run in background, writing PID to a pidfile.

       <b>-S</b>
       <b>--syslog</b>
              <b>(Not</b> <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>Windows.)</b>
              Changes logging to use the built-in syslog fascility.

       <b>-u</b>
       <b>--user=</b><u>username</u>
              <b>(Not</b> <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>Windows.)</b>
              When started in privileged mode (as root), drop down to user's rights as soon as possible.

       <b>-g</b>
       <b>--group=</b><u>groupname</u>
              <b>(Not</b> <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>Windows.)</b>
              When started in privileged mode (as root), drop down to group's rights as soon as possible. If you
              set <b>--user</b> it is not required to set this option too. The program will use  the  group  associated
              with that user.

       <b>-C</b>
       <b>--chroot=</b><u>directory</u>
              <b>(Not</b> <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>Windows.)</b>
              When started in privileged mode (as root), restrict file access to the specified directory.

       <b>-e</b>
       <b>--setcon=</b><u>context</u>
              <b>(Only</b> <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>Linux.)</b>
              Set  SELinux  context when all there is left to do are network I/O operations. In order to be able
              to combine with --chroot you will have to `mount --bind <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> /chrootdir/proc`.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b>
              Displays brief usage information.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following assumes that ptunnel is run  as  root,  both  on  the  proxy  and  client.  To  tunnel  ssh
       connections  from  the  client  machine  via  a  proxy  running  on  proxy.pingtunnel.com to the computer
       login.domain.com, the following command line would be used:
       <b>ptunnel</b> <b>-p</b> <b>proxy.pingtunnel.com</b> <b>-lp</b> <b>8000</b> <b>-da</b> <b>login.domain.com</b> <b>-dp</b> <b>22</b>
       An ssh connection to login.domain.com can now be established as follows:
       <b>ssh</b> <b>-p</b> <b>8000</b> <b>localhost</b>
       If ssh complains about potential man-in-the-middle attacks, simply remove  the  offending  key  from  the
       known_hosts  file.  The  warning/error  is  expected  if you have previously ssh'd to your local computer
       (i.e., ssh localhost), or you have used ptunnel to forward ssh connections to different hosts.

       Of  course,  for  all  of  this  to  work,  you  need  to  start  the  proxy   on   your   proxy-computer
       (proxy.pingtunnel.com). Doing this is very simple:

       <b>ptunnel</b>

       If  you  find  that the proxy isn't working, you will need to enable packet capturing on the main network
       device. Currently this device is assumed to be an ethernet-device (i.e., ethernet  or  wireless).  Packet
       capturing  is  enabled  by giving the -c switch, and supplying the device name to capture packets on (for
       instance eth0 or en1). The same goes for the client. On Mac OS X, packet capturing must always be enabled
       (both for proxy and client), as resent packets won't be received otherwise.

       To protect yourself from others using your proxy, you can protect access to it with a password using  the
       &lt;tt&gt;-x&lt;/tt&gt; switch. The password is never sent in the clear, but keep in mind that it may be visible from
       tools like top or ps, which can display the command line used to start an application.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ptunnel-ng</b>  does  only  exit  if  an  invalid  command  line  option is found or a fatal error during the
       initialisation process occurred. If this happens the exit value should always be non zero.   The  program
       does not exit until forced to do so by an external SIGNAL or if it crashes.
</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ptunnel-ng</b>  currently  does  not  handle  packet  capturing  on network interfaces other than ethernet or
       wireless correctly.
