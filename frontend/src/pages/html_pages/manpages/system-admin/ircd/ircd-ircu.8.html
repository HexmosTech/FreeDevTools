</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ircd-ircu - The Undernet Internet Relay Chat Daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ircd</b>   [-t] [-d directory] [-f configfile] [-x debuglevel] [-h hostname]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>ircd</u> is the Undernet Internet Relay Chat daemon.  <u>ircd</u> is a server in that its function is to "serve" the
       client  program <u><a href="../man1/irc.1.html">irc</a>(1)</u> with messages and commands.  All commands and user messages are passed directly to
       <u>ircd</u> for processing and relaying to other servers.  <u><a href="../man1/irc.1.html">irc</a>(1)</u>  depends  upon  there  being  an  <u>ircd</u>  server
       running somewhere for it to connect to and thus allow the user to begin talking to other users.

       There are many common clients including ircII, EPIC, and BitchX for UNIX, mIRC and pIRCh for Windows, and
       IRCle and Homer for the Macintosh.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> <b>directory</b>
              This  option  tells  the server to change to that directory and use that as a reference point when
              opening <u>ircd.conf</u> and other startup files.

       <b>-t</b>     Instructs the server run in the foreground and to direct debugging output to standard output.

       <b>-x#</b>    Defines the debug level for <u>ircd</u>. The higher the debug level, the more messages  get  directed  to
              debugging file (or standard output if the -t option is used).

       <b>-w</b> <b>interface</b>
              This  option  is  deprecated.  Outgoing connections are bound to the interface specified in the M:
              line, and incoming connections are accepted only on interfaces specified in the P: lines.

       <b>-f</b> <b>filename</b>
              Specifies the <u>ircd.conf</u> file to be used for this server.  The  option  is  used  to  override  the
              default <u>ircd.conf</u> given at compile time.

       <b>-c</b>     This  flag must be given if you are running <u>ircd</u> from <u>/dev/console</u> or any other situation where fd
              0 isn't a TTY and you want the server to fork off and run in the  background.  This  needs  to  be
              given if you are starting <u>ircd</u> from an <u>rc</u> (such as <u>/etc/rc.local</u>) file.

       <b>-h</b> <b>hostname</b>
              Allows   the   user   to   manually   set  the  server  name  at  startup.  The  default  name  is
              hostname.domainname.

       <b>-p</b> <b>portname</b>
              This is deprecated in favor of specifying server ports in P: lines.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       If you plan to connect your <u>ircd</u> server to an existing IRC network, you will need  to  alter  your  local
       <u>ircd</u>  configuration file (typically named <u>ircd.conf</u>) so that it will accept and make connections to other
       IRC servers.  This file contains the hostnames, network addresses, and passwords for connections to other
       IRC servers around the world.  Because the description of the <u>ircd.conf</u> file is beyond the scope of  this
       document, please refer to the INSTALL file in the <u>ircd</u> documentation directory.

       BOOTING THE SERVER:  The <u>ircd</u> server can be started as part of the UNIX boot procedure or just by placing
       the  server into Unix Background.  Keep in mind that if it is *not* part of your UNIXES Boot-up procedure
       then you will have to manually start the <u>ircd</u> server each time your UNIX is rebooted.  This means if your
       UNIX is prone to crashing or going for for repairs a lot it would make sense to start the <u>ircd</u> server  as
       part of your UNIX bootup procedure.  In some cases the <u><a href="../man1/irc.1.html">irc</a>(1)</u> will automatically attempt to boot the <u>ircd</u>
       server  if the user is on the SAME UNIX that the <u>ircd</u> is supposed to be running on.  If the <u><a href="../man1/irc.1.html">irc</a>(1)</u> cannot
       connect to the <u>ircd</u> server it will try to start the server on it's own and will then try to reconnect  to
       the newly booted <u>ircd</u> server.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
              tolsun% <b>ircd</b>

       Places <u>ircd</u> into UNIX Background and starts up the server for use.  Note:  You do not have to add the "&amp;"
       to this command, the program will automatically detach itself from tty.
