       ircd - The Internet Relay Chat Program Server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ircd</b>   [ <b>-abciqst</b> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>configfile</u> ] [ <b>-x</b> <u>debuglevel</u> ] [ <b>-h</b> <u>hostname</u> ] [ <b>-T</b> [ tunefile ] ] [ <b>-p</b> <u>mode</u> ]

       <b>ircd</b>   <b>-v</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>ircd</u>  is  the  server (daemon) program for the Internet Relay Chat Program.  The <u>ircd</u> is a server in that
       its function is to "serve" the client program <u><a href="../man1/irc.1.html">irc</a>(1)</u> with messages and commands.  All commands  and  user
       messages  are  passed  directly  to the <u>ircd</u> for processing and relaying to other ircd sites.  The <u><a href="../man1/irc.1.html">irc</a>(1)</u>
       program depends upon there being an <u>ircd</u> server running somewhere (either on your local UNIX  site  or  a
       remote  ircd  site) so that it will have somewhere to connect to and thus allow the user to begin talking
       to other users.

       <u>ircd</u> will reread its configuration file whenever it received a hangup signal, SIGHUP.

       Sending an interrupt signal to <u>ircd</u> process will cause it to restart.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>     Instructs the server to automatically die off if it loses all it's clients.

       <b>-b</b>     If the ircd.tune file is corrupted, by default the server will not start.  This option  will  make
              the server start anyways, with the default values (ignoring the corrupted file).

       <b>-c</b>     This  flag must be given if you are running ircd from <u>/dev/console</u> or any other situation where fd
              0 isnt a tty and you want the server to fork off and run in the background. This needs to be given
              if you are starting <u>ircd</u> from an <u>rc</u> (such as <u>/etc/rc.local</u>) file.

       <b>-i</b>     The server was started by inetd and it should start accepting connections from standard input. The
              following inetd.conf-line could be used to start up ircd automatically when needed:

       <b>ircd</b> <b>stream</b> <b>tcp</b> <b>wait</b> <b>irc</b> <b>/etc/ircd</b> <b>ircd</b> <b>-i</b>

              allows inetd to start up ircd on request.

       <b>-q</b>     Using this option stops the server from doing DNS lookups on all the  servers  in  your  <u>ircd.conf</u>
              file  when  it boots. This can take a lengthy amount of time if you have a large number of servers
              and they are not all close by.

       <b>-s</b>     When this option is specified, <u>iauth</u> will not be started.  This means that  the  IRC  daemon  will
              perform "ident lookups" (RFC 1413) internally to attempt to authenticate incoming connections.  No
              other authentication mechanism will be used.

       <b>-t</b>     Instructs the server to direct debugging output to standard output and to not fork nor detach from
              terminal.

       <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>
              Specifies  the  ircd.conf  file  to be used for this ircdaemon. The option is used to override the
              default ircd.conf given at compile time.

       <b>-x</b> <u>#</u>   Defines the debuglevel for ircd. The higher the  debuglevel,  the  more  stuff  gets  directed  to
              debugging file (or standard output if -t option was used as well).

       <b>-h</b> <u>hostname</u>
              Allows   the   user   to   manually   set  the  server  name  at  startup.  The  default  name  is
              hostname.domainname.

       <b>-p</b> <u>mode</u>
              Specify whether the server should enable built-in protections against various type of  user  abuse
              that  is  commonly  found on big public networks.  Possible modes are <b>strict</b> (default), <b>on</b> and <b>off</b>
              and <b>standalone</b>.  The <b>strict</b> option enables the protections, and refuses to establish a link  to  a
              server  not  running  with  this option.  This is useful to force all servers on an IRC network to
              enable them.  The <b>standalone</b> option removes split checks and disallows any server to connect.

       <b>-T</b> <u>tunefile</u>
              Specifies the ircd.tune file to be used for this ircdaemon. The option is  used  to  override  the
              default  ircd.tune  given  at  compile time. If no tune file is given, reading and writing of tune
              file is disabled.

       <b>-v</b>     This option prevents the server from starting,  and  dumps  some  information  about  the  version
              instead.

       <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>your</b> <u>ircd</u> <b>server</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>existing</b> <b>Irc-Network,</b>
              you  will need to alter your local IRC CONFIGURATION FILE (typically named "ircd.conf") so that it
              will accept and make connections to other <u>ircd</u> servers.  This file contains the hostnames, Network
              Addresses, and sometimes passwords for connections to  other  ircds  around  the  world.   Because
              description  of  the  actual  file  format  of  the  "ircd.conf"  file is beyond the scope of this
              document, please refer to the file INSTALL in the IRC source files documentation directory.

       BOOTING THE SERVER:  The <u>ircd</u> server can be started as part of the UNIX boot procedure or just by placing
       the server into Unix Background.  Keep in mind that if it is *not* part of your UNIXES Boot-up  procedure
       then you will have to manually start the <u>ircd</u> server each time your UNIX is rebooted.  This means if your
       UNIX  is prone to crashing or going for for repairs a lot it would make sense to start the <u>ircd</u> server as
       part of your UNIX bootup procedure.  In some cases the <u><a href="../man1/irc.1.html">irc</a>(1)</u> will automatically attempt to boot the <u>ircd</u>
       server if the user is on the SAME UNIX that the <u>ircd</u> is supposed to be running on.  If the <u><a href="../man1/irc.1.html">irc</a>(1)</u>  cannot
       connect  to the <u>ircd</u> server it will try to start the server on it's own and will then try to reconnect to
       the newly booted <u>ircd</u> server.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
              tolsun% <b>ircd</b>

       Places <u>ircd</u> into UNIX Background and starts up the server for use.  Note:  You do not have to add the "&amp;"
       to this command, the program will automatically detach itself from tty.

              tolsun% <b>ircd</b> <b>-v</b>
              ircd 2.9.3 AaCDEfFHiIkMsu_V1
                      zlib not used
                      Tue Apr 1 1997 at 20:17:50 EDT #1

       This indicates that this binary is the version 2.9.3 of the software.  AaCDEfFHiIkMsu_V1 are the  compile
       time  options which were used.  This binary does not support compression of server-server links (does not
       use zlib) and was compiled on April the 1st.
