</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       clone-outlet - Clone an UPS, treating its outlet as if it were an UPS (monitoring only)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>clone-outlet</b> -h

       <b>clone-outlet</b> -a <u>UPS_NAME</u> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]

           <b>Note</b>

           This man page only documents the specific features of the clone-outlet driver. For information about
           the core driver, see <b><a href="../man8/nutupsdrv.8.html">nutupsdrv</a></b>(8).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This driver, which sits on top of another driver’s local UNIX socket file (or Windows named pipe), allows
       users to group clients to a particular outlet of a device and deal with this output as if it were a
       normal UPS.

       Unlike the <b><a href="../man8/clone.8.html">clone</a></b>(8) driver or <b><a href="../man8/dummy-ups.8.html">dummy-ups</a></b>(8) driver running in repeater mode, this driver represents a
       read-only device for monitoring and shutdowns (it does not accept setting any values or sending instant
       commands during run time).

       Unlike <b><a href="../man8/dummy-ups.8.html">dummy-ups</a></b>(8) generally, this driver does not require a running upsd data server nor use the
       networked NUT protocol to talk to the "real" driver (which may be remote in case of dummy-ups repeater
       mode).

       This driver does not create a completely new virtual device, but replaces or extends some of the original
       readings reported by the "real" driver using information from the specified outlet, and relays all other
       readings as they were.

       Remote clients like upsmon can MONITOR the device entry presented by the data server with this driver
       (and the "real" driver) running and published.

       A larger deployment with one or more lower-priority devices collected on a manageable outlet of an UPS or
       ePDU would likely see several drivers set up on the system actually capable of interactions with the UPS
       and running the NUT data server <b><a href="../man8/upsd.8.html">upsd</a></b>(8) (and likely powered by another outlet):

       •   a "real" driver talking to the UPS;

       •   a clone driver talking to the "real" driver and issuing outlet power-off (or power-cycle) based on
           relatively high thresholds for remaining battery charge and/or runtime of the actual UPS (or explicit
           instant commands), with such operations first setting the respective timers for the outlet on the
           "real" driver, and the "FSD" flag among states of the virtual UPS status;

       •   possibly a clone-outlet driver which is read-only and interprets the outlet timer values as triggers
           for "FSD" or "OFF" flags reported among states of the virtual UPS status.

       With this approach, the lower-priority systems collected on such outlet would run the NUT <b><a href="../man8/upsmon.8.html">upsmon</a></b>(8)
       client to MONITOR the virtual UPS presented by the read-only clone-outlet driver and shut down as soon as
       the "FSD" flag is raised (fairly early, based on charge and/or runtime thresholds configured for that
       driver) allowing the higher-priority devices (likely including the NUT server) to enjoy a longer
       on-battery life.

       The clone driver responsible for outlet power state changes would not normally be monitored directly
       (e.g. to avoid unfortunate direct shutdown requests from those clients), although it can be (instead of
       clone-outlet) in sufficiently trusted networks.

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       This driver supports the following settings:

       <b>port</b>=<u>drivername-devicename</u>
           Required. The standard NUT driver port setting, here it provides the name of the local Unix socket
           (or named Windows pipe) for connection to the "real" driver.

       <b>prefix</b>=<u>outlet.N</u>
           Required. Specify the outlet prefix as known on the original driver. The subset of data points
           reported by the "real" UPS driver for the actual device on this prefix would be reported as data
           points of the virtual UPS maintained by this driver.

</pre><h4><b>IMPLEMENTATION</b></h4><pre>
       The port specification in the <b><a href="../man5/ups.conf.5.html">ups.conf</a></b>(5) should reference the local driver socket (or Windows named
       pipe) that the "real" UPS driver is using. For example:

             [realups]
                driver = usbhid-ups
                port = auto

             [clone-outlet-1]
                driver = clone-outlet
                port = usbhid-ups-realups
                prefix = outlet.1
                desc = "Outlet 1 of the Real UPS"
                [...]

       The driver internally interprets "real" driver’s information about shutdown delay and shutdown timer,
       whole UPS status and this outlet’s status, and relays other data points as they were.

       If the outlet supports and reports a delayed power-off, the virtual UPS would issue an FSD via ups.status
       for its clients to shut down safely.

       In more detail:

       Given the (required) prefix value such as outlet.1, the driver would specifically keep track of
       &lt;prefix&gt;.status, &lt;prefix&gt;.delay.shutdown, and &lt;prefix&gt;.timer.shutdown data points reported by the "real"
       driver. Numeric values of the *.shutdown readings would be noted by this driver, and the boolean outlet
       status ("off" or otherwise) will be remembered. These values will also be re-published by this driver "as
       is".

       The ups.status from the "real" driver would be remembered, but not re-published by this driver
       immediately. Instead, it would be published during regular "update info" loop cycles either:

       •   with the "OFF" state added (if &lt;prefix&gt;.status indicates the outlet is "off"),

       •   or with the "FSD" state prepended (if &lt;prefix&gt;.timer.shutdown is non-negative and does not exceed the
           &lt;prefix&gt;.delay.shutdown value),

       •   or "as is" if the outlet power state is "not critical".

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTANT</b></h4><pre>
       Unlike a real UPS, you should <b>not</b> configure a upsmon primary mode for this driver. When a <b><a href="../man8/upsmon.8.html">upsmon</a></b>(8)
       primary sees the OB LB flags and tells the <b><a href="../man8/upsd.8.html">upsd</a></b>(8) server it is OK to initiate the shutdown sequence, the
       server will latch the FSD status, and it will not be possible to restart the systems connected without
       restarting the upsd server.

       This will be a problem if the power returns after the clone UPS initiated the shutdown sequence on its
       outlet, but returns before the real UPS begins shutting down. The solution is in the clone driver, that
       will insert the FSD flag if needed without the help of an upsmon primary.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The clone UPS will follow the status on the real UPS driver. You can only make the clone UPS shutdown
       earlier than the real UPS driver, not later. If the real UPS driver initiates a shutdown, the
       clone-outlet UPS driver will immediately follow.

       Be aware that the commands to shutdown/restart an outlet on the real UPS drivers are not affected, so if
       you tell the real UPS driver to shutdown the outlet of the clone UPS driver immediately, your clients
       will lose power without warning. A delayed outlet power-off should propagate as FSD, and the delay should
       be sufficiently long to allow for client shutdowns.

       If you use service management frameworks like systemd or SMF to manage the dependencies between driver
       instances and other units, then you may have to set up special dependencies (e.g. with systemd "drop-in"
       snippet files) to queue your clone drivers to start after the "real" device drivers.

   <b>Dummy</b> <b>driver:</b>
       The "repeater" mode of <u>dummy-ups</u> driver is in some ways similar to the <u>clone</u> and <u>clone-outlet</u> drivers, by
       relaying information from a locally or remotely running "real" device driver (and NUT data server).
