</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pcs - pacemaker/corosync configuration system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pcs</b> [<u>-f</u> <u>file</u>] [<u>-h</u>] [<u>commands</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Control and configure pacemaker and corosync.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display usage and exit.

       <b>-f</b> file
              Perform actions on file instead of active CIB.
              Commands supporting the option use the initial state of the specified file as their input and then
              overwrite the file with the state reflecting the requested operation(s).
              A  few  commands  only  use  the  specified file in read-only mode since their effect is not a CIB
              modification.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Print all network traffic and external commands run.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print pcs version information. List pcs capabilities if <b>--full</b> is specified.

       <b>--request-timeout</b>=&lt;timeout&gt;

   <b>resource</b>
       [status [&lt;resource id | tag id&gt;] [node=&lt;node&gt;] [<b>--hide-inactive</b>]]
              Show status of all currently configured resources. If  <b>--hide-inactive</b>  is  specified,  only  show
              active resources. If a resource or tag id is specified, only show status of the specified resource
              or  resources in the specified tag. If node is specified, only show status of resources configured
              for the specified node.

       config [<b>--output-format</b> text|cmd|json] [&lt;resource id&gt;]...
              Show options of all currently configured resources or if  resource  ids  are  specified  show  the
              options for the specified resource ids. There are 3 formats of output available: 'cmd', 'json' and
              'text',  default  is  'text'.  Format  'text'  is a human friendly output. Format 'cmd' prints pcs
              commands which can be used to recreate the same configuration. Format 'json' is a machine oriented
              output of the configuration.

       list [filter] [<b>--nodesc</b>]
              Show list of all available resource agents (if  filter  is  provided  then  only  resource  agents
              matching  the  filter will be shown). If <b>--nodesc</b> is used then descriptions of resource agents are
              not printed.

       describe [&lt;standard&gt;:[&lt;provider&gt;:]]&lt;type&gt; [<b>--full</b>]
              Show options for the specified resource. If <b>--full</b> is specified, all  options  including  advanced
              and deprecated ones are shown.

       create &lt;resource id&gt; [&lt;standard&gt;:[&lt;provider&gt;:]]&lt;type&gt; [&lt;resource options&gt;] [<b>op</b> &lt;operation action&gt;
       &lt;operation options&gt; [&lt;operation action&gt; &lt;operation options&gt;]...] [<b>meta</b> &lt;meta options&gt;] [<b>clone</b> [&lt;clone
       id&gt;] [&lt;clone meta options&gt;] | <b>promotable</b> [&lt;clone id&gt;] [&lt;promotable meta options&gt;] | <b>--group</b> &lt;group id&gt;
       [<b>--before</b> &lt;resource id&gt; | <b>--after</b> &lt;resource id&gt;] | <b>bundle</b> &lt;bundle id&gt;] [<b>--disabled</b>] [<b>--agent-validation</b>]
       [<b>--no-default-ops</b>] [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
       create <b>--future</b> &lt;resource id&gt; [&lt;standard&gt;:[&lt;provider&gt;:]]&lt;type&gt; [&lt;resource options&gt;] [<b>op</b> &lt;operation
       action&gt; &lt;operation options&gt; [&lt;operation action&gt; &lt;operation options&gt;]...] [<b>meta</b> &lt;meta options&gt;] [<b>clone</b>
       [&lt;clone id&gt;] [<b>meta</b> &lt;clone meta options&gt;] | <b>promotable</b> [&lt;clone id&gt;] [<b>meta</b> &lt;promotable meta options&gt;] |
       <b>group</b> &lt;group id&gt; [<b>before</b> &lt;resource id&gt; | <b>after</b> &lt;resource id&gt;] | <b>bundle</b> &lt;bundle id&gt;] [<b>--disabled</b>]
       [<b>--agent-validation</b>] [<b>--no-default-ops</b>] [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Create specified resource.
              If  <b>clone</b> is used, a clone resource is created. If <b>promotable</b> is used, a promotable clone resource
              is created.
              If <b>--group</b> is specified, the resource is added to the group named. You can use <b>--before</b> or <b>--after</b>
              to specify the position of the added resource relatively to some resource already existing in  the
              group.
              If <b>bundle</b> is specified, resource will be created inside of the specified bundle.
              If <b>--disabled</b> is specified, the resource is not started automatically.
              If  <b>--agent-validation</b>  is  specified, resource agent validate-all action will be used to validate
              resource options and will prevent creating a misconfigured resource. If <b>--agent-validation</b> is  not
              specified,  the  validation  will be done anyway, but it will only produce warnings not preventing
              the resource from being created.
              If <b>--no-default-ops</b> is specified, only monitor operations are created for  the  resource  and  all
              other operations use default settings.
              If  <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resource to start and then return
              0 if the resource is started, or 1 if the resource has not yet started. If 'n' is not specified it
              defaults to 60 minutes.
              Specifying <b>--future</b> switches to the new command format that changes the way clone  and  promotable
              meta options are expected to be specified.

              Example:  Create  a  new  resource called 'VirtualIP' with IP address 192.168.0.99, netmask of 32,
              monitored everything 30 seconds, on eth2:
              pcs resource create VirtualIP ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 ip=192.168.0.99  cidr_netmask=32  nic=eth2  op
              monitor interval=30s

       delete &lt;resource id|group id|bundle id|clone id&gt;...
              Deletes  the  specified  resources,  groups,  bundles  or  clones  (and  all  resources within the
              groups/bundles/clones).

       remove &lt;resource id|group id|bundle id|clone id&gt;...
              Deletes the specified  resources,  groups,  bundles  or  clones  (and  all  resources  within  the
              groups/bundles/clones).

       enable &lt;resource id | tag id&gt;... [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Allow the cluster to start the resources. Depending on the rest of the configuration (constraints,
              options,  failures,  etc), the resources may remain stopped. If <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs will wait
              up to 'n' seconds for the resources to start and then return 0 if the resources are started, or  1
              if the resources have not yet started. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

       disable &lt;resource id | tag id&gt;... [<b>--safe</b> [<b>--brief</b>] [<b>--no-strict</b>]] [<b>--simulate</b> [<b>--brief</b>]] [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Attempt to stop the resources if they are running and forbid the cluster from starting them again.
              Depending  on  the  rest of the configuration (constraints, options, failures, etc), the resources
              may remain started.
              If <b>--safe</b> is specified, no changes to the  cluster  configuration  will  be  made  if  other  than
              specified  resources  would  be affected in any way. If <b>--brief</b> is also specified, only errors are
              printed.
              If <b>--no-strict</b> is specified, no changes to the cluster configuration will be made  if  other  than
              specified resources would get stopped or demoted. Moving resources between nodes is allowed.
              If <b>--simulate</b> is specified, no changes to the cluster configuration will be made and the effect of
              the  changes  will  be  printed  instead.  If  <b>--brief</b>  is also specified, only a list of affected
              resources not specified in the command will be printed.
              If <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resources to stop and then  return
              0  if the resources are stopped or 1 if the resources have not stopped. If 'n' is not specified it
              defaults to 60 minutes.

       safe-disable &lt;resource id | tag id&gt;... [<b>--brief</b>] [<b>--no-strict</b>] [<b>--simulate</b> [<b>--brief</b>]] [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
       [<b>--force</b>]
              Attempt to stop the resources if they are running and forbid the cluster from starting them again.
              Depending on the rest of the configuration (constraints, options, failures,  etc),  the  resources
              may  remain  started. No changes to the cluster configuration will be made if other than specified
              resources would be affected in any way.
              If <b>--brief</b> is specified, only errors are printed.
              If <b>--no-strict</b> is specified, no changes to the cluster configuration will be made  if  other  than
              specified resources would get stopped or demoted. Moving resources between nodes is allowed.
              If <b>--simulate</b> is specified, no changes to the cluster configuration will be made and the effect of
              the  changes  will  be  printed  instead.  If  <b>--brief</b>  is also specified, only a list of affected
              resources not specified in the command will be printed.
              If <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resources to stop and then  return
              0  if the resources are stopped or 1 if the resources have not stopped. If 'n' is not specified it
              defaults to 60 minutes.
              If <b>--force</b> is specified, checks for safe disable will be skipped.

       restart &lt;resource id&gt; [node] [<b>--wait</b>=n]
              Restart the resource specified. If a node is specified and if the resource is a clone or bundle it
              will be restarted only on the node specified. If <b>--wait</b> is specified, then we will wait up to  'n'
              seconds for the resource to be restarted and return 0 if the restart was successful or 1 if it was
              not.

       debug-start &lt;resource id&gt; [<b>--full</b>]
              This  command  will  force  the  specified  resource  to  start  on this node ignoring the cluster
              recommendations and print the output from starting the resource.   Using  <b>--full</b>  will  give  more
              detailed output.  This is mainly used for debugging resources that fail to start.

       debug-stop &lt;resource id&gt; [<b>--full</b>]
              This  command  will  force  the  specified  resource  to  stop  on  this node ignoring the cluster
              recommendations and print the output from stopping the resource.   Using  <b>--full</b>  will  give  more
              detailed output.  This is mainly used for debugging resources that fail to stop.

       debug-promote &lt;resource id&gt; [<b>--full</b>]
              This  command  will  force the specified resource to be promoted on this node ignoring the cluster
              recommendations and print the output from promoting the resource.  Using  <b>--full</b>  will  give  more
              detailed output.  This is mainly used for debugging resources that fail to promote.

       debug-demote &lt;resource id&gt; [<b>--full</b>]
              This  command  will  force  the specified resource to be demoted on this node ignoring the cluster
              recommendations and print the output from demoting the resource.   Using  <b>--full</b>  will  give  more
              detailed output.  This is mainly used for debugging resources that fail to demote.

       debug-monitor &lt;resource id&gt; [<b>--full</b>]
              This  command  will force the specified resource to be monitored on this node ignoring the cluster
              recommendations and print the output from monitoring the resource.  Using <b>--full</b>  will  give  more
              detailed output.  This is mainly used for debugging resources that fail to be monitored.

       move &lt;resource id&gt; [destination node] [<b>--promoted</b>] [<b>--strict</b>] [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Move  the  resource  off  the  node  it  is  currently  running on. This is achieved by creating a
              -INFINITY location constraint to ban the node. If destination node is specified the resource  will
              be  moved to that node by creating an INFINITY location constraint to prefer the destination node.
              The constraint needed for moving the resource will be automatically removed once the  resource  is
              running  on  its new location. The command will fail in case it is not possible to verify that the
              resource will not be moved back after deleting the constraint. If this happens after the  location
              constraint has been created, the constraint will be left in the configuration.

              If <b>--strict</b> is specified, the command will also fail if other resources would be affected.

              If  <b>--promoted</b>  is  used  the  scope of the command is limited to the Promoted role and promotable
              clone id must be used (instead of the resource id).

              If <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resource to move and then return 0
              on success or 1 on error. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

              NOTE: This command has been changed in pcs-0.11.  It  is  equivalent  to  command  'resource  move
              &lt;resource  id&gt;  <b>--autodelete</b>' from pcs-0.10.9. Legacy functionality of the 'resource move' command
              is still available as 'resource move-with-constraint &lt;resource id&gt;'.

              If you want the resource to preferably avoid running on some nodes but be able to failover to them
              use 'pcs constraint location avoids'.

       move-with-constraint &lt;resource id&gt; [destination node] [lifetime=&lt;lifetime&gt;] [<b>--promoted</b>] [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Move the resource off the node it is  currently  running  on  by  creating  a  -INFINITY  location
              constraint  to  ban  the node. If destination node is specified the resource will be moved to that
              node by creating an INFINITY location constraint to prefer the destination node.

              If lifetime is specified then the constraint will expire after that time, otherwise it defaults to
              infinity and the constraint can be cleared manually with 'pcs resource clear' or  'pcs  constraint
              delete'.    Lifetime    is    expected    to    be   specified   as   ISO   8601   duration   (see
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations).

              If <b>--promoted</b> is used the scope of the command is limited to  the  Promoted  role  and  promotable
              clone id must be used (instead of the resource id).

              If <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resource to move and then return 0
              on success or 1 on error. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

              If you want the resource to preferably avoid running on some nodes but be able to failover to them
              use 'pcs constraint location avoids'.

       ban &lt;resource id&gt; [node] [<b>--promoted</b>] [lifetime=&lt;lifetime&gt;] [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Prevent  the  resource id specified from running on the node (or on the current node it is running
              on if no node is specified) by creating a -INFINITY location constraint.

              If <b>--promoted</b> is used the scope of the command is limited to  the  Promoted  role  and  promotable
              clone id must be used (instead of the resource id).

              If lifetime is specified then the constraint will expire after that time, otherwise it defaults to
              infinity  and  the constraint can be cleared manually with 'pcs resource clear' or 'pcs constraint
              delete'.   Lifetime   is   expected   to   be   specified    as    ISO    8601    duration    (see
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations).

              If <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resource to move and then return 0
              on success or 1 on error. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

              If you want the resource to preferably avoid running on some nodes but be able to failover to them
              use 'pcs constraint location avoids'.

       clear &lt;resource id&gt; [node] [<b>--promoted</b>] [<b>--expired</b>] [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Remove constraints created by move and/or ban on the specified resource (and node if specified).

              If  <b>--promoted</b>  is  used  the  scope of the command is limited to the Promoted role and promotable
              clone id must be used (instead of the resource id).

              If <b>--expired</b> is specified, only constraints with expired lifetimes will be removed.

              If <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the  operation  to  finish  (including
              starting  and/or  moving  resources if appropriate) and then return 0 on success or 1 on error. If
              'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

       standards
              List available resource agent standards supported by this installation (OCF, LSB, etc.).

       providers
              List available OCF resource agent providers.

       agents [standard[:provider]]
              List available agents optionally filtered by standard and provider.

       update &lt;resource id&gt; [resource options] [op [&lt;operation action&gt; &lt;operation options&gt;]...] [meta &lt;meta
       options&gt;] [<b>--agent-validation</b>] [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Add, remove or change options of specified resource, clone or  multi-state  resource.  Unspecified
              options  will  be  kept  unchanged.  If  you wish to remove an option, set it to empty value, i.e.
              'option_name='.

              If an operation (op) is specified it will update the first found operation with the same action on
              the specified resource. If no operation with that action exists  then  a  new  operation  will  be
              created.  (WARNING: all existing options on the updated operation will be reset if not specified.)
              If you want to create multiple monitor operations you should  use  the  'op  add'  &amp;  'op  remove'
              commands.

              If  <b>--agent-validation</b>  is  specified, resource agent validate-all action will be used to validate
              resource options and will prevent creating a misconfigured resource. If <b>--agent-validation</b> is  not
              specified,  the  validation  will be done anyway, but it will only produce warnings not preventing
              the resource from being updated.

              If <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the changes to take  effect  and  then
              return 0 if the changes have been processed or 1 otherwise. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to
              60 minutes.

       op add &lt;resource id&gt; &lt;operation action&gt; [operation properties]
              Add operation for specified resource.

       op delete &lt;resource id&gt; &lt;operation action&gt; [&lt;operation properties&gt;...]
              Remove  specified  operation  (note:  you  must specify the exact operation properties to properly
              remove an existing operation).

       op delete &lt;operation id&gt;
              Remove the specified operation id.

       op remove &lt;resource id&gt; &lt;operation action&gt; [&lt;operation properties&gt;...]
              Remove specified operation (note: you must specify the  exact  operation  properties  to  properly
              remove an existing operation).

       op remove &lt;operation id&gt;
              Remove the specified operation id.

       op defaults [config] [<b>--all</b> | <b>--no-check-expired</b>] [<b>--full</b>] [<b>--output-format</b> text|cmd|json]
              List  currently configured default values for operations. If <b>--all</b> is specified, also list expired
              sets of values. If <b>--full</b> is specified, also list ids. If <b>--no-expire-check</b> is specified,  do  not
              evaluate  whether  sets  of  values  are  expired. There are 3 formats of output available: 'cmd',
              'json' and 'text', default is 'text'. Format 'text' is  a  human  friendly  output.  Format  'cmd'
              prints  pcs  commands  which  can  be  used to recreate the same configuration. Format 'json' is a
              machine oriented output of the configuration.

       op defaults &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;...
              Set default values for operations.
              NOTE: Defaults do not apply to resources / stonith devices which  override  them  with  their  own
              defined values.

       op defaults set create [&lt;set options&gt;] [meta [&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;]...] [rule [&lt;expression&gt;]]
              Create  a  new  set  of default values for resource / stonith device operations. You may specify a
              rule describing resources / stonith devices and / or operations to which the set applies.

              Set options are: id, score

              Expression looks like one of the following:
                op &lt;operation name&gt; [interval=&lt;interval&gt;]
                resource [&lt;standard&gt;]:[&lt;provider&gt;]:[&lt;type&gt;]
                defined|not_defined &lt;node attribute&gt;
                &lt;node attribute&gt; lt|gt|lte|gte|eq|ne [string|integer|number|version] &lt;value&gt;
                date gt|lt &lt;date&gt;
                date in_range [&lt;date&gt;] to &lt;date&gt;
                date in_range &lt;date&gt; to duration &lt;duration options&gt;
                date-spec &lt;date-spec options&gt;
                &lt;expression&gt; and|or &lt;expression&gt;
                (&lt;expression&gt;)

              You may specify all or any of 'standard', 'provider' and 'type'  in  a  resource  expression.  For
              example:  'resource  ocf::'  matches  all  resources  of  'ocf' standard, while 'resource ::Dummy'
              matches all resources of 'Dummy' type regardless of their standard and provider.

              Dates are expected to conform to ISO 8601 format.

              Duration options are: years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds. Value for these options
              is an integer.

              Date-spec options are: years, weekyears, months,  weeks,  yeardays,  monthdays,  weekdays,  hours,
              minutes, seconds. Value for these options is an integer or a range written as integer-integer.

              NOTE:  Defaults  do  not  apply  to resources / stonith devices which override them with their own
              defined values.

       op defaults set delete [&lt;set id&gt;]...
              Delete specified options sets.

       op defaults set remove [&lt;set id&gt;]...
              Delete specified options sets.

       op defaults set update &lt;set id&gt; [meta [&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;]...]
              Add, remove or change values in specified set of default values  for  resource  /  stonith  device
              operations. Unspecified options will be kept unchanged. If you wish to remove an option, set it to
              empty value, i.e. 'option_name='.

              NOTE:  Defaults  do  not  apply  to resources / stonith devices which override them with their own
              defined values.

       op defaults update &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;...
              Add, remove or change default values for operations. This is a simplified command useful for cases
              when you only manage one set of default values. Unspecified options will be kept unchanged. If you
              wish to remove an option, set it to empty value, i.e. 'option_name='.

              NOTE: Defaults do not apply to resources / stonith devices which  override  them  with  their  own
              defined values.

       meta &lt;resource id&gt; &lt;meta options&gt; [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Add  specified  options  to  the  specified  resource.  Meta  options  should  be in the format of
              name=value, options may be removed by setting an option without a value. If <b>--wait</b>  is  specified,
              pcs  will  wait  up to 'n' seconds for the changes to take effect and then return 0 if the changes
              have been processed or 1 otherwise. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
              Example: pcs resource meta TestResource failure-timeout=50 resource-stickiness=

       group list
              Show all currently configured resource groups and their resources.

       group add &lt;group id&gt; &lt;resource id&gt; [resource id] ... [resource id] [<b>--before</b> &lt;resource id&gt; | <b>--after</b>
       &lt;resource id&gt;] [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Add the specified resource to the group, creating the group if it does not exist. If the  resource
              is  present  in another group it is moved to the new group. If the group remains empty after move,
              it is deleted (for cloned groups, the clone is deleted as well). The delete operation may fail  in
              case the group is referenced within the configuration, e.g. by constraints. In that case, use 'pcs
              resource ungroup' command prior to moving all resources out of the group.

              You  can use <b>--before</b> or <b>--after</b> to specify the position of the added resources relatively to some
              resource already existing in the group. By adding resources to a group they  are  already  in  and
              specifying <b>--after</b> or <b>--before</b> you can move the resources in the group.

              If  <b>--wait</b>  is  specified,  pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including
              moving resources if appropriate) and then return 0 on success  or  1  on  error.  If  'n'  is  not
              specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

       group delete &lt;group id&gt; [resource id]... [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Remove  the  group (note: this does not remove any resources from the cluster) or if resources are
              specified, remove the specified resources from the group.  If <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs  will  wait
              up  to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including moving resources if appropriate) and the
              return 0 on success or 1 on error.  If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

       group remove &lt;group id&gt; [resource id]... [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Remove the group (note: this does not remove any resources from the cluster) or if  resources  are
              specified,  remove  the specified resources from the group.  If <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs will wait
              up to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including moving resources if appropriate) and  the
              return 0 on success or 1 on error.  If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

       ungroup &lt;group id&gt; [resource id]... [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Remove  the  group (note: this does not remove any resources from the cluster) or if resources are
              specified, remove the specified resources from the group.  If <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs  will  wait
              up  to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including moving resources if appropriate) and the
              return 0 on success or 1 on error.  If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

       clone &lt;resource id | group id&gt; [&lt;clone id&gt;] [meta &lt;clone meta options&gt;] [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Set up the specified resource or group as a clone. If <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n'
              seconds for the operation to finish (including starting clone instances if appropriate)  and  then
              return 0 on success or 1 on error. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

       promotable &lt;resource id | group id&gt; [&lt;clone id&gt;] [meta &lt;clone meta options&gt;] [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Set  up  the specified resource or group as a promotable clone. This is an alias for 'pcs resource
              clone &lt;resource id&gt; promotable=true'.

       unclone &lt;clone id | resource id | group id&gt; [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Remove the specified clone or the clone which  contains  the  specified  group  or  resource  (the
              resource  or  group  will not be removed). If <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds
              for the operation to finish (including stopping clone instances if appropriate) and then return  0
              on success or 1 on error. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

       bundle create &lt;bundle id&gt; container &lt;container type&gt; [&lt;container options&gt;] [network &lt;network options&gt;]
       [port-map &lt;port options&gt;]... [storage-map &lt;storage options&gt;]... [meta &lt;meta options&gt;] [<b>--disabled</b>]
       [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Create  a  new  bundle  encapsulating  no  resources.  The bundle can be used either as it is or a
              resource may be put into it at any time. If <b>--disabled</b> is specified, the  bundle  is  not  started
              automatically. If <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the bundle to start and
              then return 0 on success or 1 on error. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

       bundle reset &lt;bundle id&gt; [container &lt;container options&gt;] [network &lt;network options&gt;] [port-map &lt;port
       options&gt;]... [storage-map &lt;storage options&gt;]... [meta &lt;meta options&gt;] [<b>--disabled</b>] [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Configure  specified  bundle  with  given  options.  Unlike bundle update, this command resets the
              bundle according given options - no previous options are kept. Resources  inside  the  bundle  are
              kept  as  they are. If <b>--disabled</b> is specified, the bundle is not started automatically. If <b>--wait</b>
              is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the bundle to start and then return 0 on success
              or 1 on error. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

       bundle update &lt;bundle id&gt; [container &lt;container options&gt;] [network &lt;network options&gt;] [port-map (add
       &lt;port options&gt;) | (delete | remove &lt;id&gt;...)]... [storage-map (add &lt;storage options&gt;) | (delete | remove
       &lt;id&gt;...)]... [meta &lt;meta options&gt;] [<b>--wait</b>[=n]]
              Add, remove or change options of specified bundle. Unspecified options will be kept unchanged.  If
              you wish to remove an option, set it to empty value, i.e. 'option_name='.

              If you wish to update a resource encapsulated in the bundle, use the 'pcs resource update' command
              instead and specify the resource id.

              If  <b>--wait</b>  is  specified,  pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including
              moving resources if appropriate) and then return 0 on success  or  1  on  error.  If  'n'  is  not
              specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

       manage &lt;resource id | tag id&gt;... [<b>--monitor</b>]
              Set  resources  listed  to  managed  mode (default). If <b>--monitor</b> is specified, enable all monitor
              operations of the resources.

       unmanage &lt;resource id | tag id&gt;... [<b>--monitor</b>]
              Set resources listed to unmanaged mode. When a resource is in unmanaged mode, the cluster  is  not
              allowed  to start nor stop the resource. If <b>--monitor</b> is specified, disable all monitor operations
              of the resources.

       defaults [config] [<b>--all</b> | <b>--no-check-expired</b>] [<b>--full</b>] [<b>--output-format</b> text|cmd|json]
              List currently configured default values for resources / stonith devices. If <b>--all</b>  is  specified,
              also  list  expired sets of values. If <b>--full</b> is specified, also list ids. If <b>--no-expire-check</b> is
              specified, do not evaluate whether sets of values are expired.  There  are  3  formats  of  output
              available:  'cmd', 'json' and 'text', default is 'text'. Format 'text' is a human friendly output.
              Format 'cmd' prints pcs commands which can be used to  recreate  the  same  configuration.  Format
              'json' is a machine oriented output of the configuration.

       defaults &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;...
              Set default values for resources / stonith devices.
              NOTE:  Defaults  do  not  apply  to resources / stonith devices which override them with their own
              defined values.

       defaults set create [&lt;set options&gt;] [meta [&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;]...] [rule [&lt;expression&gt;]]
              Create a new set of default values for resources  /  stonith  devices.  You  may  specify  a  rule
              describing resources / stonith devices to which the set applies.

              Set options are: id, score

              Expression looks like one of the following:
                resource [&lt;standard&gt;]:[&lt;provider&gt;]:[&lt;type&gt;]
                date gt|lt &lt;date&gt;
                date in_range [&lt;date&gt;] to &lt;date&gt;
                date in_range &lt;date&gt; to duration &lt;duration options&gt;
                date-spec &lt;date-spec options&gt;
                &lt;expression&gt; and|or &lt;expression&gt;
                (&lt;expression&gt;)

              You  may  specify  all  or  any of 'standard', 'provider' and 'type' in a resource expression. For
              example: 'resource ocf::' matches all  resources  of  'ocf'  standard,  while  'resource  ::Dummy'
              matches all resources of 'Dummy' type regardless of their standard and provider.

              Dates are expected to conform to ISO 8601 format.

              Duration options are: years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds. Value for these options
              is an integer.

              Date-spec  options  are:  years,  weekyears,  months, weeks, yeardays, monthdays, weekdays, hours,
              minutes, seconds. Value for these options is an integer or a range written as integer-integer.

              NOTE: Defaults do not apply to resources / stonith devices which  override  them  with  their  own
              defined values.

       defaults set delete [&lt;set id&gt;]...
              Delete specified options sets.

       defaults set remove [&lt;set id&gt;]...
              Delete specified options sets.

       defaults set update &lt;set id&gt; [meta [&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;]...]
              Add,  remove  or change values in specified set of default values for resources / stonith devices.
              Unspecified options will be kept unchanged. If you wish to remove  an  option,  set  it  to  empty
              value, i.e. 'option_name='.

              NOTE:  Defaults  do  not  apply  to resources / stonith devices which override them with their own
              defined values.

       defaults update &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;...
              Add, remove or change default values for resources / stonith devices. This is a simplified command
              useful for cases when you only manage one set of default values. Unspecified options will be  kept
              unchanged. If you wish to remove an option, set it to empty value, i.e. 'option_name='.

              NOTE:  Defaults  do  not  apply  to resources / stonith devices which override them with their own
              defined values.

       cleanup [&lt;resource id | stonith id&gt;] [node=&lt;node&gt;] [operation=&lt;operation&gt; [interval=&lt;interval&gt;]]
       [<b>--strict</b>]
              Make the cluster forget failed operations from history  of  the  resource  /  stonith  device  and
              re-detect  its  current  state.  This  can be useful to purge knowledge of past failures that have
              since been resolved.

              If the named resource is part of a group, or one numbered instance of a clone or bundled resource,
              the clean-up applies to the whole collective resource unless <b>--strict</b> is given.

              If a resource id / stonith id is not specified then  all  resources  /  stonith  devices  will  be
              cleaned up.

              If a node is not specified then resources / stonith devices on all nodes will be cleaned up.

       refresh [&lt;resource id | stonith id&gt;] [node=&lt;node&gt;] [<b>--strict</b>]
              Make  the  cluster  forget  the  complete operation history (including failures) of the resource /
              stonith device and re-detect its current  state.  If  you  are  interested  in  forgetting  failed
              operations only, use the 'pcs resource cleanup' command.

              If the named resource is part of a group, or one numbered instance of a clone or bundled resource,
              the refresh applies to the whole collective resource unless <b>--strict</b> is given.

              If  a  resource  id  /  stonith  id  is not specified then all resources / stonith devices will be
              refreshed.

              If a node is not specified then resources / stonith devices on all nodes will be refreshed.

       failcount [show [&lt;resource id | stonith id&gt;] [node=&lt;node&gt;] [operation=&lt;operation&gt; [interval=&lt;interval&gt;]]]
       [<b>--full</b>]
              Show current failcount for resources and stonith devices, optionally  filtered  by  a  resource  /
              stonith device, node, operation and its interval. If <b>--full</b> is specified do not sum failcounts per
              resource  / stonith device and node. Use 'pcs resource cleanup' or 'pcs resource refresh' to reset
              failcounts.

       relocate dry-run [resource1] [resource2] ...
              The same as 'relocate run' but has no effect on the cluster.

       relocate run [resource1] [resource2] ...
              Relocate specified resources to their preferred nodes.  If no resources  are  specified,  relocate
              all  resources.   This  command  calculates  the  preferred  node for each resource while ignoring
              resource stickiness.  Then it creates location constraints which will cause the resources to  move
              to  their  preferred  nodes.   Once  the  resources  have  been  moved the constraints are deleted
              automatically.  Note that the preferred node  is  calculated  based  on  current  cluster  status,
              constraints, location of resources and other settings and thus it might change over time.

       relocate show
              Display current status of resources and their optimal node ignoring resource stickiness.

       relocate clear
              Remove all constraints created by the 'relocate run' command.

       utilization [&lt;resource id&gt; [&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt; ...]]
              Add  specified  utilization  options  to  specified  resource. If resource is not specified, shows
              utilization of all resources. If utilization options  are  not  specified,  shows  utilization  of
              specified  resource.  Utilization  option should be in format name=value, value has to be integer.
              Options may be removed by setting an option without a value.  Example:  pcs  resource  utilization
              TestResource  cpu=  ram=20   For  the  utilization configuration to be in effect, cluster property
              'placement-strategy' must be configured accordingly.

       relations &lt;resource id&gt; [<b>--full</b>]
              Display relations of a resource specified by its id with other  resources  in  a  tree  structure.
              Supported  types  of  resource  relations  are:  ordering  constraints,  ordering set constraints,
              relations defined by resource hierarchy (clones, groups, bundles). If <b>--full</b> is used, more verbose

       [<b>--no-keys-sync</b>]) | [<b>--corosync_conf</b> &lt;path&gt;]
              Create a cluster from the listed nodes and synchronize cluster configuration  files  to  them.  If
              <b>--corosync_conf</b>  is  specified,  do  not  connect  to  other  nodes  and save corosync.conf to the
              specified path; see 'Local only mode' below for details.

              Nodes are specified by their names and optionally their addresses. If no addresses  are  specified
              for a node, pcs will configure corosync to communicate with that node using an address provided in
              'pcs host auth' command. Otherwise, pcs will configure corosync to communicate with the node using
              the specified addresses.

              Transport knet:
              This is the default transport. It allows configuring traffic encryption and compression as well as
              using multiple addresses (links) for nodes.
              Transport options are: ip_version, knet_pmtud_interval, link_mode
              Link   options   are:   link_priority,   linknumber,   mcastport,  ping_interval,  ping_precision,
              ping_timeout, pong_count, transport (udp or sctp)
              Each 'link' followed by options sets options for one link in the order the links  are  defined  by
              nodes'  addresses. You can set link options for a subset of links using a linknumber. See examples
              below.
              Compression options are: level, model, threshold
              Crypto options are: cipher, hash, model
              By default, encryption is enabled with cipher=aes256 and hash=sha256. To disable  encryption,  set
              cipher=none and hash=none.

              Transports udp and udpu:
              These  transports  are limited to one address per node. They do not support traffic encryption nor
              compression.
              Transport options are: ip_version, netmtu
              Link options are: bindnetaddr, broadcast, mcastaddr, mcastport, ttl

              Totem and quorum can be configured regardless of used transport.
              Totem    options    are:    block_unlisted_ips,     consensus,     downcheck,     fail_recv_const,
              heartbeat_failures_allowed,  hold, join, max_messages, max_network_delay, merge, miss_count_const,
              send_join,      seqno_unchanged_const,      token,      token_coefficient,       token_retransmit,
              token_retransmits_before_loss_const, window_size
              Quorum options are: auto_tie_breaker, last_man_standing, last_man_standing_window, wait_for_all

              Transports  and  their  options, link, compression, crypto and totem options are all documented in
              <a href="../man5/corosync.conf.5.html">corosync.conf</a>(5) man page; knet link options are prefixed 'knet_' there, compression  options  are
              prefixed  'knet_compression_'  and  crypto  options  are  prefixed  'crypto_'.  Quorum options are
              documented in <a href="../man5/votequorum.5.html">votequorum</a>(5) man page.

              <b>--no-cluster-uuid</b> will not generate a unique ID for  the  cluster.  <b>--enable</b>  will  configure  the
              cluster  to  start  on  nodes boot. <b>--start</b> will start the cluster right after creating it. <b>--wait</b>
              will wait up to 'n' seconds for the cluster  to  start.  <b>--no-keys-sync</b>  will  skip  creating  and
              distributing  pcsd  SSL  certificate and key and corosync and pacemaker authkey files. Use this if
              you provide your own certificates and keys.

              Local only mode:
              By default, pcs connects to all specified nodes to verify they can be used in the new cluster  and
              to send cluster configuration files to them. If this is not what you want, specify <b>--corosync_conf</b>
              option  followed  by  a  file path. Pcs will save corosync.conf to the specified file and will not
              connect to cluster nodes. These are the tasks that pcs skips in that case:
              * make sure the nodes are not running or configured to run a cluster already
              * make sure cluster packages are installed on all nodes and their versions are compatible
              * make sure there are no cluster configuration files on any node (run 'pcs  cluster  destroy'  and
              remove pcs_settings.conf file on all nodes)
              *  synchronize  corosync  and pacemaker authkeys, /etc/corosync/authkey and /etc/pacemaker/authkey
              respectively, and the corosync.conf file
              * authenticate the cluster nodes against each  other  ('pcs  cluster  auth'  or  'pcs  host  auth'
              command)
              * synchronize pcsd certificates (so that pcs web UI can be used in an HA mode)

              Examples:
              Create a cluster with default settings:
                  pcs cluster setup newcluster node1 node2
              Create a cluster using two links:
                  pcs   cluster  setup  newcluster  node1  addr=10.0.1.11  addr=10.0.2.11  node2  addr=10.0.1.12
              addr=10.0.2.12
              Set link options for all links. Link options are matched to the links in  order.  The  first  link
              (link 0) has sctp transport, the second link (link 1) has mcastport 55405:
                  pcs   cluster  setup  newcluster  node1  addr=10.0.1.11  addr=10.0.2.11  node2  addr=10.0.1.12
              addr=10.0.2.12 transport knet link transport=sctp link mcastport=55405
              Set link options for the second and fourth links only. Link options are matched to the links based
              on the linknumber option (the first link is link 0):
                  pcs cluster setup newcluster node1 addr=10.0.1.11 addr=10.0.2.11 addr=10.0.3.11 addr=10.0.4.11
              node2 addr=10.0.1.12 addr=10.0.2.12 addr=10.0.3.12 addr=10.0.4.12 transport knet link linknumber=3
              mcastport=55405 link linknumber=1 transport=sctp
              Create a cluster using udp transport with a non-default port:
                  pcs cluster setup newcluster node1 node2 transport udp link mcastport=55405

       config [show] [<b>--output-format</b> text|cmd|json] [<b>--corosync_conf</b> &lt;path&gt;]
              Show cluster configuration. There are 3 formats of output available:  'cmd',  'json'  and  'text',
              default  is  'text'.  Format  'text'  is a human friendly output. Format 'cmd' prints pcs commands
              which can be used to recreate the same configuration. Format 'json' is a machine  oriented  output
              of  the  configuration. If <b>--corosync_conf</b> is specified, configuration file specified by &lt;path&gt; is
              used instead of the current cluster configuration.

       config update [transport &lt;transport options&gt;] [compression &lt;compression options&gt;] [crypto &lt;crypto
       options&gt;] [totem &lt;totem options&gt;] [<b>--corosync_conf</b> &lt;path&gt;]
              Update cluster configuration. Unspecified options will be kept unchanged. If you wish to remove an
              option, set it to empty value, i.e. 'option_name='.

              If <b>--corosync_conf</b> is specified, update cluster configuration in a file specified by &lt;path&gt;.

              All options are documented in <a href="../man5/corosync.conf.5.html">corosync.conf</a>(5) man page. There are different transport options for
              transport types. Compression and crypto options are  only  available  for  knet  transport.  Totem
              options can be set regardless of the transport type.
              Transport options for knet transport are: ip_version, knet_pmtud_interval, link_mode
              Transport options for udp and updu transports are: ip_version, netmtu
              Compression options are: level, model, threshold
              Crypto options are: cipher, hash, model
              Totem     options     are:     block_unlisted_ips,    consensus,    downcheck,    fail_recv_const,
              heartbeat_failures_allowed, hold, join, max_messages, max_network_delay, merge,  miss_count_const,
              send_join,       seqno_unchanged_const,      token,      token_coefficient,      token_retransmit,
              token_retransmits_before_loss_const, window_size

       config uuid generate [<b>--corosync_conf</b> &lt;path&gt;] [<b>--force</b>]
              Generate a new cluster UUID and distribute it to all cluster nodes. Cluster UUID is  not  used  by
              the  cluster stack in any way, it is provided to easily distinguish between multiple clusters in a
              multi-cluster environment since the cluster name does not have to be unique.

              If <b>--corosync_conf</b> is specified, update cluster configuration in file specified by &lt;path&gt;.

              If <b>--force</b> is specified, existing UUID will be overwritten.

       authkey corosync [&lt;path&gt;]
              Generate a new corosync authkey and distribute it to all cluster nodes. If &lt;path&gt; is specified, do
              not generate a key and use key from the file.

       start [<b>--all</b> | &lt;node&gt;... ] [<b>--wait</b>[=&lt;n&gt;]] [<b>--request-timeout</b>=&lt;seconds&gt;]
              Start a cluster on specified node(s). If no nodes are specified then start a cluster on the  local
              node.  If <b>--all</b> is specified then start a cluster on all nodes. If the cluster has many nodes then
              the start request may time out. In that case you should consider setting  <b>--request-timeout</b>  to  a
              suitable  value.  If <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs waits up to 'n' seconds for the cluster to get ready
              to provide services after the cluster has successfully started.

       stop [<b>--all</b> | &lt;node&gt;... ] [<b>--request-timeout</b>=&lt;seconds&gt;]
              Stop a cluster on specified node(s). If no nodes are specified then stop a cluster  on  the  local
              node.  If <b>--all</b> is specified then stop a cluster on all nodes. If the cluster is running resources
              which take long time to stop then the stop request may time out before the cluster actually stops.
              In that case you should consider setting <b>--request-timeout</b> to a suitable value.

       kill   Force corosync and pacemaker daemons to stop on the local node (performs kill -9). Note that  init
              system  (e.g.  systemd)  can detect that cluster is not running and start it again. If you want to
              stop cluster on a node, run pcs cluster stop on that node.

       enable [<b>--all</b> | &lt;node&gt;... ]
              Configure cluster to run on node boot on specified node(s). If node is not specified then  cluster
              is enabled on the local node. If <b>--all</b> is specified then cluster is enabled on all nodes.

       disable [<b>--all</b> | &lt;node&gt;... ]
              Configure  cluster  to  not  run  on node boot on specified node(s). If node is not specified then
              cluster is disabled on the local node. If <b>--all</b> is specified  then  cluster  is  disabled  on  all
              nodes.

       auth [<b>-u</b> &lt;username&gt;] [<b>-p</b> &lt;password&gt;]
              Authenticate pcs/pcsd to pcsd on nodes configured in the local cluster.

       status View current cluster status (an alias of 'pcs status cluster').

       rename Rename configured cluster. The cluster has to be stopped to complete this operation.

              Manual steps are needed in case the cluster uses GFS2 filesystem or DLM:
              for GFS2:
                   The  lock  table  name on each GFS2 filesystem must be updated to reflect the new name of the
              cluster so that the filesystems can be mounted.
              for DLM:
                   The DLM cluster name in the shared volume groups metadata must be updated so that the  volume
              groups can start.

       sync   Sync  cluster  configuration (files which are supported by all subcommands of this command) to all
              cluster nodes.

       sync corosync
              Sync corosync configuration to all nodes found from current corosync.conf file.

       cib [filename] [scope=&lt;scope&gt; | <b>--config</b>]
              Get the raw xml from the CIB (Cluster Information Base). If a filename is provided,  we  save  the
              CIB  to  that  file,  otherwise the CIB is printed. Specify scope to get a specific section of the
              CIB. Valid values of the scope are: acls, alerts, configuration, constraints, crm_config, fencing-
              topology,  nodes,  op_defaults,  resources,  rsc_defaults,  tags.  <b>--config</b>   is   the   same   as
              scope=configuration.  Do  not  specify a scope if you want to edit the saved CIB using pcs (pcs <b>-f</b>
              &lt;command&gt;).

       cib-push &lt;filename&gt; [<b>--wait</b>[=&lt;n&gt;]] [diff-against=&lt;filename_original&gt; | scope=&lt;scope&gt; | <b>--config</b>]
              Push the raw xml from &lt;filename&gt; to the CIB (Cluster Information Base). You can obtain the CIB  by
              running  the  'pcs  cluster cib' command, which is recommended first step when you want to perform
              desired modifications (pcs <b>-f</b> &lt;command&gt;) for the one-off push.
              If diff-against is specified, pcs diffs contents of filename against contents of filename_original
              and pushes the result to the CIB.
              Specify scope to push a specific section of the CIB. Valid values of the scope are: acls,  alerts,
              configuration,   constraints,   crm_config,   fencing-topology,   nodes,  op_defaults,  resources,
              rsc_defaults, tags. <b>--config</b> is the same as scope=configuration. Use of <b>--config</b>  is  recommended.
              Do not specify a scope if you need to push the whole CIB or be warned in the case of outdated CIB.
              If <b>--wait</b> is specified wait up to 'n' seconds for changes to be applied.
              <b>WARNING:</b> the selected scope of the CIB will be overwritten by the current content of the specified
              file.

              Example:
                  pcs cluster cib &gt; original.xml
                  cp original.xml new.xml
                  pcs -f new.xml constraint location apache prefers node2
                  pcs cluster cib-push new.xml diff-against=original.xml

       cib-upgrade
              Upgrade the CIB to conform to the latest version of the document schema.

       edit [scope=&lt;scope&gt; | <b>--config</b>]
              Edit  the cib in the editor specified by the $EDITOR environment variable and push out any changes
              upon saving. Specify scope to edit a specific section of the CIB. Valid values of the  scope  are:
              acls,  alerts,  configuration,  constraints,  crm_config,  fencing-topology,  nodes,  op_defaults,
              resources, rsc_defaults, tags. <b>--config</b> is the same as scope=configuration.  Use  of  <b>--config</b>  is
              recommended.  Do not specify a scope if you need to edit the whole CIB or be warned in the case of
              outdated CIB.

       node add &lt;node name&gt; [addr=&lt;node address&gt;]... [watchdog=&lt;watchdog path&gt;] [device=&lt;SBD device path&gt;]...
       [<b>--start</b> [<b>--wait</b>[=&lt;n&gt;]]] [<b>--enable]</b> <b>[--no-watchdog-validation</b>]
              Add the node to the cluster and synchronize all relevant configuration files to the new node. This
              command can only be run on an existing cluster node.

              The new node is specified by its name and optionally its addresses. If no addresses are  specified
              for  the  node, pcs will configure corosync to communicate with the node using an address provided
              in 'pcs host auth' command. Otherwise, pcs will configure corosync to communicate  with  the  node
              using the specified addresses.

              Use  'watchdog'  to  specify  a  path  to  a  watchdog on the new node, when SBD is enabled in the
              cluster. If SBD is configured with  shared  storage,  use  'device'  to  specify  path  to  shared
              device(s) on the new node.

              If  <b>--start</b> is specified also start cluster on the new node, if <b>--wait</b> is specified wait up to 'n'
              seconds for the new node to start. If <b>--enable</b> is specified configure cluster to start on the  new
              node on boot. If <b>--no-watchdog-validation</b> is specified, validation of watchdog will be skipped.

              <b>WARNING:</b>  <b>By</b>  <b>default,</b>  <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>tested</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>specified</b> <b>watchdog</b> <b>is</b> <b>supported.</b> <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>cause</b> <b>a</b>
              <b>restart</b>  <b>of</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>system</b>  <b>when</b>  <b>a</b>  <b>watchdog</b>  <b>with</b>  <b>no-way-out-feature</b>  <b>enabled</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>present.</b>   <b>Use</b>

       node delete &lt;node name&gt; [&lt;node name&gt;]...
              Shutdown specified nodes and remove them from the cluster.

       node remove &lt;node name&gt; [&lt;node name&gt;]...
              Shutdown specified nodes and remove them from the cluster.

       node add-remote &lt;node name&gt; [&lt;node address&gt;] [options] [op &lt;operation action&gt; &lt;operation options&gt;
       [&lt;operation action&gt; &lt;operation options&gt;]...] [meta &lt;meta options&gt;] [<b>--wait</b>[=&lt;n&gt;]]
              Add  the  node  to  the cluster as a remote node. Sync all relevant configuration files to the new
              node. Start the node and configure it  to  start  the  cluster  on  boot.  Options  are  port  and
              reconnect_interval.   Operations   and   meta   belong   to   an  underlying  connection  resource
              (ocf:pacemaker:remote). If node address  is  not  specified  for  the  node,  pcs  will  configure
              pacemaker  to  communicate  with  the  node  using an address provided in 'pcs host auth' command.
              Otherwise, pcs will  configure  pacemaker  to  communicate  with  the  node  using  the  specified
              addresses. If <b>--wait</b> is specified, wait up to 'n' seconds for the node to start.

       node delete-remote &lt;node identifier&gt;
              Shutdown specified remote node and remove it from the cluster. The node-identifier can be the name
              of the node or the address of the node.

       node remove-remote &lt;node identifier&gt;
              Shutdown specified remote node and remove it from the cluster. The node-identifier can be the name
              of the node or the address of the node.

       node add-guest &lt;node name&gt; &lt;resource id&gt; [options] [<b>--wait</b>[=&lt;n&gt;]]
              Make  the  specified  resource a guest node resource. Sync all relevant configuration files to the
              new node. Start the node and configure it to start the cluster on boot. Options  are  remote-addr,
              remote-port  and  remote-connect-timeout.  If  remote-addr is not specified for the node, pcs will
              configure pacemaker to communicate with the node using an address  provided  in  'pcs  host  auth'
              command.  Otherwise, pcs will configure pacemaker to communicate with the node using the specified
              addresses. If <b>--wait</b> is specified, wait up to 'n' seconds for the node to start.

       node delete-guest &lt;node identifier&gt;
              Shutdown specified guest node and remove it from the cluster. The node-identifier can be the  name
              of the node or the address of the node or id of the resource that is used as the guest node.

       node remove-guest &lt;node identifier&gt;
              Shutdown  specified guest node and remove it from the cluster. The node-identifier can be the name
              of the node or the address of the node or id of the resource that is used as the guest node.

       node clear &lt;node name&gt;

       destroy [<b>--all</b>] [<b>--yes</b>]
              Permanently destroy the cluster on the current node, killing all cluster  processes  and  removing
              all  cluster  configuration files. Using <b>--all</b> will attempt to destroy the cluster on all nodes in
              the local cluster.

              <b>WARNING:</b> This command permanently removes any cluster configuration that has been created.  It  is
              recommended to run 'pcs cluster stop' before destroying the cluster. To prevent accidental running
              of this command, <b>--yes</b> or interactive user response is required in order to proceed.

       verify [<b>--full</b>] [<b>-f</b> &lt;filename&gt;]
              Checks  the  pacemaker configuration (CIB) for syntax and common conceptual errors. If no filename
              is specified the check is performed on the currently running  cluster.  If  <b>--full</b>  is  used  more
              verbose output will be printed.

       report [<b>--from</b> "YYYY-M-D H:M:S" [<b>--to</b> "YYYY-M-D H:M:S"]] &lt;dest&gt; [<b>--overwrite]</b>
              Create  a tarball containing everything needed when reporting cluster problems. If <b>--from</b> and <b>--to</b>
              are not used, the report will include the past 24 hours. No existing files  will  be  overwritten,
              unless <b>--overwrite</b> is specified.

              Show  status  of  all  currently configured stonith devices. If <b>--hide-inactive</b> is specified, only
              show active stonith devices. If a resource or tag  id  is  specified,  only  show  status  of  the
              specified  resource  or  resources in the specified tag. If node is specified, only show status of
              resources configured for the specified node.

       config [<b>--output-format</b> text|cmd|json] [&lt;stonith id&gt;]...
              Show options of all currently configured stonith devices or if stonith device  ids  are  specified
              show  the  options  for the specified stonith device ids. There are 3 formats of output available:
              'cmd', 'json' and 'text', default is 'text'. Format 'text' is  a  human  friendly  output.  Format
              'cmd' prints pcs commands which can be used to recreate the same configuration. Format 'json' is a
              machine oriented output of the configuration.

              Note:  The  'json'  output  format  does not include fencing levels. Use 'pcs stonith level config
              --output-format=json' to get fencing levels.

       list [filter] [<b>--nodesc</b>]
              Show list of all available stonith agents (if filter is provided then only stonith agents matching
              the filter will be shown). If <b>--nodesc</b> is  used  then  descriptions  of  stonith  agents  are  not
              printed.

       describe &lt;stonith agent&gt; [<b>--full</b>]
              Show  options  for specified stonith agent. If <b>--full</b> is specified, all options including advanced

              Create stonith device with specified type and options.
              If<b>--disabled</b> is specified the stonith device is not used.
              If <b>--agent-validation</b> is specified, stonith agent validate-all action will  be  used  to  validate
              stonith   device   options   and   will  prevent  creating  a  misconfigured  stonith  device.  If
              <b>--agent-validation</b> is not specified, the validation will be done anyway, but it will only  produce
              warnings not preventing the stonith device from being created.
              If  <b>--wait</b>  is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the stonith device to start and then
              return 0 if the stonith device is started, or 1 if the stonith device has not yet started. If  'n'
              is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

              Example: Create a device for nodes node1 and node2
              pcs stonith create MyFence fence_virt pcmk_host_list=node1,node2

              Add,  remove  or  change  options  of  specified  stonith device. Unspecified options will be kept
              unchanged. If you wish to remove an option, set it to empty value, i.e. 'option_name='.

              If an operation (op) is specified it will update the first found operation with the same action on
              the specified stonith device. If no operation with that action exists then a new operation will be
              created. (WARNING: all existing options on the updated operation will be reset if not  specified.)
              If  you  want  to  create  multiple  monitor  operations you should use the 'op add' &amp; 'op remove'
              commands.

              If <b>--agent-validation</b> is specified, stonith agent validate-all action will  be  used  to  validate

              <b>--agent-validation</b> is not specified, the validation will be done anyway, but it will only  produce
              warnings not preventing the stonith device from being updated.

              If  <b>--wait</b>  is  specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the changes to take effect and then
              return 0 if the changes have been processed or 1 otherwise. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to

              the clean-up applies to the whole collective resource unless <b>--strict</b> is given.

              If  a  resource  id  /  stonith  id  is not specified then all resources / stonith devices will be
              cleaned up.

              If a node is not specified then resources / stonith devices on all nodes will be cleaned up.

       refresh [&lt;resource id | stonith id&gt;] [node=&lt;node&gt;] [<b>--strict</b>]
              This command is an alias of 'resource refresh' command.

              Make the cluster forget the complete operation history (including  failures)  of  the  resource  /
              stonith  device  and  re-detect  its  current  state.  If  you are interested in forgetting failed
              operations only, use the 'pcs resource cleanup' command.

              If the named resource is part of a group, or one numbered instance of a clone or bundled resource,
              the refresh applies to the whole collective resource unless <b>--strict</b> is given.

              If a resource id / stonith id is not specified then  all  resources  /  stonith  devices  will  be
              refreshed.

              If a node is not specified then resources / stonith devices on all nodes will be refreshed.

       failcount [show [&lt;resource id | stonith id&gt;] [node=&lt;node&gt;] [operation=&lt;operation&gt; [interval=&lt;interval&gt;]]]
       [<b>--full</b>]
              This command is an alias of 'resource failcount show' command.

              Show  current  failcount  for  resources  and stonith devices, optionally filtered by a resource /
              stonith device, node, operation and its interval. If <b>--full</b> is specified do not sum failcounts per
              resource / stonith device and node. Use 'pcs resource cleanup' or 'pcs resource refresh' to  reset
              failcounts.

       enable &lt;stonith id&gt;... [<b>--wait[=n]</b>]
              Allow  the  cluster  to  use  the stonith devices. If <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n'
              seconds for the stonith devices to start and then return 0 if the stonith devices are started,  or
              1 if the stonith devices have not yet started. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

       disable &lt;stonith id&gt;... [<b>--wait[=n]</b>]
              Attempt  to  stop the stonith devices if they are running and disallow the cluster to use them. If
              <b>--wait</b> is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the stonith  devices  to  stop  and  then
              return  0  if the stonith devices are stopped or 1 if the stonith devices have not stopped. If 'n'
              is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

       level [config] [<b>--output-format</b> text|cmd|json]
              Lists all of the fencing levels currently configured. There are 3  formats  of  output  available:
              'cmd',  'json'  and  'text',  default  is 'text'. Format 'text' is a human friendly output. Format
              'cmd' prints pcs commands which can be used to recreate the same configuration. Format 'json' is a
              machine oriented output of the configuration.

       level add &lt;level&gt; &lt;target&gt; &lt;stonith id&gt; [&lt;stonith id&gt;...] [id=&lt;level id&gt;]
              Add the fencing level for the specified target with the list of stonith  devices  to  attempt  for
              that  target  at that level. Fence levels are attempted in numerical order (starting with 1). If a
              level succeeds (meaning all devices are successfully fenced in that level) then  no  other  levels
              are  tried,  and  the  target  is  considered  fenced.  Target  may  be a node name &lt;node_name&gt; or
              %&lt;node_name&gt; or node%&lt;node_name&gt;, a node name regular expression regexp%&lt;node_pattern&gt; or  a  node
              attribute value attrib%&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;. Id for the fencing level will be generated if not specified
              by the id option.

       level delete &lt;level&gt; [target &lt;target&gt;] [stonith &lt;stonith id&gt;...]
              Removes  the  fence  level for the level, target and/or devices specified. If no target or devices
              are specified then the fence  level  is  removed.  Target  may  be  a  node  name  &lt;node_name&gt;  or
              %&lt;node_name&gt;  or  node%&lt;node_name&gt;, a node name regular expression regexp%&lt;node_pattern&gt; or a node

       level remove &lt;level&gt; [target &lt;target&gt;] [stonith &lt;stonith id&gt;...]
              Removes the fence level for the level, target and/or devices specified. If no  target  or  devices
              are  specified  then  the  fence  level  is  removed.  Target  may  be  a node name &lt;node_name&gt; or
              %&lt;node_name&gt; or node%&lt;node_name&gt;, a node name regular expression regexp%&lt;node_pattern&gt; or  a  node
              attribute value attrib%&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;.

       level clear [target &lt;target&gt; | stonith &lt;stonith id&gt;...]
              Clears  the  fence  levels on the target (or stonith id) specified or clears all fence levels if a
              target/stonith id is not specified. Target may be a  node  name  &lt;node_name&gt;  or  %&lt;node_name&gt;  or

       level verify
              Verifies all fence devices and nodes specified in fence levels exist.

       fence &lt;node&gt; [<b>--off</b>]
              Fence the node specified (if <b>--off</b> is specified, use the 'off' API call to stonith which will turn
              the node off instead of rebooting it).

       confirm &lt;node&gt; [<b>--yes</b>]
              Confirm to the cluster that the specified node is powered off. This allows the cluster to  recover
              from  a  situation  where no stonith device is able to fence the node. This command should <b>ONLY</b> be
              used after manually ensuring that the node is powered off and has no access to shared resources.

              <b>WARNING:</b> <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>node</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> <b>powered</b> <b>off</b> <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>shared</b> <b>resources,</b> <b>data</b>

       role create &lt;role id&gt; [description=&lt;description&gt;] [((read | write | deny) (xpath &lt;query&gt; | id &lt;id&gt;))...]
              Create a role with the id and (optional)  description  specified.  Each  role  can  also  have  an
              unlimited  number of permissions (read/write/deny) applied to either an xpath query or the id of a
              specific element in the cib.
              Permissions are applied to the selected XML element's entire XML subtree  (all  elements  enclosed
              within  it).  Write permission grants the ability to create, modify, or remove the element and its
              subtree, and also the ability to create any "scaffolding" elements (enclosing elements that do not
              have attributes other than an ID). Permissions for  more  specific  matches  (more  deeply  nested
              elements)  take  precedence over more general ones. If multiple permissions are configured for the
              same match (for example, in different roles applied to the same user), any deny  permission  takes
              precedence, then write, then lastly read.
              An  xpath  may  include an attribute expression to select only elements that match the expression,
              but the permission still applies to the entire element (and its subtree),  not  to  the  attribute
              alone.  For  example, using the xpath "//*[@name]" to give write permission would allow changes to
              the entirety of all elements that have  a  "name"  attribute  and  everything  enclosed  by  those
              elements. There is no way currently to give permissions for just one attribute of an element. That
              is to say, you can not define an ACL that allows someone to read just the dc-uuid attribute of the
              cib tag - that would select the cib element and give read access to the entire CIB.

       role delete &lt;role id&gt;
              Delete the role specified and remove it from any users/groups it was assigned to.

       role remove &lt;role id&gt;
              Delete the role specified and remove it from any users/groups it was assigned to.

       role assign &lt;role id&gt; [to] user|group &lt;username/group&gt;
              Assign a role to a user or group already created with 'pcs acl user|group create'.

       role unassign &lt;role id&gt; [from] user|group &lt;username/group&gt;
              Remove a role from the specified user or group.

              Remove the group specified (and roles assigned will be unassigned for the specified group).

       group remove &lt;group&gt;
              Remove the group specified (and roles assigned will be unassigned for the specified group).

       permission add &lt;role id&gt; ((read | write | deny) (xpath &lt;query&gt; | id &lt;id&gt;))...
              Add the listed permissions to the role specified. Permissions are applied to either an xpath query
              or the id of a specific element in the CIB.
              Permissions  are  applied  to the selected XML element's entire XML subtree (all elements enclosed
              within it). Write permission grants the ability to create, modify, or remove the element  and  its
              subtree, and also the ability to create any "scaffolding" elements (enclosing elements that do not
              have  attributes  other  than  an  ID).  Permissions for more specific matches (more deeply nested
              elements) take precedence over more general ones. If multiple permissions are configured  for  the
              same  match  (for example, in different roles applied to the same user), any deny permission takes
              precedence, then write, then lastly read.
              An xpath may include an attribute expression to select only elements that  match  the  expression,
              but  the  permission  still  applies to the entire element (and its subtree), not to the attribute
              alone. For example, using the xpath "//*[@name]" to give write permission would allow  changes  to

              Request &lt;source resource&gt; to run on the same node where pacemaker has determined &lt;target resource&gt;
              should  run.  Positive values of score mean the resources should be run on the same node, negative
              values mean the resources should  not  be  run  on  the  same  node.   Specifying  'INFINITY'  (or
              '-INFINITY')  for  the  score  forces &lt;source resource&gt; to run (or not run) with &lt;target resource&gt;
              (score defaults to "INFINITY"). A role can be: 'Promoted', 'Unpromoted', 'Started', 'Stopped'  (if
              no role is specified, it defaults to 'Started').

              Show runtime status of specified model of quorum device provider.  Using  <b>--full</b>  will  give  more
              detailed  output.   If  &lt;cluster  name&gt; is specified, only information about the specified cluster
              will be displayed.

       setup model &lt;device model&gt; [<b>--enable</b>] [<b>--start</b>]
              Configure specified model of quorum device provider.  Quorum device then can be added to  clusters
              by  running  "pcs  quorum device add" command in a cluster.  <b>--start</b> will also start the provider.
              <b>--enable</b> will configure the provider to start on boot.

       device add [&lt;generic options&gt;] model &lt;device model&gt; [&lt;model options&gt;] [heuristics &lt;heuristics options&gt;]
              Add a quorum device to the cluster. Quorum device should be configured  first  with  "pcs  qdevice
              setup". It is not possible to use more than one quorum device in a cluster simultaneously.
              Currently  the  only supported model is 'net'. It requires model options 'algorithm' and 'host' to
              be specified. Options  are  documented  in  <a href="../man8/corosync-qdevice.8.html">corosync-qdevice</a>(8)  man  page;  generic  options  are
              'sync_timeout'  and  'timeout',  for  model  net  options check the quorum.device.net section, for
              heuristics options  see  the  quorum.device.heuristics  section.  Pcs  automatically  creates  and
              distributes TLS certificates and sets the 'tls' model option to the default value 'on'.
              Example: pcs quorum device add model net algorithm=lms host=qnetd.internal.example.com

       device update [&lt;generic options&gt;] [model &lt;model options&gt;] [heuristics &lt;heuristics options&gt;]
              Add,  remove  or  change quorum device options. Unspecified options will be kept unchanged. If you
              wish to remove an option, set it to empty value, i.e. 'option_name='. Requires the cluster  to  be
              stopped.  Model  and  options  are  all documented in <a href="../man8/corosync-qdevice.8.html">corosync-qdevice</a>(8) man page; for heuristics
              options  check  the  quorum.device.heuristics  subkey  section,  for  model  options   check   the
              quorum.device.&lt;device model&gt; subkey sections.

              WARNING:  If you want to change "host" option of qdevice model net, use "pcs quorum device remove"
              and "pcs quorum device add" commands to set up configuration properly unless old and new  host  is
              the same machine.

       unblock [<b>--yes</b>]
              Cancel waiting for all nodes when establishing quorum.  Useful in situations where  you  know  the
              cluster  is  inquorate,  but  you  are  confident  that  the  cluster should proceed with resource
              management regardless.  This command should ONLY be used when nodes which the cluster  is  waiting
              for have been confirmed to be powered off and to have no access to shared resources.

              <b>WARNING:</b>  <b>If</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>nodes</b>  <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> <b>powered</b> <b>off</b> <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>shared</b> <b>resources,</b>

              Remove booth configuration files.

       ticket add &lt;ticket&gt; [&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt; ...]
              Add new ticket to the local site configuration. Ticket options are specified in booth manpage.

       ticket delete &lt;ticket&gt;
              Remove  the  specified  ticket from the local site configuration. The ticket remains loaded in the
              current CIB and should be cleaned up using the "pcs ticket cleanup" command.

       ticket remove &lt;ticket&gt;
              Remove the specified ticket from the local site configuration. The ticket remains  loaded  in  the
              current CIB and should be cleaned up using the "pcs ticket cleanup" command.

       ticket cleanup [ticket]
              Remove  tickets  from CIB at the local site. If no ticket name is provided, remove all the tickets
              present in the CIB but not in the booth configuration. If  the  ticket  name  is  specified,  then
              remove the specified ticket from CIB.

       ticket standby &lt;ticket&gt;
              Tell  the  cluster  on the local site that this ticket is standby. The dependent resources will be
              stopped or demoted gracefully without triggering loss-policies.

       ticket unstandby &lt;ticket&gt;
              Tell the cluster on the local site that this ticket is no longer standby.

       config [&lt;node&gt;]
              Show booth configuration from the specified node or from the current node if node not specified.

       create ip &lt;address&gt;
              Make the cluster run booth service on the specified ip address as a cluster  resource.   Typically
              this is used to run booth site.

       remove Remove booth resources created by the "pcs booth create" command.

       restart
              Restart booth resources created by the "pcs booth create" command.

       ticket grant &lt;ticket&gt; [&lt;site address&gt;]
              Grant the ticket to the site specified by the address, hence to the booth formation this site is a
              member  of.  When  this  specification  is omitted, site address that has been specified with 'pcs
              booth create' command is used. Specifying site address is therefore mandatory  when  running  this
              command at a host in an arbitrator role.
              Note  that the ticket must not be already granted in given booth formation; for an ad-hoc (and, in
              the worst case, abrupt, for a lack of a direct atomicity) change of this preference baring  direct
              interventions  at  the sites, the ticket needs to be revoked first, only then it can be granted at
              another site again.

       ticket revoke &lt;ticket&gt; [&lt;site address&gt;]
              Revoke the ticket in the booth formation as identified with one of its member sites  specified  by
              the address. When this specification is omitted, site address that has been specified with a prior
              'pcs  booth  create'  command is used. Specifying site address is therefore mandatory when running
              this command at a host in an arbitrator role.

       status Print current status of booth on the local node.

       pull &lt;node&gt;
              Pull booth configuration from the specified node.  Pull booth  configuration  from  the  specified
              node.  After  pulling  the  configuration, the booth should be restarted. In case any tickets were
              removed, the "pcs ticket cleanup" command should be used to  remove  any  leftover  tickets  still
              loaded in the CIB at the current site.

       sync [<b>--skip-offline</b>]
              Send booth configuration from the local node to all nodes in the cluster.

              performing the query. Print 'False' and exit with 2 otherwise.
              If <b>--quiet</b> is specified, do not print any output and just exit with the appropriate return code.

       query resource &lt;resource-id&gt; is-type (primitive | group | clone [unique] [promotable] | bundle [unique])
       [<b>--quiet</b>]
              Query  if  the  resource  is  of given type. Allows to query whether clones are globally unique or
              promotable. Allows to query whether bundles are globally unique.

              Print 'True' and exit with 0 if the query evaluates to true. Exit with 1 if an error occurs  while

       query resource &lt;resource-id&gt; get-type
              Get  type  of a resource in pacemaker cluster. The output is one of 'primitive', 'group', 'clone',
              'clone unique', 'clone promotable', 'clone unique promotable', 'bundle' or 'bundle unique'.

       query resource &lt;resource-id&gt; is-state &lt;state&gt; [on-node &lt;node-name&gt;] [members all|any|none] [instances
       all|any|none] [<b>--quiet</b>]
              Query if the resource is  in  the  given  state.  &lt;state&gt;  can  be  one  of  'active',  'blocked',
              'demoting',   'disabled',  'enabled',  'failed',  'failure_ignored',  'locked_to',  'maintenance',
              'managed', 'migrating', 'monitoring', 'orphaned', 'pending', 'promoted',  'promoting',  'started',
              'starting', 'stopped', 'stopping', 'unmanaged' or 'unpromoted'.

              States 'starting', 'stopping', 'promoting', 'demoting', 'migrating' and 'monitoring' describe that
              resource  operation  (start,  stop,  promote, demote, migrate_from/to, or monitor) is currently in
              progress on the resource. 'pending' will evaluate to true if any of these operations is  currently
              in progress on the resource.

              State 'locked_to' allows to specify node name of the node that the resource is locked to.

              With groups, the state is read and evaluated on the group first. If the state cannot be determined
              from  only  the  group, evaluate the state of the member resources and return true if the query is
              true for ALL of the members. 'members' can be used to specify how to evaluate the  states  of  the
              members.  If  'members'  is specified, then always evaluate the query only on the member resources
              without looking at the group itself. This  means  that  for  example  queries  for  'started'  and
              'stopped'  on  a  group with one started and one stopped member will both evaluate as false at the
              same time if 'members' is not specified or it is set to 'all'.

              With clones and bundles, the state is read and evaluated on the clone  or  bundle  first.  If  the
              state  cannot be determined from only the clone or bundle, evaluate the state on the instances and
              return true if the query is true for ANY of the instances. 'instances' can be used to specify  how
              to  evaluate  the  state  of  the instances. If 'instances' is specified, then always evaluate the
              query only on the instances without looking at the clone or bundle themselves. This means that for
              example queries for 'started' and 'stopped' on a clone with one started and one  stopped  instance
              will both evaluate as true at the same time if 'instances' is not specified or it is set to 'any'.

              'on-node'  can  be  used to test whether the resource is in given state on the node with the given
              name. If 'on-node' is used, then always check only the member resources for groups  and  instances
              for clones or bundles.

              Queries  on  the state of cloned or bundled resources are evaluated similarly to queries on clones
              or bundles. Evaluate the state of every instance and return true if the query is true for  ANY  of
              the  instances.  'instances'  can  be  used  to  specify  how the query should be evaluated. It is
              possible to query single specific instance of unique  clones  or  bundles  by  using  resource  id
              together with the suffix that distinguishes instances for unique clones and bundles.
              Example: Query if any instance of resource is started
                  pcs status query resource resource_id is-state started
              Example: Query if one specific instance is started
                  pcs status query resource resource_id:0 is-state started

              Print  'True' and exit with 0 if the query evaluates to true. Exit with 1 if an error occurs while
              performing the query. Print 'False' and exit with 2 otherwise.
              If <b>--quiet</b> is specified, do not print any output and just exit with the appropriate return code.

       query resource &lt;resource-id&gt; is-in-group [&lt;group-id&gt;] [<b>--quiet</b>]
              Query if the resource is in any group or in a group with the specified id.

              Print 'True' and exit with 0 if the query evaluates to true. Exit with 1 if an error occurs  while
              performing the query. Print 'False' and exit with 2 otherwise.
              Print the id of the group on new line if the resource is in any group.
              If <b>--quiet</b> is specified, do not print any output and just exit with the appropriate return code.

       query resource &lt;resource-id&gt; is-in-clone [&lt;clone-id&gt;] [<b>--quiet</b>]
              Query  if  the resource is in any clone or in a clone with the specified id. Resource that is in a
              cloned group is considered to be in the clone itself.

              Print 'True' and exit with 0 if the query evaluates to true. Exit with 1 if an error occurs  while
              performing the query. Print 'False' and exit with 2 otherwise.
              Print the id of the clone on new line if the resource is in any clone.
              If <b>--quiet</b> is specified, do not print any output and just exit with the appropriate return code.

       query resource &lt;resource-id&gt; is-in-bundle [&lt;bundle-id&gt;] [<b>--quiet</b>]
              Query if the resource is in any bundle or in a bundle with the specified id.

              Print  'True' and exit with 0 if the query evaluates to true. Exit with 1 if an error occurs while
              performing the query. Print 'False' and exit with 2 otherwise.
              Print the id of the bundle on new line if the resource is in any bundle.
              If <b>--quiet</b> is specified, do not print any output and just exit with the appropriate return code.

       query resource &lt;resource-id&gt; get-nodes
              Get all nodes on which the resource is running. With groups, return nodes  on  which  any  of  the
              members  is running. For clones or bundles, return nodes on which any of the instances or replicas
              are running.

              Print each node name on new line.

       query resource &lt;resource-id&gt; get-members
              Get ids of member resources of the resource. Only useful for group, clone and bundle resources.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>--FORCE</b> <b>IN</b> <b>PCS</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Various  pcs  commands  accept  the <b>--force</b> option. Its purpose is to override some of checks that pcs is
       doing or some of errors that may occur when a pcs command is run. When such error occurs, pcs will  print
       the  error  with  a note it may be overridden. The exact behavior of the option is different for each pcs
       command. Using the <b>--force</b> option can lead into situations that would normally be prevented by  logic  of
       pcs commands and therefore <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>is</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>discouraged</b> <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       EDITOR
               Path to a plain-text editor. This is used when pcs is requested to present a text for the user to
              edit.

       no_proxy, https_proxy, all_proxy, NO_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, ALL_PROXY
               These  environment variables (listed according to their priorities) control how pcs handles proxy
              servers when connecting to cluster nodes. See <a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a>(1) man page for details.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>IN</b> <b>PCS-0.12</b></h4><pre>
       This section summarizes the most important changes in commands done in pcs-0.12.x compared to pcs-0.11.x.
       For detailed description of current commands see above.

   <b>Pacemaker</b> <b>3</b> <b>changes</b>
       Following pacemaker 3, pcs has dropped support for:
              nagios and upstart resource classes
              rkt containers in bundle resources
              multiple rules in a single location constraint

   <b>Legacy</b> <b>role</b> <b>names</b>
       Legacy role names and derived options and keywords are no longer accepted, use 'Promoted', 'Unpromoted',
       <b>--promoted</b>, 'promotable', 'promoted-max'.

   <b>Mixing</b> <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>stonith</b> <b>resources</b>
        Using stonith resources in 'pcs resource' commands and resources in 'pcs stonith' commands is no  longer
       allowed.

   <b>Resources</b> <b>validation</b>
       When creating or updating a resource or stonith, its options are now validated by the resource or stonith
       agent.  Unless  <b>--agent-validation</b>  is  specified,  this  does not prevent misconfiguring the resource or
       stonith by exiting with an error. In pcs-0.11, the validation was done only when  <b>--agent-validation</b>  was
       specified.

   <b>Pacemaker</b> <b>rules</b>
       Several  date-spec  and  duration  options  have  been  removed  in pacemaker 3. Therefore, pcs no longer
       supports them either. Previously  supported  date-spec  and  duration  options  were:  hours,  monthdays,
       weekdays,  yearsdays, months, weeks, years, weekyears, moon. New date-spec options are: seconds, minutes,
       hours, monthdays, weekdays, yeardays, months, weeks, years, weekyears. New duration options are: seconds,
       minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years.
       Using spaces in dates in location constraint rules is no longer allowed.
       Rules are supposed to be specified as a single string argument. Specifying rules  as  multiple  arguments
       has been deprecated and might be removed in a future release.

   <b>--yes</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>--force</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>confirmation</b>
       Some  pcs  commands  require interactive confirmation to proceed. Previously, this could be overridden by
       specifying <b>--force</b>. Since pcs-0.12, using <b>--force</b> for this purpose is deprecated in favor of  <b>--yes</b>.  The
       <b>--force</b>  flag  is  kept  to  override  validation errors, which was its originally intended use. Affected
       commands are: 'pcs cluster destroy', 'pcs quorum unblock', 'pcs stonith confirm', 'pcs stonith sbd device
       setup' and 'pcs stonith sbd watchdog test'.

   <b>acl</b>
       role assign | unassign
              The possibility of not specifying 'user' or 'group' keyword is now deprecated and might be removed
              in a future release.

       show   This deprecated command has been removed. Use 'pcs acl config' instead

   <b>alert</b>
       show   This deprecated command has been removed. Use 'pcs alert config' instead.

   <b>cluster</b>
       certkey
              This deprecated command has been removed. Use 'pcs pcsd certkey' instead.

       node add-remote | add-guest
              <b>--wait</b> option is deprecated. Instead, use the 'pcs status wait' command to wait for the cluster to
              settle into stable state. Use the 'pcs status query resource' commands to verify that the resource
              is in the expected state after the wait.

       node remove-remote | delete-remote
              These commands no longer remove location constraints referencing the  node  name  of  the  removed
              remote node.

       pcsd-status
              This deprecated command has been removed. Use 'pcs status pcsd' or 'pcs pcsd status' instead.

   <b>constraint</b>
       colocation add
              Specifying  score  as  a  standalone  value  is deprecated in favor of score=value. This makes the
              command consistent with other commands for creating constraints.

       list   This deprecated command, as well as its variants 'pcs constraint [location | colocation | order  |
              ticket]  list',  has  been  removed.  Use 'pcs constraint [location | colocation | order | ticket]
              config' instead.

       location add
              Specifying score as a standalone value is deprecated in  favor  of  score=value.  This  makes  the
              command consistent with other commands for creating constraints.

       rule add | delete | remove
              These  deprecated commands have been removed, as pacemaker 3 no longer allows location constraints
              to contain more than one rule.

       show   This deprecated command, as well as its variants 'pcs constraint [location | colocation | order  |
              ticket]  show',  has  been  removed.  Use 'pcs constraint [location | colocation | order | ticket]
              config' instead.

   <b>property</b>
       list   This deprecated command has been removed. Use 'pcs property config' instead.

       show   This deprecated command has been removed. Use 'pcs property config' instead.

   <b>resource</b>
       <b>--wait</b> option
              This option is deprecated in all resource commands except 'pcs resource restart' and 'pcs resource
              move'. Instead, use the 'pcs status wait' command to wait for the cluster to  settle  into  stable
              state. Use the 'pcs status query resource' commands to verify that the resource is in the expected
              state after the wait.

       defaults &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;...
              This  deprecated command has been removed. Use 'pcs resource defaults update &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;...' if
              you only manage one set of defaults, or 'pcs resource defaults set' if you manage several sets  of
              defaults.

       move   Since  pcs-0.11,  this  command  automatically  deletes  location  constraints  used  for moving a
              resource. Therefore, its deprecated flag <b>--autodelete</b> has been removed.

       op defaults &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;...
              This deprecated command has been removed. Use 'pcs resource op defaults update  &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;...'
              if  you  only  manage one set of defaults, or 'pcs resource op defaults set' if you manage several
              sets of defaults.

       remove | delete
              Removing resources representing remote and guest nodes is no longer  possible.  Use  'pcs  cluster
              node  remove-remote'  to  remove  remote nodes and 'pcs cluster node remove-guest' to remove guest
              nodes.

   <b>stonith</b>
       create <b>--group</b>
              Creating stonith resources in groups is no longer allowed.

       defaults &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;...
              This deprecated command has been removed. Use 'pcs stonith defaults update  &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;...'  if
              you  only  manage one set of defaults, or 'pcs stonith defaults set' if you manage several sets of
              defaults.

       disable
              Deprecated options <b>--brief</b>, <b>--no-strict</b>, <b>--safe</b> and <b>--simulate</b> have been removed.

       level add | clear | delete | remove
              Delimiting stonith devices with a comma is no longer allowed.
              Ambiguous syntax of 'pcs stonith level clear | delete | remove' is no longer supported.

       op defaults &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;...
              This deprecated command has been removed. Use 'pcs stonith op defaults  update  &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;...'
              if  you  only  manage  one set of defaults, or 'pcs stonith op defaults set' if you manage several
              sets of defaults.

   <b>tag</b>
       list   This deprecated command has been removed. Use 'pcs tag config' instead.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>IN</b> <b>PCS-0.11</b></h4><pre>
       This section summarizes the most important changes in commands done in pcs-0.11.x compared to pcs-0.10.x.
       For detailed description of current commands see above.

   <b>Legacy</b> <b>role</b> <b>names</b>
       Roles 'Master' and 'Slave' are deprecated and should not be used anymore. Instead, use 'Promoted' and
       'Unpromoted', respectively. Similarly, <b>--master</b> has been deprecated and replaced with <b>--promoted</b>.

   <b>cluster</b>
       uidgid rm
              This command has been replaced with 'pcs cluster uidgid delete' and 'pcs cluster uidgid remove'.

   <b>resource</b>
       move   The 'pcs resource move' now automatically removes location constraint used for moving a  resource.
              It  is equivalent of 'pcs resource move <b>--autodelete</b>' from pcs-0.10.9. Legacy functionality of the
              'resource move' command is still available as 'resource move-with-constraint &lt;resource id&gt;'.

       show <b>--full</b>
              This command has been replaced with 'pcs resource config'.

   <b>cluster</b>
       auth   The  'pcs  cluster auth' command only authenticates nodes in a local cluster and does not accept a
              node list. The new command for authentication is 'pcs host auth'. It allows one  to  specify  host
              names, addresses and pcsd ports.

       node add
              Custom  node  names  and  Corosync 3.x with knet are fully supported now, therefore the syntax has

       show   Previously, this command displayed either status or configuration of resources  depending  on  the
              parameters  specified.  This  was  confusing,  therefore  the  command was replaced by several new
              commands. To display resources status, run 'pcs resource' or 'pcs  resource  status'.  To  display

              commands.  To  display  stonith  resources  status,  run 'pcs stonith' or 'pcs stonith status'. To
              display stonith resources configuration, run 'pcs stonith config' or 'pcs stonith config  &lt;stonith
              name&gt;'.

   <b>tag</b>
       list   The  'pcs  tag  list' command has been deprecated and will be removed. Please use 'pcs tag config'
