</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Pchar</u> measures the characteristics of the network path between two Internet hosts, on either IPv4 or IPv6
       networks.   It  is  an  independently-written  reimplementation  of  the  <u>pathchar</u> utility, using similar
       algorithms.  Both programs measure network throughput and round-trip time by  sending  varying-sized  UDP
       packets  into  the network and waiting for ICMP messages in response.  Like <u>traceroute</u>, they modulate the
       IPv4 time-to-live (TTL) field or the IPv6 hop limit field to  get  measurements  at  different  distances
       along a path.

       In its default mode, a run of <u>pchar</u> over a short path might produce an output that looks like this:
       pchar to dancer.ca.sandia.gov (146.246.246.1) using UDP/IPv4
       Packet size increments by 32 to 1500

           Hop char:          rtt = 0.233133 ms, bw = 4686.320952 Kbps
           Partial queueing:  avg = 0.000100 ms (46 bytes)
        3: 146.246.246.1 (dancer.ca.sandia.gov)
           Path length:       3 hops
           Path char:         rtt = 1.044412 ms, r2 = 0.999658
           Path bottleneck:   4686.320952 Kbps
           Path pipe:         611 bytes
           Path queueing:     average = 0.000100 ms (46 bytes)

       The  path  here  passes  through  three  hops.   Each  hop consists of four lines of output: <b>Partial</b> <b>loss</b>
       documents the number and percentage of probe packets that were lost during the probes for that hop.   The
       <b>partial</b> <b>char</b> line shows the estimated round-trip time from the probing host through the current hop.  The
       <b>hop</b>  <b>char</b>  line  shows  estimates of the round-trip time and bandwidth for the current hop.  Finally, the
       <b>partial</b> <b>queueing</b> shows an estimate of the average queueing along  the  path,  up  to  and  including  the
       current hop.

       Between  each  hop,  <u>pchar</u> prints the IP address and (if known) name of the host/router at the end of the
       link.

       After the last hop (usually the target host), <u>pchar</u> prints statistics on the entire path,  including  the
       <b>path</b> <b>length</b> and <b>path</b> <b>pipe</b> (the latter is an estimate of the delay-bandwidth product of the path).

       <u>Pchar</u>  has  another mode of operation, called <u>trout</u> (short for “tiny traceroute”).  In this mode, packets
       of random sizes (one packet per hop diameter) are sent along the path to a destination.   No  attempt  at
       estimating  link  properties  is made; however, this mode is extremely fast.  It is intended for use as a
       part of a larger measurement infrastructure.  The output from this mode might look like:
       trout to bmah-freebsd-1.cisco.com (171.70.84.44) using ICMP/IPv4 (raw sockets)
       Packet size increments from 28 to 1500 by 32
        0: 171.70.84.42 (bmah-freebsd-0.cisco.com)
        1: 171.70.84.44 (bmah-freebsd-1.cisco.com) 352 -&gt; 352 bytes: 0.318 ms

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b> <u>analysis</u>
              Set analysis type.  Current choices are <b>lsq</b> (the default), which uses a minimum filter followed by
              a least sum-of-squares fit to estimate link bandwidths,  <b>kendall</b>,  which  uses  the  same  minimum
              filter  followed  by  a  linear  fit  based on Kendall's test statistic, <b>lms</b>, which does a minimum
              filter followed by a least median of squares fit, and <b>lmsint</b>, which is an  implementation  of  the
              <b>lms</b> computations using only integer arithmetic.

       <b>-b</b> <u>burst</u>
              Set the size of packet bursts.  A burst parameter &gt; 1 will result in some number of ICMP_ECHOREPLY
              packets  sent  before the probe packet to induce queueing.  These packets are useful for measuring
              store-and-forward switched subnets,  but  make  measurements  of  fast  links  behind  bottlenecks
              inaccurate.

       <b>-c</b>     Ignore  routing  changes  detected  during  running.   Normally,  <u>pchar</u>  will  exit if it receives
              responses from more than one host for a given hop, assuming that this condition  is  caused  by  a
              routing  transient.   However,  certain  load-balancing schemes can also cause this condition.  In
              such situations, using the <b>-c</b> option may be useful.

       <b>-C</b>     Use <u><a href="../man3/pcap.3.html">pcap</a></u>(3) packet capture library (this must have been enabled at  configure  time).   Note  that
              this option must be specified to enable TCP-based probes.

       <b>-d</b> <u>debug</u>
              Sets debugging output level.  Generally not useful except to the developer.

       <b>-g</b> <u>gap</u> Set the mean inter-probe gap in seconds.  The default is 0.25, which results in approximately four
              probes  per second being run.  Care should be taken not to decrease this gap by too much, in order
              to avoid flooding the network.  The default value here is deliberately  conservative;  users  with
              the  need  or desire to probe more quickly are presumed to have at least perused the documentation
              for the relevant command-line options.

       <b>-G</b> <u>gaptype</u>
              Set distribution used to select  interprobe  gap  times.   Current  alternatives  are  <b>fixed</b>  (the
              default) and <b>exp</b>, which picks gap times from an exponential distribution.  The latter option is an
              attempt  to simulate a Poisson process of probe packets (a lot of aliteration), however due to the
              fact that each probe experiment takes a non-zero amount of time, this is only an approximation.

       <b>-H</b> <u>hops</u>
              Set the maximum number of hops that <u>pchar</u> will probe into the network.  The default maximum is  30
              hops, the same as with <u>pathchar</u> and <u>traceroute.</u>

       <b>-h</b>     Print usage information.

       <b>-i</b> <u>interface</u>
              Set the interface to listen on for the <b>-C</b> option.

       <b>-I</b> <u>increment</u>
              Set  the  probe  packet  size  increment.   <u>Pchar</u> will send IP packets with sizes that are integer
              multiples of <u>increment</u>, up to the maximum specified by the <b>-m</b> option.  The default  is  a  32-byte
              increment.   Small increments should produce more accurate results, but will result in more probes
              (thus taking longer to run).

       <b>-l</b> <u>origin</u>
              Set the local source of probe packets.  This option is mostly useful on multi-homed hosts.  If not
              specified, it defaults to the value of <u><a href="../man3/hostname.3.html">hostname</a></u>(3).  Note that this option <u>must</u>  be  used  if  the
              local hostname cannot be resolved to an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

       <b>-m</b> <u>mtu</u> Set  the  maximum probe packet size.  This value should be no larger than the path MTU between the
              two hosts.  The default is 1500 bytes, the Ethernet MTU.

       <b>-M</b> <u>mode</u>
              Set operational mode.  The  normal  operational  mode  is  <u>pchar</u>,  which  uses  active  probes  to
              characterize  the  bandwidth, latency, loss, and queueing of the links comprising a path.  Another
              mode is <u>trout</u>, a “tiny traceroute” that is intended to be used as a portion of  a  larger  network
              management infrastructure.

       <b>-n</b>     Don't attempt to resolve host addresses to names.

       <b>-p</b> <u>protocol</u>
              Select  protocol  to  use.   Current options are: <b>ipv4udp</b> (UDP over IPv4), <b>ipv4raw</b> (UDP over IPv4,
              using raw IP packets), <b>ipv4icmp</b> (ICMP over IPv4, using raw IP packets), <b>ipv4tcp</b>  (TCP  over  IPv4,
              using  raw  IP  packets), <b>ipv6icmp</b> (ICMPv6 over IPv6, using raw IP packets), and <b>ipv6udp</b> (UDP over
              IPv6).  The default protocol is either <b>ipv4udp</b> or <b>ipv6udp</b>, as  appropriate  to  the  network-layer
              address  associated  with  the  <u>hostname</u>  provided.   Compared with <b>ipv4udp</b>, the implementation of
              <b>ipv4raw</b> offers finer control over the contents of packet fields, but is otherwise identical.  Note
              that the <b>ipv6icmp</b> and <b>ipv6udp</b> options are only available if IPv6 support was compiled into  <u>pchar</u>,
              which  can  be  selected  at  configure  time.   Finally, the <b>ipv4tcp</b> option requires that <u><a href="../man3/pcap.3.html">pcap</a></u>(3)
              support be specified at configure time and enabled with the <b>-C</b> option.

       <b>-P</b> <u>port</u>
              Select starting UDP port number (the default is  32768).   <u>Pchar</u>  uses  consecutive  port  numbers
              starting  from  this  value,  counting  up.  Care should be taken not to use port numbers that are
              actually in use by network services.

       <b>-q</b>     Quiet mode, suppressing all output.  Useful if writing statistics to  standard  out  (see  the  <b>-w</b>
              option).

       <b>-r</b> <u>file</u>
              Read  measurements  in from a file named <u>file</u>, as written by the <b>-w</b> option.  This option is useful
              for experimenting with different analysis algorithms over a fixed data set.

       <b>-R</b> <u>reps</u>
              Set the number of repetitions of each probe packet size to be sent.  The default is 32 packets  of
              each size.  Smaller values speed up testing, at the expense of accuracy.

       <b>-s</b> <u>hop</u> Set  the  starting hop at which to begin probing.  The default is 1, so network probing will begin
              at the host adjacent to the host where <u>pchar</u> is being run.  Larger values allow probing  to  begin
              farther  out  from  the testing host; this can be helpful when attempting to probe outside a local
              internetwork whose characterisics are well-known.

       <b>-S</b>     Do SNMP queries at each hop to determine each  router's  idea  of  what  it  thinks  its  next-hop
              interface  characteristics  are.   Use  of this features requires the UCD SNMP library, as well as
              enabling at configure-time using <b>--with-snmp</b>.

       <b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u>
              Set the amount of time (in seconds) that  <u>pchar</u>  will  wait  for  an  ICMP  error  message  before
              declaring a packet loss.  The default is 3 seconds.

       <b>-T</b> <u>tos</u> Set the IP Type Of Service bits for outgoing UDP packets.  This option isn't terribly useful for a
              lot  of  people,  but it can be used, for example, to force a particular DiffServ codepoint within
              networks that support this functionality.  For values of <b>-p</b>  that  use  IPv6  as  a  network-layer
              protocol, this option sets the traffic class field in the IPv6 header according to RFC 2460.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose  mode.   While  each probe is in progress, print a synopsis of the hop number, repetition,
              and probe packet size on standard out.  Verbose mode mimics the output of <u>pathchar</u>.

       <b>-V</b>     Print version and copyright information and exit.

       <b>-w</b> <u>file</u>
              Write statistics to a datafile named <u>file</u>.  This file can be read back in  by  specifying  the  <b>-r</b>
              option  in  a  subsequent  run  of  <u>pchar</u>  for  off-line analysis, or parsed by other programs for
              plotting, etc.

              If <u>file</u> is given as - , then the statistics are written to standard out.  In this case, the  quiet
              flag <b>-q</b> may be useful, to avoid cluttering the standard output stream.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Because  <u>pchar</u>  relies  on  measurements  to  drive  its  estimates  of  network  characteristics, it may
       occasionally produce some seemingly odd results.  Care should be taken when interpreting  the  output  of
       <u>pchar</u>.   For example, the coeffecients of determination for the least squares fit can be useful in seeing
       how “good” of a fit the bandwidth and round-trip time parameters describe the  performance  seen  by  the
       probe  packets.   The coefficient of determination takes values from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates
       that the estimated parameters perfectly fit the data.

       <u>Pchar</u> was originally named <u>pc</u>, which was either an abbreviation for “path characteristics”  or  “pathchar
       clone”.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Pathchar</u>  automatically  determines  an  appropriate  maximum  packet  size  to  use, based on a Path MTU
       discovery algorithm.  <u>Pchar</u> relies on the user specifying the maximum packet size manually.

       Some versions of Solaris rate-limit the generation of ICMP error messages.  Any run of <u>pchar</u> through,  or
       to,  a  Solaris  machine  may  show  abnormally  high packet loss rates.  This feature of Solaris affects
       <u>traceroute</u> and <u>pathchar</u> as well, but not <u>ping</u>.  Some versions of  Linux  appear  to  have  similar  rate-
       limiting.  In situations such as this, the use of ICMP-based probes (selected by the <b>-p</b> option) may yield
       more satisfactory (or at least faster) results.

       Timestamps printed after each run are printed relative to the local time zone.  Timestamps saved in trace
       files are expressed as seconds past the epoch.

       There are way too many command-line options.
