</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       guessnet-scan - guess network configuration data by looking at network traffic

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>guessnet-scan</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>ethernet_interface</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Guessnet-scan</b>  tries to deduce network configuration data by watching network traffic at a given Ethernet
       interface.

       After scanning network traffic for some time, <b>guessnet-scan</b> prints a configuration  string  suitable  for
       inclusion in /etc/network/interfaces.

       Note that <b>guessnet-scan</b> uses heuristics and wild guesses and that the resulting data is not guaranteed to
       be  accurate.   The  program  is intended to be used as a first try at getting network configuration data
       without bothering anyone.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options follow the usual GNU conventions,

       <b>--debug</b>
              Print debugging messages.

       <b>--help</b> Show a brief summary of commandline options.

       <b>--init-time</b>=<u>int</u>
              Time in seconds to wait for the interface to initialize when it is not found already up at program
              startup.  Default: 3 seconds.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--timeout=</b><u>int</u>
              Time in seconds to watch for network traffic.  Default: 5 seconds.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Operate verbosely.

       <b>--version</b>
              Show the version number of the program.

</pre><h4><b>SCANNING</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       To correctly identify all data of the local network, <b>guessnet-scan</b> needs to see traffic related to a host
       in the local network and to the local gateway, if any.

       To be able to identify the network gateway, <b>guessnet-scan</b> also needs to see some traffic directed to  the
       external  network: you can help the detection by generating some outbound IP traffic during the scan, for
       example by browsing a web page (without proxy) or using telnet to open a connection to some remote host.

       Note that if you are connected to a switch, <b>guessnet-scan</b> won't probably  be  able  to  work,  since  the
       switch will isolate it from the network traffic that the other machines are generating.
