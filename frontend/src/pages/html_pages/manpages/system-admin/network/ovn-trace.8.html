</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ovn-trace - Open Virtual Network logical network tracing utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ovn-trace</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>[datapath]</u> <u>microflow</u>

       <b>ovn-trace</b> [<u>options</u>] <b>--detach</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  utility  simulates  packet  forwarding within an OVN logical network. It can be used to run through
       ``what-if’’ scenarios: if a packet originates at a logical port, what will happen to it and where will it
       ultimately end up? Users already familiar with  the  Open  vSwitch  <b>ofproto/trace</b>  command  described  in
       <b><a href="../man8/ovs-vswitch.8.html">ovs-vswitch</a></b>(8) will find <b>ovn-trace</b> to be a similar tool for logical networks.

       <b>ovn-trace</b>  works  by  reading  the  <b>Logical_Flow</b>  and  other tables from the OVN southbound database (see
       <b><a href="../man5/ovn-sb.5.html">ovn-sb</a></b>(5)). It simulates a packet’s path through logical networks by repeatedly  looking  it  up  in  the
       logical flow table, following the entire tree of possibilities.

       <b>ovn-trace</b> simulates only the OVN logical network. It does not simulate the physical elements on which the
       logical network is layered. This means that, for example, it is unimportant how VMs are distributed among
       hypervisors, or whether their hypervisors are functioning and reachable, so <b>ovn-trace</b> will yield the same
       results  regardless.  There is one important exception: <b>ovn-northd</b>, the daemon that generates the logical
       flows that <b>ovn-trace</b> simulates, treats logical ports differently based on whether they are  up  or  down.
       Thus, if you see surprising results, ensure that the ports involved in a simulation are up.

       The  simplest  way  to use <b>ovn-trace</b> is to provide the <u>microflow</u> (and optional <u>datapath</u>) arguments on the
       command line. In this case, it simulates the behavior of a single packet  and  exits.  For  an  alternate
       usage model, see <b>Daemon</b> <b>Mode</b> below.

       The  optional  <u>datapath</u>  argument specifies the name of a logical datapath. Acceptable names are the <b>name</b>
       from the northbound <b>Logical_Switch</b> or <b>Logical_Router</b> table, the UUID  of  a  record  from  one  of  those
       tables,  or  the  UUID  of a record from the southbound <b>Datapath_Binding</b> table. (The <b>datapath</b> is optional
       because <b>ovn-trace</b> can figure it out from the <u>inport</u> that the <u>microflow</u> matches.)

       The <u>microflow</u> argument describes the packet whose forwarding is to be simulated, in the syntax of an  OVN
       logical   expression,  as  described  in  <b><a href="../man5/ovn-sb.5.html">ovn-sb</a></b>(5),  to  express  constraints.  The  parser  understands
       prerequisites; for example, if the expression refers to <b>ip4.src</b>, there is no need to explicitly state <b>ip4</b>
       or <b>eth.type</b> <b>==</b> <b>0x800</b>.

       For reasonable L2 behavior, the microflow should include at least <b>inport</b> and  <b>eth.dst</b>,  plus  <b>eth.src</b>  if
       port security is enabled. For example:

           <b>inport</b> <b>==</b> <b>"lp11"</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>eth.src</b> <b>==</b> <b>00:01:02:03:04:05</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>eth.dst</b> <b>==</b> <b>ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</b>

       For  reasonable  L3  behavior, <u>microflow</u> should also include <b>ip4.src</b> and <b>ip4.dst</b> (or <b>ip6.src</b> and <b>ip6.dst</b>)
       and <b>ip.ttl</b>. For example:

           <b>inport</b> <b>==</b> <b>"lp111"</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>eth.src</b> <b>==</b> <b>f0:00:00:00:01:11</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>eth.dst</b> <b>==</b> <b>00:00:00:00:ff:11</b>
           <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>ip4.src</b> <b>==</b> <b>192.168.11.1</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>ip4.dst</b> <b>==</b> <b>192.168.22.2</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>ip.ttl</b> <b>==</b> <b>64</b>

       Here’s an ARP microflow example:

           <b>inport</b> <b>==</b> <b>"lp123"</b>
           <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>eth.dst</b> <b>==</b> <b>ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>eth.src</b> <b>==</b> <b>f0:00:00:00:01:11</b>
           <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>arp.op</b> <b>==</b> <b>1</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>arp.sha</b> <b>==</b> <b>f0:00:00:00:01:11</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>arp.spa</b> <b>==</b> <b>192.168.1.11</b>
           <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>arp.tha</b> <b>==</b> <b>ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>arp.tpa</b> <b>==</b> <b>192.168.2.22</b>

       <b>ovn-trace</b> will reject  erroneous  microflow  expressions,  which  beyond  syntax  errors  fall  into  two
       categories.  First,  they  can  be ambiguous. For example, <b>tcp.src</b> <b>==</b> <b>80</b> is ambiguous because it does not
       state IPv4 or IPv6 as the Ethernet type. <b>ip4</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>tcp.src</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>1024</b> is also  ambiguous  because  it  does  not
       constrain bits of <b>tcp.src</b> to particular values. Second, they can be contradictory, e.g. <b>ip4</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>ip6</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ovn-trace</b>  supports  the  three  different  forms  of output, each described in a separate section below.
       Regardless of the selected output format, <b>ovn-trace</b>  starts  the  output  with  a  line  that  shows  the
       microflow being traced in OpenFlow syntax.

   <b>Detailed</b> <b>Output</b>
       The  detailed form of output is also the default form. This form groups output into sections headed up by
       the ingress or egress pipeline being traversed. Each pipeline lists  each  table  that  was  visited  (by
       number  and  name), the <b>ovn-northd</b> source file and line number of the code that added the flow, the match
       expression and priority of the logical flow that was matched, and the actions that were executed.

       The execution of OVN logical actions naturally forms a ``control stack’’ that resembles that of a program
       in conventional programming languages such as C or Java. Because the <b>next</b> action that calls into  another
       logical  flow table for a lookup is a recursive construct, OVN ``programs’’ in practice tend to form deep
       control stacks that, displayed in the obvious way using additional indentation for  each  level,  quickly
       use  up  the  horizontal  space  on  all  but the widest displays. To make detailed output more readable,
       without loss of generality, <b>ovn-trace</b> omits indentation for ``tail recursion,’’ that is, when <b>next</b> is the
       last action in a logical flow, it does not indent details of the next table lookup  more  deeply.  Output
       still uses indentation when it is needed for clarity.

       OVN  ``programs’’  traces  also  tend  to encounter long strings of logical flows with match expression <b>1</b>
       (which matches every packet) and the single action <b>next;</b>. These  are  uninteresting  and  merely  clutter
       output, so <b>ovn-trace</b> omits them entirely even from detailed output.

       The  following excerpt from detailed <b>ovn-trace</b> output shows a section for a packet traversing the ingress
       pipeline of logical datapath <b>ls1</b> with ingress logical port <b>lp111</b>. The packet matches a  logical  flow  in
       table  0  (aka  <b>ls_in_port_sec_l2</b>)  with  priority  50 and executes <b><a href="../man1/next.1.html">next</a>(1);</b> to pass to table 1. Tables 1
       through 11 are trivial and omitted. In table 19 (aka <b>ls_in_l2_lkup</b>),  the  packet  matches  a  flow  with
       priority  50  based  on  its Ethernet destination address and the flow’s actions output the packet to the
       <b>lrp11-attachement</b> logical port.

           ingress(dp="ls1", inport="lp111")
           ---------------------------------
           0. ls_in_port_sec_l2: inport == "lp111", priority 50
           <a href="../man1/next.1.html">next</a>(1);
           19. ls_in_l2_lkup: eth.dst == 00:00:00:00:ff:11, priority 50
           outport = "lrp11-attachment";
           output;

   <b>Summary</b> <b>Output</b>
       Summary output includes the logical pipelines visited by a packet and the logical actions executed on it.
       Compared to the detailed output, however, it removes details of tables and logical flows traversed  by  a
       packet.  It  uses  a  format  closer  to  that  of  a  programming language and does not attempt to avoid
       indentation. The summary output equivalent to the above detailed output fragment is:

           ingress(dp="ls1", inport="lp111") {
           outport = "lrp11-attachment";
           output;
           ...
           };

   <b>Minimal</b> <b>Output</b>
       Minimal output includes only actions that modify packet data (not including  OVN  registers  or  metadata
       such  as  <b>outport</b>)  and  <b>output</b> actions that actually deliver a packet to a logical port (excluding patch
       ports). The operands of actions that modify packet data are displayed reduced to constants, e.g.  <b>ip4.dst</b>
       <b>=</b> <b>reg0;</b> might be show as <b>ip4.dst</b> <b>=</b> <b>192.168.0.1;</b> if that was the value actually loaded. This yields output
       even  simpler than the summary format. (Users familiar with Open vSwitch may recognize this as similar in
       spirit to the datapath actions listed at the bottom of <b>ofproto/trace</b> output.)

       The minimal output format reflects the externally seen behavior of the logical networks more than it does
       the implementation. This makes this output format the most suitable for use in regression tests,  because
       it is least likely to change when logical flow tables are rearranged without semantic change.

</pre><h4><b>STATEFUL</b> <b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Some  OVN logical actions use or update state that is not available in the southbound database. <b>ovn-trace</b>
       handles these actions as described below:

              <b>ct_next</b>
                     By default <b>ovn-trace</b> treats flows as ``tracked’’ and ``established.’’ See  the  description
                     of the <b>--ct</b> option for a way to override this behavior.

              <b>ct_dnat</b> (without an argument)
                     Forks  the pipeline. In one fork, advances to the next table as if <b>next;</b> were executed. The
                     packet is not changed, on the assumption that no NAT state  was  available.  In  the  other
                     fork, the pipeline continues without change after the <b>ct_dnat</b> action.

              <b>ct_snat</b> (without an argument)
                     This action distinguishes between gateway routers and distributed routers. A gateway router
                     is  defined  as  a  logical  datapath  that  contains  an <b>l3gateway</b> port; any other logical
                     datapath is a distributed router. On a gateway router, <b>ct_snat;</b> is treated as a no-op. On a
                     distributed router, it is treated the same way as <b>ct_dnat;</b>.

              <b>ct_dnat(</b><u>ip</u><b>)</b>
              <b>ct_snat(</b><u>ip</u><b>)</b>
                   Forks the pipeline. In one fork, sets <b>ip4.dst</b> (or <b>ip4.src</b>) to <u>ip</u> and <b>ct.dnat</b> (or <b>ct.snat</b>)  to
                   1  and  advances to the next table as if <b>next;</b> were executed. In the other fork, the pipeline
                   continues without change after the <b>ct_dnat</b> (or <b>ct_snat</b>) action.

              <b>ct_lb;</b>
              <b>ct_lb(</b><u>ip</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]...<b>);</b>
                   Forks the pipeline. In one fork, sets <b>ip4.dst</b>  (or  <b>ip6.dst</b>)  to  one  of  the  load-balancer
                   addresses  and  the  destination  port to its associated port, if any, and sets <b>ct.dnat</b> to 1.
                   With one or more arguments, gives preference to the address specified on  <b>--lb-dst</b>,  if  any;
                   without  arguments,  uses  the address and port specified on <b>--lb-dst</b>. In the other fork, the
                   pipeline continues without change after the <b>ct_lb</b> action.

              <b>ct_commit</b>
              <b>put_arp</b>
              <b>put_nd</b>
                   These actions are treated as no-ops.

</pre><h4><b>DAEMON</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       If <b>ovn-trace</b> is invoked with the <b>--detach</b> option (see <b>Daemon</b> <b>Options</b>, below), it runs in  the  background
       as a daemon and accepts commands from <b>ovs-appctl</b> (or another JSON-RPC client) indefinitely. The currently
       supported commands are described below.

              <b>trace</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>datapath</u>] <u>microflow</u>
                     Traces  <u>microflow</u>  through  <u>datapath</u> and replies with the results of the trace. Accepts the
                     <u>options</u> described under <b>Trace</b> <b>Options</b> below.

              <b>exit</b>   Causes <b>ovn-trace</b> to gracefully terminate.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Trace</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--detailed</b>
       <b>--summary</b>
       <b>--minimal</b>
            These options control the form and level of detail in <b>ovn-trace</b> output. If more than  one  of  these
            options  is  specified, all of the selected forms are output, in the order listed above, each headed
            by a banner line. If none of these options is given, <b>--detailed</b> is the default. See  <b>Output</b>,  above,
            for a description of each kind of output.

       <b>--all</b>
            Selects all three forms of output.

       <b>--ovs</b>[<b>=</b><u>remote</u>]
            Makes <b>ovn-trace</b> attempt to obtain and display the OpenFlow flows that correspond to each OVN logical
            flow.  To  do  so,  <b>ovn-trace</b>  connects  to <u>remote</u> (by default, <b>unix:/br-int.mgmt</b>) over OpenFlow and
            retrieves the flows. If <u>remote</u> is specified,  it  must  be  an  active  OpenFlow  connection  method
            described in <b><a href="../man7/ovsdb.7.html">ovsdb</a></b>(7).

            To  make  the best use of the output, it is important to understand the relationship between logical
            flows and OpenFlow flows. <b><a href="../man7/ovn-architecture.7.html">ovn-architecture</a></b>(7), under <b>Architectural</b> <b>Physical</b> <b>Life</b> <b>Cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b>  <b>Packet</b>,
            describes this relationship. Keep in mind the following points:

            •      <b>ovn-trace</b>  currently  shows  all the OpenFlow flows to which a logical flow corresponds, even
                   though an actual packet ordinarily matches only one of these.

            •      Some logical flows  can  map  to  the  Open  vSwitch  ``conjunctive  match’’  extension  (see
                   <b><a href="../man7/ovs-fields.7.html">ovs-fields</a></b>(7)).  Currently  <b>ovn-trace</b>  cannot display the flows with <b>conjunction</b> actions that
                   effectively produce the <b>conj_id</b> match.

            •      Some logical flows may not be represented in the OpenFlow tables on a  given  hypervisor,  if
                   they could not be used on that hypervisor.

            •      Some  OpenFlow  flows  do  not  correspond  to logical flows, such as OpenFlow flows that map
                   between physical and logical ports. These flows will never show up in a trace.

            •      When <b>ovn-trace</b> omits uninteresting logical flows  from  output,  it  does  not  look  up  the
                   corresponding OpenFlow flows.

       <b>--ct=</b><u>flags</u>
            This  option  sets the <b>ct_state</b> flags that a <b>ct_next</b> logical action will report. The <u>flags</u> must be a
            comma- or space-separated list of the following connection tracking flags:

            •      <b>trk</b>: Include to indicate connection tracking has taken place. (This bit is set  automatically
                   even if not listed in <u>flags</u>.

            •      <b>new</b>: Include to indicate a new flow.

            •      <b>est</b>: Include to indicate an established flow.

            •      <b>rel</b>: Include to indicate a related flow.

            •      <b>rpl</b>: Include to indicate a reply flow.

            •      <b>inv</b>: Include to indicate a connection entry in a bad state.

            •      <b>dnat</b>: Include to indicate a packet whose destination IP address has been changed.

            •      <b>snat</b>: Include to indicate a packet whose source IP address has been changed.

            The  <b>ct_next</b>  action  is  used  to  implement the OVN distributed firewall. For testing, useful flag
            combinations include:

            •      <b>trk,new</b>: A packet in a flow in either direction through a firewall  that  has  not  yet  been
                   committed (with <b>ct_commit</b>).

            •      <b>trk,est</b>: A packet in an established flow going out through a firewall.

            •      <b>trk,rpl</b>: A packet coming in through a firewall in reply to an established flow.

            •      <b>trk,inv</b>: An invalid packet in either direction.

            A  packet  might  pass  through the connection tracker twice in one trip through OVN: once following
            egress from a VM as it passes outward through a firewall, and once preceding ingress to a second  VM
            as  it passes inward through a firewall. Use multiple <b>--ct</b> options to specify the flags for multiple
            <b>ct_next</b> actions.

            When <b>--ct</b> is unspecified, or when there are fewer <b>--ct</b>  options  than  <b>ct_next</b>  actions,  the  <u>flags</u>
            default to <b>trk,est</b>.

       <b>--lb-dst=</b><u>ip</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]
            Sets  the  IP from VIP pool to use as destination of the packet. <b>--lb-dst</b> is not available in daemon
            mode.

       <b>--select-id=</b><u>id</u>
            Specify the <u>id</u> to be selected by the <b>select</b> action. <u>id</u> must be one  of  the  values  listed  in  the
            <b>select</b>  action.  Otherwise,  a  random  id  is  selected  from  the list, as if <b>--select-id</b> were not
            specified. <b>--select-id</b> is not available in daemon mode.

       <b>--friendly-names</b>
       <b>--no-friendly-names</b>
            When cloud management systems such as OpenStack are layered on top of  OVN,  they  often  use  long,
            human-unfriendly names for ports and datapaths, for example, ones that include entire UUIDs. They do
            usually  include  friendlier  names,  but  the  long, hard-to-read names are the ones that appear in
            matches and actions. By default, or with <b>--friendly-names</b>, <b>ovn-trace</b>  substitutes  these  friendlier
            names  for  the  long  names  in  its output. Use <b>--no-friendly-names</b> to disable this behavior; this
            option might be useful, for example, if a program is going to parse <b>ovn-trace</b> output.

   <b>Daemon</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--pidfile</b>[<b>=</b><u>pidfile</u>]
              Causes a file (by default, <u>program</u><b>.pid</b>) to be created indicating the PID of the  running  process.
              If the <u>pidfile</u> argument is not specified, or if it does not begin with <b>/</b>, then it is created in .

              If <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, no pidfile is created.

       <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b>
              By  default, when <b>--pidfile</b> is specified and the specified pidfile already exists and is locked by
              a running process, the daemon refuses to start. Specify <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b> to cause it to instead
              overwrite the pidfile.

              When <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, this option has no effect.

       <b>--detach</b>
              Runs this program as a background process. The process forks, and in the child  it  starts  a  new
              session,  closes  the standard file descriptors (which has the side effect of disabling logging to
              the console), and changes its current directory to the  root  (unless  <b>--no-chdir</b>  is  specified).
              After the child completes its initialization, the parent exits.

       <b>--monitor</b>
              Creates an additional process to monitor this program. If it dies due to a signal that indicates a
              programming  error  (<b>SIGABRT</b>,  <b>SIGALRM</b>,  <b>SIGBUS</b>,  <b>SIGFPE</b>,  <b>SIGILL</b>,  <b>SIGPIPE</b>,  <b>SIGSEGV</b>, <b>SIGXCPU</b>, or
              <b>SIGXFSZ</b>) then the monitor process starts a new copy of it. If the daemon dies or exits for another
              reason, the monitor process exits.

              This option is normally used with <b>--detach</b>, but it also functions without it.

       <b>--no-chdir</b>
              By default, when <b>--detach</b> is specified, the daemon changes its current working  directory  to  the
              root  directory  after  it  detaches.  Otherwise,  invoking  the  daemon  from a carelessly chosen
              directory would prevent the  administrator  from  unmounting  the  file  system  that  holds  that
              directory.

              Specifying  <b>--no-chdir</b>  suppresses  this behavior, preventing the daemon from changing its current
              working directory. This may be useful for collecting core files, since it is  common  behavior  to
              write core dumps into the current working directory and the root directory is not a good directory
              to use.

              This option has no effect when <b>--detach</b> is not specified.

       <b>--no-self-confinement</b>
              By  default  this  daemon  will  try  to  self-confine  itself to work with files under well-known
              directories determined at build time. It is better to stick with this default behavior and not  to
              use this flag unless some other Access Control is used to confine daemon. Note that in contrast to
              other  access  control  implementations that are typically enforced from kernel-space (e.g. DAC or
              MAC), self-confinement is imposed from the user-space  daemon  itself  and  hence  should  not  be
              considered  as a full confinement strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional layer of
              security.

       <b>--user=</b><u>user</u><b>:</b><u>group</u>
              Causes this program to run as a different user specified in <u>user</u><b>:</b><u>group</u>, thus dropping most of  the
              root privileges. Short forms <u>user</u> and <b>:</b><u>group</u> are also allowed, with current user or group assumed,
              respectively. Only daemons started by the root user accepts this argument.

              On  Linux,  daemons  will  be  granted <b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b> and <b>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES</b> before dropping root
              privileges. Daemons that interact with a datapath, such as <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>,  will  be  granted  three
              additional  capabilities,  namely <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>, <b>CAP_NET_BROADCAST</b> and <b>CAP_NET_RAW</b>. The capability
              change will apply even if the new user is root.

              On Windows, this option is not currently supported. For security reasons, specifying  this  option
              will cause the daemon process not to start.

   <b>Logging</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-v</b>[<u>spec</u>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<u>spec</u>]
            Sets  logging  levels. Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log level for every module and destination to <b>dbg</b>.
            Otherwise, <u>spec</u> is a list of words separated by spaces or commas or colons,  up  to  one  from  each
            category below:

            •      A  valid  module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b> command on <b><a href="../man8/ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl</a></b>(8), limits the log
                   level change to the specified module.

            •      <b>syslog</b>, <b>console</b>, or <b>file</b>, to limit the log level change to only to the  system  log,  to  the
                   console,  or  to  a  file,  respectively.  (If  <b>--detach</b>  is specified, the daemon closes its
                   standard file descriptors, so logging to the console will have no effect.)

                   On Windows platform, <b>syslog</b> is accepted  as  a  word  and  is  only  useful  along  with  the
                   <b>--syslog-target</b> option (the word has no effect otherwise).

            •      <b>off</b>,  <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to control the log level. Messages of the given severity
                   or higher will be logged, and messages of lower severity will be filtered  out.  <b>off</b>  filters
                   out all messages. See <b><a href="../man8/ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl</a></b>(8) for a definition of each log level.

            Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

            Regardless  of  the log levels set for <b>file</b>, logging to a file will not take place unless <b>--log-file</b>
            is also specified (see below).

            For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
            Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to <b>--verbose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
            Sets the log pattern for <u>destination</u> to <u>pattern</u>. Refer to <b><a href="../man8/ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl</a></b>(8) for  a  description  of  the
            valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
            Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. <u>facility</u> can be one of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>,
            <b>syslog</b>,  <b>lpr</b>,  <b>news</b>,  <b>uucp</b>,  <b>clock</b>,  <b>ftp</b>, <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>clock2</b>, <b>local0</b>, <b>local1</b>, <b>local2</b>, <b>local3</b>,
            <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b> or <b>local7</b>. If this option is not specified, <b>daemon</b> is used as the default for
            the local system syslog and <b>local0</b> is used while sending a message to the target  provided  via  the
            <b>--syslog-target</b> option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
            Enables logging to a file. If <u>file</u> is specified, then it is used as the exact name for the log file.
            The default log file name used if <u>file</u> is omitted is <b>/var/log/ovn/</b><u>program</u><b>.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><u>host</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>
            Send  syslog  messages  to  UDP  <u>port</u>  on <u>host</u>, in addition to the system syslog. The <u>host</u> must be a
            numerical IP address, not a hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><u>method</u>
            Specify <u>method</u> as how syslog messages should be sent to  syslog  daemon.  The  following  forms  are
            supported:

            •      <b>libc</b>,  to  use  the  libc <b>syslog()</b> function. Downside of using this options is that libc adds
                   fixed prefix to every message before it is actually sent to the syslog daemon  over  <b>/dev/log</b>
                   UNIX domain socket.

            •      <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>,  to use a UNIX domain socket directly. It is possible to specify arbitrary message
                   format with this option. However, <b>rsyslogd</b> <b>8.9</b> and  older  versions  use  hard  coded  parser
                   function  anyway  that  limits  UNIX  domain socket use. If you want to use arbitrary message
                   format with older <b>rsyslogd</b> versions, then use UDP socket to localhost IP address instead.

            •      <b>udp:</b><u>ip</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>, to use a UDP socket. With this method it is possible to  use  arbitrary  message
                   format  also  with  older  <b>rsyslogd</b>.  When  sending  syslog  messages  over  UDP socket extra
                   precaution needs to be taken into account, for example, syslog daemon needs to be  configured
                   to  listen  on  the  specified  UDP port, accidental iptables rules could be interfering with
                   local syslog traffic and there are some security considerations that apply  to  UDP  sockets,
                   but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

            •      <b>null</b>, to discard all messages logged to syslog.

            The default is taken from the <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b> environment variable; if it is unset, the default is
            <b>libc</b>.

   <b>PKI</b> <b>Options</b>
       PKI configuration is required to use SSL/TLS for the connection to the database (and the switch, if <b>--ovs</b>
       is specified).

              <b>-p</b> <u>privkey.pem</u>
              <b>--private-key=</b><u>privkey.pem</u>
                   Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used as identity for outgoing SSL/TLS
                   connections.

              <b>-c</b> <u>cert.pem</u>
              <b>--certificate=</b><u>cert.pem</u>
                   Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the private key specified on  <b>-p</b>
                   or  <b>--private-key</b>  to  be  trustworthy.  The  certificate  must  be signed by the certificate
                   authority (CA) that the peer in SSL/TLS connections will use to verify it.

              <b>-C</b> <u>cacert.pem</u>
              <b>--ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
                   Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate for verifying  certificates  presented  to
                   this  program  by  SSL/TLS peers. (This may be the same certificate that SSL/TLS peers use to
                   verify the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or <b>--certificate</b>,  or  it  may  be  a  different  one,
                   depending on the PKI design in use.)

              <b>-C</b> <b>none</b>
              <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
                   Disables  verification of certificates presented by SSL/TLS peers. This introduces a security
                   risk, because it means that certificates cannot be verified to  be  those  of  known  trusted
                   hosts.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--db</b> <u>database</u>
              The  OVSDB  database remote to contact. If the <b>OVN_SB_DB</b> environment variable is set, its value is
              used as the default. Otherwise, the default is <b>unix:/db.sock</b>, but this default is unlikely  to  be
              useful outside of single-machine OVN test environments.

              <b>-h</b>
              <b>--help</b>
                   Prints a brief help message to the console.

              <b>-V</b>
              <b>--version</b>
                   Prints version information to the console.
