</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       netplugd — network cable hotplug management daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>netplugd</b> [<b>-FP</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>config_file</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>script_file</u>] [<b>-i</b> <u>interface_pattern</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>pid_file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>netplugd</b>  is  a  daemon  that  responds  to  network link events from the Linux kernel, such as a network
       interface losing or acquiring a carrier signal.

       When an Ethernet-style network interface on a host is plugged into a powered-up  switch,  hub,  or  other
       host,  the  two  use  a  carrier signal to establish that the link is alive.  The Linux kernel makes this
       information available through its <u><a href="../man7/netlink.7.html">netlink</a></u>(7) interface.

       The <b>netplugd</b> daemon listens for  carrier  detection  and  loss  messages  from  the  kernel's  <u><a href="../man7/netlink.7.html">netlink</a></u>(7)
       subsystem.   When  a  carrier signal is detected on an interface, it runs a script to bring the interface
       up.  When carrier is lost, <b>netplugd</b> runs a script to bring the interface down.  <b>netplugd</b> does not  define
       any  policies  for how to manage interfaces; it leaves that to a script, <u>/etc/netplug.d/netplug</u>, which is
       described in “FILES” below.

       You tell <b>netplugd</b> which interfaces it should manage by giving it a list  of  shell-style  glob  patterns,
       which  it  matches  against  using  the <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3) function.  For example, a pattern of <u>eth[13]</u> will tell
       <b>netplugd</b> to only manage <u>eth1</u> and <u>eth3</u>, if those interfaces exist.  If the interfaces are not known to the
       kernel at the time you start <b>netplugd</b>, perhaps because they are unplugged PCMCIA  network  interfaces  or
       devices whose drivers have not yet been installed, <b>netplugd</b> will start to manage them as soon as they are
       plugged in or their drivers are available.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-F</b>      Run  in  the  foreground;  do  not  detach and run as a daemon.  Messages are logged to <u>stdout</u> or
               <u>stderr</u>, instead of using the <u><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></u>(3) mechanism.  This option is  useful  mainly  for  debugging
               your configuration.

       <b>-P</b>      Prevent  autoprobing  for  interfaces.   The  <b>netplugd</b>  daemon  normally  probes for all possible
               interface names that might match the patterns you tell it to manage.  This is necessary in  order
               to  get  network  driver modules (the default with almost all Linux distributions) loaded and set
               up, so that they can provide link status  notifications  to  the  <b>netplugd</b>  daemon.   Autoprobing
               should always be safe, and doesn't take long.  Disable it with caution.

       <b>-c</b> <u>config_file</u>
               Specify  the  name  of a file from which to read patterns that describe the interfaces to manage.
               You can provide this option multiple times to read from more  than  one  file.   If  you  do  not
               provide  this option at all, <b>netplugd</b> will attempt to read from a default config file.  If you do
               not want <b>netplugd</b> to try to read from any real config files,  you  can  specify  <u>/dev/null</u>  as  a
               config file.

       <b>-s</b> <u>script_file</u>
               Specify an alternative script file path, override /etc/netplug.d/netplug

       <b>-i</b> <u>interface_pattern</u>
               Specify  a  pattern  that will be used to match interface names that <b>netplugd</b> should manage.  You
               can provide this option multiple times to specify multiple patterns.

       <b>-p</b> <u>pid_file</u>
               Write the daemon's process ID to the  file  <u>pid_file</u>.   If  you  tell  <b>netplugd</b>  to  run  in  the
               foreground, this option is ignored.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/netplug/netplugd.conf</u>
               Default config file to read, if none is specified on the command line.  The config file format is
               one  pattern  per  line,  with white space, empty lines, and comments starting with a <b>#</b> character
               ignored.  Patterns are standard shell-style glob patterns, e.g. "eth[0-9]".

       <u>/etc/netplug.d/netplug</u>
               The "policy" program (typically a shell script) that <b>netplugd</b> uses to probe for  interfaces,  and
               to  bring  them  up  or down in response to network link events.  This program is called with the
               name of the interface as its first argument, and one of the following options:

               in      A cable was plugged in, or carrier came up.  The command should bring the  interface  up.
                       The command is run asynchronously, and it should exit with status 0 on success.

               out     A  cable  was  plugged out, or carrier went down.  The command should bring the interface
                       down.  The command is run asynchronously, and it should exit with status 0 on success.

               probe   The command should load and initialise the driver for this interface,  if  possible,  and
                       bring  the interface into the "up" state, so that it can generate <u><a href="../man7/netlink.7.html">netlink</a></u>(7) events.  The
                       command is run synchronously; it must exit with status code 0 if it  succeeds,  otherwise
                       with a non-zero exit code or signal.

       <u>/etc/init.d/netplug</u>
               The <u><a href="../man8/init.8.html">init</a></u>(8) script that starts, stops, and displays status of the <b>netplugd</b> daemon.
