       rear - bare metal disaster recovery and system migration tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rear</b> [<b>-h</b>|<b>--help</b>] [<b>-V</b>|<b>--version</b>] [<b>-dsSv</b>] [<b>-D</b>|<b>--debugscripts</b> <u>SET</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>DIR</u>] [<b>-C</b> <u>CONFIG</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>KERNEL</u>] [--]
       <u>COMMAND</u> [<u>ARGS</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Relax-and-Recover (abbreviated ReaR) is the leading Open Source disaster recovery solution. It is a
       modular framework with many ready-to-go workflows for common situations.

       Relax-and-Recover produces a bootable image. This image can repartition the system. Once that is done it
       initiates a restore from backup. Restores to different hardware are possible. Relax-and-Recover can
       therefore be used as a migration tool as well.

       Currently Relax-and-Recover supports various boot media (incl. ISO, PXE, OBDR tape, USB or eSATA
       storage), a variety of network protocols (incl. sftp, ftp, http, nfs, cifs) for storage and backup as
       well as a multitude of backup strategies (incl. IBM Tivoli Storage Manager, MircoFocus Data Protector,
       Symantec NetBackup, EMC NetWorker, EMC Avamar, FDR/Upstream, NovaStor DC, Rubrik Cloud Data Management
       (CDM), Bareos, Bacula, rsync, rbme, Borg). This results in a bootable image that is capable of booting
       via PXE, DVD/CD, bootable tape or virtual provisioning.

       Relax-and-Recover was designed to be easy to set up, requires no maintenance and is there to assist when
       disaster strikes. Its setup-and-forget nature removes any excuses for not having a disaster recovery
       solution implemented.

       Recovering from disaster is made very straight-forward by a 2-step recovery process so that it can be
       executed by operational teams when required. When used interactively (e.g. when used for migrating
       systems), menus help make decisions to restore to a new (hardware) environment.

       Extending Relax-and-Recover is made possible by its modular framework. Consistent logging and optionally
       extended output help understand the concepts behind Relax-and-Recover and help debug during development.

</pre><h4><b>BACKGROUND</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       The process of bare metal disaster recovery consists of two parts:

       •   Recreate the system layout

       •   Restore the data to the system

       Most backup software solutions are very good at restoring data but do not support recreating the system
       layout. Relax-and-Recover is very good at recreating the system layout but works best when used together
       with supported backup software.

       In this combination Relax-and-Recover recreates the system layout and calls the backup software to
       restore the actual data. Thus there is no unnecessary duplicate data storage and the Relax-and-Recover
       rescue media can be very small.

       For demonstration and special use purposes Relax-and-Recover also includes an internal backup method,
       NETFS, which can be used to create a simple tar.gz archive of the system. For all permanent setups we
       recommend using something more professional for backup, either a traditional backup software (open source
       or commercial) or rsync with hardlink based solutions, e.g. RSYNC BACKUP MADE EASY.

</pre><h4><b>RESCUE</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The OUTPUT variable defines from where our bootable rescue image will be booted and the OUTPUT_URL
       variable defines where the rescue image should be send to. Possible OUTPUT settings are:

       OUTPUT=<b>RAMDISK</b>
           Create only the Relax-and-Recover initramfs.

       OUTPUT=<b>ISO</b>
           <b>(Default)</b> Create a bootable ISO9660 image on disk as <u>rear-$(hostname).iso</u>

       OUTPUT=<b>PXE</b>
           Create on a remote PXE/NFS server the required files (such as configuration file, kernel and initrd
           image)

       OUTPUT=<b>OBDR</b>
           Create a bootable OBDR tape (optionally including the backup archive). Specify the OBDR tape device
           by using TAPE_DEVICE.

       OUTPUT=<b>USB</b>
           Create a bootable USB disk.

       OUTPUT=<b>RAWDISK</b>
           Create a bootable image file named "rear-$(hostname).raw.gz", which

           •   supports UEFI boot if syslinux/EFI or Grub 2/EFI is installed,

           •   supports Legacy BIOS boot if syslinux is installed,

           •   supports UEFI/Legacy BIOS dual boot if syslinux <b>and</b> one of the supported EFI bootloaders are
               installed.

       When using OUTPUT=ISO, RAMDISK, OBDR, USB, or RAWDISK you should provide the backup target location
       through the OUTPUT_URL variable. Possible OUTPUT_URL settings are:

       OUTPUT_URL=<b>file://</b>
           Write the image to disk. The default is in <u>/var/lib/rear/output/</u>.

       OUTPUT_URL=<b>nfs://</b>
           Write the image by mounting the target filesystem via NFS.

       OUTPUT_URL=<b>cifs://</b>
           Write the image by mounting the target filesystem via CIFS.

       OUTPUT_URL=<b>fish://</b>
           Write the image using lftp and the FISH protocol.

       OUTPUT_URL=<b>ftp://</b>
           Write the image using lftp and the FTP protocol.

       OUTPUT_URL=<b>ftps://</b>
           Write the image using lftp and the FTPS protocol.

       OUTPUT_URL=<b>hftp://</b>
           Write the image using lftp and the HFTP protocol.

       OUTPUT_URL=<b>http://</b>
           Write the image using lftp and the HTTP (PUT) procotol.

       OUTPUT_URL=<b>https://</b>
           Write the image using lftp and the HTTPS (PUT) protocol.

       OUTPUT_URL=<b>sftp://</b>
           Write the image using lftp and the secure FTP (SFTP) protocol.

       OUTPUT_URL=<b>rsync://</b>
           Write the image using rsync and the RSYNC protocol.

       OUTPUT_URL=<b>sshfs://</b>
           Write the image using sshfs and the SSH protocol.

       OUTPUT_URL=<b>null</b>
           Do not copy the rescue image from <u>/var/lib/rear/output/</u> to a remote output location. OUTPUT_URL=null
           is useful when another program (e.g. an <u>external</u> backup program) is used to save the rescue image
           from the local system to a remote place, or with BACKUP_URL=iso:///backup when the backup is included
           in the rescue image to avoid a (big) copy of the rescue image at a remote output location. In the
           latter case the rescue image must be manually saved from the local system to a remote place.
           OUTPUT_URL=null is only supported together with BACKUP=NETFS.

       If you do not specify OUTPUT_URL variable then by default it will be aligned to what was defined by
       variable BACKUP_URL. And, the rescue image will then be copied to the same location as your backup of the
       system disk(s).

       The ISO_DEFAULT variable defines what default boot option is used on the rescue image. Possible values
       are manual, boothd or automatic. Manual will make you boot into the shell directly by default, boothd
       will boot to the first disk (default) or automatic will automatically start in recovery mode.

</pre><h4><b>RESCUE</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>KERNEL</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       When booting the rescue image you can edit the kernel command line. There are some Relax-and-Recover
       specific kernel command line options:

       <b>debug</b>
           The rescue system start up scripts in /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/ are run one by one each one after
           pressing 'Enter' and the scripts are run with 'set -x' which prints commands and their arguments as
           they are executed.

       <b>auto_recover</b> or <b>automatic</b>
           Launch 'rear recover' automatically (without automated reboot). Together with 'debug' it runs 'rear
           recover' in debug mode.

       <b>unattended</b>
           Launch 'rear recover' automatically as with 'auto_recover' plus automated reboot after successful
           'rear recover'.

       <b>ip=</b> <b>nm=</b> <b>netdev=</b> <b>gw=</b>
           If IP address plus optionally netmask (default 255.255.255.0), network device (default eth0), and a
           default gateway are specified only that single network device is set up. Example:

           ip=192.168.100.2 nm=255.255.255.0 netdev=eth0 gw=192.168.100.1

       <b>noip</b>
           Skip network devices setup by the rescue system start up scripts (overrides ip= nm= netdev= gw=).

</pre><h4><b>BACKUP</b> <b>SOFTWARE</b> <b>INTEGRATION</b></h4><pre>
       Currently Relax-and-Recover supports the following backup methods. There is a distinction between
       Relax-and-Recover support for 3rd party backup software and Relax-and-Recover internal backup methods.
       The latter also creates a backup of your data while the former will only integrate Relax-and-Recover with
       the backup software to restore the data with the help of the backup software without actually creating
       backups. This means that for all non-internal backup software you <b>must</b> take care of creating backups
       yourself (unless otherwise noted).

       Especially the rear mkbackup command can be confusing as it is only useful for the internal backup
       methods and has usually no function at all with the other (external) backup methods.

       The following backup methods need to be set in Relax-and-Recover with the BACKUP option. As mentioned we
       have two types of BACKUP methods - <u>internal</u> and <u>external</u>.

       The following BACKUP methods are <u>external</u> of Relax-and-Recover meaning that usually you are responsible
       of backups being made:

       BACKUP=<b>REQUESTRESTORE</b>
           <b>(default)</b> Not really a backup method at all, Relax-and-Recover simply halts the recovery and requests
           that somebody will restore the data to the appropriate location (e.g. via SSH). This method works
           especially well with an rsync based backup that is pushed back to the backup client.

       BACKUP=<b>EXTERNAL</b>
           Internal backup method that uses an arbitrary external command to create a backup and restore the
           data.

       BACKUP=<b>DP</b>
           Use Micro Focus Data Protector to restore the data.

       BACKUP=<b>FDRUPSTREAM</b>
           Use FDR/Upstream to restore the data.

       BACKUP=<b>GALAXY</b>
           Use CommVault Galaxy 5 to restore the data.

       BACKUP=<b>GALAXY7</b>
           Use CommVault Galaxy 7 to restore the data.

       BACKUP=<b>GALAXY10</b>
           Use CommVault Galaxy 10 (or Simpana 10) to restore the data.

       BACKUP=<b>NBU</b>
           Use Symantec NetBackup to restore the data.

       BACKUP=<b>TSM</b>
           Use IBM Tivoli Storage Manager to restore the data. The Relax-and-Recover result files (e.g. ISO
           image) are also saved into TSM. There is a (currently experimental) first draft implementation that a
           TSM backup is created by calling 'dsmc incremental' during 'rear mkbackup'.

       BACKUP=<b>NSR</b>
           Using EMC NetWorker (Legato) to restore the data.

       BACKUP=<b>AVA</b>
           Using EMC Avamar to restore the data.

       BACKUP=<b>SESAM</b>
           Using SEP Sesam to restore the data.

       BACKUP=<b>NBKDC</b>
           Using NovaStor DC to restore the data.

       BACKUP=<b>CDM</b>
           Using Rubrik Cloud Data Management (CDM) to restore the data.

       BACKUP=<b>RBME</b>
           Use Rsync Backup Made Easy (rbme) to restore the data.

       BACKUP=<b>BAREOS</b>
           Use Open Source backup solution BAREOS (a fork a BACULA) to restore the data.

       BACKUP=<b>BACULA</b>
           Use Open Source backup solution BACULA to restore the data.

       BACKUP=<b>DUPLICITY</b>
           Use encrypted bandwidth-efficient backup solution using the rsync algorithm to restore the data.

       BACKUP=<b>BORG</b>
           Use BorgBackup (short Borg) a deduplicating backup program to restore the data. Executing 'rear
           mkbackup' will create a Borg backup, see the section 'ReaR with Borg back end' in the ReaR user-guide
           'Scenarios' documentation.

       The following BACKUP methods are <u>internal</u> of Relax-and-Recover:

       BACKUP=<b>NETFS</b>
           Internal backup method which can be used to create a simple backup (tar archive).

       BACKUP=<b>RSYNC</b>
           Use rsync to restore data.

       If your favourite backup software is missing from this list, please submit a patch or ask us to implement
       it for you.

       When using BACKUP=NETFS you must provide the backup target location through the BACKUP_URL variable.
       Possible BACKUP_URL settings are:

       BACKUP_URL=<b>file://</b>
           To backup to local disk, use BACKUP_URL=file:///directory/path/

       BACKUP_URL=<b>nfs://</b>
           To backup to NFS disk, use BACKUP_URL=nfs://nfs-server-name/share/path

       BACKUP_URL=<b>tape://</b>
           To backup to tape device, use BACKUP_URL=tape:///dev/nst0 or alternatively, simply define
           TAPE_DEVICE=/dev/nst0

       BACKUP_URL=<b>rsync://</b>
           When backup method BACKUP=RSYNC is chosen then we need to define a corresponding BACKUP_URL rule:

               BACKUP_URL=rsync://[user@]host[:port]/path
               BACKUP_URL=rsync://[user@]host[:port]::/path

       BACKUP_URL=<b>cifs://</b>
           To backup to a Samba share (CIFS), use BACKUP_URL=cifs://cifs-server-name/share/path. To provide
           credentials for CIFS mounting use a <u>/etc/rear/cifs</u> credentials file and define
           BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/cifs" and pass along:

               username=_username_
               password=_secret password_
               domain=_domain_

       BACKUP_URL=<b>usb://</b>
           To backup to USB storage device, use BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000 or use a partition
           device node or a specific filesystem label. Alternatively, you may specify the partition device using
           USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000 if needed.

           If you combine this with OUTPUT=USB you will end up with a bootable USB device.

       BACKUP_URL=<b>sshfs://</b>
           To backup to a remote server via sshfs (SSH protocol), use
           BACKUP_URL=sshfs://<a href="mailto:user@remote-system.name.org">user@remote-system.name.org</a>/home/user/backupdir/

           It is advisable to add <b>ServerAliveInterval</b> <b>15</b> in the /root/.ssh/config file for the remote system
           (remote-system.name.org).

       BACKUP_URL=<b>iso://</b>
           To include the backup within the ISO image. It is important that the BACKUP_URL and OUTPUT_URL
           variables are different. E.g.

               BACKUP_URL=iso:///backup/
               OUTPUT_URL=nfs://server/path/

       When using BACKUP=NETFS and BACKUP_PROG=tar there is an option to select BACKUP_TYPE=incremental or
       BACKUP_TYPE=differential to let rear make incremental or differential backups until the next full backup
       day e.g. via FULLBACKUPDAY="Mon" is reached or when the last full backup is too old after
       FULLBACKUP_OUTDATED_DAYS has passed. Incremental or differential backup is currently only known to work
       with BACKUP_URL=nfs. Other BACKUP_URL schemes may work but at least BACKUP_URL=usb requires USB_SUFFIX to
       be set to work with incremental or differential backup.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>SELF-ENCRYPTING</b> <b>DISKS</b></h4><pre>
       Relax-and-Recover supports self-encrypting disks (SEDs) compliant with the TCG Opal 2 specification if
       the sedutil-cli executable is installed.

       Self-encrypting disk support includes

       •   recovery (saving and restoring the system’s SED configuration),

       •   setting up SEDs, including assigning a disk password,

       •   providing a pre-boot authentication (PBA) system to unlock SEDs at boot time.

       To prepare booting from an SED, run rear mkopalpba, then create the rescue system.

       To set up an SED, boot the Relax-and-Recover rescue system and run rear opaladmin setupERASE DEVICE
       (<u>DEVICE</u> being the disk device path like /dev/sda).

       For complete information, consult the section "Support for TCG Opal 2-compliant Self-Encrypting Disks" in
       the Relax-and-Recover user guide.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       To configure Relax-and-Recover you have to edit the configuration files in <u>/etc/rear/</u>. All <u>*.conf</u> files
       there are part of the configuration, but only <u>site.conf</u> and <u>local.conf</u> are intended for the user
       configuration. All other configuration files hold defaults for various distributions and should not be
       changed.

       In <u>/etc/rear/templates/</u> there are also some template files which are used by Relax-and-Recover to create
       configuration files (mostly for the boot environment). Modify the templates to adjust the information
       contained in the emails produced by Relax-and-Recover. You can use these templates to prepend your own
       configurations to the configuration files created by Relax-and-Recover, for example you can edit
       <u>PXE_pxelinux.cfg</u> to add some general pxelinux configuration you use.

       In almost all circumstances you have to configure two main settings and their parameters: The backup
       method and the output method.

       The backup method defines, how your data is to be saved and whether Relax-and-Recover should backup your
       data as part of the mkrescue process or whether you use an external application, e.g. backup software to
       archive your data.

       The output method defines how the rescue system is written to disk and how you plan to boot the failed
       computer from the rescue system.

       See the default configuration file <u>/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf</u> for an overview of the possible
       methods and their options.

       An example to use TSM for backup and ISO for output would be to add these lines to <u>/etc/rear/local.conf</u>
       (no need to define a BACKUP_URL when using an external backup solution):

           BACKUP=TSM
           OUTPUT=ISO

       And if all your systems use NTP for time synchronisation, you can also add these lines to
       <u>/etc/rear/site.conf</u>

           TIMESYNC=NTP

       Do not forget to distribute the <u>site.conf</u> to all your systems.

       The resulting ISO image will be created in <u>/var/lib/rear/output/</u>. You can now modify the behaviour by
       copying the appropriate configuration variables from <u>default.conf</u> to <u>local.conf</u> and changing them to suit
       your environment.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       0
           Successful program execution.

       &gt;0
           Usage, syntax or execution errors. Check the log file in <u>/var/log/rear/</u> for more information.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To print out the current settings for BACKUP and OUTPUT methods and some system information. This command
       can be used to see the supported features for the given release and platform.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The ReaR project was initiated in 2006 by Schlomo Schapiro (https://github.com/schlomo) and Gratien
       D’haese (https://github.com/gdha) and has since then seen a lot of contributions by many authors. As ReaR
       deals with bare metal disaster recovery, there is a large amount of code that was contributed by owners
       and users of specialized hardware and software. Without their combined efforts and contributions ReaR
       would not be the universal Linux bare metal disaster recovery solution that it is today.

       As time passed the project was lucky to get the support of additional developers to also help as
       maintainers: Dag Wieers (https://github.com/dagwieers), Jeroen Hoekx (https://github.com/jhoekx),
       Johannes Meixner (https://github.com/jsmeix), Vladimir Gozora (https://github.com/gozora), Sebastien
       Chabrolles (https://github.com/schabrolles), Renaud Metrich (https://github.com/rmetrich) and Pavel
       Cahyna (https://github.com/pcahyna). We hope that ReaR continues to prove useful and to attract more
       developers who agree to be maintainers. Refer to the MAINTAINERS
       (https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/MAINTAINERS) file for the list of active and past maintainers.

       To see the full list of authors and their contributions look at the git history
