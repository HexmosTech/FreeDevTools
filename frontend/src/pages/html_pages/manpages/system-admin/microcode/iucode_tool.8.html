</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       iucode_tool - Tool to manipulate Intel® IA‐32/X86‐64 microcode bundles

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>iucode_tool</b> [<u>options</u>] [[-t<u>type</u>] <u>filename</u>|<u>dirname</u>] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>iucode_tool</b>  is  an  utility  that  can  load Intel® processor microcode data from files in both text and
       binary microcode bundle formats.

       It can output a list of the microcodes in these files, merge them, upload them to the kernel (to  upgrade
       the  microcode  in  the  system processor cores) or write some of them out to a file in binary format for
       later use.

       <b>iucode_tool</b> will load all microcodes in the specified files  and  directories  to  memory,  in  order  to
       process  them.   Duplicated  and  outdated microcodes will be discarded.  It can read microcode data from
       standard input (<u>stdin</u>), by specifying a file name of “-” (minus sign).

       Microcode data files are assumed to be in .dat text format if they have a  .dat  suffix,  and  to  be  in
       binary format otherwise.  Standard input (<u>stdin</u>) is assumed to be in .dat text format.  The <u>-t</u> option can
       be used to change the type of the files specified after it, including for <u>stdin</u>.

       If a directory is specified, all files whose names do not begin with a dot will be loaded, in unspecified
       order.  Nested directories are skipped.

       Empty files and directories are ignored, and will be skipped.

       You can select which microcodes should be written out, listed or uploaded to the kernel using the <u>-S</u>, <u>-s</u>,
       <u>--date-before</u>  and  <u>--date-after</u> options.  Should none of those options be specified, all microcodes will
       be selected.

       You can upload the selected microcodes to the kernel, write them out to a file (in binary format),  to  a
       Linux early initramfs archive, to per‐processor‐signature files in a directory, or to per‐microcode files
       in a directory using the <u>-w</u>, <u>--write-earlyfw</u>, <u>-k</u>, <u>-K</u>, and <u>-W</u> options.

       <b>iucode_tool</b>  will  identify microcodes in its output and error messages using a “<u>n/k</u>” notation, where “<u>n</u>”
       is the bundle number, and “<u>k</u>” is the microcode number within that bundle.  The output of  the  <u>--list-all</u>
       option when processing multiple input files is the best example of how it works.

       For  more  information  about  Intel processor microcodes, please read the included documentation and the
       Intel manuals listed in the <u>SEE</u> <u>ALSO</u> section.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>iucode_tool</b> accepts the following options:

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Inhibit usual output.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Print more information.  Use more than once for added verbosity.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              List all available options and their meanings.

       <b>--usage</b>
              Show summary of options.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Show version of program.

       <b>-t</b> <u>type</u>
              Sets the file type of the following files. <u>type</u> can be:

              <b>b</b>      binary format.  This is the same format used by the kernel driver and the  BIOS/EFI,  which
                     is described in detail by the <u>Intel</u> <u>64</u> <u>and</u> <u>IA‐32</u> <u>Architectures</u> <u>Software</u> <u>Developer's</u> <u>Manual,</u>
                     <u>Volume</u> <u>3A</u>, section 9.11.

              <b>d</b>      Intel  microcode .dat text format.  This is the format normally used by Intel to distribute
                     microcode data files.

              <b>r</b>      recover  microcode  in  binary  format.   Search  uncompressed  generic  binary  files  for
                     microcodes  in  Intel microcode binary format to recover.  Note: It can find microcode that
                     will not pass strict checks, and thus cause <b>iucode_tool</b> to exit if  the  <u>--no-strict-checks</u>
                     or <u>--ignore-broken</u> options are not in effect.

              <b>a</b>      (default)  <b>iucode_tool</b>  will  use the suffix of the file name to select the file type: .dat
                     text format for files that have a <u>.dat</u> suffix, and binary type otherwise.   Note  that  for
                     <u>stdin</u>, .dat text format is assumed.

       <b>--downgrade</b>
              When  multiple  versions  of  the  microcode for a specific processor are available from different
              files, keep the one from the file loaded last, regardless of revision levels.   Files  are  always
              loaded  in the order they were specified in the command line.  This option has no effect when just
              one file has been loaded.

       <b>--no-downgrade</b>
              When multiple versions of the microcode for a specific  processor  are  available  from  different
              files, keep the one with the highest revision level.  This is the default mode of operation.

       <b>--strict-checks</b>
              Perform strict checks on the microcode data.  It will refuse to load microcodes and microcode data
              files  with unexpected size and metadata.  It will also refuse to load microcode entries that have
              the same metadata, but different payload.  This is the default mode of operation.

       <b>--no-strict-checks</b>
              Perform less strict checks on the microcode data.  Use  only  if  you  happen  to  come  across  a
              microcode  data file that has microcodes with weird sizes or incorrect non‐critical metadata (such
              as invalid dates), which  you  want  to  retain.   If  you  just  want  to  skip  those,  use  the
              <u>--ignore-broken</u> option.

       <b>--ignore-broken</b>
              Skip  broken  microcode  entries  when  loading a microcode data file, instead of aborting program
              execution.  If the microcode entry has an unsupported format or had its header severely corrupted,
              all remaining data in the file will have to be ignored.  In  that  case,  using  a  file  type  of
              <u>recover</u>  <u>microcode</u> <u>in</u> <u>binary</u> <u>format</u> (<u>-tr</u> option) is recommended, as it can skip over badly mangled
              microcode data.

       <b>--no-ignore-broken</b>
              Abort program execution if a broken microcode is found while loading a microcode data file.   This
              is the default mode of operation.

       <b>-s</b> <b>!</b> <b>|</b> <b>[!]</b><u>signature</u><b>[,[</b><u>pf_mask</u><b>][,[</b><u>lt:</u><b>|</b><u>eq:</u><b>|</b><u>gt:</u><b>]</b><u>revision</u><b>]]</b>
              Select microcodes by the specified <u>signature</u>, <u>processor</u> <u>flags</u> <u>mask</u> (<u>pf_mask</u>), and <u>revision</u>.

              If  the <u>processor</u> <u>flags</u> <u>mask</u> is specified, it will select only microcodes that are suitable for at
              least one of the processor flag combinations present in the mask.

              If the <u>revision</u> is specified, optionally prefixed by one of the “<u>eq:</u>”, “<u>lt:</u>” or  “<u>gt:</u>”  operators,
              it  will  select  only  microcodes  that  have that same <u>revision</u> (if no operator, or if the “<u>eq:</u>”
              operator is used), or microcodes that have a <u>revision</u> that  is  less  than  (“<u>lt:</u>”  operator),  or
              greater than (“<u>gt:</u>” operator), the one specified.

              Specify  more  than  once  to  select  more  microcodes.   This  option  can  be combined with the
              <u>--scan-system</u> option to select more microcodes.  If <u>signature</u> is prefixed with a “<u>!</u>”  (exclamation
              mark),  it  will  deselect microcodes instead.  Ordering matters, with later <u>-s</u> options overriding
              earlier ones, including <u>--scan-system</u>.

              When specifying <u>signature</u> and <u>pf_mask</u>, hexadecimal numbers must be prefixed with “<u>0x</u>”,  and  octal
              numbers  with  “<u>0</u>”.   Decimal  numbers  must  not  have  leading  zeros,  otherwise  they would be
              interpreted as octal numbers.

              The special notation <u>-s!</u> (with no <u>signature</u> parameter) instructs <b>iucode_tool</b> to  require  explicit
              inclusion of microcode signatures (using the non-negated form of <u>-s</u>, or using <u>--scan-system</u>).

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--scan-system</b>[=<u>mode</u>]
              Select microcodes by scanning online processors on this system for their signatures.

              This  option  can  be  used  only  once,  and it can be combined with the <u>-s</u> option to select more
              microcodes.  The  microcodes  selected  by  <u>--scan-system</u>  can  also  be  deselected  by  a  later
              <u>-s</u> <u>!signature</u> option.

              The  optional <u>mode</u> argument (accepted only by the long version of the option) selects the strategy
              used to scan processors:

              <b>0</b> or <b>auto</b>
                     Currently the same as <b>fast</b>, but this might change in future versions if Intel ever  deploys
                     multi‐signature  systems  that  go  beyond  mixed‐stepping.   This  is  the default mode of
                     operation, for backwards compatibility with previous versions of <b>iucode_tool</b>.

              <b>1</b> or <b>fast</b>
                     Uses the cpuid instruction to detect the signature of the processor <b>iucode_tool</b> is  running
                     on, and selects all steppings for that processor's type, family and model.  Supports mixed‐
                     stepping systems.

              <b>2</b> or <b>exact</b>
                     Uses  kernel  drivers  to scan the signature of every online processor directly.  This mode
                     supports multi‐signature systems.  This scan mode will be slow on large systems  with  many
                     processors,  and  likely  requires  special permissions (such as running as the root user).
                     Should the scan fail for any reason, as a fail‐safe measure, it will issue an  warning  and
                     consider all possible steppings for every signature it did manage to scan successfully.

       <b>--date-before</b>=<u>YYYY-MM-DD</u> and <b>--date-after</b>=<u>YYYY-MM-DD</u>
              Limit  the  selected  microcodes by a date range.  The date must be given in ISO format, with four
              digits for the year and two digits for the month and day and “<u>-</u>” (minus sign) for  the  separator.
              Dates are not range‐checked, so you can use <u>--date-after=2000-00-00</u> to select all microcodes dated
              since January 1st, 2000.

       <b>--loose-date-filtering</b>
              When  a  date  range is specified, all revisions of the microcode will be considered for selection
              (ignoring just the date range, all other filters  still  apply)  should  any  of  the  microcode's
              revisions be within the date range.

       <b>--strict-date-filtering</b>
              When  a  date range is specified, select only microcodes which are within the date range.  This is
              the default mode of operation.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
              List selected microcode signatures to standard output (<u>stdout</u>).

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--list-all</b>
              List all microcode signatures while they're being processed to standard output (<u>stdout</u>).

       <b>-k</b>[<u>device</u>], <b>--kernel</b>[=<u>device</u>]
              Upload selected microcodes to the kernel.  Optionally, the device path can be specified  (default:
              <u>/dev/cpu/microcode</u>).   This  update  method  is deprecated: it will be removed eventually from the
              kernel and from iucode_tool.

       <b>-K</b>[<u>directory</u>], <b>--write-firmware</b>[=<u>directory</u>]
              Write selected microcodes with the file names  expected  by  the  Linux  kernel  firmware  loader.
              Optionally, the destination directory can be specified (default: <u>/lib/firmware/intel‐ucode</u>).

       <b>-w</b><u>file</u>, <b>--write-to</b>=<u>file</u>
              Write selected microcodes to a file in binary format.

       <b>--write-earlyfw</b>=<u>file</u>
              Write  selected microcodes to an early initramfs archive, which should be prepended to the regular
              initramfs to allow the kernel to update processor microcode very early during system boot.

       <b>-W</b><u>directory</u>, <b>--write-named-to</b>=<u>directory</u>
              Write selected microcodes to the specified directory, one microcode per file,  in  binary  format.
              The file names reflect the microcode signature, processor flags mask and revision.

       <b>--write-all-named-to</b>=<u>directory</u>
              Write  every  microcode to the specified directory, one microcode per file, in binary format.  The
              file names reflect the microcode signature, processor flags mask and revision.  This is  the  only
              way to write out every revision of the same microcode.

       <b>--overwrite</b>
              Remove  the destination file before writing, if it exists and is not a directory.  The destination
              file is not overwritten in‐place.  Hardlinks will be severed, and any existing access permissions,
              ACLs and other extended attributes of the old destination file will be lost.

       <b>--no-overwrite</b>
              Abort if the destination file already exists.  This is the default mode  of  operation.   Do  note
              that iucode_tool does not follow non‐directory symlinks when writing files.

       <b>--mini-earlyfw</b>
              Optimize  the early initramfs cpio container for minimal size.  It will change the cpio block size
              to 16 bytes, and remove header entries for the parent directories of the microcode data file.   As
              a  result, the microcode data file will not be available to the regular initramfs, and tools might
              complain about the non‐standard cpio block size.

              This will typically reduce the early initramfs size by 736 bytes.

       <b>--normal-earlyfw</b>
              Optimize the early initramfs size for tool compatibility.  This is the default mode of  operation.
              The microcode data file will be available inside the regular initramfs as well.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>iucode_tool</b>  reads  all  data  to  memory  before  doing any processing.  It enforces a sanity limit of a
       maximum of 1GiB worth of binary microcode data per microcode data file.

       All informational and error messages are sent to standard error  (<u>stderr</u>),  while  user‐requested  output
       (such as output generated by the list options) is sent to standard output (<u>stdout</u>).

       <b>iucode_tool</b> creates files with permissions 0644 (rw-r--r--), modified by the current umask.

       <b>iucode_tool</b>'s  selected  microcode  listing  and  microcode  output  files  are sorted first by <u>processor</u>
       <u>signature</u> (in ascending order), and then by <u>processor</u> <u>flags</u> <u>mask</u> (in descending order).

       When multiple revisions of a microcode are selected, the older ones will be  skipped.   Only  the  newest
       selected  revision  of  a microcode (or the last one in load order when the <u>--downgrade</u> option is active)
       will be written to a file or uploaded to the kernel.

       Intel microcode data files, both in binary and text formats, can be concatenated to generate a bigger and
       still valid microcode data file.

       <b>iucode_tool</b> does not follow symlinks when writing microcode data files.  It will either refuse  to  write
       the file and abort (default mode of operation), or (when the <u>--overwrite</u> option is active) it will remove
       the target symlink or file (and therefore breaking hardlinks) <u>before</u> writing the new file.

       <b>iucode_tool</b> does follow directory symlinks to locate the directory to write files into.

   <b>Linux</b> <b>Notes</b>
       Before  Linux v4.4, the microcode update driver was split in two parts: the early microcode update driver
       (which gets microcode data from the initramfs) and the late microcode update driver,  which  could  be  a
       module and got microcode data from the firmware subsystem.  The two drivers were unified in Linux v4.4.

       The  microcode  update  driver needs to be present in the system at all times to ensure microcode updates
       are reapplied on resume from suspend and CPU hotplug.  Do not unload the  microcode  module,  unless  you
       really  know  better.   Since  Linux  v4.4, the late microcode driver cannot be a module anymore and will
       always be present in the system when enabled.

       Updating microcode early is safer.  It can only be done at boot and it requires an initramfs, but  it  is
       strongly recommended: late microcode updates (which read microcode data from /lib/firmware) cannot safely
       change visible processor features.

       Early  microcode  updates  are  available  since  Linux  v3.9.   They can safely change visible processor
       features (such as the microcode updates that disabled Intel TSX instructions on Intel Haswell cores  do).
       They    require    an    uncompressed    initramfs    image   with   the   microcode   update   data   in
       <u>/kernel/x86/microcode/GenuineIntel.bin</u>.   This  uncompressed  initramfs  image  must  come   before   any
       compressed initramfs image(s), and it has an special name: <u>early</u> <u>initramfs</u>.

       The microcode update data inside the early initramfs image must be aligned to a 16‐byte boundary due to a
       bug  in  several versions of the Linux kernel early microcode update driver.  This requires special steps
       when creating the initramfs archive with the microcode data, and will be  handled  automatically  by  the
       <b>iucode_tool</b> <u>--write-earlyfw</u> option.

       Since  Linux  v4.2,  it  is  also  possible  to build a kernel with the microcode update data as built‐in
       firmware, using the CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL facility.  This feature is  not  yet  mature  as  of  Linux
       v4.2.8, v4.4.11, v4.5.5 and v4.6, and might not work in every case.

       The  <u>/dev/cpu/microcode</u>  update interface has been deprecated and should not be used.  It has one special
       requirement: each write syscall must contain whole microcode(s).  It can be accessed through  <b>iucode_tool</b>
       <u>--kernel</u>.

       Up  to Linux v3.5, late microcode updates were required to be triggered per‐core, by writing the number 1
       to <u><a href="file:/sys/devices/system/cpu/">/sys/devices/system/cpu/</a>*/microcode/reload</u> for every cpu.   Depending  on  kernel  version,  you  must
       either  trigger  it  on  every  core  to  avoid a dangerous situation where some cores are using outdated
       microcode, or the kernel will accept the request only for the boot processor and use  it  to  trigger  an
       update on all system processor cores.

       Since Linux v3.6, the late microcode update driver has a new interface that explicitly triggers an update
       for every core at once when the number 1 is written to <u>/sys/devices/system/cpu/microcode/reload</u>.

       Microcode  with  negative  revision  numbers is not special‐cased, and will not be preferred over regular
       microcode.

       The <u>downgrade</u> <u>mode</u> should be used only for microcodes with the same  <u>processor</u>  <u>flags</u>  <u>mask</u>.   It  cannot
       handle  the  corner cases where modifying a <u>processor</u> <u>flags</u> <u>mask</u> would be required to force the kernel to
       load a lower revision of a microcode, and <b>iucode_tool</b> will issue an warning when that happens.   So  far,
       this  has  not  proved to be a relevant limitation as changes to the <u>processor</u> <u>flags</u> <u>mask</u> of post‐launch,
       production microcode updates are very rare.

       The <u>loader</u> <u>version</u> microcode metadata field is ignored by <b>iucode_tool</b>.  This shouldn't cause problems  as
       long as the same signature never needs more than a single type of loader.

       Files  are not replaced atomically: if <b>iucode_tool</b> is interrupted while writing to a file, that file will
       be corrupted.
