       saslauthd — sasl authentication server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>saslauthd</b> <b>-a</b> <u>authmech</u> [<b>-Tvdchlr</b>] [<b>-O</b> <u>option</u>] [<b>-m</b> <u>mux_path</u>] [<b>-n</b> <u>threads</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>size</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>saslauthd</b>  is  a  daemon  process  that  handles  plaintext authentication requests on behalf of the SASL
       library.

       The server fulfills two roles: it isolates all code requiring superuser privileges into a single process,
       and it can be used to provide <u>proxy</u> authentication services to clients that do not understand SASL  based
       authentication.

       <b>saslauthd</b>  should  be  started  from  the system boot scripts when going to multi-user mode. When running
       against a protected authentication database (e.g. the <b>shadow</b> mechanism), it must be run as the superuser.
       Otherwise it is recommended to run  daemon  unprivileged  as  saslauth:saslauth,  requiring  the  runtime
       directory  to  have  root:saslauthd  owner.  You  can  do  so  by following these steps in machines using
       <u><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></u>(1) :

       1.   create directory <u>/etc/systemd/system/saslauthd.service.d/</u>
       2.   create file <u>/etc/systemd/system/saslauthd.service.d/user.conf</u> with content

            [Service]
            User=saslauth
            Group=saslauth

       3.   Reload systemd service file: run “systemctl daemon-reload”

   <b>Options</b>
       Options named by lower-case letters configure the server itself.  Upper-case options control the behavior
       of specific authentication mechanisms; their applicability to a particular  authentication  mechanism  is
       described in the “AUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS” section.

       <b>-a</b> <u>authmech</u>
               Use  <u>authmech</u>  as  the  authentication  mechanism.  (See  the “AUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS” section
               below.) This parameter is mandatory.

       <b>-O</b> <u>option</u>
               A mechanism specific option (e.g. rimap hostname or config file path)

       <b>-H</b> <u>hostname</u>
               The remote host to be contacted by  the  <b>rimap</b>  authentication  mechanism.  (Deprecated,  use  -O
               instead)

       <b>-m</b> <u>path</u>
               Use  <u>path</u>  as the pathname to the named socket to listen on for connection requests. This must be
               an absolute pathname, and MUST NOT include the trailing "/mux".  Note that the default  for  this
               value  is  "/var/state/saslauthd" (or what was specified at compile time) and that this directory
               must exist for saslauthd to function.

       <b>-n</b> <u>threads</u>
               Use <u>threads</u> processes for responding to authentication queries. (default: 5)   A  value  of  zero
               will  indicate  that  saslauthd  should fork an individual process for each connection.  This can
               solve leaks that occur in some deployments.

       <b>-s</b> <u>size</u>
               Use <u>size</u> as the table size of the hash table (in kilobytes)

       <b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u>
               Use <u>timeout</u> as the expiration time of the authentication cache (in seconds)

       <b>-T</b>      Honour time-of-day login restrictions.

       <b>-h</b>      Show usage information

       <b>-c</b>      Enable caching of authentication credentials

       <b>-l</b>      Disable the use of a lock file for controlling access to accept().

       <b>-r</b>      Combine the realm with the login (with an '@' sign in between).  e.g.  login: "foo" realm:  "bar"
               will get passed as login: "foo@bar".  Note that the realm will still be passed, which may lead to
               unexpected  behavior  for  authentication  mechanisms  that  make  use  of the realm, however for
               mechanisms which don't, such as <u>getpwent</u>, this is the only way  to  authenticate  domain-specific
               users sharing the same userid.

       <b>-v</b>      Print the version number and available authentication mechanisms on standard error, then exit.

       <b>-d</b>      Debugging mode.

   <b>Logging</b>
       <b>saslauthd</b> logs its activities via <b>syslogd</b> using the LOG_AUTH facility.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHENTICATION</b> <b>MECHANISMS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>saslauthd</b> supports one or more "authentication mechanisms", dependent upon the facilities provided by the
       underlying  operating  system.   The  mechanism  is  selected  by  the <b>-a</b> flag from the following list of
       choices:

       <b>dce</b>        <u>(AIX)</u>

                  Authenticate using the DCE authentication environment.

       <b>getpwent</b>   <u>(All</u> <u>platforms)</u>

                  Authenticate using the <b>getpwent</b>() library function. Typically this authenticates  against  the
                  local password file. See your system's <u><a href="../man3/getpwent.3.html">getpwent</a></u>(3) man page for details.

       <b>kerberos4</b>  <u>(All</u> <u>platforms)</u>

                  Authenticate  against  the  local Kerberos 4 realm. (See the “NOTES” section for caveats about
                  this driver.)

       <b>kerberos5</b>  <u>(All</u> <u>platforms)</u>

                  Authenticate against the local Kerberos 5 realm.

       <b>pam</b>        <u>(Linux,</u> <u>Solaris)</u>

                  Authenticate using Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM).

       <b>rimap</b>      <u>(All</u> <u>platforms)</u>

                  Forward authentication requests to a remote IMAP server. This driver connects to a remote IMAP
                  server, specified using the -O flag, and attempts to login (via an IMAP ‘LOGIN’ command) using
                  the credentials supplied to the local server. If the remote authentication succeeds the  local
                  connection  is also considered to be authenticated. The remote connection is closed as soon as
                  the tagged response from the ‘LOGIN’ command is received from the remote server.

                  The <u>option</u> parameter to the <b>-O</b> flag describes the  remote  server  to  forward  authentication
                  requests  to.   <u>hostname</u>  can  be  a  hostname  (imap.example.com) or a dotted-quad IP address
                  (192.168.0.1). The latter is useful if the  remote  server  is  multi-homed  and  has  network
                  interfaces  that  are  unreachable from the local IMAP server. The remote host is contacted on
                  the ‘imap’ service port. A non-default port can be specified by appending a slash and the port
                  name or number to the <u>hostname</u> argument.

                  The <b>-O</b> flag and argument are mandatory when using the <b>rimap</b> mechanism.

       <b>shadow</b>     <u>(AIX,</u> <u>Irix,</u> <u>Linux,</u> <u>Solaris)</u>

                  Authenticate against the  local  "shadow  password  file".   The  exact  mechanism  is  system
                  dependent.   <b>saslauthd</b>  currently understands the <b>getspnam</b>() and <b>getuserpw</b>() library routines.
                  Some systems honour the <b>-T</b> flag.

       <b>sasldb</b>     <u>(All</u> <u>platforms)</u>

                  Authenticate against the SASL authentication database.  Note that this is  probably  not  what
                  you  want  to use, and is even disabled at compile-time by default.  If you want to use sasldb
                  with the SASL library, you probably want to use the pwcheck_method of "auxprop" along with the
                  sasldb auxprop plugin instead.

       <b>ldap</b>       <u>(All</u> <u>platforms</u> <u>that</u> <u>support</u> <u>OpenLDAP</u> <u>2.0</u> <u>or</u> <u>higher)</u>

                  Authenticate against an  ldap  server.   The  ldap  configuration  parameters  are  read  from
                  /etc/saslauthd.conf.   The location of this file can be changed with the -O parameter. See the
                  LDAP_SASLAUTHD file included  in  the  cyrus-sasl2-doc  package  for  the  list  of  available
                  parameters.

       <b>sia</b>        <u>(Digital</u> <u>UNIX)</u>

                  Authenticate  using  the  Digital  Unix  Security  Integration Architecture (a.k.a.  "enhanced
                  security").

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>kerberos4</b> authentication driver consumes considerable resources. To perform an authentication it must
       obtain a ticket granting ticket from the TGT server <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>authentication</b> <b>request.</b> The Kerberos library
       routines that obtain the TGT also create a local ticket file, on the reasonable assumption that you  will
       want to save the TGT for use by other Kerberos applications. These ticket files are unusable by <b>saslauthd</b>
       ,  however  there  is no way not to create them. The overhead of creating and removing these ticket files
       can cause serious performance degradation on busy servers. (Kerberos was never intended  to  be  used  in
       this manner, anyway.)

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/var/run/saslauthd/mux</u>  The default communications socket.

       <u>/etc/saslauthd.conf</u>     The default configuration file for ldap support.
