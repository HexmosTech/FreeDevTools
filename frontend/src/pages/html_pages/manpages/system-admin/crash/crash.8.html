       crash - Analyze Linux crash dump data or a live system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>crash</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... <u>NAMELIST</u> <u>MEMORY-IMAGE[@ADDRESS]</u>    <u>(dumpfile</u> <u>form)</u>
       <b>crash</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... <u>[NAMELIST]</u>                         <u>(live</u> <u>system</u> <u>form)</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Crash</b> is a tool for interactively analyzing the state of the Linux system while it is running, or after a
       kernel crash has occurred and a core dump has been created by the <u>netdump,</u> <u>diskdump,</u> <u>LKCD,</u> <u>kdump,</u> <u>xendump</u>
       <u>kvmdump</u>  or  <u>VMware</u>  facilities.   It  is  loosely  based  on  the  SVR4 UNIX crash command, but has been
       significantly enhanced by completely merging it with  the  <b><a href="../man1/gdb.1.html">gdb</a>(1)</b>  debugger.  The  marriage  of  the  two
       effectively  combines  the  kernel-specific  nature of the traditional UNIX crash utility with the source
       code level debugging capabilities of <b><a href="../man1/gdb.1.html">gdb</a>(1).</b>

       In the <u>dumpfile</u> <u>form,</u> both a NAMELIST and a MEMORY-IMAGE argument must be entered.  In  the  <u>live</u>  <u>system</u>
       <u>form,</u>  the  NAMELIST  argument  must  be  entered  if the kernel's <u>vmlinux</u> file is not located in a known
       location, such as the <u>/usr/lib/debug/lib/modules/&lt;kernel-version&gt;</u> directory.

       The <b>crash</b> utility has also been extended to support the analysis of dumpfiles generated by a crash of the
       Xen hypervisor.  In that case, the NAMELIST argument must be that of the <u>xen-syms</u>  binary.   Live  system
       analysis is not supported for the Xen hypervisor.

       The  <b>crash</b>  utility  command  set consists of common kernel core analysis tools such as kernel stack back
       traces of all processes, source code disassembly,  formatted  kernel  structure  and  variable  displays,
       virtual  memory  data,  dumps  of  linked-lists, etc., along with several commands that delve deeper into
       specific kernel subsystems.  Appropriate <b>gdb</b> commands may also be entered, which in turn are passed on to
       the <b>gdb</b> module for execution.  If desired, commands may be placed in either a <u>$HOME/.crashrc</u> file  and/or
       in  a  <u>.crashrc</u> file in the current directory.  During initialization, the commands in <u>$HOME/.crashrc</u> are
       executed first, followed by those in the <u>./.crashrc</u> file.

       The <b>crash</b> utility is designed to be independent of Linux version dependencies.  When  new  kernel  source
       code  impacts  the  correct  functionality  of  <b>crash</b> and its command set, the utility will be updated to
       recognize new kernel code changes, while maintaining backwards compatibility with earlier releases.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NAMELIST</b>
              This is a pathname to an uncompressed kernel image (a <u>vmlinux</u> file), or a Xen hypervisor image  (a
              <u>xen-syms</u>  file)  which  has  been  compiled  with  the "-g" option.  If using the <u>dumpfile</u> <u>form,</u> a
              <u>vmlinux</u> file may be compressed in either gzip or bzip2 formats.

       <b>MEMORY-IMAGE[@ADDRESS]</b>
              A kernel core dump file created by the <u>netdump,</u> <u>diskdump,</u> <u>LKCD</u> <u>kdump,</u> <u>xendump</u>  <u>kvmdump</u>  or  <u>VMware</u>
              facilities.

              If  a  MEMORY-IMAGE argument is not entered, the session will be invoked on the live system, which
              typically requires root privileges because of the device file  used  to  access  system  RAM.   By
              default,  <u>/dev/crash</u> will be used if it exists.  If it does not exist, then <u>/dev/mem</u> will be used;
              but if the kernel has been configured with <b>CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM,</b> then <u><a href="file:/proc/kcore">/proc/kcore</a></u>  will  be  used.
              It is permissible to explicitly enter <u>/dev/crash,</u> <u>/dev/mem</u> or <u>/proc/kcore.</u>

              An  @ADDRESS value must be appended to the MEMORY-IMAGE if the dumpfile is a raw RAM dumpfile that
              has no header information describing the file  contents.   Multiple  MEMORY-IMAGE@ADDRESS  ordered
              pairs  may  be entered, with each dumpfile containing a contiguous block of RAM, where the ADDRESS
              value is the physical start address of the block expressed in hexadecimal.  The  physical  address
              value(s)  will  be used to create a temporary ELF header in <a href="file:/var/tmp">/var/tmp</a>, which will only exist during
              the crash session.  If a raw RAM dumpile represents a live memory source, such as  that  specified
              by  the  QEMU mem-path argument of a memory-backend-file object, then "live:" must be prepended to
              the MEMORY-IMAGE name.

              As VMware facility, the <b>crash</b> utility is able to process VMware VM memory  dump  generated  by  VM
              suspend  or  guest  core dump. In that case, .vmss or .guest file should be used as a MEMORY-IMAGE
              and .vmem file must be located in the same folder.

       <b>mapfile</b>
              If the NAMELIST file is not the same kernel that is running (live system form), or the kernel that
              was running when the system crashed (dumpfile form), then the  <u>System.map</u>  file  of  the  original
              kernel should be entered on the command line.

       <b>-h</b> <u>[option]</u>
       <b>--help</b> <u>[option]</u>
              Without an <u>option</u> argument, display a <b>crash</b> usage help message.  If the <u>option</u> argument is a <b>crash</b>
              command  name,  the  help page for that command is displayed.  If it is the string "input", a page
              describing the various <b>crash</b> command line input  options  is  displayed.   If  it  is  the  string
              "output",  a page describing command line output options is displayed.  If it is the string "all",
              then all of the possible help messages are displayed.  After the help message is displayed,  <b>crash</b>
              exits.

       <b>-s</b>     Silently  proceed  directly  to  the "crash&gt;" prompt without displaying any version, GPL, or <b>crash</b>
              initialization data during startup, and by default, runtime command output is not  passed  to  any
              scrolling command.

       <b>-i</b> <u>file</u>
              Execute  the  command(s) contained in <u>file</u> prior to displaying the "crash&gt;" prompt for interactive
              user input.

       <b>-d</b> <u>num</u> Set the internal debug level.  The higher the number, the more debugging data will be printed when
              <b>crash</b> initializes and runs.

       <b>-S</b>     Use <u>/boot/System.map</u> as the <u>mapfile</u>.

       <b>-e</b> <u>vi</u> <u>|</u> <u>emacs</u>
              Set the <b><a href="../man3/readline.3.html">readline</a>(3)</b> command line editing mode to "vi" or "emacs".  The  default  editing  mode  is
              "vi".

       <b>-f</b>     Force the usage of a compressed <u>vmlinux</u> file if its original name does not start with "vmlinux".

       <b>-k</b>     Indicate that the NAMELIST file is an LKCD "Kerntypes" debuginfo file.

       <b>-g</b> <u>[namelist]</u>
              Determine if a <u>vmlinux</u> or <u>xen-syms</u> namelist file contains debugging data.

       <b>-t</b>     Display the system-crash timestamp and exit.

       <b>-L</b>     Attempt    to    lock    all   of   its   virtual   address   space   into   memory   by   calling
              mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE) during initialization.   If  the  system  call  fails,  an  error
              message will be displayed, but the session continues.

       <b>-c</b> <u>tty-device</u>
              Open the <u>tty-device</u> as the console used for debug messages.

       <b>-p</b> <u>page-size</u>
              If  a processor's page size cannot be determined by the dumpfile, and the processor default cannot
              be used, use <u>page-size.</u>

       <b>-o</b> <u>filename</u>
              Only used with the MEMORY-IMAGE@ADDRESS format for raw RAM dumpfiles, specifies a  filename  of  a
              new  ELF  vmcore  that will be created and used as the dumpfile.  It will be saved to allow future
              use as a standalone vmcore, replacing the original raw RAM dumpfile.

       <b>-m</b> <u>option=value</u>
       <b>--machdep</b> <u>option=value</u>
              Pass an option and value pair to machine-dependent code.  These architecture-specific option/pairs
              should only be required in very rare circumstances:

              <u>/usr/lib64/crash/extensions</u>   (64-bit   architectures)   or   <u>/usr/lib/crash/extensions</u>    (32-bit
              architectures) will be used; if they do not exist, then the <u>./extensions</u> <u>directory</u> <u>will</u> <u>be</u> <u>used.</u>

       <b>--active</b>
              Track only the active task on each cpu.

       <b>--buildinfo</b>
              Display  the  crash  binary's  build date, the user ID of the builder, the hostname of the machine
              where the build was done, the target architecture, the version number, and the compiler version.

       <b>--memory_module</b> <u>modname</u>
              Use the <u>modname</u> as an alternative kernel module to the <u>crash.ko</u> module that creates the <u>/dev/crash</u>
              device.

       <b>--memory_device</b> <u>device</u>
              Use <u>device</u> as an alternative device to the <u>/dev/crash,</u> <u>/dev/mem</u> or <u><a href="file:/proc/kcore">/proc/kcore</a></u> devices.

       <b>--log</b> <u>dumpfile</u>
              Dump the contents of the kernel log buffer.  A kernel namelist argument is not necessary, but  the
              dumpfile  must contain the VMCOREINFO data taken from the original /proc/vmcore ELF header.  Note:
              this option is deprecated and will no longer work for kernel(&gt;=v5.10).

       <b>--no_kallsyms</b>
              Do not use kallsyms-generated symbol information contained within kernel module object files.

       <b>--no_modules</b>
              Do not access or display any kernel module related information.

       <b>--no_ikconf</b>
              Do  not  attempt  to  read  configuration  data  that  was  built  into  kernels  configured  with
              <b>CONFIG_IKCONFIG.</b>

       <b>--no_data_debug</b>
              Do not verify the validity of all structure member offsets and structure sizes that it uses.

       <b>--no_kmem_cache</b>
              Do not initialize the kernel's slab cache infrastructure, and commands that use kmem_cache-related
              data will not work.

       <b>--no_elf_notes</b>
              Do  not  use  the  registers from the ELF NT_PRSTATUS notes saved in a compressed kdump header for
              backtraces.

       <b>--kmem_cache_delay</b>
              Delay the initialization of the kernel's slab cache infrastructure until it is required by a  run-
              time command.

       <b>--readnow</b>
              Pass this flag to the embedded <b>gdb</b> module, which will override its two-stage strategy that it uses
              for reading symbol tables from the NAMELIST.

       <b>--smp</b>  Specify that the system being analyzed is an SMP kernel.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Display the version of the <b>crash</b> utility, the version of the embedded <b>gdb</b> module, GPL information,
              and copyright notices.

       <b>--cpus</b> <u>number</u>
              Specify the <u>number</u> of cpus in the SMP system being analyzed.

       <b>--osrelease</b> <u>dumpfile</u>
              Display the OSRELEASE vmcoreinfo string from a kdump <u>dumpfile</u> header.

       <b>--hyper</b>
              Force the session to be that of a Xen hypervisor.

       <b>--p2m_mfn</b> <u>pfn</u>
              When  a  Xen Hypervisor or its dom0 kernel crashes, the dumpfile is typically analyzed with either
              the Xen hypervisor or the dom0 kernel.  It is also possible to  analyze  any  of  the  guest  domU
              kernels  if  the  pfn_to_mfn_list_list <u>pfn</u> value of the guest kernel is passed on the command line
              along with its NAMELIST and the dumpfile.

       <b>--xen_phys_start</b> <u>physical-address</u>
              Supply the base physical address of the Xen hypervisor's text and static data  for  older  xendump
              dumpfiles that did not pass that information in the dumpfile header.

       <b>--zero_excluded</b>
              If  the <a href="../man8/makedumpfile.8.html">makedumpfile</a>(8) facility has filtered a compressed kdump dumpfile to exclude various types
              of non-essential pages, or has marked a compressed or ELF kdump dumpfile as incomplete due  to  an
              ENOSPC or other error during its creation, any attempt to read missing pages will fail.  With this
              flag, reads from any of those pages will return zero-filled memory.

       <b>--no_panic</b>
              Do not attempt to find the task that was running when the kernel crashed.  Set the initial context
              to that of the "swapper" task on cpu 0.

       <b>--more</b> Use  <u><a href="file:/bin/more">/bin/more</a></u>  as  the  command  output scroller, overriding the default of <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?less">/usr/bin/less</a></u> and any
              settings in either <u>./.crashrc</u> or <u>$HOME/.crashrc.</u>

       <b>--less</b> Use <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?less">/usr/bin/less</a></u> as the command output scroller, overriding any settings in either <u>./.crashrc</u>  or
              <u>$HOME/.crashrc.</u>

       <b>--hex</b>  Set  the  default  command  output  radix to 16, overriding the default radix of 10, and any radix
              settings in either <u>./.crashrc</u> or <u>$HOME/.crashrc.</u>

       <b>--dec</b>  Set the default command output radix to 10, overriding any radix settings in either <u>./.crashrc</u>  or
              <u>$HOME/.crashrc.</u> <u>This</u> <u>is</u> <u>the</u> <u>default</u> <u>radix</u> <u>setting.</u>

       <b>--CRASHPAGER</b>
              Use the output paging command defined in the <b>CRASHPAGER</b> shell environment variable, overriding any
              settings in either <u>./.crashrc</u> or <u>$HOME/.crashrc.</u>

       <b>--no_scroll</b>
              Do not pass run-time command output to any scrolling command.

       <b>--no_strip</b>
              Do not strip cloned kernel text symbol names.

       <b>--no_crashrc</b>
              Do not execute the commands in either <u>$HOME/.crashrc</u> or <u>./.crashrc.</u>

       <b>--mod</b> <u>directory</u>
              When loading the debuginfo data of kernel modules with the <u>mod</u> <u>-S</u> command, search for their object
              files in <u>directory</u> instead of in the standard location.

       <b>--src</b> <u>directory</u>
              Search  for  the  kernel  source  code  in  directory  instead of in the standard location that is
              compiled into the debuginfo data.

       <b>--kaslr</b> <u>offset</u><b>|</b><u>auto</u>
              If an x86, x86_64, s390x or loongarch64 kernel  was  configured  with  <b>CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE,</b>  the
              offset  value  is equal to the difference between the symbol values compiled into the vmlinux file
              and their relocated KASLR values.  If set to auto, the KASLR offset value  will  be  automatically
              calculated.

       <b>--reloc</b> <u>size</u>
              When  analyzing  live  x86 kernels that were configured with a <b>CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START</b> value that is
              larger than its <b>CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN</b> value, then it will be necessary to enter a relocation  size
              equal to the difference between the two values.

       <b>--hash</b> <u>count</u>
              Set the number of internal hash queue heads used for list gathering and verification.  The default
              count is 32768.

       <b>--minimal</b>
              Bring up a session that is restricted to the <u>log,</u> <u>dis,</u> <u>rd,</u> <u>sym,</u> <u>eval,</u> <u>set</u> and <u>exit</u> commands.  This
              option  may  provide a way to extract some minimal/quick information from a corrupted or truncated
              dumpfile, or in situations where one of the several kernel subsystem initialization routines would
              abort the <b>crash</b> session.

       <b>--kvmhost</b> <u>[32|64]</u>
              When examining an x86 KVM guest dumpfile, this option specifies that the KVM host that created the
              dumpfile was an  x86  (32-bit)  or  an  x86_64  (64-bit)  machine,  overriding  the  automatically
              determined value.

       <b>--kvmio</b> <u>&lt;size&gt;</u>
              override the automatically-calculated KVM guest I/O hole size.

       <b>--offline</b> <u>[show|hide]</u>
              Show or hide command output that is related to offline cpus.  The default setting is show.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Each <b>crash</b> command generally falls into one of the following categories:

       <u>Symbolic</u> <u>display</u>
              Displays  of kernel text/data, which take full advantage of the power of <b>gdb</b> to format and display
              data structures symbolically.

       <u>System</u> <u>state</u>
              The majority of <b>crash</b> commands consist of a set  of  "kernel-aware"  commands,  which  delve  into
              various kernel subsystems on a system-wide or per-task basis.

       <u>Utility</u> <u>functions</u>
              A set of useful helper commands serving various purposes, some simple, others quite powerful.

       <u>Session</u> <u>control</u>
              Commands that control the <b>crash</b> session itself.

       The following alphabetical list consists of a very simple overview of each <b>crash</b> command.  However, since
       individual  commands  often  have  several  options  resulting  in  significantly different output, it is
       suggested that the full description of each command be viewed by executing <u>crash</u> <u>-h</u> <u>&lt;command&gt;,</u> or  during
       a <b>crash</b> session by simply entering <u>help</u> <u>command</u><b>.</b>

       <u>*</u>      "pointer  to" is shorthand for either the <u>struct</u> or <u>union</u> commands.  It displays the contents of a
              kernel structure or union.

       <u>alias</u>  creates a single-word alias for a command.

       <u>ascii</u>  displays an ascii chart or translates a numeric value into its ascii components.

       <u>bpf</u>    provides information on currently-loaded eBPF programs and maps.

       <u>bt</u>     displays a task's kernel-stack backtrace.  If it is given the <u>-a</u> option,  it  displays  the  stack
              traces  of the active tasks on all CPUs.  It is often used with the <u>foreach</u> command to display the
              backtraces of all tasks with one command.

       <u>btop</u>   translates a byte value (physical offset) to its page number.

       <u>dev</u>    displays data concerning the character and block device assignments, I/O port  usage,  I/O  memory
              usage, and PCI device data.

       <u>dis</u>    disassembles  memory,  either  entire  kernel functions, from a location for a specified number of
              instructions, or from the start of a function up to a specified memory location.

       <u>eval</u>   evaluates an expression or numeric type and displays the result in hexadecimal, decimal, octal and
              binary.

       <u>exit</u>   causes <b>crash</b> to exit.

       <u>extend</u> dynamically loads or unloads <b>crash</b> shared object extension modules.

       <u>files</u>  displays information about open files in a context.

       <u>foreach</u>
              repeats a specified command for the specified (or all) tasks in the system.

       <u>fuser</u>  displays the tasks using the specified file or socket.

       <u>gdb</u>    passes its argument to the embedded <b>gdb</b> module.  It is useful for executing <b>gdb</b> commands that have
              the same name as <b>crash</b> commands.

       <u>help</u>   alone displays the command menu; if followed by a command name, a full description of  a  command,
              its options, and examples are displayed.  Its output is far more complete and useful than this man
              page.

       <u>ipcs</u>   displays data about the System V IPC facilities.

       <u>irq</u>    displays data concerning interrupt request numbers and bottom-half interrupt handling.

       <u>kmem</u>   displays information about the use of kernel memory.

       <u>list</u>   displays the contents of a linked list.

       <u>log</u>    displays the kernel log_buf contents in chronological order.

       <u>mach</u>   displays data specific to the machine type.

       <u>mod</u>    displays  information about the currently installed kernel modules, or adds or deletes symbolic or
              debugging information about specified kernel modules.

       <u>mount</u>  displays information about the currently-mounted filesystems.

       <u>net</u>    display various network related data.

       <u>p</u>      passes its arguments to the <b>gdb</b> "print" command for evaluation and display.

       <u>ps</u>     displays process status for specified, or all, processes in the system.

       <u>pte</u>    translates the hexadecimal contents of a PTE into its physical page address and page bit settings.

       <u>ptob</u>   translates a page frame number to its byte value.

       <u>ptov</u>   translates a hexadecimal physical address into a kernel virtual address.

       <u>q</u>      is an alias for the "exit" command.

       <u>rd</u>     displays the contents of memory, with the output formatted in several different manners.

       <u>repeat</u> repeats a command indefinitely, optionally delaying a given number of seconds between each command
              execution.

       <u>runq</u>   displays the tasks on the run queue.

       <u>sbitmapq</u>
              dumps the contents of the sbitmap_queue structure and the used bits in the bitmap. Also, it  shows
              the dump of a structure array associated with the sbitmap_queue.

       <u>search</u> searches a range of user or kernel memory space for given value.

       <u>set</u>    either sets a new context, or gets the current context for display.

       <u>sig</u>    displays signal-handling data of one or more tasks.

       <u>struct</u> displays  either  a  structure  definition  or  the  contents of a kernel structure at a specified
              address.

       <u>swap</u>   displays information about each configured swap device.

       <u>sym</u>    translates a symbol to its virtual address, or a static kernel virtual address to its symbol -- or
              to a symbol-plus-offset value, if appropriate.

       <u>sys</u>    displays system-specific data.

       <u>task</u>   displays the contents of a task_struct.

       <u>tree</u>   displays the contents of a red-black tree or a radix tree.

       <u>timer</u>  displays the timer queue entries, both old- and new-style, in chronological order.

       <u>union</u>  is similar to the <u>struct</u> command, except that it works on kernel unions.

       <u>vm</u>     displays basic virtual memory information of a context.

       <u>vtop</u>   translates a user or kernel virtual address to its physical address.

       <u>waitq</u>  walks the wait queue list displaying the tasks which are blocked on the specified wait queue.

       <u>whatis</u> displays the definition of structures, unions, typedefs or text/data symbols.

       <u>wr</u>     modifies the contents of memory on a live system.  It can only be used if <u>/dev/mem</u> is  the  device
              file being used to access system RAM, and should obviously be used with great care.

       When <b>crash</b> is invoked with a Xen hypervisor binary as the NAMELIST, the command set is slightly modified.
       The  <u>*,</u> <u>alias,</u> <u>ascii,</u> <u>bt,</u> <u>dis,</u> <u>eval,</u> <u>exit,</u> <u>extend,</u> <u>gdb,</u> <u>help,</u> <u>list,</u> <u>log,</u> <u>p,</u> <u>pte,</u> <u>rd,</u> <u>repeat,</u> <u>search,</u> <u>set,</u>
       <u>struct,</u> <u>sym,</u> <u>sys,</u> <u>union,</u> <u>whatis,</u> <u>wr</u> and <u>q</u> commands are the same as above.   The  following  commands  are
       specific to the Xen hypervisor:

       <u>domain</u> displays the contents of the domain structure for selected, or all, domains.

       <u>doms</u>   displays domain status for selected, or all, domains.

       <u>dumpinfo</u>
              displays Xen dump information for selected, or all, cpus.

       <u>pcpus</u>  displays physical cpu information for selected, or all, cpus.

       <u>vcpus</u>  displays vcpu status for selected, or all, vcpus.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>.crashrc</u>
              Initialization  commands.  The file can be located in the user's <b>HOME</b> directory and/or the current
              directory.  Commands found in the <u>.crashrc</u> file in the <b>HOME</b> directory are executed before those in
              the current directory's <u>.crashrc</u> file.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>EDITOR</b> Command input is read using  <b><a href="../man3/readline.3.html">readline</a>(3).</b>   If  <b>EDITOR</b>  is  set  to  <u>emacs</u>  or  <u>vi</u>  then  suitable
              keybindings are used.  If <b>EDITOR</b> is not set, then <u>vi</u> is used.  This can be overridden by <b>set</b> <b>vi</b> or
              <b>set</b> <b>emacs</b> commands located in a <u>.crashrc</u> file, or by entering <b>-e</b> <b>emacs</b> on the <b>crash</b> command line.

       <b>CRASHPAGER</b>
              If <b>CRASHPAGER</b> is set, its value is used as the name of the program to which command output will be
              sent.  If not, then command output is sent to <b><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?less">/usr/bin/less</a></b> <b>-E</b> <b>-X</b> by default.

       <b>CRASH_MODULE_PATH</b>
              Specifies an alternative directory tree to search for kernel module object files.

       <b>CRASH_EXTENSIONS</b>
              Specifies  a  directory  containing  extension modules that will be loaded automatically if the <b>-x</b>
              command line option is used.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       If <b>crash</b> does not work, look for a  newer  version:  kernel  evolution  frequently  makes  <b>crash</b>  updates
       necessary.

       The  command  <b>set</b>  <b>scroll</b> <b>off</b> will cause output to be sent directly to the terminal rather than through a
       paging program.  This is useful, for example, if you are running <b>crash</b> in a window of <b>emacs</b>.
