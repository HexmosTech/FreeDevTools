</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       iwevent - Display Wireless Events generated by drivers and setting changes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>iwevent</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>iwevent</b>  displays  Wireless Events received through the RTNetlink socket. Each line displays the specific
       Wireless Event which describes what has happened on the specified wireless interface.
       This command doesn't take any arguments.

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       There are two classes of Wireless Events.

       The first class is events related to a change of wireless  settings  on  the  interface  (typically  done
       through  <b>iwconfig</b>  or  a  script  calling  <b>iwconfig</b>).  Only settings that could result in a disruption of
       connectivity are reported. The events currently reported are changing one of the following setting :
            <u>Network</u> <u>ID</u>
            <u>ESSID</u>
            <u>Frequency</u>
            <u>Mode</u>
            <u>Encryption</u>
       All those events will be generated on all wireless interfaces by the kernel wireless subsystem (but  only
       if the driver has been converted to the new driver API).

       The  second  class  of  events are events generated by the hardware, when something happens or a task has
       been finished. Those events include :

       <b>New</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Point/Cell</b> <b>address</b>
              The interface has joined a new Access Point or Ad-Hoc Cell, or lost its association with it.  This
              is the same address that is reported by <b>iwconfig</b>.

       <b>Scan</b> <b>request</b> <b>completed</b>
              A scanning request has been completed, results of the scan are available (see <b>iwlist</b>).

       <b>Tx</b> <b>packet</b> <b>dropped</b>
              A  packet  directed  at  this  address  has  been dropped because the interface believes this node
              doesn't answer anymore (usually maximum of MAC level retry exceeded). This  is  usually  an  early
              indication  that the node may have left the cell or gone out of range, but it may be due to fading
              or excessive contention.

       <b>Custom</b> <b>driver</b> <b>event</b>
              Event specific to the driver. Please check the driver documentation.

       <b>Registered</b> <b>node</b>
              The interface has successfully registered a new wireless client/peer.  Will  be  generated  mostly
              when the interface acts as an Access Point (mode Master).

       <b>Expired</b> <b>node</b>
              The  registration  of the client/peer on this interface has expired. Will be generated mostly when
              the interface acts as an Access Point (mode Master).

       <b>Spy</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>crossed</b>
              The signal strength for one of the addresses in the spy list went under the low threshold or  went
              above the high threshold.

       Most  wireless drivers generate only a subset of those events, not all of them, the exact list depends on
       the specific hardware/driver combination. Please refer to driver documentation for details on  when  they
       are generated, and use <u><a href="../man8/iwlist.8.html">iwlist</a></u>(8) to check what the driver supports.
