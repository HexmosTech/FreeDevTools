       sg_ses_microcode - send microcode to a SCSI enclosure

       <u>DEVICE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  utility  attempts  to  download microcode to an enclosure (or one of its sub-enclosures) associated
       with the <u>DEVICE</u>. The process for doing this is defined in the SCSI Enclosure Services (SES) standards and
       drafts maintained by the T10 committee.

       The process is to send one  or  more  sequences  containing  a  SCSI  SEND  DIAGNOSTIC  command  followed
       optionally  by  a  RECEIVE  DIAGNOSTIC  RESULTS  command.  The  former sends a Download microcode Control
       diagnostic page (dpage) and the latter fetches a Download microcode status dpage which can be viewed as a
       report on the former command.

       The default action (i.e. when the <u>--mode=MO</u> option is not given)  is  to  fetch  the  Download  microcode
       status dpage and decode it. This does not require the microcode (firmware) itself so the <u>--in=FILE</u> option
       is not required.

       The  most  recent  reference  for  this  utility  is the draft SCSI Enclosure Services 3 (SES-3) document
       T10/2149-D Revision 7 at <a href="http://www.t10.org">http://www.t10.org</a> .  Existing standards for  SES  and  SES-2  are  ANSI  INCITS
       305-1998 and ANSI INCITS 448-2008 respectively.

       Most  other support for SES in this package (apart from downloading microcode) can be found in the sg_ses
       utility. Another way of downloading firmware to a SCSI device is with the WRITE BUFFER command defined in
       SPC-4, see the sg_write_buffer utility.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--bpw</b>=<u>CS</u>
              where <u>CS</u> is the chunk size in bytes and should be a multiple of  4.   This  will  be  the  maximum
              number  of  bytes sent per SEND DIAGNOSTIC command.  So if <u>CS</u> is less than the effective length of
              the microcode then multiple SEND DIAGNOSTIC commands are sent, each taking the next chunk from the
              read data and increasing the buffer offset field in the Download microcode control  dpage  by  the
              appropriate  amount.  The default is a chunk size of 0 which is interpreted as a very large number
              hence only one SEND DIAGNOSTIC command will be sent.
              The number in <u>CS</u> can optionally be followed by ",act" or ",activate".   In  this  case  after  the
              microcode has been successfully sent to the <u>DEVICE</u>, an additional Download microcode control dpage
              with its mode set to "Activate deferred microcode" [0xf] is sent.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>
              the  actual  calls  to perform SEND DIAGNOSTIC and RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS commands are skipped
              when this option is given. No SCSI commands are sent to the <u>DEVICE</u> but it is still opened  and  is
              required to be given.  A dummy device such as /dev/null (in Unix) can be used.
              This utility expects a "sensible" response to the RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command it sends (and
              will  abort  if  it doesn't receive one). So this option supplies dummy responses with one primary
              enclosure and three sub-enclosures. The dummy responses include good status values.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--ealsd</b>
              exit after last SEND DIAGNOSTIC command. A  SES  device  should  not  start  its  firmware  update
              immediately  after the last received "chunk" of its firmware.  Rather it should wait till at least
              one RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command is sent to give the device a chance to  report  any  error.
              However  some  devices  do start the firmware update immediately which causes the trailing RECEIVE
              DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command to be held up and often be aborted with a "target reset" error.
              This option causes the trailing RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command  to  be  skipped.  This  option
              would be typically used with the <u>--bpw=CS</u> option.
              Prior  to  version 1.10 of this utility [20180112] this (i.e. skipping the last RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC
              RESULTS command) was the default action.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              output the usage message then exit. If used multiple times also prints the mode  names  and  their
              acronyms.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--id</b>=<u>ID</u>
              this  option  sets  the  BUFFER  ID  field  in the Download microcode control dpage. <u>ID</u> is a value
              between 0 (default) and 255 inclusive.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--in</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              read data from file <u>FILE</u> that will be sent with the SEND DIAGNOSTIC command.  If <u>FILE</u> is '-'  then
              stdin  is  read until an EOF is detected (this is the same action as <u>--raw</u>). Data is read from the
              beginning of <u>FILE</u> except in the case when it is a regular  file  and  the  <u>--skip=SKIP</u>  option  is
              given.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--length</b>=<u>LEN</u>
              where  <u>LEN</u>  is  the  length, in bytes, of data to be written to the device.  If not given (and the
              length cannot be deduced from <u>--in=FILE</u> or <u>--raw</u>) then defaults to zero. If the  option  is  given
              and  the  length  deduced  from <u>--in=FILE</u> or <u>--raw</u> is less (or no data is provided), then bytes of
              0xff are used as fill bytes.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mode</b>=<u>MO</u>
              this option sets the MODE. <u>MO</u> is a value between 0 (which is dmc_status and the default)  and  255
              inclusive.  Alternatively  an  abbreviation can be given. See the MODES section below. To list the
              available mode abbreviations at run time give an invalid one (e.g. '--mode=xxx') or use  the  '-h'
              option.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--non</b>
              allow  for non-standard implementations that reset their Download microcode engine after a RECEIVE
              DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command with the Download microcode status dpage is sent. When this  option  is
              given sending that command and dpage combination is avoided unless an error has already occurred.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--offset</b>=<u>OFF</u>
              this  option  sets the BUFFER OFFSET field in the Download microcode control dpage. <u>OFF</u> is a value
              between 0 (default) and 2**32-1 . It is a byte offset. This option is ignored (and a warning  sent
              to stderr) if the <u>--bpw=CS</u> option is also given.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--skip</b>=<u>SKIP</u>
              this  option is only active when <u>--in=FILE</u> is given and <u>FILE</u> is a regular file, rather than stdin.
              Data is read starting  at  byte  offset  <u>SKIP</u>  to  the  end  of  file  (or  the  amount  given  by
              <u>--length=LEN</u>).  If not given the byte offset defaults to 0 (i.e. the start of the file).

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--subenc</b>=<u>SEID</u>
              <u>SEID</u> is the sub-enclosure identify. It defaults to 0 which is the primary enclosure identifier.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--tlength</b>=<u>TLEN</u>
              <u>TLEN</u>  is  the total length in bytes of the microcode to be (or being) downloaded. It defaults to 0
              which is okay in most cases. This option only comes into play when <u>TLEN</u> is greater  than  <u>LEN</u>.  In
              this  case  <u>TLEN</u>  is  sent to the SES <u>DEVICE</u> so that it knows when it only receives <u>LEN</u> bytes from
              this invocation, that it should expect more to be  sent  in  the  near  future  (e.g.  by  another
              invocation).  This  option  is  only  needed when sections of microcode are being sent in separate
              invocations of this utility (e.g. the microcode is spread across two files).

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print the version string and then exit.

</pre><h4><b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       Following is a list accepted by the <u>MO</u> argument of this utility.  First shown is an acronym  followed  in
       square brackets by the corresponding decimal and hex values that may also be given for <u>MO</u>.

       dmc_status  [0, 0x0]
              Use RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS to fetch the Download microcode status dpage and print it out.

       dmc_offs  [6, 0x6]
              Download microcode with offsets and activate.

       dmc_offs_save  [7, 0x7]
              Download microcode with offsets, save, and activate.

       dmc_offs_defer  [14, 0xe]
              Download microcode with offsets, save, and defer activate.

       activate_mc  [15, 0xf]
              Activate  deferred  microcode.  There  is  no  follow-up  RECEIVE  DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS to fetch the
              Download microcode status dpage since the <u>DEVICE</u> might be resetting.

       Apart from dmc_status, these are placed in the Download microcode mode field in  the  Download  microcode
       control  dpage. In the case of dmc_status the Download microcode status dpage is fetched with the RECEIVE
       DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command and decoded.

</pre><h4><b>WHEN</b> <b>THE</b> <b>DOWNLOAD</b> <b>FAILS</b></h4><pre>
       Firstly, if it succeeds, this utility should stay silent and return.  Typically vendors will  change  the
       "revision"  string  (which  is 4 characters long) whenever they release new firmware. That can be seen in
       the response to a SCSI INQUIRY command, for example by using the sg_inq utility.  It is possible that the
       device needs to be power cycled before the new microcode becomes  active.  Also  if  mode  dmc_offs_defer
       [0xe] is used to download the microcode, then another invocation with activate_mc may be needed.

       If something goes wrong, there will typically be messages printed out by this utility. The first thing to
       check  is  the  microcode  (firmware)  file  itself.  Is  it  designed  for the device model; has it been
       corrupted, and if downgrading (i.e. trying to reinstate older firmware), does the vendor allow that?

       Getting new firmware on a device is a delicate operation  that  is  not  always  well  defined  by  T10's
       standards  and  drafts. One might speculate that they are deliberately vague. In testing this utility one
       vendor's interpretation of the standard was somewhat surprising. The <u>--non</u> option was added to cope  with
       their interpretation. So if the above suggestions don't help, try adding the <u>--non</u> option.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This  utility  can  handle  a  maximum  size  of  128 MB of microcode which should be sufficient for most
       purposes. In a system that is memory constrained, such large allocations of memory may fail.

       The user should be aware that most operating systems have limits on the amount of data that can  be  sent
       with  one SCSI command. In Linux this depends on the pass through mechanism used (e.g. block SG_IO or the
       sg   driver)   and   various   setting   in   sysfs   in   the    Linux    lk    2.6/3    series    (e.g.
       /sys/block/sda/queue/max_sectors_kb).  Devices  (i.e.  logical  units)  also typically have limits on the
       maximum amount of data they can  handle  in  one  command.  These  two  limitations  suggest  that  modes
       containing  the word "offset" together with the <u>--bpw=CS</u> option are required as firmware files get larger
       and larger. And <u>CS</u> can be quite small, for example 4096 bytes, resulting in many SEND DIAGNOSTIC commands
       being sent.

       The exact error from the non-standard implementation was a sense key of ILLEGAL REQUEST and  an  asc/ascq
       code  of  0x26,0x0  which  is "Invalid field in parameter list". If that is seen try again with the <u>--non</u>
       option.

       Downloading incorrect microcode into a device has the ability to render that device inoperable. One would
       hope that the device vendor verifies the data before activating it.

       A long (operating system) timeout of 7200 seconds is set on each SEND DIAGNOSTIC command.

       All numbers given with options are assumed to be decimal.  Alternatively numerical values can be given in
       hexadecimal preceded by either "0x" or "0X" (or has a trailing "h" or "H").

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       If no microcode/firmware file is given then this utility  fetches  and  decodes  the  Download  microcode
       status  dpage  which could possibly show another initiator in the process of updating the microcode. Even
       if that is happening, fetching the status page should not cause any problems:

         $ sg_ses_microcode /dev/sg3
         Download microcode status diagnostic page:
           number of secondary sub-enclosures: 0
           generation code: 0x0
           sub-enclosure identifier: 0 [primary]
            download microcode status: No download microcode operation in progress [0x0]
            download microcode additional status: 0x0
            download microcode maximum size: 1048576 bytes
            download microcode expected buffer id: 0x0
            download microcode expected buffer id offset: 0

       The following sends new microcode/firmware to an enclosure. Sending a 1.5 MB file in one  command  caused
       the  enclosure  to lock up temporarily and did not update the firmware. Breaking the firmware file into 4
       KB chunks (an educated guess) was more successful:

         sg_ses_microcode -b 4k -m dmc_offs_save -I firmware.bin /dev/sg4

       The firmware update occurred in the following enclosure power cycle. With a modern enclosure the Extended
       Inquiry VPD page gives indications in which situations a firmware upgrade will take place.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_ses_microcode is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.
