</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       reset-trace - reset the state of tracing.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>reset-trace</b> <b>[-F]</b> <b>[-h]</b> <b>[-q]</b> <b>[-v]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You  will probably never need this tool. If you kill -9 a bcc tool (plus other signals, like SIGTERM), or
       if a bcc tool crashes, then kernel tracing can be left in a semi-enabled state. It's not  as  bad  as  it
       sounds: there may just be overhead for writing to ring buffers that are never read. This tool can be used
       to clean up the tracing state, and reset and disable active tracing.

       Make  sure  no  other  tracing  sessions  are active. This tool might stop them from functioning (perhaps
       ungracefully).

       This specifically clears the  state  in  at  least  the  following  files  in  /sys/kernel/debug/tracing:
       kprobe_events,  uprobe_events,  trace_pipe.  Other tracing facilities (ftrace) are checked, and if not in
       an expected state, a note is printed. All tracing files can be reset with -F for  force,  but  this  will
       interfere with any other running tracing sessions (eg, ftrace).

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/sys/kernel/debug">/sys/kernel/debug</a> mounted as debugfs

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -F     Force.  Will reset all tracing facilities, including those not used by bcc (ftrace). You shouldn't
              need to use this.

       -h     USAGE message.

       -q     Quiet. No output while working.

       -v     Verbose: print what it is doing.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Reset the state of tracing:
              # <b>reset-trace</b>

       Verbose:
              # <b>reset-trace</b> <b>-v</b>

       <b>SOURCE</b>
              This is from bcc.

       Also look in the bcc distribution for a companion _examples.txt file containing  example  usage,  output,
       and commentary for this tool.

</pre><h4><b>OS</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>STABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Unstable - in development.
