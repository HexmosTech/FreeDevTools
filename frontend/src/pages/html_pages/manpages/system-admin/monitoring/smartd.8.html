</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>smartd</b> - SMART Disk Monitoring Daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>smartd</b> <b>[options]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       [This man page is generated for the Linux version of smartmontools.  It does not contain info specific to
       other platforms.]

       <b>smartd</b>  is  a  daemon that monitors the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) system
       built into most ATA/SATA and SCSI/SAS hard drives and solid-state drives.  The purpose  of  SMART  is  to
       monitor the reliability of the hard drive and predict drive failures, and to carry out different types of
       drive  self-tests.   This  version  of  <b>smartd</b> is compatible with ACS-3, ACS-2, ATA8-ACS, ATA/ATAPI-7 and
       earlier standards (see <b>REFERENCES</b> below).

       <b>smartd</b> will attempt to enable SMART monitoring on ATA devices (equivalent to <b>smartctl</b> <b>-s</b>  <b>on</b>)  and  polls
       these  and  SCSI  devices  every  30  minutes  (configurable),  logging SMART errors and changes of SMART
       Attributes via the SYSLOG interface.  The default location for these SYSLOG notifications and warnings is
       system-dependent (typically <b>/var/log/messages</b> or <b><a href="file:/var/log/syslog">/var/log/syslog</a></b>).   To  change  this  default  location,
       please see the '-l' command-line option described below.

       In  addition  to  logging to a file, <b>smartd</b> can also be configured to send email warnings if problems are
       detected.  Depending upon the type of problem, you may want to run self-tests on the disk,  back  up  the
       disk,  replace  the disk, or use a manufacturer's utility to force reallocation of bad or unreadable disk
       sectors.  If disk problems are detected, please see the <b>smartctl</b> manual page and  the  <b>smartmontools</b>  web
       page/FAQ for further guidance.

       If you send a <b>USR1</b> signal to <b>smartd</b> it will immediately check the status of the disks, and then return to
       polling the disks every 30 minutes.  See the '-i' option below for additional details.

       <b>smartd</b>   can   be  configured  at  start-up  using  the  configuration  file  <b>/etc/smartd.conf</b>  (Windows:
       <b>EXEDIR/smartd.conf</b>).  If the configuration file is subsequently modified, <b>smartd</b> can be told  to  re-read
       the configuration file by sending it a <b>HUP</b> signal, for example with the command:
       <b>killall</b> <b>-HUP</b> <b>smartd</b>.

       On  startup, if <b>smartd</b> finds a syntax error in the configuration file, it will print an error message and
       then exit.  However if <b>smartd</b> is already running,  then  is  told  with  a  <b>HUP</b>  signal  to  re-read  the
       configuration  file,  and  then find a syntax error in this file, it will print an error message and then
       continue, ignoring the contents of the (faulty) configuration file, as if the <b>HUP</b> signal had  never  been
       received.

       When  <b>smartd</b> is running in debug mode, the <b>INT</b> signal (normally generated from a shell with CONTROL-C) is
       treated in the same way as a <b>HUP</b> signal: it makes <b>smartd</b> reload its configuration file.  To  exit  <b>smartd</b>
       use CONTROL-\.

       [Linux  only]  If <b>smartd</b> is started as a <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) service and 'Type=Notify' is specified in the service
       file, the service manager is notified after successful startup.  Other state  changes  are  reported  via
       systemd  notify STATUS messages.  Notification of successful reloads (after <b>HUP</b> signal) is not supported.
       To detect this process start-up type, <b>smartd</b> checks whether the environment variable  'NOTIFY_SOCKET'  is
       set.   Note  that  it is required to set the '-n' ('--nofork') option in the 'ExecStart=/usr/sbin/smartd'
       command line if 'Type=Notify' is used.

       On startup, in the absence of the configuration file <b>/etc/smartd.conf</b>, the <b>smartd</b> daemon first scans  for
       all devices that support SMART.  The scanning is done as follows:

       <b>LINUX:</b>   Examine  all entries <b>"/dev/hd[a-t]"</b> for IDE/ATA devices, and <b>"/dev/sd[a-z]"</b>, <b>"/dev/sd[a-z][a-z]"</b>
                for ATA/SATA or SCSI/SAS devices.  Disks behind RAID controllers are not included.

                If directive '-d nvme' or no '-d' directive is specified, examine all entries  <b>"/dev/nvme[0-99]"</b>
                for NVMe devices.

       <b>smartd</b>  then  monitors  for  <u>all</u>  possible  SMART  errors  (corresponding  to  the  '-a' Directive in the
       configuration file; see the <b><a href="../man5/smartd.conf.5.html">smartd.conf</a></b>(5) man page).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-A</b> <b>PREFIX,</b> <b>--attributelog=PREFIX</b>
              Writes  <b>smartd</b>  attribute  information  (normalized   and   raw   attribute   values)   to   files
              'PREFIX''MODEL-SERIAL.ata.csv'  or  'PREFIX''VENDOR-MODEL-SERIAL.scsi.csv'.   At  each check cycle
              attributes are logged  as  a  line  of  semicolon  separated  triplets  of  the  form  "attribute-
              ID;attribute-norm-value;attribute-raw-value;".   For  SCSI  devices error counters and temperature
              recorded in the form "counter-name;counter-value;".  Each line is led by a date string of the form
              "yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS" (in local time).

              If   this   option   is   not   specified,   attribute   information   is   written    to    files
              '/var/lib/smartmontools/attrlog.MODEL-SERIAL.ata.csv'.
              [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD 7.3 FEATURE] If '-' is specified as the argument, attribute log files are
              disabled.

              MODEL  and  SERIAL  are  build from drive identify information, invalid characters are replaced by
              underline.

              If   the   PREFIX   has   the   form   '/path/dir/'   (e.g.   '/var/lib/smartd/'),   then    files
              'MODEL-SERIAL.ata.csv'  are  created  in  directory  '/path/dir'.   If  the  PREFIX  has  the form
              '/path/name' (e.g. '/var/lib/misc/attrlog-'), then files 'nameMODEL-SERIAL.ata.csv' are created in
              directory '/path/'.  The path must be absolute, except if debug mode is enabled.

       <b>-B</b> <b>[+]FILE,</b> <b>--drivedb=[+]FILE</b>
              [ATA only] Read the drive database from FILE.  The new database replaces the built in database  by
              default.   If '+' is specified, then the new entries prepend the built in entries.  Please see the
              <b><a href="../man8/smartctl.8.html">smartctl</a></b>(8) man page for further details.

       <b>-c</b> <b>FILE,</b> <b>--configfile=FILE</b>
              Read  <b>smartd</b>  configuration  Directives  from  FILE,  instead  of  from   the   default   location
              <b>/etc/smartd.conf</b> (Windows: <b>EXEDIR/smartd.conf</b>).  If FILE does <b>not</b> exist, then <b>smartd</b> will print an
              error message and exit with nonzero status.  Thus, '-c /etc/smartd.conf' can be used to verify the
              existence of the default configuration file.

              By using '-' for FILE, the configuration is read from standard input.  This is useful for commands
              like:
              <b>echo</b> <b>/dev/sdb</b> <b>-m</b> <b>user@home</b> <b>-M</b> <b>test</b> <b>|</b> <b>smartd</b> <b>-c</b> <b>-</b> <b>-q</b> <b>onecheck</b>
              to perform quick and simple checks without a configuration file.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--capabilities[=mail]</b>
              [Linux  only]  Use  libcap-ng  to  drop  unneeded  Linux  process  <b><a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</a></b>(7).  The following
              capabilities are  kept  in  the  effective  and  permissive  sets:  CAP_SYS_ADMIN,  CAP_SYS_RAWIO,
              CAP_MKNOD.   If  the '-u, --warn_as_user' option (see below) is used with a non-privileged user or
              group, the following capabilities are also kept: CAP_SETGID, CAP_SETUID.  The capability  bounding
              set is cleared.

              [NEW  EXPERIMENTAL  SMARTD  7.3 FEATURE] Mail notification is no longer suppressed if capabilities
              are dropped.  It depends on the local MTA whether mail could be send from a root process with  all
              capabilities dropped.  It works with the <b>postfix</b> MTA.

              If  '--capabilities=mail'  is specified, the following capabilities are added to the bounding set:
              CAP_SETGID, CAP_SETUID, CAP_CHOWN, CAP_FOWNER, CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE.  This allows  one  to  send  mail
              with the <b>exim</b> MTA.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b>
              Runs  <b>smartd</b>  in "debug" mode.  In this mode, it displays status information to STDOUT rather than
              logging it to SYSLOG and does not <b><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></b>(2) into the background  and  detach  from  the  controlling
              terminal.   In  this mode, <b>smartd</b> also prints more verbose information about what it is doing than
              when operating in "daemon" mode.  In this mode, the <b>INT</b> signal (normally generated from a terminal
              with CONTROL-C) makes <b>smartd</b> reload its configuration file.  Please use CONTROL-\ to exit

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--showdirectives</b>
              Prints a list (to STDOUT) of all the possible Directives which may  appear  in  the  configuration
              file  /etc/smartd.conf,  and then exits.  These Directives are described in the <b><a href="../man5/smartd.conf.5.html">smartd.conf</a></b>(5) man
              page.  They may appear in the configuration file following the device name.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help,</b> <b>--usage</b>
              Prints usage message to STDOUT and exits.

       <b>-i</b> <b>N,</b> <b>--interval=N</b>
              Sets the interval between disk checks to <u>N</u> seconds, where <u>N</u> is a  decimal  integer.   The  minimum
              allowed  value  is  ten and the maximum is the largest positive integer that can be represented on
              your system (often 2^31-1).  The default is 1800 seconds.
              [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD 7.3  FEATURE]  The  interval  could  be  overridden  with  the  '-c  i=N'
              directive, see <b><a href="../man5/smartd.conf.5.html">smartd.conf</a></b>(5) man page.

              Note  that  the  superuser can make <b>smartd</b> check the status of the disks at any time by sending it
              the <b>SIGUSR1</b> signal, for example with the command:
              <b>kill</b> <b>-SIGUSR1</b> <b>&lt;pid&gt;</b>
              where <b>&lt;pid&gt;</b> is the process id number of <b>smartd</b>.  One may also use:
              <b>killall</b> <b>-USR1</b> <b>smartd</b>
              for the same purpose.

       <b>-l</b> <b>FACILITY,</b> <b>--logfacility=FACILITY</b>
              Uses syslog facility FACILITY to log the messages from <b>smartd</b>.  Here FACILITY is  one  of  <u>local0</u>,
              <u>local1</u>,  ...,  <u>local7</u>,  or  <u>daemon</u>  [default].   If  this command-line option is not used, then by
              default messages from <b>smartd</b> are logged to the facility <u>daemon</u>.

              If you would like to have <b>smartd</b> messages  logged  somewhere  other  than  the  default  location,
              include  (for  example)  '-l local3' in its start up argument list.  Tell the syslog daemon to log
              all messages from facility <b>local3</b> to (for example) '/var/log/smartd.log'.

              For more detailed information, please refer  to  the  man  pages  for  the  local  syslog  daemon,
              typically <b><a href="../man8/syslogd.8.html">syslogd</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man8/syslog-ng.8.html">syslog-ng</a></b>(8) or <b><a href="../man8/rsyslogd.8.html">rsyslogd</a></b>(8).

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--no-fork</b>
              Do  not  fork  into background; this is useful when executed from modern init methods like initng,
              minit, supervise or systemd.

       <b>-p</b> <b>NAME,</b> <b>--pidfile=NAME</b>
              Writes pidfile <u>NAME</u> containing the <b>smartd</b> Process ID number (PID).  To avoid symlink attacks  make
              sure the directory to which pidfile is written is only writable for root.  Without this option, or
              if  the  --debug  option  is given, no PID file is written on startup.  If <b>smartd</b> is killed with a
              maskable signal then the pidfile is removed.

       <b>-q</b> <b>WHEN,</b> <b>--quit=WHEN</b>
              Specifies when, if ever, <b>smartd</b> should exit.  The valid arguments are to this option are:

              <u>nodev</u> - Exit if there are no devices to monitor, or if any errors are  found  at  startup  in  the
              configuration file.  This is the default.

              <u>errors</u>  - Exit if there are no devices to monitor, or if any errors are found in the configuration
              file /etc/smartd.conf at startup or whenever it is reloaded.

              <u>nodevstartup</u> - Exit if there are no devices to monitor at startup.  But  continue  to  run  if  no
              devices are found whenever the configuration file is reloaded.

              <u>never</u>  -  Only  exit  if  a  fatal  error occurs (no remaining system memory, invalid command line
              arguments).  In this mode, even if there are no devices to monitor, or if the  configuration  file
              <b>/etc/smartd.conf</b>  has  errors,  <b>smartd</b>  will continue to run, waiting to load a configuration file
              listing valid devices.

              <u>nodev0</u> - [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD 7.3 FEATURE] Same as 'nodev', except that the exit status  is  0
              if there are no devices to monitor.

              <u>nodev0startup</u> - [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD 7.3 FEATURE] Same as 'nodevstartup', except that the exit
              status is 0 if there are no devices to monitor.

              <u>errors,nodev0</u>  -  [NEW  EXPERIMENTAL  SMARTD  7.3  FEATURE] Same as 'errors', except that the exit
              status is 0 if there are no devices to monitor.

              <u>onecheck</u> - Start <b>smartd</b> in debug mode, then register devices, then  check  device's  SMART  status
              once, and then exit with zero exit status if all of these steps worked correctly.

              This  last  option  is intended for 'distribution-writers' who want to create automated scripts to
              determine whether or not to automatically start up <b>smartd</b> after installing  smartmontools.   After
              starting  <b>smartd</b>  with  this command-line option, the distribution's install scripts should wait a
              reasonable length of time (say ten seconds).  If <b>smartd</b> has not exited with zero  status  by  that
              time,  the  script should send <b>smartd</b> a SIGTERM or SIGKILL and assume that <b>smartd</b> will not operate
              correctly on the host.  Conversely, if <b>smartd</b> exits with zero status,  then  it  is  safe  to  run
              <b>smartd</b>  in  normal  daemon  mode.   If <b>smartd</b> is unable to monitor any devices or encounters other
              problems then it will return with non-zero exit status.

              <u>showtests</u> - Start <b>smartd</b> in debug mode, then  register  devices,  then  write  a  list  of  future
              scheduled  self  tests to stdout, and then exit with zero exit status if all of these steps worked
              correctly.  Device's SMART status is not checked.

              This option is intended to test whether the '-s REGEX' directives in  smartd.conf  will  have  the
              desired effect.  The output lists the next test schedules, limited to 5 tests per type and device.
              This is followed by a summary of all tests of each device within the next 90 days.

       <b>-r</b> <b>TYPE,</b> <b>--report=TYPE</b>
              Intended  primarily  to  help <b>smartmontools</b> developers understand the behavior of <b>smartmontools</b> on
              non-conforming or poorly-conforming hardware.  This option reports details of <b>smartd</b>  transactions
              with  the  device.  The option can be used multiple times.  When used just once, it shows a record
              of the ioctl() transactions with the device.  When used  more  than  once,  the  detail  of  these
              ioctl() transactions are reported in greater detail.  The valid arguments to this option are:

              <u>ioctl</u> - report all ioctl() transactions.

              <u>ataioctl</u> - report only ioctl() transactions with ATA devices.

              <u>scsiioctl</u> - report only ioctl() transactions with SCSI devices.

              <u>nvmeioctl</u> - report only ioctl() transactions with NVMe devices.

              Any  argument  may  include  a  positive  integer  to  specify  the level of detail that should be
              reported.  The argument should be followed by a comma  then  the  integer  with  no  spaces.   For
              example, <u>ataioctl,2</u> The default level is 1, so '-r ataioctl,1' and '-r ataioctl' are equivalent.

       <b>-s</b> <b>PREFIX,</b> <b>--savestates=PREFIX</b>
              Reads/writes   <b>smartd</b>   state   information   from/to  files  'PREFIX''MODEL-SERIAL.ata.state'  or
              'PREFIX''VENDOR-MODEL-SERIAL.scsi.state'.  This preserves SMART  attributes,  drive  min  and  max
              temperatures  (-W  directive),  info about last sent warning email (-m directive), and the time of
              next check of the self-test REGEXP (-s directive) across boot cycles.

              If   this   option   is   not   specified,   state   information   is    maintained    in    files
              '/var/lib/smartmontools/smartd.MODEL-SERIAL.ata.state'       for       ATA       devices       and
              '/var/lib/smartmontools/smartd.VENDOR-MODEL-SERIAL.scsi.state' for SCSI devices.
              [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD 7.3 FEATURE] If '-'  is  specified  as  the  argument,  state  files  are
              disabled.

              MODEL  and  SERIAL  are  build from drive identify information, invalid characters are replaced by
              underline.

              If   the   PREFIX   has   the   form   '/path/dir/'   (e.g.   '/var/lib/smartd/'),   then    files
              'MODEL-SERIAL.ata.state'  are  created  in  directory  '/path/dir'.   If  the  PREFIX has the form
              '/path/name' (e.g. '/var/lib/misc/smartd-'), then files 'nameMODEL-SERIAL.ata.state'  are  created
              in directory '/path/'.  The path must be absolute, except if debug mode is enabled.

              The  state  information  files are read on smartd startup.  The files are always (re)written after
              reading the configuration file, before rereading the configuration file  (SIGHUP),  before  smartd
              shutdown,  and  after  a  check  forced  by  SIGUSR1.   After a normal check cycle, a file is only
              rewritten if an important change (which usually results in a SYSLOG output) occurred.

       <b>-w</b> <b>PATH,</b> <b>--warnexec=PATH</b>
              Run the executable PATH instead of the default script when smartd needs to send warning  messages.
              PATH   must   point   to   an   executable   binary   file  or  script.   The  default  script  is
              <b>/usr/share/smartmontools/smartd_warning.sh</b>.

       <b>-u</b> <b>USER[:GROUP],</b> <b>--warn-as-user=USER[:GROUP]</b>
              [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD 7.3 FEATURE] Run the warning script as a non-privileged user  instead  of
              root.   The  USER  and  optional  GROUP  may be specified as numeric ids or names.  If no GROUP is
              specified, the default group of USER is used instead.

              If a warning occurs, a child process is created with <b><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></b>(2).  This process closes  all  inherited
              file  descriptors,  connects  stdio  to  /dev/null,  changes  the  user and group ids, removes any
              supplementary group ids and then calls the <b><a href="../man3/popen.3.html">popen</a></b>(3) function from the standard library.

              If '0:0' is specified, user and group are not changed, but the remaining actions still apply.

              If '-' is specified, <b><a href="../man3/popen.3.html">popen</a></b>(3) is called directly.  This is the default.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version,</b> <b>--license,</b> <b>--copyright</b>
              Prints version, copyright, license, home page and SVN revision information for your copy of <b>smartd</b>
              to STDOUT and then exits.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>smartd</b>
       Runs the daemon in forked mode.  This is the normal way to run <b>smartd</b>.  Entries are logged to SYSLOG.

       <b>smartd</b> <b>-d</b> <b>-i</b> <b>30</b>
       Run in foreground (debug) mode, checking the disk status every 30 seconds.

       <b>smartd</b> <b>-q</b> <b>onecheck</b>
       Registers devices, and checks the status of the devices exactly once.  The  exit  status  (the  shell  <b>$?</b>
       variable)  will  be  zero if all went well, and nonzero if no devices were detected or some other problem
       was encountered.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The syntax of the <b><a href="../man5/smartd.conf.5.html">smartd.conf</a></b>(5) file is discussed separately.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>smartd</b> will make log entries at loglevel <b>LOG_INFO</b> if the Normalized SMART Attribute values have  changed,
       as reported using the <b>'-t',</b> <b>'-p',</b> or <b>'-u'</b> Directives.  For example:
       <b>'Device:</b> <b>/dev/sda,</b> <b>SMART</b> <b>Attribute:</b> <b>194</b> <b>Temperature_Celsius</b> <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>94</b> <b>to</b> <b>93'</b>
       Note  that  in  this message, the value given is the 'Normalized' not the 'Raw' Attribute value (the disk
       temperature in this case is about 22 Celsius).  The <b>'-R'</b> and <b>'-r'</b> Directives  modify  this  behavior,  so
       that the information is printed with the Raw values as well, for example:
       <b>'Device:</b> <b>/dev/sda,</b> <b>SMART</b> <b>Attribute:</b> <b>194</b> <b>Temperature_Celsius</b> <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>94</b> <b>[Raw</b> <b>22]</b> <b>to</b> <b>93</b> <b>[Raw</b> <b>23]'</b>
       Here  the  Raw  values  are the actual disk temperatures in Celsius.  The way in which the Raw values are
       printed, and the names under  which  the  Attributes  are  reported,  is  governed  by  the  various  <b>'-v</b>
       <b>Num,Description'</b> Directives described previously.

       Please see the <b>smartctl</b> manual page for further explanation of the differences between Normalized and Raw
       Attribute values.

       <b>smartd</b> will make log entries at loglevel <b>LOG_CRIT</b> if a SMART Attribute has failed, for example:
       <b>'Device:</b> <b>/dev/sdc,</b> <b>Failed</b> <b>SMART</b> <b>Attribute:</b> <b>5</b> <b>Reallocated_Sector_Ct'</b>
       This  loglevel  is used for reporting enabled by the <b>'-H',</b> <b>-f',</b> <b>'-l</b> <b>selftest',</b> and <b>'-l</b> <b>error'</b> Directives.
       Entries reporting failure of SMART Prefailure Attributes should not be ignored: they mean that  the  disk
       is failing.  Use the <b>smartctl</b> utility to investigate.

</pre><h4><b>LOG</b> <b>TIMESTAMP</b> <b>TIMEZONE</b></h4><pre>
       When  <b>smartd</b> makes log entries, these are time-stamped.  The time stamps are in the computer's local time
       zone, which is generally set using either the environment variable '<b>TZ</b>' or using a time-zone file such as
       <b><a href="file:/etc/localtime">/etc/localtime</a></b>.  You may wish to change the timezone while <b>smartd</b> is running (for example, if you carry a
       laptop to a new time-zone and don't reboot it).  Due to a bug in  the  <b><a href="../man3/tzset.3.html">tzset</a></b>(3)  function  of  many  unix
       standard  C  libraries,  the  time-zone stamps of <b>smartd</b> might not change.  For some systems, <b>smartd</b> will
       work around this problem <u>if</u> the time-zone is set using <b><a href="file:/etc/localtime">/etc/localtime</a></b>.   The  work-around  <u>fails</u>  if  the
       time-zone is set using the '<b>TZ</b>' variable (or a file that it points to).

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status (return value) of <b>smartd</b> can have the following values:

       <b>0:</b>     Daemon startup successful, or <b>smartd</b> was killed by a SIGTERM (or in debug mode, a SIGQUIT).

       <b>1:</b>     Commandline did not parse.

       <b>2:</b>     There was a syntax error in the config file.

       <b>3:</b>     Forking the daemon failed.

       <b>4:</b>     Couldn't create PID file.

       <b>5:</b>     Config file does not exist (only returned in conjunction with the '-c' option).

       <b>6:</b>     Config file exists, but cannot be read.

       <b>8:</b>     <b>smartd</b> ran out of memory during startup.

       <b>10:</b>    An  inconsistency  was  found in <b>smartd</b>'s internal data structures.  This should never happen.  It
              must be due to either a coding or compiler bug.  <u>Please</u>  report  such  failures  to  smartmontools
              developers, see REPORTING BUGS below.

       <b>16:</b>    A device explicitly listed in <b>/etc/smartd.conf</b> can't be monitored.

       <b>17:</b>    <b>smartd</b> didn't find any devices to monitor.
              [NEW  EXPERIMENTAL  SMARTD  7.3  FEATURE] This could be changed to <b>0</b> (success) with one of the '-q
              *nodev0*' options, see above.

       <b>254:</b>   When in daemon mode, <b>smartd</b> received a SIGINT or SIGQUIT.  (Note that in debug  mode,  SIGINT  has
              the  same  effect as SIGHUP, and makes <b>smartd</b> reload its configuration file.  SIGQUIT has the same
              effect as SIGTERM and causes <b>smartd</b> to exit with zero exit status.

       <b>132</b> <b>and</b> <b>above</b>
              <b>smartd</b> was killed by a signal that is not explicitly listed above.  The exit status  is  then  128
              plus  the  signal  number.   For  example  if <b>smartd</b> is killed by SIGKILL (signal 9) then the exit
              status is 137.

       An introductory article about smartmontools is <u>Monitoring</u> <u>Hard</u> <u>Disks</u> <u>with</u> <u>SMART</u>, by  Bruce  Allen,  Linux
       Journal, January 2004, pages 74–77.  See &lt;<b>https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6983</b>&gt;.

       If  you  would like to understand better how SMART works, and what it does, a good place to start is with
       Sections 4.8 and 6.54 of the first volume of the 'AT Attachment with  Packet  Interface-7'  (ATA/ATAPI-7)
       specification  Revision  4b.   This  documents  the SMART functionality which the <b>smartmontools</b> utilities
       provide access to.

       The functioning of SMART was originally defined by the SFF-8035i revision 2 and  the  SFF-8055i  revision
       1.4 specifications.  These are publications of the Small Form Factors (SFF) Committee.

       Links  to  these  and  other  documents  may  be  found  on  the  Links page of the <b>smartmontools</b> Wiki at
