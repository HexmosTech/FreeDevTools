</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XDP-monitor - a simple BPF-powered XDP monitoring tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       XDP-monitor  is  a  tool  that  monitors  various XDP related statistics and events using BPF tracepoints
       infrastructure, trying to be as low overhead as possible.

       Note that by default, statistics for successful XDP redirect events is disabled, as that leads to a  per-
       packet BPF tracing overhead, which while being low overhead, can lead to packet processing degradation.

       This tool relies on the BPF raw tracepoints infrastructure in the kernel.

       There  is  more information on the meaning of the output in both default (terse) and verbose output mode,
       in the <u>Output</u> <u>Format</u> <u>Description</u> section.

   <b>Running</b> <b>xdp-monitor</b>
       The syntax for running xdp-monitor is:

              xdp-monitor [options]

       The supported options are:

   <b>-i,</b> <b>--interval</b> <b>&lt;SECONDS&gt;</b>
       Set the polling interval for collecting all statistics and displaying them to the  output.  The  unit  of
       interval is in seconds.

   <b>-s,</b> <b>--stats</b>
       Enable  statistics  for successful redirection. This option comes with a per packet tracing overhead, for
       recording all successful redirections.

   <b>-e,</b> <b>--extended</b>
       Start xdp-bench in "extended" output mode. If not set, xdp-bench will start in "terse" mode.  The  output
       mode  can be switched by hitting C-$ while the program is running. See also the <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Description</b>
       section below.

   <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
       Enable verbose logging. Supply twice to enable verbose logging from  the  underlying  <u>libxdp</u>  and  <u>libbpf</u>
       libraries.

   <b>--version</b>
       Show the application version and exit.

   <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
       Display a summary of the available options

</pre><h4><b>Output</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       By  default,  redirect  success statistics are disabled, use <u>--stats</u> to enable.  The terse output mode is
       default, extended output mode can be activated using the <u>--extended</u> command line option.

       SIGQUIT (Ctrl + \) can be used to switch the mode dynamically at runtime.

       Terse mode displays at most the following fields:
              rx/s      Number of packets received per second
              redir/s   Number of packets successfully redirected per second
              err,drop/s     Aggregated count of errors per second (including dropped packets)
              xmit/s    Number of packets transmitted on the output device per second

       Verbose output mode displays at most the following fields:

                                                     pkt/s          - Packets received per second

                                     Errors encountered are expanded under redirect_err field
                                     Note that passing -s to enable it has a per packet overhead
                                                     redir/s        - Packets redirected successfully per second

                                     The recognized errors are:
                                                     EINVAL:        Invalid redirection

                                     packets to.
                                                     pkt/s          - Packets enqueued per second from other CPU to CPU N

              kthread          Displays the number of packets processed in CPUMAP kthread for each CPU
                                     Packets consumed from ptr_ring in kthread, and its xdp_stats (after calling
                                     CPUMAP bpf prog) are expanded below this. xdp_stats are expanded as a total and
                                     then per-CPU to associate it to each CPU's pinned CPUMAP kthread.
                                                     pkt/s          - Packets consumed per second from ptr_ring

              xdp_exception    Displays xdp_exception tracepoint events

                                     This can occur due to internal driver errors, unrecognized
                                     XDP actions and due to explicit user trigger by use of XDP_ABORTED

                                     This tracepoint is invoked for successful transmissions on output
                                     device but these statistics are not available for generic XDP mode,
                                     hence they will be omitted from the output when using SKB mode
                                                     xmit/s         - Number of packets that were transmitted per second

                                                     bulk-avg  - Average number of packets processed for each event
