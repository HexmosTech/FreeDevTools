</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       userlist - Userlisting of who's on your system.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>userlist</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program simply gives you a listing of who is connected to your system.  It is used primarily in the
       sorted listing of <b>cfingerd</b>, which utilitizes the same method of display for a more uniform output between
       systems.  (It also made more sense to do it this way instead of having jumbled  up  display  listings  in
       sorted finger displays.  Besides, it made more sense to do this than use finger.  :)

       This  program  functions  with  the  same  types of things in mind that <b>cfingerd</b> does.  If the user has a
       <u>.nofinger</u> file, their username will not be displayed in the userlisting.

       Example output is shown as:

        Username Real Name      Idletime TTY Remote console
        username I'm real ...   9d 23:59   0 (remote.site.com)

       where it would display the user's login name, the user's real name, their idle time given in  the  format
       "dd hh:mm", their TTY, and their remote location (or where they're telnetting from).

       If  the  username  is  over 8 characters, the program will not search for their information in the passwd
       file, since it may be too long.  Besides, it checks getpwnam, anyway.  :)

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>     Give standard CFINGERD (custom) output.

       <b>-n</b>     List only people idle less than one day.

</pre><h4><b>ADDITIONAL</b></h4><pre>
       Although userlist is not required to run as suid root, it is a good idea.  The reason is it  checks  each
       users'  directory  for  a <u>.nofinger</u> file.  If indeed that user has a <u>.nofinger</u> file in his/her directory,
       that user will not be shown in the userlisting.

       If you change the program to run as nobody.nobody, you are free to do so.  But you  will  also  show  the
       users  if  they  are  online, regardless of whether or not they have a ".nofinger" file (as long as their
       directory is NOT world-readable.)

</pre><h4><b>CONTACTING</b></h4><pre>
