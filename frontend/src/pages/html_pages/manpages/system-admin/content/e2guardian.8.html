</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       e2guardian2 - web content filter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>e2guardian</b> [ -<b>c</b> <u>config-file</u> ] [ -<b>v</b> ] [ -<b>h</b> ] [ -<b>N</b> ] [ -<b>q</b> ] [ -<b>Q</b> ] [ -<b>s</b> ] [ -<b>r</b> ] [ -<b>g</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>SUMMARY</b></h4><pre>
       e2guardian is a web content filtering <a href="../man1/proxy.1.html">proxy</a>(1) for Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris that uses
       <a href="../man2/Squid.2.html">Squid</a>(2) to do all the fetching.

       It  filters  using  multiple  methods.  These  methods  include  URL and domain filtering, content phrase
       filtering, PICS filtering, MIME type filtering, file extension filtering, POST limiting and content  (AV)
       scanning.

       The  content  phrase filtering will check for pages that contain profanities and phrases often associated
       with pornography and other undesirable content.  The POST filtering allows you  to  block  or  limit  web
       uploads.   The  URL  and  domain  filtering is able to handle huge lists and is significantly faster than
       squidGuard.

       Content scanning enables downloaded content to be passed through ClamD,  KAVD,  any  local  program  with
       machine-parseable console output, and any other AV scanner available as an ICAP server.

       The  filtering  has configurable domain, user and source IP exception lists.  SSL tunneling is supported;
       however, due to the encrypted nature of HTTPS requests, filtering is only supported on destination domain
       or with SSL MITM configuration.  The configurable logging produces a log in an easy to read format  which
       has  the  option to only log the text-based pages, thus significantly reducing redundant information such
       as every image on a page.

       e2guardian is under continuous development and so it is best  to  visit  the  web  site  for  the  latest
       information.

        (1)  Technically  e2guardian  is more of a filtering pass-through than a true proxy - but don't let that
       worry you!

        (2) e2guardian should work with any proxy, not just Squid. For example, it is known to work with Oops.

       Information    about    Debian    specific    changes    and    configuration    can    be    found    in
       /usr/share/doc/e2guardian/changelog.Debian.gz .

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -c <u>config-file</u>
              Use the given <u>config-file</u>.

       -v     gives the version number and build options.

       -h     Output a short summary of available command line options.

       -N     Do not go into the background.

       -q     causes e2guardian to kill any running copy.

       -Q     kill any running copy AND start a new one with current options.

       -s     shows the parent process PID and exits.

       -r     closes  all  connections  and  reloads  config files by issuing a HUP, but this does not reset the
              maxchildren option (amongst others).

       -g     gently restarts by not closing all current connections; only reloads filter  group  config  files.
