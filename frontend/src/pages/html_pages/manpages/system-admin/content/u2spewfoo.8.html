</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       u2spewfoo -  tool for dumping the contents of unified2 files to stdout

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>u2boat</b> &lt;infile&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  documents briefly the <b>u2spewfoo</b> command.  This manual page was written for the Debian
       distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       <b>u2spewfoo</b> is a lightweight tool for dumping the contents of Snort's Unified2  log  files  to  stdout.  In
       order to use it Snort first has to be configured to use this format in its configuration file.

       The  tool  will  take  the  log  file  and  dump  the  information on the events in Standard output. This
       information includes the event and relevant information about it (such as IP  addresses  and  ports,  the
       time  the  event  was  detected,  etc.) as well as the packet that triggered the event (if Snort has been
       configured to store a packet capture associated with events).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To use it run it against a unified2 log file by running: <b>u2spewfoo</b> <b>snort.log</b>

       The following is a sample output of this tool:
