       rip98d - Send and receive RIP98 routing messages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rip98d</b> <b>[-d]</b> <b>[-l]</b> <b>[-r]</b> <b>[-t</b> <b>interval]</b> <b>[-v]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  RIP98  routing  protocol was devised by John Wiseman G8BPQ as an alternative to both traditional RIP
       and RSPF for use in an RF environment.  Its main advantage is that each routing element  only  takes  six
       bytes and is therefore much more efficient in terms of bandwidth than other routing protocols.

       In  operation  <b>rip98d</b>  that  each neighbour that also uses RIP98 must be listed. RIP98 is not a broadcast
       protocol and each neighbour is individually contacted. Any  incoming  RIP98  message  is  also  validated
       against  this  list. The list of neighbours is held in /etc/ax25/rip98d.conf, and each line is either the
       name or the dotted decimal IP address of the neighbour.

       The time interval between RIP98 transmissions is set to one hour by default but other  intervals  can  be
       set  with the -t option. The routes advertised and received can be restricted by the -r option which only
       allows processing of ampr.org addresses. At present <b>rip98d</b> is under development and any feedback  on  its
       operation would be welcome.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b>              Set debugging on. Information is only output if the logging option is also enabled.

       <b>-l</b>              Enable logging to the system log, the default is off.

       <b>-r</b>              Restricts the transmitting and receiving of routes to ampr.org (44.x.x.x) addresses only.

       <b>-t</b> <b>interval</b>     The time interval between routing broadcasts, in minutes. The default is 60 minutes.

       <b>-v</b>              Display the version.
