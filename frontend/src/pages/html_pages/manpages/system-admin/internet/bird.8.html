</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bird</b> is an Internet Routing Daemon. That is, it sends and receives messages using different protocols in
       order to discover and exchange routing information with other routing daemons present on the same
       network. It is able to talk the most widely known routing protocols (such as BGPv4, RIPv2, OSPFv2 and
       OSPFv3), both on IPv4 and IPv6 and it features a very powerful language for route filtering.

       <b>birdc</b> is a remote control for <b>bird</b>. While <b>bird</b> is running, the system administrator can connect to it
       using <b>birdc</b>, to inspect its internal status and reconfigure it. The two processes use a Unix socket to
       communicate. Once started, <b>bird</b> will give access to an interactive shell: commands can be completed with
       TAB and help can be requested by pressing the key `?'. More documentation on the available commands can
       be found on the website, see below.

       <b>birdcl</b> is a light version of <b>birdc</b> remote control for <b>bird</b> without readline/ncurses support. TAB
       completion isn't available.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>bird</b> accepts these options:

       <b>-c</b> <u>config-file</u>
           Use given configuration file instead of the default /etc/bird/bird.conf.

       <b>-d</b>
           Enable debug messages to stderr, and run bird in foreground.

       <b>-D</b> <u>debug-file</u>
           Enable debug messages to given file.

       <b>-f</b>
           Run bird in foreground.

       <b>-g</b> <u>group</u>
           Run bird with given group ID.

       <b>--help</b>
           Display command-line options to bird.

       <b>-l</b>
           Look for a configuration file and a communication socket in the current working directory instead of
           in default system locations. However, paths specified by options <b>-c</b>, <b>-s</b> have higher priority.

       <b>-p</b>
           Just parse the config file and exit. Return value is zero if the config file is valid, nonzero if
           there are some errors.

       <b>-P</b> <u>pid-file</u>
           Create a PID file with given filename.

       <b>-R</b>
           Apply graceful restart recovery after start.

       <b>-s</b> <u>control-socket</u>
           Use given filename for a socket for communications with the client (remote control), default is
           /run/bird/bird.ctl.

       <b>-u</b> <u>user</u>
           Drop privileges and run as given user instead of root. The bird would keep CAP_NET_ADMIN and other
           network-related capabilities necessary for its function.

       <b>--version</b>
           Display bird version.

       <b>birdc</b> and <b>birdcl</b> accept these options:

       <b>-l</b>
           Look for a communication socket in the current working directory.

       <b>-r</b>
           Run <b>birdc</b> in restricted mode: only the `show ...' commands are allowed.

       <b>-s</b> <u>control-socket</u>
           Use given filename for a socket for communications with the server, default is /run/bird/bird.ctl.

       <b>-v</b>
           Numeric return codes are dumped along with messages, making them easily parsable by a program. See
           the programmer's documentation for information about their meanings.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/bird/bird.conf
           The system-wide configuration file to control the behaviour of bird. See the website for more
           documentation.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       More documentation can be found on the website: https://bird.network.cz/.
