</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTON</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rltraceroute6</b> is an IPv6 traceroute implementation.

       It  displays the list of hops along the network route between the local system and specified destination,
       by sending packets while incrementing their hop limit, until the final destination is reached.

       By default, <b>rltraceroute6</b> sends UDP probe packets toward the destination (that's the historical default).
       However, it can also send TCP packets, much like Michael C. Toren's <b>tcptraceroute</b> does on IPv4  networks;
       <b>tcptraceroute6</b>  sends TCP packets by default (and mimics tcptraceroute command line syntax).  Finally, it
       can also send ICMPv6 Echo Request packets, like some other traceroute implementations (such as the one in
       Microsoft Windows); <b>tracert6</b> does this by default.

       You must specify the name or address of the host toward which the network route should be determined.  An
       optional  additional  parameter  specifies either the probe packets length (for UDP and ICMP packets), or
       the destination port number/service name (for TCP packets).

       Note that TCP destination port zero really is TCP port numbered 0 (which cannot be used via the  standard
       higer-level TCP/IP programming interface).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-A</b>     Send  TCP/ACK  probe packets. That's very efficient against stateless firewalls (e.g. the official
              Linux kernel versions up to and  including  2.4.31  and  2.6.14),  and  utterly  helpless  against
              stateful ones. Note that TCP/ACK probing cannot determine whether the destination TCP port is open
              or not.

       <b>-d</b>     Enable  socket  debugging option (SO_DEBUG). Unless you are debugging the kernel, this is probably
              not going to have any actual effect.

       <b>-E</b>     Send <u>ECN-setup</u> TCP/SYN probe packets (as per RFC 3168) rather  than  non-ECN-setup  TCP/SYN  probe
              packets. This has no effect unless command line optin -S is specified as well.

       <b>-F</b>     This option is ignored for backward compatibility.  IPv6 packets are never fragmented en route.

       <b>-f</b>     Override the initial IPv6 packets hop limit (default: 1).

       <b>-g</b>     Add  an  IPv6  route  segment  within  an IPv6 Routing Header.  This enables loose source routing.
              Currently, only "Type 0" routing header is supported.

       <b>-h</b>     Display some help and exit.

       <b>-I</b>  <b>(rltraceroute6</b> <b>only)</b>
              Send ICMPv6 Echo requests (like ping6) as probe packets.  That's the default for tracert6.

       <b>-i</b>     Only send packets through the specified interface.  See also BUGS.

       <b>-I</b>  <b>(rltraceroute6</b> <b>only)</b>
              Send UDP-Lite (protocol 136) packets (with full checksum coverage) as  probe  packets  instead  of
              normal UDP (protocol 17).

       <b>-l</b> (rltraceroute6 only)
              Print the hop limit of received packets.  This is mostly used to detect asymmetric routing.

       <b>-l</b> (tcptraceroute6 only)
              Specify the size (bytes) of sent packets.

       <b>-m</b>     Override  the  maximum hop limit (maximum number of hops).  The default is 30 hops which should be
              sufficient on the IPv6 Internet for some time.

       <b>-N</b>     Try to resolve each hop's IPv6 address to a host name. This is the default.  This option is  meant
              for backward compatibility with <a href="../man8/tcptraceroute.8.html">tcptraceroute</a>(8).

       <b>-n</b>     Do  not  try  to resolve each hop's IPv6 address to a host name.  That may speed up the traceroute
              significantly.

       <b>-p</b>     For rltraceroute6, specify the base  destination  port  number  (default:  33434).   rltraceroute6
              assumes that packets toward this port up to this port plus the maximum hop limit are not in use by
              any program on the final destination and that they are not blocked by some firewall. The fact that
              this  very  assumption  was not always correct, eventually lead to the development of the original
              IPv4 tcptraceroute by Michael Toren.

              For tcptraceroute6, specify the source port number (default: auto).  Note that source port  number
              zero  really means number zero, rather than some port number that would be automatically assigned,
              as is the case with usual softwares.

       <b>-q</b>     Override the number of probes sent to each hop (default: 3).

       <b>-r</b>     Do not route packets, i.e. do not send packets through a gateway that would be  specified  by  the
              routing table.  See also BUGS.

       <b>-S</b>     Use TCP/SYN probe packets. That's the default for tcptraceroute6.

       <b>-s</b>     Specify the source address to use for probe packets explicitly.

       <b>-S</b>     Use UDP probe packets. That's the default for rltraceroute6.

       <b>-t</b>     Specify the traffic class (DSCP) for probe packets.  See also BUGS.

       <b>-U</b>  <b>(rltraceroute6</b> <b>only)</b>
              Send UDP probe packets. That's the default.

       <b>-V</b>     Display program version and license and exit.

       <b>-w</b>     Override  the delay (in seconds) to wait for response once a given probe packet was sent (default:
              5 seconds).

       <b>-x</b>     This option is ignored for seamless migration from  IPv4  traceroute.   The  IPv6  header  has  no
              checksum field.

       <b>-z</b>     Specify  a  milliseconds  delay  to wait between each probe with identical hop limit.  This can be
              useful to work-around ICMPv6 rate limitation on some hosts.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       If a response is received, the round-trip time is printed.  In addition, specific symbols denote  certain
       errors:

       <b>*</b>   No response
              No valid response received before the timeout delay (see -w option).

       <b>!N</b>  No route to destination
              There is no entry for the destination network in the routing table.

       <b>!A</b>  Communication with destination administratively prohibited
              A firewall explicitly rejected the traffic.

       <b>!S</b>  Beyond scope of source address
              The address scope of the source address is too small to reach the destination address. At the time
              of  writing,  this  can only happen when using a link-local source address to reach a global scope
              destination.  (Note: some IPv4 traceroute implementations use !S for source route error  which  is
              completely different)

       <b>!H</b>  Address unreachable
              The  host address is not reachable for some other reasons, particularly a link-layer failure (e.g.
              Neighbor discovery failure).

       <b>!P</b>  Unrecognized Next Header type encountered
              The destination does not implement the layer-4 protocol used.  You should retry with  ICMPv6  Echo
              Requests (-I command line option) which MUST be supported by any IPv6 node.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       rltraceroute6  should  be  <u>setuid</u>  <u>root</u>  to  allow  use  by  non  privileged users. It will drop its root
       privileges before any attempt is made to send or receive data from  the  network  so  as  to  reduce  the
       possible impact of a security vulnerability.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       However  useful  they might be, -i and -r options are ignored by the official Linux kernel at the time of
       writing this manpage, and hence do not work as documented.

       Support for option -t was broken until Linux kernel version 2.6.18.

       Usage of Routing Header, with option -g, triggers an OOPS on Linux kernel versions below 2.6.17.12.

       Receiving TCP/SYN-ACK packets does not work on FreeBSD at all.  This severely limits  the  usefulness  of
       tcptraceroute6 on FreeBSD.

       Packet  length  takes  the  IPv6  header  and, if present, extension headers into account.  rltraceroute6
       versions before 0.7.4 used it as IPv6 payload length instead, i.e. did not include the layer-3 headers in
       the computation.  Linux iputils traceroute6 does not even include the UDP  header.   On  the  whole,  the
       packet length semantic is very inconsistent among IPv6 traceroute implementations.
