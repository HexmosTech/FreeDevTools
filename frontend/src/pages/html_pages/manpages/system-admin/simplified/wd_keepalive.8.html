</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wd_keepalive - a simplified software watchdog daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wd_keepalive</b> [<b>-c</b> <u>filename</u>|<b>--config-file</b> <u>filename</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  a simplified version of the <b>watchdog</b> daemon. Unlike the full watchdog, this daemon run no tests
       and only serves to keep the hardware timer refreshed. Typically  this  is  used  on  system  start-up  to
       provide  protection  before  the  services  that  the  full version tests are running, and on shutdown to
       continue the refresh while those services are stopped.

       If configured so it only opens <u>/dev/watchdog</u>, and keeps writing to it often enough  to  keep  the  kernel
       from  resetting,  at  least  once  per  minute. Each write delays the reboot time another minute. After a
       minute of inactivity the watchdog hardware will cause a reset. In the case of the software  watchdog  the
       ability to reboot will depend on the state of the machines and interrupts.

       The  wd_keepalive  daemon  can  be stopped without causing a reboot if the device <u>/dev/watchdog</u> is closed
       correctly, unless your kernel is compiled with the <u>CONFIG_WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT</u> option enabled.

       Under high system load <b>wd_keepalive</b> might be swapped out of memory and may fail to make  it  back  in  in
       time.  Under  these  circumstances  the  Linux  kernel will reset the machine. To make sure you won't get
       unnecessary reboots make sure you have the variable  <u>realtime</u>  set  to  <u>yes</u>  in  the  configuration  file
       <u>watchdog.conf</u>.   This  adds  real time support to <b>wd_keepalive</b>: it will lock itself into memory and there
       should  be no problem even under the highest of loads.

       On system running out of memory the kernel will try  to  free  enough  memory  by  killing  process.  The
       <b>wd_keepalive</b> daemon itself is exempted from this so-called out-of-memory killer.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Available command line options are the following:

       <b>-c</b> <u>config-file</u>, <b>--config-file</b> <u>config-file</u>
              Use <u>config-file</u> as the configuration file instead of the default <u>/etc/watchdog.conf</u>.

       <b>-X</b> <u>num</u>, <b>--loop-exit</b> <u>num</u>
              Run  for  'num'  loops  then exit as if SIG_TERM was received. Intended for test/debug (e.g. using
              <b>valgrind</b> for checking memory access). If the daemon exits on a  loop  counter  and  you  have  the
              <u>CONFIG_WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT</u>  option compiled for the kernel or device-driver then an unplanned reboot
              will follow - be warned!

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/dev/watchdog</u>
              The watchdog device.

       <u>/var/run/wd_keepalive.pid</u>
              The pid file of the running <b>wd_keepalive</b>.
