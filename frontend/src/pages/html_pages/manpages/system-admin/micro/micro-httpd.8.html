</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       micro-httpd - really small HTTP server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         micro-httpd DIRECTORY

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       micro-httpd is a very small HTTP server all in 150 lines of code. It runs from inetd, which means its
       performance is poor. But for low-traffic sites, it is quite adequate. It implements all the basic
       features of an HTTP server, including:

           *  Security against ".." filename snooping.
           *  The common MIME types.
           *  Trailing-slash redirection.
           *  index.html
           *  Directory listings.

       To install it, add a line like this to /etc/inetd.conf:

           micro-http  stream tcp nowait nobody \
              /usr/sbin/micro-httpd micro-httpd dir

       Make sure the path to the executable is correct, and change "dir" to be the directory you want to serve.
       You could add line like this to <a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a>:

           micro-http   port/tcp   #Micro HTTP server

       Change "port" to the port number you want to use: 80, 8000, whatever.  Restart inetd by sending it a
       "HUP" signal.

       On some systems, inetd has a maximum spawn rate - if you try to run inetd services faster than a certain
       number of times per minute, it assumed there is either a bug of an attack going on and it shuts down for
       a few minutes. If you run into this problem - look for syslog messages about too-rapid looping - you will
       need to find out how to increase the limit. Unfortunately this varies from OS to OS. On FreeBSD, you add
       a "-R 10000" flag to inetd's initial command line. On some Linux systems, you can set the limit on a per-
       service basis in inetd.conf, by changing "nowait" to "nowait.10000".

       Note that you can use micro-httpd to serve HTTPS, if you like, by running it from stunnel. First fetch
       and install stunnel - FreeBSD users can just go to /usr/ports/security/stunnel and do a "make cert ; make
       install". Then as root run:

           stunnel -p /usr/local/certs/stunnel.pem -d 443 -l \
              /usr/sbin/micro-httpd --  micro-httpd dir

       Make sure the paths to the certificate and executable are correct, and again don not forget to change
       "dir" to the directory you want to serve.
