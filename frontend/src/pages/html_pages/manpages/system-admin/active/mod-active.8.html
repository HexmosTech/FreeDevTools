       mod-active - Batch processing of newsgroups creation and removal commands

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mod-active</b> [<u>ctlinnd-command-file</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mod-active</b> is a Perl script that updates the <u>active</u> file based on its input lines of <b>ctlinnd</b> "newgroup",
       "rmgroup" and "changegroup" commands.  It pauses the server briefly while the existing <u>active</u> file is
       read and rewritten, which not only keeps <b>innd</b> from updating the <u>active</u> file but also locks against other
       instances of <b>mod-active</b>.

       The script must be run as the news user.

       The input to <b>mod-active</b> can come either from one or more <u>ctlinnd-command-file</u> files named on the command
       line, or from the standard input.  Typically its input is the output from the <b>docheckgroups</b> or <b>actsync</b>
       commands.  Every line which contains the string "ctlinnd newgroup", "ctlinnd rmgroup", or "ctlinnd
       changegroup", optionally preceded by whitespace and/or the path to <b>ctlinnd</b>, is noted for the update.
       Redundant commands, such as a newgroup directive for a group that already exists, are silently ignored.
       All other lines in the input are also silently ignored.  After the new <u>active</u> file has been generated,
       the existing one is renamed to <u>active.old</u> and the new one is moved into place.  The script then displays
       the differences between the two files.  Any groups that were added to the <u>active</u> file are also added to
       the <u>active.times</u> file with the string "checkgroups-update".

       Please note that no syntax checking is performed on group names by <b>mod-active</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Though <b>innd</b> is paused while <b>mod-active</b> works, it is not inconceivable that there could be a conflict if
       something else tries to update the <u>active</u> file during the relatively short time that <b>mod-active</b> is
       working.  The two most realistic ways for this to happen are either by an administrator concurrently
       doing a manual <b>ctlinnd</b> command, or by <b>innd</b> receiving a control message, then <b>mod-active</b> pausing the
       server, then the control message handler script that <b>innd</b> forked running its own <b>ctlinnd</b> command while
       <b>mod-active</b> is working.  Note that such scenarios are <u>very</u> unlikely to happen.
