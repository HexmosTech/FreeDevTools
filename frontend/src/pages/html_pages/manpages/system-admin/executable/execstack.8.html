</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       execstack - tool to set, clear, or query executable stack flag of ELF binaries and shared libraries

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       execstack [OPTION...] [FILES]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>execstack</b>  is  a  program which sets, clears, or queries executable stack flag of ELF binaries and shared
       libraries.  Linux has in the past allowed execution of instructions on the stack and there  are  lots  of
       binaries  and shared libraries assuming this behaviour.  Furthermore, GCC trampoline code for e.g. nested
       functions requires executable stack on  many  architectures.   To  avoid  breaking  binaries  and  shared
       libraries  which  need executable stack, ELF binaries and shared libraries now can be marked as requiring
       executable stack or not requiring it.  This marking is done through the p_flags field in the PT_GNU_STACK
       program header entry.  If the marking is missing, kernel or dynamic linker need to assume it  might  need
       executable stack.  The marking is done automatically by recent GCC versions (objects using trampolines on
       the  stack  are  marked  as  requiring  executable stack, all other newly built objects are marked as not
       requiring it) and linker collects these markings into marking of the whole binary or shared library.  The
       user can override this at assembly time (through <b>--execstack</b> or <b>--noexecstack</b> assembler options), at link
       time (through <b>-z</b> <b>execstack</b> or <b>-z</b> <b>noexecstack</b> linker options) and using the  <b>execstack</b>  tool  also  on  an
       already linker binary or shared library.  This tool is especially useful for third party shared libraries
       where it is known that they don't need executable stack or testing proves it.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-s</b> <b>--set-execstack</b>
              Mark binary or shared library as requiring executable stack.

       <b>-c</b> <b>--clear-execstack</b>
              Mark binary or shared library as not requiring executable stack.

       <b>-q</b> <b>--query</b>
              Query executable stack marking of binaries and shared libraries.  For each file it prints either <b>-</b>
              when  executable  stack  is  not  required,  <b>X</b>  when executable stack is required or <b>?</b>  when it is
              unknown whether the object requires or doesn't require executable stack (the marking is missing).

       <b>-V</b>     Print <b>execstack</b> version and exit.

       <b>-?</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print help message.

       <b>--usage</b>
              Print a short usage message.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Command line arguments should be names of ELF binaries and shared libraries which should be  modified  or
       queried.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
              # execstack -s <a href="file:~/lib/libfoo.so.1">~/lib/libfoo.so.1</a>
       will mark <a href="file:~/lib/libfoo.so.1">~/lib/libfoo.so.1</a> as requiring executable stack.
              # execstack -c <a href="file:~/bin/bar">~/bin/bar</a>
       will mark <a href="file:~/bin/bar">~/bin/bar</a> as not requiring executable stack.
              # execstack -q <a href="file:~/lib/libfoo.so.1">~/lib/libfoo.so.1</a> <a href="file:~/bin/bar">~/bin/bar</a>
       will query executable stack marking of the given files.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>execstack</b>  doesn't  support  yet  marking  of executables if they do not have PT_GNU_STACK program header
       entry nor they have room for program segment header table growth.
