</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XDP-bench - a simple XDP benchmarking tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       XDP-bench  is  a benchmarking utility for exercising the different operation modes of XDP. It is intended
       to be a simple program demonstrating the various operating modes; these include dropping packets, hairpin
       forwarding (using the <u>XDP_TX</u> return code), and redirection using the various in-kernel packet redirection
       facilities.

       The drop and TX modes support various options to control whether packet data is touched (read or written)
       before being dropped or transmitted.  The  redirection  modes  support  using  the  simple  ifindex-based
       <u>bpf_redirect</u>  helper,  the <u>bpf_redirect_map</u> helper using a cpumap as its target, <u>bpf_redirect_map</u> using a
       devmap as its target, and the devmap's broadcast mode which allows redirecting to multiple devices.

       There is more information on the meaning of the output in both default (terse) and extended output  mode,
       in the <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Description</b> section below.

   <b>Running</b> <b>xdp-bench</b>
       The syntax for running xdp-bench is:

              Usage: xdp-bench COMMAND [options]

              COMMAND can be one of:
                     drop           - Drop all packets on an interface
                     pass           - Pass all packets to the network stack
                     tx             - Transmit packets back out on an interface (hairpin forwarding)
                     redirect       - XDP redirect using the bpf_redirect() helper
                     redirect-cpu   - XDP CPU redirect using BPF_MAP_TYPE_CPUMAP
                     redirect-map   - XDP redirect using BPF_MAP_TYPE_DEVMAP
                     redirect-multi - XDP multi-redirect using BPF_MAP_TYPE_DEVMAP and the BPF_F_BROADCAST flag

       Each command, and its options are explained below. Or use <u>xdp-bench</u> <u>COMMAND</u> <u>--help</u> to see the options for
       each command.

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>DROP</b> <b>command</b></h4><pre>
       In  this mode, <u>xdp-bench</u> installs an XDP program on an interface that simply drops all packets. There are
       options to control what to do with the packet before dropping it (touch the packet data or not), as  well
       as  which statistics to gather. This is a basic benchmark for the baseline (best-case) performance of XDP
       on an interface.

       The syntax for the <u>drop</u> command is:

       <u>xdp-bench</u> <u>drop</u> <u>[options]</u> <u>&lt;ifname&gt;</u>

       Where <u>&lt;ifname&gt;</u> is the name of the interface the XDP program should be installed on.

       The supported options are:

   <b>-p,</b> <b>--packet-operation</b> <b>&lt;ACTION&gt;</b>
       Specify which operation should be taken on the packet before  dropping  it.  The  following  actions  are
       available:

              no-touch       - Drop the packet without touching the packet data
              read-data      - Read a field in the packet header before dropping
              parse-ip       - Parse the IP header field before dropping
              swap-macs      - Swap the source and destination MAC addresses before dropping

       Whether to touch the packet before dropping it can have a significant performance impact as this requires
       bringing packet data into the CPU cache (and flushing it back out if writing).

       The default for this option is <u>no-touch</u>.

   <b>-l,</b> <b>--load-mode</b> <b>&lt;MODE&gt;</b>
       Specify  which  mechanism  xdp-bench should use to load (and store) the packet data.  The following modes
       are available:

              dpa       - Use traditional Direct Packet Access from the XDP program
              load-bytes     - Use the xdp_load_bytes() and xdp_store_bytes() helper functions

       This can be used to benchmark the various packet access modes supported by the kernel.

       The default for this option is <u>dpa</u>.

   <b>-r,</b> <b>--rxq-stats</b>
       If set, the XDP program will also gather statistics on which receive queue index each packet was received
       on. This is displayed in the extended output mode along  with  per-CPU  data  (which,  depending  on  the
       hardware configuration may or may not be equivalent).

   <b>-i,</b> <b>--interval</b> <b>&lt;SECONDS&gt;</b>
       Set  the  polling  interval  for collecting all statistics and displaying them to the output. The unit of
       interval is in seconds.

   <b>-e,</b> <b>--extended</b>
       Start xdp-bench in "extended" output mode. If not set, xdp-bench will start in "terse" mode.  The  output
       mode  can be switched by hitting C-$ while the program is running. See also the <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Description</b>
       section below.

   <b>-m,</b> <b>--mode</b>
       Selects the XDP program mode (native or skb). Note that native XDP mode is the default, and  loading  the
       redirect  program in skb manner is neither performant, nor recommended. However, this option is useful if
       the interface driver lacks native XDP support, or when simply testing the tool.

   <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
       Enable verbose logging. Supply twice to enable verbose logging from  the  underlying  <u>libxdp</u>  and  <u>libbpf</u>
       libraries.

   <b>--version</b>
       Show the application version and exit.

   <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
       Display a summary of the available options

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>PASS</b> <b>command</b></h4><pre>
       In  this  mode,  <u>xdp-bench</u> installs an XDP program on an interface that passes all packets to the network
       stack after processing them (returning <u>XDP_PASS</u>).  There are options to  control  what  to  do  with  the
       packet before passing it (touch the packet data or not), as well as which statistics to gather. This is a
       basic  benchmark  for  the  overhead of installing an XDP program on an interface while still running the
       regular network stack.

       The syntax for the <u>pass</u> command is:

       <u>xdp-bench</u> <u>pass</u> <u>[options]</u> <u>&lt;ifname&gt;</u>

       Where <u>&lt;ifname&gt;</u> is the name of the interface the XDP program should be installed on.

       The supported options are:

   <b>-p,</b> <b>--packet-operation</b> <b>&lt;ACTION&gt;</b>
       Specify which operation should be taken on the packet  before  passing  it.  The  following  actions  are
       available:

              no-touch       - Pass the packet without touching the packet data
              read-data      - Read a field in the packet header before passing
              parse-ip       - Parse the IP header field before passing
              swap-macs      - Swap the source and destination MAC addresses before passing

       The default for this option is <u>no-touch</u>.

   <b>-l,</b> <b>--load-mode</b> <b>&lt;MODE&gt;</b>
       Specify  which  mechanism  xdp-bench should use to load (and store) the packet data.  The following modes
       are available:

              dpa       - Use traditional Direct Packet Access from the XDP program
              load-bytes     - Use the xdp_load_bytes() and xdp_store_bytes() helper functions

       This can be used to benchmark the various packet access modes supported by the kernel.

       The default for this option is <u>dpa</u>.

   <b>-r,</b> <b>--rxq-stats</b>
       If set, the XDP program will also gather statistics on which receive queue index each packet was received
       on. This is displayed in the extended output mode along  with  per-CPU  data  (which,  depending  on  the
       hardware configuration may or may not be equivalent).

   <b>-i,</b> <b>--interval</b> <b>&lt;SECONDS&gt;</b>
       Set  the  polling  interval  for collecting all statistics and displaying them to the output. The unit of
       interval is in seconds.

   <b>-e,</b> <b>--extended</b>
       Start xdp-bench in "extended" output mode. If not set, xdp-bench will start in "terse" mode.  The  output
       mode  can be switched by hitting C-$ while the program is running. See also the <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Description</b>
       section below.

   <b>-m,</b> <b>--mode</b>
       Selects the XDP program mode (native or skb). Note that native XDP mode is the default, and  loading  the
       redirect  program in skb manner is neither performant, nor recommended. However, this option is useful if
       the interface driver lacks native XDP support, or when simply testing the tool.

   <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
       Enable verbose logging. Supply twice to enable verbose logging from  the  underlying  <u>libxdp</u>  and  <u>libbpf</u>
       libraries.

   <b>--version</b>
       Show the application version and exit.

   <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
       Display a summary of the available options

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>TX</b> <b>command</b></h4><pre>
       In  this  mode,  <u>xdp-bench</u>  installs  an  XDP  program  on  an interface that performs so-called "hairpin
       forwarding", which means each packet is transmitted back out the same interface (using the <u>XDP_TX</u>  return
       code)..  There are options to control what to do with the packet before transmitting it (touch the packet
       data or not), as well as which statistics to gather.

       The syntax for the <u>tx</u> command is:

       <u>xdp-bench</u> <u>tx</u> <u>[options]</u> <u>&lt;ifname&gt;</u>

       Where <u>&lt;ifname&gt;</u> is the name of the interface the XDP program should be installed on.

       The supported options are:

   <b>-p,</b> <b>--packet-operation</b> <b>&lt;ACTION&gt;</b>
       Specify which operation should be taken on the packet before transmitting it. The following  actions  are
       available:

              no-touch       - Transmit the packet without touching the packet data
              read-data      - Read a field in the packet header before transmitting
              parse-ip       - Parse the IP header field before transmitting
              swap-macs      - Swap the source and destination MAC addresses before transmitting

       To  allow  the  packet  to  be  successfully transmitted back to the sender, the MAC addresses have to be
       swapped, so that the source MAC matches the network device.  However, there is a performance overhead  in
       doing swapping, so this option allows this function to be turned off.

       The default for this option is <u>swap-macs</u>.

   <b>-l,</b> <b>--load-mode</b> <b>&lt;MODE&gt;</b>
       Specify  which  mechanism  xdp-bench should use to load (and store) the packet data.  The following modes
       are available:

              dpa       - Use traditional Direct Packet Access from the XDP program
              load-bytes     - Use the xdp_load_bytes() and xdp_store_bytes() helper functions

       This can be used to benchmark the various packet access modes supported by the kernel.

       The default for this option is <u>dpa</u>.

   <b>-r,</b> <b>--rxq-stats</b>
       If set, the XDP program will also gather statistics on which receive queue index each packet was received
       on. This is displayed in the extended output mode along  with  per-CPU  data  (which,  depending  on  the
       hardware configuration may or may not be equivalent).

   <b>-i,</b> <b>--interval</b> <b>&lt;SECONDS&gt;</b>
       Set  the  polling  interval  for collecting all statistics and displaying them to the output. The unit of
       interval is in seconds.

   <b>-e,</b> <b>--extended</b>
       Start xdp-bench in "extended" output mode. If not set, xdp-bench will start in "terse" mode.  The  output
       mode  can be switched by hitting C-$ while the program is running. See also the <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Description</b>
       section below.

   <b>-m,</b> <b>--mode</b>
       Selects the XDP program mode (native or skb). Note that native XDP mode is the default, and  loading  the
       redirect  program in skb manner is neither performant, nor recommended. However, this option is useful if
       the interface driver lacks native XDP support, or when simply testing the tool.

   <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
       Enable verbose logging. Supply twice to enable verbose logging from  the  underlying  <u>libxdp</u>  and  <u>libbpf</u>
       libraries.

   <b>--version</b>
       Show the application version and exit.

   <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
       Display a summary of the available options

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>REDIRECT</b> <b>command</b></h4><pre>
       In  this  mode,  <u>xdp-bench</u>  sets up packet redirection between the two interfaces supplied on the command
       line using the <u>bpf_redirect</u> BPF helper triggered on packet reception on the ingress interface.

       The syntax for the <u>redirect</u> command is:

       <u>xdp-bench</u> <u>redirect</u> <u>[options]</u> <u>&lt;ifname_in&gt;</u> <u>&lt;ifname_out&gt;</u>

       Where <u>&lt;ifname_in&gt;</u> is the name of the input interface from where packets will be redirect  to  the  output
       interface <u>&lt;ifname_out&gt;</u>.

       The supported options are:

   <b>-l,</b> <b>--load-mode</b> <b>&lt;MODE&gt;</b>
       Specify  which  mechanism  xdp-bench should use to load (and store) the packet data.  The following modes
       are available:

              dpa       - Use traditional Direct Packet Access from the XDP program
              load-bytes     - Use the xdp_load_bytes() and xdp_store_bytes() helper functions

       This can be used to benchmark the various packet access modes supported by the kernel.

       The default for this option is <u>dpa</u>.

   <b>-i,</b> <b>--interval</b> <b>&lt;SECONDS&gt;</b>
       Set the polling interval for collecting all statistics and displaying them to the  output.  The  unit  of
       interval is in seconds.

   <b>-s,</b> <b>--stats</b>
       Enable  statistics  for successful redirection. This option comes with a per packet tracing overhead, for
       recording all successful redirections.

   <b>-e,</b> <b>--extended</b>
       Start xdp-bench in "extended" output mode. If not set, xdp-bench will start in "terse" mode.  The  output
       mode  can be switched by hitting C-$ while the program is running. See also the <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Description</b>
       section below.

   <b>-m,</b> <b>--mode</b>
       Selects the XDP program mode (native or skb). Note that native XDP mode is the default, and  loading  the
       redirect  program in skb manner is neither performant, nor recommended. However, this option is useful if
       the interface driver lacks native XDP support, or when simply testing the tool.

   <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
       Enable verbose logging. Supply twice to enable verbose logging from  the  underlying  <u>libxdp</u>  and  <u>libbpf</u>
       libraries.

   <b>--version</b>
       Show the application version and exit.

   <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
       Display a summary of the available options

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>REDIRECT-CPU</b> <b>command</b></h4><pre>
       In  this  mode,  <u>xdp-bench</u>  sets up packet redirection using the <u>bpf_redirect_map</u> BPF helper triggered on
       packet reception on the ingress interface, using a cpumap as its target. Hence, this tool can be used  to
       redirect  packets  on  an  interface from one CPU to another. In addition to this, the tool then supports
       redirecting the packet to another output device when it is processed on the target CPU.

       The syntax for the <u>redirect-cpu</u> command is:

       <u>xdp-bench</u> <u>redirect-cpu</u> <u>[options]</u> <u>&lt;ifname&gt;</u> <u>-c</u> <u>0</u> <u>...</u> <u>-c</u> <u>N</u>

       Where <u>&lt;ifname&gt;</u> is the name of the input interface from where packets will be redirect to the  target  CPU
       list specified using <u>-c</u>.

       The supported options are:

   <b>-c,</b> <b>--cpu</b> <b>&lt;CPU&gt;</b>
       Specify a possible target CPU index. This option must be passed at least once, and can be passed multiple
       times  to  specify  a  list  of  CPUs. Which CPU is chosen for a given packet depends on the value of the
       <u>--program-mode</u> option, described below.

   <b>-p,</b> <b>--program-mode</b> <b>&lt;MODE&gt;</b>
       Specify a program that embeds a predefined policy deciding how packets are redirected to different  CPUs.
       The following options are available:

              no-touch       - Redirect without touching packet data
              touch          - Read packet data before redirecting
              round-robin    - Cycle between target CPUs in a round-robin fashion (for each packet)
              l4-proto       - Choose the target CPU based on the layer-4 protocol of packet
              l4-filter      - Like l4-proto, but drop UDP packets with destination port 9 (used by pktgen)
              l4-hash        - Use source and destination IP hashing to pick target CPU
              l4-sport       - Use modulo of source port to pick target CPU
              l4-dport       - Use modulo of destination port to pick target CPU

       The <u>no-touch</u> and <u>touch</u> modes always redirect packets to the same CPU (the first value supplied to <u>--cpu</u>).
       The  <u>round-robin</u>  and  <u>l4-hash</u> modes distribute packets between all the CPUs supplied as <u>--cpu</u> arguments,
       while <u>l4-proto</u> and <u>l4-filter</u> send TCP and unrecognised packets to CPU index 0, UDP packets to CPU index 1
       and ICMP packets to CPU index 2 (where the index refers to the order the actual CPUs  are  given  on  the
       command line).

       The default for this option is <u>l4-hash</u>.

   <b>-r</b> <b>--remote-action</b> <b>&lt;ACTION&gt;</b>
       If  this  option  is  set,  a separate program is installed into the cpumap, which will be invoked on the
       remote CPU after the packet is processed there. The action can be either <u>drop</u> or <u>pass</u> which will drop the
       packet or pass it to the regular networking stack, respectively. Or it can be <u>redirect</u>, which will  cause
       the packet to be redirected to another interface and transmitted out that interface on the remote CPU. If
       this option is set to <u>redirect</u> the target device must be specified using <u>--redirect-device</u>.

       The default for this option is <u>disabled</u>.

   <b>-r,</b> <b>--redirect-device</b> <b>&lt;IFNAME&gt;</b>
       Specify  the  device  to  redirect  the  packet to when it is received on the target CPU.  Note that this
       option can only be specified with <u>--remote-action</u> <u>redirect</u>.

   <b>-q,</b> <b>--qsize</b> <b>&lt;PACKETS&gt;</b>
       Set the queue size for the per-CPU cpumap ring buffer used for redirecting packets from multiple CPUs  to
       one CPU. The default value is 2048 packets.

   <b>-x,</b> <b>--stress-mode</b>
       Stress  the cpumap implementation by deallocating and reallocating the cpumap ring buffer on each polling
       interval.

   <b>-i,</b> <b>--interval</b> <b>&lt;SECONDS&gt;</b>
       Set the polling interval for collecting all statistics and displaying them to the  output.  The  unit  of
       interval is in seconds.

   <b>-s,</b> <b>--stats</b>
       Enable  statistics  for successful redirection. This option comes with a per packet tracing overhead, for
       recording all successful redirections.

   <b>-e,</b> <b>--extended</b>
       Start xdp-bench in "extended" output mode. If not set, xdp-bench will start in "terse" mode.  The  output
       mode  can be switched by hitting C-$ while the program is running. See also the <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Description</b>
       section below.

   <b>-m,</b> <b>--mode</b>
       Selects the XDP program mode (native or skb). Note that native XDP mode is the default, and  loading  the
       redirect  program in skb manner is neither performant, nor recommended. However, this option is useful if
       the interface driver lacks native XDP support, or when simply testing the tool.

   <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
       Enable verbose logging. Supply twice to enable verbose logging from  the  underlying  <u>libxdp</u>  and  <u>libbpf</u>
       libraries.

       devmap as its target.

       The syntax for the <u>redirect-map</u> command is:

       <u>xdp-bench</u> <u>redirect-map</u> <u>[options]</u> <u>&lt;ifname_in&gt;</u> <u>&lt;ifname_out&gt;</u>

       Where  <u>&lt;ifname_in&gt;</u>  is  the name of the input interface from where packets will be redirect to the output
       interface <u>&lt;ifname_out&gt;</u>.

       The supported options are:

   <b>-X,</b> <b>--load-egress</b>
       Load a program in the devmap entry used for redirection, so that  it  is  invoked  after  the  packet  is
       redirected to the target device, before it is transmitted out of the output interface. The remote program
       will update the packet data so its source MAC address matches the one of the destination interface.

   <b>-i,</b> <b>--interval</b> <b>&lt;SECONDS&gt;</b>

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>REDIRECT-MULTI</b> <b>command</b></h4><pre>
       In this mode, <u>xdp-bench</u> sets up one-to-many packet redirection between interfaces supplied on the command
       line, using the <u>bpf_redirect_map</u> BPF helper triggered on packet reception on the ingress interface, using
       a devmap as its target. The packet is broadcast to all output interfaces specified on the  command  line,
       using devmap's packet broadcast feature.

       The syntax for the <u>redirect-multi</u> command is:

       <u>xdp-bench</u> <u>redirect-multi</u> <u>[options]</u> <u>&lt;ifname_in&gt;</u> <u>&lt;ifname_out1&gt;</u> <u>...</u> <u>&lt;ifname_outN&gt;</u>

       Where  <u>&lt;ifname_in&gt;</u>  is the name of the input interface from where packets will be redirect to one or many
       output interface(s).

       The supported options are:

   <b>-X,</b> <b>--load-egress</b>
       Load a program in the devmap entry used for redirection, so that  it  is  invoked  after  the  packet  is
       redirected to the target device, before it is transmitted out of the output interface. The remote program
       will update the packet data so its source MAC address matches the one of the destination interface.

   <b>-i,</b> <b>--interval</b> <b>&lt;SECONDS&gt;</b>
       Set  the  polling  interval  for collecting all statistics and displaying them to the output. The unit of
       interval is in seconds.

   <b>-s,</b> <b>--stats</b>
       Enable statistics for successful redirection. This option comes with a per packet tracing  overhead,  for
       recording all successful redirections.

   <b>-e,</b> <b>--extended</b>
       Start  xdp-bench  in "extended" output mode. If not set, xdp-bench will start in "terse" mode. The output
       mode can be switched by hitting C-$ while the program is running. See also the <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b>  <b>Description</b>
       section below.

   <b>-m,</b> <b>--mode</b>
       Selects  the  XDP program mode (native or skb). Note that native XDP mode is the default, and loading the
       redirect program in skb manner is neither performant, nor recommended. However, this option is useful  if
       the interface driver lacks native XDP support, or when simply testing the tool.

   <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
       Enable  verbose  logging.  Supply  twice  to enable verbose logging from the underlying <u>libxdp</u> and <u>libbpf</u>
       libraries.

   <b>--version</b>
       Show the application version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>Output</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       By default, redirect success statistics are disabled, use <u>--stats</u> to enable.  The terse  output  mode  is
       default, extended output mode can be activated using the <u>--extended</u> command line option.

       SIGQUIT (Ctrl + \) can be used to switch the mode dynamically at runtime.

       Terse mode displays at most the following fields:
              rx/s      Number of packets received per second
              redir/s   Number of packets successfully redirected per second
              err,drop/s     Aggregated count of errors per second (including dropped packets when not using the drop command)
              xmit/s    Number of packets transmitted on the output device per second

       Extended output mode displays at most the following fields:
