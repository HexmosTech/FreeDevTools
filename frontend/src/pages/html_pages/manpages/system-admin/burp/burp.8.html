       Burp - BackUp and Restore Program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>burp</b> <b>[OPTIONS]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       BackUp and Restore Program.

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b> <b>[path]</b>
              Short   for  'config  file'.  The  argument  is  a  path  to  the  config  file.  The  default  is
              /etc/burp/burp.conf.

       <b>-F</b>     Foreground mode. The server will fork into the background and run as a daemon if you do  not  give
              this option.

       <b>-g</b>     Generate initial CA keys and certificates, and then exit.

       <b>-h</b>     Print help and then exit.

       <b>-?</b>     Print help and then exit.

       <b>-i</b>     Print an index table of symbols that humans may see burp produce, and exit.

       <b>-n</b>     No  forking  mode.  The  program  will accept a single query, deal with it, and then exit. This is
              useful for debugging. Implies '-F'.

       <b>-o</b> <b>[option=value]</b>
              Override a given option. You can use this flag several times to override  multiple  options.   You
              can even reset list options with the special syntax ':=' (example: '-o "include:=<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>"').

       <b>-Q</b>     Do not log to stdout (overrides config file 'stdout' setting).

       <b>-t</b>     Dry-run mode to test config file syntax.

       <b>-v</b>     Log to stdout (overrides config file 'stdout' setting).

       <b>-V</b>     Print version and exit.

       ADDITIONAL SERVER OPTIONS TO USE WITH '-a c'

       <b>-C</b> <b>[client]</b>
              Run as if forked via a connection from this client.

</pre><h4><b>CLIENT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b> <b>[b|t|r|R|l|L|p|v|V|delete|e|T|d|D]</b>
              Short  for  'action'.  The arguments mean backup, timed backup, restore, Restore, list, long list,
              parseable list, verify, Verify, delete, estimate, timer check, diff, or long diff, respectively.

       <b>-b</b> <b>[number|a]</b>
              Short for 'backup number'. The argument is a number, or 'a' to select all backups.

       <b>-c</b> <b>[path]</b>
              Short  for  'config  file'.  The  argument  is  a  path  to  the  config  file.  The  default   is
              /etc/burp/burp.conf, or %PROGRAMFILES%\Burp\burp.conf on Windows.

       <b>-C</b> <b>[client]</b>
              Allows  you  to  specify  an  alternative client to list or restore from. Requires that the server
              configuration of the alternative client permits your client to do this. See  the  'restore_client'
              and 'super_client' options.

       <b>-d</b> <b>[path]</b>
              Short  for  'directory'.  When  restoring,  the  argument is a path to an alternative directory to
              restore to. When listing, the argument is the directory to list.

       <b>-f</b>     Short for 'force overwrite'. Without this option set, a restore will not overwrite existing files.

       <b>-h</b>     Print help and then exit.

       <b>-?</b>     Print help and then exit.

       <b>-o</b> <b>[option=value]</b>
              Override a given option. You can use this flag several times to override  multiple  options.   You
              can even reset list options with the special syntax ':=' (example: '-o "include:=<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>"').

       <b>-i</b>     Print an index table of symbols that humans may see burp produce, and exit.

       <b>-q</b> <b>[max</b> <b>secs]</b>
              When running a timed backup, sleep for a random number of seconds (between 0 and the number given)
              before   contacting   the  server.  Alternatively,  this  can  be  specified  by  the  'randomise'
              configuration file option.

       <b>-Q</b>     Do not log to stdout (overrides config file 'stdout' setting).

       <b>-r</b> <b>[regex]</b>
              Short for 'regular expression'. The argument is a case sensitive regular expression with which  to
              match backup files. Use it for lists, restores and verifies.

       <b>-R</b> <b>[regex]</b>
              Case insensitive alternative to '-r'.

       <b>-s</b> <b>[number]</b>
              For use with restores - strip a number of leading path components.

       <b>-t</b>     Dry-run mode to test config file syntax.

       <b>-v</b>     Log to stdout (overrides config file 'stdout' setting).

       <b>-x</b>     On  restore, do not use the Windows VSS API, and strip out the VSS data. Works both on Windows and
              non-Windows.

       <b>-X</b> (Windows only)
              On restore, do not use the Windows VSS API and do not attempt to strip out the VSS data. Give this
              option when you are restoring a backup that contains no VSS data.

       <b>-a</b> <b>s</b>   Run this to connect to a running server to get a live monitor of the status  of  all  your  backup
              clients. The live monitor requires ncurses support at compile time.

       <b>-a</b> <b>S</b>   Similar to '-a s', but it prints the main status monitor summary screen to stdout. One application
              is  that  a  script can run this and email an administrator the output on a cron job. This doesn't
              require ncurses support. There are additional options that can be given with both  these  options,
              listed below.

       ADDITIONAL CLIENT OPTIONS TO USE WITH '-a s' and '-a S'

       <b>-C</b> <b>[client]</b>
              Limit the output to a single client.

       <b>-b</b> <b>[number]</b>
              Show listable files in a particular backup (requires -C).

       <b>-z</b> <b>[file]</b>
              Dump a particular log file in a backup (requires -C and -b).

       <b>-d</b> <b>[path]</b>
              Show a particular path in a backup (requires -C and -b).

       <b>-l</b> <b>[path]</b>
              Log file for status monitor - useful for debugging.

       ADDITIONAL CLIENT OPTIONS TO USE WITH '-a b'

       <b>-o</b> <b>seed_src=&lt;directory&gt;</b> <b>-o</b> <b>seed_dst=&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              Make  a  seeding  backup.  The  source  directory  is  replaced  with the destination directory on
              completion. Both paths need to be absolute. Your configured include paths need to be the  same  as
              the  source  directory, or within the source directory. There must be no other existing backups of
              the client running the seed job. A use case might be to make an initial backup  of  a  local  hard
              drive, and then to ship the hard drive to a remote location for subsequent backups.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>b</b>
              Runs a backup.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>t</b>
              Timed  backup.  The same as 'burp -a b', except that a script is run on the server before deciding
              to go ahead. The intention is that this command will be run on a repeating cron job with  a  short
              interval, and that the server will decide when it is time for a new backup.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>l</b>
              Lists the available backups and dates.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>l</b> <b>-b</b> <b>1</b>
              Lists all the files in backup number 1.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>l</b> <b>-b</b> <b>a</b>
              Lists all the files in all the backups.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>l</b> <b>-b</b> <b>c</b>
              Lists all the files in the current backup.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>l</b> <b>-b</b> <b>1</b> <b>-r</b> <b>myregex</b>
              Lists all the files in backup number 1 that match the regular expression 'myregex'.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>L</b> <b>-b</b> <b>1</b> <b>-r</b> <b>myregex</b>
              Long  lists  all the files in backup number 1 that match the regular expression 'myregex'. This is
              like doing an 'ls -l'.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>L</b> <b>-b</b> <b>1</b> <b>-d</b> <b>''</b>
              Long list the top level directory of backup 1.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>L</b> <b>-b</b> <b>1</b> <b>-d</b> <b>'/home/graham'</b>
              Long list the /home/graham directory of backup 1. These '-d' versions of the list function provide
              the ability to 'browse' backups.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-C</b> <b>altclient</b> <b>-a</b> <b>L</b>
              Long list the top level directory of backup 1 of client 'altclient'.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>r</b> <b>-d</b> <b>/tmp/restoredir</b>
              Restores all the files in the most recent backup into the directory /tmp/restoredir.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>r</b> <b>-b</b> <b>1</b> <b>-d</b> <b>/tmp/restoredir</b> <b>-r</b> <b>myregex</b>
              Restores all the files in backup number 1 into the directory /tmp/restoredir, if  they  match  the
              regular expression 'myregex'.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>r</b> <b>-b</b> <b>1</b> <b>-d</b> <b>/tmp/restoredir</b> <b>-r</b> <b>myregex</b> <b>-s</b> <b>2</b>
              Restores  all  the  files  in  backup  number 1 into the directory /tmp/restore, if they match the
              regular expression 'myregex', and strip 2 leading path components.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-C</b> <b>altclient</b> <b>-a</b> <b>r</b> <b>-b</b> <b>1</b> <b>-d</b> <b>/tmp/restoredir</b> <b>-r</b> <b>myregex</b>
              Restores  all  the  files  in  backup  number  1  of  client  'altclient'   into   the   directory
              /tmp/restoredir, if that match the regular expression 'myregex'.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>v</b>
              Verifies the most recent backup.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>v</b> <b>-b</b> <b>1</b> <b>-r</b> <b>myregex</b>
              Verifies everything in backup number 1 that matches the regular expression 'myregex'.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>delete</b> <b>-b</b> <b>1</b>
              Deletes  backup  number  1.  Note  that  burp will not delete backup directories that other backup
              directories depend upon.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>d</b> <b>-b</b> <b>1</b> <b>-b</b> <b>2</b>
              Report the differences between backups 1 and 2 (use -a D for more verbosity).

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>p</b> <b>-b</b> <b>1</b>
              Lists all the files in backup number 1, in burp-parsable list format.  You  may  append  something
              like  '&gt;/tmp/restore_list'  to send to a file, edit, then use as an input for restoring. As in the
              following command:

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>r</b> <b>-b</b> <b>1</b> <b>-o</b> <b>restore_list=/tmp/restore_list</b>
              Restores from backup 7, matching the list of files given in  /tmp/restore_list.  The  files  given
              must be ordered as they would be in the output of a burp list command.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>p</b> <b>-b</b> <b>6</b> <b>|</b> <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>R</b> <b>-b</b> <b>7</b>
              Restores  from backup 7, matching the list of files on standard input, which is provided by burp's
              list of backup 6 ('-a R' is shorthand for '-a r -o restore_list=-').

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>p</b> <b>-b</b> <b>6</b> <b>|</b> <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>V</b> <b>-b</b> <b>7</b>
              Verifies from backup 7, matching the list of files on standard input, which is provided by  burp's
              list of backup 6 ('-a V' is shorthand for '-a v -o restore_list=-').

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>s</b>
              Run the ncurses status monitor.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-a</b> <b>S</b>
              Print a status monitor snapshot, summarising all clients.

       <b>burp</b> <b>-C</b> <b>testclient</b> <b>-a</b> <b>S</b>
              Print a status monitor snapshot, showing client 'testclient' only.

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>.</b> <b>[glob]</b>
              Read additional configuration files.

       <b>mode=server</b>
              Required to run in server mode.

       <b>listen=[address]:[port]</b>
              Defines  the  main  TCP  address  and  port  that the server listens on. Specify multiple 'listen'
              entries on separate lines in order to listen on multiple addresses and ports.  Each  pair  can  be
              configured with its own 'max_children' value.

       <b>listen_status=[address]:[port]</b>
              Defines  the  main  TCP  address  and port that the server listens on for status requests. Specify
              multiple 'listen_status' entries on separate lines in order to listen on  multiple  addresses  and
              ports.  Each  pair can be configured with its own 'max_status_children' value. Comment out to have
              no status server.

       <b>network_allow=[string]</b>
              Allows access for the specified network or address. For example: '::1' or  '127.0.0.1/8'.  Specify
              multiple  'network_allow'  entries  on  separate lines to allow multiple networks or addresses. If
              this option is not given, all networks are allowed. This option can be overridden  by  the  client
              configuration files in clientconfdir on the server.

       <b>network_allow_status=[string]</b>
              Allows  access  for  the  specified network or address to the status server. For example: '::1' or
              '127.0.0.1/8'. Specify multiple 'network_allow'  entries  on  separate  lines  to  allow  multiple
              networks  or  addresses. If this option is not given, all networks are allowed. This option can be
              overridden by the client configuration files in clientconfdir on the server.

       <b>cname_lowercase=[0|1]</b>
              Whether to force lowercase cname when looking-up in clientconfdir.  This  also  affects  the  fqdn
              lookup on the client (see client configuration options for details). The default is 0. When set to
              1 the name provided by the client while authenticating will be lowercased.

       <b>cname_fqdn=[0|1]</b>
              Whether  to keep fqdn cname (like 'testclient.example.com') when looking-up in clientconfdir. This
              also affects the fqdn lookup on the client (see client configuration  options  for  details).  The
              default is 1. When set to 0, the fqdn provided by the client while authenticating will be stripped
              ('testclient.example.com' becomes 'testclient').

       <b>daemon=[0|1]</b>
              Whether to daemonise. The default is 1.

       <b>fork=[0|1]</b>
              Whether to fork children. The default is 1.

       <b>directory=[path]</b>
              Path to the directory in which to store backups.

       <b>directory_tree=[0|1]</b>
              When turned on (which is the default) and the client is on version 1.3.6 or greater, the structure
              of the storage directory will mimic that of the original filesystem on the client.

       <b>timestamp_format=[strftime</b> <b>format]</b>
              This allows you to tweak the format of the timestamps of individual backups. See 'man strftime' to
              see available substitutions. If this option is unset, burp uses "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z".

       <b>password_check=[0|1]</b>
              Allows  you  to  turn client password checking on or off. The default is on. SSL certificates will
              still be checked if you  turn  passwords  off.  This  option  can  be  overridden  by  the  client
              configuration files in clientconfdir on the server.

       <b>clientconfdir=[path]</b>
              Path to the directory that contains client configuration files.

       <b>lockfile=[path]</b>
              Path to the lockfile that ensures that two server processes cannot run simultaneously.

       <b>pidfile=[path]</b>
              Synonym for lockfile.

       <b>syslog=[0|1]</b>
              Log to syslog. Defaults to off.

       <b>stdout=[0|1]</b>
              Log to stdout. Defaults to on.

       <b>keep=[number]</b>
              Number  of  backups  to  keep.  This can be overridden by the clientconfdir configuration files in
              clientconfdir on the server. Specify multiple 'keep' entries on separate lines in  order  to  keep
              multiple  periods  of  backups.  For  example,  assuming that you are doing a backup a day, keep=7
              keep=4 keep=6 (on separate lines) will keep 7 daily backups, 4  weekly  backups  (7x4=28),  and  6
              multiples  of 4 weeks (7x4x6=168) - roughly 6 monthly backups. Effectively, you will be guaranteed
              to be able to restore up to 168 days ago, with  the  number  of  available  backups  exponentially
              decreasing  as  you  go  back  in  time  to  that point. In this example, every 7th backup will be
              hardlinked to allow burp to safely delete intermediate backups when necessary.  You  can  have  as
              many  'keep'  lines  as  you like, as long as they don't exceed 52560000 when multiplied together.
              That is, a backup every minute for 100 years.

       <b>manual_delete=[path]</b>
              This can be overridden by the clientconfdir configuration files in clientconfdir  on  the  server.
              When  the  server needs to delete old backups, or rubble left over from generating reverse patches
              with librsync=1, it will normally delete them in place. If you use the 'manual_delete' option, the
              files will be moved to the path specified for deletion at a later point. You  will  then  need  to
              configure  a cron job, or similar, to delete the files yourself. Do not specify a path that is not
              on the same filesystem as the client storage directory.

       <b>hardlinked_archive=[0|1]</b>
              On the server, defines whether to keep hardlinked files in the backups,  or  whether  to  generate
              reverse  deltas  and  delete  the  original  files.  Can  be  set  to  either  0  (off) or 1 (on).
              Disadvantage: More disk space will be used Advantage:  Restores  will  be  faster,  and  since  no
              reverse  deltas  need to be generated, the time and effort the server needs at the end of a backup
              is reduced.

       <b>max_hardlinks=[number]</b>
              On the server, the number of times that a single file can be hardlinked. The  bedup  program  also
              obeys this setting. The default is 10000.

       <b>librsync=[0|1]</b>
              When  set  to  0, delta differencing will not take place. That is, when a file changes, the server
              will request the whole new file. The default is 1. This option can be  overridden  by  the  client
              configuration files in clientconfdir on the server.

       <b>librsync_max_size=[B/KB/MB/GB]</b>
              Only  use  librsync  when  a  file  is  less than the given size. Both the most recently backed up
              version of a file and the version to be backed up are checked. The default is 0, which  means  the
              option is off. This option can be overridden by the client configuration files in clientconfdir on
              the server.

       <b>compression=zlib[0-9]</b> <b>(or</b> <b>gzip[0-9])</b>
              Choose  the  level  of  zlib  compression  for  files  stored in backups. Setting 0 or zlib0 turns
              compression off. The default is zlib9. This option can be overridden by the  client  configuration
              files in clientconfdir on the server. 'gzip' is a synonym of 'zlib'.

       <b>hard_quota=[B/KB/MB/GB]</b>
              Do  not  back up the client if the estimated size of all files is greater than the specified size.
              Example: 'hard_quota = 100GB'. Set to 0 (the default) to have no limit.

       <b>soft_quota=[B/KB/MB/GB]</b>
              A warning will be issued when the estimated size of all files is greater than the  specified  size
              and  smaller  than  hard_quota.  Example:  'soft_quota  = 95GB'. Set to 0 (the default) to have no
              warning.

       <b>version_warn=[0|1]</b>
              When this is on, which is the default, a warning will be issued when the client version  does  not
              match  the  server  version.  This  option  can be overridden by the client configuration files in
              clientconfdir on the server.

       <b>path_length_warn=[0|1]</b>
              When this is on, which is the default, a warning will be issued when the client sends a path  that
              is  too  long  to  replicate in the storage area tree structure. The file will still be saved in a
              numbered file outside of the tree structure, regardless of the setting of this option. This option
              can be overridden by the client configuration files in clientconfdir on the server.

       <b>client_lockdir=[path]</b>
              Path to the directory in which to keep per-client lock files. By default, this is set to the  path
              given by the 'directory' option.

       <b>user=[username]</b>
              Run  as  a  particular  user.  This  can  be  overridden  by  the  client  configuration  files in
              clientconfdir on the server.

       <b>group=[groupname]</b>
              Run as a  particular  group.  This  can  be  overridden  by  the  client  configuration  files  in
              clientconfdir on the server.

       <b>readall=[0|1]</b>
              Keep  readall  capability  when dropping root privileges (default 0). When enabled changes default
              atime to 1.

       <b>umask=[umask]</b>
              Set the file creation umask. Default is 0022.

       <b>ratelimit=[Mb/s]</b>
              Set the network send rate limit, in Mb/s. If this option is not given, burp will send data as fast
              as it can. If you want the server's sending speed to be limited, you will also need  to  set  this
              option on the server side.

       <b>network_timeout=[s]</b>
              Set  the  network timeout in seconds. If no data is sent or received over a period of this length,
              burp will give up. The default is 7200 seconds (2 hours).

       <b>working_dir_recovery_method=[resume|delete]</b>
              This option tells the server what to do when it finds the  working  directory  of  an  interrupted
              backup  (perhaps  somebody pulled the plug on the server, or something). This can be overridden by
              the client configurations files in clientconfdir on the server.  Options are...

       <b>delete:</b> Just delete the old working directory.

       <b>resume:</b> Continue the previous backup from the point at which it left off. NOTE: If the client has changed
       its include/exclude configuration since the backup was interrupted, the recovery method will
       automatically switch to 'delete'. See also the 'resume attempts' option.

       <b>max_resume_attempts=[number]</b>
              If working_dir_recovery_method is 'resume', this option tells the server how many times to attempt
              to resume before giving up and deleting the working directory. The default is 0,  which  means  to
              never give up.

       <b>client_can_delete=[0|1]</b>
              Turn this off to prevent clients from deleting backups with the '-a delete' option. The default is
              that clients can delete backups. Restore clients can override this setting.

       <b>client_can_diff=[0|1]</b>
              Turn  this off to prevent clients from diffing backups with the '-a d' option. The default is that
              clients can diff backups. Restore clients can override this setting.

       <b>client_can_force_backup=[0|1]</b>
              Turn this off to prevent clients from forcing backups with the '-a b' option. Timed  backups  will
              still work. The default is that clients can force backups.

       <b>client_can_list=[0|1]</b>
              Turn  this off to prevent clients from listing backups with the '-a l' option. The default is that
              clients can list backups. Restore clients can override this setting.

       <b>client_can_monitor=[0|1]</b>
              Turn this off to prevent clients from being able to run the status monitor. The  default  is  that
              clients can run the status monitor. Restore clients can override this setting.

       <b>client_can_restore=[0|1]</b>
              Turn  this  off to prevent clients from initiating restores with the '-a r' option. The default is
              that clients can initiate restores. Restore clients can override this setting.

       <b>client_can_verify=[0|1]</b>
              Turn this off to prevent clients from initiating a verify job with the '-a v' option. The  default
              is that clients can initiate a verify job. Restore clients can override this setting.

       <b>super_client=[client]</b>
              A client that is permitted to list, verify, restore, delete, and diff files belonging to any other
              client,  according  to  the super_client's client_can permissions (eg, 'client_can_list'). You may
              specify multiple super_clients. If this  is  too  permissive,  you  may  set  a  super_client  for
              individual original clients in the individual clientconfdir files, or look at the 'restore_client'
              option.

       <b>restore_client=[client]</b>
              A client that is permitted to list, verify, restore, delete, and diff files belonging to any other
              client, according to the client_can permissions on both the restore_client and the original_client
              (eg,  'client_can_list'). You may specify multiple restore_clients. If this is too permissive, you
              may set a restore_client for individual original clients in the individual clientconfdir files.

       <b>ssl_cert_ca=[path]</b>
              The path to the SSL CA certificate. This file will probably be the same on both the server and the
              client. The file should contain just the certificate in PEM format. For more information on  this,
              and the other ssl_* options, please see docs/burp_ca.txt.

       <b>ssl_cert=[path]</b>
              The  path  to the server SSL certificate. It works for me when the file contains the concatenation
              of the certificate and private key in PEM format.

       <b>ssl_key=[path]</b>
              The path to the server SSL private key in PEM format.

       <b>ssl_key_password=[password]</b>
              Only needed for loading an encrypted certificate.

       <b>ssl_cert_password=[password]</b>
              Synonym for ssl_key_password.

       <b>ssl_ciphers=[cipher</b> <b>list]</b>
              Allowed SSL ciphers. See openssl ciphers for details.

       <b>ssl_compression=zlib[0|5]</b> <b>(or</b> <b>gzip[0|5])</b>
              Choose the level of zlib compression over SSL. Setting 0  or  zlib0  turns  SSL  compression  off.
              Setting  non-zero  gives  zlib5  compression  (it is not currently possible for openssl to set any
              other level). The default is 5. 'gzip' is a synonym of 'zlib'.

       <b>ssl_verify_peer_early=[0|1]</b>
              Verify and authenticate client certificates at SSL layer before receiving or sending Burp traffic.
              The default is to verify client certificates only after password authentication.

       <b>ssl_dhfile=[path]</b>
              Path to Diffie-Hellman parameter file. To generate one with openssl,  use  a  command  like  this:
              openssl dhparam -dsaparam -out dhfile.pem 2048

       <b>max_parallel_backups=[number]</b>
              Defines  the number of max parallel backups (the number of clients that are in a "working" state).
              The default is 0 - unlimited.

       <b>max_children=[number]</b>
              Defines the number of child processes to fork (the  number  of  clients  that  can  simultaneously
              connect.  The  default is 5. Specify multiple 'max_children' entries on separate lines if you have
              configured multiple 'listen' entries.

       <b>max_status_children=[number]</b>
              Defines the number of status child processes to fork  (the  number  of  status  clients  that  can
              simultaneously  connect.  The  default  is  5.  Specify  multiple 'max_status_children' entries on
              separate lines if you have configured multiple 'listen_status' entries.

       <b>max_storage_subdirs=[number]</b>
              Defines  the  number  of  subdirectories  in  the  data  storage  areas.  The  maximum  number  of
              subdirectories that ext3 allows is 32000. If you do not set this option, it defaults to 30000.

       <b>timer_script=[path]</b>
              Path to the script to run when a client connects with the timed backup option. If the script exits
              with  code  0,  a  backup will run. The first three arguments are the client name, the path to the
              'current' storage directory, and the path to the top  level  storage  directories.  The  next  two
              arguments  are  reserved,  and  user arguments (see timer_arg) are appended after that. An example
              timer script is provided. The timer_script option can be overridden by  the  client  configuration
              files  in clientconfdir on the server. If this option is not set, equivalent code internal to Burp
              will be run instead. The internal code also uses the timer_arg parameters.

       <b>timer_arg=[string]</b>
              A user-definable argument to the timer script. You can have many of these. The  timer_arg  options
              can be overridden by the client configuration files in clientconfdir on the server.

       <b>timer_repeat_interval=[m]</b>
              During  a  timed backup, the timer script can be run at regular intervals. If the client is out of
              timeband, the backup will be interrupted. For example, setting 5 will cause burp  to  check  every
              five minutes. The default is 0, which means that the script will only run once at the start of the
              backup.

       <b>notify_success_script=[path]</b>
              Path  to the script to run when a backup succeeds. User arguments are appended after the first six
              reserved arguments. An example notify script is provided. The notify_success_script option can  be
              overriddden by the client configuration files in clientconfdir on the server.

       <b>notify_success_arg=[string]</b>
              A  user-definable  argument  to  the  notify  success  script.  You  can  have  many of these. The
              notify_success_arg options can be overriddden by the client configuration files  in  clientconfdir
              on the server.

       <b>notify_success_warnings_only=[0|1]</b>
              Set   to   1   to   send   success   notifications   when   there   were  warnings.  If  this  and
              notify_success_changes_only are not turned on, success notifications are always sent.

       <b>notify_success_changes_only=[0|1]</b>
              Set to 1 to send success notifications  when  there  were  new  or  changed  files.  If  this  and
              notify_success_warnings_only are not turned on, success notifications are always sent.

       <b>notify_failure_script=[path]</b>
              The same as notify_success_script, but for backups that failed.

       <b>notify_failure_arg=[string]</b>
              The same as notify_success_arg, but for backups that failed.

       <b>notify_failure_on_backup_with_failovers_left=[0|1]</b>
              In  the  case  where  there are server_failover entries left to try, you may not wish to notify on
              backup failure. The default is on.

       <b>notify_failure_on_backup_working_dir_deletion=[0|1]</b>
              On the next backup attempt after a backup was interrupted, it may not be possible  to  resume  the
              previous backup. In this case (or if working_dir_recovery_method is 'delete'), the previous backup
              will be deleted. You may wish to be notified about this. The default is off.

       <b>dedup_group=[string]</b>
              Enables you to group clients together for file deduplication purposes. For example, you might want
              to  set  'dedup_group=xp' for each Windows XP client, and then run the bedup program on a cron job
              every other day with the option '-g xp'.

       <b>server_script_pre=[path]</b>
              Path to a script to run on the server after each successfully authenticated connection but  before
              any  work  is carried out. The arguments to it are 'pre', '(client command)', '(client name)', '(0
              or 1 for success or  failure)',  '(timer  script  exit  code)',  and  then  arguments  defined  by
              server_script_pre_arg.  If  the script returns non-zero, the task asked for by the client will not
              be run. This command and related options can be overriddden by the client configuration  files  in
              clientconfdir on the server.

       <b>server_script_pre_arg=[string]</b>
              A user-definable argument to the server pre script. You can have many of these.

       <b>server_script_pre_notify=[0|1]</b>
              Turn  on  to  send a notification email when the server pre script returns non-zero. The output of
              the script will be included in the email. The default is off.  Most  people  will  not  want  this
              turned on because clients usually contact the server at 20 minute intervals and this could cause a
              lot of emails to be generated. Requires the notify_failure options to be set.

       <b>server_script_post=[path]</b>
              Path  to  a  script  to  run  on the server before the client disconnects. The arguments to it are
              'post', '(client command)', '(client name), '(0 or 1 for success or failure)', '(timer script exit
              code)', and then arguments defined by server_script_post_arg. This command and related options can
              be overriddden by the client configuration files in clientconfdir on the server.

       <b>server_script_post_arg=[string]</b>
              A user-definable argument to the server post script. You can have many of these.

       <b>server_script_post_notify=[0|1]</b>
              Turn on to send a notification email when the server post script returns non-zero. The  output  of
              the  script will be included in the email. The default is off. Requires the notify_failure options
              to be set.

       <b>server_script=[path]</b>
              You can use this to save space in your config file when you want to run  the  same  server  script
              twice. It overrides server_script_pre and server_script_post. This command and related options can
              be overriddden by the client configuration files in clientconfdir on the server.

       <b>server_script_arg=[path]</b>
              Goes with server_script and overrides server_script_pre_arg and server_script_post_arg.

       <b>server_script_notify=[0|1]</b>
              Turn  on  to  send  notifications  email when the server pre and post scripts return non-zero. The
              output of  the  script  will  be  included  in  the  email.  The  default  is  off.  Requires  the
              notify_failure options to be set.

       <b>server_script_post_run_on_fail=[0|1]</b>
              If  this is set to 1, server_script_post will always be run. The default is 0, which means that if
              the task asked for by the client fails, server_script_post will not be run.

       <b>autoupgrade_dir=[path]</b>
              Path to autoupgrade directory from which upgrades are downloaded. The option can be left unset  in
              order  not  to autoupgrade clients. Please see docs/autoupgrade.txt in the source package for more
              help with this option.

       <b>ca_conf=[path]</b>
              Path to certificate authority configuration file.  The  CA  configuration  file  will  usually  be
              /etc/burp/CA.cnf. The CA directory indicated by CA.cnf will usually be /etc/burp/CA. If ca_conf is
              set  and  the  CA  directory  does  not  exist, the server will create, populate it, and the paths
              indicated by ssl_cert_ca, ssl_cert, ssl_key and ssl_dhfile will be overwritten. For more  detailed
              information on this and the other ca_* options, please see docs/burp_ca.txt.

       <b>ca_name=[name]</b>
              Name of the CA that the server will generate when using the ca_conf option.

       <b>ca_server_name=[name]</b>
              The name that the server will put into its own SSL certificates when using the ca_conf option.

       <b>ca_burp_ca=[path]</b>
              Path to the burp_ca script when using the ca_conf option.

       <b>ca_crl=[path]</b>
              Override the default path to the certificate revocation list.

       <b>ca_crl_check=[0|1]</b>
              Whether to check for revoked certificates in the certificate revocation list.

       <b>monitor_browse_cache=[0|1]</b>
              Whether  or  not  the  server  should  cache the directory tree when a monitor client is browsing.
              Advantage: browsing is faster. Disadvantage: more memory is used.

       <b>label=[string]</b>
              You can have multiple labels, and they can be overridden in  the  client  configuration  files  in
              clientconfdir  on the server. They will appear as an array of strings in the server status monitor
              JSON output. The idea is to provide a mechanism for arbitrary values to be passed  to  clients  of
              the server status monitor.

       <b>enabled=[0|1]</b>
              Set  this to 0 if you want to disable all clients. The default is 1. This option can be overridden
              per-client in the client configuration files in clientconfdir on the server.

       <b>fail_on_warning=[0|1]</b>
              If a warning is generated during a backup, fail the backup. The default is 0. This option  can  be
              overridden per-client in the client configuration files in clientconfdir on the server.

</pre><h4><b>CLIENT</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>.</b> <b>[glob]</b>
              Read  additional  configuration  files.  On  Windows, the glob is unimplemented - you will need to
              specify an actual file.

       <b>mode=client</b>
              Required to run in client mode.

       <b>server=[host:port]</b>
              Defines the server to connect to. If you don't specify a port here, you will need  to  specify  it
              separately.

       <b>server_failover=[host:port]</b>
              Defines  a  failover  server to connect to. You can provide more than one 'server_failover' entry.
              The client will try the next failover server if it fails to connect. IMPORTANT:  The  burp  client
              currently  does  not  have  the capability to have a different SSL profile for each server, so for
              this to work for you, you will need to have the same CA and certificates on each server.

       <b>failover_on_backup_error=[0|1]</b>
              Failover to failover servers on backup errors as well as failures to connect. The default is off.

       <b>port=[port]</b>
              Defines the TCP port on the server that we will send requests to. If this option is set, it is the
              default for these options,  which  can  be  overridden  individually:  port_backup,  port_restore,
              port_verify,  port_list,  port_delete.  If this option is not set, you will need to set all of the
              port options separately.

       <b>port_backup=[port]</b>
              Defines the TCP port on the server that we will send backup requests to. If not set,  it  defaults
              to the port option.

       <b>port_restore=[port]</b>
              Defines  the TCP port on the server that we will send restore requests to. If not set, it defaults
              to the port option.

       <b>port_verify=[port]</b>
              Defines the TCP port on the server that we will send verify requests to. If not set,  it  defaults
              to the port_restore option.

       <b>port_list=[port]</b>
              Defines  the TCP port on the server that we will send list requests to. If not set, it defaults to
              the port option.

       <b>port_delete=[port]</b>
              Defines the TCP port on the server that we will send delete requests to. If not set,  it  defaults
              to the port option.

       <b>status_port=[port]</b>
              Defines the TCP port that the server is listening on for status requests.

       <b>cname=[client</b> <b>name]</b>
              Defines the client name to identify as to the server.

       <b>cname_lowercase=[0|1]</b>
              Whether to force lowercase cname when detecting cname automatically (ie. no cname provided above).
              The default is 0. When set to 1 the name returned by the get_fqdn function will be lowercased.

       <b>cname_fqdn=[0|1]</b>
              Whether to keep fqdn cname (like 'testclient.example.com') when detecting cname automatically (ie.
              no  cname  provided  above).  The  default  is 1. When set to 0, the fqdn returned by the get_fqdn
              function will be stripped ('testclient.example.com' becomes 'testclient').

       <b>password=[password]</b>
              Defines the password to send to the server.

       <b>enabled=[0|1]</b>
              Set this to 0 if you want to disable a client. The default is 1. This option can also  be  set  in
              the client configuration files in clientconfdir on the server.

       <b>lockfile=[path]</b>
              Path  to  the  lockfile  that  ensures  that  two client processes cannot run simultaneously (this
              currently doesn't work on Windows).

       <b>pidfile=[path]</b>
              Synonym for lockfile.

       <b>syslog=[0|1]</b>
              Log to syslog. Defaults to off.

       <b>stdout=[0|1]</b>
              Log to stdout. Defaults to on.

       <b>progress_counter=[0|1]</b>
              Print progress counters on stdout. Defaults to on.

       <b>randomise=[max</b> <b>secs]</b>
              When running a timed backup, sleep for a random number of seconds (between 0 and the number given)
              before contacting the server. Alternatively, this can  be  specified  by  the  '-q'  command  line
              option.

       <b>user=[username]</b>
              Run as a particular user (not supported on Windows).

       <b>group=[groupname]</b>
              Run as a particular group (not supported on Windows).

       <b>ratelimit=[Mb/s]</b>
              Set the network send rate limit, in Mb/s. If this option is not given, burp will send data as fast
              as  it  can.  If you want the client's sending speed to be limited, you will also need to set this
              option on the client side.

       <b>network_timeout=[s]</b>
              Set the network timeout in seconds. If no data is sent or received over a period of  this  length,
              burp will give up. The default is 7200 seconds (2 hours).

       <b>ca_burp_ca=[path]</b>
              Path  to  the  burp_ca  script  (burp_ca.bat on Windows). For more information on this, please see
              docs/burp_ca.txt.

       <b>ca_csr_dir=[path]</b>
              Directory where certificate signing requests are generated. For more information on  this,  please
              see docs/burp_ca.txt.

       <b>ssl_cert_ca=[path]</b>
              The path to the SSL CA certificate. This file will probably be the same on both the server and the
              client.  The  file should contain just the certificate in PEM format. For more information on this
              and the other ssl_* options, please see docs/burp_ca.txt.

       <b>ssl_cert=[path]</b>
              The path to the client SSL certificate. It works for me when the file contains  the  concatenation
              of the certificate and private key in PEM format.

       <b>ssl_key=[path]</b>
              The path to the client SSL private key in PEM format.

       <b>ssl_key_password=[password]</b>
              Only needed for loading an encrypted certificate.

       <b>ssl_cert_password=[password]</b>
              Synonym for ssl_key_password.

       <b>ssl_peer_cn=[string]</b>
              Must  match  the  common  name  in  the SSL certificate that the server gives when it connects. If
              ssl_peer_cn is not set, the server name will be used instead.

       <b>ssl_ciphers=[cipher</b> <b>list]</b>
              Allowed SSL ciphers. See openssl ciphers for details.

       <b>server_can_override_includes=[0|1]</b>
              To prevent the server from being able to override your local include/exclude list, set this to  0.
              The default is 1.

       <b>server_can_restore=[0|1]</b>
              To  prevent  the  server  from initiating restores, set this to 0. The default is 1. You will also
              need to give a location for the files to be restored to with the 'restoreprefix' option.

       <b>restoreprefix=[path]</b>
              When restoring, this path will be prefixed to the restore  path.  The  '-d'  command  line  option
              overrides this setting. This setting is required if you are using server initiated restores.

       <b>encryption_password=[password]</b>
              Set  this  to enable client side file AES-CBC-256 encryption. If you do not want encryption, leave
              this field out of your config file. <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Configuring an  encryption_password  renders  delta
              differencing  pointless,  since  the  smallest real change to a file will make the whole file look
              different. Therefore, activating this option turns off  delta  differencing  so  that  whenever  a
              client  file  changes,  the whole new file will be uploaded on the next backup. <b>ALSO</b> <b>IMPORTANT:</b> If
              you manage to lose your encryption password, you will not be able to  unencrypt  your  files.  You
              should  therefore  think about having a copy of the encryption password somewhere off-box, in case
              of your client hard disk failing. Take care when copying and pasting  special  characters  between
              client  conf  files,  as  the  encoding  of  the  config file matters. <b>FINALLY:</b> If you change your
              encryption password, you will end up with  a  mixture  of  files  on  the  server  with  different
              encryption  and  it may become tricky to restore more than one file at a time. For this reason, if
              you change your encryption password, you may want to start a fresh chain of backups (by moving the
              original set aside, for example). Burp will cope fine with turning the same encryption password on
              and off between backups, and will restore a  backup  of  mixed  encrypted  and  unencrypted  files
              without a problem.

       <b>glob_after_script_pre=[0|1]</b>
              Set  this  to  0  if you do not want include_glob settings to be evaluated after the pre script is
              run. The default is 1.

       <b>backup_script_pre=[path]</b>
              Path to a script to run before a backup. It is not run if the server decides it is  not  yet  time
              for  a  backup.  The  arguments  to  it  are 'pre', 'reserved2' to 'reserved5', and then arguments
              defined by backup_script_pre_arg - unless the option 'backup_script_reserved_args'  is  off,  then
              only  arguments  defined  by backup_script_pre_arg are passed to it. If the script fails (ie. when
              the return code is not 0), then the backup is aborted.

       <b>backup_script_pre_arg=[string]</b>
              A user-definable argument to the backup pre script. You can have many of these.

       <b>backup_script_post=[path]</b>
              Path to a script to run after a backup. The arguments to it are 'post', [0|1] if the backup failed
              or succeeded, 'reserved3' to 'reserved5', and then arguments defined by  backup_script_post_arg  -
              unless   the   option  'backup_script_reserved_args'  is  off,  then  only  arguments  defined  by
              backup_script_post_arg are passed to it.

       <b>backup_script_post_arg=[string]</b>
              A user-definable argument to the backup post script. You can have many of these.

       <b>backup_script_post_run_on_fail=[0|1]</b>
              If this is set to 1, backup_script_post will be run  whether  the  backup  succeeds  or  not.  The
              default is 0, which means that backup_script_post will only be run if the backup succeeds.

       <b>restore_script_pre=[path]</b>
              Path  to  a  script  to  run  before  a  restore.  The  arguments  to it are 'pre', 'reserved2' to
              'reserved5',  and  then  arguments  defined  by  restore_script_pre_arg  -   unless   the   option
              'restore_script_reserved_args'  is  off, then only arguments defined by restore_script_pre_arg are
              passed to it.

       <b>restore_script_pre_arg=[string]</b>
              A user-definable argument to the restore pre script. You can have many of these.

       <b>restore_script_post=[path]</b>
              Path to a script to run after a restore. The arguments to it are  'post',  [0|1]  if  the  restore
              failed   or   succeeded,   'reserved3'   to   'reserved5',   and   then   arguments   defined   by
              restore_script_post_arg - unless the  option  'restore_script_reserved_args'  is  off,  then  only
              arguments defined by restore_script_post_arg are passed to it.

       <b>restore_script_post_arg=[string]</b>
              A user-definable argument to the restore post script. You can have many of these.

       <b>restore_script_post_run_on_fail=[0|1]</b>
              If  this  is  set  to  1, restore_script_post will be run whether the restore succeeds or not. The
              default is 0, which means that restore_script_post will only be run if the restore succeeds.

       <b>backup_script=[path]</b>
              You can use this to save space in your config file when you want to run the same script before and
              after a backup. It overrides backup_script_pre and backup_script_post.

       <b>backup_script_arg=[path]</b>
              Goes with backup_script and overrides backup_script_pre_arg and backup_script_post_arg.

       <b>backup_script_reserved_args=[0|1]</b>
              Whether to pass reserved arguments to backup scripts. The default is on.

       <b>restore_script=[path]</b>
              You can use this to save space in your config file when you want to run the same script before and
              after a restore. It overrides restore_script_pre and restore_script_post.

       <b>restore_script_arg=[path]</b>
              Goes with restore_script and overrides restore_script_pre_arg and restore_script_post_arg.

       <b>restore_script_reserved_args=[0|1]</b>
              Whether to pass reserved arguments to restore scripts. The default is on.

       <b>autoupgrade_dir=[path]</b>
              Path to autoupgrade directory into which upgrades are downloaded. Please see  docs/autoupgrade.txt
              in  the  source  package  for  more  help  with  this  option.  If  you do not want your client to
              autoupgrade, do not set this option.

       <b>autoupgrade_os=[string]</b>
              Name  of  the  client  operating  system.  Should  match  a  directory  name   in   the   server's
              autoupgrade_dir. If you do not want your client to autoupgrade, do not set this option.

       <b>monitor_exe=[path]</b>
              Where  to  look to find the burp binary to use when forking a monitor client. This might be needed
              on systems that don't have any sensible way  to  self-determine  a  process'  own  path,  such  as
              openbsd.

</pre><h4><b>INCLUDES</b> <b>/</b> <b>EXCLUDES</b></h4><pre>
       The following options specify exactly what is backed up. The client can specify these options, or if you
       include at least one 'include=' or 'include_glob=' in the client configuration files on the server, the
       server will override them all.

       <b>include=[path]</b>
              Path  to  include in the backup. You can have multiple include lines. Use forward slashes '/', not
              backslashes '\' as path delimiters.

       <b>exclude=[path]</b>
              Path to exclude from the backup. You can have multiple exclude lines. Use forward slashes '/', not
              backslashes '\' as path delimiters.

       <b>include_glob=[glob</b> <b>expression]</b>
              Include paths that match the  glob  expression.  For  example,  '<a href="file:/home/">/home/</a>*/Documents'  will  include
              '/home/user1/Documents'  and  '/home/user2/Documents'  if directories 'user1' and 'user2' exist in
              '<a href="file:/home">/home</a>'. The Windows implementation currently limits the expression to contain only one '*',  with
              one exception - you may also specify '*:' to expand to detected fixed drives.

       <b>include_regex=[regular</b> <b>expression]</b>
              Include paths that match the regular expression. You need at least one 'include' or 'include_glob'
              option  to  have  files  to be matched against the regex. If you have at least one 'include_regex'
              line, then any path NOT matching the regex will be excluded from your backup.

       <b>exclude_regex=[regular</b> <b>expression]</b>
              Exclude paths that match the regular expression.

       <b>include_logic=[logic</b> <b>expression]</b>
              Not yet implemented. See 'exclude_logic' for details on the 'logic expression' syntax.

       <b>exclude_logic=[logic</b> <b>expression]</b>
              Exclude paths that match the 'logic expression'. A 'logic expression' may  contain  several  tests
              chained  with boolean operators. The supported operators are: 'and', 'or', 'not' as well as groups
              of expressions surrounded by parentheses. The  supported  tests  are:  'file_size',  'file_match',
              'path_match'  and 'file_ext'. The 'file_size' test supports comparisons with '&gt;', '&gt;=', '&lt;', '&lt;=',
              '=' and take a size  as  parameter,  example:  'file_size&lt;=5Mb'.  The  'file_ext'  test  takes  an
              extension as parameter, example: 'file_ext=pst'. Finally, the 'file_match'  and 'path_match' tests
              take  a  regular  expression as parameter, example: file_match=b$. 'file_match' is ran against the
              filename (example 'file1') while 'path_match' is ran against the full path of the  file  (example:
              '/home/test/file1'). A complete expression may look like '(file_size&gt;=5Mb and file_size&lt;=10Mb) and
              (file_ext=pst  or  file_match=movies)  and  not  file_ext=mp3'. There are some limitations though,
              white-spaces and parentheses must be escaped inside a test either by  quoting  the  expression  or
              escaping a given character: 'file_match="perso(nnal)?"', 'file_match=a filename'.

       <b>include_ext=[extension]</b>
              Extensions  to  include  in  the  backup.  Case  insensitive. Nothing else will be included in the
              backup. You can have multiple include extension lines. For example, set  'txt'  to  include  files
              that  end  in  '.txt'.  You  need  to  specify an 'include' line so that burp knows where to start
              looking.

       <b>exclude_ext=[extension]</b>
              Extensions to exclude from the backup. Case insensitive. You can have multiple  exclude  extension
              lines. For example, set 'vdi' to exclude VirtualBox disk images.

       <b>exclude_comp=[extension]</b>
              Extensions  to  exclude  from  compression.  Case  insensitive.  You  can  have  multiple  exclude
              compression lines. For example, set 'gz' to exclude gzipped files from compression.

       <b>exclude_fs=[fstype]</b>
              File systems to exclude from the backup. Case insensitive. You  can  have  multiple  exclude  file
              system  lines.  For  example,  set  'tmpfs' to exclude tmpfs. Burp has an internal mapping of file
              system names to file system IDs. If you know the file system ID, you can  use  that  instead.  For
              example, 'exclude_fs = 0x01021994' will also exclude tmpfs.

       <b>include_fs=[fstype]</b>
              File  systems  to  include  into  the backup. Case insensitive. You can have multiple include file
              system lines. For example, set 'ext4' to include ext4. Burp has an internal mapping of file system
              names to file system IDs. If you know the file system ID, you can use that instead.  For  example,
              'include_fs  =  0x01021994'  will also include tmpfs. If at least one file system is included, all
              other filesystems will be excluded per default. Included  directories  that  do  not  live  on  an
              included  file  system  will be skipped, even if <b>cross_all_filesystems</b> is enabled and they contain
              subdirectories with included file systems.

              Note that on SunOS systems <b>include_fs</b> and <b>exclude_fs</b> will do  a  case  sensitive  compare  of  the
              string descriptors of the file systems instead of the numeric IDs (see <b>f_basetype</b> member is <b>struct</b>
              <b>statvfs</b>).

       <b>min_file_size=[B/KB/MB/GB]</b>
              Do  not  back up files that are less than the specified size. Example: 'min_file_size = 10MB'. Set
              to 0 (the default) to have no limit.

       <b>max_file_size=[B/KB/MB/GB]</b>
              Do not back up files that are greater than the specified size. Example:  'max_file_size  =  10MB'.
              Set to 0 (the default) to have no limit.

       <b>cross_filesystem=[path]</b>
              Allow backups to cross a particular filesystem mountpoint.

       <b>cross_all_filesystems=[0|1]</b>
              Allow backups to cross all filesystem mountpoints.

       <b>nobackup=[file</b> <b>name]</b>
              If  this  file  system entry exists, the content of the directory containing it will not be backed
              up.

       <b>read_fifo=[path]</b>
              Do not back up the given fifo itself, but open it for reading and back up the contents  as  if  it
              were a regular file.

       <b>read_all_fifos=[0|1]</b>
              Open all fifos for reading and back up the contents as if they were regular files.

       <b>read_blockdev=[path]</b>
              Do  not back up the given block device itself, but open it for reading and back up the contents as
              if it were a regular file.

       <b>read_all_blockdevs=[0|1]</b>
              Open all block devices for reading and back up the contents as if they were regular files.

       <b>split_vss=[0|1]</b>
              When backing up Windows computers, this option allows you to save the  VSS  header  data  separate
              from the file data. The default is off, which means that the VSS header data is saved prepended to
              the file data.

       <b>strip_vss=[0|1]</b>
              When  backing  up  Windows  computers, this option allows you to prevent the VSS header data being
              backed up. The default is off. To restore a backup that has no VSS  information  on  Windows,  you
              need to give the client the '-x' command line option.

       <b>vss_drives=[list</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive</b> <b>letters]</b>
              When  backing  up  Windows  computers,  this  option  allows  you to specify which drives have VSS
              snapshots taken of them. If you omit this option, burp will  automatically  decide  based  on  the
              'include' options. If you want no drives to have snapshots taken of them, you can specify '0'.

       <b>acl=[0|1]</b>
              If  acl  support is compiled into burp, this allows you to decide whether or not to backup acls at
              runtime. The default is '1'.

       <b>xattr=[0|1]</b>
              If xattr support is compiled into burp, this allows you to decide whether or not to backup  xattrs
              at runtime. The default is '1'.

       <b>atime=[0|1]</b>
              This  allows  you to control whether the client uses O_NOATIME when opening files and directories.
              The default is 0, which enables  O_NOATIME.  This  means  that  the  client  can  read  files  and
              directories  without  updating the access times. However, this is only possible if you are running
              as root, or are the owner of the file or directory. If this is not the case (perhaps you only have
              group or world access to the files), you will get errors until you set atime=1. With atime=1,  the
              access times will be updated on the files and directories that get backed up.

       <b>scan_problem_raises_error=[0|1]</b>
              When  enabled,  this causes problems in the phase1 scan (such as an 'include' being missing) to be
              treated as fatal errors. The default is off.

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>CLIENTCONFDIR</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       For the server to know about clients that can contact it, you need to place a file named after the client
       in clientconfdir. Files beginning with '.' or ending with '~' are ignored. Directories are also ignored.

       The file name must match the name in the 'cname' field on the client.

       <b>ssl_peer_cn=[string]</b> must match the common name in the SSL certificate that the client gives when it
       connects. If ssl_peer_cn is not set, the client name will be used instead (the clientconfdir file name).

       The file needs to contain a line like <b>password=[password]</b> that matches the same field on the client, or
       <b>passwd=[hash]</b> - where the plain text password on the client will be tested against a hash of the kind you
       might find in /etc/passwd.

       Additionally, the following options can be overridden here for each client:
              <b>client_can_delete</b> <b>client_can_force_backup</b>  <b>client_can_list</b>  <b>client_can_monitor</b>  <b>client_can_restore</b>
              <b>client_can_verify</b>   <b>client_lockdir</b>   <b>compression</b>   <b>dedup_group</b>  <b>directory</b>  <b>directory_tree</b>  <b>enabled</b>
              <b>fail_on_warning</b> <b>hard_quota</b>  <b>keep</b>  <b>label</b>  <b>librsync</b>  <b>librsync_max_size</b>  <b>manual_delete</b>  <b>network_allow</b>
              <b>network_allow_status</b>        <b>notify_failure_arg</b>        <b>notify_failure_on_backup_with_failovers_left</b>
              <b>notify_failure_on_backup_working_dir_deletion</b>       <b>notify_failure_script</b>       <b>notify_success_arg</b>
              <b>notify_success_script</b> <b>notify_success_warnings_only</b> <b>password_check</b> <b>path_length_warn</b> <b>rblk_memory_max</b>
              <b>restore_client</b>   <b>server_script_arg</b>   <b>server_script</b>   <b>server_script_notify</b>   <b>server_script_post_arg</b>
              <b>server_script_post</b> <b>server_script_post_notify</b> <b>server_script_post_run_on_fail</b>  <b>server_script_pre_arg</b>
              <b>server_script_pre</b>    <b>server_script_pre_notify</b>    <b>soft_quota</b>    <b>super_client</b>    <b>syslog</b>    <b>timer_arg</b>
              <b>timer_repeat_interval</b> <b>timer_script</b> <b>timestamp_format</b> <b>version_warn</b> <b>working_dir_recovery_method</b>

       Additionally, the includes and excludes can be overridden here, as described in the section above.

       As with the other configuration files, extra configuration can be included with the '.
       path/to/config/file' syntax.

</pre><h4><b>Some</b> <b>notes</b> <b>on</b> <b>SSL</b> <b>certificates</b></h4><pre>
       The burp example configs come with example SSL certificates and keys. You can use these and burp will
       work. But if you are worried about network security, you should generate your own certificates and keys
       and point your config files to them. To create the example files, I used a handy interface to openssl,
       called 'tinyca' (<a href="http://tinyca.sm-zone.net/">http://tinyca.sm-zone.net/</a>). If you are using Debian, you can run 'apt-get install
       tinyca' to get it. There is also the option of using burp_ca, which you can find in the source
       distribution, courtesy of Patrick Koppen.

</pre><h4><b>Examining</b> <b>backups</b></h4><pre>
       As well as using the client list options described above, you can go directly to the storage directory on
       the server. The backups for a client are in the directory named after the client. Inside each backup
       directory is a file called manifest.gz.

       This contains a list of all the files in the backup, and where they originally came from on the client.

       There is also a 'log.gz' file in the backup directory, which contains the output generated by the server
       during the backup.

       The 'data' directory contains complete backup files.

       The 'deltas.reverse' directory contains reverse deltas that can be applied to the data from the next
       backup in the sequence (indicated by the contents of the 'forward' file).

       Anything with a .gz suffix is compressed in zlib (gzip) format.  You can use standard tools, such as
       zcat, zless or cp, to view them or copy them elsewhere. Files from Windows backups will probably contain
       VSS headers and/or footers. For help stripping these, see the vss_strip man page.

</pre><h4><b>Server</b> <b>initiated</b> <b>backups</b></h4><pre>
       You can queue a backup on the server, to be performed when the client next makes contact. To do this, you
       put a file called 'backup' into the top level of the client storage directory. The contents of the file
       are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>Server</b> <b>initiated</b> <b>restores</b></h4><pre>
       You can queue a restore on the server, to be performed when the client next makes contact. To do this,
       you put a file called 'restore' into the top level of the client storage directory. The client can deny
       server initiated restores by setting "server_can_restore=0" in its burp.conf. The client also needs to
       specify 'restoreprefix' in its configuration as a destination for the restored files. Valid fields to
       include in the restore file are:

       <b>orig_client=[client]</b>
              The original client to restore from. Equivalent to '-C' when initiating a restore from  a  client.
              Do  not include this line when restoring to the original client. See also the 'restore_client' and
              'super_client' server options.

       <b>backup=[number|a]</b>
              The number of the backup to restore from. Equivalent to '-b' when initiating a  restore  from  the
              client.

       <b>overwrite=[0|1]</b>
              Whether to overwrite existing files. Equivalent to '-f' when initiating a restore from the client.

       <b>strip=[number]</b>
              Number  of leading path components to strip. Equivalent to '-s' when initiating a restore from the
              client.

       <b>restoreprefix=[path]</b>
              Appended to the client-side 'restoreprefix' setting, and then prefixed to the restore path.

       <b>stripfrompath=[string]</b>
              Strip matching string from restore paths (before prefix is prepended).

       <b>regex=[regular</b> <b>expression]</b>
              Only restore files matching the regular expression. Equivalent to '-r' when initiating  a  restore
              from the client.

       <b>include=[path]</b>
              Restore  directories  and  files  that  match  the path. If it is a directory, the contents of the
              directory will be restored. You can have multiple 'include' lines. There  is  no  equivalent  when
              initiating a restore from the client.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       Sending  signal  1  (HUP)  to  the  main server process will cause it to reload. For the vast majority of
       configuration changes, a reload is unnecessary as the server will pick up changes  "on-the-fly".  Sending
       signal  12  (USR2)  to  the main server process will cause it to wait until there are no longer any child
       processes, and then exit. The intention is to help with upgrades without interrupting current backups. if
       you are running upstart, a new burp server process will start up when the old one exits.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>CODES</b> <b>(SERVER)</b></h4><pre>
       0: success
       1: error

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>CODES</b> <b>(CLIENT)</b></h4><pre>
       0: success
       1: error
       2: restore gave warnings
       3: timer conditions on the server were not met
       4: could not connect to server
       5: max parallel backups reached
