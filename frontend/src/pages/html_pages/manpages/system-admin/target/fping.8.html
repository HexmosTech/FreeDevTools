</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fping - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fping</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>systems...</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fping</b> is a program like <b>ping</b> which uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request to
       determine if a target host is responding.  <b>fping</b> differs from <b>ping</b> in that you can specify any number of
       targets on the command line, or specify a file containing the lists of targets to ping.  Instead of
       sending to one target until it times out or replies, <b>fping</b> will send out a ping packet and move on to the
       next target in a round-robin fashion.  In the default mode, if a target replies, it is noted and removed
       from the list of targets to check; if a target does not respond within a certain time limit and/or retry
       limit it is designated as unreachable. <b>fping</b> also supports sending a specified number of pings to a
       target, or looping indefinitely (as in <b>ping</b> ). Unlike <b>ping</b>, <b>fping</b> is meant to be used in scripts, so its
       output is designed to be easy to parse.  Current statistics can be obtained without termination of
       process with signal SIGQUIT (^\ from the keyboard on most systems).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-4</b>, <b>--ipv4</b>
            Restrict name resolution and IPs to IPv4 addresses.

       <b>-6</b>, <b>--ipv6</b>
            Restrict name resolution and IPs to IPv6 addresses.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--alive</b>
            Show systems that are alive.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--addr</b>
            Display  targets  by  address rather than DNS name. Combined with -d, the output will be both the ip
            and (if available) the hostname.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--size</b>=<u>BYTES</u>
            Number of bytes of ping data to send.  The minimum size (normally 12) allows room for the data  that
            <b>fping</b>  needs  to do its work (sequence number, timestamp).  The reported received data size includes
            the IP header (normally 20 bytes) and ICMP header (8 bytes), so the minimum total size is 40  bytes.
            Default  is  56,  as in <b>ping</b>. Maximum is the theoretical maximum IP datagram size (64K), though most
            systems limit this to a smaller, system-dependent number.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--backoff</b>=<u>N</u>
            Backoff factor. In the default mode, <b>fping</b> sends several requests to  a  target  before  giving  up,
            waiting  longer  for  a  reply on each successive request.  This parameter is the value by which the
            wait time (<b>-t</b>) is multiplied on each successive request; it must  be  entered  as  a  floating-point
            number (x.y). The default is 1.5.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--count</b>=<u>N</u>
            Number  of  request  packets  to  send  to  each target.  In this mode, a line is displayed for each
            received response (this can suppressed with <b>-q</b> or <b>-Q</b>).  Also, statistics about  responses  for  each
            target are displayed when all requests have been sent (or when interrupted).

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--vcount</b>=<u>N</u>
            Similar  to  <b>-c</b>,  but  the  per-target  statistics  are displayed in a format designed for automated
            response-time statistics gathering. For example:

             $ fping -C 5 -q somehost
             somehost : 91.7 37.0 29.2 - 36.8

            shows the response time in milliseconds for each of the five requests, with the "-" indicating  that
            no response was received to the fourth request.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--rdns</b>
            Use  DNS  to  lookup address of ping target. This allows you to give fping a list of IP addresses as
            input and print hostnames in the output. This is similar to  option  <b>-n</b>/<b>--name</b>,  but  will  force  a
            reverse-DNS lookup even if you give hostnames as target (NAME-&gt;IP-&gt;NAME).

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--timestamp</b>
            Add Unix timestamps in front of output lines generated with in looping or counting modes (<b>-l</b>, <b>-c</b>, or
            <b>-C</b>).

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--elapsed</b>
            Show elapsed (round-trip) time of packets.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--file</b>
            Read  list  of  targets  from  a file.  This option can only be used by the root user. Regular users
            should pipe in the file via stdin:

             $ fping &lt; targets_file

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--generate</b> <u>addr/mask</u>
            Generate a target list from a supplied IP netmask, or a starting and ending IP.  Specify the netmask
            or start/end in the targets portion of the command line. If a network with  netmask  is  given,  the
            network  and  broadcast  addresses  will  be  excluded.  ex. To ping the network 192.168.1.0/24, the
            specified command line could look like either:

             $ fping -g 192.168.1.0/24

            or

             $ fping -g 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.254

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Print usage message.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--ttl</b>=<u>N</u>
            Set the IP TTL field (time to live hops).

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--interval</b>=<u>MSEC</u>
            The minimum amount of time (in milliseconds) between sending a ping packet to any target (default is
            10, minimum is 1).

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--iface</b>=<u>IFACE</u>
            Set the interface (requires SO_BINDTODEVICE support).

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--loop</b>
            Loop sending packets to each target indefinitely. Can be interrupted with Ctrl-C;  statistics  about
            responses for each target are then displayed.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--all</b>
            Send pings to each of a target host's multiple IP addresses (use of option '-A' is recommended).

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--dontfrag</b>
            Set the "Don't Fragment" bit in the IP header (used to determine/test the MTU).

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--name</b>
            If  targets are specified as IP addresses, do a reverse-DNS lookup on them to print hostnames in the
            output.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--netdata</b>
            Format output for netdata (-l -Q are required). See: &lt;<a href="http://my-netdata.io/">http://my-netdata.io/</a>&gt;

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--outage</b>
            Calculate "outage time" based on the number of lost pings and the interval used (useful for  network
            convergence tests).

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--tos</b>=<u>N</u>
            Set the typ of service flag (TOS). <u>N</u> can be either decimal or hexadecimal (0xh) format.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--period</b>=<u>MSEC</u>
            In  looping  or  counting  modes  (<b>-l</b>, <b>-c</b>, or <b>-C</b>), this parameter sets the time in milliseconds that
            <b>fping</b> waits between successive packets to an individual target. Default is 1000 and minimum is 10.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
            Quiet. Don't show per-probe results, but  only  the  final  summary.  Also  don't  show  ICMP  error
            messages.

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--squiet</b>=<u>SECS</u>
            Like <b>-q</b>, but additionally show interval summary results every <u>SECS</u> seconds.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--retry</b>=<u>N</u>
            Retry  limit  (default  3). This is the number of times an attempt at pinging a target will be made,
            not including the first try.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--random</b>
            Instead of using all-zeros as the packet data, generate random bytes.  Use  to  defeat,  e.g.,  link
            data compression.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--stats</b>
            Print cumulative statistics upon exit.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--src</b>=<u>addr</u>
            Set source address.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--timeout</b>=<u>MSEC</u>
            Initial target timeout in milliseconds. In the default, non-loop mode, the default timeout is 500ms,
            and  it  represents  the  amount  of  time  that  <b>fping</b>  waits  for a response to its first request.
            Successive timeouts are multiplied by the backoff factor specified with <b>-B</b>.

            In loop/count mode, the default timeout is automatically adjusted to match the "period"  value  (but
            not  more than 2000ms). You can still adjust the timeout value with this option, if you wish to, but
            note that setting a value larger than "period" produces inconsistent results,  because  the  timeout
            value can be respected only for the last ping.

            Also note that any received replies that are larger than the timeout value, will be discarded.

       <b>-T</b> <u>n</u> Ignored (for compatibility with fping 2.4).

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--unreach</b>
            Show targets that are unreachable.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
            Print <b>fping</b> version information.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--reachable</b>=<u>N</u>
            Given  a list of hosts, this mode checks if number of reachable hosts is &gt;= N and exits true in that
            case.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Generate 20 pings to two hosts in ca. 1 second (i.e. one ping every 50 ms to each host), and report every
       ping RTT at the end:

        $ fping --quiet --interval=1 --vcount=20 --period=50 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.2

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Exit status is 0 if all the hosts are reachable, 1 if some hosts were unreachable, 2 if any IP  addresses
       were not found, 3 for invalid command line arguments, and 4 for a system call failure.

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If  fping  was  configured with "--enable-safe-limits", the following values are not allowed for non-root
       users:

       •   <b>-i</b> <u>n</u>, where <u>n</u> &lt; 1 msec

       •   <b>-p</b> <u>n</u>, where <u>n</u> &lt; 10 msec
