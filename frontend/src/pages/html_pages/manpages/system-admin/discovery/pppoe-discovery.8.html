</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pppoe-discovery - perform PPPoE discovery

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pppoe-discovery</b> [ <u>options</u> ]
       <b>pppoe-discovery</b> { <b>-V</b> | <b>-h</b> }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pppoe-discovery</b>  performs the same discovery process as <b>pppoe</b>, but does not initiate a session.  It sends
       a PADI packet and then prints the names of access concentrators in each PADO packet it receives.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-I</b> <u>interface</u>
              The <b>-I</b> option specifies the Ethernet interface to use.  Under Linux, it is typically eth0 or eth1.
              The interface should be “up” before you start <b>pppoe-discovery</b>, but should  <u>not</u>  be  configured  to
              have an IP address.  The default interface is eth0.

       <b>-D</b> <u>file_name</u>
              The  <b>-D</b>  option causes every packet to be dumped to the specified <u>file_name</u>.  This is intended for
              debugging only.

       <b>-U</b>
              Causes <b>pppoe-discovery</b> to use the Host-Uniq tag in its discovery packets. The value of the tag  is
              derived  from  the  process's PID number.  This lets you run multiple instances of <b>pppoe-discovery</b>
              and/or <b>pppd</b> without having their discovery packets interfere with one another.   You  must  supply
              this  option  to  <u>all</u>  instances  that  you intend to run simultaneously.  This option is mutually
              exclusive with <b>-W</b>.

       <b>-W</b> <u>value</u>
              Causes <b>pppoe-discovery</b> to use the Host-Uniq tag in its discovery packets. The value of the tag  is
              taken  from  the  option  argument,  encoded as a string of hexadecimal digits.  This lets you run
              multiple instances of <b>pppoe-discovery</b> and/or <b>pppd</b> without having their discovery packets interfere
              with one another.  You  must  supply  this  option  to  <u>all</u>  instances  that  you  intend  to  run
              simultaneously.  This option is mutually exclusive with <b>-U</b>.

       <b>-S</b> <u>service_name</u>
              Specifies  the  desired service name.  <b>pppoe-discovery</b> will only accept access concentrators which
              can provide the specified service.  In most cases, you should <u>not</u> specify  this  option.   Use  it
              only  if  you  know  that there are multiple access concentrators or know that you need a specific
              service name.

       <b>-C</b> <u>ac_name</u>
              Specifies the desired access concentrator name.  <b>pppoe-discovery</b> will only  accept  the  specified
              access  concentrator.  In most cases, you should <u>not</u> specify this option.  Use it only if you know
              that there are multiple access concentrators.  If both the <b>-S</b> and <b>-C</b> options are  specified,  they
              must <u>both</u> match.

       <b>-Q</b>
              Causes <b>pppoe-discovery</b> to avoid printing discovered access concentrator names.  This can be useful
              in  scripts,  which  can use the exit code of the program to determine whether any matching access
              concentrators were discovered.

       <b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u>
              Changes the discovery timeout for PADI requests, in seconds.  The default value is 5 seconds.

       <b>-a</b> <u>attempts</u>
              Changes the number of PADI discovery attempts made.  By default, 3 attempts are made  to  discover
              access concentrators before giving up.

       <b>-V</b> | <b>-h</b>
              Either  of these options causes <b>pppoe-discovery</b> to print its version number and usage information,
              then exit.
