</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/usr/sbin/lm-profiler</u> - laptop mode profiler

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/usr/sbin/lm-profiler</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <u>/usr/sbin/lm-profiler</u> command. lm-profiler is a tool for profiling
       disk  operations. It is a part of laptop mode tools and is useful only in relation to rest of laptop mode
       tools. It helps you to detect programs and services that use up system  resources  and  that  cause  disk
       activity, and it allows you to disable them when laptop mode is active.

       When  you  start  lm-profiler,  it  will  execute  a "profiling run", which can take some time. Start lm-
       profiler when you are working on batteries, preferably, because that will allow it to analyze the  actual
       situation  that  it  is supposed to optimize. During the profiling run, you can use your system normally;
       however, any disk activity caused by your actions will  end  up  in  the  profiler's  results.  When  the
       profiling  run  is  finished,  you will be presented with a list of programs that deserve your attention,
       either because they listen on a network (which is not usually useful when you  are  working  offline)  or
       because  they  caused  disk activity in a disk-spindown-unfriendly pattern. When lm-profiler can guess an
       init script that belongs to a program, it presents you with the opportunity to disable the  program  when
       you  are  working on battery. It does this by placing a link to the init script in /etc/laptop-mode/batt-
       stop. Any programs that lm-profiler cannot find an init script for is simply reported, so  that  you  can
       stop the program manually if you want to.

       <b>WARNING</b>  <b>ABOUT</b>  <b>DISABLING</b>  <b>PROGRAMS:</b>  It may not be safe to disable some programs. They may be needed for
       proper operation of your system. Disable services only if you know what they do and why  you  don't  need
       them.
