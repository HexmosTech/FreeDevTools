</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/laptop-mode/lm-profiler.conf</u> - Configuration file for <u>lm-profiler</u>, a profiler for laptop-mode-tools.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  documents  the  options  that  can  be  set  in the <u>/etc/laptop-mode/lm-profiler.conf</u>
       configuration file.  For a description of what lm-profiler does, see the <a href="../man8/lm-profiler.8.html">lm-profiler</a>(8) manpage.

</pre><h4><b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The syntax of options is <b>OPTION=value</b>.

       The following settings are available in <u>lm-profiler.conf</u>:

       <b>VERBOSE_OUTPUT</b>
                 Set this to 1 if you want to see a lot of output when you run lm-profiler, and 0 if  you  don't
                 want this. Useful for debugging purposes. (Currently does nothing.)

       <b>PROFILE_RUN_LENGTH</b>
                 The  length  of  a  profiling  run, in seconds. This should be a while, so that lm-profiler can
                 gather enough information. The default is 10 minutes (600 seconds).

       <b>ACTIVITY_INTERVAL_MIN</b>

       <b>ACTIVITY_INTERVAL_MAX</b>
                 The behaviour that you want to avoid when you have your hard drive spun down, is disk  accesses
                 that  are  spread  out over time, because your hard drive will have to spin up for each access.
                 lm-profiler detects when applications perform disk accesses that are at least some  time  apart
                 (otherwise  they  can  be  considered part of the same access) but not TOO far apart (otherwise
                 they are no problem). These settings configure what lm-profiler considers "at least  some  time
                 apart" and "too far apart", respectively, in seconds.

       <b>RECOMMEND_DEFAULT_SERVICES</b>

       <b>DEFAULT_SERVICES</b>
                 If  <b>RECOMMEND_DEFAULT_SERVICES</b>  is  set  to  1  (enabled), then lm-profiler will always suggest
                 turning off the services listed in <b>DEFAULT_SERVICES</b> (separated by spaces).

       <b>IGNORE_PROGRAMS</b>
                 Programs listed in this option,  separated  by  spaces,  will  be  ignored  for  disk  activity
                 profiling.  The  default  settings  (which  can  be referenced as <b>$DEF_IGNORE_PROGRAMS</b>) include
                 common utility programs and all programs used by lm-profiler itself.

       <b>RECOMMEND_NETWORK_SERVICES</b>
                 When this option is enabled (value 1), lm-profiler will detect any services that are  listening
                 on network ports, and it will suggest that you disable them.

       <b>IGNORE_NETWORK_SERVICES</b>
                 Services  listed  in  this  configuration  option  (separated by spaces) are not suggested as a
                 network   service   by   lm-profiler.   The    default    values    can    be    accessed    as
                 <b>$DEF_IGNORE_NETWORK_SERVICES</b>.
