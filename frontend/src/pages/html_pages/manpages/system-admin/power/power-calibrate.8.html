</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       power-calibrate - a tool to calibrate power consumption.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>power-calibrate</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Power-calibrate  calibrates the power consumption of a mobile device that has a battery power source or a
       recent Intel processor using the RAPL (Running Average  Power  Limit)  interface.   It  will  attempt  to
       calculate  the  power  usage  of  1% of CPU utiltisation. If perf is available, power-calibrate will also
       attempt to estimate the power consumption of 1 CPU cycle and 1 CPU instruction (one may need  to  run  as
       root or set <a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid">/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid</a> to below 2 for this to work).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       power-calibrate options are as follow:

       <b>-d</b>     specify  the  delay  in  seconds  from  starting  a new test configuration and before starting the
              sampling. The default is 20 seconds, which is normally enough time to allow the battery statistics
              to settle down during the current test.

       <b>-e</b>     Calibrate for each CPU run, rather than for all the CPUs.  By default,  power-calibrate  will  run
              tests  on all the CPUs and produce one set of results for all the runs. While this provides a good
              average result, it may be misleading for processors where power utilisation or performance is  not
              uniform across the processors, for example, with hyperthreading.

       <b>-h</b>     show help.

       <b>-n</b>     specify a list CPU numbers to run on.  By default, the number of CPUs is determined automatically,
              but  this option allows one to override this by listing the CPUs (range 0..number of CPUs-1) using
              a comma separated list.

       <b>-o</b> <b>file</b>
              output results into a YAML formatted file.

       <b>-p</b>     show progress. This will display the progress in terms of % completion of a test run  and  also  %
              completion  of  the total run.  The progress is based on work done rather than on an accurate time
              estimate.

       <b>-r</b> <b>secs</b>
              Set run duration. Normally, the default of 120 seconds is suitable for most laptop  devices  where
              discharge  rates from the battery can be fairly accurately determined over this duration.  Setting
              this to a shorter duration will complete the calibration tests  in  less  time  but  may  be  less
              accurate.

       <b>-R</b>     read  power  statistics  from the RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) domains. This is supported by
              recent Linux kernels and Sandybridge and later Intel processors.  This option  just  measures  the
              per processor package power utilization so the readings do not cover the entire machine.

       <b>-s</b> <b>samples</b>
              specify  the  number  of  samples  for the CPU (-c) test. The CPU test will measure 0% to 100% CPU
              loading across 1..number of CPUs. The number of test rounds to be done per CPU  is  controlled  by
              the  samples  value.   If samples is low then less data points are gathered for the calculation of
              the power utilisation and this leads to less accurate results.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       During the testing/data sampling phase, power-calibrate will show the following information:
       <b>Column</b>    <b>Description</b>
       CPU load  The loading of each CPU in terms of % utilisation for each CPU and the  number  of  CPUs  being
                 loaded. For example, 80% x 2 means 2 CPUs each at 80% utilisation and for an 8 CPU machine this
                 is effectivly 20% total utilisation since 6 other CPUs are idle.
       User      % load of the CPU consumed by user space programs.
       Sys       % load of the CPU consumed by the kernel.
       Idle      % idle time of the CPU.
       Ctxt/s    Context switches per second.
       IRQ/s     Interrupts per second.
       Ops/s     Bogo  operations  per second.  This is the number of compute operations per second (computation
                 of a random number using a 32 bit multiple-with-carry).
       Watts     Power used in Watts.

       The following is an example of the output for the -c option:

       Power (Watts) = (% CPU load * 0.424631) + 10.131925
       Each 1% CPU load is about 424.63 mW (about 37.87 mA @ 11.21 V)
       Coefficient of determination R^2 = 0.999015 (very strong)

       Power (Watts) = (bogo op * 4.267444e-08) + 10.666399
       1 bogo ops is about 42.67 nW (about 3.81 nA @ 11.21 V)
       Coefficient of determination R^2 = 0.999460 (very strong)

       Power-calibrate will determine a suitable way of calculating the power consumed based on the CPU load and
       an estimation of the amount of power consumed for each 1% of CPU loading.

       The Coefficient of determination shows how close the results are to the measured data;  a  perfect  match
       results in R^2 = 1.0 and this will drop towards zero as the accuracy drops. Power-calibrate will annotate
       R^2 to provide some hint on how strong the relationship between the raw data and the linear estimation of
       power consumption.

       An  estimate  of  the  power  used  per  bogo-op  is  estimated, that is, the power consumed to perform 1
       computation of a random number using a 64 bit multiple-with-carry. This can be used a very naïve  compute
       benchmarking metric when comparing different processors or power configurations.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       power-calibrate -d 60 -s 5 -n 0,1 -r 200 -p
              Measure  Watts  per 1% CPU (and bogo compute ops per Watt) with a 60 second warm-up delay per test
              round, 5 tests in the CPU load level (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) on CPUs 0 and 1 with a  200  second
              run time per test round while showing progress.

       power-calibrate -n 0,2,1,3
              Measure Watts per 1% CPU (and bogo compute oper per Watt) on 4 CPUs. 4 rounds of tests will be run
              for each CPU load interval, measuring:
                                                1 CPU:    CPU 0
                                                2 CPUs:   CPUs 0,2
                                                3 CPUs:   CPUs 0,2,1
                                                4 CPUs:   CPUs 0,2,1,3

       power-calibrate  -R -r 10 -d 5 -s 21 -n 0 -p
              Measure per-CPU package Watts consumed using the Intel RAPL interface. This example has a 5 second
              warm-up  delay per test round, 21 tests in the CPU load level (0%, 5%, 10%, .., 95%, 100%) on CPUs
              0 with a 10 second run time per test round while showing progress.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Power-calibrate attempts to find a linear relationship between power consumed and the CPU  loading,  bogo
       operations per second and the context switching.  This is not necessarily the case for all processors. If
       the  R^2  coefficient  of determination is not close to 1.0 then this indicates there may not be a linear
       relationship.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Power-calibrate relies on the battery interface to provide timely stats on battery power consumption  and
       this  will  vary  from  device to device.  Software or firmware may adjust the battery readings from gas-
       gauges and even re-calibrate the values during battery drain hence skewing the final results from  power-
       calibrate.   Batteries also show a non-linear discharge characteristic, so running power-calibrate on low
       battery charge is not advised.

       Processors with hyperthreading or non-uniform processing performance will skew the bogo-ops  calculations
       since different logical CPUs will vary in processing throughput.

       In  general,  the  more  samples  gathered,  the  more  accurate  the final results will be, however, the
       calibration will take longer to run.  With more samples, the tendency to get a few random outliers in the
       samples may increase, and that may affect the final R^2 coefficient of determination.

       Power-calibrate is a power estimation tool, so results will vary between different runs.  It is not meant
       to be an accurate substitute for power measurements using a high precision multimeter.
