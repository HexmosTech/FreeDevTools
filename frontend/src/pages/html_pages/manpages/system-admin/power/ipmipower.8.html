</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ipmipower - IPMI power control utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ipmipower</b> [<u>OPTION</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Ipmipower</b>  allows users to remotely power on, off, cycle, hard reset, get a power status query, perform a
       pulse diagnostic interrupt, or initiate a soft-shutdown of the OS via ACPI  through  the  IPMI  over  LAN
       protocol.

       When  a  power  command  (<b>--on</b>,  <b>--off</b>, <b>--cycle</b>, <b>--reset</b>, <b>--stat</b>, <b>--pulse</b>, or <b>--soft</b>) is specified on the
       command line, <b>Ipmipower</b> will attempt to run the power command on all hostnames listed on the command line
       then exit.

       If no power commands are specified  on  the  command  line,  <b>ipmipower</b>  will  run  in  interactive  mode.
       Interactive  mode  gives  the  user  a  command  line interface to enter various commands. Details of the
       interactive command line interface can be found below under INTERACTIVE COMMANDS.

       Listed below are general IPMI options, tool specific options, trouble  shooting  information,  workaround
       information, examples, and known issues. For a general introduction to FreeIPMI please see <b><a href="../man7/freeipmi.7.html">freeipmi</a>(7).</b>

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  options are general options for configuring IPMI communication and executing general tool
       commands.

       <b>-D</b> <u>IPMIDRIVER</u>, <b>--driver-type</b>=<u>IPMIDRIVER</u>
              Specify the driver type to use instead of  doing  an  auto  selection.   The  currently  available
              outofband drivers are LAN and LAN_2_0, which perform IPMI 1.5 and IPMI 2.0 respectively.

       <b>-h</b> <u>IPMIHOST1,IPMIHOST2,...</u>, <b>--hostname</b>=<u>IPMIHOST1[:PORT],IPMIHOST2[:PORT],...</u>
              Specify  the  remote  host(s) to communicate with. Multiple hostnames may be separated by comma or
              may be specified in a range format;  see  HOSTRANGED  SUPPORT  below.  An  optional  port  can  be
              specified  with  each  host,  which  may  be  useful in port forwarding or similar situations.  If
              specifying an IPv6 address and port, use the format [ADDRESS]:PORT.

       <b>-u</b> <u>USERNAME</u>, <b>--username</b>=<u>USERNAME</u>
              Specify the username to use when authenticating with the remote host.  If not  specified,  a  null
              (i.e.  anonymous)  username  is assumed. The user must have atleast OPERATOR privileges to run the
              --on, --off, --reset, --cycle, --pulse, or --soft power  control  commands.  The  user  must  have
              atleast USER privileges to determine the power status of the machine through --stat.

       <b>-p</b> <u>PASSWORD</u>, <b>--password</b>=<u>PASSWORD</u>
              Specify  the  password to use when authenticationg with the remote host.  If not specified, a null
              password is assumed. Maximum password length is 16 for IPMI 1.5 and 20 for IPMI 2.0.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--password-prompt</b>
              Prompt for password to avoid possibility of listing it in process lists.

       <b>-k</b> <u>K_G</u>, <b>--k-g</b>=<u>K_G</u>
              Specify the K_g BMC key to use when authenticating with the remote  host  for  IPMI  2.0.  If  not
              specified,  a  null  key  is assumed. To input the key in hexadecimal form, prefix the string with
              '0x'. E.g., the key 'abc' can be entered with the either the string 'abc' or the string '0x616263'

       <b>-K</b>, <b>--k-g-prompt</b>
              Prompt for k-g to avoid possibility of listing it in process lists.

       <b>--session-timeout</b>=<u>MILLISECONDS</u>
              Specify the session timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 20000 milliseconds (20  seconds)  if  not
              specified.

       <b>--retransmission-timeout</b>=<u>MILLISECONDS</u>
              Specify  the  packet  retransmission  timeout  in  milliseconds. Defaults to 400 milliseconds (0.4
              seconds) if not specified.

       <b>-a</b> <u>AUTHENTICATION-TYPE</u>, <b>--authentication-type</b>=<u>AUTHENTICATION-TYPE</u>
              Specify the IPMI 1.5 authentication type to use. The currently available authentication types  are
              NONE, STRAIGHT_PASSWORD_KEY, MD2, and MD5. Defaults to MD5 if not specified.

       <b>-I</b> <u>CIPHER-SUITE-ID</u>, <b>--cipher-suite-id</b>=<u>CIPHER-SUITE-ID</u>
              Specify  the  IPMI  2.0  cipher  suite  ID  to  use.  The  Cipher  Suite  ID  identifies  a set of
              authentication, integrity, and confidentiality algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0  communication.  The
              authentication  algorithm  identifies  the  algorithm  to  use  for  session  setup, the integrity
              algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for session packet signatures, and  the  confidentiality
              algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher suite ID 3 if
              not specified. The following cipher suite ids are currently supported:

              0 - Authentication Algorithm = None; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None

              1  - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm =
              None

              2 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1;  Integrity  Algorithm  =  HMAC-SHA1-96;  Confidentiality
              Algorithm = None

              3  -  Authentication  Algorithm  =  HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality

              None

              7  -  Authentication  Algorithm  =  HMAC-MD5;  Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality
              Algorithm = None

              8 - Authentication Algorithm =  HMAC-MD5;  Integrity  Algorithm  =  HMAC-MD5-128;  Confidentiality
              Algorithm = AES-CBC-128

              11 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm
              = None

              12 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm
              = AES-CBC-128

              15 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA256; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm
              = None

              16   -   Authentication   Algorithm   =   HMAC-SHA256;   Integrity  Algorithm  =  HMAC_SHA256_128;
              Confidentiality Algorithm = None

              17  -  Authentication  Algorithm   =   HMAC-SHA256;   Integrity   Algorithm   =   HMAC_SHA256_128;
              Confidentiality Algorithm = AES-CBC-128

       <b>-l</b> <u>PRIVILEGE-LEVEL</u>, <b>--privilege-level</b>=<u>PRIVILEGE-LEVEL</u>
              Specify  the  privilege  level  to  be  used.  The  currently available privilege levels are USER,
              OPERATOR, and ADMIN. Defaults to OPERATOR if not specified.

       <b>--config-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Specify an alternate configuration file.

       <b>-W</b> <u>WORKAROUNDS</u>, <b>--workaround-flags</b>=<u>WORKAROUNDS</u>
              Specify workarounds to vendor compliance issues. Multiple workarounds can be  specified  separated
              by  commas. A special command line flag of "none", will indicate no workarounds (may be useful for
              overriding configured defaults). See WORKAROUNDS below for a list of available workarounds.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Turn on debugging.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Output a help list and exit.

       <b>--usage</b>
              Output a usage message and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Output the program version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>IPMIPOWER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are specific to <b>ipmipower.</b>

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--on</b>
              Power on the target hosts.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--off</b>
              Power off the target hosts.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--cycle</b>
              Power cycle the target hosts.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--reset</b>
              Reset the target hosts.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--stat</b>
              Get power status of the target hosts.

       <b>--pulse</b>
              Send power diagnostic interrupt to target hosts.

       <b>--soft</b> Initiate a soft-shutdown of the OS via ACPI.

       <b>--on-if-off</b>
              The IPMI specification does not require the power cycle or  hard  reset  commands  to  turn  on  a
              machine  that  is  currently  powered  off.  This  option will force <b>ipmipower</b> to issue a power on
              command instead of a power cycle or hard reset command if the remote machine's power is  currently
              off.

       <b>--wait-until-on</b>
              The  IPMI  specification  allows power on commands to return prior to the power on actually taking
              place. This option will force <b>ipmipower</b> to regularly query the remote BMC and  return  only  after
              the machine has powered on.

       <b>--wait-until-off</b>
              The  IPMI  specification  allows  power off commands to return prior the power off actually taking
              place. This option will force <b>ipmipower</b> to regularly query the remote BMC and  return  only  after
              the machine has powered off.

       <b>--oem-power-type</b>=<u>OEM-POWER-TYPE</u>
              This  option informs <b>ipmipower</b> to initiate power control operations via an IPMI OEM specific power
              control extension. The currently available POWERTYPEs are <u>NONE</u> and <u>C410X</u>.  Please  see  OEM  POWER
              EXTENSIONS below for additional information.

</pre><h4><b>IPMIPOWER</b> <b>ADVANCED</b> <b>NETWORK</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are used to change the networking behavior of <b>ipmipower.</b>

       <b>--retransmission-wait-timeout</b>=<u>MILLISECONDS</u>
              Specify the retransmission wait timeout length in milliseconds. The retransmission wait timeout is
              similar  to  the  retransmission  timeout  above,  but  is  used specifically for power completion
              verification with the <b>--wait-until-on</b> and <b>--wait-until-off</b> options.  Defaults to 500  milliseconds
              (0.5 seconds).

       <b>--retransmission-backoff-count</b>=<u>COUNT</u>
              Specify  the  retransmission  backoff count for retransmissions. After ever COUNT retransmissions,
              the retransmission timeout length will be increased by another factor. Defaults to 8.

       <b>--ping-interval</b>=<u>MILLISECONDS</u>
              Specify the ping interval length in milliseconds. When running in interactive mode,  RMCP  (Remote
              Management  Control Protocol) discovery messages will be sent to all configured remote hosts every
              MILLISECONDS to confirm their support of IPMI. Power commands cannot be sent to a host until it is
              discovered (or re-discovered if previously lost). Defaults to 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).  Ping
              discovery  messages  can  be disabled by setting this value to 0. RMCP ping discovery messages are
              automatically disabled in non-interactive mode.

       <b>--ping-timeout</b>=<u>MILLISECONDS</u>
              Specify the ping timeout length in milliseconds. When running in interactive  mode,  RMCP  (Remote
              Management  Control  Protocol)  messages  discovery will be sent to all configured remote hosts to
              confirm their support of IPMI. A remote host is considered  undiscovered  if  the  host  does  not
              respond in MILLISECONDS time. Defaults to 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds). The ping timeout cannot
              be larger than the ping interval.

       <b>--ping-packet-count</b>=<u>COUNT</u>
              Specify  the  ping  packet  count size. Defaults to 10. See the <b>--ping-percent-fR</b> <b>option</b> <b>below</b> <b>for</b>
              <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>option.</b>

       <b>--ping-percent</b>=<u>PERCENT</u>
              Specify the ping percent value. Defaults to 50.  Since IPMI is based on UDP, it is  difficult  for
              <b>ipmipower</b>  to  distinguish  between  a  missing  machine  and  a  bad  (or heavily loaded) network
              connection in interactive mode. when running in interactive mode.  For  example,  suppose  a  link
              consistently  drops  80%  of  the packets to a particular machine. The power control operation may
              have difficulty completing, although a recent pong response from RMCP makes <b>ipmipower</b> believe  the
              machine  is  up  and  functioning properly.  The ping packet count and percent options are used to
              alleviate this problem.  <b>Ipmipower</b> will monitor RMCP ping  packets  in  packet  count  chunks.  If
              <b>ipmipower</b>  does  not  receive  a response to greater than ping percent of those packets, <b>ipmipower</b>
              will assume the link to this node is bad and will not send power control operations to  that  node
              until  the  connection  is  determined  to  be reliable. This heuristic can be disabled by setting
              either the ping packet count or ping percent to 0. This feature is not used if  ping  interval  is
              set to 0.

       <b>--ping-consec-count</b>=<u>COUNT</u>
              Specify  the  ping consecutive count. This is another heuristic used to determine if a node should
              be considered discovered, undiscovered, or with a bad connection. If a valid  RMCP  pong  response
              was  received for the last COUNT ping packets, a node will be considered discovered, regardless of
              other heuristics listed above. Defaults to 5. This heuristic can be disabled by setting this value
              to 0. This feature is not used if other ping features described above are disabled.

</pre><h4><b>HOSTRANGED</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following  options  manipulate  hostranged  output.  See  HOSTRANGED  SUPPORT  below  for  additional
       information on hostranges.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--buffer-output</b>
              Buffer  hostranged  output. For each node, buffer standard output until the node has completed its
              IPMI operation. When specifying this option, data may appear to output slower to  the  user  since
              the the entire IPMI operation must complete before any data can be output.  See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT
              below for additional information.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--consolidate-output</b>
              Consolidate  hostranged  output.  The  complete  standard output from every node specified will be
              consolidated so that nodes with identical output are not output twice. A header  will  list  those
              nodes with the consolidated output. When this option is specified, no output can be seen until the
              IPMI  operations  to  all  nodes  has  completed. If the user breaks out of the program early, all
              currently consolidated output  will  be  dumped.  See  HOSTRANGED  SUPPORT  below  for  additional
              information.

       <b>-F</b> <u>NUM</u>, <b>--fanout</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              Specify multiple host fanout. Indicates the maximum number of power control operations that can be
              executed in parallel.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--eliminate</b>
              Eliminate  hosts determined as undetected by <b>ipmidetect.</b>  This attempts to remove the common issue
              of hostranged execution timing out due to several nodes being removed  from  service  in  a  large
              cluster. The <b>ipmidetectd</b> daemon must be running on the node executing the command.

       <b>--always-prefix</b>
              Always  prefix output, even if only one host is specified or communicating in-band. This option is
              primarily useful for scripting purposes. Option will be ignored if specified with the <b>-C</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Ipmipower</b> provides the following interactive  commands  at  the  ipmipower&gt;  prompt.   Before  any  power
       commands  (on,  off,  cycle,  reset, stat, pulse, or soft) can be used, hostnames must be configured into

</pre><h4><b>OEM</b> <b>POWER</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Some motherboards include IPMI OEM extensions for alternate power control mechanisms. For example,  these
       power  control  mechanisms  may allow you to power control a sub-device within the system rather than the
       entire system itself.

       By specifying an OEM power type via <b>--oem-power-type</b> on the command line  or  <b><a href="../man5/freeipmi.conf.5.html">freeipmi.conf</a>(5),</b>  you  can
       instruct  <b>ipmipower</b>  to execute alternate power control implementations over the standard ones. Depending
       on the OEM extension, some power control commands may  no  longer  be  available.  For  example,  an  OEM
       extension may allow <b>on</b> but not <b>cycle</b>. Specific <b>ipmipower</b> options may not longer function either.

       Some OEM extensions may require additional arguments for their power control action, such as a sub-device
       identifier. Additional arguments can be provided by appending a plus sign ('+') and the extra information
       to the end of the hostname. This can be done on the command line or in interactive mode. For example, the
       hostname  <u>mynode+18</u>  would indicate the power control operation should be sent to the host <u>mynode</u>, and <u>18</u>
       is the identifier of a possible sub-device to be power controlled.  The  <u>--consolidate-output</u>  option  is
       commonly disabled when using an OEM power control that requires extra arguments.

       Because  OEM power control may involve subtypes, it is possible a user may wish to power control multiple
       sub-devices on the same host. For example, you might specify the hosts <u>mynode+1,mynode+2</u>,  indicating  to
       power control subdevice 1 and 2 on <u>mynode</u>.  Because many BMCs cannot handle multiple IPMI sessions, power
       control operations to the same host will be serialized internally by <b>ipmipower.</b>

       The  following are the current OEM power types available, along with information on the systems they work
       with and the power control operations available.

       <b>C410X</b>  This OEM power type supports the power control of PCIe slots on Dell Poweredge C410x  systems.  It
              supports  <b>on</b>,  <b>off</b>,  and  <b>stat</b>. The PCIe slot number ranges from 1-16 and must always be specified
              when attempting to power control with this extension. For example,  the  hostname  <u>mynode+2</u>  would
              inform  <b>ipmipower</b>  to  operate  on  slot number <u>2</u> on <u>mynode</u>.  The C410x appears to have difficulty
              handling new slot power control requests until prior  ones  have  completed.  Users  may  wish  to
              strongly consider using the <b>--wait-until-on</b> and <b>--wait-until-off</b> options if multiple slots will be
              power controlled in short succession.

       <b>NONE</b>   This  informs  <b>ipmipower</b>  that  no  OEM power type extension is to be used and standard IPMI power
              control is used. This is the default.

</pre><h4><b>HOSTRANGED</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Multiple hosts can be input either as an explicit comma separated lists of hosts or a range of  hostnames
       in  the  general  form:  prefix[n-m,l-k,...],  where  n  &lt; m and l &lt; k, etc. The later form should not be
       confused with regular expression character classes (also denoted by []). For example,  foo[19]  does  not
       represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a degenerate range: foo19.

       This  range  syntax  is  meant  only  as  a convenience on clusters with a prefixNN naming convention and
       specification of ranges should not be considered necessary -- the list foo1,foo9 could  be  specified  as
       such, or by the range foo[1,9].

       Some examples of range usage follow:
           foo[01-05] instead of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05
           foo[7,9-10] instead of foo7,foo9,foo10
           foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3

       As  a  reminder  to  the  reader,  some  shells  will  interpret brackets ([ and ]) for pattern matching.
       Depending on your shell, it may be necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.

       When multiple hosts are specified by the user, a socket will be created for  each  host  and  polled  on,
       effectively  allowing  communication  to  all  hosts  in parallel. This will allow communication to large
       numbers of nodes far more quickly than if done in serial.  The <b>-F</b> option  can  configure  the  number  of
       nodes that can be communicated with in parallel at the same time.

       By  default,  standard output from each node specified will be output with the hostname prepended to each
       line. Although this output is readable in  many  situations,  it  may  be  difficult  to  read  in  other
       situations.  For  example, output from multiple nodes may be mixed together. The <b>-B</b> and <b>-C</b> options can be
       used to change this default.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Determine the power status of foo[0-2] with null username and password
               ipmipower -h foo[0-2] --stat

       Determine the power status of foo[0-2] with non-null username and password
               ipmipower -h foo[0-2] -u foo -p bar --stat

       Hard reset nodes foo[0-2] with non-null username and password
               ipmipower -h foo[0-2] -u foo -p bar --reset

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       Most often, IPMI problems are due to configuration problems.

       IPMI over LAN problems involve a misconfiguration of the remote machine's BMC.  Double check to make sure
       the following are configured properly in the remote machine's BMC: IP address, MAC address, subnet  mask,
       username,  user  enablement,  user  privilege,  password,  LAN  privilege,  LAN  enablement,  and allowed
       authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0 connections, double check to make sure the cipher suite privilege(s)
       and K_g key are configured properly. The <b><a href="../man8/ipmi-config.8.html">ipmi-config</a>(8)</b> tool can be used to  check  and/or  change  these
       configuration settings.

       In  addition  to  the  troubleshooting  tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below to also if there are any
       vendor specific bugs that have been discovered and worked around.

       Listed below are many of the common issues for error messages.  For additional support, please e-mail the
       &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt; mailing list.

       "username invalid" - The username entered (or a NULL username if none was entered) is  not  available  on
       the remote machine. It may also be possible the remote BMC's username configuration is incorrect.

       "password invalid" - The password entered (or a NULL password if none was entered) is not correct. It may
       also be possible the password for the user is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "password  verification  timeout"  -  Password  verification  has  timed out.  A "password invalid" error
       (described above) or a generic "session timeout" (described below) occurred.  During this  point  in  the
       protocol it cannot be differentiated which occurred.

       "k_g  invalid"  - The K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was entered) is not correct. It may also
       be possible the K_g key is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "privilege level insufficient" -  An  IPMI  command  requires  a  higher  user  privilege  than  the  one
       authenticated  with.  Please try to authenticate with a higher privilege. This may require authenticating
       to a different user which has a higher maximum privilege.

       "privilege level cannot be obtained  for  this  user"  -  The  privilege  level  you  are  attempting  to
       authenticate  with  is  higher  than  the  maximum  allowed  for this user. Please try again with a lower
       privilege. It may also be possible the maximum privilege level allowed  for  a  user  is  not  configured
       properly on the remote BMC.

       "authentication  type  unavailable  for  attempted privilege level" - The authentication type you wish to
       authenticate with is not available  for  this  privilege  level.  Please  try  again  with  an  alternate
       authentication  type  or  alternate privilege level. It may also be possible the available authentication
       types you can authenticate with are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "cipher suite id unavailable" - The cipher suite id you wish to authenticate with is not available on the
       remote BMC. Please try again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may also  be  possible  the  available
       cipher suite ids are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "ipmi  2.0  unavailable"  - IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote machine. Please try to use IPMI 1.5
       instead.

       "connection timeout" - Initial IPMI communication failed. A number  of  potential  errors  are  possible,
       including  an  invalid  hostname specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be resolved, IPMI is not enabled on
       the remote server, the network connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration and connectivity.

       "session timeout" - The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect.  If this error  occurs  often,  you
       may wish to increase the retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are considerably slower than others.

       "internal  IPMI  error" - An IPMI error has occurred that FreeIPMI does not know how to handle. Please e-
       mail &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt; to report the issue.

</pre><h4><b>IPMIPOWER</b> <b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       When powering on a powered off machine, the client must have a means by which to resolve the MAC  address
       of  the  remote  machine's ethernet card. While most modern IPMI solutions support the ability to ARP and
       resolve addresses when the machine is powered off, some older machines do not. This is  typically  solved
       in one of two ways:

       1) Enable gratuitous ARPs on the remote machine. The remote machine will send out a gratuitous ARP, which
       advertises  the  ethernet IP and MAC address so that other machines on the network this information their
       local ARP cache. For large clusters, this method is not recommended since gratuitous ARPs can  flood  the
       network with unnecessary traffic.

       2)  Permanently  store  the  remote machine's MAC address in the local ARP cache. This is the more common
       approach on large clusters.

       Other methods are listed in the IPMI specification.

</pre><h4><b>WORKAROUNDS</b></h4><pre>
       With so many different vendors implementing their own IPMI solutions,  different  vendors  may  implement
       their  IPMI protocols incorrectly. The following describes a number of workarounds currently available to
       handle discovered compliance issues. When possible, workarounds have been implemented  so  they  will  be
       transparent  to  the user. However, some will require the user to specify a workaround be used via the -W
       option.

       The hardware listed below may only indicate the hardware that a problem was discovered on. Newer versions
       of hardware may fix the problems indicated below. Similar machines from vendors may or  may  not  exhibit
       the same problems. Different vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI firmware developer, so
       it may be worthwhile to try workarounds listed below even if your motherboard is not listed.

       If  you  believe  your  hardware  has  an  additional  compliance  issue  that  needs  a workaround to be
       implemented,   please   contact    the    FreeIPMI    maintainers    on    &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt;    or
       &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-devel@gnu.org">freeipmi-devel@gnu.org</a>&gt;.

       <u>authcap</u>  -  This  workaround  flag  will  skip  early  checks  for  username capabilities, authentication
       capabilities, and K_g support and allow IPMI authentication to succeed. It works around  multiple  issues
       in  which  the remote system does not properly report username capabilities, authentication capabilities,
       or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may see "username invalid", "authentication type unavailable  for
       attempted  privilege  level",  or "k_g invalid" errors.  Issue observed on Asus P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4,
       Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.

       <u>nochecksumcheck</u> - This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the checksums returned  from  IPMI
       command  responses.  It  works around systems that return invalid checksums due to implementation errors,
       but the packet is otherwise valid. Users are  cautioned  on  the  use  of  this  option,  as  it  removes
       validation  of  packet  integrity in a number of circumstances. However, it is unlikely to be an issue in
       most situations. Those hitting this issue may see "connection timeout", "session timeout",  or  "password
       verification  timeout"  errors. On IPMI 1.5 connections, the "noauthcodecheck" workaround may also needed
       too. Issue observed on Supermicro X9SCM-iiF, Supermicro X9DRi-F, and Supermicro X9DRFR.

       <u>idzero</u> - This workaround flag will allow empty session IDs to be accepted by the client. It works  around
       IPMI  sessions  that  report  empty  session IDs to the client. Those hitting this issue may see "session
       timeout" errors. Issue observed on Tyan S2882 with M3289 BMC.

       <u>unexpectedauth</u> - This workaround flag will allow unexpected non-null authcodes to be  checked  as  though
       they  were expected. It works around an issue when packets contain non-null authentication data when they
       should be null due to disabled per-message authentication. Those hitting  this  issue  may  see  "session
       timeout" errors. Issue observed on Dell PowerEdge 2850,SC1425. Confirmed fixed on newer firmware.

       <u>forcepermsg</u>  -  This  workaround  flag will force per-message authentication to be used no matter what is
       advertised by the remote system. It works around an issue when per-message authentication  is  advertised
       as  disabled on the remote system, but it is actually required for the protocol. Those hitting this issue
       may see "session timeout" errors.  Issue observed on IBM eServer 325.

       <u>endianseq</u> - This workaround flag will flip the endian of  the  session  sequence  numbers  to  allow  the
       session  to  continue  properly.  It  works  around  IPMI 1.5 session sequence numbers that are the wrong
       endian.  Those hitting this issue may see "session timeout" errors.  Issue  observed  on  some  Sun  ILOM
       1.0/2.0 (depends on service processor endian).

       <u>noauthcodecheck</u>  - This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the authentication codes returned
       from IPMI 1.5 command responses. It works around systems that return invalid authentication codes due  to
       hashing  or  implementation  errors.  Users  are  cautioned  on  the use of this option, as it removes an
       authentication check verifying the validity of a packet. However, in most organizations, this is unlikely
       to be a security issue. Those hitting this issue may see  "connection  timeout",  "session  timeout",  or
       "password  verification  timeout"  errors.   Issue observed on Xyratex FB-H8-SRAY, Intel Windmill, Quanta
       Winterfell, and Wiwynn Windmill.

       <u>intel20</u> - This workaround flag will work around several Intel IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The  issues
       covered  include  padding  of usernames, and password truncation if the authentication algorithm is HMAC-
       MD5-128. Those hitting this issue may see  "username  invalid",  "password  invalid",  or  "k_g  invalid"
       errors. Issue observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module (Professional Edition).

       <u>supermicro20</u> - This workaround flag will work around several Supermicro IPMI 2.0 authentication issues on
       motherboards   w/   Peppercon   IPMI  firmware.  The  issues  covered  include  handling  invalid  length
       authentication codes. Those hitting this issue may see "password  invalid"  errors.   Issue  observed  on
       Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card. Confirmed fixed on newerver firmware.

       <u>sun20</u> - This workaround flag will work work around several Sun IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The issues
       covered  include  invalid  lengthed  hash keys, improperly hashed keys, and invalid cipher suite records.
       Those hitting this issue may see "password invalid" or "bmc error" errors.  Issue observed  on  Sun  Fire
       4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.  This workaround automatically includes the "opensesspriv" workaround.

       <u>opensesspriv</u>  -  This  workaround  flag  will  slightly  alter FreeIPMI's IPMI 2.0 connection protocol to
       workaround an invalid hashing algorithm used by the remote system. The privilege level  sent  during  the
       Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0 connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege level sent
       during  the  RAKP1  connection stage. Those hitting this issue may see "password invalid", "k_g invalid",
       "bad rmcpplus status code", or "privilege level cannot be obtained for this user" errors.  Issue observed
       on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Supermicro X8DTH,  Supermicro  X8DTG,
       Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN, Dell C5220,
       and the OpenIPMI software BMC. This workaround is automatically triggered with the "sun20" workaround.

       <u>integritycheckvalue</u>  -  This  workaround flag will work around an invalid integrity check value during an
       IPMI 2.0 session establishment when using Cipher Suite ID 0.  The  integrity  check  value  should  be  0
       length,  however the remote motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting this issue may see
       "k_g invalid" errors. Issue observed on Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU,  and  Intel  S5500WBV/Penguin
       Relion 700, and Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X.

       <u>ipmiping</u>  -  This  workaround option will inform <b>ipmipower</b> to use IPMI based ping packets instead of RMCP
       ping packets. Some motherboards have been observed to not implement RMCP ping/pong support despite  being
       required  by  the  IPMI  specification. Those hitting this issue may see "not discovered" errors in shell
       mode.  Issue observed on Intel M50FCP, Intel Windmill, Quanta Winterfell, and Wiwynn Windmill.

       No IPMI 1.5 Support - Some motherboards that support IPMI 2.0 have been found to not  support  IPMI  1.5.
       Those hitting this issue may see "ipmi 2.0 unavailable" or "connection timeout" errors. This issue can be
       worked  around  by using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by specifying <b>--driver-type</b>=<u>LAN_2_0</u>. Issue observed
       on a number of HP and Supermicro motherboards.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful execution, exit status is 0. On error, exit status is 1.

       If multiple hosts are specified for communication, the exit status is  0  if  and  only  if  all  targets
       successfully execute. Otherwise the exit status is 1.

       When operating in interactive mode, the exit value will be based on the last power operation executed.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       On older operating systems, if you input your username, password, and other potentially security relevant
       information  on the command line, this information may be discovered by other users when using tools like
       the <b><a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a>(1)</b> command or looking in the <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> file system. It is generally  more  secure  to  input  password
       information  with  options  like  the  -P or -K options. Configuring security relevant information in the
       FreeIPMI configuration file would also be an appropriate way to hide this information.

       In order to prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will temporarily "lock up" after a  number  of  remote
       authentication  errors.  You  may need to wait awhile in order to this temporary "lock up" to pass before
       you may authenticate again.

       IPMI specifications do not require  BMCs  to  perform  a  power  control  operation  before  returning  a
       completion  code  to  the caller.  Therefore, it is possible for <b>ipmipower</b> to return power status queries
       opposite of what you are expecting.  For example, if a "power off" operation  is  performed,  a  BMC  may
       return  a successful completion code to <b>ipmipower</b> before the "power off" operation is actually performed.
       Subsequent power status queries may return "on" for several seconds, until the BMC actually performs  the
       "power off" operation.
