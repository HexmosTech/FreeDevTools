       FQ - Fair Queue traffic policing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tc</b>  <b>qdisc</b>  <b>...</b>  <b>fq</b> [ <b>limit</b> PACKETS ] [ <b>flow_limit</b> PACKETS ] [ <b>quantum</b> BYTES ] [ <b>initial_quantum</b> BYTES ] [

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       FQ (Fair Queue) is a classless packet scheduler meant to be mostly used for  locally  generated  traffic.
       It  is  designed  to  achieve  per  flow  pacing.  FQ does flow separation, and is able to respect pacing
       requirements set by TCP stack.  All packets belonging to a socket are considered as a  'flow'.   For  non
       local packets (router workload), packet hash is used as fallback.

       An  application  can  specify  a  maximum pacing rate using the <b>SO_MAX_PACING_RATE</b> setsockopt call.  This
       packet scheduler adds delay between packets to respect rate limitation set  on  each  socket.  Note  that
       after  linux-4.20,  linux  adopted  EDT  (Earliest  Departure Time) and TCP directly sets the appropriate
       Departure Time for each skb.

       Dequeueing happens in a round-robin fashion.  A special FIFO queue is reserved for high priority  packets
       ( <b>TC_PRIO_CONTROL</b> priority), such packets are always dequeued first.

       FQ is non-work-conserving.

       TCP  pacing  is  good  for flows having idle times, as the congestion window permits TCP stack to queue a
       possibly large number of packets.  This removes the 'slow start after idle' choice, badly  hitting  large
       BDP flows and applications delivering chunks of data such as video streams.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>limit</b>
       Hard  limit  on the real queue size. When this limit is reached, new packets are dropped. If the value is
       lowered, packets are dropped so that the new limit is met. Default is 10000 packets.

   <b>flow_limit</b>
       Hard limit on the maximum number of packets queued per flow.  Default value is 100.

   <b>quantum</b>
       The credit per dequeue RR round, i.e. the amount of bytes a flow is allowed to dequeue at once. A  larger
       value  means  a  longer  time  period  before the next flow will be served.  Default is 2 * interface MTU
       bytes.

   <b>initial_quantum</b>
       The initial sending rate credit, i.e. the amount of bytes a new flow is  allowed  to  dequeue  initially.
       This  is specifically meant to allow using IW10 without added delay.  Default is 10 * interface MTU, i.e.
       15140 for 'standard' ethernet.

   <b>maxrate</b>
       Maximum  sending  rate  of  a  flow.   Default  is   unlimited.    Application   specific   setting   via
       <b>SO_MAX_PACING_RATE</b> is ignored only if it is larger than this value.

   <b>buckets</b>
       The  size of the hash table used for flow lookups. Each bucket is assigned a red-black tree for efficient
       collision sorting.  Default: 1024.

   <b>orphan_mask</b>
       For packets not owned by a socket, fq is able to mask a part of skb-&gt;hash and reduce  number  of  buckets
       associated  with  the  traffic.  This is a DDOS prevention mechanism, and the default is 1023 (meaning no
       more than 1024 flows are allocated for these packets)

   <b>[no]pacing</b>
       Enable or disable flow pacing. Default is enabled.

   <b>ce_threshold</b>
       sets a threshold above which all packets are marked with ECN Congestion Experienced. This is  useful  for
       DCTCP-style congestion control algorithms that require marking at very shallow queueing thresholds.
