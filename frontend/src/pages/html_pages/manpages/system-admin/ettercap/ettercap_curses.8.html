</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ettercap - Man page for the Ncurses GUI.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The curses GUI is quite simple and intuitive.
       It  is  menu-driven.  Every  flag  or  function  can  be modified/called through the upper menu. All user
       messages are printed in the bottom window. If you want to see the old messages, you can scroll the window
       buffer by pressing the UP, DOWN, PPAGE, NPAGE keys.  The middle part is used to  display  information  or
       dialogs for the user.

       The  menus  can be opened by pressing the relative hotkey. For the menus the hotkey is represented by the
       uppercase initial letter of the title (e.g. 'S' for Sniffing, 'T' for Targets). The  functions  within  a
       menu  can be called by pressing the hotkey depicted near the function name on the right. Hotkeys prefixed
       with 'C-' are to be used in conjunction with the CTRL key (e.g. 'C-f' means CTRL+f).

       You can switch the focus between the objects on the screen by pressing the TAB key or by clicking  on  it
       with the mouse (if you are running ettercap within an xterm). Mouse events are supported only through the
       xterm.  You can use the mouse to select objects, open a menu, choose a function, scroll the elevators for
       the scrolling windows, etc etc.

       When you open multiple windows in the middle part, they will overlap. Use the TAB key to  switch  between
       them. Use CTRL+Q to close the focused window.
       You  can  also  use CTRL+Q to close the input dialog if you want to cancel the requested input. (i.e. you
       have selected the wrong function and you want to go back).

       To have a quick help on the shortcuts you can use against a particular window press the SPACE key. A help
       window will be displayed with a list of shortcuts that can be used. If the window  does  not  appear,  no
       shortcuts are available.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>SELECT</b> <b>IT</b></h4><pre>
       To use the ncurses GUI you have to:

       - compile ettercap with ncurses support (obviously)
       - run it with the -C flag

       Passing  the  -C  flag is sufficient, but if you want you can pass other flags that will be automatically
       set for the ncurses GUI. You will be able to override them using the menu to change the options.

</pre><h4><b>ONCE</b> <b>STARTED</b></h4><pre>
       As soon as ettercap is launched with the Ncurses GUI, you will be prompted  with  multiple  choices.  The
       first  screen  lets  you select if you want to open a pcap file or dump the sniffed traffic to a file, if
       you want unified sniffing or bridged one, permits you to set a pcap file  on  the  captured  traffic  and
       enables you to log all the sniffed data.

       Once  you  have  selected  a  sniffing  method  (from  file,  unified or bridged) this screen will not be
       reachable anymore. The only way is to restart ettercap.

       Let's analyze each menu in the start screen:

       <b>File</b>

              <b>Open...</b>
                     Open a pcap file and analyze it. All the functionalities available for live sniffing are in
                     place except for those sending or forwarding packets (mitm attacks and so on...).

              <b>Dump</b> <b>to</b> <b>file...</b>
                     All the traffic sniffed by the live capture will be dumped to that file. The  filters,  not
                     the targets, have effects on this file, as all the packets received by pcap will be dumped.
                     The only way to not dump a certain packet is to set a proper pcap filter (see below).

              <b>Exit</b>
                     Exits from ettercap and returns to the command prompt.

       <b>Sniff</b>

              <b>Unified</b> <b>sniffing...</b>
                     Choosing  this function you will be prompted to select the network interface to be used for
                     sniffing. The first up and running interface  is  suggested  in  the  input  box.   For  an
                     explanation of what unified sniffing is, refer to <a href="../man8/ettercap.8.html">ettercap</a>(8).
                     TIP:  if  you  use  the  'u' hotkey, this step will be skipped and the default interface is
                     automatically selected.

              <b>Bridged</b> <b>sniffing...</b>
                     After selecting the two interfaces to be used, you will enter the  Bridged  sniffing  mode.
                     For an explanation of what bridged sniffing is, refer to <a href="../man8/ettercap.8.html">ettercap</a>(8).

              <b>Set</b> <b>pcap</b> <b>filter...</b>
                     Here you can insert a tcpdump-like filter for the capturing process.
                     IMPORTANT:  if  you  manage  to use a mitm attack, remember that if ettercap does not see a
                     packet, it will NOT be forwarded. So be sure of what  you  are  doing  by  setting  a  pcap
                     filter.

       <b>Options</b>

              <b>Unoffensive</b>
                     This  enable/disable  the unoffensive flag. The asterisk '*' means "the option is enabled".
                     Otherwise the option is not enabled.

              <b>Promisc</b> <b>mode</b>
                     Enable/disable the promisc mode for the live capture on a network interface.   This  is  an
                     "asterisk-option" as the unoffensive one.

              <b>Set</b> <b>netmask</b>
                     Use the specified netmask instead of the one associated with the current iface. This option
                     is  useful  if  you have the NIC with an associated netmask of class B and you want to scan
                     (with the arp scan) only a C class.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>INTERESTING</b> <b>PART</b></h4><pre>
       Once you have selected an offline sniffing or a live capture, the upper menu  is  modified  and  you  can
       start to do the interesting things...
       Some of the following menu are only available in live capture.

       <b>Start</b>

              <b>Start</b> <b>sniffing</b>
                     Starts  the  sniffing  process depending on what you have selected on startup (live or from
                     file)

              <b>Stop</b> <b>sniffing</b>
                     Stops the sniffing thread.

              <b>Exit</b>
                     Returns to your favourite shell ;)

       <b>Targets</b>

              <b>Current</b> <b>Targets</b>
                     Displays a list of hosts in each TARGET. You can selectively remove a host by selecting  it
                     and  press  'd'  or  add  a new host pressing 'a'. To switch between the two lists, use the
                     ARROWS keys.

              <b>Select</b> <b>TARGET(s)</b>
                     Lets you select the TARGET(s) as explained in <a href="../man8/ettercap.8.html">ettercap</a>(8). The syntax is the  same  as  for
                     the command line specification.

              <b>Protocol...</b>
                     You can choose to sniff only TCP, only UDP or both (ALL).

              <b>Reverse</b> <b>matching</b>
                     Reverse  the  matching  of  a  packet.  It  is  equivalent  to  a  NOT  before  the  target
                     specification.

              <b>Wipe</b> <b>Targets</b>
                     Restores both TARGETS to ANY/ANY/ANY

       <b>Hosts</b>

              <b>Hosts</b> <b>list</b>
                     Displays the list of hosts detected through an ARP  scan  or  converted  from  the  passive
                     profiles. This list is used by MITM attacks when the ANY target is selected, so if you want
                     to exclude a host from the attack, simply delete it from the list.
                     You  can  remove a host from the list by pressing 'd', add it to TARGET1 by pressing '1' or
                     add it to TARGET2 by pressing '2'.

              <b>Scan</b> <b>for</b> <b>hosts</b>
                     Perform the ARP scan of the netmask if no TARGETS are selected. If TARGETS was specified it
                     only scans for those hosts.

              <b>Load</b> <b>from</b> <b>file...</b>
                     Loads the hosts list from a file previously saved with "save to file" or hand crafted.

              <b>Save</b> <b>to</b> <b>file...</b>
                     Save the current hosts list to a file.

       <b>View</b>

              <b>Connections</b>
                     Displays the connection list. To see detailed information about a connection press 'd',  or
                     press  'k'  to  kill  it. To see the traffic for a specific connection, select it and press
                     enter. Once the two-panel interface is displayed you can move  the  focus  with  the  arrow
                     keys.  Press  'j'  to  switch between joined and split visualization. Press 'k' to kill the
                     connection. Press 'y' to inject interactively and 'Y' to inject a file.  Note  that  it  is
                     important which panel has the focus as the injected data will be sent to that address.
                     HINT: connections marked with an asterisk contain account(s) information.

              <b>Profiles</b>
                     Displays the passive profile hosts list. Selecting a host will display the relative details
                     (including account with user and pass for that host).
                     You  can  convert  the  passive profile list into the hosts list by pressing 'c'.  To purge
                     remote hosts, press 'l'. To purge local hosts, press 'r'. You can  also  dump  the  current
                     profile to a file by pressing 'd'; the dumped file can be opened with <a href="../man8/etterlog.8.html">etterlog</a>(8).
                     HINT: profiles marked with an asterisk contain account(s) information.

              <b>Statistics</b>
                     Displays some statistics about the sniffing process.

              <b>Resolve</b> <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b>
                     Enables  DNS  resolution  for all the sniffed IP address. CAUTION: this will extremely slow
                     down ettercap. By the way the passive dns  resolution  is  always  active.  It  sniffs  dns
                     replies  and  stores them in a cache. If an ip address is present in that cache, it will be
                     automatically resolved. It is dns resolution for free... ;)

              <b>Visualization</b> <b>method</b>
                     Change the visualization method for  the  sniffed  data.  Available  methods:  ascii,  hex,
                     ebcdic, text, html.

              <b>Visualization</b> <b>regex</b>
                     Set  the  visualization  regular  expression.  Only  packets  matching  this  regex will be
                     displayed in the connection data window.

              <b>Set</b> <b>the</b> <b>WiFi</b> <b>key</b>
                     Set the WiFi key used to decrypt WiFi encrypted packets. See <a href="../man8/ettercap.8.html">ettercap</a>(8) for the format  of
                     the key.

       <b>Mitm</b>

              <b>[...]</b>  For  each  type of attack, a menu entry is displayed. Simply select the attack you want and
                     fill the arguments when asked. You can activate more than one attack at a time.

              <b>Stop</b> <b>mitm</b> <b>attack(s)</b>
                     Stops all the mitm attacks currently active.

       <b>Filters</b>

              <b>Load</b> <b>a</b> <b>filter...</b>
                     Load a precompiled filter file. The file must be compiled with <a href="../man8/etterfilter.8.html">etterfilter</a>(8) before it can
                     be loaded.

              <b>Stop</b> <b>filtering</b>
                     Unload the filter and stop filtering the connections.

       <b>Logging</b>

              <b>Log</b> <b>all</b> <b>packets</b> <b>and</b> <b>infos...</b>
                     Given a file name, it will create two files: filename.eci (for information about hosts) and
                     filename.ecp (for all the interesting packets). This is the same as the -L option.

              <b>Log</b> <b>only</b> <b>infos...</b>
                     This is used only to sniff information about hosts (same as the -l option).

              <b>Stop</b> <b>logging</b> <b>info</b>
                     Come on... it is self explanatory.

              <b>Log</b> <b>user</b> <b>messages...</b>
                     Will log all the messages appearing in the bottom window (same as -m option).

              <b>Compressed</b> <b>file</b>
                     Asterisk-option to control whether or not the logfile should be compressed.

       <b>Plugins</b>

              <b>Manage</b> <b>the</b> <b>plugins</b>
                     Opens the plugin management window. You can select a plugin and  activate  it  by  pressing
                     'enter'.  Plugins already active can be recognized by the [1] symbol instead of [0]. If you
                     select an active plugin, it will be deactivated.

              <b>Load</b> <b>a</b> <b>plugin...</b>
                     You can load a plugin file that is not in the default search path. (remember that  you  can
                     browse directories with EC_UID permissions).
