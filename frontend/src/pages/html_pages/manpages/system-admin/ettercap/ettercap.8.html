       ettercap - multipurpose sniffer/content filter for man in the middle attacks

</pre><h4><b>*****</b> <b>IMPORTANT</b> <b>NOTE</b> <b>******</b></h4><pre>
       Since  ettercap NG (formerly 0.7.0), all the options have been changed. Even the target specification has
       been changed. <u>Please</u> <u>read</u> <u>carefully</u> <u>this</u> <u>man</u> <u>page.</u>

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ettercap</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] [<u>TARGET1</u>] [<u>TARGET2</u>]

       <b>If</b> <b>IPv6</b> <b>is</b> <b>enabled:</b>
       <u>TARGET</u> is in the form <u>MAC/IPs/IPv6/PORTs</u>
       <b>Otherwise,</b>
       <u>TARGET</u> is in the form <u>MAC/IPs/PORTs</u>
       where IPs and PORTs can be ranges (e.g. /192.168.0.1-30,40,50/20,22,25)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Ettercap was born as a sniffer for switched LAN (and  obviously  even  "hubbed"  ones),  but  during  the
       development  process it has gained more and more features that have changed it to a powerful and flexible
       tool for man-in-the-middle attacks.  It supports active and passive dissection of  many  protocols  (even
       ciphered ones) and includes many features for network and host analysis (such as OS fingerprint).

       It has two main sniffing options:

       <u>UNIFIED</u>,  this  method  sniffs  all  the packets that pass on the cable. You can choose to put or not the
       interface in promisc mode (-p option). The packet not directed to  the  host  running  ettercap  will  be
       forwarded  automatically  using  layer  3 routing. So you can use a mitm attack launched from a different
       tool and let ettercap modify the packets and forward them for you.
       The kernel ip_forwarding is always disabled by ettercap. This is done to prevent a forward  of  a  packet
       twice  (one  by  ettercap  and  one  by  the  kernel).   This is an invasive behaviour on gateways. So we
       recommend you to use ettercap on the gateways ONLY with the  UNOFFENSIVE  MODE  ENABLED.  Since  ettercap
       listens  only  on  one  network  interface,  launching it on the gateway in offensive mode will not allow
       packets to be rerouted back from the second interface.

       <u>BRIDGED</u>, it uses two network interfaces and forward the traffic from one to the  other  while  performing
       sniffing  and  content  filtering. This sniffing method is totally stealthy since there is no way to find
       that someone is in the middle on the cable.  You can look at this method as a mitm attack at layer 1. You
       will be in the middle of the cable between two entities. Don't use it on gateways or  it  will  transform
       your  gateway  into  a bridge. HINT: you can use the content filtering engine to drop packets that should
       not pass. This way ettercap will work as an inline IPS ;)

       You can also perform man in the middle attacks while using the unified sniffing. You can choose the  mitm
       attack that you prefer. The mitm attack module is independent from the sniffing and filtering process, so
       you can launch several attacks at the same time or use your own tool for the attack. The crucial point is
       that the packets have to arrive to ettercap with the correct mac address and a different ip address (only
       these packets will be forwarded).

       The most relevant ettercap features are:

       <b>SSH1</b>  <b>support</b>  <b>:</b>  you  can  sniff User and Pass, and even the data of an SSH1 connection. ettercap is the
       first software capable to sniff an SSH connection in FULL-DUPLEX

       <b>SSL</b> <b>support</b> <b>:</b> you can sniff SSL secured data... a fake certificate is presented to  the  client  and  the
       session is decrypted.

       <b>Characters</b>  <b>injection</b>  <b>in</b>  <b>an</b> <b>established</b> <b>connection</b> <b>:</b> you can inject characters to the server (emulating
       commands) or to the client (emulating replies) maintaining the connection alive !!

       <b>Packet</b> <b>filtering/dropping:</b> You can set up a filter script that searches for  a  particular  string  (even
       hex)  in the TCP or UDP payload and replace it with yours or drop the entire packet. The filtering engine
       can match any field of the network protocols and modify whatever you want (see <a href="../man8/etterfilter.8.html">etterfilter</a>(8)).

       <b>Remote</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>sniffing</b> <b>through</b> <b>tunnels</b> <b>and</b> <b>route</b> <b>mangling:</b> You can play with linux cooked interfaces  or
       use  the integrated plugin to sniff tunneled or route-mangled remote connections and perform mitm attacks
       on them.

       <b>Plug-ins</b> <b>support</b> <b>:</b> You can create your own plugin using the ettercap's API.

       <b>Password</b> <b>collector</b> <b>for</b> <b>:</b> TELNET, FTP, POP, RLOGIN, SSH1, ICQ, SMB, MySQL, HTTP, NNTP, X11, NAPSTER,  IRC,
       RIP,  BGP,  SOCKS  5, IMAP 4, VNC, LDAP, NFS, SNMP, HALF LIFE, QUAKE 3, MSN, YMSG (other protocols coming
       soon...)

       <b>Passive</b> <b>OS</b> <b>fingerprint:</b> you scan passively the lan (without sending any packet) and gather detailed  info
       about  the  hosts in the LAN: Operating System, running services, open ports, IP, mac address and network
       adapter vendor.

       <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection:</b> from the connections list you can kill all the connections you want

</pre><h4><b>TARGET</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       There is no concept of SOURCE nor DEST. The two targets are intended to filter traffic coming from one to
       the other and vice-versa (since the connection is bidirectional).

       <u>TARGET</u> is in the form <u>MAC/IPs/PORTs</u>.
       <b>NOTE:</b> If IPv6 is enabled, <u>TARGET</u> is in the form <u>MAC/IPs/IPv6/PORTs</u>.

       If you want you can omit any of its parts and this will represent an ANY in that part.
       e.g.
       "//80" means ANY mac address, ANY ip and ONLY port 80
       "/10.0.0.1/" means ANY mac address, ONLY ip 10.0.0.1 and ANY port

       <u>MAC</u> must be unique and in the form 00:11:22:33:44:55

       <u>IPs</u> is a range of IP in dotted notation. You can specify range with the - (hyphen) and single ip  with  ,
       (comma). You can also use ; (semicolon) to indicate different ip addresses.
       e.g.
       "10.0.0.1-5;10.0.1.33" expands into ip 10.0.0.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10.0.1.33

       <u>PORTs</u> is a range of PORTS. You can specify range with the - (hyphen) and single port with , (comma).
       e.g.
       "20-25,80,110" expands into ports 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 80 and 110

       <b>NOTE:</b>
       you can reverse the matching of the TARGET by adding the -R option to the command line. So if you want to
       sniff ALL the traffic BUT the one coming or going to 10.0.0.1 you can specify "./ettercap -R /10.0.0.1/"

       <b>NOTE:</b>
       TARGETs  are  also  responsible  of the initial scan of the lan. You can use them to restrict the scan to
       only a subset of the hosts in the netmask. The result of the merging between  the  two  targets  will  be
       scanned.  remember  that  not  specifying  a target means "no target", but specifying "//" means "all the
       hosts in the subnet".

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGES</b> <b>DROPPING</b></h4><pre>
       ettercap needs root privileges to open the Link Layer sockets. After the initialization phase,  the  root
       privs are not needed anymore, so ettercap drops them to UID = 65535 (nobody). Since ettercap has to write
       (create)  log  files,  it must be executed in a directory with the right permissions (e.g. <a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>). If you
       want to drop privs to a different uid, you can export the environment variable EC_UID with the  value  of
       the  uid  you  want  to  drop  the privs to (e.g.  export EC_UID=500) or set the correct parameter in the
       etter.conf file.

</pre><h4><b>SSL</b> <b>MITM</b> <b>ATTACK</b></h4><pre>
       SSL mitm attack is dependent on TCP traffic redirection to  a  custom  listener  port  of  ettercap.  The
       redir_command_on and redir_command_off configuration variables take care of this (see "<a href="../man5/etter.conf.5.html">etter.conf</a>(5)").
       However,  when  ettercap starts, traffic for any source and any destination targeted for the redirectable
       services will be redirected to ettercap and the SSL stream will be intercepted.
       This may not be the desired behaviour. Therefore you can adjust the redirect  rules  after  ettercap  has
       been started using the selected user interface.

       While  performing  the  SSL  mitm attack, ettercap substitutes the real ssl certificate with its own. The
       fake certificate is created on the fly and all the fields are filled according to the real cert presented
       by the server.  Only  the  issuer  is  modified  and  signed  with  the  private  key  contained  in  the
       'etter.ssl.crt'  file.  If  you  want to use a different private key you have to regenerate this file. To
       regenerate the cert file use the following commands:

       openssl genrsa -out etter.ssl.crt 1024
       openssl req -new -key etter.ssl.crt -out tmp.csr
       openssl x509 -req -days 1825 -in tmp.csr -signkey etter.ssl.crt -out tmp.new
       cat tmp.new &gt;&gt; etter.ssl.crt
       rm -f tmp.new tmp.csr

       NOTE: SSL mitm is not available (for now) in bridged mode.

       NOTE: You can use the --certificate/--private-key long options if you want to specify  a  different  file
       rather than the etter.ssl.crt file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options that make sense together can generally be combined. ettercap will warn the user about unsupported
       option combinations.

       <b>SNIFFING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ATTACK</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>

       ettercap  NG  has  a new unified sniffing method. This implies that ip_forwarding in the kernel is always
       disabled and the forwarding is done by ettercap. Every packet with destination mac address equal  to  the
       host's  mac address and destination ip address different for the one bound to the iface will be forwarded
       by ettercap. Before forwarding them, ettercap can content filter, sniff, log or drop them.  It  does  not
       matter  how these packets are hijacked, ettercap will process them. You can even use external programs to
       hijack packet.
       You have full control of what ettercap should receive. You can use the internal  mitm  attacks,  set  the
       interface in promisc mode, use plugins or use every method you want.

       IMPORTANT  NOTE: if you run ettercap on a gateway, remember to re-enable the ip_forwarding after you have
       killed ettercap. Since ettercap drops its privileges, it cannot restore the ip_forwarding for you.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--mitm</b> <b>&lt;METHOD:ARGS&gt;</b>
              MITM attack
              This option will activate the man in the middle attack. The mitm  attack  is  totally  independent
              from  the  sniffing. The aim of the attack is to hijack packets and redirect them to ettercap. The
              sniffing engine will forward them if necessary.
              You can choose the mitm attack that you prefer and also combine some of them to perform  different
              attacks at the same time.
              If  a  mitm  method  requires  some  parameters  you  can specify them after the colon.  (e.g.  -M
              dhcp:ip_pool,netmask,etc )

              The following mitm attacks are available:

              <b>arp</b> ([remote],[oneway])
                     This method implements the ARP poisoning mitm attack. ARP requests/replies are sent to  the
                     victims  to  poison their ARP cache. Once the cache has been poisoned the victims will send
                     all packets to the attacker which, in turn,  can  modify  and  forward  them  to  the  real
                     destination.

                     In  silent  mode  (-z  option)  only  the  first  target is selected, if you want to poison
                     multiple target in silent mode use the -j option to load a list from a file.

                     You can select empty targets and they will be expanded as 'ANY' (all the hosts in the LAN).
                     The target list is joined with the hosts list (created by the arp scan) and the  result  is
                     used to determine the victims of the attack.

                     The  parameter  "remote" is optional and you have to specify it if you want to sniff remote
                     ip address poisoning a gateway. Indeed if you specify a victim and the gw in  the  TARGETS,
                     ettercap  will  sniff  only  connection  between  them,  but  to  enable  ettercap to sniff
                     connections that pass thru the gw, you have to use this parameter.

                     The parameter "oneway" will force ettercap to poison only from TARGET1 to  TARGET2.  Useful
                     if  you  want  to poison only the client and not the router (where an arp watcher can be in
                     place).

                     Example:

                     the targets are: /10.0.0.1-5/ /10.0.0.15-20/
                     and the host list is: 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.3 10.0.0.16 10.0.0.18

                     the associations between the victims will be:
                     1 and 16, 1 and 18, 3 and 16, 3 and 18

                     if the targets overlap each other, the  association  with  identical  ip  address  will  be
                     skipped.

                     NOTE: if you manage to poison a client, you have to set correct routing table in the kernel
                     specifying  the  GW.  If  your routing table is incorrect, the poisoned clients will not be
                     able to navigate the Internet.

              <b>icmp</b> (MAC/IP)
                     This attack implements ICMP redirection. It sends a spoofed icmp redirect  message  to  the
                     hosts  in the lan pretending to be a better route for internet. All connections to internet
                     will be redirected to the attacker which, in turn, will forward them to the  real  gateway.
                     The  resulting  attack  is  a  HALF-DUPLEX  mitm.  Only the client is redirected, since the
                     gateway will not accept redirect messages for a directly connected network. BE SURE TO  NOT
                     USE FILTERS THAT MODIFY THE PAYLOAD LENGTH. you can use a filter to modify packets, but the
                     length must be the same since the tcp sequences cannot be updated in both ways.
                     You have to pass as argument the MAC and the IP address of the real gateway for the lan.
                     Obviously  you have to be able to sniff all the traffic. If you are on a switch you have to
                     use a different mitm attack such as arp poisoning.

                     NOTE: to restrict the redirection to a given target, specify it as a TARGET

                     Example:

                     -M icmp:00:11:22:33:44:55/10.0.0.1

                     will redirect all the connections that pass thru that gateway.

              <b>dhcp</b> (ip_pool/netmask/dns)
                     This attack implements DHCP spoofing. It pretends to be a DHCP server and tries to win  the
                     race  condition  with the real one to force the client to accept the attacker's reply. This
                     way ettercap is able to manipulate the GW parameter and hijack  all  the  outgoing  traffic
                     generated by the clients.
                     The  resulting  attack  is  a  HALF-DUPLEX mitm. So be sure to use appropriate filters (see
                     above in the ICMP section).

                     You have to pass the ip pool to be used, the netmask and the ip of the dns  server.   Since
                     ettercap tries to win the race with the real server, it DOES NOT CHECK if the ip is already
                     assigned.  You have to specify an ip pool of FREE addresses to be used. The ip pool has the
                     same form of the target specification.

                     If the client sends a dhcp request (suggesting an ip address) ettercap will ack on that  ip
                     and  modify only the gw option. If the client makes a dhcp discovery, ettercap will use the
                     first unused ip address of the list you have specified on  command  line.  Every  discovery
                     consumes an ip address. When the list is over, ettercap stops offering new ip addresses and
                     will reply only to dhcp requests.
                     If  you  don't want to offer any ip address, but only change the router information of dhcp
                     request/ack, you can specify an empty ip_pool.

                     BIG WARNING: if you specify a list of ip that are in use, you will mess  your  network!  In
                     general,  use  this  attack  carefully.  It  can  really mess things up!  When you stop the
                     attack, all the victims will be still convinced that ettercap  is  the  gateway  until  the
                     lease expires...

                     Example:

                     -M dhcp:192.168.0.30,35,50-60/255.255.255.0/192.168.0.1
                     reply to DHCP offer and request.

                     -M dhcp:/255.255.255.0/192.168.0.1
                     reply only to DHCP request.

              <b>port</b> ([remote],[tree])
                     This  attack  implements  Port  Stealing.  This  technique is useful to sniff in a switched
                     environment when ARP poisoning is not effective (for example where static mapped  ARPs  are
                     used).

                     It floods the LAN (based on port_steal_delay option in etter.conf) with ARP packets. If you
                     don't  specify  the "tree" option, the destination MAC address of each "stealing" packet is
                     the same as the attacker's one (other NICs won't see these packets), the source MAC address
                     will be one of the MACs in the host list. This process "steals" the  switch  port  of  each
                     victim host in the host list.  Using low delays, packets destined to "stolen" MAC addresses
                     will  be  received  by  the  attacker, winning the race condition with the real port owner.
                     When the attacker receives packets for "stolen" hosts, it stops the  flooding  process  and
                     performs  an  ARP request for the real destination of the packet.  When it receives the ARP
                     reply it's sure that the victim has "taken back" his port,  so  ettercap  can  re-send  the
                     packet  to the destination as is.  Now we can re-start the flooding process waiting for new
                     packets.

                     If you use the "tree" option, the destination MAC address of each stealing packet will be a
                     bogus one, so these packets will be propagated to other switches  (not  only  the  directly
                     connected  one). This way you will be able to steal ports on other switches in the tree (if
                     any), but you will generate a huge amount of traffic (according to port_steal_delay).   The
                     "remote" option has the same meaning as in "arp" mitm method.

                     When you stop the attack, ettercap will send an ARP request to each stolen host giving back
                     their switch ports.
                     You can perform either HALF or FULL DUPLEX mitm according to target selection.

                     NOTE:  Use  this  mitm method only on ethernet switches. Use it carefully, it could produce
                     performances loss or general havoc.

                     NOTE: You can NOT use this method in  only-mitm  mode  (-o  flag),  because  it  hooks  the
                     sniffing engine, and you can't use interactive data injection.

                     NOTE: It could be dangerous to use it in conjunction with other mitm methods.

                     NOTE: This mitm method doesn't work on Solaris and Windows because of the lipcap and libnet
                     design  and  the  lack  of  certain ioctl().  (We will feature this method on these OSes if
                     someone will request it...)

                     Example:

                     The targets are: /10.0.0.1/ /10.0.0.15/
                     You will intercept and visualize traffic between  10.0.0.1  and  10.0.0.15,  but  you  will
                     receive all the traffic for 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.15 too.

                     The target is: /10.0.0.1/
                     You will intercept and visualize all the traffic for 10.0.0.1.

              <b>ndp</b> ([remote],[oneway])
                     <b>NOTE:</b> This MITM method is only supported if IPv6 support has been enabled.

                     This method implements the NDP poisoning attack which is used for MITM of IPv6 connections.
                     ND  requests/replies are sent to the victims to poison their neighbor cache. Once the cache
                     has been poisoned the victims will send all IPv6 packets to the attacker  which,  in  turn,
                     can modify and forward them to the real destination.

                     In  silent  mode  (-z  option)  only  the  first  target is selected, if you want to poison
                     multiple target in silent mode use the -j option to load a list from a file.

                     You can select empty targets and they will be expanded as 'ANY' (all the hosts in the LAN).
                     The target list is joined with the hosts list (created by the arp scan) and the  result  is
                     used to determine the victims of the attack.

                     The  parameter  "remote" is optional and you have to specify it if you want to sniff remote
                     ip address poisoning a gateway. Indeed if you specify a victim and the gw in  the  TARGETS,
                     ettercap  will  sniff  only  connection  between  them,  but  to  enable  ettercap to sniff
                     connections that pass thru the gw, you have to use this parameter.

                     The parameter "oneway" will force ettercap to poison only from TARGET1 to  TARGET2.  Useful
                     if  you  want  to poison only the client and not the router (where an arp watcher can be in
                     place).

                     Example:

                     Targets are: //fe80::260d:afff:fe6e:f378/ //2001:db8::2:1/
                     Ranges of IPv6 addresses are not yet supported.

                     NOTE: if you manage to poison a client, you have to set correct routing table in the kernel
                     specifying the GW. If your routing table is incorrect, the poisoned  clients  will  not  be
                     able to navigate the Internet.

                     NOTE:  in  IPv6  usually  the link-local address of the router is being used as the gateway
                     address. Therefore you need to set the link-local address of the router as one  target  and
                     the  global-unicast address of the victim as the other in order to set up a successful IPv6
                     MITM attack using NDP poisoning.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--only-mitm</b>
              This options disables the sniffing thread and enables only the mitm attack.  Useful if you want to
              use ettercap to perform mitm attacks and another sniffer (such as wireshark) to sniff the traffic.
              Keep in mind that the packets are not forwarded by ettercap. The kernel will  be  responsible  for
              the forwarding.  Remember to activate the "ip forwarding" feature in your kernel.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--pcapfilter</b> <b>&lt;FILTER&gt;</b>
              Set  a  capturing  filter in the pcap library. The format is the same as <a href="../man1/tcpdump.1.html">tcpdump</a>(1). Remember that
              this kind of filter will not sniff packets out of the wire, so if  you  want  to  perform  a  mitm
              attack, ettercap will not be able to forward hijacked packets.
              These filters are useful to decrease the network load impact into ettercap decoding module.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--bridge</b> <b>&lt;IFACE&gt;</b>
              BRIDGED sniffing
              You  need  two  network interfaces. ettercap will forward form one to the other all the traffic it
              sees. It is useful for man in the middle at the physical layer. It is totally stealthy since it is
              passive and there is no way for an user to see the attacker.
              You can content filter all the traffic as you were a transparent proxy for the "cable".

       <b>OFF</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>SNIFFING</b>

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--read</b> <b>&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              OFF LINE sniffing
              With this option enabled, ettercap will sniff packets from  a  pcap  compatible  file  instead  of
              capturing from the wire.
              This  is  useful  if  you  have  a  file  dumped from tcpdump or wireshark and you want to make an
              analysis (search for passwords or passive fingerprint) on it.
              Obviously you cannot use "active" sniffing (arp poisoning or bridging) while sniffing from a file.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--write</b> <b>&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              WRITE packet to a pcap file
              This is useful if you have to use "active" sniffing (arp poison) on a switched LAN but you want to
              analyze the packets with tcpdump or wireshark. You can use this option to dump the  packets  to  a
              file and then load it into your favourite application.

              NOTE: dump file collect ALL the packets disregarding the TARGET. This is done because you may want
              to log even protocols not supported by ettercap, so you can analyze them with other tools.

              TIP: you can use the -w option in conjunction with the -r one. This way you will be able to filter
              the  payload  of the dumped packets or decrypt WEP-encrypted WiFi traffic and dump them to another
              file.

       <b>USER</b> <b>INTERFACES</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--text</b>
              The text only interface, only printf ;)
              It is quite interactive, press 'h' in every moment to get help on what you can do.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Quiet mode. It can be used only in conjunction with the  console  interface.  It  does  not  print
              packet content. It is useful if you want to convert pcap file to ettercap log files.

              example:

              ettercap -Tq -L dumpfile -r pcapfile

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--script</b> <b>&lt;COMMANDS&gt;</b>
              With  this  option  you  can  feed ettercap with command as they were typed on the keyboard by the
              user. This way you can use ettercap within your favourite scripts. There is a special command  you
              can issue thru this command: s(x). this command will sleep for x seconds.

              example:

              ettercap -T -s 'lq'  will print the list of the hosts and exit
              ettercap  -T  -s  '<a href="../man300/s.300.html">s</a>(300)olqq'   will collect the infos for 5 minutes, print the list of the local
              profiles and exit

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--curses</b>
              Ncurses based GUI. See <a href="../man8/ettercap_curses.8.html">ettercap_curses</a>(8) for a full description.

       <b>-G</b>, <b>--gtk</b>
              The nice GTK2 interface (thanks Daten...).

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--daemonize</b>
              Daemonize ettercap. This option will detach ettercap from the current controlling terminal and set
              it as a daemon. You can combine this feature with the "log" option to log all the traffic  in  the
              background.    If    the    daemon   fails   for   any   reason,   it   will   create   the   file
              "./ettercap_daemonized.log" in which the error caught by ettercap will be  reported.  Furthermore,
              if  you  want  to  have  a  complete  debug of the daemon process, you are encouraged to recompile
              ettercap in debug mode.

       <b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--broadcast</b>
              Tells Ettercap to process packets coming from Broadcast address.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--iface</b> <b>&lt;IFACE&gt;</b>
              Use this &lt;IFACE&gt; instead of the default one. The interface can be unconfigured (requires libnet &gt;=
              1.1.2), but in this case you cannot use MITM attacks and you should set the unoffensive flag.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--iflist</b>
              This option will print the list of all available  network  interfaces  that  can  be  used  within
              ettercap.  The  option is particularly useful under windows where the name of the interface is not
              so obvious as under *nix.

       <b>-Y</b>, <b>--secondary</b> <b>&lt;interface</b> <b>list&gt;</b>
              Specify a list of (or single) secondary interfaces to capture packets from.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--address</b> <b>&lt;ADDRESS&gt;</b>
              Use this &lt;ADDRESS&gt; instead of the one autodetected for the current iface. This option is useful if
              you have an interface with multiple ip addresses.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--netmask</b> <b>&lt;NETMASK&gt;</b>
              Use this &lt;NETMASK&gt; instead of the one associated with the current iface. This option is useful  if
              you  have  the  NIC with an associated netmask of class B and you want to scan (with the arp scan)
              only a class C.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--reversed</b>
              Reverse the matching in the TARGET selection. It means not(TARGET). All but the selected TARGET.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--proto</b> <b>&lt;PROTO&gt;</b>
              Sniff only PROTO packets (default is TCP + UDP).
              This is useful if you want to select  a  port  via  the  TARGET  specification  but  you  want  to
              differentiate between tcp or udp.
              PROTO can be "tcp", "udp" or "all" for both.

       <b>-6</b>, <b>--ip6scan</b>
              Send  ICMPv6  probes to discover active IPv6 nodes on the link.  This options sends a ping request
              to the all-nodes address to motivate active IPv6 hosts to respond. You should not use this  option
              if you try to hide yourself. Therefore this option is optional.

              NOTE: This option is only available if IPv6 support has been enabled.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--silent</b>
              Do not perform the initial ARP scan of the LAN.

              NOTE:  you  will  not have the hosts list, so you can't use the multipoison feature.  you can only
              select two hosts for an ARP poisoning attack, specifying them through the TARGETs

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--nopromisc</b>
              Usually, ettercap will put the interface in promisc mode to sniff all the traffic on the wire.  If
              you want to sniff only your connections, use this flag to NOT enable the promisc mode.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--nosslmitm</b>
              Usually,  ettercap  forges  SSL  certificates  in  order  to intercept https traffic.  This option
              disables that behavior.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--unoffensive</b>
              Every time ettercap starts, it disables ip forwarding in the kernel and begins to forward  packets
              itself.  This  option  prevent  to  do that, so the responsibility of ip forwarding is left to the
              kernel.
              This options is useful if you want to run multiple ettercap instances. You will have one  instance
              (the  one  without  the -u option) forwarding the packets, and all the other instances doing their
              work without forwarding them. Otherwise you will get packet duplicates.
              It also disables the  internal  creation  of  the  sessions  for  each  connection.  It  increases
              performances, but you will not be able to modify packets on the fly.
              If you want to use a mitm attack you have to use a separate instance.
              You have to use this option if the interface is unconfigured (without an ip address.)
              This is also useful if you want to run ettercap on the gateway. It will not disable the forwarding
              and the gateway will correctly route the packets.

       <b>-j</b>, <b>--load-hosts</b> <b>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</b>
              It can be used to load a hosts list from a file created by the -k option. (see below)

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--save-hosts</b> <b>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</b>
              Saves  the  hosts  list to a file. Useful when you have many hosts and you don't want to do an ARP
              storm at startup any time you use ettercap. Simply use this options and dump the list to  a  file,
              then to load the information from it use the -j &lt;filename&gt; option.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--plugin</b> <b>&lt;PLUGIN&gt;</b>
              Run  the  selected  PLUGIN.  Many  plugins  need  target  specification, use TARGET as always. Use
              multiple occurrences of this parameter to select multiple plugins.
              In console mode (-C option), standalone plugins are executed and then the application exits.  Hook
              plugins are activated and the normal sniffing is performed.
              To  have a list of the available external plugins use "list" (without quotes) as plugin name (e.g.
              ./ettercap -P list).

              NOTE: you can also activate plugins directly from the interfaces (always  press  "h"  to  get  the
              inline help)

              More  detailed  info  about  plugins  and  about  how  to write your own are found in the man page
              <a href="../man8/ettercap_plugins.8.html">ettercap_plugins</a>(8)

       <b>--plugin-list</b> <b>&lt;PLUGIN1&gt;[,&lt;PLUGIN2&gt;,...]</b>
              Instead of providing multiple occurances of -P plugin, --plugin-list can be  used  followed  by  a
              comma sepaparated list without any spaces.  (e.g. ./ettercap --plugin-list plugin1,plugin2).

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--filter</b> <b>&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Load the filter from the file &lt;FILE&gt;. The filter must be compiled with <a href="../man8/etterfilter.8.html">etterfilter</a>(8). The utility
              will  compile  the  filter  script  and produce an ettercap-compliant binary filter file. Read the
              <a href="../man8/etterfilter.8.html">etterfilter</a>(8) man page for the list of functions you can use inside a filter script.  Any  number
              of  filters can be loaded by specifying the option multiple times; packets are passed through each
              filter in the order specified on the command line.  You can also load a script without enabling it
              by appending :0 to the filename.
              NOTE: these filters are different from those set  with  --pcapfilter.  An  ettercap  filter  is  a
              content  filter  and can modify the payload of a packet before forwarding it. Pcap filter are used
              to capture only certain packets.
              NOTE: you can use filters on pcapfile to modify them and save to another file, but  in  this  case
              you  have  to  pay attention on what you are doing, since ettercap will not recalculate checksums,
              nor split packets exceeding the mtu (snaplen) nor anything like that.

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--wifi-key</b> <b>&lt;KEY&gt;</b>
              You can specify a  key  to  decrypt  WiFi  packets  (WEP  or  WPA).  Only  the  packets  decrypted
              successfully will be passed to the decoders stack, the others will be skipped with a message.
              The  parameter  has the following syntax: type:bits:t:string. Where 'type' can be: wep, wpa-pws or
              wpa-psk, 'bits' is the bit length of the key (64, 128 or 256), 't' is the type of the string  ('s'
              for string and 'p' for passphrase). 'string' can be a string or an escaped hex sequences.

              example:
              --wifi-key wep:128:p:secret
              --wifi-key wep:128:s:ettercapwep0
              --wifi-key 'wep:64:s:\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05'
              --wifi-key wpa:pwd:ettercapwpa:ssid
              --wifi-key wpa:psk:
              663eb260e87cf389c6bd7331b28d82f5203b0cae4e315f9cbb7602f3236708a6

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--config</b> <b>&lt;CONFIG&gt;</b>
              Loads an alternative config file instead of the default in /etc/etter.conf.  This is useful if you
              have many preconfigured files for different situations.

       <b>--certificate</b> <b>&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Tells Ettercap to use the specified certificate file for the SSL MiTM attack.

       <b>--private-key</b> <b>&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Tells Ettercap to use the specified private key file for the SSL MiTM attack.

       <b>VISUALIZATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--regex</b> <b>&lt;REGEX&gt;</b>
              Handle only packets that match the regex.
              This  option  is  useful  in  conjunction with -L. It logs only packets that match the posix regex
              REGEX.
              It impacts even the visualization of the sniffed packets. If it is set only packets  matching  the
              regex will be displayed.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--visual</b> <b>&lt;FORMAT&gt;</b>
              Use this option to set the visualization method for the packets to be displayed.

              FORMAT may be one of the following:

              <b>hex</b>    Print the packets in hex format.

                     example:

                     the string  "HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified"  becomes:

                     0000: 4854 5450 2f31 2e31 2033 3034 204e 6f74  HTTP/1.1 304 Not
                     0010: 204d 6f64 6966 6965 64                    Modified

              <b>ascii</b>  Print only "printable" characters, the others are displayed as dots '.'

              <b>text</b>   Print only the "printable" characters and skip the others.

              <b>ebcdic</b> Convert an EBCDIC text to ASCII.

              <b>html</b>   Strip all the html tags from the text. A tag is every string between &lt; and &gt;.

                     example:

                     &lt;title&gt;This is the title&lt;/title&gt;, but the following &lt;string&gt; will not be displayed.

                     This is the title, but the following will not be displayed.

              <b>utf8</b>   Print  the  packets  in  UTF-8 format. The encoding used while performing the conversion is
                     declared in the <a href="../man5/etter.conf.5.html">etter.conf</a>(5) file.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--dns</b>
              Resolve ip addresses into hostnames.

              NOTE: this may seriously slow down ettercap while logging passive information.  Every time  a  new
              host  is  found, a query to the dns is performed. Ettercap keeps a cache for already resolved host
              to increase the speed, but new hosts need a new query and the dns may take up to 2 or 3 seconds to
              respond for an unknown host.

              HINT: ettercap collects the dns replies it sniffs in the resolution table, so even if you  specify
              to  not  resolve  the  hostnames,  some  of them will be resolved because the reply was previously
              sniffed. think about it as a passive dns resolution for free... ;)

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--ext-headers</b>
              Print extended headers for every displayed packet. (e.g. mac addresses)

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--superquiet</b>
              Super quiet mode. Do not print users and passwords as they are collected. Only store them  in  the
              profiles. It can be useful to run ettercap in text only mode but you don't want to be flooded with
              dissectors  messages.  Useful when using plugins because the sniffing process is always active, it
              will print all the collected infos, with this option you can suppress these messages.
              NOTE: this options automatically sets the -q option.

              example:

              ettercap -TzQP finger /192.168.0.1/22

       <b>LOGGING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--log</b> <b>&lt;LOGFILE&gt;</b>
              Log all the packets to binary files. These files can be parsed by  <a href="../man8/etterlog.8.html">etterlog</a>(8)  to  extract  human
              readable data. With this option, all packets sniffed by ettercap will be logged, together with all
              the  passive  info (host info + user &amp; pass) it can collect. Given a LOGFILE, ettercap will create
              LOGFILE.ecp (for packets) and LOGFILE.eci (for the infos).

              NOTE: if you specify this option on command line you don't have to take care of  privileges  since
              the  log  file  is opened in the startup phase (with high privs). But if you enable the log option
              while ettercap is already started, you have to be in a directory where uid = 65535 or uid = EC_UID
              can write.

              NOTE: the logfiles can be compressed with the deflate algorithm using the -c option.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--log-info</b> <b>&lt;LOGFILE&gt;</b>
              Very similar to -L but it logs only passive information + users and passwords for each  host.  The
              file will be named LOGFILE.eci

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--log-msg</b> <b>&lt;LOGFILE&gt;</b>
              It  stores in &lt;LOGFILE&gt; all the user messages printed by ettercap. This can be useful when you are
              using ettercap in daemon mode or if you  want  to  track  down  all  the  messages.  Indeed,  some
              dissectors print messages but their information is not stored anywhere, so this is the only way to
              keep track of them.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--compress</b>
              Compress  the  logfile  with  the  gzip  algorithm  while  it is dumped. <a href="../man8/etterlog.8.html">etterlog</a>(8) is capable of
              handling both compressed and uncompressed log files.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--only-local</b>
              Stores profiles information belonging only to the LAN hosts.

              NOTE: this option is effective only against the profiles collected in memory.  While logging to  a
              file ALL the hosts are logged. If you want to split them, use the related <a href="../man8/etterlog.8.html">etterlog</a>(8) option.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--only-remote</b>
              Stores profiles information belonging only to remote hosts.

       <b>STANDARD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print the version and exit.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              prints the help screen with a short summary of the available options.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here are some examples of using ettercap.

       <b>ettercap</b> <b>-Tp</b>

              Use  the  console  interface  and do not put the interface in promisc mode. You will see only your
              traffic.

       <b>ettercap</b> <b>-Tzq</b>

              Use the console interface, do not ARP scan the net and be quiet. The packet content  will  not  be
              displayed, but user and passwords, as well as other messages, will be displayed.

       <b>ettercap</b> <b>-T</b> <b>-j</b> <b>/tmp/victims</b> <b>-M</b> <b>arp</b> <b>/10.0.0.1-7/</b> <b>/10.0.0.10-20/</b>

              Will  load  the  hosts  list from /tmp/victims and perform an ARP poisoning attack against the two
              target. The list will be joined with the target and the resulting list is used for ARP poisoning.

       <b>ettercap</b> <b>-T</b> <b>-M</b> <b>arp</b> <b>//</b> <b>//</b>

              Perform the ARP poisoning attack against all the hosts in the LAN. BE CAREFUL !!

       <b>ettercap</b> <b>-T</b> <b>-M</b> <b>arp:remote</b> <b>/192.168.1.1/</b> <b>/192.168.1.2-10/</b>

              Perform the ARP poisoning against the gateway and the host in  the  lan  between  2  and  10.  The
              'remote'  option  is  needed  to  be  able  to sniff the remote traffic the hosts make through the
              gateway.

       <b>ettercap</b> <b>-Tzq</b> <b>//110</b>

              Sniff only the pop3 protocol from every hosts.

       <b>ettercap</b> <b>-Tzq</b> <b>/10.0.0.1/21,22,23</b>

              Sniff telnet, ftp and ssh connections to 10.0.0.1.

       <b>ettercap</b> <b>-P</b> <b>list</b>

              Prints the list of all available plugins

       Our software never has bugs.
       It just develops random features.   ;)

       <b>KNOWN-BUGS</b>

       - ettercap doesn't handle fragmented packets... only the first segment will be displayed by the  sniffer.
       However all the fragments are correctly forwarded.

       + please send bug-report, patches or suggestions to &lt;<a href="mailto:ettercap-betatesting@lists.sourceforge.net">ettercap-betatesting@lists.sourceforge.net</a>&gt; or visit
       https://github.com/Ettercap/ettercap/issues.

</pre><h4><b>PHILOLOGICAL</b> <b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       "Even  if  blessed  with  a feeble intelligence, they are cruel and smart..."  this is the description of
       Ettercap, a monster of the RPG Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragon.

       The name "ettercap" was chosen because it has an assonance with "ethercap" which means "ethernet capture"
       (what ettercap actually does) and also because such monsters have a powerful poison... and you know,  arp
       poisoning... ;)

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>Lord</b> <b>Of</b> <b>The</b> <b>(Token)Ring</b></h4><pre>
       (the fellowship of the packet)

       "One Ring to link them all, One Ring to ping them,
        one Ring to bring them all and in the darkness sniff them."

</pre><h4><b>Last</b> <b>words</b></h4><pre>
       "Programming  today  is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof
       programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is  winning."
       - Rich Cook
