</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>arpwatch</b> [ <b>-dN</b> ]
               [ <b>-f</b> <u>datafile</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Arpwatch</b>  keeps  track  for ethernet/ip address pairings. It syslogs activity and reports certain changes
       via email.  <b>Arpwatch</b> uses <b><a href="../man3/pcap.3.html">pcap</a></b>(3) to listen for arp packets on a local ethernet interface.

       The <b>-d</b> flag is used enable debugging. This also inhibits forking into the  background  and  emailing  the
       reports. Instead, they are sent to <u>stderr</u>.

       The <b>-f</b> flag is used to set the ethernet/ip address database filename.  The default is <u>arp.dat</u>.

       The <b>-i</b> flag is used to override the default interface.

       The  <b>-n</b> flag specifies additional local networks. This can be useful to avoid "bogon" warnings when there
       is more than one network running on the same wire. If the optional <u>width</u> is not  specified,  the  default
       netmask for the network's class is used.

       The <b>-N</b> flag disables reporting any bogons.

       The  <b>-r</b>  flag  is  used to specify a savefile (perhaps created by <b><a href="../man1/tcpdump.1.html">tcpdump</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/pcapture.1.html">pcapture</a></b>(1)) to read from
       instead of reading from the network. In this case, <b>arpwatch</b> does not fork.

       (Debian) The <b>-F</b> option is used to specify a pcap  filter,  which  provides  a  generic  way  of  ignoring
       specific  packets.  The applied pcap filter will be "(arp or rarp) and not vlan and (filter)".  See <b><a href="../man7/pcapfilter.7.html">pcap-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man7/pcapfilter.7.html">filter</a></b>(7) for the syntax of that string.

       (Debian) The <b>-s</b> flag is used to specify the path to the sendmail program.  Any  program  that  takes  the
       option  -odi  and  then text from stdin can be substituted. This is useful for redirecting reports to log
       files instead of mail.

       (Debian) The <b>-p</b> flag disables promiscuous operation.  ARP broadcasts get through hubs without having  the
       interface  in  promiscuous  mode,  while saving considerable resources that would be wasted on processing
       gigabytes of non-broadcast traffic.  OTOH, setting promiscuous mode does not mean  getting  100%  traffic
       that would concern <b>arpwatch</b> <b>.</b>  YMMV.

       (Debian)  <b>-a</b>  By  default,  <b>arpwatch</b>  only  logs  bogons  but  otherwise  ignores them. If this option is
       specified, <b>arpwatch</b> will perform normal processing with bogon packets and  send  reports  about  detected
       events. This option can be combined with <b>-N</b> to disable the report of the packet being a bogon (processing
       will still be done).

       (Debian)  The <b>-m</b> option is used to specify the e-mail address to which reports will be sent.  By default,
       reports are sent to <u>root</u> on the local machine.

       (Debian) The <b>-u</b> flag instructs <b>arpwatch</b> to drop root privileges and change the UID to <u>username</u> and GID to
       the primary group of <u>username</u> <u>.</u>  This is recommended for security reasons, but <u>username</u> has to have write
       access to the default directory.

       (Debian) The <b>-Q</b> flags prevents arpwatch from sending reports by mail.

       (Debian) The <b>-z</b> option is used to set a range of ip addresses to ignore (such as a DHCP range).  Both the
       ignorenet and the ignoremask are specified in numbers-and-dots notation and separated from each other  by
       a slash (/).  Specifying the ignoremask by subnet length is not supported.  If the ignoremask is omitted,
       255.255.255.255 is assumed.  Example: -z 192.168.10.0/255.255.255.0

       Note that an empty <u>arp.dat</u> file must be created before the first time you run <b>arpwatch</b>.

</pre><h4><b>REPORT</b> <b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       Here's a quick list of the report messages generated by <b><a href="../man1/arpwatch.1.html">arpwatch</a></b>(1) (and <b><a href="../man1/arpsnmp.1.html">arpsnmp</a></b>(1)):

       <b>new</b> <b>activity</b>
              This ethernet/ip address pair has been used for the first time six months or more.

       <b>new</b> <b>station</b>
              The ethernet address has not been seen before.

       <b>flip</b> <b>flop</b>
              The  ethernet  address has changed from the most recently seen address to the second most recently
              seen address.  (If either the old or new ethernet address is a DECnet address and it is less  than
              24 hours, the email version of the report is suppressed.)

       <b>changed</b> <b>ethernet</b> <b>address</b>
              The host switched to a new ethernet address.

</pre><h4><b>SYSLOG</b> <b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       Here are some of the syslog messages; note that messages that are reported are also sysloged.

       <b>ethernet</b> <b>broadcast</b>
              The mac ethernet address of the host is a broadcast address.

       <b>ip</b> <b>broadcast</b>
              The ip address of the host is a broadcast address.

       <b>bogon</b>  The source ip address is not local to the local subnet.

       <b>ethernet</b> <b>broadcast</b>
              The source mac or arp ethernet address was all ones or all zeros.

       <b>ethernet</b> <b>mismatch</b>
              The source mac ethernet address didn't match the address inside the arp packet.

       <b>reused</b> <b>old</b> <b>ethernet</b> <b>address</b>
              The  ethernet  address  has  changed from the most recently seen address to the third (or greater)
              least recently seen address.  (This is similar to a flip flop.)

       <b>suppressed</b> <b>DECnet</b> <b>flip</b> <b>flop</b>
              A "flip flop" report was suppressed because one of the two addresses was a DECnet address.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /var/lib/arpwatch - default directory
       IFNAME.dat - ethernet/ip address database observed on interface IFNAME
       ethercodes.db - vendor ethernet block list
