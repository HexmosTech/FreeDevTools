</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       snsplit - split an article stream into individual articles

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>snsplit</b> [-<u>r</u>] [<u>field</u>... -] <u>prog</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>snsplit</b>  reads an article stream from descriptor 0 and splits it into separate articles, invoking <u>prog</u>...
       on each, with the article avaiable on descriptor 0.  This is useful as a quick-and-dirty way of filtering
       an article stream.

       The incoming article stream is expected to be in wire format, with lines ending  in  CRLF,  leading  dots
       doubled, and delimited by a dot on a line by itself.

       The  article presented to <u>prog</u>...  will have lines that end in a bare newline, will have all header lines
       unfolded, leading dots will be unstuffed, and the article will be terminated by end-of-file.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>prog</u>...
              is the program (with arguments) to run on each article.   If  <u>prog</u>...   exits  with  any  kind  of
              failure, <b>snsplit</b> aborts.

       <u>field</u>...-
              are  optional  header field names.  If these are specified, the value of the first header field of
              that name will be exported into the environment.  This <u>field</u>...  list must be  terminated  by  the
              hyphen.  See also <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>r</b>     Expect input articles in rnews batch format instead.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>snsplit</b>  sets some environment variables.  If the environment already contains these variables, they will
       be overwritten.

       <b>SEQUENCE</b>
              If already set to a positive value, it is incremented for the first article.  If it isn't set,  is
              set  to one for the first article.  Thereafter it is incremented for each subsequent article.  The
              value is always a 6-digit number with leading zeroes, and it can roll over.

       <b>BYTES</b>  contains the size of the current article.

       <b>HEAD_LINES</b>
              The number of lines in the head of the article, excluding the blank separator line.

       <b>BODY_LINES</b>
              The number of lines in the body of the article, excluding the blank separator line.

       <b>FLD_</b><u>FIELD</u>
              If any <u>field</u>s are specified on the command line, where <u>field</u> is the  name  of  an  article  header
              field, then <b>FLD_</b><u>FIELD</u> will be set to the value of <u>field</u>, where <u>FIELD</u> is the same as <u>field</u> but with
              lower  case  characters changed to upper case, and all hyphens changed to underscores.  Confusing?
              If <u>field</u> is <b>message-id</b>, then <b>FLD_MESSAGE_ID</b> will be set to the value of the first Message-ID field
              in the current article, if there is one.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>snsplit</b> exits 0 on success, 1 on usage error, 2 on system error, and  3  on  article  format  error.   If
       <u>prog</u>...  exits with other than 0, <b>snsplit</b> will also exit that value.

N.B.                                               Harold Tay                                  <u>snsplit,<a href="../man8/v0.3.8.8.html">v0.3.8</a></u>(8)
