</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       snsend - distribute articles
       snstore - store articles locally

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>snsend</b> [-<u>rvcna</u>]
       <b>snstore</b> [-<u>rvcna</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>snsend</b>  reads articles from descriptor 0 and distributes each one into each newsgroup they are posted to,
       like <b>inews</b>.  <b>snstore</b> does the same but stores them all locally.  The input articles are expected to be in
       wire format (lines end with CRLF, leading dots are doubled, and articles are terminated with a lone dot).

       Control messages are not treated specially.

       The newsgroups list is taken from the <b>X-sn-Newsgroups</b> field if it exists; otherwise it is taken from  the
       <b>Newsgroups</b>  field,  which must exist or the article will be <b>junked</b>.  All fields whose names begin with <b>X-</b>
       <b>sn-</b> (case insensitive) are always removed.

       If <b>Date</b> or <b>Message-ID</b> are not present, these are created.  The local hosts name is prepended to the  <b>Path</b>
       field.

       If an article is to be <b>junked</b>, it is sent to the junk newsgroup if it exists, otherwise it is discarded.

</pre><h4><b>ROUTING</b></h4><pre>
       This applies only to <b>snsend</b>.  <b>snstore</b> does not route; it treats all <u>news.groups</u> as though they were local
       (see <b>Nonexistent</b> <b>newsgroup</b> and <b>Local</b> <b>newsgroup</b> below).  If any of the following fails, <b>snsend</b> aborts:

       For  each  <u>news.group</u> an article is (cross-) posted to, <b>snsend</b> routes the article as follows, aborting if
       any action fails:

       <b>Nonexistent</b> <b>newsgroup</b>
              If  /var/spool/sn/<u>news.group</u>  is  not  a  directory,  <b>snsend</b>  ignores  this  <u>news.group</u>.   If  all
              <u>news.group</u>s are thus ignored, the article is <b>junked</b>.

       <b>Global</b> <b>newsgroup</b>
              If  /var/spool/sn/<u>news.group</u>/.outgoing  is  a  (symlink to a) directory, <b>snsend</b> stores the article
              into a file in that directory, if the same article does not already exist there  (so  <u>news.group</u>'s
              upstream feed doesn't get multiple copies of the same article.)  Such in-transit article files are
              given names that begin with a <b>$</b> sign.

       <b>Local</b> <b>processing</b> <b>via</b> <b>script</b>
              Otherwise  if  /var/spool/sn/<u>news.group</u>/.outgoing is a regular file, it is taken to be a script or
              program and is run with the article available on its input.  See /var/spool/sn/<b>dot-outgoing.ex</b>.

       <b>Local</b> <b>processing</b> <b>via</b> <b>fifo</b>
              Otherwise if /var/spool/sn/<u>news.group</u>/.outgoing is a fifo, the article is written into it.  It  is
              an error if nothing is reading the fifo.

       <b>Local</b> <b>newsgroup</b>
              Otherwise  if  /var/spool/sn/<u>news.group</u>/.outgoing  does  not  exist,  the  article  is stored into
              <u>news.group</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options apply to <b>snsend</b> and <b>snstore</b> equally.

       -<b>r</b>     The article stream is in rnews batch format, rather than wire format.  Only the <b>#!</b> <b>rnews</b>  form  is
              understood.

       -<b>c</b>     If an article already exists in the local newsgroup it is destined for, don't store it there.  For
              <b>snsend</b>, this option has no effect on newsgroups that are not local.

       -<b>a</b>     (Aliases  not allowed.)  When storing to multiple local newsgroups, do not alias subsequent copies
              to the first, instead, make a copy.  Aliasing saves disk space, but when the original expires,  so
              do all aliases to it.  This option has no effect on newsgroups that are not local.

       -<b>n</b>     Don't actually do anything with the article, just dump it back onto descriptor 1.

       -<b>v</b>     For  each  article  stored in each newsgroup, output a line to descriptor 1 similar to what <b>snscan</b>
              would emit, except that for non-local newsgroups the serial number will always be 0.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /var/spool/sn/<u>news.group.name</u>/
              This includes /var/spool/sn/<b>=junk</b> newsgroup if it exists.   Each  such  directory  represents  the
              newsgroup  of the same name, and articles are stored in files <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, etc. beneath it.  Each such
              file  contains  1  or  more  articles.   This   is   contrary   to   the   traditional   form   of
              /var/spool/sn/<u>news</u>/<u>group</u>/<u>name</u>.  <u>news.group.name</u>.

       /var/spool/sn/<u>news.group</u>/.outgoing
              See  also  <b>ROUTING</b> above.  The presence of this directory indicates that <u>news.group</u> is global, and
              articles posted to <u>news.group</u> end up here in files named <b>$</b>*.  These files are  linked  in  already
              complete, so all such files are ready to be uploaded.

       /var/spool/sn/<u>news.group</u>/.compress
              If this file exists, articles stored in <u>news.group</u> are candidates for compression.  The content of
              the  file  is  a  number representing a minimum article body size below which compression won't be
              applied.  If the file is empty this threshold defaults to 1024 bytes.

       /var/spool/sn/<b>.me</b>
              If this file exists, it's contents are taken to be the local hosts name for purposes of  the  <b>Path</b>
              field.  Otherwise the name is obtained from <b><a href="../man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname</a></b>(2).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       See also <a href="file:/usr/sbin/">/usr/sbin/</a><b>dot-outgoing.ex</b> for other variables exported when <b>snsend</b> invokes a .outgoing program.

       <b>SNROOT</b> If this is set, its value is used in place of /var/spool/sn.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>snsend</b> and <b>snstore</b> exit 0 on success, 1 on usage error, 2 on system error, 3 on article format error, and
       9 if /var/spool/sn/<u>news.group</u>/.outgoing (<b>snsend</b> only) exits with other than 0.
