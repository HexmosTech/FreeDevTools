</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ipmiconsole - IPMI console utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ipmiconsole</b> [<u>OPTION</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ipmiconsole</b>  is  a Serial-over-LAN (SOL) console utility. It can be used to establish console sessions to
       remote machines using the IPMI 2.0 SOL  protocol.   <b>Ipmiconsole</b>  communicates  with  a  remote  machine's
       Baseboard  Management  Controller  (BMC) to establish a console session. Before any SOL communication can
       take place, the remote machine's BMC must be configured properly.  The FreeIPMI tool  <b><a href="../man8/ipmi-config.8.html">ipmi-config</a>(8)</b>  may
       be used to do this configuration.

       Often  (although  not always), console redirection must be also be configured properly in the BIOS and/or
       operating system. Both must be configured to redirect console  traffic  out  the  appropriate  COM  port.
       Please see your motherboard and OS documentation for instructions on proper setup.

       Listed  below  are  general IPMI options, tool specific options, trouble shooting information, workaround
       information, examples, and known issues. For a general introduction to FreeIPMI please see <b><a href="../man7/freeipmi.7.html">freeipmi</a>(7).</b>

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are general options for configuring IPMI communication and executing  general  tool
       commands.

       <b>-h</b> <u>IPMIHOST,</u> <b>--hostname</b>=<u>IPMIHOST[:PORT]</u>
              Specify  the  remote  host  to  communicate  with. An optional port can be specified, which may be
              useful in port forwarding or similar situations. If specifying an IPv6 address and port,  use  the
              format [ADDRESS]:PORT.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--username</b>=<u>USERNAME</u>
              Specify  the  username  to use when authenticating with the remote host.  If not specified, a null
              (i.e. anonymous) username is assumed. The user must a high enough privilege  to  establish  a  SOL
              session and have SOL session abilities.

       <b>-p</b> <u>PASSWORD</u>, <b>--password</b>=<u>PASSWORD</u>
              Specify  the  password to use when authenticationg with the remote host.  If not specified, a null
              password is assumed. Maximum password length is 16 for IPMI 1.5 and 20 for IPMI 2.0.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--password-prompt</b>
              Prompt for password to avoid possibility of listing it in process lists.

       <b>-k</b> <u>K_G</u>, <b>--k-g</b>=<u>K_G</u>
              Specify the K_g BMC key to use when authenticating with the remote  host  for  IPMI  2.0.  If  not
              specified,  a  null  key  is assumed. To input the key in hexadecimal form, prefix the string with
              '0x'. E.g., the key 'abc' can be entered with the either the string 'abc' or the string '0x616263'

       <b>-K</b>, <b>--k-g-prompt</b>
              Prompt for k-g to avoid possibility of listing it in process lists.

       <b>--session-timeout</b>=<u>MILLISECONDS</u>
              Specify the session timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 60000 milliseconds (60  seconds)  if  not
              specified.

       <b>--retransmission-timeout</b>=<u>MILLISECONDS</u>
              Specify  the  packet  retransmission  timeout  in  milliseconds. Defaults to 500 milliseconds (0.5
              seconds) if not specified.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--cipher-suite-id</b>=<u>CIPHER-SUITE-ID</u>
              Specify the IPMI  2.0  cipher  suite  ID  to  use.  The  Cipher  Suite  ID  identifies  a  set  of
              authentication,  integrity,  and confidentiality algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0 communication. The
              authentication algorithm identifies  the  algorithm  to  use  for  session  setup,  the  integrity
              algorithm  identifies  the algorithm to use for session packet signatures, and the confidentiality
              algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher suite ID 3 if
              not specified. The user should be aware that only cipher suite ids 3, 8, and  12  encrypt  console
              payloads.  Console  information  will  be  sent  in  the  clear if an alternate cipher suite id is
              selected. The following cipher suite ids are currently supported:

              0 - Authentication Algorithm = None; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None

              1 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm  =
              None

              2  -  Authentication  Algorithm  =  HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality
              Algorithm = None

              3 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1;  Integrity  Algorithm  =  HMAC-SHA1-96;  Confidentiality
              Algorithm = AES-CBC-128

              6  -  Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm =
              None

              7 - Authentication Algorithm =  HMAC-MD5;  Integrity  Algorithm  =  HMAC-MD5-128;  Confidentiality
              Algorithm = None

              8  -  Authentication  Algorithm  =  HMAC-MD5;  Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality
              Algorithm = AES-CBC-128

              11 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm
              = None

              12 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm
              = AES-CBC-128

              15 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA256; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm
              = None

              16  -  Authentication  Algorithm   =   HMAC-SHA256;   Integrity   Algorithm   =   HMAC_SHA256_128;
              Confidentiality Algorithm = None

              17   -   Authentication   Algorithm   =   HMAC-SHA256;   Integrity  Algorithm  =  HMAC_SHA256_128;
              Confidentiality Algorithm = AES-CBC-128

       <b>-l</b> <u>PRIVILEGE-LEVEL</u>, <b>--privilege-level</b>=<u>PRIVILEGE-LEVEL</u>
              Specify the privilege level to be  used.  The  currently  available  privilege  levels  are  USER,
              OPERATOR, and ADMIN. Defaults to ADMIN if not specified.

       <b>--config-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Specify an alternate configuration file.

       <b>-W</b> <u>WORKAROUNDS</u>, <b>--workaround-flags</b>=<u>WORKAROUNDS</u>
              Specify  workarounds  to vendor compliance issues. Multiple workarounds can be specified separated
              by commas. A special command line flag of "none", will indicate no workarounds (may be useful  for
              overriding configured defaults). See WORKAROUNDS below for a list of available workarounds.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Turn on debugging.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Output a help list and exit.

       <b>--usage</b>
              Output a usage message and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Output the program version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>IPMICONSOLE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are specific to <b>ipmiconsole.</b>

       <b>-e</b> <u>CHAR</u>, <b>--escape-char</b>=<u>CHAR</u>
              Specify an alternate escape character (default char '&amp;').

       <b>--dont-steal</b>
              Do  not steal an SOL session if one is already detected as being in use. Under most circumstances,
              if SOL is detected as being in use, <b>ipmiconsole</b> will attempt to steal the SOL  session  away  from
              the previous session.  This default behavior exists for several reasons, most notably that earlier
              SOL sessions may have not been able to be deactivate properly.

       <b>--deactivate</b>
              Deactivate SOL session if one is detected as being in use and exit.

       <b>--serial-keepalive</b>
              Occasionally   send  NUL  characters  to  detect  inactive  serial  connections.  This  option  is
              particularly useful for those who intend to run <b>ipmiconsole</b> without much interaction, such as  for
              logging purposes. While IPMI connections may still be alive, some motherboards have exhibited bugs
              in which underlying serial data can no longer be sent/received. From the viewpoint of <b>ipmiconsole,</b>
              data  is  simply not be sent out of the remote system and this problem is only detected once there
              is user interaction. By sending the occasional NUL character, the underlying loss of  serial  data
              transfer  can  be  detected  far  more  quickly.  There  is some risk with this option, as the NUL
              character byte may affect the remote system depending on what data it may or may not be expecting.
              For example, a NUL character received by <b><a href="../man8/getty.8.html">getty</a>(8)</b> and its descendants  (such  as  <b><a href="../man8/agetty.8.html">agetty</a>(8))</b>  will
              cause a baud rate change, which may lock up the terminal.

       <b>--serial-keepalive-empty</b>
              This  option  is  identical  to  <b>--serial-keepalive</b>  except  that  SOL packets will contain no NUL
              character data. On some motherboards, this may be sufficient to deal with a hanging  IPMI  session
              without the risk of regularly sending a NUL character byte may have. However, some systems may not
              ACK a SOL packet without character data in it, meaning these keepalive packets do nothing.

       <b>--sol-payload-instance</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              Specify  the SOL payload instance number. The default value is 1, valid values range from 1 to 15.
              Most systems only support a single instance, however a few allow users to access multiple.

       <b>--deactivate-all-instances</b>
              When used along with the <b>--deactivate</b> option, will deactivate all active SOL instances instead  of
              just the currently configured payload instance.

       <b>--lock-memory</b>
              Lock sensitive information (such as usernames and passwords) in memory.

</pre><h4><b>ESCAPE</b> <b>CHARACTERS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  escape sequences are supported. The default supported escape character is '&amp;', but can be
       changed with the <b>-e</b> option.

       <u>&amp;?</u>     Display a list of currently available escape sequences.

       <u>&amp;.</u>     Terminate the connection.

       <u>&amp;B</u>     Send a "serial-break" to the remote console.

       <u>&amp;D</u>     Send a DEL character.

       <u>&amp;&amp;</u>     Send a single escape character.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       Most often, IPMI problems are due to configuration problems.

       IPMI over LAN problems involve a misconfiguration of the remote machine's BMC.  Double check to make sure
       the following are configured properly in the remote machine's BMC: IP address, MAC address, subnet  mask,
       username,  user  enablement,  user  privilege,  password,  LAN  privilege,  LAN  enablement,  and allowed
       authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0 connections, double check to make sure the cipher suite privilege(s)
       and K_g key are configured properly. The <b><a href="../man8/ipmi-config.8.html">ipmi-config</a>(8)</b> tool can be used to  check  and/or  change  these
       configuration settings.

       In  addition  to  the  troubleshooting  tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below to also if there are any
       vendor specific bugs that have been discovered and worked around.

       Listed below are many of the common issues for error messages.  For additional support, please e-mail the
       &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt; mailing list.

       "username invalid" - The username entered (or a NULL username if none was entered) is  not  available  on
       the remote machine. It may also be possible the remote BMC's username configuration is incorrect.

       "password invalid" - The password entered (or a NULL password if none was entered) is not correct. It may
       also be possible the password for the user is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "password  verification  timeout"  -  Password  verification  has  timed out.  A "password invalid" error
       (described above) or a generic "session timeout" (described below) occurred.  During this  point  in  the
       protocol it cannot be differentiated which occurred.

       "k_g  invalid"  - The K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was entered) is not correct. It may also
       be possible the K_g key is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "privilege level insufficient" -  An  IPMI  command  requires  a  higher  user  privilege  than  the  one
       authenticated  with.  Please try to authenticate with a higher privilege. This may require authenticating
       to a different user which has a higher maximum privilege.

       "privilege level cannot be obtained  for  this  user"  -  The  privilege  level  you  are  attempting  to
       authenticate  with  is  higher  than  the  maximum  allowed  for this user. Please try again with a lower
       privilege. It may also be possible the maximum privilege level allowed  for  a  user  is  not  configured
       properly on the remote BMC.

       "authentication  type  unavailable  for  attempted privilege level" - The authentication type you wish to
       authenticate with is not available  for  this  privilege  level.  Please  try  again  with  an  alternate
       authentication  type  or  alternate privilege level. It may also be possible the available authentication
       types you can authenticate with are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "cipher suite id unavailable" - The cipher suite id you wish to authenticate with is not available on the
       remote BMC. Please try again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may also  be  possible  the  available
       cipher suite ids are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "ipmi  2.0  unavailable"  - IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote machine. Please try to use IPMI 1.5
       instead.

       "connection timeout" - Initial IPMI communication failed. A number  of  potential  errors  are  possible,
       including  an  invalid  hostname specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be resolved, IPMI is not enabled on
       the remote server, the network connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration and connectivity.

       "session timeout" - The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect.  If this error  occurs  often,  you
       may wish to increase the retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are considerably slower than others.

       "internal  IPMI  error" - An IPMI error has occurred that FreeIPMI does not know how to handle. Please e-
       mail &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt; to report the issue.

</pre><h4><b>IPMICONSOLE</b> <b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       The following are common issues for error messages in <b>ipmiconsole.</b>

       "SOL unavailable" - SOL is not configured for use on the remote BMC.  It may be not configured in general
       or for the specific user specified. Authenticating with a different user may be sufficient,  however  the
       IPMI protocol does not reveal detail on what is not configured on the remote BMC.

       "SOL  in  use"  - SOL is already in use on the remote BMC. If you do not specify the <u>--dont-steal</u> option,
       <b>ipmiconsole</b> will attempt to steal the SOL session away from the other session. Not all BMCs  support  the
       ability to steal away a SOL session.

       "SOL session stolen" - Your SOL session has been stolen by another session. You may wish to try and steal
       the session back by reconnecting.

       "SOL  requires  encryption"  - SOL requires a cipher suite id that includes encryption. Please try to use
       cipher suite id 3, 8, or 12.  It may also be possible the  encryption  requirements  are  not  configured
       correctly on the remote BMC.

       "SOL requires no encryption" - SOL requires a cipher suite id that does not use encryption. Please try to
       use  cipher  suite  id  0, 1, 2, 6, 7, or 11. It may also be possible the encryption requirements are not
       configured correctly on the remote BMC.

       "BMC Implementation" - The BMC on the remote machine has a severe problem in its  implementation.  Please
       see  the  WORKAROUNDS  section  below  for  possible  workarounds.  If  additional vendor workarounds are
       required, please contact the authors.

       "excess retransmissions sent" - An excessive number of retransmissions of SOL packets  has  occurred  and
       <b>ipmiconsole</b>  has  given  up.  This  may  be  due to network issues or SOL issues. Some of the same issues
       involved with "connection timeout" or "session timeout" errors may be involved.  Please try to reconnect.

       "excess errors received" - An excessive number of SOL packet errors  has  occurred  and  <b>ipmiconsole</b>  has
       given up. This may be due to network issues or SOL issues.  Please try to reconnect.

       "BMC  Error"  -  This  error  usually  means  a  vendor  SOL  implementation  requires  a  combination of
       authentication, encryption, privilege, etc. that have not been met by the user's choices.  Please  try  a
       combination  of  different  cipher  suites,  privileges,  etc.  to  resolve  the  problem. Please see the
       WORKAROUNDS section below for possible workarounds too.

</pre><h4><b>WORKAROUNDS</b></h4><pre>
       With so many different vendors implementing their own IPMI solutions,  different  vendors  may  implement
       their  IPMI protocols incorrectly. The following describes a number of workarounds currently available to
       handle discovered compliance issues. When possible, workarounds have been implemented  so  they  will  be
       transparent  to  the user. However, some will require the user to specify a workaround be used via the -W
       option.

       The hardware listed below may only indicate the hardware that a problem was discovered on. Newer versions
       of hardware may fix the problems indicated below. Similar machines from vendors may or  may  not  exhibit
       the same problems. Different vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI firmware developer, so
       it may be worthwhile to try workarounds listed below even if your motherboard is not listed.

       If  you  believe  your  hardware  has  an  additional  compliance  issue  that  needs  a workaround to be
       implemented,   please   contact    the    FreeIPMI    maintainers    on    &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt;    or
       &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-devel@gnu.org">freeipmi-devel@gnu.org</a>&gt;.

       <u>authcap</u>  -  This  workaround  flag  will  skip  early  checks  for  username capabilities, authentication
       capabilities, and K_g support and allow IPMI authentication to succeed. It works around  multiple  issues
       in  which  the remote system does not properly report username capabilities, authentication capabilities,
       or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may see "username invalid", "authentication type unavailable  for
       attempted  privilege  level",  or "k_g invalid" errors.  Issue observed on Asus P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4,
       Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.

       <u>nochecksumcheck</u> - This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the checksums returned  from  IPMI
       command  responses.  It  works around systems that return invalid checksums due to implementation errors,
       but the packet is otherwise valid. Users are  cautioned  on  the  use  of  this  option,  as  it  removes
       validation  of  packet  integrity in a number of circumstances. However, it is unlikely to be an issue in
       most situations. Those hitting this issue may see "connection timeout", "session timeout",  or  "password
       verification  timeout"  errors. On IPMI 1.5 connections, the "noauthcodecheck" workaround may also needed
       too. Issue observed on Supermicro X9SCM-iiF, Supermicro X9DRi-F, and Supermicro X9DRFR.

       <u>intel20</u> - This workaround flag will work around several Intel IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The  issues
       covered  include  padding  of usernames, and password truncation if the authentication algorithm is HMAC-
       MD5-128. Those hitting this issue may see  "username  invalid",  "password  invalid",  or  "k_g  invalid"
       errors. Issue observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module (Professional Edition).

       <u>supermicro20</u> - This workaround flag will work around several Supermicro IPMI 2.0 authentication issues on
       motherboards   w/   Peppercon   IPMI  firmware.  The  issues  covered  include  handling  invalid  length
       authentication codes. Those hitting this issue may see "password  invalid"  errors.   Issue  observed  on
       Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card. Confirmed fixed on newerver firmware.

       <u>sun20</u> - This workaround flag will work work around several Sun IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The issues
       covered  include  invalid  lengthed  hash keys, improperly hashed keys, and invalid cipher suite records.
       Those hitting this issue may see "password invalid" or "bmc error" errors.  Issue observed  on  Sun  Fire
       4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.  This workaround automatically includes the "opensesspriv" workaround.

       <u>opensesspriv</u>  -  This  workaround  flag  will  slightly  alter FreeIPMI's IPMI 2.0 connection protocol to
       workaround an invalid hashing algorithm used by the remote system. The privilege level  sent  during  the
       Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0 connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege level sent
       during  the  RAKP1  connection stage. Those hitting this issue may see "password invalid", "k_g invalid",
       "bad rmcpplus status code", or "privilege level cannot be obtained for this user" errors.  Issue observed
       on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Supermicro X8DTH,  Supermicro  X8DTG,
       Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN, Dell C5220,
       and the OpenIPMI software BMC. This workaround is automatically triggered with the "sun20" workaround.

       <u>integritycheckvalue</u>  -  This  workaround flag will work around an invalid integrity check value during an
       IPMI 2.0 session establishment when using Cipher Suite ID 0.  The  integrity  check  value  should  be  0
       length,  however the remote motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting this issue may see
       "k_g invalid" errors. Issue observed on Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU,  and  Intel  S5500WBV/Penguin
       Relion 700, and Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X.

       <u>solpayloadsize</u> - This workaround flag will not check for valid SOL payload sizes and assume a proper set.
       It  works  around remote systems that report invalid IPMI 2.0 SOL payload sizes. Those hitting this issue
       may see "BMC Implementation" errors. Issue observed  on  Asus  P5M2/RS162-E4/RX4,  Intel  SR1520ML/X38ML,
       Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Sun x4100, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, and Quanta
       QSSC-S4R//Appro GB812X-CN.

       <u>solport</u>  -  This  workaround flag will ignore alternate SOL ports specified during the protocol. It works
       around remote systems that report  invalid  alternate  SOL  ports.  Those  hitting  this  issue  may  see
       "connection timeout" errors. Issue observed on Asus P5MT-R and Supermicro X8DTH-iF.

       <u>solstatus</u>  - This workaround flag will not check the current activation status of SOL during the protocol
       setup. It works around remote systems that do not properly support this command. Those hitting this issue
       may see "BMC Error" errors. Issue observed on Supermicro X8SIL-F.

       <u>solchannelsupport</u> - This workaround flag will not check if SOL is supported on the  current  channel.  It
       works  around  remote systems that do not properly support this command. Those hitting this issue may see
       "BMC Error" errors. Issue observed on Intel Windmill, Quanta Winterfell, and Wiwynn Windmill

       <u>serialalertsdeferred</u> - This workaround option will set serial alerts to be deferred instead of have  them
       be  failures.  This  works  around motherboards that perform IPMI over serial along with IPMI serial over
       LAN. Those hitting this issue may see "excess retransmissions sent" when they attempt to input  data  via
       SOL.  Issue observed on Intel Windmill, Quanta Winterfell, and Wiwynn Windmill.

       <u>solpacketseq</u>  -  This  workaround option will increment the SOL payload packet sequence number under dire
       circumstances. Normally SOL should never do this, however some motherboards have shown to get "stuck" due
       to an internal bug on the motherboard. This workaround can  help  in  getting  the  BMC  un-stuck.  Those
       hitting  this  issue may see "excess retransmissions sent" when they attempt to input data via SOL. Issue
       observed on Intel Windmill, Quanta Winterfell, and Wiwynn Windmill.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       On older operating systems, if you input your username, password, and other potentially security relevant
       information on the command line, this information may be discovered by other users when using tools  like
       the  <b><a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a>(1)</b>  command  or  looking  in the <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> file system. It is generally more secure to input password
       information with options like the -P or -K options. Configuring  security  relevant  information  in  the
       FreeIPMI configuration file would also be an appropriate way to hide this information.

       In  order  to  prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will temporarily "lock up" after a number of remote
       authentication errors. You may need to wait awhile in order to this temporary "lock up"  to  pass  before
       you may authenticate again.

       Some  motherboards  define  an OEM SOL inactivity timeout for SOL sessions. If SOL sessions stay inactive
       for long periods of time, <b>ipmiconsole</b> sessions may be abruptly closed, most likely resulting  in  session
       timeout errors. Please see OEM notes for information on modifying this parameter if you wish for sessions
       to stay active longer.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>HARDWARE</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Intel  SR1520ML/X38ML:  After  a reboot, the SOL session appears to "disconnect" from the motherboard but
       stay alive.  Character data input from the <b>ipmiconsole</b> client is accepted by the remote machine,  but  no
       character data or console data is ever sent back from the remote machine. The SOL session is subsequently
       useless.  There  is  currently  no  workaround  in  place  to handle this. The session must be closed and
       restarted.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#</b> <b>ipmiconsole</b> <b>-h</b> <b>ahost</b> <b>-u</b> <b>myusername</b> <b>-p</b> <b>mypassword</b>

       Establish a console session with a remote host.
