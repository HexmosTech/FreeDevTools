       mariadbd - the MariaDB server (mysqld is now a symlink to mariadbd)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>mysqld</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mysqld</b>, also known as MariaDB Server, is the main program that does most of the work in a MariaDB
       installation. MariaDB Server manages access to the MariaDB data directory that contains databases and
       tables. The data directory is also the default location for other information such as log files and
       status files.

       When MariaDB server starts, it listens for network connections from client programs and manages access to
       databases on behalf of those clients.

       The <b>mysqld</b> program has many options that can be specified at startup. For a complete list of options, run
       this command:

           shell&gt; <b>mysqld</b> <b>--verbose</b> <b>--help</b>

       MariaDB Server also has a set of system variables that affect its operation as it runs. System variables
       can be set at server startup, and many of them can be changed at runtime to effect dynamic server
       reconfiguration. MariaDB Server also has a set of status variables that provide information about its
       operation. You can monitor these status variables to access runtime performance characteristics.

       For a full description of MariaDB Server command options, system variables, and status variables, see the
       MariaDB Knowledge Base.
