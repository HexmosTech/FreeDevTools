</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pam_access - PAM module for logdaemon style login access control

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>pam_access.so</b> [debug] [noaudit] [nodefgroup] [nodns] [quiet_log] [accessfile=<u>file</u>] [fieldsep=<u>sep</u>]
                     [listsep=<u>sep</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The pam_access PAM module is mainly for access management. It provides logdaemon style login access
       control based on login names, host or domain names, internet addresses or network numbers, or on terminal
       line names, X <u>$DISPLAY</u> values, or PAM service names in case of non-networked logins.

       By default rules for access management are taken from config file <a href="file:/etc/security/access.conf">/etc/security/access.conf</a> if you don't
       specify another file. Then individual *.conf files from the /etc/security/access.d/ directory are read.
       The files are parsed one after another in the order of the system locale. The effect of the individual
       files is the same as if all the files were concatenated together in the order of parsing. This means that
       once a pattern is matched in some file no further files are parsed. If a config file is explicitly
       specified with the <b>accessfile</b> option the files in the above directory are not parsed.

       If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will report when it denies access based on origin
       (host, tty, etc.).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       accessfile=/path/to/access.conf
           Indicate an alternative access.conf style configuration file to override the default. This can be
           useful when different services need different access lists.

       debug
           A lot of debug information is printed with <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3).

       noaudit
           Do not report logins from disallowed hosts and ttys to the audit subsystem.

       nodefgroup
           User tokens which are not enclosed in parentheses will not be matched against the group database. The
           backwards compatible default is to try the group database match even for tokens not enclosed in
           parentheses.

       nodns
           Do not try to resolve tokens as hostnames, only IPv4 and IPv6 addresses will be resolved. Which means
           to allow login from a remote host, the IP addresses need to be specified in access.conf.

       quiet_log
           Do not log denials with <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3).

       fieldsep=separators
           This option modifies the field separator character that pam_access will recognize when parsing the
           access configuration file. For example: <b>fieldsep=|</b> will cause the default `:' character to be treated
           as part of a field value and `|' becomes the field separator. Doing this may be useful in conjunction
           with a system that wants to use pam_access with X based applications, since the <b>PAM_TTY</b> item is
           likely to be of the form "hostname:0" which includes a `:' character in its value. But you should not
           need this.

       listsep=separators
           This option modifies the list separator character that pam_access will recognize when parsing the
           access configuration file. For example: <b>listsep=,</b> will cause the default ` ' (space) and `\t' (tab)
           characters to be treated as part of a list element value and `,' becomes the only list element
           separator. Doing this may be useful on a system with group information obtained from a Windows
           domain, where the default built-in groups "Domain Users", "Domain Admins" contain a space.

</pre><h4><b>MODULE</b> <b>TYPES</b> <b>PROVIDED</b></h4><pre>
       All module types (<b>auth</b>, <b>account</b>, <b>password</b> and <b>session</b>) are provided.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       PAM_SUCCESS
           Access was granted.

       PAM_PERM_DENIED
           Access was not granted.

       PAM_IGNORE
           <b>pam_setcred</b> was called which does nothing.

       PAM_ABORT
           Not all relevant data or options could be gotten.

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
           The user is not known to the system.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/etc/security/access.conf">/etc/security/access.conf</a>

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The logdaemon style login access control scheme was designed and implemented by Wietse Venema. The
       pam_access PAM module was developed by Alexei Nogin &lt;<a href="mailto:alexei@nogin.dnttm.ru">alexei@nogin.dnttm.ru</a>&gt;. The IPv6 support and the
       network(address) / netmask feature was developed and provided by Mike Becher
       &lt;<a href="mailto:mike.becher@lrz-muenchen.de">mike.becher@lrz-muenchen.de</a>&gt;.
