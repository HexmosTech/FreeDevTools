</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  utility  sends  a SCSI LOG SENSE command to the <u>DEVICE</u> and then outputs the response. The LOG SENSE
       command is used to fetch log pages which, if known, are decoded  by  default.  When  the  <u>--reset</u>  and/or
       <u>--select</u>  option  is  given  then a SCSI LOG SELECT command is issued to the <u>DEVICE</u>. Alternatively one or
       more log page responses can be in a file read using the <u>--inhex=FN</u> option; in this case  those  responses
       are decoded and the <u>DEVICE</u> argument, if given, is ignored.

       In  SPC-4 revision 5 the subpage code was introduced to both the LOG SENSE and LOG SELECT command. At the
       same time a page code field was introduced to the to the LOG SELECT command. The  log  subpage  code  can
       range from 0 to 255 (0xff) inclusive. The subpage code value 255 can be thought of as a wildcard.

       The  SYNOPSIS section above is divided into five forms. The first form shows the options that can be used
       to send a LOG SENSE command to the <u>DEVICE</u> and decode its response. The second form fetches  data  from  a
       file  (named  <u>FN</u>)  and decodes it as if it were a response from a LOG SENSE command. The third form shows
       the options that can be used to send a LOG SELECT command. The  fourth  form  groups  various  management
       options.   The  last  form  shows  the  older,  deprecated command line interface which is maintained for
       backward compatibility.

       When no options are given, just a <u>DEVICE</u>, that is equivalent to calling  this  utility  with  the  <u>--list</u>
       option. In that case the names of the supported log pages (but not subpages) are listed out.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments  to  long  options  are  mandatory  for  short  options  as  well.  The options are arranged in
       alphabetical order based on the long option name.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--ALL</b>
              fetch and decode all the log pages and subpages supported by the  <u>DEVICE</u>.   This  requires  a  two
              stage  process:  first  the  "supported log pages and subpages" log page is fetched, then for each
              entry in its response, the corresponding log page (or subpage) is fetched and displayed. Note that
              there are many SCSI devices that do not support LOG SENSE subpages and respond to this option with
              an illegal request sense key. In this case this utility continues by fetching  the  supported  log
              pages  log  page instead. In other words if the <u>--ALL</u> option fails then the <u>--all</u> is used instead.
              The reason is that almost certainly the <u>DEVICE</u> does not have any log subpages to report.
              To force an error if the fetch of the supported log pages and subpages log page fails use both the
              <u>--ALL</u> and <u>--full</u> options.
              Since some vendors don't list all log pages in the "supported log pages and  subpages"  log  page,
              the  '-lll'  option can be given in addition. This will merge both "supported ..." log pages then,
              from that resultant merged list, fetch page contents.
              This option overrides the <u>--page=PG</u> if the latter is also given.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
              outputs all the log pages supported by the <u>DEVICE</u>. This requires a two stage  process:  first  the
              "supported  log pages" log page is fetched, then for each entry in its response, the corresponding
              log page is fetched and displayed. When used twice (e.g. '-aa') all log  pages  and  subpages  are
              fetched.
              This option overrides the <u>--page=PG</u> if the latter is also given.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--brief</b>
              shorten  the amount of output for some log pages. For example the Tape Alert log page only outputs
              parameters whose flags are set when <u>--brief</u> is given.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--control</b>=<u>PC</u>
              accepts 0, 1, 2 or 3 for the <u>PC</u> argument:
                  <b>0</b> : current threshold values
                  <b>1</b> : current cumulative values
                  <b>2</b> : default threshold values
                  <b>3</b> : default cumulative values
              The default value is 1 (i.e. current cumulative values).

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--enumerate</b>
              this option is used to output information held in this utility's internal tables about  known  log
              pages  including  their  name,  acronym and fields. If given, the <u>DEVICE</u> argument is ignored. When
              given once (e.g. '-e') all known pages are listed, sorted in ascending alphabetical acronym order.
              When given twice, vendor pages are excluded.  When given three times, all known pages are  listed,
              sorted  in  ascending  numeric order listed; when given four times, vendor pages are excluded from
              the numeric order.
              The <u>--filter=FL</u> and <u>--verbose</u> options reduce the output of the enumeration.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--exclude</b>
              this option excludes vendor specific pages and parameters  from  the  output.   Trying  to  decode
              vendor  specific pages and parameters does not necessarily work well for many reasons. This option
              limits the output to pages and parameters defined by T10.
              Only parameter fields identified in the drafts as 'vendor specific' are  excluded.  So  parameters
              codes identified as 'reserved' are shown.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--filter</b>=<u>FL</u>
              <u>FL</u>  is  either a parameter code when <u>DEVICE</u> is given, or a peripheral device type (pdt) (or other)
              if <u>--enumerate</u> is given.
              In the parameter code case <u>FL</u> is a value between 0 and  65535  (0xffff)  and  only  the  parameter
              section  matching that code is output. If the <b>--hex</b> option is given the log parameter is output in
              hexadecimal rather than decoding it. If the <b>--hex</b> option is used twice then the leading address on
              each line of hex is removed. If the <b>--raw</b> option is given then the  log  parameter  is  output  in
              binary.  Most  log  pages  contain one or more log parameters. Examples of those that don't follow
              that convention are those pages that list supported log pages (and subpages).
              In the <u>--enumerate</u> case, when <u>FL</u> &gt;= zero it is taken as a pdt value and only log pages  associated
              with  that  pdt  plus generic pages listed in SPC are enumerated. If <u>FL</u> is -1 then the filter does
              nothing which is the same as not giving this option; when <u>FL</u> is -2 then only generic pages  listed
              in  SPC  are  enumerated.  If <u>FL</u> is -10 then only generic direct access like (e.g. disk) pages are
              enumerated. If <u>FL</u> is -11 then only generic tape like pages (e.g. includes ADC) are enumerated.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--full</b>
              this option is only used in two situations: with the Application client (AC) log page and with the
              <u>--ALL</u> option. Typically the AC log page has more than 16,000 bytes of user supplied  data.  Rather
              than print it all out, the default is to print out the first 64 bytes of data. When this option is
              given, the application client log pages is fully decoded.
              When both this option and the <u>--ALL</u> option are given, then this utility will exit with an error if
              the Supported log pages and subpages log page is not available.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              print out the usage message then exit.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b>
              The  default action is to decode known log page numbers (and subpage numbers) into text. When this
              option is used once, the response is output in hexadecimal. When used twice, each line of hex  has
              the ASCII equivalent shown to the right. When used three times, the hex has no leading address nor
              trailing ASCII making it suitable to be placed in a file (or piped). That file might later be used
              by another invocation using the <u>--inhex=FN</u> option.
              A weaker form of this option, called <u>--undefined</u>, handles the formatting of hexadecimal output for
              fields that this utility is unable to decode.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--in</b>=<u>FN</u>
              Same as <u>--inhex=FN</u> option. Kept for backward compatibility.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--inhex</b>=<u>FN</u>
              This  option  may be used in two different contexts. One is with the <u>--select</u> to send a LOG SELECT
              command to the given <u>DEVICE</u>; see the LOG SELECT section below.
              The other context is with no <u>DEVICE</u> argument given in which case the contents of <u>FN</u> are decoded as
              if it were the response of a LOG SENSE command (i.e. one or more log page). For decoding, the page
              and subpage numbers are taken from <u>FN</u> while the peripheral device type  is  either  generic  (i.e.
              from SPC) or the value given by <u>--pdt=DT</u>.
              <u>FN</u>  is  treated  as  a  file  name  (or  '-' for stdin) which contains ASCII hexadecimal or binary
              representing a log page. The hexadecimal should be arranged as 1 or 2 digits representing  a  byte
              each of which is whitespace or comma separated. Anything from and including a hash mark to the end
              of line is ignored. If the <u>--raw</u> option is also given then <u>FN</u> is treated as binary.

       <b>-j</b>[=<u>JO</u>], <b>--json</b>[=<u>JO</u>]
              output  is  in  JSON  format instead of plain text form. Note that arguments to the short and long
              form are themselves optional and if present start with "=" and no whitespace is  permitted  around
              that "=".
              See sg3_utils_json manpage or use '?' for <u>JO</u> to get a summary.

       <b>-J</b>, <b>--js-file</b>=<u>JFN</u>
              output  is  in  JSON  format  and  it  is sent to a file named <u>JFN</u>. If that file exists then it is
              truncated. By default, the JSON output is sent to stdout.
              When this option is given,  the  <u>--json[=JO]</u>  option  is  implied  and  need  not  be  given.  The
              <u>--json[=JO]</u> option may still be needed to set the <u>JO</u> parameter to non-default values.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
              lists  the  names  of  the  logs sense pages supported by this device. This is done by reading the
              "supported log pages" log page. When used once only log pages, but not subpages, are listed.  When
              used  twice  the  "supported  log pages and subpages" log page is output. Some vendors do not list
              some log pages (e.g. those without any subpages) in the "supported log  pages  and  subpages"  log
              page. To get a full inventory, this option can be used three times (e.g. '-lll') and the output of
              the  two  log  pages  is  merged.   Even if the "supported log pages and subpages" log page is not
              supported using this option three times will yield a list from the "supported log pages" log page.
              In the absence of other options, the page/subpage names, but not their contents,  are  shown  when
              this option is given.
              The  '-lll' form may be useful with the <u>--ALL</u> option to show the contents of all pages referred to
              in either the "supported log page" or the "supported log page and subpage" log pages.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--maxlen</b>=<u>LEN</u>
              sets the "allocation length" field in the LOG SENSE cdb. The is the maximum length in  bytes  that
              the  response  will  be.  Without this option (or <u>LEN</u> equal to 0) this utility first fetches the 4
              byte response then does a second access with the length indicated in the first (4 byte)  response.
              Negative  values and 1 for <u>LEN</u> are not accepted. Responses can be quite large (e.g. the background
              scan results log page) and this option can be used to limit the amount of information returned.
              The default <u>LEN</u> is 65532 unless the <u>--in=FN</u> option is given; in that case the default is 262144 .

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--name</b>
              decode some log pages into 'name=value' entries, one per line. The name contains no space and  may
              be  abbreviated  and the value is decimal unless prefixed by '0x'. Nesting is indicated by leading
              spaces. This form is meant to be relatively easy to parse.
              This option is superseded by the <u>--json[=JO]</u> option.  If  both  are  given  then  this  option  is
              ignored.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--no_inq</b>
              suppresses  the output of information obtained from an initial call to the INQUIRY command for the
              standard response. The default (assuming some other options that suppress this output are also not
              given) is to output several device identification strings.
              If this option is given twice (or more) then no INQUIRY command is sent hence  there  will  be  no
              device  identification  string output either. Also the peripheral device type (PDT) field will not
              be obtained so this utility will not be able to differentiate between  some  log  pages  that  are
              device  dependent.  The utility will assume a PDT of 0 (i.e. a disk) unless the <u>--pdt=DT</u> option is
              given.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--old</b>
              Switch to older style options. Please use as first option.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--page</b>=<u>PG</u>
              log page name/number to access. <u>PG</u> is either an acronym, a page number, or a page, subpage  number
              pair.  Available acronyms can be listed with the <u>--enumerate</u> option. Page (0 to 63) and subpage (0
              to 255) numbers are comma separated. They are decimal unless a hexadecimal indication is given.  A
              hexadecimal number can be specified by a leading "0x" or a trailing "h".
              A  few  acronyms  specify a range of subpage values in which case the acronym may be followed by a
              comma then a subpage number. This method can also be used to fetch the Supported subpages log page
              (e.g. --page=temp,0xff).

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--paramp</b>=<u>PP</u>
              <u>PP</u> is the parameter pointer value to place in a field of that name in the LOG SENSE cdb. A  number
              in  the  range  0  to  65535 (0x0 to 0xffff) is expected. When a value greater than 0 is given the
              <u>--ppc</u> option should be selected. The default value is 0.
              For log pages that have parameter codes, the <u>DEVICE</u> should return only parameters code equal to <u>PP</u>
              or higher in its response.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--pcb</b>
              show Parameter Control Byte settings (only relevant when log parameters being  output  in  ASCII).
              This byte includes the DU and TSD bits plus the 'Format and linking' field (2 bits wide).

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--pdt</b>=<u>DT</u>
              <u>DT</u>  is  the  peripheral  device  type (PDT) that is used when it is not available from the <u>DEVICE</u>.
              There are several cases: when the <u>DEVICE</u> is not given (e.g. when  the  <u>--inhex=FN</u>  or  <u>--enumerate</u>
              option  is  given)  and  when  <u>DEVICE</u>  is and is coupled with the <u>--no_inq</u> option. That stops this
              utility sending the SCSI INQUIRY command which  is  where  this  utility  usually  finds  the  PDT
              associated log pages being decoded.
              Numerical  values  between -1 and 31 (inclusive) may be used where -1 implies what is in SPC. SCSI
              Primary Commands (SPC) are common to all SCSI devices.  Names like 'tape', 'disk' and  'processor'
              may also be given for <u>DT</u>.  The default is 0 or 'disk' for SBC (and the associated standard acronym
              may also be given which is 'sbc' in this case).

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--ppc</b>
              sets  the  Parameter  Pointer Control (PPC) bit in the LOG SENSE cdb. Default is 0 (i.e. cleared).
              This bit was made obsolete in SPC-4 revision 18.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>
              output the response in binary to stdout. Error messages and warnings are output to stderr.
              This option may also be given together  with  <u>--in=FN</u>  in  which  case  the  contents  of  <u>FN</u>  are
              interpreted as binary data (and the response is decoded as normal, not dumped as binary).

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--readonly</b>
              open  the <u>DEVICE</u> read-only (e.g. in Unix with the O_RDONLY flag). The default action is to try and
              open <u>DEVICE</u> read-write then if that fails try  to  open  again  with  read-only.  However  when  a
              read-write  open  succeeds there may still be unwanted actions on the close (e.g. some OSes try to
              do a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command). So this option forces a read-only open on <u>DEVICE</u> and if it fails,
              this utility will exit. Note that options like <u>--select</u> most likely need a read-write open.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--reset</b>
              use SCSI LOG SELECT command (with the PCR bit set) to reset the all log pages (or the given page).
              Exactly what is reset depends on the accompanying SP bit (i.e. <u>--sp</u> option which  defaults  to  0)
              and  the  <u>PC</u>  ("page  control")  value  (which  defaults  to 1). Supplying this option implies the
              <u>--select</u> option as well. This option seems to clear error counter log pages but leaves pages  like
              self-test  results, start-stop cycle counter and temperature log pages unaffected. This option may
              be required to clear log pages if a counter reaches its maximum value since the log page in  which
              the  counter  is  found will remain "stuck" at its maximum value until some user interaction (e.g.
              calling sg_logs with this option).

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--select</b>
              use a LOG SELECT command. The default action (i.e. when neither this option nor <u>--reset</u> is  given)
              is to do a LOG SENSE command. See the LOG SELECT section.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--sp</b>
              sets  the  Saving  Parameters  (SP)  bit. Default is 0 (i.e. cleared). When set this instructs the
              device to store the current log page parameters (as indicated by the DS and TSD  parameter  codes)
              in  some  non-volatile  location.  Hence the log parameters will be preserved across power cycles.
              This option is typically not needed, especially if the GLTSD flag is clear  in  the  control  mode
              page  which  causes  the  <u>DEVICE</u>  to periodically save all saveable log parameters to non-volatile
              storage.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--temperature</b>
              outputs the temperature. First looks in the temperature log page and  if  that  is  not  available
              tries  the  Informational  Exceptions  log  page  which  may  also  have  the  current temperature
              (especially on older disks).

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--transport</b>
              outputs the transport ('Protocol specific port') log page. Equivalent to setting '--page=18h'.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--undefined</b>
              to see fields decoded, the <u>--hex</u> option cannot be used. However some fields are not defined in the
              T10 documents and in that case they are  output  in  hex.  This  option  controls  the  format  of
              'undefined' fields when they output in hex. Multiple uses of this option has the same sense as the
              <u>--hex</u>  option.  For  example  '-uu'  will  output  undefined  fields  in hexadecimal with an ASCII
              rendering to the right of each line.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--vendor</b>=<u>VP</u>
              where <u>VP</u> is a vendor/manufacturer (e.g. "sea" for Seagate) or product (group) acronym (e.g. "lto5"
              for the 5th generation LTO (tape) consortium). Either the whole log page is vendor specific  (e.g.
              page  numbers  0x30  to  0x3f)  or part of a T10 defined log page is vendor specific.  For example
              SPC-5 defines parameter code 0x0 of page 0x2f (the Informational Exceptions log page)  and  states
              that  the  remaining parameter codes (i.e. 0x1 to 0xffff) are vendor specific. Using a <u>VP</u> of "xxx"
              will list the available acronyms.
              If this option is used with <u>--page=PG</u> and <u>PG</u> is an acronym then this option is ignored. If <u>PG</u> is a
              number (e.g. 0xc0) then <u>VP</u> is used to choose the which vendor specific  page  (e.g.  sharing  page
              number 0xc0) to decode.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase  level  of  verbosity.  When  used with <u>--enumerate</u>, in the list of known log page names,
              those that have no associated decode logic are followed by "[hex only]".

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print out version string then exit.

</pre><h4><b>LOG</b> <b>SELECT</b></h4><pre>
       The SCSI LOG SELECT command can be used to reset certain parameters to  vendor  specific  defaults,  save
       them  to  non-volatile  storage  (i.e.  the media), or supply new page contents. This command has changed
       between SPC-3 and SPC-4 with the addition of the Page and Subpage Code fields which can only be non  zero
       when the Parameter list length is zero.

       The  <u>--select</u> (or <u>--reset</u>) option is required to issue a LOG SELECT command. If the <u>--in=FN</u> option is not
       given (or <u>FN</u> is effectively empty) then the Parameter list length field is set to zero.  If  the  <u>--in=FN</u>
       option  is  is  given  then  its decoded data is placed in the data-out buffer and its length in bytes is
       placed in the Parameter list length field.

       Other options that are active with the LOG SELECT command are <u>--control=PC</u>, <u>--reset</u> (which sets  the  PCR
       bit) and <u>--sp</u>.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>CLIENT</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  the  name  of a log page that acts as a container for data provided by the user. An application
       client is a SCSI term for the program that issues commands to a SCSI initiator (often known as a Host Bus
       Adapter (HBA)). So, for example, this utility is a SCSI application client.

       The Application Client log page has 64 log parameters with parameters codes 0 to 63. Each  can  hold  252
       bytes  of  user  binary data. That 252 bytes (or less) of user data, with a 4 byte prefix (for a total of
       256 bytes) can be provided with the <u>--in=FN</u> option. A typical prefix would be '0,n,83,fc'. The "n" is the
       parameter code in hex so the last log parameter would be '0,3f,83,fc'. That log parameter could  be  read
       back at some later time with '--page=0xf --filter=0x&lt;n&gt;'.

</pre><h4><b>INHEX</b> <b>INSTEAD</b> <b>OF</b> <b>DEVICE</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  applies  when  the  <u>--inhex=FN</u> option is used and there is no <u>DEVICE</u> argument. This can be
       viewed as a replay facility where the <u>FN</u> file was created by a prior invocation  of  this  utility,  most
       likely with the '-HHHHH' option, with command line output redirection used to create <u>FN</u>.

       If  the  <u>--all</u>  option  is  given  once then all pages (but not subpages) found in <u>FN</u> will be decoded, or
       output in hex if this utility is unable to decode some of them. If the <u>--all</u> option is given two or  more
       times  then  all  pages and subpages found in <u>FN</u> will be decoded.  In both cases pages are decoded in the
       order they are found in <u>FN</u>.

       Next, if the <u>--page=PG</u>] option is given, then <u>FN</u> is searched for a match on <u>PG</u> and, if  found,  that  log
       (sub)page  is  decoded.   If  the  <u>--list</u>  option  is  given  once, then the Supported log pages log page
       [0x0,0x0] is decoded, if present. If the <u>--list</u> option is given two or more times, then the Supported Log
       Pages and Subpages log page [0x0,0xff] is decoded, if present.

       If none of the above selection options are given, then this utility will attempt to decode the first  log
       page found in <u>FN</u>. If there are more log pages following the first one in <u>FN</u> then they are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This utility will usually do a double fetch of log pages with the SCSI LOG SENSE command. The first fetch
       requests a 4 byte response (i.e. place 4 in the "allocation length" field in the cdb). From that response
       it can calculate the actual length of the response which is what it asks for on the second fetch. This is
       typical  practice  in  SCSI  and  guaranteed  to  work in the standards. However some older devices don't
       comply. For those devices using the <u>--maxlen=LEN</u> option will do a single fetch.  A value of 252 should be
       a safe starting point.

       Various log pages hold information error rates, device temperature, start stop cycles  since  the  device
       was produced and the results of the last 20 self tests. Self tests can be initiated by the <a href="../man8/sg_senddiag.8.html">sg_senddiag</a>(8)
       utility.   The  smartmontools  package  provides  much  of  the  information found with sg_logs in a form
       suitable for monitoring the health of SCSI disks and tape drives.

       The simplest way to find which log pages can be decoded by this utility is to use the <u>--enumerate</u> option.
       Some page names are known but there is no decode logic; such cases have "[hex only]" after the  log  page
       name when the <u>--verbose</u> option is given with <u>--enumerate</u>.

       Vendors  are  specifically  permitted  by the SPC-6 to _not_ report all pages and subpages supported by a
       device. That weakens the usefulness of the pages that report a list of supported pages and subpages.  One
       guarantee which is given is that the pages reported shall be in ascending order.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_logs is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

</pre><h4><b>OLDER</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  options  in  this  section were the only ones available prior to sg3_utils version 1.23 . Since then
       this utility defaults to the newer command line options which can be overridden by using <u>--old</u> (or <u>-O</u>) as
       the first option. See the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section for another way to force the use of  these  older
       command line options.

       Options  with  arguments  or  with two or more letters can have an extra '-' prepended. For example: both
       '-pcb' and '--pcb' are acceptable.

       <b>-a</b>     outputs all the log pages supported by the <u>DEVICE</u>.  Equivalent to <u>--all</u> in the main description.

       <b>-A</b>     outputs all the log pages and subpages supported by the <u>DEVICE</u>.  Equivalent to <u>--ALL</u> in  the  main
              description.

       <b>-c</b>=<u>PC</u>  Equivalent to <u>--control=PC</u> in the main description.

       <b>-D</b>=<u>DT</u>  Equivalent to <u>--pdt=DT</u> in the main description.

       <b>-e</b>     enumerate internal tables to show information about known log pages.  Equivalent to <u>--enumerate</u> in
              the main description.

       <b>-E</b>     Equivalent to <u>--exclude</u> in the main description.

       <b>-h</b>     suppresses decoding of known log sense pages and prints out the response in hex instead.

       <b>-i</b>=<u>FN</u>  <u>FN</u>  is  treated  as a file name (or '-' for stdin) which contains ASCII hexadecimal representing a
              log page that will be sent as parameter data of a LOG SELECT command. See the LOG SELECT section.

       <b>-H</b>     same action as '-h' in this section and equivalent to <u>--hex</u> in the main description.

       <b>-l</b>     lists the names of all logs sense pages supported by this <u>DEVICE</u>.  Equivalent  to  <u>--list</u>  in  the
              main description.

       <b>-L</b>     lists  the  names  of  all  logs  sense pages and subpages supported by this <u>DEVICE</u>. Equivalent to
              '--list --list' in the main description.

       <b>-m</b>=<u>LEN</u> request only <u>LEN</u> bytes of response data. Default  is  0  which  is  interpreted  as  all  that  is
              available.  <u>LEN</u>  is  decimal  unless  it  has  a  leading  '0x'  or  trailing  'h'.  Equivalent to
              <u>--maxlen=LEN</u> in the main description.

       <b>-M</b>=<u>VP</u>  Equivalent to <u>--vendor=VP</u> in the main description.

       <b>-n</b>     Equivalent to <u>--name</u> in the main description.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--new</b>
              Switch to the newer style options.

       <b>-p</b>=<u>PG</u>  log page code to access. <u>PG</u> is either an  acronym,  a  page  number,  or  a  page,  subpage  pair.
              Available acronyms can be listed with the <u>--enumerate</u> option. Page (0 to 3f) and subpage (0 to ff)
              numbers are comma separated. The numbers are assumed to be hexadecimal.

       <b>-paramp</b>=<u>PP</u>
              <u>PP</u>  is the parameter pointer value (in hex) to place in command.  Should be a number between 0 and
              ffff inclusive.

       <b>-pcb</b>   show Parameter Control Byte settings (only relevant when log parameters being output in ASCII).

       <b>-ppc</b>   sets the Parameter Pointer Control (PPC) bit. Default is 0 (i.e. cleared).

       <b>-r</b>     use SCSI LOG SELECT command (PCR bit set) to  reset  the  all  log  pages  (or  the  given  page).
              Equivalent to <u>--reset</u> in the main description.

       <b>-R</b>     Equivalent to <u>--readonly</u> in the main description.

       <b>-select</b>
              use a LOG SELECT command. Equivalent to <u>--select</u> in the main description.

       <b>-sp</b>    sets  the Saving Parameters (SP) bit. Default is 0 (i.e. cleared).  Equivalent to <u>--sp</u> in the main
              description.

       <b>-t</b>     outputs the temperature. Equivalent to <u>--temperature</u> in the main description.

       <b>-T</b>     outputs the transport ('Protocol specific port') log page. Equivalent to <u>--transport</u> in  the  main
              description.

       <b>-v</b>     increase level of verbosity.

       <b>-V</b>     print out version string then exit.

       <b>-x</b>     suppress the INQUIRY command. Equivalent to <u>--no_inq</u> in the main description.

       <b>-?</b>     output usage message then exit.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Since sg3_utils version 1.23 the environment variable SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS can be given. When it is present
       this  utility will expect the older command line options. So the presence of this environment variable is
       equivalent to using <u>--old</u> (or <u>-O</u>) as the first command line option.
