       sg_rep_zones - send SCSI REPORT ZONES, REALMS or ZONE DOMAINS command

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sg_rep_zones</b>  [<u>--brief</u>]  [<u>--domain</u>]  [<u>--find=ZT</u>]  [<u>--force</u>]  [<u>--help</u>]  [<u>--hex</u>] [<u>--inhex=FN</u>] [<u>--json[=JO</u>]]
       [<u>--js-file=JFN</u>] [<u>--locator=LBA</u>] [<u>--maxlen=LEN</u>] [<u>--num=NUM</u>]  [<u>--partial</u>]  [<u>--raw</u>]  [<u>--readonly</u>]  [<u>--realm</u>]
       [<u>--report=OPT</u>] [<u>--start=LBA</u>] [<u>--statistics</u>] [<u>--verbose</u>] [<u>--version</u>] [<u>--wp</u>] <u>DEVICE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sends  a SCSI REPORT ZONES, REPORT REALMS or REPORT ZONE DOMAINS command to <u>DEVICE</u> and decodes (or simply
       outputs) the data  returned.  These  commands  are  found  in  the  ZBC-2  draft  standard,  revision  12
       (zbc2r12.pdf).   Only  the REPORT ZONES command is defined in the original ZBC standard (INCITS 536-2017)
       and it is the default for this utility.

       The REPORT ZONE DOMAINS command will be sent (and decoded) when the <u>--domain</u> option is given. The  REPORT
       REALMS command will be sent (and decoded) when the <u>--realm</u> option is given.

       Rather  than  send  a SCSI command to <u>DEVICE</u>, if the <u>--inhex=FN</u> option is given, then the contents of the
       file named <u>FN</u> are decoded as ASCII hex (or binary if <u>--raw</u> is also given) and then processed as if it was
       the response of the command. By default the REPORT ZONES command response is assumed; if the <u>--domain</u>  or
       <u>--realm</u> option is given then the corresponding command response is assumed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--brief</b>
              even  though  a ZBC disk will typically limit the size of the response to the REPORT ZONES command
              (e.g. due to the "allocation length" field), this may still be potentially a lot of  output.  This
              option  will  only decode and output fields found in the response header plus fields from the last
              descriptor in the current response.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--domain</b>
              send or decode the SCSI REPORT ZONE DOMAINS command.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--find</b>=<u>ZT</u>
              where <u>ZT</u> is a zone type number or an abbreviation for a zone type. If <u>ZT</u> is prefixed by either '-'
              or '!' then the check for equality is inverted to be a check for inequality. IOWs it does a:  find
              the first occurrence that is <b>not</b> the given zone type.
              The  algorithm  used  by  this  option  takes  into  account  the  <u>--hex</u>, <u>--maxlen=LEN</u>, <u>--num=NUM</u>,
              <u>--report=OPT</u> and <u>--start=LBA</u> options, if given, and ignores other options. It is only  implemented
              for  the  Report  zones  command  currently.  The  algorithm  may  call  the  Report zones command
              repeatedly, with the PARTIAL bit set and the Zone start LBA field being increased as it goes. This
              continues until either there is a match on the <u>ZT</u> condition, <u>--num=NUM</u> is exhausted or the  number
              of zones is exhausted.
              The  <u>ZT</u> numbers and abbreviations are listed when the <u>--help</u> option is given twice. Warning: using
              '!' for inverting the condition may not be so practical as the shell (e.g. bash) may interpret '!'
              as having special meaning. Placing single quotes around <u>ZT</u> fixes the problem for  the  bash  shell
              (e.g. --find='!c' meaning find the first zone whose type is not conventional).

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
              when  decoding  the  response  to  this command, certain sanity checks are done and if they fail a
              message is sent to stderr and a non-zero exit status is set. If this option is given those  sanity
              checks are bypassed.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              output the usage message then exit. When given twice, additional usage information is output.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b>
              output the response in hexadecimal to stdout. When used once the whole response is output in ASCII
              hexadecimal  with  a  leading  address  (starting  at  0)  on each line. When used twice each zone
              descriptor in the response is output  separately  in  hexadecimal.  When  used  thrice  the  whole
              response is output in hexadecimal with no leading address (on each line).
              When  this  option  is used twice, it can be useful with either the <u>--brief</u> or <u>--find=ZT</u> option to
              only output the header and zone descriptor in hex that those two options would otherwise print  in
              ASCII in the absence of the <u>--hex</u> option.
              The  output  format  when  this option is given thrice is suitable for a later invocation with the
              <u>--inhex=FN</u> option.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--inhex</b>=<u>FN</u>
              where <u>FN</u> is a file name whose contents are assumed to be ASCII  hexadecimal.  If  <u>DEVICE</u>  is  also
              given  then  <u>DEVICE</u>  is  ignored, a warning is issued and the utility continues, decoding the file
              named <u>FN</u>. See the "HEX, BINARY AND JSON  FORMATS"  section  in  the  sg3_utils  manpage  for  more
              information. If the <u>--raw</u> option is also given then the contents of <u>FN</u> are treated as binary.
              Note  that  by  default  this  utility  assumes then contents are the response from a REPORT ZONES
              command. Use the <u>--domain</u> or <u>--realm</u> option for decoding the other two commands.

       <b>-j</b>[=<u>JO</u>], <b>--json</b>[=<u>JO</u>]
              output is in JSON format instead of plain text form. Note that arguments to  the  short  and  long
              form  are  themselves optional and if present start with "=" and no whitespace is permitted around
              that "=".
              See sg3_utils_json manpage or use '?' for <u>JO</u> to get a summary.

       <b>-J</b>, <b>--js-file</b>=<u>JFN</u>
              output is in JSON format and it is sent to a file named <u>JFN</u>.  If  that  file  exists  then  it  is
              truncated. By default, the JSON output is sent to stdout.
              When  this  option  is  given,  the  <u>--json[=JO]</u>  option  is  implied  and  need not be given. The
              <u>--json[=JO]</u> option may still be needed to set the <u>JO</u> parameter to non-default values.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--locator</b>=<u>LBA</u>
              where <u>LBA</u> plays a similar role as it does in <u>--start=LBA</u>.  It is the field name used in the REPORT
              REALMS and REPORT ZONE DOMAINS commands.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--maxlen</b>=<u>LEN</u>
              where <u>LEN</u> is the (maximum) response length in bytes. It is placed in the cdb's "allocation length"
              field. If not given (or <u>LEN</u> is zero) then 16384 is used. The  maximum  allowed  value  of  <u>LEN</u>  is
              2097152.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--num</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              where  <u>NUM</u>  is  the  (maximum) number of zone descriptors to print out.  The default value is zero
              which is taken to mean print out all zone descriptors returned by the REPORT ZONES command.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--partial</b>
              set the PARTIAL bit in the cdb. Without the PARTIAL bit set a ZBC disk  will  attempt  to  form  a
              response  with  all  zones  from  <u>LBA</u> to the end of the disk. If there are a large number of zones
              (e.g. &gt; 10,000) this large response will be truncated so that it doesn't  exceed  the  "allocation
              length"  field  in  the  cdb (see <u>--maxlen=LEN</u>). The advantage of doing this is that the number of
              (remaining) zones on the disk can be calculated.  The disadvantage is the amount of time that  may
              take.
              With  the  PARTIAL bit set in the cdb, only the number of zones implied by the "allocation length"
              field are fetched. This may be considerably faster than the same command without the  PARTIAL  bit
              set.
              When iterating through the zones on a ZBC disk, the process will be faster when the PARTIAL bit is
              set.  Typically <u>--start=LBA</u> is set to zero or the [LBA + zone_length] of the last zone reported in
              the previous iteration.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>
              output response in binary (to stdout) unless the <u>--inhex=FN</u> option is also given. In that case the
              input file name (<u>FN</u>) is decoded as binary (and the output is _not_ in binary (but may be hex)).

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--readonly</b>
              open the <u>DEVICE</u> read-only (e.g. in Unix with the O_RDONLY  flag).   The  default  is  to  open  it
              read-write.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--realm</b>
              send or decode the SCSI REPORT REALMS command.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--report</b>=<u>OPT</u>
              where <u>OPT</u> will become the contents of the REPORTING OPTION field in the cdb. The reporting options
              differ  between REPORT ZONES, REPORT ZONE DOMAINS and REPORT REALMS. If the <u>--help</u> option is given
              twice ( or the equivalent '-hh') a list of available reporting options (as of  writing)  for  each
              command is output.
              The  default value for REPORT ZONES is 0 which means report a list of all zones. Some other values
              are 1 for list zones with a zone condition of empty; 2 for list zones with  a  zone  condition  of
              implicitly  opened;  3 for list zones with a zone condition of explicitly opened; 4 for list zones
              with a zone condition of closed; 5 for list zones with a zone condition of full; 6 for list  zones
              with  a  zone  condition  of  read  only; 7 for list zones with a zone condition of offline. Other
              values are 0x10 for list zones with 'RWP recommended' set  to  true;  0x11  for  list  zones  with
              non-sequential  write  resource  active set to true, 0x3e for list zones apart from GAP zones, and
              0x3f for list zones with a zone condition of 'not write pointer'.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--start</b>=<u>LBA</u>
              where <u>LBA</u> is at the start or within the first zone to be reported. The default value is 0. If  <u>LBA</u>
              is  not a zone start LBA then the preceding zone start LBA is used for reporting. Assumed to be in
              decimal unless prefixed with '0x' or has a trailing 'h' which indicate hexadecimal.
              The zone start LBA field used in the REPORT ZONES command was changed  to  the  zone  domain/realm
              locator field for the two newer ZBC-2 commands. For this utility <u>--locator=LBA</u> and <u>--start=LBA</u> are
              interchangeable.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--statistics</b>
              reviews  all or a limited number of report zones, collects statistics and prints them (on stdout).
              The number of zones reviewed may be limited by any  combination  of  <u>--num=NUM</u>,  <u>--report=OPT</u>  and
              <u>--start=LBA</u> options. The long option name may be abbreviated to <u>--stats</u>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print the version string and then exit.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--wp</b>
              print the write pointer (in hex) only. In the absence of errors, then a hex LBA will be printed on
              each  line,  one  line  for each zone. Can be usefully combined with the <u>--num=NUM</u> and <u>--start=LBA</u>
              options.
