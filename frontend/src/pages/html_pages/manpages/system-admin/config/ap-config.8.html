       ap-config - configure and monitor Atmel and NWN based APs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ap-config</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ap-config</b> to config and get stats from Atmel-chipset based AP with ATMEL Private MIB support.

</pre><h4><b>MENU</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Info/</b>

       <b>SysInfo</b>
              Get info about AP hardware and software

       <b>Ethernet</b>
              This option displays the Ethernet statistics for your reference.

       <b>Wireless</b>
              This option displays the wireless statistics for your reference.

       <b>Stations</b> <b>(atmel)</b>
              Under this menu the user will be able to see the Associated Stations that are currently associated
              with  the  Access Point. For each associated station the user will be able to see the MAC Address.
              From version 0.7.3-pre1 you may save mac addresses list to file ~/&lt;util_name&gt;.stations.   Stations
              on NWN AP: For each associated station the user will be able to see the MAC Address, Link Quality,
              RSSI and Idle time.
               *  Mac address: If the association is pending (that is, the Client is scanning, authenticating or
              associating), assocAddress contains the MAC address of that Client  with  the  group  bit  set  to
              indicate  that  the Access Point is aware of the presence of that Client. The other objects of the
              entry will be updated based on the information extracted from the received Probe Requests.
               * Link Quality: An indicator for the quality of the Client. If the association is still  pending,
              the  quality  is  calculated  over  the  received Probe Requests from the Client. If the Client is
              associated, the quality derived from any activity with  the  Client.  The  actual  quality  source
              depends on the selected quality indicator. The semantics of the indicator is 'low is good quality'
              and 'high is bad quality'.
               *  IdleTime:  An  indicator (in seconds) for the age of the information on the Client. The age is
              reset to 0 if any activity of this Client is detected.
               * RSSI: An indicator for the RSSI of the Client. If the association is still pending, the RSSI is
              calculated over the received Probe Requests from the Client. If the Client is associated, the RSSI
              derived from any activity with the Client.

       <b>KnownAP</b>
              By using option APs from info menu you may see all Access Points thats visible by your AP.
               * Link  Quality:  An indicator for the quality of the  Client.  If  the  association   is   still
              pending,  the   quality   is  calculated  over the received Probe Requests from the Client. If the
              Client is  associated,  the  quality  derived from  any  activity  with  the  Client.  The  actual
              quality   source  depends  on the  selected  quality  indicator. The semantics of the indicator is
              'low is good quality' and 'high is bad quality'.
               * RSSI:  An indicator for the RSSI in dBm of the Client.  If the association  is  still  pending,
              the   RSSI   is  calculated   over  the  received Probe Requests from the Client. If the Client is
              associated,  the  RSSI derived from any activity with the Client.
               * WARNING! By reports this option my be  dangerously  -  in  some  cases  you  may  lost  you  AP
              configuration and on SMC2655W the one way to fix it - only restore factory defaults.

       <b>Config/</b>

       <b>Bridging</b>
                   IP  configuration  -  If  the  server site supports DHCP function and the  DHCP Enable box is
              ticked; the IP address of an access point will be automatically displayed and assigned; otherwise,
              you need to key in an IP address now.       The primary port provides a wired or  wireless  method
              to  change  the access point setting. If the  Ethernet  option is ticked, the setting of an access
              point can be done through Ethernet. If the Wireless  option is ticked, the access  point  function
              can be set through a wireless station. Wireless station means a laptop PC or a desktop PC equipped
              with  an  IEEE802.11b  PCMCIA  card  or  USB dongle.       Enable SNMP Traps enables the SNMP trap
              function. You can view the records by using ap-trapd utility.       You are allowed  to  set  your
              access point to be used as  Access point, Access point client, or  Wireless bridge.
               *  Access  Point - An internetworking device that seamlessly connects wired and wireless networks
              together.
               * Wireless bridge Point to point - The point-to-point  wireless  bridge  configuration  uses  two
              Wireless  Bridge  units  to  connect two separate LANs. You must to fill in the Remote MAC Address
              before your bridge-function-enable access point can work with it.
               * Point to multipoint - When connecting three to more separate LANs, each  LAN  located  building
              requires  a  wireless  bridge.  This  is  called Multipoint wireless bridge and again requires one
              Master  bridge unit and two or more Slave bridge units as  required.  If  the  point-to-multipoint
              option  is  selected,  your bridge-function-enable access point will designate as a  Mater  and to
              work with it, others bridges need to be set as a point-to-point bridge and enter the  MAC  address
              of the mater access point.

       <b>Wireless</b>
              You  can  give  your access point a name and give it an ESSID (Extended Service Station ID), which
              can allow other wireless stations, which knows the ESSID, to link with it.

       <b>Privacy</b>
              The Privacy options allow  you  to  enable  64-bit  or  128-bit  WEP  (wired  equivalent  privacy)
              encryption. If an encryption function is not needed, you can just simply tick on the  Disable  box
              to disable it. If the 64-bit or 128-bit encryption function is enabled, there are four sets of key
              need to be filled into the blanket boxes. For the 64-bit encryption, each key is required to enter
              5  Hex  digits. For example: 11 22 33 44 55.  The 128-bit encryption requires each key to enter 13
              Hex digits. For example: 12 34 56 78 9A BC DE F0 11 22 33 44 55.
              NOTE! The WEP keys you enter are really accepted and written to the AP, permanently if you  do  an
              Upload  from  the Commands menu after setting them.  However, the new key values are not echoed to
              the user when you return to the Privacy settings under  the  Config  menu.   This  is  a  security
              feature of SNMP implementation in this hardware.

       <b>Authorized</b> <b>MAC</b> <b>address</b>
              For  security  or  management  purpose, you can edit a list of authorized MAC addresses, which are
              allowed to view or modify the setting of an  access  point.  Authorization  Table  Enable   option
              allows you to enable or disable this function.

       <b>Community</b>
              The  Community  configuration   allow  you  to  set  a  phrase  for administrator and manufacturer
              community and a phrase for user community. If a user knows the phrase of administrator, he/she  is
              authorized  to  change  the setting of an access point. If a user only knows about the phrase of a
              user community; he/she is allowed to view the setting of an access point but  is  not  allowed  to
              change the setting.

       <b>Radio</b>       Under the Radio user will be able to set or get the Transmitting Powervalues, for the Control
              Register  31  of  the Baseband, for each channel. Reg CR31: Under this option user defines a value
              for the transmitted power (Value for the Control register 31 of the baseband) and it  must  be  in
              the  range  128 (max) to 255 (min) in Decimal form. Starting from version 0.6 of Access Point SNMP
              Config utility it's possible to set power output level for your  AP.  You  may  set  signal  power
              output in range from 0mw to 100mw by setting value for corresponding channel from 0 to 255 (0xFF).
              The scale is as follows:
                           Value: 00----------128--------255
                           Power: 0mw--------100mw-------0mw
                   So  to  get  maximum  power  output  from  your AP set value for corresponding channel to 128
              (0x80). But sometimes better solution -  experimentally  choose  values  for  best  link  quality,
              sometimes not max. More info you can get from:

       <b>Advanced</b>

       StationDBTimeout:  This  object specifies a timeout on entries and their state information in the Station
       database. For Clients the Station database is mapped on the roamTable. For  Access  Points,  the  Station
       database is mapped on the assocTable. The timeout is in seconds.

       ACKWindow: The ACK frame time out defined in number of slottimes. This can be used to optimize long range
       links.

       <b>Commands/</b>

       <b>Upload</b> After  you ve changed any value or setting of an access point through the SNMP config utility. You
              must come back to this option to make the new changes and  setting  s  validated.  Also,  only  an
              administrator and manufacturer is allowed to do such changes.

       <b>Defaults</b>
              Restore factory default configuration.

       <b>Reset</b>  Reset AP. All changed and not uploaded settings will be lost.

       <b>TestMode/</b>
                   When user selects the Tests option a form will appear indicating a number of parameter needed
              to be set by the user in order to perform the Radio test.
                      Antenna: Under this option we specify the antenna to be tested (A, B).
                      Tx  Filter:  Under this option user needs to select the Baseband transmitting Filter to be
              used. There are two options (US, JPN) available since the bandwidth for Europe - USA is 11MHz  and
              for, Japan is 14MHz.
                      Rate:  Under  this  option  user  needs to specify the rate to be used among the following
              options 1Mbps, 2Mbps, 5.5Mbps and 11Mbps.
                      Channel: Under this option user needs to select the channel  to  be  used.  There  are  14
              channels  available.        After  setting  the  parameters  there  are  three commands available:
              Continuous Tx (with modulation), Continuous Tx (without modulation) and Continuous Rx:
               * Continuous Tx (with modulation): Using this command the MAC sets the transmitter in  continuous
              mode with modulation. We can measure the output power of the radio.
               * Continuous Tx (without modulation): Using this command we can measure the frequency accuracy of
              the  radio.  The  MAC  sets  the  baseband  Processor in test mode and turns off the spreading and
              scrambling codes.
               * Continuous Rx: With this command user can set the device in a receiving mode.
               Note: In  order to perform the above test user needs to have a Spectrum Analyzer connected.

       <b>Connect/</b>
              In order to make a connection with Access Point user needs to set two parameters. The  IP  Address
              of the Access Point and the Community name (default 'public').

       <b>Search/</b>
              Find  connected  Access  Points.  Search  for  WNW  APs  only  works  if community set to right AP
              community. It's useful if you know community but dont know what ip your AP got from  DHCP  server.
              You must have support for multicasting enabled in kernel.

       <b>About/</b> About function shows the Wireless Access Point Configurator for Unix version and short info.

       <b>Shell/</b> Run subshell. To return type 'exit'
