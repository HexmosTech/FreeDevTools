</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       verify_krb5_conf — checks krb5.conf for obvious errors

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>verify_krb5_conf</b> <u>[config-file]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>verify_krb5_conf</b>  reads  the  configuration file <u>krb5.conf</u>, or the file given on the command line, parses
       it, checking verifying that the syntax is not correctly wrong.

       If the file is syntactically correct, <b>verify_krb5_conf</b> tries to verify that the contents of the  file  is
       of relevant nature.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       KRB5_CONFIG points to the configuration file to read.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/krb5.conf</u>  Kerberos 5 configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Possible output from <b>verify_krb5_conf</b> include:

       &lt;path&gt;: failed to parse &lt;something&gt; as size/time/number/boolean
               Usually  means  that &lt;something&gt; is misspelled, or that it contains weird characters. The parsing
               done by <b>verify_krb5_conf</b> is more strict than the one performed by libkrb5, so strings  that  work
               in real life might be reported as bad.

       &lt;path&gt;: host not found (&lt;hostname&gt;)
               Means that &lt;path&gt; is supposed to point to a host, but it can't be recognised as one.

       &lt;path&gt;: unknown or wrong type
               Means  that  &lt;path&gt;  is  either  a  string  when  it  should  be a list, vice versa, or just that
               <b>verify_krb5_conf</b> is confused.

       &lt;path&gt;: unknown entry
               Means that &lt;string&gt; is not known by <b>verify_krb5_conf</b>.

       <u><a href="../man5/krb5.conf.5.html">krb5.conf</a></u>(5)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Since each application can put almost anything in the config file, it's hard to come up with a watertight
       verification process. Most of the default settings are sanity checked, but this does not mean that  every
       problem  is  discovered,  or that everything that is reported as a possible problem actually is one. This
       tool should thus be used with some care.

       It should warn about obsolete data, or bad practice, but currently doesn't.
