</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options (flags) that can be passed anywhere in the command chain.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Show  help  about  last  valid  command. For example <b>tipc</b> <b>link</b> <b>--help</b> will show link help and <b>tipc</b>
              <b>--help</b> will show general help. The position of the option in the string is irrelevant.

       <b>-j</b>, <b>-json</b>
              Output results in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

       <b>-p</b>, <b>-pretty</b>
              The default JSON format is compact and more efficient to parse but hard for most  users  to  read.
              This flag adds indentation for readability.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Link</b> <b>statistics</b>
       <b>ACTIVE</b> link state
              An  <b>ACTIVE</b>  link is serving traffic. Two links to the same node can become <b>ACTIVE</b> if they have the
              same link <b>priority</b>.  If there is more than two links with the same priority the  additional  links
              will be put in <b>STANDBY</b> state.

       <b>STANDBY</b> link state
              A  <b>STANDBY</b>  link  has  lower link priority than an <b>ACTIVE</b> link. A <b>STANDBY</b> link has control traffic
              flowing and is ready to take over should the <b>ACTIVE</b> link(s) go down.

       <b>MTU</b>
              The Maximum Transmission Unit. The two endpoints advertise their  default  or  configured  <b>MTU</b>  at
              initial link setup and will agree to use the lower of the two values should they differ.

       <b>Packets</b>
              The  total  amount  of  transmitted  or  received TIPC packets on a link. Including <b>fragmented</b> and
              <b>bundled</b> packets.

       <b>Fragments</b>
              Represented in the form <b>fragments</b>/<b>fragmented</b>.  Where <b>fragmented</b> is the  amount  of  data  messages
              which have been broken into <b>fragments</b>.  Subsequently the <b>fragments</b> are the total amount of packets
              that the <b>fragmented</b> messages has been broken into.

       <b>Bundles</b>
              Represented  in  the  form  <b>bundles</b>/<b>bundled</b>.  If a link becomes congested the link will attempt to
              bundle data from small <b>bundled</b> packets into <b>bundles</b> of full  MTU  size  packets  before  they  are
              transmitted.

       <b>Profile</b>
              Shows  the  <b>average</b>  packet size in octets/bytes for a <b>sample</b> of packets. It also shows the packet
              size distribution of the <b>sampled</b> packets in the intervals

              0-64 bytes
              64-256 bytes
              256-1024 bytes
              1024-4096 bytes
              4096-16384 bytes
              16384-32768 bytes
              32768-66000 bytes

       <b>Message</b> <b>counters</b>

              <b>states</b> - Number of link state messages

              <b>probes</b> - Link state messages with probe flag set. Typically sent when a link is idle

              <b>nacks</b> - Number of negative acknowledgement (NACK) packets sent and received by the link

              <b>defs</b> - Number of packets received out of order

              <b>dups</b> - Number of duplicate packets received

       <b>Congestion</b> <b>link</b>
              The number of times an application has tried to send data when the TIPC link was congested

       <b>Send</b> <b>queue</b>
              <b>Max</b> is the maximum amount of messages that has resided in the  out  queue  during  the  statistics
              collection period of a link.

              <b>Avg</b> is the average outqueue size during the lifetime of a link.

   <b>Link</b> <b>properties</b>
       <b>priority</b>
              The  priority  between  logical  TIPC  links  to a particular node. Link priority can range from 0
              (lowest) to 31 (highest).

       <b>tolerance</b>
              Link tolerance specifies the maximum time in milliseconds that TIPC  will  allow  a  communication
              problem to exist before taking the link down. The default value is 1500 milliseconds.

       <b>window</b>
              The link window controls how many unacknowledged messages a link endpoint can have in its transmit
              queue before TIPC's congestion control mechanism is activated.

   <b>Monitor</b> <b>properties</b>
       <b>threshold</b>
              The threshold specifies the cluster size exceeding which the link monitoring algorithm will switch
              from  "full-mesh" to "overlapping-ring".  If set of 0 the overlapping-ring monitoring is always on
              and if set to a value larger than anticipated cluster size the overlapping-ring is disabled.   The
              default value is 32.

   <b>Monitor</b> <b>information</b>
       <b>table_generation</b>
              Represents  the  event  count  in  a  node's  local monitoring list. It steps every time something
              changes in the local monitor list, including changes in the local domain.

       <b>cluster_size</b>
              Represents the current count of cluster members.

       <b>algorithm</b>
              The current supervision algorithm used for neighbour monitoring for the bearer.   Possible  values
              are full-mesh or overlapping-ring.

       <b>status</b>
              The node status derived by the local node.  Possible status are up or down.

       <b>monitored</b>
              Represent  the  type  of  monitoring  chosen  by  the  local  node.  Possible values are direct or
              indirect.

       <b>generation</b>
              Represents the domain generation which is the event count in a node's  local  domain.  Every  time
              something  changes (peer add/remove/up/down) the domain generation is stepped and a new version of
              node record is sent to inform the neighbors about this change. The  domain  generation  helps  the
              receiver of a domain record to know if it should ignore or process the record.

       <b>applied_node_status</b>
              The node status reported by the peer node for the succeeding peers in the node list. The Node list
              is a circular list of ascending addresses starting with the local node.  Possible status are: U or
              D. The status U implies up and D down.

       <b>[non_applied_node:status]</b>
              Represents  the nodes and their status as reported by the peer node.  These nodes were not applied
              to the monitoring list for this peer node.  They  are  usually  transient  and  occur  during  the
              cluster  startup  phase  or  network  reconfiguration.   Possible status are: U or D. The status U
              implies up and D down.

   <b>Broadcast</b> <b>properties</b>
       <b>BROADCAST</b>
              Forces all multicast traffic to be transmitted via broadcast only, irrespective  of  cluster  size
              and number of destinations.

       <b>REPLICAST</b>
              Forces  all  multicast  traffic to be transmitted via replicast only, irrespective of cluster size
              and number of destinations.

       <b>AUTOSELECT</b>
              Auto switching to broadcast or replicast depending on cluster size and destination node number.

       <b>ratio</b> <b>SIZE</b>
              Set the AUTOSELECT criteria, percentage of destination nodes vs cluster size.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       tipc link monitor list
           Shows the link monitoring information for cluster members on device data0.

       tipc link monitor summary
           The monitor summary command prints the basic attributes.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       Exit status is 0 if command was successful or a positive integer upon failure.
