       firebird - Firebird server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           firebird [&lt;option&gt;...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>firebird</b> is the main process of the Firebird RDBMS server. It has three modes of operation:

       single-process
           This  is  the  same  as  the  <u>superserver</u>  flavour of version 2.5 and before. It consists of a single
           listener process that handles all connections. It is single-threaded  and  therefore  is  capable  of
           using  only one CPU. All connections use shared cache to database pages. A crash in the code handling
           a connection brings down the whole server.

       standalone classic
           This is the same as the <u>superclassic</u> flavour of the 2.5 version. A single listener process  spawns  a
           new  thread  for each connection. It is capable of utilizing multiple CPUs. The database cache is not
           shared between connections.  The inter-process communication  is  pretty  fast  because  all  threads
           reside in the same process. A crash in the code handling a connection brings down the whole server.

       Internet "super-server" handler
           This  is  the  same as the <u>classic</u> flavour of version 2.5 and before. Each connection is handled by a
           separate <b>fireird</b> process, spawned by the Internet super-server (e.g. inetd or xinetd). It is  capable
           of  utilizing multiple CPUs.  The database cache is not shared and the inter-process communication is
           slower than the other operational modes. In this mode, a crash caused by one connection doesn't bring
           down the whole server, but only the crashed instance.
