       telnetd — DARPA telnet protocol server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/usr/sbin/in.telnetd</b>  [<b>-hnNs</b>] [<b>-a</b> <u>authmode</u>] [<b>-D</b> <u>debugmode</u>] [<b>-L</b> <u>loginprg</u>] [<b>-S</b> <u>tos</u>] [<b>-X</b> <u>authtype</u>] [<b>-edebug</b>]
                            [<b>-debug</b> <u>port</u>] [<b>-z</b> <u>sslopt</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>telnetd</b> program is a server which supports  the  DARPA  telnet  interactive  communication  protocol.
       <b>Telnetd</b>  is  normally invoked by the internet server (see <u><a href="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd</a></u>(8)) for requests to connect to the telnet
       port as indicated by the <u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u> file (see <u><a href="../man5/services.5.html">services</a></u>(5)).  The <b>-debug</b> option may be used to start up
       <b>telnetd</b> manually, instead of through <u><a href="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd</a></u>(8).  If started up this way, <u>port</u>  may  be  specified  to  run
       <b>telnetd</b> on an alternate TCP port number.

       The <b>telnetd</b> program accepts the following options:

       <b>-a</b> <u>authmode</u>  This  option  may  be used for specifying what mode should be used for authentication.  Note
                    that  this  option  is  only  useful  if  <b>telnetd</b>  has  been  compiled  with   support   for
                    authentication,  which  is  not  available  in the current version.  The following values of
                    <u>authmode</u> are understood:

                    debug  Turns on authentication debugging code.

                    user   Only allow  connections  when  the  remote  user  can  provide  valid  authentication
                           information  to  identify  the  remote  user,  and is allowed access to the specified
                           account without providing a password.

                    valid  Only allow  connections  when  the  remote  user  can  provide  valid  authentication
                           information  to  identify  the  remote  user.   The <u><a href="../man1/login.1.html">login</a></u>(1) command will provide any
                           additional user verification needed if the  remote  user  is  not  allowed  automatic
                           access to the specified account.

                    other  Only  allow  connections that supply some authentication information.  This option is
                           currently not supported by any of the existing authentication mechanisms, and is thus
                           the same as specifying <b>valid</b>.

                    none   This is the default state.  Authentication information is not  required.   If  no  or
                           insufficient  authentication  information is provided, then the <u><a href="../man1/login.1.html">login</a></u>(1) program will
                           provide the necessary user verification.

                    off    This disables the authentication code.  All user verification will happen through the
                           <u><a href="../man1/login.1.html">login</a></u>(1) program.

       <b>-D</b> <u>debugmode</u>
                    This option may be used for debugging purposes.  It allows <b>telnetd</b> to  print  out  debugging
                    information to the connection, allowing the user to see what <b>telnetd</b> is doing.  Repeated use
                    of  the  option  arranges  composite  debug  reports.  There are several possible values for
                    <u>debugmode:</u>

                    <b>options</b>   Prints information about the negotiation of telnet options.

                    <b>report</b>    Prints the <b>options</b>  information,  plus  some  additional  information  about  what
                              processing is going on.

                    <b>netdata</b>   Displays the data stream received by <b>telnetd.</b>

                    <b>ptydata</b>   Displays data written to the pty.

                    <b>exercise</b>  Has not been implemented yet.

       <b>-edebug</b>      If  <b>telnetd</b>  has  been  compiled with support for encryption, then the <b>-edebug</b> option may be
                    used to enable encryption debugging code.

       <b>-h</b>           Disables the printing of host-specific information before login has been completed.

       <b>-L</b> <u>loginprg</u>  This  option  may  be  used  to  specify   a   different   login   program.    By   default,
                    <u>/usr/lib/telnetlogin</u> is used.

       <b>-n</b>           Disable  TCP  keep-alives.   Normally  <b>telnetd</b> enables the TCP keep-alive mechanism to probe
                    connections that have been idle for some period of time to determine if the client is  still
                    there,  so that idle connections from machines that have crashed or can no longer be reached
                    may be cleaned up.

       <b>-N</b>           Disable reverse DNS  lookups  and  use  the  numeric  IP  address  in  logs  and  REMOTEHOST
                    environment variable.

       <b>-s</b>           This  option  is  only  enabled  if  <b>telnetd</b> is compiled with support for SecurID cards.  It
                    causes the <b>-s</b> option to be passed on to <u><a href="../man1/login.1.html">login</a></u>(1),  and  thus  is  only  useful  if  <u><a href="../man1/login.1.html">login</a></u>(1)
                    supports  the  <b>-s</b>  flag  to indicate that only SecurID validated logins are allowed. This is
                    usually useful for controlling remote logins from outside of a firewall.

       <b>-S</b> <u>tos</u>       Sets the IP type-of-service (TOS) option for the telnet connection to the value <u>tos</u>.

       <b>-X</b> <u>authtype</u>  This option is only valid if <b>telnetd</b> has been built  with  support  for  the  authentication
                    option.   It  disables  the  use  of <u>authtype</u> authentication, and can be used to temporarily
                    disable a specific authentication type without having to recompile <b>telnetd</b>.

       <b>-z</b> <u>SSL-parameter</u>
                    This option is only valid if <b>telnetd</b> has been built with SSL (Secure Socket Layer) support.

                    <b>debug</b>       Enable SSL related debugging.

                    <b>debug=</b><u>log_file</u>
                                Select in addition a specific location <u>log_file</u>  for  collecting  debug  output,
                                thus overriding the default file <u>/var/tmp/telnetd.log</u>.

                    <b>ssl</b>         Negotiate  SSL  at  first,  then  use telnet protocol. In this mode telnetd only
                                accepts connections from SSL enhanced telnet with option <b>-z</b> <b>ssl</b>

                    <b>nossl,</b> <b>!ssl</b>
                                switch off SSL negotiation

                    <b>certsok</b>     Look username up in <u>/etc/ssl.users</u>.  The format of this file  is  lines  of  the
                                form:  <u>user1,user2:/C=US/.....</u> where user1 and user2 are usernames and /C=US/...
                                is the subject name of the certificate. Use  <u>openssl</u>  <u>x509</u>  <u>-subject</u>  <u>-noout</u>  to
                                extract  the subject name.  If client certificate is valid, authenticate without
                                password.

                    <b>certrequired</b>
                                client certificate is mandatory

                    <b>secure</b>      Don't switch back to unencrypted mode (no SSL) if SSL is not available.

                    <b>verify=int</b>  Set the SSL verify flags.  (See SSL_VERIFY_* in <u>openssl/ssl.h</u> ).

                    <b>cacert=</b><u>CA_file</u>
                                A collection of trusted authority certificates for verification of whatever  the
                                clients care to send as identifiers.

                    <b>cert=</b><u>cert_file</u>
                                Present  the certificate(s) in <u>cert_file</u> to any client.  They are in PEM-format,
                                and the first certificate identifies the server itself.

                    <b>key=</b><u>key_file</u>
                                Use the key(s) in <u>key_file</u> in case  a  key  is  not  stored  together  with  the
                                certificate.

                    <b>cipher=</b><u>ciph_list</u>
                                Set  the  preferred  ciphers  to <u>ciph_list</u>.  The environment variable SSL_CIPHER
                                serves the same purpose.  (See <u>openssl/ssl.h</u> ).

       If the file <u><a href="file:/etc/issue.net">/etc/issue.net</a></u> is present, <b>telnetd</b> will display its contents before the  login  prompt  of  a
       telnet session (see <u><a href="../man5/issue.net.5.html">issue.net</a></u>(5)).

       <b>Telnetd</b>  operates by allocating a pseudo-terminal device (see <u><a href="../man4/pty.4.html">pty</a></u>(4)) for a client, then creating a login
       process which has the  slave  side  of  the  pseudo-terminal  as  stdin,  stdout,  and  stderr.   <b>Telnetd</b>
       manipulates  the  master  side  of  the  pseudo-terminal,  implementing  the  telnet protocol and passing
       characters between the remote client and the login process.

       When a telnet session is started up, <b>telnetd</b> sends  telnet  options  to  the  client  side  indicating  a
       willingness to do the following telnet options, which are described in more detail below:

             DO AUTHENTICATION
             WILL ENCRYPT
             DO TERMINAL TYPE
             DO TSPEED
             DO XDISPLOC
             DO NEW-ENVIRON
             WILL SUPPRESS GO AHEAD
             DO ECHO
             DO LINEMODE
             DO NAWS
             WILL STATUS
             DO LFLOW
             DO TIMING-MARK

       The pseudo-terminal allocated to the client is configured to operate in cooked mode, and with XTABS CRMOD
       enabled (see <u><a href="../man4/tty.4.html">tty</a></u>(4)).

       <b>Telnetd</b> has support for enabling locally the following telnet options:

       WILL ECHO          When  the  LINEMODE  option  is  enabled, a WILL ECHO or WONT ECHO will be sent to the
                          client to indicate the current state of terminal echoing.  When terminal echo  is  not
                          desired,  a  WILL  ECHO is sent to indicate that telnetd will take care of echoing any
                          data that needs to be echoed to the  terminal,  and  then  nothing  is  echoed.   When
                          terminal  echo  is  desired,  a WONT ECHO is sent to indicate that telnetd will not be
                          doing any terminal echoing, so the client should  do  any  terminal  echoing  that  is
                          needed.

       WILL BINARY        Indicates  that the client is willing to send a 8 bits of data, rather than the normal
                          7 bits of the Network Virtual Terminal.

       WILL SGA           Indicates that it will not be sending IAC GA, go ahead, commands.

       WILL STATUS        Indicates a willingness to send the client, upon request, of the current status of all
                          TELNET options.

       WILL TIMING-MARK   Whenever a DO TIMING-MARK command is received, it is always responded to with  a  WILL
                          TIMING-MARK

       WILL LOGOUT        When  a  DO  LOGOUT  is  received,  a  WILL LOGOUT is sent in response, and the TELNET
                          session is shut down.

       WILL ENCRYPT       Only sent if <b>telnetd</b> is compiled with support for data  encryption,  and  indicates  a
                          willingness to decrypt the data stream.

       <b>Telnetd</b> has support for enabling remotely the following TELNET options:

       DO BINARY          Sent to indicate that telnetd is willing to receive an 8 bit data stream.

       DO LFLOW           Requests that the client handle flow control characters remotely.

       DO ECHO            This is not really supported, but is sent to identify a 4.2BSD <u><a href="../man1/telnet.1.html">telnet</a></u>(1) client, which
                          will  improperly  respond with WILL ECHO. If a WILL ECHO is received, a DONT ECHO will
                          be sent in response.

       DO TERMINAL-TYPE   Indicates a desire to be able to request the name of the  type  of  terminal  that  is
                          attached to the client side of the connection.

       DO SGA             Indicates that it does not need to receive IAC GA, the go ahead command.

       DO NAWS            Requests that the client inform the server when the window (display) size changes.

       DO TERMINAL-SPEED  Indicates  a  desire  to  be able to request information about the speed of the serial
                          line to which the client is attached.

       DO XDISPLOC        Indicates a desire to be able to request the name of the X  windows  display  that  is
                          associated with the telnet client.

       DO NEW-ENVIRON     Indicates  a  desire  to  be  able  to  request  environment  variable information, as
                          described in RFC 1572.

       DO LINEMODE        Only sent if <b>telnetd</b> is compiled with support for  linemode,  and  requests  that  the
                          client do line by line processing.

       DO TIMING-MARK     Only  sent  if <b>telnetd</b> is compiled with support for both linemode and kludge linemode,
                          and the client responded with WONT LINEMODE. If the client responds with WILL TM,  the
                          it is assumed that the client supports kludge linemode.  Note that the [<b>-k</b>] option can
                          be used to disable this.

       DO AUTHENTICATION  Only  sent  if  <b>telnetd</b>  is  compiled with support for authentication, and indicates a
                          willingness to receive authentication information for automatic login.

       DO ENCRYPT         Only sent if <b>telnetd</b> is compiled with support for data  encryption,  and  indicates  a
                          willingness to decrypt the data stream.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Some TELNET commands are only partially implemented.

       Because  of  bugs  in the original 4.2 BSD <u><a href="../man1/telnet.1.html">telnet</a></u>(1), <b>telnetd</b> performs some dubious protocol exchanges to
       try to discover if the remote client is, in fact, a 4.2 BSD <u><a href="../man1/telnet.1.html">telnet</a></u>(1).

       Binary mode has no common interpretation except between similar operating systems (Unix in this case).

       The terminal type name received from the remote client is converted to lower case.

       <b>Telnetd</b> never sends TELNET IAC GA (go ahead) commands.

       The source code is not comprehensible.
