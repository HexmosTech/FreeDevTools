</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pm-action - Suspend or Hibernate your computer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>pm-hibernate</b> [--help]

       <b>pm-suspend</b> [--quirk-*] [--help]

       <b>pm-suspend-hybrid</b> [--quirk-*] [--help]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>pm-action</b>, <b>pm-hibernate</b>, <b>pm-suspend</b> and <b>pm-suspend-hybrid</b>
       commands. This manual page was originally written for the Debian(TM) distribution and has been adopted by
       the pm-utils project.

       These commands can be used to put the machine in a sleep state. The precise way how this is done can be
       influenced by installing executables and configuration snippets. For some options external programs are
       needed.

       These commands will usually be called by <b>UPower</b> or <b>hald</b> when triggered to do so by a program in a desktop
       session such as <b>gnome-power-manager</b>. Calling them from the command line is also possible, but it is not
       guaranteed that all programs in your desktop session keep working as expected.

       <b>pm-suspend</b>
           During suspend most devices are shutdown, and system state is saved in RAM. The system still requires
           power in this state. Most modern systems require 3 to 5 seconds to enter and leave suspend, and most
           laptops can stay in suspend mode for 1 to 3 days before exhausting their battery.

       <b>pm-hibernate</b>
           During hibernate the system is fully powered off, and system state is saved to disk. The system does
           not require power, and can stay in hibernate mode indefinitely. Most modern systems require 15 to 45
           seconds to enter and leave hibernate, and entering and leaving hibernate takes longer when you have
           more memory.

       <b>pm-suspend-hybrid</b>
           Hybrid-suspend is the process where the system does everything it needs to hibernate, but suspends
           instead of shutting down. This means that your computer can wake up quicker than for normal
           hibernation if you do not run out of power, and you can resume even if you run out of power.
           <a href="../man8/s2both.8.html">s2both</a>(8) is an hybrid-suspend implementation.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       On some hardware putting the video card in the suspend state and recovering from it needs some special
       quirk handling. With the --quirk-* options of the <b>pm-suspend</b> and <b>pm-suspend-hybrid</b> commands you can
       select which quirks should be used.

       If <b>pm-suspend</b>, <b>pm-hibernate</b>, or <b>pm-suspend-hybrid</b> are invoked without any commandline parameters, they
       will try to grab the correct quirks from the internal quirk database.

       <b>--quirk-dpms-on</b>
           This option forces the video hardware to turn on the screen during resume. Most video adapters turn
           on the screen themselves, but if you get a blank screen on resume that can be turned back on by
           moving the mouse or typing then this option may be useful.

       <b>--quirk-dpms-suspend</b>
           This option forces the video hardware to turn off the screen when suspending. Most video adapters
           seem to do this correctly, but some do not, which wastes lots of power. If your screen is still on
           after successfully suspending you may need to use this option.

       <b>--quirk-radeon-off</b>
           This option forces Radeon hardware to turn off the display during suspend and turn it back on during
           resume. You only need to do this on some old ThinkPads of the '30 series (T30, X31, R32,... ) with
           Radeon video hardware.

       <b>--quirk-s3-bios</b>
           This option calls the video BIOS during S3 resume. Unfortunately, it is not always allowed to call
           the video BIOS at this point, so sometimes adding this option can actually break resume on some
           systems.

       <b>--quirk-s3-mode</b>
           This option initializes the video card into a VGA text mode, and then uses the BIOS to set the video
           mode. On some systems S3 BIOS only initializes the video BIOS to text mode, and so both S3 BIOS and
           S3 MODE are needed.

       <b>--quirk-vbe-post</b>
           This option will attempt to reinitialize the video card when resuming from suspend, using the same
           code the system BIOS uses at boot in order to initialize the video hardware. Not all video cards need
           this, and using this option on systems where it is not needed can cause a system to lock up when
           resuming.

       <b>--quirk-vbemode-restore</b>
           This option will save and restore the current VESA mode which may be necessary to avoid X screen
           corruption. Using this feature on Intel graphics hardware is probably a bad idea.

       <b>--quirk-vbestate-restore</b>
           This option saves and restores some low level hardware state which may be invalid after suspend.

       <b>--quirk-vga-mode-3</b>
           This option will try to force the video card into a standard text mode on resume.

       <b>--quirk-save-pci</b>
           Save the PCI config space for the VGA card.

       <b>--store-quirks-as-lkw</b>
           Save the quirks the video adaptor required by <b>pm-suspend</b> or <b>pm-suspend-hybrid</b> as an .quirkdb file
           that is specific to this system. The file will be saved in
           /var/cache/pm-utils/last_known_working.quirkdb. This parameter will only save the actual quirks that
           were used to successfully suspend/resume a system, and will be specific to the exact configuration of
           that system, including the video hardware, video driver, and whether or not kernel modesetting was
           used. If the system configuration changes, like after a kernel upgrade, this file will be
           overwritten.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/pm/config.d
           The files in this directory are evaluated in C sort order. These files can be provided by individual
           packages outside of pm-utils. If a global configuration variable is set, the value set to will be
           appended to the previous value. If any other variable is set, it will be ignored. The syntax is
           simply: VAR_NAME=value. See the CONFIGURATION VARIABLES section for valid variables defined by
           pm-utils. External packages can define others, see their respective documentation for more
           information.

       <a href="file:/etc/pm/sleep.d">/etc/pm/sleep.d</a>, <a href="file:/usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d">/usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d</a>
           Programs in these directories (called hooks) are combined and executed in C sort order before suspend
           and hibernate with as argument 'suspend' or 'hibernate'. Afterwards they are called in reverse order
           with argument 'resume' and 'thaw' respectively. If both directories contain a similar named file, the
           one in <a href="file:/etc/pm/sleep.d">/etc/pm/sleep.d</a> will get preference. It is possible to disable a hook in the distribution
           directory by putting a non-executable file in <a href="file:/etc/pm/sleep.d">/etc/pm/sleep.d</a>, or by adding it to the HOOK_BLACKLIST
           configuration variable.

       /var/log/pm-suspend.log
           The log file shows what was done on the last suspend/hibernate and resume/thaw.

</pre><h4><b>SLEEP</b> <b>HOOK</b> <b>ORDERING</b> <b>CONVENTION</b></h4><pre>
       00 - 49
           User and most package supplied hooks. If a hook assumes that all of the usual services and userspace
           infrastructure is still running, it should be here.

       50 - 74
           Service handling hooks. Hooks that start or stop a service belong in this range. At or before 50,
           hooks can assume that all services are still enabled.

       75 - 89
           Module and non-core hardware handling. If a hook needs to load/unload a module, or if it needs to
           place non-video hardware that would otherwise break suspend or hibernate into a safe state, it
           belongs in this range. At or before 75, hooks can assume all modules are still loaded.

       90 - 99
           Reserved for critical suspend hooks.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration variables defined by pm-utils. These can be set in any file in /etc/pm/config.d/.

       <b>SLEEP_MODULE</b> <b>[=kernel]</b>
           The default suspend backend to use. Valid values are:

           <u>kernel</u>
               The built-in kernel suspend/resume support. Use this if nothing else is supported on your system.
               The kernel backend is always used if nothing else is available.

           <u>uswsusp</u>
               If your system has support for the userspace suspend programs (s2ram/s2disk/s2both), then use
               this.

           <u>tuxonice</u>
               If your system has support for tuxonice/suspend2, use this.

       <b>HIBERNATE_RESUME_POST_VIDEO</b> <b>[=no]</b>
           If video should be posted after hibernate, just like after suspend. You should not normally need to
           set this.

       <b>SUSPEND_MODULES</b>
           Space separated list of modules to unload before suspend.

       <b>HOOK_BLACKLIST</b>
           Space separated list of hooks that should be disabled.

       <b>ADD_PARAMETERS</b>
           Space separated list of command line parameters that should be added. If special quirks are needed
           for your system, you can add them here.

       <b>DROP_PARAMETERS</b>
           Space separated list of command line parameters that should be ignored. If particular quirks are
           causing problems for your system, you can add them here. If you want to remove all parameters use
           <u>all</u>.

       <b>HIBERNATE_MODE</b>
           Default method to power down the system when hibernating. If not set, the system will use the kernel
           default as a default value. Check <a href="file:/sys/power/disk">/sys/power/disk</a> for valid values. The default value will be
           surrounded by [square brackets].

       <b>NEED_CLOCK_SYNC</b>
           If your system clock drifts across a suspend/resume or hibernate/thaw cycle, you should set this to
           true. This will cause pm-utils to synchronize the system clock whenever going through a sleep/wake
           cycle at the expense of making suspend/resume take longer.

       <b>PM_HIBERNATE_DELAY</b> <b>[=900]</b>
           If you are using kernel suspend/resume and invoke <b>pm-suspend-hybrid</b>, this environment variable
           controls how many seconds the system will wait after going into suspend before waking back up and
           hibernating. By default, this is set to 900 seconds (15 minutes).

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       Return values less than 128 mean that pm-action failed before trying to put the system in the requested
       power saving state. A return value of 128 means that pm-action tried to put the machine in the requested
       power state but failed. A return value greater than 128 means pm-action encountered an error and also
       failed to enter the requested power saving state.

</pre><h4><b>DEBUGGING</b></h4><pre>
       Debugging suspend/resume can be a tricky process, and is covered in more detail in
       /usr/share/doc/pm-utils/README.debugging.
