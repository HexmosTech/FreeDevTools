</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       apcsmart-old - Driver for American Power Conversion Smart Protocol UPS equipment

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apcsmart-old</b> -h

       <b>apcsmart-old</b> -a <u>UPS_NAME</u> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]

           <b>Note</b>

           This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the apcsmart-old driver. For
           information about the core driver, see <b><a href="../man8/nutupsdrv.8.html">nutupsdrv</a></b>(8).

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       apcsmart-old should recognize all recent APC models that use a serial protocol at 2400 bps. This is
       primarily the Smart-UPS, Matrix-UPS and Back-UPS Pro lines.

       The driver attempts to support every bell and whistle of the APC reporting interface, whether or not this
       is strictly sensible.

       Some older hardware may only report a handful of variables. This is usually not a bug—they just don’t
       support anything else.

</pre><h4><b>CABLING</b></h4><pre>
       This driver expects to see a 940-0024C cable or a clone by default. You can switch to the 940-0095B
       dual-mode cable support with the cable= definition described below.

       If your 940-0024C cable is broken or missing, use this diagram to build a clone:

       https://www.networkupstools.org/cables/940-0024C.jpg

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       This driver supports the following optional settings in the <b><a href="../man5/ups.conf.5.html">ups.conf</a></b>(5):

       <b>cable=940-0095B</b>
           Configure the serial port for the APC 940-0095B dual-mode cable.

       <b>sdtype=</b><u>num</u>
           Use shutdown type <u>num</u>, according to this table:

           0
               soft shutdown or powerdown, depending on battery status

           1
               soft shutdown followed by powerdown

           2
               instant power off

           3
               power off with grace period

           4
               "force OB" hack method for CS 350

       Modes 0 and 1 will power up the load when power returns. Modes 2 and 3 will keep the load turned off when
       the power returns.

       Mode 4 exploits an oddity in the CS 350 models since they only seem to support the S command, but then
       only when running on battery. As a result, the driver will force the UPS to go on battery if necessary
       before sending the shutdown command. This ensures that the load gets reset.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Some older APC UPS models return bogus data in the status register during a front panel test. This is
       usually detected and discarded, but some other unexpected values have occasionally slipped through.

       APC UPS models with both USB and serial ports require a power cycle when switching from USB communication
       to serial, and perhaps vice versa.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Nigel Metheringham &lt;<a href="mailto:Nigel.Metheringham@Intechnology.co.uk">Nigel.Metheringham@Intechnology.co.uk</a>&gt; (drawing heavily on the original apcsmart
       driver by Russell Kroll).

       This driver was called newapc for a time and was renamed in the 1.5 series.

       In 2.6.2 the driver was renamed to apcsmart-old, being superseded by updated version with new features
       which currently holds the apcsmart name.
