       twinstar - Control the Twinstar feature of a Xorcom Astribank

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       twinstar {status|jump|enable-wd|disable-wd|ports}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>twinstar</b> is a tool to control the Twinstar (dual USB port) of a Xorcom Astribank. There is a single and
       mandatory argument which is the command to run. That command operates on all the Astribanks connected to
       the system.

       Technically all the commands are implemented using Dahdi::Xpp::Mpp which in turn uses astribank_tool.
       Thus using thus tool will require root permissions or otherwise read/write permissions to the USB device.

       The twinstar may be in <u>watchdog</u> <u>mode</u>, which means that it will jump to the remote host if it loses
       contact with the local host. This can happen if the machine is powered down or hangs or even if the xpp
       drivers are unloaded. Which is why the standard twinstar scripts put the Astribanks in twinstar mode on
       startup and remove it on normal shutdown.

       An Astribank will only jump to the other host (either if asked explicitly or by the watchdog) only if
       there is a different Astribank connected to the other port and running. Which is why all of this has no
       effect on systems that don't need this functionality.

       The command are:

   <b>status</b>
       Shows the current status of all Astribanks. Note that it only shows Astribanks whose current active USB
       port is the one connected to this computer.

       Example output:

        DEVICE          PORT       WATCHDOG        POWER0     POWER1
        usb:001/010     0          on              yes        yes
        usb:001/011     0          on              yes        yes

       For each Astribank on the system that has Twinstar support we get:

       Device
           The  address  of  the  device.  This  is  the  bus  address,  e.g.  the  address  you  see in lsusb /
           dahdi_hardware.

       Port
           The active USB port on the Astribank. This should be always '0' on the master and  always  1  on  the
           slave.

       Watchdog
           <u>on</u> if the watchdog is triggered in the Atribank or <u>off</u> otherwise.

       Power0, Power1
           Shows  which  ports  of  this  Astribank are connected to a USB port of a running computer. This only
           shows whether or not the USB host provides power.

   <b>ports</b>
       Shows the same 'Port' column of the <b>status</b> command.

   <b>jump</b>
       Command all the Astribanks to jump to the other port. This works regardless the watchdog mode is  enabled
       or not. But requires that there is power on the other port.

   <b>enable-wd</b>
       Enables watchdog mode.

   <b>disable-wd</b>
       Disables watchdog mode.

       <b>twinstar</b> mostly uses astribank_tool which in turn mostly uses USB files under /dev/bus/usb .
