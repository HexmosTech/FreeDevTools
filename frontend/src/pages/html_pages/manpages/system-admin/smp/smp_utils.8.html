       smp_* - invoke a SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP) function

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>smp_*</b>   [<u>--expected=EX</u>]   [<u>--help</u>]   [<u>--hex</u>]  [<u>--interface=PARAMS</u>]  [<u>--raw</u>]  [<u>--sa=SAS_ADDR</u>]  [<u>--verbose</u>]
       [<u>--version</u>] <u>SMP_DEVICE[,N]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) is a transport (also known as a interconnect) used by storage systems.  A  SAS
       system is made up of Host Bus Adapters (HBAs typically containing SCSI initiators), disks (referred to in
       SCSI  as  both  targets  and  logical  units)  and optionally some switching hardware called "expanders".
       Expanders are not SCSI devices so a new protocol was required to control and monitor them. The protocol's
       full name is the SAS Serial Management Protocol which is abbreviated to SMP.

       smp_utils is a package of utilities. Each utility sends an SMP function request to a <u>SMP_DEVICE</u>  (an  SMP
       target).  Some  utilities  may  invoke the same function more than once. If an error occurs then an error
       message is sent to stderr. If no error occurs, the response is decoded (the default), output in ASCII hex
       (when <u>--hex</u> is given) or output in binary to stdout (when the <u>--raw</u> option is given).

       If <u>SMP_DEVICE[,N]</u> is not given then the value in the environment variable SMP_UTILS_DEVICE is used.

       This package was originally written for Linux and has been ported to FreeBSD and Solaris.

</pre><h4><b>LINUX</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       Currently there are multiple interfaces that allow SMP functions to be passed through to an SMP target.

       One method is to have a <u>SMP_DEVICE</u> which is actually the SMP initiator (e.g.  '/dev/mptctl,0').  In  this
       case the SMP target's SAS address must be supplied with the <u>--sa=SAS_ADDR</u> option.

       Another  method  is  to  have  a <u>SMP_DEVICE</u> which represents the SMP target.  In this case no <u>SAS_ADDRESS</u>
       needs to be given (since it is implicit).

       Each utility in smp_utils attempts to work out which  interface  it  has  been  given  by  examining  the
       <u>SMP_DEVICE</u> file. There are three interfaces supported currently:

       <b>aac</b>    This  specifies  the  aacraid  SAS  pass-through  associated  with  Adaptec/PMC RAID products. The
              <u>SMP_DEVICE[,N]</u> argument takes the form <u>/dev/aac[N[,E_ID]]</u> where "N" is the raid controller  number
              (typically  0)  and "E_ID" is the expander identifier (typically 0); both default to 0 so <u>/dev/aac</u>
              is  equivalent  to  <u>/dev/aac0</u>  and  <u>/dev/aac0,0</u>  .   The   "N"   is   the   unique_id   found   in
              <a href="file:/sys/class/scsi_host">/sys/class/scsi_host</a>&lt;HN&gt;/unique_id  .   The  "HN"  is the host number which is the first number to
              appear on each line in the lsscsi utility which by default uses one line to list  each  accessible
              SCSI  device  (typically  SCSI  or  ATA disks). The "E_ID" is the expander identifier which can be
              found with the Adaptec/PMC arcconf utility using the form "arcconf expanderlist  &lt;ControllerNum&gt;".
              The  &lt;ControllerNum&gt;s  start  at 1 . If an aac RAID controller is present then the /dev/acc device
              node will be created by the first smp utility to use this interface.

       <b>mpt</b>    This specifies the MPT fusion SAS pass-through. The mptsas driver uses  the  '/dev/mptctl'  device
              node  (character  device  major 10, minor 220) while the mpt2sas driver uses '/dev/mpt2ctl' device
              node  (major  10,  minor  221).   For  the  mpt3sas  driver  the  corresponding  device  node   is
              '/dev/mpt3ctl'.   The  'modprobe mptctl' or 'modprobe mpt2ctl' command may be needed. If there are
              multiple mpt fusion controllers (HBAs) in the computer, then the user will need to  specify  which
              one to use with the syntax: '/dev/mptctl,&lt;n&gt;' where &lt;n&gt; is the "ioc_num". This number can be found
              with  dmesg after the mptsas driver is registered and appears as a suffix to the driver name (e.g.
              mpt2sas0). It can also be found in '/sys/class/scsi_host/host&lt;n&gt;/unique_id'.  When this  interface
              is used the <u>--sa=SAS_ADDR</u> option must be given to specify the SAS address of the SMP target.

       <b>sgv4</b> (<b>sg</b>)
              This  interface  is  more  generic  and supported by several SAS HBA drivers including mptsas (and
              mpt2sas). It was introduced in the Linux 2.6.24 kernel. The SMP functions are passed to the kernel
              via the bsg driver using a format known as "SCSI Generic Version 4" which gives this interface its
              name: "sgv4" or just "sg". The SAS transport layer within the  SCSI  sub-system  unpacks  the  SMP
              requests and forwards them to SAS low level drivers that support this interface. The <u>SMP_DEVICE</u> is
              either  a member of the '<a href="file:/sys/class/bsg">/sys/class/bsg</a>' directory (e.g. /sys/class/bsg/expander-6:0 ) or a device
              node made for the bsg driver (e.g. /dev/bsg/expander-6:0 ). Such device nodes  are  dynamic  (i.e.
              they  don't  have  fixed  major  and  minor  numbers) and should correspond to the major and minor
              numbers found in the 'sys/class/bsg/&lt;smp_target_device&gt;<a href="file:/dev">/dev</a>' file.

</pre><h4><b>FREEBSD</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       The CAM subsystem  has  been  enhanced  in  FreeBSD  9  to  pass-through  SMP  requests  and  return  the
       corresponding  responses. However CAM does not directly access expander devices because they are not SCSI
       devices. It makes the assumption that each SAS expander has an integrated SES (enclosure) device and that
       is addressed. This assumption seems to be true for SAS-2 expanders but not  some  SAS-1  expanders.  Thus
       invocations look like this:

         # smp_discover /dev/ses0

       where /dev/ses0 is a SES device associated with a SAS expander.

</pre><h4><b>SOLARIS</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       The USMP pass-through mechanism is used. Invocations look like this:

         # smp_rep_manufacturer /dev/smp/expd0

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       If  the device name is not given then the SMP_UTILS_DEVICE environment variable is checked and if present
       its contents are used as the device name.

       If the SAS address (of the SMP target) is not given and it is required (i.e.  it is not implicit  in  the
       device  name) then the SMP_UTILS_SAS_ADDR environment variable is checked and if present its contents are
       used as the SAS address. SAS addresses are usually given in hex indicated by a leading '0x'  or  trailing
       'h'.

       A  device  slot number (dsn) is important for establishing the relationship between an expander phy and a
       SES array element. Newer expanders (e.g. SAS-3)  support  dsn_s  in  the  DISCOVER  (and  DISCOVER  LIST)
       functions.  These can be shown, if available, with the --dsn option to smp_discover and smp_discover_list
       utilities.. To ease typing that option often, the SMP_UTILS_DSN environment variable, if present, has the
       same effect.

       If both an environment variable and the corresponding command line option is given and  contradict,  then
       the command line options take precedence.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options  are  mandatory  for short options as well.  If an option takes a
       numeric argument then that argument is assumed to be decimal unless  otherwise  indicated  (e.g.  with  a
       leading "0x" or a trailing "h").

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--expected</b>=<u>EX</u>
              revision  4a  of  the SAS-2 draft introduced an 'expected expander change count' field in some SMP
              requests. The idea is to detect other SMP initiators trying to change the state  of  an  expander.
              The  value <u>EX</u> is from 0 to 65535 inclusive with 0 being the default value. When <u>EX</u> is greater than
              zero then if the value doesn't match the expander  change  count  of  the  SMP  target  (i.e.  the
              expander)  when the request arrives then the target ignores the request and sets a function result
              of "invalid expander change count" in the response.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              output the usage message for the utility then exit.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b>
              output the response in hexadecimal. This does not include the trailing CRC field.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--interface</b>=<u>PARAMS</u>
              interface specific parameters. This option is usually not  needed  since  the  interface  type  is
              guessed  by  a utility based on the characteristics of the given <u>SMP_DEVICE</u> argument or what is in
              the corresponding environment variables. <u>PARAMS</u> is  of  the  form:  <u>INTF[,force]</u>.   If  the  guess
              doesn't  work  then  the  interface  can  be specified by giving a <u>INTF</u> of either 'mpt' or 'sgv4'.
              Sanity checks are still performed and a utility may refuse if it  doesn't  agree  with  the  given
              <u>INTF</u>.  If  the  user is really sure then adding a ',force' will force the utility to use the given
              interface.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>
              send the response to stdout in binary. This does not include the trailing  CRC  field.  All  error
              messages are sent to stderr.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--sa</b>=<u>SAS_ADDR</u>
              specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device. Typically this is an expander. This option may
              not  be  needed if the <u>SMP_DEVICE</u> has the target's SAS address associated with it. The <u>SAS_ADDR</u> is
              in decimal but most SAS addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in hexadecimal either
              prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it. If this option is not given then the value in the
              environment variable SMP_UTILS_SAS_ADDR is used.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print the version string and then exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       To aid scripts that call these utilities, the exit status is set to indicate success (0) or failure (1 or
       more):

       <b>0</b>      success

       <b>1</b> <b>-</b> <b>63</b> reserved for SMP function result codes. See the SAS-2 (or later) draft,  in  the  section  on  the
              application  layer,  drilling  down further: management application layer then SMP functions. Here
              are some common function result codes: 1 [unknown SMP function], 2 [SMP function failed], 16  [phy
              does  not  exist],  17  [index  does  not  exist], 18 [phy does not support SATA], 19 [unknown phy
              operation], 22 [phy vacant] and 35 [zone lock violation].

       <b>91</b>     syntax error. Either illegal options, options with bad arguments or a combination of options  that
              is not permitted.

       <b>92</b>     the  utility  is  unable to open, close or use the given <u>SMP_DEVICE</u>.  The given file name could be
              incorrect or there may be file permission problems. Adding the  <u>--verbose</u>  option  may  give  more
              information.

       <b>93</b>     the  utility  has a resource problem. Typically this means an attempt to allocate memory (ram) has
              failed.

       <b>97</b>     the response to an SMP function failed sanity checks.

       <b>99</b>     any error that can't be categorized into values 1 to 97  may  yield  this  value.   This  includes
              transport and operating system errors.

       <b>126</b>    the  utility was found but could not be executed. That might occur if the executable does not have
              execute permissions.

       <b>127</b>    This is the exit status for utility not found. That might occur when a script calls a  utility  in
              this  package but the PATH environment variable has not been properly set up, so the script cannot
              find the executable.

       <b>128</b> <b>+</b> <b>&lt;signum&gt;</b>
              If a signal kills a utility then the exit status is 128 plus the signal number. For example  if  a
              segmentation  fault occurs then a utility is typically killed by SIGSEGV which according to 'man 7
              signal' has an associated signal number of 11; so the exit status will be 139 .

       <b>255</b>    the utility tried to yield an exit status of 255 or larger. That should not happen; given here for
              completeness.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Finding the SAS address of an expander can be a challenge in some environments. An  enclosure  containing
       one or more expanders may have the expander SAS address(es) printed on the back of the device, a bit like
       Ethernet MAC addresses.

       In  the  Linux  2.6  kernel  series  the expander SAS address may well be in the sysfs tree but it is not
       always easy to find. Doing this search may help:

         # find <a href="file:/sys">/sys</a> -name "*expander*"

       That should show the suffix on  any  expanders  that  have  been  detected.  Then  a  command  like  'cat
       /sys/class/sas_device/expander-6:0/sas_address' should show its SAS address.

       Another  approach is to work backwards from SCSI devices (i.e. logical units). The protocol specific port
       log page (log page 18h) contains fields for the "attached SAS address".  The  sg_logs  utility  from  the
       sg3_utils package could be used like this:

         # sg_logs --page=18h /dev/sdb

       Any given "attached SAS address" is either a HBA, an expander or 0 indicating that port is not connected.
       An expander is indicated by "attached device type: expander device". A SAS disk's target port identifiers
       (also known as SAS addresses), device name and logical unit name (all NAA 5 format) can be found with the
       sg_vpd  utility  (e.g. 'sg_vpd -i &lt;disk_dev&gt;'). The sdparm utility can provide the same information (e.g.
       'sdparm -i &lt;disk_dev&gt;').

       A SAS expander is often associated with a SCSI Enclosure Services (SES)  device  sometimes  on  the  same
       silicon  attached via a virtual phy to the expander. That SES device may be able to access and control an
       attached enclosure or backplane via SGPIO or I2C on sideband signals  (e.g.  in  a  SFF-8087  cable).  To
       interact with a SES device, see the sg_ses utility.

       Often  expander  phys are grouped in fours on the same connector (e.g.  SFF-8088). Care needs to be taken
       when multiple expanders are interconnected.  An enclosure <b>universal</b> port is one in which  the  "table  to
       table supported" attribute is set (in the REPORT GENERAL response) and the associated phys have the table
       routing attribute (in the DISCOVER response). Enclosure <b>universal</b> ports were introduced in SAS-2 and have
       few  restrictions  when  used  to interconnect expanders or connect SAS or SATA devices. An enclosure <b>out</b>
       port is one in which the "table to table supported" attribute is clear and the associated phys  have  the
       table  routing  attribute.  An enclosure <b>in</b> port is one in which the associated phys have the subtractive
       routing attribute. When <b>universal</b> ports are not available, an expander interconnect should be between  an
       <b>in</b> port and an <b>out</b> port.

</pre><h4><b>CONFORMING</b> <b>TO</b></h4><pre>
       SAS  has  multiple generations. The early standards are: the original SAS (ANSI INCITS 376-2003), SAS 1.1
       (INCITS 417-2006) and SAS-2 (ANSI INCITS 457-2010) . SAS-2.1  work  was  split  into  an  electrical  and
       physical  layers  document  (standardized  as  SAS-2.1  ANSI INCITS 478-2011) with the upper level layers
       placed in a document called the SAS Protocol Layer and it was standardized as SPL ANSI  INCITS  476-2011.
       Next  came  SPL-2  which  was  standardized  as  SPL-2  ANSI  INCITS  505-2013. Then came SPL-3 which was
       standardized as SPL-3 ANSI INCITS 492-2015. SPL-4 is near standardization and its most  recent  draft  is
       spl4r13.pdf  while  SPL-5 work has started and its most recent draft is spl5r03.pdf. To lessen confusion,
       the multiple generations of SAS will be referred to in these man pages as SAS 1, 1.1,  2,  2.1  (SPL),  3
       (SPL-2  and  SPL-3),  4  (SPL-4)  and 5 (SPL-5).  Roughly speaking for the electrical and physical layers
       standards SAS-1 runs at 3 Gbps, SAS-2 at 6 Gbps, SAS-3 at 12  Gbps  and  SAS-4  at  22.5  Gbps.   Drafts,
       including  those  just  prior  to  standardization  can  be  found  at  the <a href="http://www.t10.org">http://www.t10.org</a> site (e.g.
       spl-r07.pdf and spl2r04c.pdf). INCITS policy now requires a registration to view these  drafts,  a  break
       from t10.org tradition.

       The  two  utilities  for  reading  and  writing  to GPIO registers, smp_read_gpio and smp_write_gpio, are
       defined in the Small Form Factor document SFF-8485  found  at  <a href="http://www.sffcommittee.com">http://www.sffcommittee.com</a>  .  "Enhanced"
       versions  of  the  corresponding SMP functions have been mentioned in some drafts but no definitions have
       been published and the references have been removed in more recent drafts.

       In this section of each utility's man page is the first standard in which  the  associated  SMP  function
       appeared and whether there have been significant additions in later standards.

       The  COVERAGE file in the smp_utils source tarball shows a table of all SMP function names defined in the
       drafts, the versions of those standards in which those SMP functions first appeared and the corresponding
       smp_utils utility names. A lot of extra SMP functions have been added in SAS-2 associated with zoning.
