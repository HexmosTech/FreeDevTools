</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dropbear - lightweight SSH server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dropbear</b> [<u>flag</u> <u>arguments</u>] [-b <u>banner</u>] [-r <u>hostkeyfile</u>] [-p [<u>address</u>:]<u>port</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dropbear</b> is a small SSH server

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b> <u>banner</u>
              bannerfile.  Display the contents of the file <u>banner</u> before user login (default: none).

       <b>-r</b> <u>hostkey</u>
              Use  the  contents  of  the  file  <u>hostkey</u>  for  the  SSH  hostkey.   This  file is generated with
              <b><a href="../man1/dropbearkey.1.html">dropbearkey</a></b>(1) or automatically with the '-R' option. See "Host Key Files" below.

       <b>-R</b>     Generate hostkeys automatically. See "Host Key Files" below.

       <b>-F</b>     Don't fork into background.

       <b>-E</b>     Log to standard error rather than syslog.

       <b>-e</b>     Pass on the server environment to all child processes. This is required, for example, if  Dropbear
              is  launched  on  the fly from a SLURM workload manager. The environment is not passed by default.
              Note that this could expose secrets in environment variables from the calling process -  use  with
              caution.

       <b>-m</b>     Don't display the message of the day on login.

       <b>-w</b>     Disallow root logins.

       <b>-s</b>     Disable password logins.

       <b>-g</b>     Disable password logins for root.

       <b>-t</b>     Enable  two-factor authentication. Both password login and public key authentication are required.
              Should not be used with the '-s' option.

       <b>-j</b>     Disable local port forwarding. This includes unix stream forwards.

       <b>-k</b>     Disable remote port forwarding.

       <b>-p</b> [<u>address</u>:]<u>port</u>
              Listen on specified <u>address</u> and TCP <u>port.</u>  If just a port is given listen on all addresses.  Up to
              10 can be specified (default 22 if none specified).

       <b>-l</b> <u>interface</u>
              Listen on the specified <u>interface</u>

       <b>-i</b>     Service program mode.  Use this option to run <b>dropbear</b> under TCP/IP servers like inetd, tcpsvd, or
              tcpserver.  In program mode the -F option is implied, and -p options are ignored.

       <b>-P</b> <u>pidfile</u>
              Specify a pidfile to  create  when  running  as  a  daemon.  If  not  specified,  the  default  is
              /var/run/dropbear.pid

       <b>-a</b>     Allow remote hosts to connect to forwarded ports.

       <b>-W</b> <u>windowsize</u>
              Specify  the  per-channel  receive  window  buffer  size.  Increasing  this  may  improve  network
              performance at the expense of memory use. Use -h to see the default buffer size.

       <b>-K</b> <u>timeout_seconds</u>
              Ensure that traffic is transmitted at a certain interval in seconds. This is  useful  for  working
              around firewalls or routers that drop connections after a certain period of inactivity. The trade-
              off  is  that  a  session  may  be closed if there is a temporary lapse of network connectivity. A
              setting of 0 disables keepalives. If no response is received  for  3  consecutive  keepalives  the
              connection will be closed.

       <b>-I</b> <u>idle_timeout</u>
              Disconnect the session if no traffic is transmitted or received for <u>idle_timeout</u> seconds.

       <b>-z</b>     By  default  Dropbear  will  send  network  traffic with the <b>AF21</b> setting for QoS, letting network
              devices give it higher priority. Some devices may have problems with  that,  <u>-z</u>  can  be  used  to
              disable it.

       <b>-T</b> <u>max_authentication_attempts</u>
              Set the number of authentication attempts allowed per connection. If unspecified the default is 10
              (MAX_AUTH_TRIES)

       <b>-c</b> <u>forced_command</u>
              Disregard  the command provided by the user and always run <u>forced_command</u>. This also overrides any
              authorized_keys command= option.  The  original  command  is  saved  in  the  SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND
              environment variable (see below).

       <b>-D</b> <u>authorized_keys_dir</u>
              Specify  the  directory  to  use  for  authorized_keys files. The default is <a href="file:~/.ssh">~/.ssh</a> , paths with a
              leading ~/ will be home directory expanded.

       <b>-V</b>     Print the version

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Authorized Keys

              <a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a> can be set up to allow remote login with a RSA, ECDSA, Ed25519 or DSS  key.
              Each line is of the form

       [restrictions] ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIgAsp... [comment]

              and  can  be  extracted  from  a Dropbear private host key with "dropbearkey -y". This is the same
              format as used by OpenSSH, though the restrictions are a subset (keys  with  unknown  restrictions
              are  ignored).   Restrictions  are comma separated, with double quotes around spaces in arguments.
              Available restrictions are:

       <b>no-port-forwarding</b>
              Don't allow port forwarding for this connection, including unix streams.

       <b>no-agent-forwarding</b>
              Don't allow agent forwarding for this connection

       <b>no-X11-forwarding</b>
              Don't allow X11 forwarding for this connection

       <b>no-pty</b> Disable PTY allocation. Note that a user can still obtain most  of  the  same  functionality  with
              other means even if no-pty is set.

       <b>restrict</b>
              Applies all the no- restrictions listed above.

       <b>permitopen=</b>"<u>host:port</u>"
              Restrict  local port forwarding so that connection is allowed only to the specified host and port.
              Multiple permitopen options separated by commas can be set in authorized_keys. Wildcard  character
              ('*')  may be used in port specification for matching any port. Hosts must be literal domain names
              or IP addresses.

       <b>command=</b>"<u>forced_command</u>"
              Disregard the command provided by the user and always run <u>forced_command</u>.   The  -c  command  line
              option overrides this.

              The  authorized_keys  file  and its containing <a href="file:~/.ssh">~/.ssh</a> directory must only be writable by the user,
              otherwise Dropbear will not allow a login using public key authentication.

       Host Key Files

              Host   key   files   are   read   at   startup   from   a   standard    location,    by    default
              /etc/dropbear/dropbear_dss_host_key,                          /etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key,
              /etc/dropbear/dropbear_ecdsa_host_key and /etc/dropbear/dropbear_ed25519_host_key

              If the -r command line option is specified the default files are not loaded.  Host key  files  are
              of the form generated by dropbearkey.  The -R option can be used to automatically generate keys in
              the  default  location  -  keys  will  be  generated  after  startup  when the first connection is
              established. This had the benefit that the system /dev/urandom random number source has  a  better
              chance of being securely seeded.

       Message Of The Day

              By  default  the  file  /etc/motd will be printed for any login shell (unless disabled at compile-
              time). This can also be disabled per-user by creating a file <a href="file:~/.hushlogin">~/.hushlogin</a> .

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Dropbear sets the standard variables USER, LOGNAME, HOME, SHELL, PATH, and TERM.

       The variables below are set for sessions as appropriate.

       <b>SSH_TTY</b>
              This is set to the allocated TTY if a PTY was used.

       <b>SSH_CONNECTION</b>
              Contains "&lt;remote_ip&gt; &lt;remote_port&gt; &lt;local_ip&gt; &lt;local_port&gt;".

       <b>DISPLAY</b>
              Set X11 forwarding is used.

       <b>SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND</b>
              If a 'command=' authorized_keys option was  used,  the  original  command  is  specified  in  this
              variable. If a shell was requested this is set to an empty value.

       <b>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</b>
              Set to a forwarded ssh-agent connection.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Dropbear only supports SSH protocol version 2.
