       backup_kill - Terminates a pending or running operation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>backup</b> <b>kill</b> <b>-id</b> &lt;<u>job</u> <u>ID</u> <u>or</u> <u>dump</u> <u>set</u> <u>name</u>&gt; [<b>-help</b>]

       <b>backup</b> <b>k</b> <b>k</b> <b>-i</b> &lt;<u>job</u> <u>ID</u> <u>or</u> <u>dump</u> <u>set</u> <u>name</u>&gt; [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>backup</b> <b>kill</b> command dequeues a Backup System operation that is pending, or terminates an operation
       that is running, in the current interactive session. It is available only in interactive mode.  If the
       issuer of the <b>backup</b> <b>interactive</b> command included the <b>-localauth</b> flag, the <b>-cell</b> argument, or both, then
       those settings apply to this command also.

       To terminate a dump operation, specify either the dump name (<u>volume_set_name</u>.<u>dump_level_name</u>) or its job
       ID number, which appears in the output from the <b>backup</b> <b>jobs</b> command. To terminate any other type of
       operation, provide the job ID number.

       The effect of terminating an operation depends on the type and current state of the operation:

       •   If  an  operation  is  still  pending,  the  Tape Coordinator removes it from the queue with no other
           lasting effects.

       •   If the Tape Coordinator is unable to process the termination signal before an operation completes, it
           simply confirms the operation's completion. The operator must take the action necessary to  undo  the
           effects of the incorrect operation.

       •   If a tape labeling operation is running, the effect depends on when the Tape Coordinator receives the
           termination  signal.  The  labeling  operation is atomic, so it either completes or does not begin at
           all.  Use the <b>backup</b> <b>readlabel</b> command to determine if the labeling operation completed, and  reissue
           the <b>backup</b> <b>labeltape</b> command to overwrite the incorrect label if necessary.

       •   If  a  tape scanning operation is running, it terminates with no other effects unless the <b>-dbadd</b> flag
           was included on the <b>backup</b> command. In that case, the Backup System possibly has already written  new
           Backup  Database  records to represent dumps on the scanned tape. If planning to restart the scanning
           operation, first locate and remove the records created during the terminated  operation:  a  repeated
           <b>backup</b>  <b>scantape</b>  operation  exits  automatically when it finds that a record that it needs to create
           already exists.

       •   If a dump operation is running, all of the volumes written to the tape or backup data file before the
           termination signal is received are complete and usable. If the operation  is  restarted,  the  Backup
           System  performs  all  the dumps again from scratch, and assigns a new dump ID number. If writing the
           new dumps to the same tape or file, the operator must relabel it first if the interrupted dump is not
           expired. If writing the new dump to a different tape or file, the operator can remove the dump record
           associated with the interrupted dump to free up space in the database.

       •   If a restore operation is running, completely restored volumes are online and usable. However, it  is
           unlikely  that many volumes are completely restored, given that complete restoration usually requires
           data from multiple tapes. If the termination signal comes before the Backup System has  accessed  all
           of the necessary tapes, each volume is only partially written and is never brought online. It is best
           to restart the restore operation from scratch to avoid possible inconsistencies. See also "CAUTIONS".

</pre><h4><b>CAUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       It  is  best  not  to issue the <b>backup</b> <b>kill</b> command against restore operations. If the termination signal
       interrupts a restore operation as the Backup System is overwriting an existing volume, it is possible  to
       lose  the  volume entirely (that is, to lose both the contents of the volume as it was before the restore
       and any data that was restored before the termination signal arrived).  The  data  being  restored  still
       exists on the tape, but some data can be lost permanently.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-id</b> &lt;<u>job</u> <u>ID</u> <u>or</u> <u>dump</u> <u>set</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           Identifies the backup operation to terminate. Provide one of two types of values:

           •   The operation's job ID number, as displayed in the output of the <b>backup</b> <b>jobs</b> command.

           •   For   a   dump   operation,   either   the   job   ID   number   or  a  dump  name  of  the  form
               <u>volume_set_name</u>.<u>dump_level_name</u>, where <u>volume_set_name</u> is the name of the volume set being dumped
               and <u>dump_level_name</u> is the last element in the dump level pathname at which  the  volume  set  is
               being  dumped.  The dump name appears in the output of the <b>backup</b> <b>jobs</b> command along with the job
               ID number.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following command terminates the operation with job ID 5:

          backup&gt; kill 5

       The following command terminates the dump operation called "user.sunday1":

          backup&gt; kill user.sunday1

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>REQUIRED</b></h4><pre>
       The issuer must have the privilege required to initiate  the  operation  being  cancelled.  Because  this
       command  can  be issued only within the interactive session during which the operation was initiated, the
       required privilege is essentially guaranteed.
