</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wpa_supplicant - Wi-Fi Protected Access client and IEEE 802.1X supplicant

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wpa_supplicant</b> [ <b>-BddfhKLqqsTtuvW</b> ] [ <b>-i</b><u>ifname</u> ] [ <b>-c</b><u>config</u> <u>file</u> ] [ <b>-D</b><u>driver</u> ] [ <b>-P</b><u>PID_file</u> ] [ <b>-f</b><u>output</u>
       <u>file</u> ] [ <b>-I</b><u>additional</u> <u>config</u> <u>file</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       Wireless  networks  do  not  require  physical access to the network equipment in the same way that wired
       networks do. This makes it easier for unauthorized users to passively monitor a network and  capture  all
       transmitted frames.  In addition, unauthorized use of the network is much easier. In many cases, this can
       happen  even without user's explicit knowledge since the wireless LAN adapter may have been configured to
       automatically join any available network.

       Link-layer encryption can be used to provide a layer of security  for  wireless  networks.  The  original
       wireless  LAN standard, IEEE 802.11, included a simple encryption mechanism, WEP. However, that proved to
       be flawed in many areas and networks  protected  with  WEP  cannot  be  considered  secure.  IEEE  802.1X
       authentication  and  frequently changed dynamic WEP keys can be used to improve the network security, but
       even that has inherited security issues due to the use of WEP for encryption. Wi-Fi Protected Access  and
       the  IEEE 802.11i amendment to the wireless LAN standard introduce a much improved mechanism for securing
       wireless networks. IEEE 802.11i enabled networks that are using CCMP (an encryption  mechanism  based  on
       the  strong  cryptographic  algorithm  AES)  can finally be called secure and used for applications which
       require efficient protection against unauthorized access.

       <b>wpa_supplicant</b> is an implementation of the WPA Supplicant component, i.e., the  part  that  runs  in  the
       client  stations.  It implements WPA key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator and EAP authentication with
       Authentication Server. In addition, it controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11 authentication/association of
       the wireless LAN driver.

       <b>wpa_supplicant</b> is designed to be a "daemon" program that runs in the background and acts as  the  backend
       component  controlling the wireless connection. <b>wpa_supplicant</b> supports separate frontend programs and an
       example text-based frontend, <b>wpa_cli</b>, is included with wpa_supplicant.

       Before wpa_supplicant can do its work, the network interface must  be  available.  That  means  that  the
       physical  device  must  be  present and enabled, and the driver for the device must be loaded. The daemon
       will exit immediately if the device is not already available.

       After <b>wpa_supplicant</b> has configured the network device, higher level configuration of the device, such as
       DHCP, may proceed.  There are a variety of ways to integrate wpa_supplicant into a  machine's  networking
       scripts, a few of which are described in sections below.

       The following steps are used when associating with an AP using WPA:

       • <b>wpa_supplicant</b> requests the kernel driver to scan neighboring BSSes (Basic Service Set)

       • <b>wpa_supplicant</b> selects a BSS based on its configuration

       • <b>wpa_supplicant</b> requests the kernel driver to associate with the chosen BSS

       • If  WPA-EAP:  integrated  IEEE  802.1X  Supplicant completes EAP authentication with the authentication
         server (proxied by the Authenticator in the AP)

       • If WPA-EAP: master key is received from the IEEE 802.1X Supplicant

       • If WPA-PSK: <b>wpa_supplicant</b> uses PSK as the master session key

       • <b>wpa_supplicant</b> completes WPA 4-Way Handshake and Group Key Handshake with the Authenticator (AP)

       • <b>wpa_supplicant</b> configures encryption keys for unicast and broadcast

       • normal data packets can be transmitted and received

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       In most common cases, <b>wpa_supplicant</b> is started with:

              wpa_supplicant -B -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -iwlan0

       This makes the process fork into the background.

       The easiest way to debug problems, and to get a debug log for bug reports, is to start <b>wpa_supplicant</b>  in
       the foreground with debugging enabled:

              wpa_supplicant -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -iwlan0 -d

       If  the  specific  driver  wrapper  is  not  known  beforehand,  it is possible to specify multiple comma
       separated driver wrappers on the command line. <b>wpa_supplicant</b> will use the first driver wrapper  that  is
       able to initialize the interface.

              wpa_supplicant -Dnl80211,wext -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -iwlan0

       <b>wpa_supplicant</b>  can control multiple interfaces (radios) either by running one process for each interface
       separately or by running just one process and  list  of  options  at  command  line.  Each  interface  is
       separated  with  -N  argument.  As  an  example,  following  command  would  start wpa_supplicant for two
       interfaces:

              wpa_supplicant \
                   -c wpa1.conf -i wlan0 -D nl80211 -N \
                   -c wpa2.conf -i ath0 -D wext

</pre><h4><b>OS</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Current hardware/software requirements:

       • Linux kernel 2.6.30 or higher with nl80211/cfg80211 support

       • Linux kernel 2.4.x or higher with Linux Wireless Extensions v15 or newer

       • FreeBSD 6-CURRENT

       • Microsoft Windows with WinPcap (at least WinXP, may work with other versions)

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>DRIVERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Linux</b> <b>nl80211/cfg80211</b>
              This is the preferred driver for Linux.

       <b>Linux</b> <b>wireless</b> <b>extensions</b>
              In theory, any driver that supports Linux wireless extensions can be used with IEEE 802.1X  (i.e.,
              not WPA) when using ap_scan=0 option in configuration file.

       <b>Wired</b> <b>Ethernet</b> <b>drivers</b>
              Use ap_scan=0.

       <b>BSD</b> <b>net80211</b> <b>layer</b> <b>(e.g.,</b> <b>Atheros</b> <b>driver)</b>
              At the moment, this is for FreeBSD 6-CURRENT branch.

       <b>Windows</b> <b>NDIS</b>
              The current Windows port requires WinPcap (<a href="http://winpcap.polito.it/">http://winpcap.polito.it/</a>).  See README-Windows.txt for
              more information.

       wpa_supplicant  was  designed  to  be  portable  for  different drivers and operating systems. Hopefully,
       support for more wlan cards and OSes will be added in the future. See developer.txt for more  information
       about  the  design  of wpa_supplicant and porting to other drivers. One main goal is to add full WPA/WPA2
       support to Linux wireless extensions to allow new drivers to be supported without having to implement new
       driver-specific interface code in wpa_supplicant.

</pre><h4><b>ARCHITECTURE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>wpa_supplicant</b> system consists of the following components:

       <u>wpa_supplicant.conf</u>
              the configuration file describing all networks that the user wants the computer to connect to.

       <b>wpa_supplicant</b>
              the program that directly interacts with the network interface.

       <b>wpa_cli</b>
              the client program that provides a high-level interface to the functionality of the daemon.

       <b>wpa_passphrase</b>
              a utility needed to construct <u>wpa_supplicant.conf</u> files that include encrypted passwords.

</pre><h4><b>QUICK</b> <b>START</b></h4><pre>
       First, make a configuration file, e.g.  <u>/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf</u>, that describes  the  networks  you  are
       interested in.  See <b><a href="../man5/wpa_supplicant.conf.5.html">wpa_supplicant.conf</a></b>(5) for details.

       Once  the  configuration is ready, you can test whether the configuration works by running <b>wpa_supplicant</b>
       with following command to start it on foreground with debugging enabled:

              wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -d

       Assuming everything goes fine,  you  can  start  using  following  command  to  start  <b>wpa_supplicant</b>  on
       background without debugging:

              wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -B

       Please  note  that  if  you  included  more  than  one  driver  interface in the build time configuration
       (.config), you may need to specify which interface to use by including  -D&lt;driver  name&gt;  option  on  the
       command line.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b> <b>TO</b> <b>PCMCIA-CS/CARDMRG</b></h4><pre>
       For example, the following small changes to pcmcia-cs scripts can be used to enable WPA support:

       Add MODE="Managed" and WPA="y" to the network scheme in <u>/etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts</u>.

       Add the following block to the end of <b>start</b> action handler in <u>/etc/pcmcia/wireless</u>:

              if [ "$WPA" = "y" -a -x /usr/local/bin/wpa_supplicant ]; then
                  /usr/local/bin/wpa_supplicant -B -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -i$DEVICE
              fi

       Add  the  following block to the end of <b>stop</b> action handler (may need to be separated from other actions)
       in <u>/etc/pcmcia/wireless</u>:

              if [ "$WPA" = "y" -a -x /usr/local/bin/wpa_supplicant ]; then
                  killall wpa_supplicant
              fi

       This will make <b>cardmgr</b> start <b>wpa_supplicant</b> when the card is plugged in.
