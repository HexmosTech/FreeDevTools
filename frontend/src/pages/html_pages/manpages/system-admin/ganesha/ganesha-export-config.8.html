       ganesha-export-config - NFS Ganesha Export Configuration File

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          /etc/ganesha/ganesha.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       NFS-Ganesha obtains configuration data from the configuration file:
          /etc/ganesha/ganesha.conf

       This file lists NFS-Ganesha Export block config options.

   <b>EXPORT</b> <b>PERMISSIONS</b>
       These  options  are  all "export permissions" options, and are available in EXPORT_DEFAULTS {}, EXPORT {}
       and CLIENT {} blocks.

       These options will all be dynamically updateable.

       <b>Access_Type(enum,</b> <b>default</b> <b>None)</b>

              <b>Possible</b> <b>values:</b>
                     None, RW, RO, MDONLY, MDONLY_RO

       <b>Protocols(enum</b> <b>list,</b> <b>default</b> <b>none)</b>

              <b>Possible</b> <b>values:</b>
                     3, 4, NFS3, NFS4, V3, V4, NFSv3, NFSv4, 9P

       Transports(enum list, values [UDP, TCP, RDMA], default [UDP, TCP])

       Anonymous_uid(anonid, range INT32_MIN to UINT32_MAX, default -2)

       Anonymous_gid(anonid, range INT32_MIN to UINT32_MAX, default -2)

       <b>SecType(enum</b> <b>list,</b> <b>default</b> <b>[none,</b> <b>sys])</b>

              <b>Possible</b> <b>values:</b>
                     none, sys, krb5, krb5i, krb5p

       PrivilegedPort(bool, default false)

       Manage_Gids(bool, default false)

       <b>Squash(enum,</b> <b>default</b> <b>root_sqaush)</b>

              <b>Possible</b> <b>values:</b>
                     root, root_squash,  rootsquash,  rootid,  root_id_squash,  rootidsquash,  all,  all_squash,
                     allsquash, all_anomnymous, allanonymous, no_root_squash, none, noidsquash

              Each line of defaults above are synonyms

       <b>NFS_Commit(bool,</b> <b>default</b> <b>false)</b>

       <b>Delegations(enum,</b> <b>default</b> <b>None)</b>

              <b>Possible</b> <b>values:</b>
                     None, read, write, readwrite, r, w, rw

   <b>CLIENT</b> <b>{}</b>
       CLIENT blocks are used in EXPORT_DEFAULTS {}, EXPORT {}, and PSEUDOFS {} blocks.

       Each CLIENT block provides a list of clients and the permissions granted those clients. These blocks form
       an ordered "access control list" for the export. If no client block matches for a particular client, then
       the  permissions  in  the  EXPORT  {}  block will be used (and if any permissions are not set between the
       CLIENT and the EXPORT, then the permissions set in EXPORT_DEFAULTS will be used and  if  still  not  set,
       then the code default will be used.

       If  an  EXPORT does not have any CLIENT blocks then the list of CLIENT blocks in EXPORT_DEFAULTS (if any)
       will be used. No matter the source of the CLIENT blocks, if the client matches none, then the permissions
       in the EXPORT will be applied next.

       To override a restrictive default client list with "everyone" a non-empty client list would  have  to  be
       specified. Clients = "*" would do the trick.

       Even  when  a  CLIENT  block  matches a client, if a particular export permission is not explicit in that
       CLIENT block, the permission specified in the EXPORT block will be used, or if not specified there,  from
       the  EXPORT_DEFAULTS  block,  and if not specified there, the permission will default to the default code
       value noted in the permission option descriptions above.

       Note that when the CLIENT blocks are processed on config reload, a new client access list is  constructed
       and atomically swapped in. This allows adding, removing, and re-arranging clients as well as changing the
       access for any give client.

       CLIENT  blocks use all the EXPORT PERMISSIONS options (except PSEUDOFS CLIENT blocks which are limited to
       the same options the PSEUDOFS block is allowed) plus:

       <b>Clients(client</b> <b>list,</b> <b>empty)</b>
              Client list entries can take on one of the following forms. This  parameter  may  be  repeated  to
              extend the list.
                 *           Match  any  client @name       Netgroup name x.x.x.x/y   IPv4 network address, IPv6
                 addresses are also allowed
                     but the format is too complex to show here

                 <b>wildcarded</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>string</b> <b>contains</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>?</b> <b>or</b> <b>*</b>
                        character (and is not simply "*"), the string is used to pattern match host names.  Note
                        that [] may also be used, but the pattern MUST have at least one ? or *

                 <b>hostname</b> <b>Match</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>client</b> <b>(match</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address,</b> <b>all</b>
                        addresses  returned  by  getaddrinfo  will match, the getaddrinfo call is made at config
                        parsing time)

                 IP address  Match a single client

   <b>EXPORT_DEFAULTS</b> <b>{}</b>
       All the EXPORT PERMISSIONS options plus:

       <b>Attr_Expiration_Time(int32,</b> <b>range</b> <b>-1</b> <b>to</b> <b>INT32_MAX,</b> <b>default</b> <b>60)</b>

       <b>CLIENT</b> <b>(optional)</b>
              See the <b>CLIENT</b>  <b>{}</b> block description.  There may be any number of these.

   <b>EXPORT_DEFAULTS</b> <b>{</b> <b>CLIENT</b> <b>{}</b> <b>}</b>
       See the <b>CLIENT</b>  <b>{}</b> block description.

   <b>EXPORT</b> <b>{}</b>
       All options below are dynamically changeable with config update unless specified below. This block may be
       repeated to define multiple exports.

       All the EXPORT_PERMISSIONS plus:

       <b>Export_id</b> <b>(required):</b>
              An identifier for the export, must be  unique  and  between  0  and  65535.   If  Export_Id  0  is
              specified, Pseudo must be the root path (/).

              Export_id  is  not dynamic per se, changing it essentially removes the old export and introduces a
              new export.

       <b>Path</b> <b>(required)</b>
              The directory in the exported file system this export is  rooted  on  (may  be  ignored  for  some
              FSALs). It need not be unique if Pseudo and/or Tag are specified.

              Note  that  if it is not unique, and the core option mount_path_pseudo is not set true, a v3 mount
              using the path will ONLY be able to access the first export configured. To  access  other  exports
              the Tag option would need to be used.

              This option is NOT dynamically updateable since it fundamentally changes the export. To change the
              path exported, export_id should be changed also.

       <b>Pseudo</b> <b>(required</b> <b>v4)</b>
              This option specifies the position in the Pseudo Filesystem this export occupies if this is an NFS
              v4  export.  It  must  be unique. By using different Pseudo options, the same Path may be exported
              multiple times.

              This option is used to place the export within the NFS v4 Pseudo Filesystem. This creates a single
              name space for NFS v4. Clients may mount the  root  of  the  Pseudo  Filesystem  and  navigate  to
              exports.  Note that the Path and Tag options are not at all visible to NFS v4 clients.

              Export id 0 is automatically created to provide the root and any directories necessary to navigate
              to  exports  if  there  is  no  other export specified with Pseudo = /;. Note that if an export is
              specified with Pseudo = /;, it need not be export id 0. Specifying such an export with FSAL { name
              = PSEUDO; } may be used to create a Pseudo Filesystem with specific options. Such  an  export  may
              also  use  other  FSALs (though directories to reach exports will ONLY be automatically created on
              FSAL PSEUDO exports).

              This option is dynamically changeable and changing it will  move  the  export  within  the  pseudo
              filesystem.  This  may be disruptive to clients. Note that if the mount_path_pseudo NFS_CORE_PARAM
              option is true, the NFSv3 mount path will also change (that should not be  disruptive  to  clients
              that have the export mounted).

       <b>Tag</b> <b>(no</b> <b>default)</b>
              This  option allows an alternative access for NFS v3 mounts. The option MUST not have a leading <a href="file:/.">/.</a>
              Clients may not mount subdirectories (i.e. if Tag = foo, the client may  not  mount  foo/baz).  By
              using different Tag options, the same Path may be exported multiple times.

              This option is not dynamically updatable.

       <b>Filesystem_id(fsid,</b> <b>format</b> <b>is</b> <b>uint64.uint64,</b> <b>default</b> <b>unused)</b>
              This option allows overriding the filesystem ID provided by the underlying filesystem. Use of this
              option  is  discouraged,  It will not work if VFS or GPFS is exporting a filesystem that has other
              filesystems mounted on sub-directories and exported with the same export.

              This option is not dynamically updateable.

       <b>Read_Access_Check_Policy(enum,</b> <b>values</b> <b>[pre,</b> <b>post,</b> <b>all],</b> <b>default</b> <b>pre)</b>
              Whether to run permission check for read before sending the read to the FSAL,  after  getting  the
              read  response  from  the FSAL, or both before and after.  This allows to optimize performance for
              failure flow by always checking access before sending the read, or  to  optimize  performance  for
              success  path  by  storing  access  check result in the FSAL cache during the read and perform the
              access check after the read (requires the FSAL implementation to support it,  so  should  only  be
              used  with  supported  FSALs).  It also allow to optimize for security by running permission check
              both before and after.

       <b>MaxRead</b> <b>(64*1024*1024)</b>
              The maximum read size on this export

       <b>MaxWrite</b> <b>(64*1024*1024)</b>
              The maximum write size on this export

       <b>PrefRead</b> <b>(64*1024*1024)</b>
              The preferred read size on this export. Note that some older nfs client (e.g.  libnfs  1.x)  would
              not  handle  well  for large preferred read size. If so, please try to decrease this size (usually
              less than 1M is suitable for older nfs client).

       <b>PrefWrite</b> <b>(64*1024*1024)</b>
              The preferred write size on this export. Note that some older nfs client (e.g. libnfs  1.x)  would
              not  handle  well for large preferred write size. If so, please try to decrease this size (usually
              less than 1M is suitable for older nfs client).

       <b>PrefReaddir</b> <b>(16384)</b>
              The preferred readdir size on this export

       <b>MaxOffsetWrite</b> <b>(INT64_MAX)</b>
              Maximum file offset that may be written Range is 512 to UINT64_MAX

       <b>MaxOffsetRead</b> <b>(INT64_MAX)</b>
              Maximum file offset that may be read Range is 512 to UINT64_MAX

       DisableReaddirPlus(bool, default false)

       Trust_Readdir_Negative_Cache(bool, default false)

       The following options may have limits on dynamic effect

       <b>UseCookieVerifier(bool,</b> <b>default</b> <b>true)</b>
              Updating UseCookieVerifier while a readdir is in progress may result in unexpected behavior.

       <b>Disable_ACL(bool,</b> <b>default</b> <b>false)</b>
              Disable_ACL is processed at create_export time currently  which  makes  it  effectively  a  static
              option.

       Security_Label(bool, default false)

       <b>Attr_Expiration_Time(int32,</b> <b>range</b> <b>-1</b> <b>to</b> <b>INT32_MAX,</b> <b>default</b> <b>60)</b>
              Attr_Expiration_Time  is evaluated when an MDCACHE entry is created, so the dynamic effect of this
              option may be constrained to new entries.

       <b>CLIENT</b> <b>(optional)</b>
              See the <b>CLIENT</b>  <b>{}</b> block description.  There may be any number of these.

       <b>FSAL</b> <b>(required)</b>
              See the <b>EXPORT</b> <b>{</b> <b>FSAL</b>  <b>{}</b> <b>}</b> block.

              The FSAL for an export can not be changed dynamically. In order to change the FSAL, a  new  export
              must be created.

              At this time, no FSAL actually supports any updatable options.

   <b>EXPORT</b> <b>{</b> <b>CLIENT</b> <b>{}</b> <b>}</b>
       See the <b>CLIENT</b>  <b>{}</b> block description.

   <b>EXPORT</b> <b>{</b> <b>FSAL</b> <b>{}</b> <b>}</b>
       NFS-Ganesha supports the following FSALs: <b>Ceph</b> <b>Gluster</b> <b>GPFS</b> <b>PROXY_V3</b> <b>PROXY_V4</b> <b>RGW</b> <b>VFS</b> <b>XFS</b> <b>LUSTRE</b> <b>LIzardFS</b>
       <b>KVSFS</b>

       Refer to individual FSAL config file for list of config options.

       The FSAL blocks generally are less updatable

   <b>PSEUDOFS</b> <b>{}</b>
       This  block  allows specifying some options for the pseudofs root export. It is very similar to an EXPORT
       block, except only the following options may be specified. CLIENT blocks may be used just like an  EXPORT
       block, however, they are also limited to the same options.

       This  is  basically a shortcut rather than having to fill out options in an EXPORT block. Note that Path,
       Pseudo, and Export_Id are not included as those values will be fixed  ("/"  for  the  paths,  and  0  for
       Export_Id). Other options that don't make sense for the pseudofs root are also not allowed.

       An empty PSEUDOFS {} block will produce the same default pseudofs root export as generated if no pseudofs
       root export is otherwise specified.

       This block is most useful to override a restrictive CLIENT list in EXPORT_DEFAULTS {}.

       These options will all be dynamically updateable.

       <b>Access_Type(enum,</b> <b>default</b> <b>MDONLY_RO)</b>

              <b>Possible</b> <b>values:</b>
                     None, MDONLY_RO

       Transports(enum list, values [UDP, TCP, RDMA], default [TCP])

       <b>SecType(enum</b> <b>list,</b> <b>default</b> <b>[none,</b> <b>sys,</b> <b>krb5,</b> <b>krb5i,</b> <b>krb5p])</b>

              <b>Possible</b> <b>values:</b>
                     none, sys, krb5, krb5i, krb5p

       PrivilegedPort(bool, default false)

       <b>Export_id(uint16,</b> <b>range</b> <b>0</b> <b>to</b> <b>UINT16_MAX,</b> <b>default</b> <b>0)</b>
              An identifier for the export, must be unique and between 0 and 65535.

              Export_id  is  not dynamic per se, changing it essentially removes the old export and introduces a
              new export.

       <b>Filesystem_id(fsid,</b> <b>format</b> <b>is</b> <b>uint64.uint64,</b> <b>default</b> <b>152.152)</b>
              Unlike standard exports, there is no underlying filesystem to get an ID from, so  this  option  is
              important, however the default value may be used so it need not be specified.

              This option is not dynamically updateable.

       DisableReaddirPlus(bool, default false)

       Trust_Readdir_Negative_Cache(bool, default false)

       The following options may have limits on dynamic effect

       <b>UseCookieVerifier(bool,</b> <b>default</b> <b>true)</b>
              Updating UseCookieVerifier while a readdir is in progress may result in unexpected behavior.

   <b>PSEUDOFS</b> <b>{</b> <b>CLIENT</b> <b>{}</b> <b>}</b>
       See  the  <b>CLIENT</b>   <b>{}</b> block description but note that beyond the Clients options that works as described,
       the other options available are as for the PSEUDOFS {} block.

       If it is desired to override a restrictive CLIENT list in EXPORT_DEFAULTS, the following  PSEUDOFS  could
       be  defined  that will give all clients the default access to the pseudofs root that otherwise would have
       been granted if EXPORT_DEFAULTS was not used.

       <b>PSEUDOFS</b> <b>{</b>

              <b>CLIENT</b> <b>{</b>
                     Clients =
                     *
                     ;

              }

       }

</pre><h4><b>DISCUSSION</b></h4><pre>
       The EXPORT blocks define the file namespaces that are served by NFS-Ganesha.

       In best practice, each underlying filesystem has a single EXPORT defining how that filesystem  is  to  be
       shared,  however,  in  some  cases, it is desirable to sub-divide a filesystem into multiple exports. The
       danger when this is done is that rogue clients may be able to spoof file handles and access  portions  of
       the filesystem not intended to be accessible to that client.

       Some  FSALs  (currently  FSAL_VFS,  FSAL_GPFS,  FSAL_XFS,  and  FSAL_LUSTRE)  are built to support nested
       filesystems, for example:
          /export/fs1 /export/fs1/some/path/fs2

       In this case, it is possible to create a single export that exports both filesystems. There is a  lot  of
       complexity of what can be done there.

       In  discussions  of  filesystems, btrfs filesystems exported by FSAL_VFS may have subvolumes. Starting in
       NFS-Ganesha V4.0 FSAL_VFS treats these as separate filesystems that are integrated with all the  richness
       of FSAL_VFS exports.

       Another  significant FSAL from an export point of view is FSAL_PSEUDO. This is used to build glue exports
       to build the unified NFSv4 name space. This name  space  may  also  be  used  by  NFSv3  by  setting  the
       NFS_CORE_PARAM option:
          mount_path_pseudo = TRUE;

       If no FSAL_PSEUDO export is explicitly defined, and there is no EXPORT with:
          Pseudo = "/";

       NFS-Ganesha  will  build  a  FSAL_PSEUDO EXPORT with this Pseudo Path using Export_Id = 0. This automatic
       EXPORT may be replaced with an explicit EXPORT which need not have Export_Id  =  0,  it  just  must  have
       Pseudo = "/" and Protocols = 4.

       In  building the Pseudo Filesystem, there is a subtle gotcha. Since NFSv4 clients actually mount the root
       of the Pseudo Filesystem and then use LOOKUP to traverse into  the  actual  directory  the  sysadmin  has
       mounted  from  the  client,  any EXPORTs from "/" to the desired EXPORT MUST have Protocols = 4 specified
       either in EXPORT_DEFAULTS {}, EXPORT {}, or EXPORT { CLIENT {} }.  This is to assure that the  client  is
       allowed to traverse each EXPORT.

       If  Mount_Path_Pseudo  = TRUE is being used and an export is desired to be NFSv3 only, Protocols = 3 MUST
       be specified in the EXPORT {} block. If Protocols is not specified in the EXPORT {}  block  and  is  only
       specified  in  an  EXPORT  {  CLIENT  {}  }  block,  then that export will still be mounted in the Pseudo
       Filesystem but might not be traversable. Thus if the following two filesystems are exported:
          /export/fs1 /export/fs1/some/path/fs2

       And the EXPORTs look something like this:
          EXPORT {
              Export_Id = 1; Path = /export/fs1; Pseudo = /export/fs1;

              FSAL {
                 Name = VFS;

              }

              CLIENT {
                 Clients="*"; Protocols=3;

              }

          }

          EXPORT {
              Export_Id = 1; Path = /export/fs1/some/path/fs2; Pseudo = /export/fs1/some/path/fs2;

              FSAL {
                 Name = VFS;

              }

              CLIENT {
                 Clients="*"; Protocols=3,4;

              }

          }

       NFSv4 clients will not be able to access /export/fs1/some/path/fs2. The correct way  to  accomplish  this
       is:
          EXPORT {
                 Export_Id = 1; Path = /export/fs1; Pseudo = /export/fs1; Protocols=3;

              <b>FSAL</b>

                     <b>{</b>      Name = VFS;

                     }

          }

       Note that an EXPORT { CLIENT {} } block is not necessary if the default export permissions are workable.

       Note  that  in order for an EXPORT to be usable with NSFv4 it MUST either have Protocols = 4 specified in
       the EXPORT block, or the EXPORT block must not have the Protocols option at all such that it defaults  to
       3,4,9P.  Note  though  that if it is not set and EXPORT_DEFAULTS just has Protocols = 3; then even though
       the export is mounted in the Pseudo Filesystem, it will not be accessible and the gotcha discussed  above
       may be in play.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>RELOAD</b></h4><pre>
       In  addition  to the LOG {} configuration, EXPORT {} config is the main configuration that can be updated
       while NFS-Ganesha is running by issuing a SIGHUP.

       This causes all EXPORT and EXPORT_DEFAULTS blocks to be reloaded. NFS-Ganesha V4.0 and  later  have  some
       significant  improvements  to  this  since it was introduced in NFS-Ganesha V2.4.0. V2.8.0 introduced the
       ability to remove EXPORTs via SIGHUP configuration reload.

       Significantly how things work now is:

       On SIGHUP all the EXPORT and EXPORT_DEFAULTS blocks are re-read. There  are  three  conditions  that  may
       occur:
          An export may be added An export may be removed An export may be updated

       A  note  on  Export_Id  and  Path.  These  are the primary options that define an export. If Export_Id is
       changed, the change is treated as a remove of the old Export_Id and an addition  of  the  new  Export_Id.
       Path  can not be changed without also changing Export_Id. The Tag and Pseudo options that also contribute
       to the uniqueness of an EXPORT may be changed.

       Any removed exports are removed from the internal tables and if they are NFSv4  exports,  unmounted  from
       the Pseudo Filesystem, which will then be re-built as if those exports had not been present.

       Any  new exports are added to the internal tables, and if the export is an NFSv4 export, they are mounted
       into the Pseudo Filesystem.

       Any updated exports will be modified with the least disruption possible. If the Pseduo option is changed,
       the export is unmounted from the Pseduo Filesystem in it's original location, and re-mounted in it's  new
       location.  Other  options  are  updated  atomically,  though serially, so for a short period of time, the
       options may be mixed between old and new. In most cases this should not cause problems.  Notably  though,
       the  CLIENT  blocks  are  processed to form a new access control list and that list is atomically swapped
       with the old list. If the Protocols for an EXPORT are changed to include  or  remove  NFSv4,  the  Pseduo
       Filesystem will also be updated.

       Note  that  there  is  no pause in operations other than a lock being taken when the client list is being
       swapped out, however the export permissions are applied to an operation once. Notably for NFSv4, this  is
       on  a  PUTFH  or  LOOKUP which changes the Current File Handle. As an example, if a write is in progress,
       having passed the permission check with the previous export permissions, the write will complete  without
       interruption.  If  the  write  is  part  of an NFSv4 COMPOUND, the other operations in that COMPOUND that
       operate on the same file handle will also complete with the previous export permissions.

       An update of EXPORT_DEFAULTS changes the export options atomically. These options are only used for those
       options not otherwise set in an EXPORT {} or CLIENT {} block and are applied when export permissions  are
       evaluated when a new file handle is encountered.

       The FSAL { Name } may not be changed and FSALs offer limited support for changing any options in the FSAL
       block.  Some  FSALs may validate and warn if any options in the FSAL block are changed when such a change
       is not supported.
