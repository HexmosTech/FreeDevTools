</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf</u> - Configuration file for laptop-mode-tools.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  documents  the  options  that  can  be  set  in the <u>/etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf</u>
       configuration file and in the modular configuration files in the <u>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d</u> directory. For a
       description of what laptop mode does, see the <a href="../man8/laptop_mode.8.html">laptop_mode</a>(8) manual page.

</pre><h4><b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The syntax of options is <b>OPTION=value</b>. There are some groups of options that specify values depending  on
       power  state and laptop mode is enabled. These use the prefix "LM_" to indicate that a value is used only
       when laptop mode is enabled, "NOLM_" to indicate the opposite, "AC_" to indicate that  a  value  is  used
       only  when  the system is running on AC power, and "BATT_" to indicate that a value is used only when the
       system is running on batteries. Settings are prefixed with a combination of an optional LM_/NOLM_  prefix
       and  an optional AC_/BATT_. For instance, the combination LM_AC_ means "when the system is in laptop mode
       and on AC power". (Note that this situation happens only if <b>ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_ALWAYS</b> is enabled!) If one
       of the prefixes (either LM_/NOLM_ or AC_/BATT_) is missing, then the value is used independently  of  the
       state  of  laptop mode or AC power, respectively. Options that start with "CONTROL_" are boolean settings
       that determine whether laptop mode tools is allowed to control a certain aspect of your  system.  Boolean
       settings  always  expect  "0" to indicate the false (negative/no/disabled) value, and "1" to indicate the
       true (positive/yes/enabled) value.

       The following sections list the settings that are  available  in  laptop-mode.conf  and  in  the  modular
       configuration files.

       <b>Note:</b>  Many  settings were moved from the main configuration file to the modular configuration files. The
       settings here are split out by modular configuration file, but in  installations  upgraded  from  version
       1.36  or  earlier  they  may  appear  in  both.  In  such  cases,  the configuration settings in the main
       configuration file override those in the modular configuration files. To avoid confusion, it  is  advised
       to  move  the  settings  from  the  main configuration files to the modular configuration files when this
       situation is detected.

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/board-specific/</b></u>
       The board-specific settings framework is for users and distributors who would like to  ship  their  local
       customized settings on top of the default settings shipped upstream.

       Add local customized settings under this folder to override the system defaults.

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf</b></u>
       This  is  the main configuration file. It contains the settings for enabling and disabling, plus the core
       features: the Linux kernel laptop mode feature and related settings.

       <b>ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_TOOLS</b>
                 This module determines if laptop-mode-tools should be run or not. Default is 1 Set it to  0  if
                 you would like to completely disable laptop-mode-tools

       <b>VERBOSE_OUTPUT</b>
                 Set  this  to 1 if you want to see a lot of output when you start/stop laptop mode, and to 0 if
                 you don't want this. Useful for debugging purposes.

       <b>LOG_TO_SYSLOG</b>
                 Set this to 1 if you want to log messages to syslog when you start/stop laptop mode, and  to  0
                 if you don't want this. Useful for debugging purposes.

       <b>DEBUG</b>     Set  this  to  1  if  you  would  like to execute the entire laptop-mode program in debug mode.
                 WARNING: This will create a lot of text output. If you  are  debugging  an  individual  module,
                 perhaps  you  would  want  to  enable each module specific debug mode (available in module conf
                 files)

       <b>ENABLE_AUTO_MODULES</b>
                 Set this to 1 to enable all laptop mode tools modules that are termed safe to  be  enabled  and
                 are  marked auto.  With this option alone, you can enable all auto modules. In case you need to
                 fine-control the behavior of individual modules, you can modify them accordingly. Default is 1

       <b>ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_ON_BATTERY</b>

       <b>ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_ON_AC</b>
                 These options determine whether laptop mode will be activated when the computer is  on  battery
                 or  on AC power, respectively. Note that if the system service laptop-mode is not started, then
                 laptop mode will never be started, even if this option is enabled.

                 The ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_ON_AC setting is useful when you want to run on a headless  machine,  in
                 low-power mode, for eg. a Jukebox.

       <b>ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_WHEN_LID_CLOSED</b>
                 When  this  option  is  enabled, laptop mode will be activated when the laptop's lid is closed,
                 even if the system is not working on batteries. Note that if the system service laptop-mode  is
                 not  started,  then  laptop  mode  will never be started, even if this option is enabled.  This
                 feature is only supported on ACPI.

       <b>MINIMUM_BATTERY_CHARGE_PERCENT</b>
                 The minimum number of battery minutes, charge (in mAh) or charge (in mWh) that you want to have
                 available while your laptop is in laptop mode. When the number of minutes/mAhs/mWhs goes  below
                 this  value,  the  data  loss  sensitive  features  are  automatically disabled. Note that some
                 batteries do not report a discharge rate,  which  means  that  MINIMUM_BATTERY_MINUTES  has  no
                 effect for these batteries. These options are only supported on ACPI.

       <b>DISABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_ON_CRITICAL_BATTERY_LEVEL</b>
                 If  this  option  is enabled, the data loss sensitive features of laptop mode are disabled when
                 the battery reports its state as "critical". This option is only supported on ACPI.

       <b>DISABLE_BATTERY_ALARM_CHECK</b>
                 If this option is enabled, the alarm values are ignored from the battery. This  is  helpful  if
                 you have a broken battery which is reporting false alarms.

       <b>HD</b>        The  hard  drives  which laptop mode should operate upon. If you have multiple hard drives, you
                 should list them all in this option, separated by spaces, for example: "/dev/hda /dev/hdb".

       <b>PARTITIONS</b>
                 This option specifies the partitions or mount points that  laptop  mode  should  operate  upon.
                 Separate  the  partitions  or mount points by spaces. You can include the entry "auto" to stand
                 for the partitions on the hard drives specified in the HD option.

       <b>LM_BATT_MAX_LOST_WORK_SECONDS</b>

       <b>LM_AC_MAX_LOST_WORK_SECONDS</b>
                 The maximum number of seconds worth of data that you can lose when power runs out or  when  the
                 computer  crashes.  This  is  the maximum number of seconds that laptop mode will keep modified
                 data in memory without being written to disk. (Note that the NOLM value is  missing:  modifying
                 this  value  when laptop mode is disabled is extremely useless, as it won't save you any power,
                 and will only lose you work.)

       <b>CONTROL_READAHEAD</b>
                 When this option is enabled, laptop mode tools controls the readahead  on  the  filesystems  it
                 works upon.

       <b>LM_READAHEAD</b>

       <b>NOLM_READAHEAD</b>
                 The  number  of kilobytes to "read ahead" on your hard disks. Reading ahead means that whenever
                 some data is read from disk, the data which is most likely to be accessed next is read as well,
                 ahead of time. This then saves a hard disk spinup when the data is actually needed, because the
                 data is then already in memory. Don't set this value too high, because the readahead applies to
                 all files that are read!

       <b>CONTROL_NOATIME</b>
                 When this option is enabled, laptop mode tools places the "noatime" option in the mount options
                 of your filesystems when laptop mode is active. This option has the effect of disabling  access
                 time  logging  on  files, which may save some disk activity. If you use programs that depend on
                 access times (e.g., mutt), then you should disable this  option,  or  enable  the  <b>USE_RELATIME</b>
                 option.

       <b>USE_RELATIME</b>
                 When  this  option  is enabled together with the <b>CONTROL_NOATIME</b> option, laptop mode tools will
                 use the relatime option instead of the noatime option. This option works for more applications,
                 and still causes relatively low levels of disk writes.  Note that this  functionality  is  only
                 available in recent kernel versions, and laptop mode tools will ignore this setting for kernels
                 before 2.6.23.

       <b>CONTROL_HD_IDLE_TIMEOUT</b>
                 When  this  option is enabled, laptop mode tools adjusts your hard drives' idle timeouts, i.e.,
                 the time of inactivity before they spin down.

       <b>LM_AC_HD_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS</b>

       <b>LM_BATT_HD_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS</b>

       <b>NOLM_HD_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS</b>
                 These settings control the idle timeout for your hard  drives.  The  values  are  specified  in
                 seconds.  Values up to 20 minutes can be represented accurately by the hardware, anything above
                 that is rounded down to half-hour precision. Use the value 0 to disable idle timeout.

       <b>CONTROL_HD_POWERMGMT</b>
                 When  this  option  is  enabled,  laptop  mode tools adjusts your hard drives' power management
                 settings.

       <b>BATT_HD_POWERMGMT</b>

       <b>LM_AC_HD_POWERMGMT</b>

       <b>NOLM_AC_HD_POWERMGMT</b>
                 These values specify the power management level for your hard drives.   The  legal  values  for
                 these options can be found in the <a href="../man8/hdparm.8.html">hdparm</a>(8) manual page, in the documentation of the <b>-B</b> option.

       <b>CONTROL_HD_WRITECACHE</b>
                 When this option is enabled, laptop mode tools controls your hard drives' write cache settings.

       <b>NOLM_AC_HD_WRITECACHE</b>

       <b>NOLM_BATT_HD_WRITECACHE</b>

       <b>LM_HD_WRITECACHE</b>
                 These options specify whether the write caches should be enabled for your hard drives.

       <b>CONTROL_SYSLOG_CONF</b> (deprecated)
                 When  this  option  is  enabled, laptop mode tools controls <u>/etc/syslog.conf</u> as a symlink. This
                 option is deprecated. Use the configuration-file-control module instead, which is configured in
                 the <u>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/configuration-file-control.conf</u> module configuration file.

   <b>Advanced</b> <b>laptop-mode.conf</b> <b>options</b>
       These options normally do not need to be modified from their default values. Do not tweak these  settings
       unless you know what you are doing.

       <b>ASSUME_SCSI_IS_SATA</b>
                 This  option, enabled by default, tells laptop mode tools to assume that a device /dev/sdX is a
                 SATA device, and that it should be controlled using hdparm. If your /dev/sdX drives are  really
                 SCSI drives, disable this option.

       <b>ACPI_WITHOUT_AC_EVENTS</b>
                 Enable  this option if you have a laptop with a buggy ACPI implementation that doesn't send out
                 AC adapter events. Enabling this option will make  laptop  mode  check  the  AC  adapter  state
                 whenever  the battery state changes, which achieves just about the same effect as responding to
                 AC adapter events.

       <b>CONTROL_MOUNT_OPTIONS</b>
                 When this option is enabled, laptop mode tools is allowed to control the mount options for your
                 filesystems. Disabling this will break <b>CONTROL_NOATIME</b>, but it will most  probably  also  break
                 laptop  mode  itself,  as changes to the mount options are crucial for achieving spun-down hard
                 drives.

       <b>LM_DIRTY_RATIO</b>

       <b>NOLM_DIRTY_RATIO</b>
                 This option specifies the percentage of system memory that  is  allowed  to  contain  unwritten
                 modified data when laptop mode is active.

       <b>LM_DIRTY_BACKGROUND_RATIO</b>

       <b>NOLM_DIRTY_BACKGROUND_RATIO</b>
                 This  option  specifies  the  percentage  of system memory that is allowed to contain unwritten
                 modified data after the DIRTY_RATIO barrier has been crossed.  The effect  of  this  option  is
                 that  when  more  than  DIRTY_RATIO  percent  of memory contains modified data, the system will
                 synchronously write back data until only  DIRTY_BACKGROUND_RATIO  percent  of  memory  contains
                 modified data.

       <b>DEF_UPDATE</b>

       <b>DEF_XFS_AGE_BUFFER</b>

       <b>DEF_XFS_SYNC_INTERVAL</b>

       <b>DEF_XFS_BUFD_INTERVAL</b>

       <b>DEF_MAX_AGE</b>
                 These  options  contain  the  default (non-laptop-mode) values for some kernel options that are
                 modified when laptop mode is active. You do not normally need to change these,  they  represent
                 the normal kernel defaults.

       <b>XFS_HZ</b>    This  option specifies the number of units in a second that is utilized by a 2.4 kernel. If you
                 run a 2.4 kernel with an XFS filesystem on non-Intel hardware, you need to change  this  option
                 to  reflect the kernel "ticks per second" value, which is the kernel variable HZ. Unfortunately
                 this is not exposed anywhere, so you'll have to specify it manually.

       <b>LM_SECONDS_BEFORE_SYNC</b>
                 The number of seconds that laptop mode waits after the disk goes idle before it starts  a  full
                 sync.  This  should  always  be less than your hard disk idle timeout, because otherwise you'll
                 have a sync directly after your drive spins down. Two seconds is usually a good value for  this
                 option.

       <b>XFS_HZ</b>    This option expresses the unit of the XFS tuning parameters. The default is 100. This option is
                 only useful for 2.4 kernels that have a value for HZ that is not 100. In the 2.6 kernel series,
                 the  XFS interfaces were modified to always use USER_HZ (which is currently always 100), so for
                 these kernels you do not need to modify this value. Also, on 2.4 kernels the value of HZ is 100
                 for the most common architectures, so you need only change this value if you use a less  common
                 architecture.

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/ethernet.conf</b></u>
       The  ethernet  module  allows  you to control the behavior of your ethernet devices during AC and battery
       states.

       <b>CONTROL_ETHERNET</b>
                 Enable this to control various aspects of power savings in the ethernet devices.

       <b>BATT_THROTTLE_ETHERNET=1</b>

       <b>LM_AC_THROTTLE_ETHERNET=0</b>

       <b>NOLM_AC_THROTTLE_ETHERNET=0</b>
                 These options specify the power states in which you would like to control the ethernet device

       <b>THROTTLE_SPEED</b>
                 Here, you can specify the throttling speed for your ethernet device. The default is  "slowest".
                 Valid  values are "slowest", "fastest" or the speed of your ethernet device, like 1000. To know
                 the exact speed of your ethernet device, you can use the ethtool tool.

       <b>DISABLE_WAKEUP_ON_LAN</b>
                 This setting controls the  option  to  enable/disable  the  WoL  (Wake  On  LAN)  feature.   It
                 permanently  disables  the  WOL  feature  on the ethernet device. Default is 1.  Set it to 0 to
                 enable the WOL feature.

       <b>ETHERNET_DEVICES</b>
                 Specify the list of ethernet devices to control. Defaults to eth0

       <b>DISABLE_ETHERNET_ON_BATTERY</b>
                 Set this to 1 if you want to completely disable your ethernet device when running  on  battery,
                 and when no carrier is detected on the interface (e.g., no active cable is plugged in). Default
                 is 0

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/cpuhotplug.conf</b></u>
       The cpuhotplug module allows you to switch off the CPU cores when running on battery

       <b>CONTROL_CPU_HOTPLUG</b>
                 When this option is enabled, Laptop Mode Tools can hotplug your CPU, thus switching it offline,
                 and conserving some power.  NOTE: This module is NOT enabled by default

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/cpufreq.conf</b></u>
       The cpufreq module allows you to control the Linux kernel's CPU frequency scaling settings.

       <b>CONTROL_CPU_FREQUENCY</b>
                 When this option is enabled, laptop mode tools controls your CPU's frequency scaling bounds and
                 the scaling governor. This option is currently only supported on 2.6 kernels.

       <b>BATT_CPU_MAXFREQ</b>

       <b>BATT_CPU_INFREQ</b>

       <b>BATT_CPU_GOVERNOR</b>

       <b>BATT_CPU_IGNORE_NICE_LOAD</b>

       <b>LM_AC_CPU_MAXFREQ</b>

       <b>LM_AC_CPU_MINFREQ</b>

       <b>LM_AC_CPU_GOVERNOR</b>

       <b>LM_AC_CPU_IGNORE_NICE_LOAD</b>

       <b>NOLM_AC_CPU_MAXFREQ</b>

       <b>NOLM_AC_CPU_MINFREQ</b>

       <b>NOLM_AC_CPU_GOVERNOR</b>

       <b>NOLM_AC_CPU_IGNORE_NICE_LOAD</b>
                 These  options  specify  the  CPU  frequency  bounds  and scaling governor in the various power
                 states. You can change the <b>MAXFREQ</b> and <b>MINFREQ</b> values to any value listed in
                               <u>/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies</u>.
                 In addition, you can use "fastest" and "slowest". The GOVERNOR option controls the setting  for
                 <u>/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/scaling_governor</u>.  The  available  options are dependent on the
                 installed kernel. The most common ones are "conservative", "performance"  and  "ondemand".  The
                 <b>IGNORE_NICE_LOAD</b>  option  controls  a  setting  that  is  available  for the "conservative" and
                 "ondemand" governors. Set this option to 1 if you want the frequency scaling  governor  to  not
                 increase the CPU frequency for the sake of low-priority ("nice") background processes.

       <b>CONTROL_CPU_THROTTLING</b>
                 When  this  option  is  enabled, laptop mode tools controls your CPU's throttling level.  It is
                 only useful if your CPU doesn't support frequency scaling.  This option is  only  supported  on
                 some ACPI hardware.

       <b>BATT_CPU_THROTTLING</b>

       <b>LM_AC_CPU_THROTTLING</b>

       <b>NOLM_AC_CPU_THROTTLING</b>
                 These  options  specify  the throttling level for the CPU in the various power states.  You can
                 change it to any level listed in <u>/proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/throttling</u> (use only  the  number!).
                 In  addition,  you  can use "maximum" (which is the slowest option), "minimum" (full speed) and
                 "medium" (about halfway).

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/sched-smt-power-savings.conf</b></u>
       The sched-smt-power-savings module controls the behavior of the process  scheduler  on  SMT  boxes,  when
       running in battery mode.

       <b>CONTROL_SCHED_SMT_POWER_SAVINGS</b>
                 Set this to 1 to enable power savings in the process scheduler for SMT processors.

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/dpms-standby.conf</b></u>
       The dpms-standby module allows you to control the DPMS standby timeouts for X displays.

       <b>CONTROL_DPMS_STANDBY</b>
                 When  this  option  is  enabled,  laptop  mode  will control the DPMS standby timeout for all X
                 displays on the machine that users have logged on to.  In short, this  allows  laptop  mode  to
                 control the time after which your screen is blanked.

                 There  is  one  limitation to this feature: the settings are not automatically applied to new X
                 logons. This can be fixed by configuring the display manager.  For  the  gdm  display  manager,
                 configure  a PostLogin directory (usually <u>/etc/gdm/PostLogin</u> or <u>/etc/X11/gdm/PostLogin</u>), and in
                 that directory create a shell script called Default. In that file, include the command:

                      ( sleep 60 ; /usr/sbin/laptop_mode force ) &amp;

                      Similar configurations are possible for other window managers. Please consult your  window
                      manager documentation for more information.

                 The  <b>BRIGHTNESS_COMMAND</b>  settings  specify commands that should be executed in order to set the
                 brightness of your LCD. The <b>BRIGHTNESS_OUTPUT</b> setting specifies where the output of the command
                 will be written. For instance, if your LCD's brightness is adjusted by writing a numeric  value
                 3 to a file called <u>/proc/brightness</u>, you should set the command to "echo 3" and the output file
                 to "/proc/brightness". If your LCD's brightness is adjusted using a utility like "toshset", you
                 should  include  the  entire  toshset  command  line as the command, and set the output file to

       <b>CONTROL_VGASWITCHEROO</b>
                 When this option is enabled, laptop mode will use the vgaswitcheroo interface  to  disable  the

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/auto-hibernate.conf</b></u>
       The auto-hibernate module allows you to automatically hibernate  your  computer  when  the  battery  goes
       critical or when the battery level goes below a certain threshold.

       <b>ENABLE_AUTO_HIBERNATION</b>
                 When  this  option  is enabled, laptop mode will automatically hibernate your computer when the
                 battery level reaches a certain configurable threshold. This feature  is  only  available  when
                 ACPI is enabled.

       <b>HIBERNATE_COMMAND</b>
                 This  option  specifies  the  command  that laptop mode should execute when auto-hibernation is
                 triggered. Normally, this is set to something like "/usr/sbin/hibernate".

       <b>AUTO_HIBERNATION_BATTERY_CHARGE_PERCENT</b>
                 The battery level threshold for auto-hibernation, as  a  percentage  of  total  battery  design
                 capacity.

       <b>AUTO_HIBERNATION_ON_CRITICAL_BATTERY_LEVEL</b>
                 When  this  option is enabled, auto-hibernation will kick in when the battery reports its state
                 as "critical".

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/battery-level-polling.conf</b></u>
       Some battery hardware does not send out proper level change events, or  too  infrequent  ones.  For  such
       hardware,  laptop  mode tools will not detect that the battery has reached a critical level. The battery-
       level-polling module allows you to use the auto-hibernate module and the other  battery  level  dependent
       features of laptop mode tools even when your battery does not send out frequent ACPI to indicate a change
       in level.

       <b>CONTROL_BATTERY_LEVEL_POLLING</b>
                 When  this option is enabled, laptop mode tools will automatically poll the battery level every
                 once in a while to see if the levels have changed, and to see if actions should be taken  as  a
                 consequence.

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/start-stop-programs.conf</b></u>
       The  start-stop-programs  module  allows  you  to  start or stop programs when the computer switches to a
       different power state.

       <b>CONTROL_START_STOP</b>
                 If this option is enabled, laptop mode tools will automatically start and stop daemons or other
                 programs for you. The actual configuration of which daemons are to be stopped/started  is  done
                 by placing links to the daemons' init scripts in the following directories:

                    <u>/etc/laptop-mode/batt-start</u>

                    <u>/etc/laptop-mode/batt-stop</u>

                    <u>/etc/laptop-mode/lm-ac-start</u>

                    <u>/etc/laptop-mode/lm-ac-stop</u>

                    <u>/etc/laptop-mode/nolm-ac-start</u>

                    <u>/etc/laptop-mode/nolm-ac-stop</u>
                 As  you have probably guessed, the directories of the form "X-stop-daemons" should contain init
                 scripts of daemons that you want stopped in mode X, while the directories of the form "X-start-
                 daemons" should contain init scripts of daemons that you want started in mode X. Of course,  it
                 is  possible  to put in your own handling of modes as well: the only requirement on the scripts
                 in the directories is that they handle the "start"  and  "stop"  commands,  like  init  scripts
                 usually do.

                 The  ordering  of the script handling is as follows. When a mode is entered, the actions of the
                 previous mode are undone, in reverse order. This means that  if  the  previous  mode  had  done
                 "daemon1  stop",  "daemon2 stop" and "daemon3 start", then the undoing actions will be "daemon3
                 stop", "daemon2 start", "daemon1 start". After that, the stop-scripts  for  the  new  mode  are
                 called,  and  then  the  start-scripts  are  called.  Please note that there is no detection of
                 commonalities between modes at this point, i.e., if the mode you're coming from  and  the  mode
                 you're  going  to both specify that a daemon "X" should be stopped, then the daemon will be un-
                 stopped (that is, started) while leaving the previous mode, and then stopped again.

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/configuration-file-control.conf</b></u>
       The configuration-file-control module allows you to switch between different configuration files when the
       computer is in different power states.

       The  primary  use  for  this feature is for controlling the configuration files of syslog daemons. Syslog
       daemons have a tendency to sync their log files when entries are written to them. This  causes  disks  to
       spin  up, which is not very nice when you're trying to save power. The <u>syslog.conf</u> configuration file can
       be tweaked so that syslogd will <u>not</u> sync a given file, by prepending the log file name with a dash,  like
       this:

            mail.*      -/var/log/mail/mail.log

       <b>Note:</b>  This feature will NOT work if <b>CONTROL_SYSLOG_CONF</b> is set in laptop-mode.conf.  To start using this
       feature, remove the <b>CONTROL_SYSLOG_CONF</b> section in laptop-mode.conf, and then  restart  the  laptop-mode-
       tools  service.  The  new  config  files  have  different  names  than the old ones, and settings are NOT
       migrated. You will have to do this manually.

       <b>CONTROL_CONFIG_FILES</b>
                 If this option is enabled,  laptop  mode  tools  will  use  the  following  options  to  switch
                 configuration files depending on the power state.

       <b>CONFIG_FILES</b>
                 This  option  should  contain  a  space-separated  list  of  configuration files that should be
                 switched around depending on the power state.

                 For each configuration file, the specific configuration files will be named as follows:

                      <u>&lt;conffile&gt;-nolm-ac</u>

                      <u>&lt;conffile&gt;-lm-ac</u>

                      <u>&lt;conffile&gt;-batt</u>

                 The first file will be used when the system is on AC power and laptop mode is not  active.  The
                 second  file  will  be used when the system is on AC power and laptop mode is active. The third
                 file will be used when the system is on battery power.

                 When the laptop mode tools service is enabled, it will replace the configuration files  with  a
                 symlink  to  one  of the three state-based configuration files. The original configuration file
                 will be saved as &lt;config file&gt;.lmbackup, and it will be restored when  the  laptop  mode  tools
                 service is disabled.

                 When you add files to this list, make sure to also add the appropriate programs and services to
                 the configuration settings below.

                 You  can  create the alternate configuration files yourself. If you don't, they will be created
                 by laptop mode tools the next time it is restarted. To force the files to be created,  run  the
                 laptop-mode service init script with the "restart" parameter.

       <b>CONFIG_FILE_SIGNAL_PROGRAMS</b>
                 This  option  should  contain a space-separated list of programs that should be signalled after
                 the config files have been switched around. This only works for programs that  respond  to  the
                 SIGHUP signal by reloading their configuration files.

       <b>CONFIG_FILE_RELOAD_SERVICES</b>
                 This  option  should  contain a space-separated list of services which should be reloaded after
                 the config files have been switched around.

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/wireless-power.conf</b></u>
       The wireless-power module allows you to alter the power management settings for wireless network adapters
       that support the iwconfig "power" option. This module is not usable for Intel network adapters  that  use
       the iwlwifi or ipw drivers, they are supported by separate modules described below.

       <b>CONTROL_WIRELESS_POWER_SAVING</b>
                 If  this  option is enabled, laptop mode tools will set the wireless power saving mode settings
                 based on the power state.

       <b>WIRELESS_AC_POWER_SAVING</b>

       <b>WIRELESS_BATT_POWER_SAVING</b>
                 These settings define the power saving modes on AC and on battery. The allowed values are 0 (to

       3945, 2100 and 2200 wireless network adapters. This module is intended for use with the ipw3945, ipw2100,
       ipw2200 drivers, not with the iwlwifi drivers.

       <b>CONTROL_IPW_POWER</b>
                 If  this  option  is enabled, laptop mode tools will set the wireless power management settings
                 based on the power state.

       <b>IPW3945_AC_POWER</b>

       <b>IPW3945_BATT_POWER</b>
                 These settings define the power management levels for the ipw3945 driver. The  defaults  are  6
                 for AC, and 7 for battery mode. The allowed values are 1 (highest power) to 5 (lowest power), 6
                 (AC mode, full power) and 7 (battery mode, lowest power).

       <b>IPW2100_AC_POWER</b>

       <b>IPW2100_BATT_POWER</b>
                 These  settings  define  the power management levels for the ipw2100 driver. The defaults are 0
                 for AC mode and 5 for battery mode.

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/wireless-iwl-power.conf</b></u>
       The wireless-iwl-power module allows you to alter the power management settings  for  Intel  PRO/Wireless
       3945  and  Intel  WiFi  Link  4965  wireless  network adapters.  This module is intended for use with the
       iwlwifi drivers, not with the old ipw drivers.

       <b>CONTROL_IWL_POWER</b>
                 If this option is enabled, laptop mode tools will set the wireless  power  management  settings
                 based on the power state.

       <b>IWL_AC_POWER</b>

       <b>IWL_BATT_POWER</b>
                 These  settings define the power management levels on AC and on battery. The defaults are 0 for
                 AC, and 3 for battery mode. The allowed values are 0 (highest power) to 5 (lowest power), 6 (AC
                 mode, full power) and 7 (battery mode, lowest power).

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/exec-commands.conf</b></u>
       There can be many odd machines and many power savings settings, that laptop-mode-tools currently does not
       cover. If you run into a similar power saving problem, where you do not have a  laptop-mode-tools  module
       for it, you can use the exec-commands module to trigger the command during power state changes. Please do
       contribute back the power saving item as a module to the upstream developers.

       <b>CONTROL_EXEC_COMMANDS</b>
                 Set  this  to  0 to disable execution of custom commands during power state changes. Default is
                 auto.

       <b>BATT_EXEC_COMMAND_0=</b>

       <b>BATT_EXEC_COMMAND_1=</b>

       <b>LM_AC_EXEC_COMMAND_0=</b>

       <b>LM_AC_EXEC_COMMAND_1=</b>

       <b>NOLM_AC_EXEC_COMMAND_0=</b>

       <b>NOLM_AC_EXEC_COMMAND_1=</b>
                 Here you can specify your custom command that will need to be executed. The numbers can grow up
                 to 9. The command needs to be specified in double quotes

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/eee-superhe.conf</b></u>
       The eee-superhe module allows you to control the CPU frequency scalling on the EEE PC.  It  requires  the
       eeepc_laptop kernel module to be loaded.

       <b>CONTROL_SUPERHE</b>
                 It  this  option  is enabled, laptop mode tools will automatically control the FSB speed on the
                 EEE PC.

       <b>BATT_SUPERHE</b>

       <b>LM_AC_SUPERHE</b>

       <b>NOLM_AC_SUPERHE</b>
                 These settings define the power management levels on AC and on battery. The defaults are 0  for
                 LM_AC and NOLM_AC, and 2 for battery mode.

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/hal-polling.conf</b></u>
       The  hal-polling  module allows you to control the polling of CD/DVD drives by HAL. The polling is needed
       for some drives to detect inserted CDs, but it uses a considerable amount of power. Enable this module to
       disable the polling, but only if our drive doesn't need it, or if you are willing to mount  CDs  manually
       in exchange for the power saving.

       <b>CONTROL_HAL_POLLING</b>
                 If this option is enabled, laptop mode tools will control the HAL polling behaviour.

       <b>BATT_DISABLE_HAL_POLLING</b>

       <b>AC_DISABLE_HAL_POLLING</b>
                 These  settings  define the polling behaviour on AC and on battery. To disable polling, set the
                 options to 1, to enable, set them to 0.

       <b>HAL_POLLING_DEVICES</b>
                 This setting defines for which devices the  polling  behaviour  will  be  altered.   It  should
                 contain a space separated list of devices.

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/bluetooth.conf</b></u>
       The bluetooth module allows you to enable/disable bluetooth depending on the power state.

       <b>CONTROL_BLUETOOTH</b>
                 If this option is enabled, laptop mode tools will enable/disable bluetooth when the power state
                 changes.

       <b>BATT_ENABLE_BLUETOOTH</b>

       <b>AC_ENABLE_BLUETOOTH</b>
                 These  settings define whether bluetooth is enabled on AC and on battery. To disable bluetooth,
                 set the options to 0, to enable, set them to 1.

       <b>BLUETOOTH_INTERFACES</b>
                 This setting defines the interfaces the bluetooth module will  control.  It  should  contain  a
                 space  separated list of interfaces. (Note that you probably have only one bluetooth interface,
                 and it will probably be named "hci0".)

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/intel-sata-powermgmt.conf</b></u>
       The intel-sata-powermgmt module allows you to enable the power saving mode for Intel AHCI compliant  SATA
       controllers. This power saving mode is also known as Aggressive Link Power Management (ALPM).

       <b>CONTROL_INTEL_SATA_POWER</b>
                 If  this  option  is  enabled,  laptop  mode  tools  will  automatically  enable the Intel SATA
                 controller power saving settings. The power saving settings are always  enabled,  not  only  on
                 battery power.

       <b>BATT_ACTIVATE_SATA_POWER=1</b>

       <b>LM_AC_ACTIVATE_SATA_POWER=0</b>

       <b>NOLM_AC_ACTIVATE_SATA_POWER=0</b>
                 These settings control the behavior of the SATA devices under AC and battery power states

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/sched-mc-power-savings.conf</b></u>
       The  sched-mc-power-savings  module allows you to tune the Linux kernel process scheduler to optimize for
       power usage on multi-core and multi-processor computers.

       <b>CONTROL_SCHED_MC_POWER_SAVINGS</b>
                 If this option is enabled, laptop mode tools will automatically configure  the  kernel  process
                 scheduler  to  optimize  for  power  usage  on  multi-core  and  multi-processor computers. The
                 optimizations will only be enabled in battery mode.

   <u><b>/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/video-out.conf</b></u>
       The video-out module allows you to selectively disable video outputs depending on the power status.  This
       works only for video hardware that supports xrandr.

       <b>CONTROL_VIDEO_OUTPUTS</b>
                 If  this  option  is enabled, laptop mode tools will automatically disable the configured video
                 outputs.

       <b>BATT_DISABLE_VIDEO_OUTPUTS</b>

       <b>LM_AC_DISABLE_VIDEO_OUTPUTS</b>

       <b>NOLM_AC_DISABLE_VIDEO_OUTPUTS</b>
                 These settings define which video outputs are to be disabled in which power state.  The  format
                 is a space-separated list of outputs. The allowed names of the outputs depend on what the video
                 hardware supports, they can be found by running the "xrandr" command.
