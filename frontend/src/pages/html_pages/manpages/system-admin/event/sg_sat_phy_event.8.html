</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sg_sat_phy_event - use ATA READ LOG EXT via a SAT pass-through to fetch SATA phy event counters

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sg_sat_phy_event</b>  [<u>--ck_cond</u>]  [<u>--extend</u>]  [<u>--help</u>]  [<u>--hex</u>] [<u>--ignore</u>] [<u>--len=</u>{16|12}] [<u>--raw</u>] [<u>--reset</u>]
       [<u>--verbose</u>] [<u>--version</u>] <u>DEVICE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This utility sends an ATA READ LOG EXT with the log page ("address") set to 11h to <u>DEVICE</u> and outputs the
       response. Log page 11h is defined in the SATA 2.5 standard and contains phy event counters.  Rather  than
       send  this  command  directly  to the <u>DEVICE</u>, are sent via a SCSI transport which is assumed to contain a
       SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) Layer (SATL). The SATL may be in an operating system driver,  in  host  bus
       adapter firmware or in some external enclosure.

       The  SAT  standard  (SAT  ANSI INCITS 431-2007, prior draft: sat-r09.pdf at www.t10.org) defines two SCSI
       "ATA PASS-THROUGH" commands: one using a 16 byte "cdb" and the other with a 12  byte  cdb.  This  utility
       defaults  to  using the 16 byte cdb variant. SAT-2 is also a standard: SAT-2 ANSI INCITS 465-2010 and the
       draft prior to that is sat2r09.pdf . The  SAT-3  project  has  started  and  the  most  recent  draft  is
       sat3r01.pdf .

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--ck_cond</b>
              sets the CK_COND bit in the ATA PASS-THROUGH SCSI cdb. The default setting is clear (i.e. 0). When
              set  the  SATL  should  yield  a  sense  buffer containing a ATA Result descriptor irrespective of
              whether the command succeeded or failed. When clear the SATL should  only  yield  a  sense  buffer
              containing a ATA Result descriptor if the command failed.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--extend</b>
              sets  the EXTEND bit in the ATA PASS-THROUGH SCSI cdb. The default setting is clear (i.e. 0). When
              set a 48 bit LBA command is sent to the device. This option has no effect when <u>--len=12</u>.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              outputs the usage message summarizing command line options then exits. Ignores <u>DEVICE</u> if given.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b>
              outputs the ATA READ LOG EXT response in hex. The default action (i.e. without any  '-H'  options)
              is  to  output  the response in hex, grouped in 16 bit words (i.e. the ATA standard's preference).
              When given once, the response is output in ASCII hex bytes (i.e. the SCSI standard's  preference).
              When  given  twice  (i.e.  '-HH')  the  output is in hex, grouped in 16 bit words, the same as the
              default but without a header.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ignore</b>
              usually the phy counter identifier names are decoded. When this option is given, the numeric value
              of the identifier is output, the vendor flag, the data length (in  bytes)  and  the  corresponding
              value.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--len</b>={16|12}
              this  is  the  length  of  the  SCSI cdb used for the ATA PASS-THROUGH commands.  The argument can
              either be 16 or 12. The default is 16. The larger cdb size is needed for 48 bit LBA addressing  of
              ATA  devices.  On  the  other hand some SCSI transports cannot convey SCSI commands longer than 12
              bytes.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>
              output the ATA READ LOG EXT response in binary. The output should be piped to a  file  or  another
              utility when this option is used.  The binary is sent to stdout, and errors are sent to stderr.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--reset</b>
              reset the counters after the current values are returned, decoded and displayed.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increases the level or verbosity.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print out version string

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  SCSI  ATA PASS-THROUGH (12) command's opcode is 0xa1 and it clashes with the MMC set's BLANK command
       used by cd/dvd writers. So a SATL in front of an ATAPI device that uses MMC (i.e. has  peripheral  device
       type 5) probably should treat opcode 0xa1 as a BLANK command and send it through to the cd/dvd drive. The
       ATA PASS-THROUGH (16) command's opcode (0x85) does not clash with anything so it is a better choice.

       In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the <u>DEVICE</u> must be a SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block
       devices (e.g. disks and ATAPI DVDs) can also be specified. For example "sg_inq /dev/sda" will work in the
       2.6  series kernels. From lk 2.6.6 other SCSI "char" device names may be used as well (e.g. "/dev/st0m").
       Prior to lk 2.6.29 USB mass storage limited sense data to 18 bytes which made the <b>--ck_cond</b> option  yield
       strange (truncated) results.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_sat_identify is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.
