       omniEvents - CORBA Event Service daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>omniEvents</b> [-p <u>port</u>] [-a <u>endpoint</u>] [-l <u>directory</u>] [-P <u>pidfile</u>] [-N <u>factory-name</u>] [-f] [-t <u>file</u>] [-vVh]
                  [-ORB<u>parameter</u> <u>value</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>omniEvents</b>  is  a  CORBA  Event  Service  server program. It is designed to be run as a standalone daemon
       process.

       The server continuously saves its state to a file. Event channels are re-created from this file each time
       the server restarts. The options <b>-p</b> and <b>-a</b> affect the identity of the server's event channels,  so  these
       options can only be set the first time the server is run.

       Servers  may  be  configured to operate in pairs - if one fails then clients automatically switch over to
       the alternate.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-p</b> <b>port</b>
              Sets the TCP port on which a new server will listen. The default is 11169

              This value is stored in the new server's persistent state. There is no need to supply this  option
              when  a server is restarted, since the value is read from the file. If the option is supplied then
              it is simply compared with the stored value - if the two do not match then the program exits  with
              an error.

       <b>-a</b> <b>endpoint</b>
              Sets  an  alternate endPoint for a new server. All CORBA object references generated by the server
              include the alternate address. When clients cannot contact the  server,  they  automatically  fall
              back to trying the alternate address.

              This  option is exactly equivalent to the ORB parameter <b>endPointNoListen</b>, except that the value is
              saved in the server's persistency file, so that it is remembered whenever omniEvents is restarted.

              The format for a TCP endpoint is giop:tcp:HOST:PORT, for example: -a giop:tcp:secondary.host:11169

              This value is stored in the server's persistent state. There is no need to supply this option when
              a server is restarted, since the value is read from the file. If the option is supplied then it is
              simply compared with the stored value - if the two do not match then the program exits with an er‐
              ror.

       <b>-l</b> <b>directory</b>
              Full path to data directory,  where  omniEvents  stores  its  persistent  state.  The  default  is
              <u>/var/lib/omniEvents</u>

       <b>-P</b> <b>pidfile</b>
              Keep  track  of  the  currently  running  omniEvents  process  in pidfile, which should usually be
              <u>/var/run/omniEvents.pid</u>. If pidfile already exists, then the server refuses to start. The  default
              is to not write a PID file.

       <b>-N</b> <b>factory-name</b>
              Sets  the  CORBA  Name Service name for the EventChannelFactory CORBA object. Each time the server
              starts, it registers its channel factory object with factory-name in the Name Service.

              Format for name: [CONTEXT-ID[.CONTEXT-KIND]/]*OBJECT-ID[.OBJECT-KIND]

              Examples: foo, foo.bar, foo.bar/baz/qux, foo/bar/baz.qux.

              The default is EventChannelFactory

       <b>-f</b>     Run the server in the foreground (do not daemonize).

       <b>-t</b> <b>file</b>
              Send trace messages to file instead of syslog.

       <b>-v</b>     Output the CORBA IOR of the EventChannelFactory CORBA object when the server starts. This will  go
              either to syslog or to the current trace file.

       <b>-V</b>     Display version.

       <b>-h</b>     Display a short summary of command-line options.

       <b>-ORBparameter</b> <b>value</b>
              Standard omniORB options. see omniORB documentation for details. Do NOT use this option to set the
              endPoint  or alternateEndPoint. This option is commonly used to set the omniORB traceLevel, in or‐
              der to get more detailed output.

              Example: <b>-ORBtraceLevel</b> <b>5</b>

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>CHANNEL</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The omniEvents::EventChannelFactory object implements the  standard  CosLifeCycle::GenericFactory  inter‐
       face. An EventChannel object is created by a call to the create_object(key,the_criteria) operation.

       The  ``key'' parameter must be set to ``EventChannel''.``object interface''. The ``the_criteria'' parame‐
       ter is a sequence of various service parameters. Supported parameters are listed below.

       CyclePeriod_ns (long)
              Sets the cycle period of the channel (nanoseconds). This is the time that the channel waits before
              transferring messages from the incoming queue to the outgoing  queue.  While  messages  are  being
              transferred, incoming calls are queued. The default is 0.1 seconds.

       FilterId (string)
              Only  types  whose  RepositoryId  matches the parameter are permitted to pass through the channel.
              Other events are silently ignored.

       InsName (string)
              Sets the name by which the EventChannel is known in omniEvents' INSPOA. You can refer to the chan‐
              nel with a corbaloc string like this: corbaloc::HOST:11169/NAME

       MaxNumProxies (long)
              The maximum number of ProxyPullSuppliers per channel.

       MaxQueueLength (long)
              How many events are buffered by the ConsumerAdmin object. The discard policy is FIFO, meaning that
              the oldest events are discarded first in case of overflow.

       PullRetryPeriod_ms (long)
              Period (milliseconds) between polls when in Pull Supplier - Push Consumer mode.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       SIGTERM, SIGINT
              Shuts down the server.

       SIGUSR1
              You can change the traceLevel while the application is running. Send the server  SIGUSR1  to  bump
              its traceLevel up by 5. The traceLevel is wrapped at 45, so you can always get it back to where it
              started by repeatedly sending SIGUSR1.

              Example: <b>kill</b> <b>-USR1</b> <b>`cat</b> <b>/var/run/omniEvents.pid`</b>

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       OMNIEVENTS_LOGDIR
              Sets the directory where data files are kept by default. An alternative to the <b>-l</b> option.

       OMNIORB_CONFIG
              The location of the omniORB configuration file.
