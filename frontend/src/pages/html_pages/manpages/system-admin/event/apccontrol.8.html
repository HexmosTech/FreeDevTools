</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       apccontrol — <a href="../man8/apcupsd.8.html">apcupsd</a>(8) event handler script

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apccontrol</b> { &lt;event&gt; &lt;ups-name&gt; &lt;connected&gt; &lt;powered&gt; }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When  <u><a href="../man8/apcupsd.8.html">apcupsd</a></u>(8)  detects  anomalies  from  the  UPS  being monitored, it triggers an event which usually
       results in one or more calls to the <b>apccontrol</b> shell script.  Each event  causes  <b>apccontrol</b>  to  take  a
       particular  action.  These actions default to sane behaviour for all the events that apcupsd is likely to
       encounter. However, you can change the behaviour of every single action.

       When apcupsd detects an event, it calls the <b>apccontrol</b> script with the following four arguments:

       event       This is the event that occurred. Refer to the list of possible events below.

       ups-name    This is the name of the UPS as specified in the <u>/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</u> configuration  file
                   - not the name in the EEPROM of a smart UPS.

       connected   This  is  1  if  apcupsd  is connected to the UPS via a serial or USB port.  In the case of a
                   slave machine where apcupsd is not directly connected to the UPS, this value will be 0.

       powered     This is 1 if the computer on which apcupsd is running is powered by the UPS  and  0  if  not.
                   This is not currently implemented and always defaults to 0.

       Events   are   sent   to   the   system   log   and,   optionally,   to   the   temporary   events   file
       (<u>/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.events</u>), and they also generate a call to <b>apccontrol</b> which in turn  will  call  any
       scripts you have placed in the <u>/etc/apcupsd</u> directory.

   <b>LIST</b> <b>OF</b> <b>EVENTS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DEFAULT</b> <b>ACTIONS</b>
       annoyme      apcupsd  generates  this  event  when a shutdown is scheduled, and the time specified by the
                    ANNOYME configuration directive in the <u>/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</u> file has expired.

                    Default action -- sends "Power problems please logoff." to <u><a href="../man1/wall.1.html">wall</a></u>(1) and then exits.

       battattach   apcupsd generates this event when it detects that the UPS battery has been reconnected after
                    a battdetach event.

                    Default action: does nothing.

       battdetach   apcupsd generates this event when it detects that the UPS battery has been disconnected.

                    Default action: does nothing.

       changeme     apcupsd generates this event when it detects that the utility power is on, but  the  battery
                    is not functioning correctly. This is repeated every 9 hours.

                    Default  action  -- sends "Emergency! UPS batteries have failed Change them NOW" to wall and
                    then exits.

       commfailure  apcupsd generates this event each time it loses communication with the monitored  UPS.  This
                    event is not detected on simple signalling UPSes like the Back-UPS 650.

                    Default action -- sends "Communications with UPS lost." to wall and then exits.

       commok       apcupsd  generates  this  event after a commfailure event when communication with the UPS is
                    re-established.

                    Default action -- sends "Communications with UPS restored." to wall and then exits.

       doreboot     This event is deprecated and should not be used.

                    Default action -- sends "Beginning Reboot Sequence" to wall and then calls <u><a href="../man8/shutdown.8.html">shutdown</a></u>(8)  with
                    the "-r now" command line arguments to reboot the computer.

       doshutdown   apcupsd  generates  this  event  to shutdown the computer when the UPS is running on battery
                    power and one of the limits (time, run, load) is reached.

                    Default action -- sends "Beginning Shutdown Sequence" to wall  and  then  calls  <u><a href="../man8/shutdown.8.html">shutdown</a></u>(8)
                    with the command line arguments "-h now" to shutdown the computer.

       emergency    apcupsd  generates  this  event when the UPS is on battery power, the battery is low and the
                    utility power is on: a sure sign of battery failure!

                    Default action -- sends "Emergency  Shutdown.  Possible  UPS  battery  failure."   to  wall.
                    Immediately after this, apcupsd generates a doshutdown event to shutdown the system.

       failing      apcupsd  generates  this event when the UPS is running on batteries and the UPS sets the low
                    battery signal indicating that battery power is nearly exhausted. After this event,  apcupsd
                    will immediately generate a doshutdown event.

                    Default  action  --  sends  "UPS  battery power exhausted. Doing shutdown." to wall and then
                    exits.

       killpower    apcupsd does not normally generate this event. Instead, it  is  invoked  directly  from  the
                    system  halt  script  as  'apccontrol  killpower'  because  the  killpower event needs to be
                    performed as late in system shutdown as possible.

                    Default action -- sends "UPS now committed to shut down" to wall, waits for 10  seconds  and
                    then  issues  the  command "apcupsd --killpower" to put the UPS into hibernate mode and shut
                    off power to the connected equipment.  In the case of a smart UPS, the UPS  will  then  wait
                    for  the  expiry  of any configured shutdown time delay specified by the SLEEP configuration
                    directive.  In hibernate mode, the UPS will restore utility power to the connected equipment
                    subject to the values specified for the RETURNCHARGE and WAKEUP configuration directives.

       loadlimit    apcupsd generates this event when the battery discharge limit specified by the  BATTERYLEVEL
                    configuration directive has been reached.

                    Default  action  --  sends "UPS battery discharge limit reached. Doing shutdown" to wall and
                    then exits. After this event, apcupsd will immediately generate a doshutdown event.

       mainsback    apcupsd generates this event when the utility power returns  after  a  powerout  event.  The
                    doshutdown  event  may  or  may not have been generated depending on the parameters you have
                    defined and the length of the power outage. Attempting cancellation of  a  doshutdown  event
                    should never be tried as it is very unlikely to succeed and will almost certainly leave your
                    computer in an indeterminate state.

                    Default  action  -- if the file <u>/var/run/powerfail</u> exists, sends "Continuing with shutdown."
                    to wall and then exits. Otherwise, does nothing.

       onbattery    apcupsd generates this event if a power failure has been detected and the UPS  is  still  on
                    battery  power  at  the  expiry  of  the delay specified by the ONBATTERYDELAY configuration
                    directive.

                    Default action -- sends "Power failure. Running on UPS batteries." to wall and then exits.

       offbattery   apcupsd generates this event when the utility power returns if, and only if,  the  onbattery
                    event has been generated.

                    Default -- sends ""Power has returned..." to wall and then exits.

       powerout     apcupsd generates this event as soon as apcupsd detects that the UPS has switched to battery
                    power and it is not a self-test.

                    Default action -- does nothing.

       remotedown   apcupsd  generates  this event on a slave machine when it detects either (1) that the master
                    has shutdown, or (2) that an onbattery event has occurred and communication with the  master
                    has been lost.

                    Default  action:  sends  "Remote  Shutdown. Beginning Shutdown Sequence." to wall and exits.
                    Immediately after this, apcupsd generates a doshutdown event to shutdown the system.

       runlimit     apcupsd generates this event when the remaining  runtime  limit  specified  by  the  MINUTES
                    configuration directive expires while the UPS is on battery power as the result of a utility
                    power  outage.  The  remaining  runtime is internally calculated by the UPS and monitored by
                    apcuspd.

                    Default action -- sends "UPS battery runtime percent reached. Doing shutdown."  to wall  and
                    then exits. After this event, apcupsd will immediately generate a doshutdown event.

       timeout      apcupsd  generates this event when the time specified by the TIMEOUT configuration directive
                    expires while the UPS is on battery power as the result of  a  utility  power  outage.  This
                    configuration  directive  is  not normally used with smart UPSes which would instead rely on
                    the  more  reliable  remaining  runtime  (MINUTES)  or  the  battery  level   (BATTERYLEVEL)
                    configuration directives.

                    Default  action  --  send "UPS battery runtime limit exceeded. Doing shutdown."  to wall and
                    then exits. After this event, apcupsd will immediately generate a doshutdown event.

       startselftest apcupsd generates this event when it detects the start of a UPS self test.

                    Default action: does nothing.

       endselftest  apcupsd generates this event when it detects the end of a UPS self test.

                    Default action: does nothing.

   <b>CUSTOMISING</b> <b>EVENT</b> <b>ACTIONS</b>
       Do <u>not</u> modify <b>apccontrol</b> directly as it will be overwritten the next time you upgrade to a new release of
       apcupsd.

       The recommended way to customise an event action is simply to create an executable program or script file
       with the same name as the event and put that file in the <u>/etc/apcupsd</u> directory. Now, when  the  selected
       event occurs, <b>apccontrol</b> will execute your program or script.

       If  you want <b>apccontrol</b> to also execute its default action for the selected event, your program or script
       should exit with an exit status of 0 (zero).

       If you do <u>not</u> want <b>apccontrol</b> to also execute its default action for the selected event, your program  or
       script  must exit with an exit status of 99. Be aware that if you completely override the default action,
       you must ensure the proper shutdown of your computer if this is necessary.

       Some sample scripts (changeme, commfailure, commok, offbattery and onbattery) that email messages to root
       instead of broadcasting  messages  to  all  logged-in  users  may  be  found  in  <u>/etc/apcupsd</u>  after  an
       installation and also in the <u>platforms/etc</u> directory of the apcupsd source code.
