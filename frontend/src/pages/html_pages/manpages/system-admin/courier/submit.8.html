</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       submit - Submit a new message to the Courier mail server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>/usr/bin/submit</b> [-expn=<u>address</u>] [-vrfy=<u>address</u>] [-vhost=<u>address</u>] [-bcc] [-delay=<u>n</u>] [-rfc3848=<u>type</u>]
                       {module} {"<u>type</u>; <u>hostid</u>"}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>submit</b> program submits messages to the Courier mail server for processing. The <b>submit</b> program is not
       intended to be invoked by the end user. It is used by the Courier mail server input modules only. The
       <b>submit</b> program's global read and execute permissions are turned off, so that it can only be executed by a
       process that's a member of the courier group.  <b>submit</b> is installed in the /usr/lib/courier/courier
       directory.

       <b>submit</b> always takes two command line arguments after any options:

       module
           This argument identifies the module that's running the <b>submit</b> command. It must be one of the module
           names that the Courier mail server knows about, such as local, or esmtp. This argument determines
           address rewriting rules.

       "<u>type</u>; <u>hostid</u>"
           This single argument identifies the source of the message, and must be suitable for the Remote-MTA:
           header in delivery status notifications, as specified by RFC 1894. For messages that are received via
           ESMTP, this argument is typically "dns; helohost (hostname [ip.address])".

       The <b>submit</b> program takes the following options:

       -expn=<u>address</u>
           Do not accept a message, instead "expand" the given address. If the specified address matches a
           locally-defined alias, <b>submit</b> prints the addresses this address expands to. If the specified address
           does not match a locally-defined alias, the address is displayed by itself.

       -vrfy=<u>address</u>
           Do not accept a message, instead verify the given address.  <b>submit</b> prints a suitable message and sets
           the exit code to indicate whether the specified address is valid, or not. If the address matches a
           local alias, <b>submit</b> will indicate a valid address, and exit. If the address does not match a local
           alias, <b>submit</b> checks if this address is deliverable by any output protocol module. If so, <b>submit</b> will
           indicate a valid address, and exit. Otherwise, <b>submit</b> prints a "User unknown" error message, and
           exits.

       -bcc
           If no recipients are given, obtain the list of recipients from Bcc: headers only. Normally, if no
           recipients are specified, <b>submit</b> reads the list of recipients from the To:, Cc: and Bcc: headers
           (Bcc: headers are always removed). The -bcc option ignores To: and Cc: headers for this purpose. This
           option is ignored if an explicit recipient list is specified (see below).

       -delay=<u>n</u>
           Wait <u>n</u> seconds before delivering the message. If not specified, delivery begins after waiting the
           amount of time specified by the /etc/courier/submitdelay configuration time (default: 0 seconds --
           immediate delivery).

       -rfc3848=<u>text</u>
           Specify the RFC 3848 transmission type label to be included in the message's “Received:” header

       -vhost=<u>address</u>
           Append “.<u>address</u>” to names of all configuration files Courier reads while processing this message.

</pre><h4><b>RESPONSES</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>SUBMIT</b></h4><pre>
       All replies from <b>submit</b> follow the format of SMTP responses, as defined in RFC822.

       To summarize: the responses are one or more lines long. Every line in the response instead of the last
       one consists of a three-digit numerical code, a dash, then arbitrary text. The last line (or the only
       line of the response) starts with a three-digit numerical code, a single space, and arbitrary text. The
       first digit of the numerical code indicates whether the response indicates success, or failure. If the
       first digit is 5, the response indicates a permanent failure. If the first digit is 4, the response
       indicates a temporary failure (the message or the address should be resubmitted later). If the first
       digit is not 4 or 5, the response indicates success, or acceptance.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGE</b> <b>SUBMISSION</b></h4><pre>
       Unless either <b>-expn</b> or <b>-vrfy</b> option is specified, <b>submit</b> reads the message envelope and contents from
       standard input, as follows. All input and output to <b>submit</b> consists of newline-terminated (NOT carriage
       return/newline terminated) lines of text.

       <b>submit</b> reads the first line of text, which specifies the envelope sender address. The line is formatted
       as follows:

           address&lt;tab&gt;format&lt;tab&gt;envid

       &lt;tab&gt; is the ASCII tab character. The address may be an empty string, optionally followed by tab, then
       "format", another tab, then "envid".

       <u>format</u> is one or more chatacters that specify delivery status notification processing, and other message
       options. The 'F' character specifies that delivery status notifications should include the entire
       message, 'H' specifies just the headers of the message should be included. Absence of either 'F' or 'H'
       specifies no preference. "S{keyword}" specifies the optional SECURITY extension keyword for this message.
       The 'V' character in <u>format</u> sets the VERP extension flag for this message. The '8' character is a flag
       indicating that the message was received via SMTP with a SMTPUTF8 keyword, this prepends “UTF8” to the
       transmission type passed in via <b>-rfc3848</b>.

       <u>envid</u> is the original message envelope ID, that will be shown on any delivery status notifications. NOTE:
       <u>envid</u> must be specified using xtext encoding (see the relevant RFCs).

       After reading the first line of text, <b>submit</b> prints a response (see "RESPONSES FROM SUBMIT", above). If
       the response is a failure, <b>submit</b> terminates immediately. Otherwise, <b>submit</b> then reads one or more
       envelope recipients.

       Each envelope recipient is read as a single non-empty line of text, formatted as follows:

           address&lt;tab&gt;dsn&lt;tab&gt;oreceipient

       <u>address</u> is a non-empty recipient E-mail address, optionally followed by the tab character, then zero or
       more characters specifying <u>dsn</u>, then a tab character, then the <u>orecipient</u> value.

       <u>dsn</u> is zero or more of the following characters: S - send a delivery status notification upon a
       successful delivery to this address, F - send a DSN upon a failed delivery, D - send a DSN upon a mail
       delay, N - never send a DSN.  <u>oreceipient</u> is the "Original Recipient", as specified in RFC1894, except
       that is not encoded using xtext encoding, but in unencoded UTF-8.

       <b>submit</b> will print a response to each recipient (see "RESPONSES FROM SUBMIT", above). If at least one
       recipient address has been succesfully specified, a blank line is read to specify end of recipient list,
       which is followed by the entire message, headers and body.

       A single blank line terminates the list of recipients. That is followed by the message itself, until end
       of file.

       The blank line can be present before even a the first recipient is specified. If so, <b>submit</b> obtains the
       list of recipient from the message's headers.

       <b>submit</b> reads the message headers and body until end-of-file. Then, <b>submit</b> prints a response (see above),
       indicating whether or not the message was accepted for delivery, and terminates.

</pre><h4><b>ADDRESS</b> <b>REWRITING</b></h4><pre>
       Each recipient address (whether specified explicitly, or obtained from the message headers), will be
       rewritten according to the rewriting rules specified by the input module. Each address in the headers of
       the message will also be rewritten.

       After rewriting each recipient address, <b>submit</b> will search the aliases.dat file for this address, to see
       if it represents a locally defined alias. Submit searches
       /usr/lib/courier/courier/modules/<u>module</u>/aliases.dat and /etc/courier/aliases.dat (actual locations may be
       changed by the system administrator). If the address is found, the recipient address will be replaced by
       the addresses defined in the aliases.dat file.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>submit</b> also reads the following environment variables to further specify how the message is to be
       processed:

       BLOCK
           If this variable is set to a non-empty value, submit will reject every recipient (in effect,
           rejecting the message). The contents of the environment variable will be used as the error message.

       DSNENVID
           If envid is not specified, or is blank, and this environment variable is defined, the contents of
           this variable is used as the original envelope id field for DSNs. Note that DSNENVID is copied
           verbatim into the Original-Envelope-Id field (if the message is relayed to another MTA, the Courier
           mail server automatically xtext-encodes it).

       DSNNOTIFY
           If the dsn field for a recipient is empty, the contents of this environment variable is used in its
           place. Also, if the recipient list is read from the headers, the contents of this environment
           variable are used to set the dsn setting.

       DSNRET
           If the format field for this message is empty, the contents of this environment variable is used in
           its place.

       NOADDDATE
           Normally the Courier mail server adds a Date: header to the message, if it does not have one. If this
           environment variable is set, the Courier mail server will not add a Date: header.

       NOADDMSGID
           Normally the Courier mail server adds a Message-Id: header to the message, if it does not have it. If
           this environment variable is set, the Courier mail server will not add a Message-Id: header.

       NOADDRREWRITE
           Normally the Courier mail server rewrites addresses in the From:, To:, and Cc: header fields. If this
           environment variable is set to 1, the Courier mail server will not rewrite them. If it is set to a
           higher value, the Courier mail server will only rewrite it if no DKIM-Signature: header field was
           found.

       MIME
           Normally the Courier mail server adds any missing RFC2045 headers to the message. The <b>MIME</b>
           environment variable can be set to the following values: none - do not do any RFC2045 processing
           whatsoever; 7bit - if the message contains any 8-bit text, convert it to quoted-printable encoding;
           8bit -if the message contains any quoted-printable encoded text that can be representing as
           8bit-encoded text, then convert it to 8bit encoding.
