</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>fileserver</b> command initializes the File Server component of the "fs" process. In the conventional
       configuration, its binary file is located in the <u>/usr/lib/openafs</u> directory on a file server machine.

       The <b>fileserver</b> command is not normally issued at the command shell prompt, but rather placed into a
       database server machine's <u>/etc/openafs/BosConfig</u> file with the <b>bos</b> <b>create</b> command. If it is ever issued
       at the command shell prompt, the issuer must be logged onto a file server machine as the local superuser
       "root".

       The File Server creates the <u>/var/log/openafs/FileLog</u> log file as it initializes, if the file does not
       already exist. It does not write a detailed trace by default, but the <b>-d</b> option may be used to increase
       the amount of detail. Use the <b>bos</b> <b>getlog</b> command to display the contents of the log file.

       The command's arguments enable the administrator to control many aspects of the File Server's
       performance, as detailed in "OPTIONS".  By default the File Server sets values for many arguments that
       are suitable for a medium-sized file server machine. To set values suitable for a small or large file
       server machine, use the <b>-S</b> or <b>-L</b> flag respectively. The following list describes the parameters and
       corresponding argument for which the File Server sets default values, and the table below summarizes the
       setting for each of the three machine sizes.

       •   The maximum number of threads the File Server uses to handle requests for data; corresponds to the <b>-p</b>
           argument. The File Server always uses a minimum of 32 KB of memory for these processes.

       •   The  maximum  number  of  directory  blocks  the  File Server caches in memory; corresponds to the <b>-b</b>
           argument. Each cached directory block (buffer) consumes 2,092 bytes of memory.

       •   The maximum number of large vnodes the File Server caches in memory for tracking directory  elements;
           corresponds to the <b>-l</b> argument. Each large vnode consumes 292 bytes of memory.

       •   The  maximum  number  of  small  vnodes  the File Server caches in memory for tracking file elements;
           corresponds to the <b>-s</b> argument.  Each small vnode consumes 100 bytes of memory.

       •   The maximum volume cache size, which determines how many volumes the File Server can cache in  memory
           before having to retrieve data from disk; corresponds to the <b>-vc</b> argument.

       •   The  maximum  number  of callback structures the File Server caches in memory; corresponds to the <b>-cb</b>
           argument. Each callback structure consumes 16 bytes of memory.

       •   The maximum number of Rx packets the File Server uses;  corresponds  to  the  <b>-rxpck</b>  argument.  Each
           packet consumes 1544 bytes of memory.

       The default values are:

         Parameter (Argument)               Small (-S)     Medium   Large (-L)
         ---------------------------------------------------------------------
         Number of threads (-p)                     6           9          128
         Number of cached dir blocks (-b)          70          90          120
         Number of cached large vnodes (-l)       200         400          600
         Number of cached small vnodes (-s)       200         400          600
         Maximum volume cache size (-vc)          200         400          600
         Number of callbacks (-cb)             20,000      60,000       64,000
         Number of Rx packets (-rxpck)            100         150          200

       To  override  any  of the values, provide the indicated argument (which can be combined with the <b>-S</b> or <b>-L</b>
       flag).

       The amount of memory required for the File Server varies. The approximate default memory usage is 751  KB
       when the <b>-S</b> flag is used (small configuration), 1.1 MB when all defaults are used (medium configuration),
       and  1.4 MB when the <b>-L</b> flag is used (large configuration). If additional memory is available, increasing
       the value of the <b>-cb</b> and <b>-vc</b> arguments can improve File Server performance most directly.

       By default, the File Server allows a volume to exceed its quota by 1 MB when an  application  is  writing
       data  to  an existing file in a volume that is full. The File Server still does not allow users to create
       new files in a full volume. To change the default, use one of the following arguments:

       •   Set the <b>-spare</b> argument to the number of extra kilobytes that the File Server allows  as  overage.  A
           value of 0 allows no overage.

       •   Set the <b>-pctspare</b> argument to the percentage of the volume's quota the File Server allows as overage.

       By  default,  the  File  Server  implicitly  grants  the "a" (administer) and "l" (lookup) permissions to
       system:administrators on the access control list (ACL) of every directory in the volumes  stored  on  its
       file  server machine. In other words, the group's members can exercise those two permissions even when an
       entry for the group does not appear on an ACL.  To  change  the  set  of  default  permissions,  use  the
       <b>-implicit</b> argument.

       The  File  Server  maintains  a  <u>host</u> <u>current</u> <u>protection</u> <u>subgroup</u> (<u>host</u> <u>CPS</u>) for each client machine from
       which it has received a data access request. Like the CPS for a  user,  a  host  CPS  lists  all  of  the
       Protection  Database  groups to which the machine belongs, and the File Server compares the host CPS to a
       directory's ACL to determine in what manner users on the machine are authorized to access the directory's
       contents. When the <b>pts</b> <b>adduser</b> or <b>pts</b> <b>removeuser</b> command is used to change the groups to which a  machine
       belongs, the File Server must recompute the machine's host CPS in order to notice the change. By default,
       the  File  Server contacts the Protection Server every two hours to recompute host CPSs, implying that it
       can take that long for changed group memberships to become effective. To change this frequency,  use  the
       <b>-hr</b> argument.

       The  File  Server  stores  volumes  in partitions. A partition is a filesystem or directory on the server
       machine that is named "/vicepX" or "/vicepXX" where XX is "a" through "z" or "aa" though "iv". Up to  255
       partitions  are  allowed.  The  File Server expects that the /vicepXX directories are each on a dedicated
       filesystem. The File Server will only use a /vicepXX if it's a mountpoint for another filesystem,  unless
       the   file   "/vicepXX/AlwaysAttach"   exists.    A   partition   will   not   be  mounted  if  the  file
       "/vicepXX/NeverAttach" exists. If both "/vicepXX/AlwaysAttach" and  "/vicepXX/NeverAttach"  are  present,
       then "/vicepXX/AlwaysAttach" wins.  The data in the partition is a special format that can only be access
       using OpenAFS commands or an OpenAFS client.

       The File Server generates the following message when a partition is nearly full:

          No space left on device

       This  command does not use the syntax conventions of the AFS command suites. Provide the command name and
       all option names in full.

</pre><h4><b>CAUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are two strategies the File Server can use for attaching AFS volumes at startup and handling volume
       salvages.  The traditional method assumes all volumes are salvaged before  the  File  Server  starts  and
       attaches all volumes at start before serving files.  The newer demand-attach method attaches volumes only
       on  demand,  salvaging  them at that time as needed, and detaches volumes that are not in use.  A demand-
       attach File Server can also save state to disk for  faster  restarts.  The  <b>dafileserver</b>  implements  the
       demand-attach method, while <b>fileserver</b> uses the traditional method.

       The  choice  of  traditional  or  demand-attach File Server changes the required setup in <u>BosConfig</u>. When
       changing from a traditional File Server to demand-attach or vice versa, you will need to stop and  remove
       the "fs" or "dafs" node in <u>BosConfig</u> and create a new node of the appropriate type. See <b><a href="../man8/bos_create.8.html">bos_create</a></b>(8) for
       more information.

       Do  not  use  the <b>-w</b> argument, which is intended for use by the OpenAFS developers only. Changing it from
       its default values can result in unpredictable File Server behavior.

       Do not specify both the <b>-spare</b> and <b>-pctspare</b> arguments. Doing so causes the File Server to exit,  leaving
       an error message in the <u>/var/log/openafs/FileLog</u> file.

       Options  that  are  available  only on some system types, such as the <b>-m</b> and <b>-lock</b> options, appear in the
       output generated by the <b>-help</b> option only on the relevant system type.

       Currently, the maximum size of a volume quota is 2 terabytes (2^41 bytes)  and  the  maximum  size  of  a
       /vicepX  partition  on  a  fileserver is 2^64 kilobytes. The maximum partition size in releases 1.4.7 and
       earlier is 2 terabytes (2^31 bytes). The maximum partition size for 1.5.x releases 1.5.34 and earlier  is
       2 terabytes as well.

       The  maximum number of directory entries is 64,000 if all of the entries have names that are 15 octets or
       less in length. A name that is 15 octets long requires the use  of  only  one  block  in  the  directory.
       Additional  sequential  blocks  are  required to store entries with names that are longer than 15 octets.
       Each additional block provides an additional length of 32 octets for the name of the entry. Note that  if
       file names use an encoding like UTF-8, a single character may be encoded into multiple octets.

       In  real  world  use,  the  maximum  number  of objects in an AFS directory is usually between 16,000 and
       25,000, depending on the average name length.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-auditlog</b> &lt;<u>log</u> <u>path</u>&gt;
           Turns on audit logging, and sets the path for the audit log.  The audit log records information about
           RPC calls, including the name of the RPC call, the host that submitted the  call,  the  authenticated
           entity (user) that issued the call, the parameters for the call, and if the call succeeded or failed.

       <b>-audit-interface</b> (file | sysvmq)
           Specifies  what audit interface to use. The "file" interface writes audit messages to the file passed
           to <b>-auditlog</b>. The "sysvmq" interface writes audit messages to  a  SYSV  message  (see  <b><a href="../man2/msgget.2.html">msgget</a></b>(2)  and
           <b><a href="../man2/msgrcv.2.html">msgrcv</a></b>(2)).  The  message  queue  the "sysvmq" interface writes to has the key "ftok(path, 1)", where
           "path" is the path specified in the <b>-auditlog</b> option.

           Defaults to "file".

       <b>-d</b> &lt;<u>debug</u> <u>level</u>&gt;
           Sets the detail level for the debugging trace written to the <u>/var/log/openafs/FileLog</u>  file.  Provide
           one  of the following values, each of which produces an increasingly detailed trace: 0, 1, 5, 25, and
           125. The default value of 0 produces only a few messages.

       <b>-p</b> &lt;<u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>processes</u>&gt;
           Sets the number of threads to run. Provide a positive integer.  The File Server creates and uses five
           threads for special purposes, in addition to the number specified (but if this argument specifies the
           maximum possible number, the File  Server  automatically  uses  five  of  the  threads  for  its  own
           purposes).

           The  maximum  number  of  threads can differ in each release of OpenAFS.  Consult the <u>OpenAFS</u> <u>Release</u>
           <u>Notes</u> for the current release.

       <b>-spare</b> &lt;<u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>spare</u> <u>blocks</u>&gt;
           Specifies the number of additional kilobytes an application can store in a volume after the quota  is
           exceeded. Provide a positive integer; a value of 0 prevents the volume from ever exceeding its quota.
           Do not combine this argument with the <b>-pctspare</b> argument.

       <b>-pctspare</b> &lt;<u>percentage</u> <u>spare</u>&gt;
           Specifies the amount by which the File Server allows a volume to exceed its quota, as a percentage of
           the  quota. Provide an integer between 0 and 99. A value of 0 prevents the volume from ever exceeding
           its quota. Do not combine this argument with the <b>-spare</b> argument.

       <b>-b</b> &lt;<u>buffers</u>&gt;
           Sets the number of directory buffers. Provide a positive integer.

       <b>-l</b> &lt;<u>large</u> <u>vnodes</u>&gt;
           Sets the number of large vnodes available  in  memory  for  caching  directory  elements.  Provide  a
           positive integer.

       <b>-s</b> &lt;<u>small</u> <u>nodes</u>&gt;
           Sets  the  number  of  small vnodes available in memory for caching file elements. Provide a positive
           integer.

       <b>-vc</b> &lt;<u>volume</u> <u>cachesize</u>&gt;
           Sets the number of volumes the File Server can cache in memory.  Provide a positive integer.

       <b>-w</b> &lt;<u>call</u> <u>back</u> <u>wait</u> <u>interval</u>&gt;
           Sets the interval at which the daemon spawned by the File Server performs its maintenance  tasks.  Do
           not use this argument; changing the default value can cause unpredictable behavior.

       <b>-cb</b> &lt;<u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>callbacks</u>&gt;
           Sets the number of callbacks the File Server can track. Provide a positive integer.

       <b>-banner</b>
           Prints the following banner to <u>/dev/console</u> about every 10 minutes.

              File Server is running at I&lt;time&gt;.

       <b>-novbc</b>
           Prevents  the  File  Server from breaking the callbacks that Cache Managers hold on a volume that the
           File Server is reattaching after the volume was offline (as a result of the <b>vos</b> <b>restore</b> command,  for
           example). Use of this flag is strongly discouraged.

       <b>-nobusy</b>
           This  option  slightly  changes  the  error  codes  reported  to clients when an unattached volume is
           accessed by a client during fileserver startup.

           Normally, non-DAFS fileservers start accepting requests immediately on  startup,  but  attachment  of
           volumes can take a while. So if a client tries to access a volume that is not attached simply because
           the  fileserver  hasn't  attached  it  yet,  that  client  will get an error. With the <b>-nobusy</b> option
           present, the fileserver will immediately respond with an error code  that  indicates  the  server  is
           starting  up.  However, some older clients (before OpenAFS 1.0) don't understand this error code, and
           may not function optimally. So the default behavior, without the  <b>-nobusy</b>  option,  is  to  at  first
           respond with a different error code that is understood by more clients, but is indistinguishable from
           other scenarios where the volume is busy and not attached for other reasons.

           There is usually no reason to use this option under normal operation.

       <b>-implicit</b> &lt;<u>admin</u> <u>mode</u> <u>bits</u>&gt;
           Defines  the  set  of permissions granted by default to the system:administrators group on the ACL of
           every directory in a volume stored on the file server machine. Provide one or more  of  the  standard
           permission letters ("rlidwka") and auxiliary permission letters ("ABCDEFGH"), or one of the shorthand
           notations  for  groups  of permissions ("all", "none", "read", and "write"). To review the meaning of
           the permissions, see the <b>fs</b> <b>setacl</b> reference page.

       <b>-readonly</b>
           Don't allow writes to this fileserver.

       <b>-admin-write</b>
           Allows write requests for members of system:administrators on the read-only fileserver  in  question.
           The "-admin-write" option has no effect when the "-readonly" is not specified.

       <b>-hr</b> &lt;<u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>hours</u> <u>between</u> <u>refreshing</u> <u>the</u> <u>host</u> <u>cps</u>&gt;
           Specifies how often the File Server refreshes its knowledge of the machines that belong to protection
           groups (refreshes the host CPSs for machines). The File Server must update this information to enable
           users  from  machines recently added to protection groups to access data for which those machines now
           have the necessary ACL permissions.

       <b>-busyat</b> &lt;<u>redirect</u> <u>clients</u> <u>when</u> <u>queue</u> <u>&gt;</u> <u>n</u>&gt;
           Defines the number of incoming RPCs that can be waiting for a response from the  File  Server  before
           the  File  Server  returns  the  error code "VBUSY" to the Cache Manager that sent the latest RPC. In
           response, the  Cache  Manager  retransmits  the  RPC  after  a  delay.  This  argument  prevents  the
           accumulation  of  so  many  waiting  RPCs  that the File Server can never process them all. Provide a
           positive integer.  The default value is 600.

       <b>-rxpck</b> &lt;<u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>rx</u> <u>extra</u> <u>packets</u>&gt;
           Controls the number of Rx packets the File Server uses to store data for incoming  RPCs  that  it  is
           currently  handling,  that  are  waiting  for  a response, and for replies that are not yet complete.
           Provide a positive integer.

       <b>-rxdbg</b>
           Writes a trace of the File Server's operations on Rx packets to the file <u>/var/log/openafs/rx_dbg</u>.

       <b>-rxdbge</b>
           Writes a trace of the File Server's operations on Rx events (such as  retransmissions)  to  the  file
           <u>/var/log/openafs/rx_dbg</u>.

       <b>-rxmaxmtu</b> &lt;<u>bytes</u>&gt;
           Defines  the  maximum  size of an MTU.  The value must be between the minimum and maximum packet data
           sizes for Rx.

       <b>-jumbo</b>
           Allows the server to send and receive jumbograms. A jumbogram is a large-size packet composed of 2 to
           4 normal Rx data packets that share the same header.  The  fileserver  does  not  use  jumbograms  by
           default,  as some routers are not capable of properly breaking the jumbogram into smaller packets and
           reassembling them.

       <b>-nojumbo</b>
           Deprecated; jumbograms are disabled by default.

       <b>-rxbind</b>
           Force the fileserver to only bind to one IP address.

       <b>-allow-dotted-principals</b>
           By default, the RXKAD security layer will disallow access by Kerberos principals with a  dot  in  the
           first  component  of  their  name.  This  is  to  avoid the confusion where principals user/admin and
           user.admin are both mapped to the user.admin PTS entry. Sites whose Kerberos realms don't have  these
           collisions between principal names may disable this check by starting the server with this option.

       <b>-L</b>  Sets  values  for  many  arguments in a manner suitable for a large file server machine. Combine this
           flag with any option except the <b>-S</b> flag; omit both flags to set values suitable  for  a  medium-sized
           file server machine.

       <b>-S</b>  Sets  values  for  many  arguments in a manner suitable for a small file server machine. Combine this
           flag with any option except the <b>-L</b> flag; omit both flags to set values suitable  for  a  medium-sized
           file server machine.

       <b>-realm</b> &lt;<u>Kerberos</u> <u>realm</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           Defines the Kerberos realm name for the File Server to use. If this argument is not provided, it uses
           the realm name corresponding to the cell listed in the local <u>/etc/openafs/server/ThisCell</u> file.

       <b>-udpsize</b> &lt;<u>size</u> <u>of</u> <u>socket</u> <u>buffer</u> <u>in</u> <u>bytes</u>&gt;
           Sets  the  size  of the UDP buffer, which is 64 KB by default. Provide a positive integer, preferably
           larger than the default.

       <b>-sendsize</b> &lt;<u>size</u> <u>of</u> <u>send</u> <u>buffer</u> <u>in</u> <u>bytes</u>&gt;
           Sets the size of the send buffer, which is 16384 bytes by default.

       <b>-abortthreshold</b> &lt;<u>abort</u> <u>threshold</u>&gt;
           Sets the abort threshold, which is triggered when  an  AFS  client  sends  a  number  of  FetchStatus
           requests  in  a  row  and  all of them fail due to access control or some other error. When the abort
           threshold is reached, the file server starts to slow down the responses  to  the  problem  client  in
           order to reduce the load on the file server.

           The throttling behaviour can cause issues especially for some versions of the Windows OpenAFS client.
           When  using  Windows Explorer to navigate the AFS directory tree, directories with only "look" access
           for the current user may load more slowly because of the throttling.  This  is  because  the  Windows
           OpenAFS  client  sends  FetchStatus  calls  one  at  a time instead of in bulk like the Unix Open AFS
           client.

           Setting the threshold to 0 disables the throttling behavior. This  option  is  available  in  OpenAFS
           versions 1.4.1 and later.

       <b>-enable_peer_stats</b>
           Activates the collection of Rx statistics and allocates memory for their storage. For each connection
           with  a  specific  UDP  port  on  another  machine,  a  separate  record is kept for each type of RPC
           (FetchFile, GetStatus, and so on) sent or received. To display or otherwise access the  records,  use
           the Rx Monitoring API.

       <b>-enable_process_stats</b>
           Activates  the  collection of Rx statistics and allocates memory for their storage. A separate record
           is kept for each type of RPC (FetchFile, GetStatus, and so on) sent or received, aggregated over  all
           connections to other machines. To display or otherwise access the records, use the Rx Monitoring API.

       <b>-syslog</b> [&lt;loglevel&gt;]
           Use  syslog  instead  of  the  normal  logging location for the fileserver process.  If provided, log
           messages are at &lt;loglevel&gt; instead of the default LOG_USER.

       <b>-mrafslogs</b>
           Use MR-AFS (Multi-Resident) style logging.  This option is deprecated.

       <b>-transarc-logs</b>
           Use Transarc style logging  features.  Rename  the  existing  log  file  <u>/var/log/openafs/FileLog</u>  to
           <u>/var/log/openafs/FileLog.old</u>  when  the  fileserver  is  restarted.   This  option  is  provided  for
           compatibility with older versions.

       <b>-saneacls</b>
           Offer the SANEACLS capability for the fileserver.  This option is currently unimplemented.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

       <b>-vhandle-setaside</b> &lt;<u>fds</u> <u>reserved</u> <u>for</u> <u>non-cache</u> <u>io</u>&gt;
           Number of file handles set aside for I/O not in the cache. Defaults to 128.

       <b>-vhandle-max-cachesize</b> &lt;<u>max</u> <u>open</u> <u>files</u>&gt;
           Maximum number of available file handles.

       <b>-vhandle-initial-cachesize</b> &lt;<u>initial</u> <u>open</u> <u>file</u> <u>cache</u>&gt;
           Number of file handles set aside for I/O in the cache. Defaults to 128.

       <b>-vattachpar</b> &lt;<u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>volume</u> <u>attach</u> <u>threads</u>&gt;
           The number of threads assigned to attach and detach volumes.  The default is 1.  Warning: many of the
           I/O parallelism features of Demand-Attach Fileserver are turned off when the number of volume  attach
           threads is only 1.

           This option is only meaningful for a file server built with pthreads support.

       <b>-m</b> &lt;<u>min</u> <u>percentage</u> <u>spare</u> <u>in</u> <u>partition</u>&gt;
           Specifies the percentage of each AFS server partition that the AIX version of the File Server creates
           as  a  reserve. Specify an integer value between 0 and 30; the default is 8%. A value of 0 means that
           the partition can become completely full, which can have serious negative consequences.  This  option
           is not supported on platforms other than AIX.

       <b>-lock</b>
           Prevents  any  portion  of  the  fileserver binary from being paged (swapped) out of memory on a file
           server machine running the IRIX operating system.  This option is not supported  on  platforms  other
           than IRIX.

       <b>-offline-timeout</b> &lt;<u>timeout</u> <u>in</u> <u>seconds</u>&gt;
           Setting  this option to <u>N</u> means that if any clients are reading from a volume when we want to offline
           that volume (for example, as part of releasing a volume), we will wait <u>N</u>  seconds  for  the  clients'
           request  to  finish.  If  the  clients' requests have not finished, we will then interrupt the client
           requests and send an error to those clients, allowing the volume to go offline.

           If a client is interrupted, from the client's point of view, it will appear as if they  had  accessed
           the  volume after it had gone offline. For RO volumes, this mean the client should fail-over to other
           valid RO sites for that volume. This option may  speed  up  volume  releases  if  volumes  are  being
           accessed by clients that have slow or unreliable network connections.

           Setting this option to 0 means to interrupt clients immediately if a volume is waiting to go offline.
           Setting  this  option to -1 means to wait forever for client requests to finish. The default value is
           -1.

       <b>-offline-shutdown-timeout</b> &lt;<u>timeout</u> <u>in</u> <u>seconds</u>&gt;
           This option behaves similarly to <b>-offline-timeout</b> but applies to volumes that are  going  offline  as
           part  of  the fileserver shutdown process. If the value specified is <u>N</u>, we will interrupt any clients
           reading from volumes after <u>N</u> seconds have passed since we first  needed  to  wait  for  a  volume  to
           offline during the shutdown process.

           Setting  this  option to 0 means to interrupt all clients reading from volumes immediately during the
           shutdown process. Setting this option to -1 means to wait  forever  for  client  requests  to  finish
           during the shutdown process.

           If  <b>-offline-timeout</b>  is  specified,  the  default  value  of  <b>-offline-shutdown-timeout</b> is the value
           specified for <b>-offline-timeout</b>. Otherwise, the default value is -1.

       <b>-sync</b> &lt;always | onclose | none&gt;
           This option changes how hard the fileserver tries to ensure that data  written  to  volumes  actually
           hits the physical disk.

           Normally, when the fileserver writes to disk, the underlying filesystem or Operating System may delay
           writes  from  actually  going  to  disk,  and  reorder which writes hit the disk first. So, during an
           unclean shutdown of the machine (if the power goes out, or the machine crashes, etc), file  data  may
           become lost that the server previously told clients was already successfully written.

           To try to mitigate this, the fileserver will try to "sync" file data to the physical disk at numerous
           points  during  various I/O. However, this can result in significantly reduced performance. Depending
           on the usage patterns, this may or may not be acceptable. This option dictates specifically what  the
           fileserver does when it wants to perform a "sync".

           There are several options; pass one of these as the argument to -sync. The default is "onclose".

           always
               This  causes  a sync operation to always sync immediately and synchronously.  This is the slowest
               option that provides the greatest protection against data loss in the event of a crash.

               Note that this is still not a 100% guarantee that data will not be lost  or  corrupted  during  a
               crash. The underlying filesystem itself may cause data to be lost or corrupt in such a situation.
               And  OpenAFS  itself  does  not  (yet) even guarantee that all data is consistent at any point in
               time; so even if the filesystem and OS  do  not  buffer  or  reorder  any  writes,  you  are  not
               guaranteed that all data will be okay after a crash.

               This was the only behavior allowed in OpenAFS releases prior to 1.4.5.

           onclose
               This  causes  a  sync  to  do  nothing immediately, but causes the relevant file to be flagged as
               potentially needing a sync. When a volume is detached, volume metadata files  flaged  for  synced
               are synced, as well as data files that have been accessed recently. Events that cause a volume to
               detach include: performing volume operations (dump, restore, clone, etc), a clean shutdown of the
               fileserver, or during DAFS "soft detachment".

               Effectively  this  option  is  the  same as "never" while a volume is attached and actively being
               used, but if a volume is detached, there is an additional guarantee for the data's consistency.

               After the removal of the "delayed" option after the OpenAFS 1.6 series, this  option  became  the
               default.

           never
               This  causes  all  syncs  to  never  do  anything.  This  is the fastest option, with the weakest
               guarantees for data consistency.

               Depending on the underlying filesystem and Operating System, there may  be  guarantees  that  any
               data  written  to  disk  will hit the physical media after a certain amount of time. For example,
               Linux's pdflush process  usually  makes  this  guarantee,  and  ext3  can  make  certain  various
               consistency  guarantees  according  to the options given. ZFS on Solaris can also provide similar
               guarantees, as can various other platforms and filesystems. Consult the  documentation  for  your
               platform if you are unsure.

           delayed
               This  option  used  to exist in OpenAFS 1.6, but was later removed due to issues encountered with
               data corruption during normal operation. Outside of the OpenAFS 1.6 series, it  is  not  a  valid
               option,  and the fileserver will fail to start if you specify this (or any other unknown option).
               It caused syncs to occur in a background thread, executing every 10 seconds.

               This was the only behavior allowed in OpenAFS releases starting from 1.4.5 up  to  and  including
               1.6.2. It was also the default for the 1.6 series starting in OpenAFS 1.6.3.

           Which  option  you  choose  is not an easy decision to make. Various developers and experts sometimes
           disagree on which option is the most reasonable, and it may  depend  on  the  specific  scenario  and
           workload  involved.  Some  argue  that  the  "always"  option  does not provide significantly greater
           guarantees over any other option, whereas others argue that choosing anything  besides  the  "always"
           option  allows  for  an  unacceptable risk of data loss. This may depend on your usage patterns, your
           platform and filesystem, and who you talk to about this topic.

       <b>-logfile</b> &lt;<u>log</u> <u>file</u>&gt;
           Sets the file to use for server logging.  If logfile is not specified and no  other  logging  options
           are supplied, this will be <u>/var/log/openafs/FileLog</u>.  Note that this option is intended for debugging
           and  testing  purposes.   Changing  the  location of the log file from the command line may result in
           undesirable interactions with tools such as <b>bos</b>.

       <b>-vhashsize</b> <b>&lt;</b><u><b>size</b></u>
           The <b><a href="../man2/log.2.html">log</a></b>(2) of the number of volume hash buckets.  Default is 8 (i.e., by default, there are 2^8 = 256
           volume hash buckets). The minimum that can be specified is 6 (64 hash buckets). In OpenAFS 1.5.77 and
           earlier, the maximum that can be specified is 14 (16384 buckets). After 1.5.77, the maximum that  can
           be specified is 28 (268435456 buckets).

       <b>-config</b> &lt;<u>configuration</u> <u>directory</u>&gt;
           Set  the  location  of  the  configuration  directory  used  to configure this service.  In a typical
           configuration this  will  be  <u>/etc/openafs/server</u>  -  this  option  allows  the  use  of  alternative
           configuration locations for testing purposes.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  <b>bos</b>  <b>create</b>  command  creates  a  traditional  fs  process  on  the  file  server machine
       "fs2.example.com" that uses the large configuration size, and allows volumes to  exceed  their  quota  by
       10%. Type the command on a single line:

          % bos create -server fs2.example.com -instance fs -type fs \
                       -cmd "/usr/lib/openafs/fileserver -pctspare 10 -L" \
                       /usr/lib/openafs/volserver /usr/lib/openafs/salvager

</pre><h4><b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       Sending process signals to the File Server Process can change its behavior in the following ways:

         Process          Signal       OS     Result
         ---------------------------------------------------------------------

         File Server      XCPU        Unix    Prints a list of client IP

         Any server       TSTP        Any     Increases Debug level by a power
                                              of 5 -- 1,5,25,125, etc.
                                              This has the same effect as the
                                              -d XXX command-line option.

         Any Server       HUP         Any     Resets Debug level to 0

         File Server      TERM        Any     Run minor instrumentation over
                                              the list of descriptors.

         Other Servers    TERM        Any     Causes the process to quit.

         File Server      QUIT        Any     Causes the File Server to Quit.
                                              Bos Server knows this.

       The  basic  metric of whether an AFS file server is doing well is the number of connections waiting for a
       thread, which can be found by running the following command:

          % rxdebug &lt;server&gt; | grep waiting_for | wc -l

       Each line returned by "rxdebug" that contains the  text  "waiting_for"  represents  a  connection  that's
       waiting for a file server thread.

       If  the  blocked connection count is ever above 0, the server is having problems replying to clients in a
       timely fashion.  If it gets above 10, roughly, there will be noticeable slowness by the user.  The  total
       number  of  connections  is a mostly irrelevant number that goes essentially monotonically for as long as
       the server has been running and then goes back down to zero when it's restarted.

       The most common cause of blocked connections rising on a server is some process somewhere  performing  an
       abnormal  number  of  accesses  to  that  server  and  its  volumes.   If multiple servers have a blocked
       connection count, the most likely explanation is that there is a volume replicated between those  servers
       that is absorbing an abnormally high access rate.

       To get an access count on all the volumes on a server, run:

          % vos listvol &lt;server&gt; -long

       and  save the output in a file.  The results will look like a bunch of <b>vos</b> <b>examine</b> output for each volume
       on the server.  Look for lines like:

          40065 accesses in the past day (i.e., vnode references)

       and look for volumes with an abnormally high number of accesses.  Anything over 10,000  is  fairly  high,
       but  some volumes like root.cell and other volumes close to the root of the cell will have that many hits
       routinely.  Anything over 100,000 is generally abnormally high.  The count resets about once a day.

       Another approach that can be used to narrow the possibilities for  a  replicated  volume,  when  multiple
       servers are having trouble, is to find all replicated volumes for that server.  Run:

          % vos listvldb -server &lt;server&gt;

       where &lt;server&gt; is one of the servers having problems to refresh the VLDB cache, and then run:

          % vos listvldb -server &lt;server&gt; -part &lt;partition&gt;

       to get a list of all volumes on that server and partition, including every other server with replicas.

       Once the volume causing the problem has been identified, the best way to deal with the problem is to move
       that  volume  to  another  server with a low load or to stop any runaway programs that are accessing that
       volume unnecessarily.  Often the volume will be enough information to tell what's going on.

       If you still need additional information about who's hitting that server, sometimes you can guess at that
       information from the failed callbacks in the <u>FileLog</u> log in <u>/var/log/afs</u>  on  the  server,  or  from  the
       output of:

          % /usr/afsws/etc/rxdebug &lt;server&gt; -rxstats

       but  the best way is to turn on debugging output from the file server.  (Warning: This generates a lot of
       output into FileLog on the AFS server.)  To do this, log on to the  AFS  server,  find  the  PID  of  the
       fileserver process, and do:

           kill -TSTP &lt;pid&gt;

       where  &lt;pid&gt;  is  the PID of the file server process.  This will raise the debugging level so that you'll
       start seeing what people are actually doing on the server.  You can do this up to three more times to get
       even more output if needed.  To reset the debugging level back to normal, use (The following command will
       NOT terminate the file server):

       The debugging setting on the File Server should be reset back to  normal  when  debugging  is  no  longer
       needed.  Otherwise, the AFS server may well fill its disks with debugging output.

       The lines of the debugging output that are most useful for debugging load problems are:

           SAFS_FetchStatus,  Fid = 2003828163.77154.82248, Host 171.64.15.76
           SRXAFS_FetchData, Fid = 2003828163.77154.82248

       (The example above is partly truncated to highlight the interesting information).  The Fid identifies the
       volume and inode within the volume; the volume is the first long number.  So, for example, this was:

          % vos examine 2003828163
          pubsw.matlab61                   2003828163 RW    1040060 K  On-line
              afssvr5.Stanford.EDU /vicepa
              RWrite 2003828163 ROnly 2003828164 Backup 2003828165

              Creation    Mon Aug  6 16:40:55 2001
              Last Update Tue Jul 30 19:00:25 2002
              86181 accesses in the past day (i.e., vnode references)

              RWrite: 2003828163    ROnly: 2003828164    Backup: 2003828165
              number of sites -&gt; 3
                 server afssvr5.Stanford.EDU partition /vicepa RW Site
                 server afssvr11.Stanford.EDU partition /vicepd RO Site
                 server afssvr5.Stanford.EDU partition /vicepa RO Site

       and from the Host information one can tell what system is accessing that volume.

       Note  that  the  output  of  <b><a href="../man1/vos_examine.1.html">vos_examine</a></b>(1)  also includes the access count, so once the problem has been
       identified, vos examine can be used to see if the access count is still increasing.  Also  remember  that
       you can run vos examine on the read-only replica (e.g., pubsw.matlab61.readonly) to see the access counts
       on the read-only replica on all of the servers that it's located on.
