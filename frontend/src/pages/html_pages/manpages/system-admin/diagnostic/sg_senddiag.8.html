       <b>sg_senddiag</b>  [<u>-doff</u>] [<u>-e</u>] [<u>-h</u>] [<u>-H</u>] [<u>-l</u>] [<u>-pf</u>] [<u>-raw=H,H...</u>] [<u>-raw=-</u>] [<u>-s=ST</u>] [<u>-t</u>] [<u>-T=SECS</u>] [<u>-uoff</u>] [<u>-v</u>]
       [<u>-V</u>] [<u>-?</u>]  <u>DEVICE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This utility sends a SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command to the <u>DEVICE</u>. It can issue self-tests, find  supported
       diagnostic pages or send arbitrary diagnostic pages.

       When  the  <u>--list</u>  option and a <u>DEVICE</u> are given then the utility sends a SCSI RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS
       command to fetch the response (i.e.  the page numbers of supported diagnostic pages).

       When the <u>--list</u> option is given without a <u>DEVICE</u> then a list of diagnostic page names and their  numbers,
       known by this utility, are listed.

       This  utility  supports  two command line syntax-es, the preferred one is shown first in the synopsis and
       explained in this section. A later section on the old command line syntax outlines the  second  group  of
       options.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--doff</b>
              set  the  Device  Offline (DevOffL) bit (default is clear). Only significant when <u>--test</u> option is
              set for the default self-test. When set other operations on any logical units  controlled  by  the
              this device server (target) may be affected (delayed) while a default self-test is underway.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--extdur</b>
              outputs the expected extended self-test duration. The duration is given in seconds (and minutes in
              parentheses). This figure is obtained from mode page 0xa (i.e. the control mode page).

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              print usage message then exit.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b>
              outputs response from RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS in hex rather than decode it.  Only the Supported
              Diagnostic  Pages  diagnostic  page (i.e. page_code=0) is decoded; other pages (e.g. those used by
              SES) are output in hex.
              If <u>--hex</u> is used once, the hex output has a relative address at the start of each line.  If  <u>--hex</u>
              is  used  twice, then ASCII is shown to the right of each line of hex. If <u>--hex</u> is used three time
              or more, only the hex is output, in two character pairs (i.e. a byte) space separated and up to 16
              bytes per line. This latter form, if placed in a file or piped through to another  invocation,  is
              suitable for the <u>--raw=-</u> option.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
              when  a <u>DEVICE</u> is also given lists the names of all diagnostic pages supported by this device. The
              request is sent via a SEND DIAGNOSTIC command (with the "pF" bit set) and the response is  fetched
              by a RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command. When used in the absence of a <u>--list</u> argument then a list
              of diagnostic page names and their numbers, known by this utility, are listed.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--maxlen</b>=<u>LEN</u>
              where  <u>LEN</u>  is the value placed in the parameter list length field of a SEND DIAGNOSTIC command or
              in the allocation length field of a RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command. This only occurs when  the
              other  options imply there will be data sent or received by the command. The default value is 4096
              bytes. <u>LEN</u> cannot exceed 65535 or 0xffff in hexadecimal.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--old</b>
              Switch to older style options. Please use as first option.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--page</b>=<u>PG</u>
              where <u>PG</u> is the RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command page code field.  If this option is  given  the
              PCV  bit in that command is set. When this option is given then no SEND DIAGNOSTIC command is sent
              (unlike <u>--list</u>).  If <u>PG</u> is 0 then the response is decoded as if it is the SPC Supported Diagnostic
              pages diagnostic page. Other <u>PG</u> values (i.e. 1 to 255) have their responses output in hex.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pf</b>
              set Page Format (PF) bit. By default it is clear (i.e. 0) unless the list <u>--list</u> option  is  given
              in which case the Page Format bit is set (as required by SPC-3).

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>=<u>H,H...</u>
              string  of  comma separated hex numbers each of which should resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0 to ff
              inclusive). A (single) space separated string of hex bytes is also allowed but the list  needs  to
              be  in  quotes.  This  sequence  forms  a diagnostic page to be sent with the SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC
              command. Mostly likely the <u>--pf</u> option should also be given.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw=-</b>
              reads sequence of bytes from stdin. The sequence may be comma, space, tab  or  linefeed  (newline)
              separated.  If  a  line  contains  "#"  then  the  remaining  characters on that line are ignored.
              Otherwise each non separator character should resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0  to  ff  inclusive).
              This  sequence  forms  a  diagnostic page to be sent with the SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command. Mostly
              likely the <u>--pf</u> option should also be given.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--selftest</b>=<u>ST</u>
              where <u>ST</u> is the self-test code. The default value is 0 which is inactive. Some other values:
                <b>1</b> : background short self-test
                <b>2</b> : background extended self-test
                <b>4</b> : aborts a (background) self-test that is in progress
                <b>5</b> : foreground short self-test
                <b>6</b> : foreground extended self-test

       This option is mutually exclusive with default self-test (i.e.  can't have (<u>ST</u> &gt; 0) and <u>--test</u>).

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--test</b>
              sets the _default_ Self Test (SelfTest) bit. By default this  is  clear  (0).   The  <u>--selftest=ST</u>
              option  should  not be active together with this option. Both the <u>--doff</u> and/or <u>--uoff</u> options can
              be used with this option.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--timeout</b>=<u>SECS</u>
              where <u>SECS</u> is a timeout value (in seconds) for foreground self-test operations. The default  value
              is 7200 seconds (2 hours) and any values of <u>SECS</u> less than the default are ignored.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--uoff</b>
              set the Unit Offline (UnitOffL) bit (default is clear). Only significant when <u>--test</u> option is set
              for  the  default  self-test.  When  set  other  operations  on  this logical unit may be affected
              (delayed) while a default self-test is underway. Some devices (e.g. Fujitsu disks) do  more  tests
              when this bit is set.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase level of verbosity. Can be used multiple times.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print out version string then exit.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       All  devices  should  support  the  default  self-test.  The 'short' self-test codes should complete in 2
       minutes or less. The 'extended' self-test codes' maximum duration is vendor specific (e.g. a little  over
       10  minutes  with the author's disks). The foreground self-test codes wait until they are completed while
       the background self-test codes  return  immediately.  The  results  of  both  foreground  and  background
       self-test codes are placed in the 'self-test results' log page (see <a href="../man8/sg_logs.8.html">sg_logs</a>(8)). The SCSI command timeout
       for this utility is set to 60 minutes to allow for slow foreground extended self-tests.

       If  the <u>DEVICE</u> is a disk then no file systems residing on that disk should be mounted during a foreground
       self-test. The reason is that other SCSI commands may become queued behind the foreground  self-test  and
       timeout.

       When  the  <u>--raw=H,H...</u>  option  is  given then self-tests should not be selected. However the <b>--pf</b> (i.e.
       "page format") option should be given. The length of the diagnostic page to be sent is derived  from  the
       number  of  bytes given to the <u>--raw=H,H...</u> option. The diagnostic page code (number) should be the first
       byte of the sequence (i.e. as dictated by SPC-3 diagnostic page format). See the EXAMPLES section below.

       Arbitrary diagnostic pages can be read (in hex) with the <a href="../man8/sg_ses.8.html">sg_ses</a>(8) utility (not  only  those  defined  in
       SES-2).

       If  the  utility  is  used  with  no  options  (e.g.  "sg_senddiag /dev/sg1") Then a degenerate SCSI SEND
       DIAGNOSTIC command is sent with zero in all its fields apart from the opcode. Some devices report this as
       an error while others ignore it. It is not entirely clear from SPC-3 if it is  invalid  to  send  such  a
       command.

       In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the <u>DEVICE</u> must be a SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block
       devices (e.g. SCSI disks and DVD drives) can also be specified.

       To  access  SCSI  enclosures  see the <a href="../man8/sg_ses.8.html">sg_ses</a>(8) utility. sg_ses uses the SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC and RECEIVE
       DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS commands as outlined in the SES-2 (draft) standard.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_senddiag is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

</pre><h4><b>OLDER</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options in this section were the only ones available prior to sg3_utils version  1.23  .  Since  then
       this utility defaults to the newer command line options which can be overridden by using <u>--old</u> (or <u>-O</u>) as
       the  first  option. See the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section for another way to force the use of these older
       command line options.

       <b>-doff</b>  set the Device Offline (DevOffL) bit (default is clear). Only significant when <u>-t</u>  option  is  set
              for the default self-test. Equivalent to <u>--doff</u> in the main description.

       <b>-e</b>     outputs the expected extended self-test duration. Equivalent to <u>--extdur</u> in the main description.

       <b>-h</b>     outputs response from RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS in hex rather than decode it.

       <b>-H</b>     outputs response from RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS in hex rather than decode it.

       <b>-l</b>     when  a <u>DEVICE</u> is also given lists the names of all diagnostic pages supported by this device. The
              request is sent via a SEND DIAGNOSTIC command (with the "pf" bit set) and the response is  fetched
              by a RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command. When used in the absence of a <u>DEVICE</u> argument then a list
              of diagnostic page names and their numbers, known by this utility, are listed.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--new</b>
              Switch to the newer style options.

       <b>-pf</b>    set  Page  Format (PF) bit. By default it is clear (i.e. 0) unless the <u>-l</u> option is given in which
              case the Page Format bit is set (as required by SPC-3).

       <b>-raw</b>=<u>H,H...</u>
              string of comma separated hex numbers each of which should resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0  to  ff
              inclusive).  This  sequence  forms  a  diagnostic  page  to  be sent with the SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC
              command. Mostly likely the <u>-pf</u> option should also be given.

       <b>-raw=-</b> reads sequence of bytes from stdin. The sequence may be comma, space, tab  or  linefeed  (newline)
              separated.  If  a  line  contains  "#"  then  the  remaining  characters on that line are ignored.
              Otherwise each non separator character should resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0  to  ff  inclusive).
              This  sequence  forms  a  diagnostic page to be sent with the SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command. Mostly
              likely the <u>-pf</u> option should also be given.

       <b>-s</b>=<u>ST</u>  where <u>ST</u> is the self-test code. The default value is 0 which is inactive. A value of 1  selects  a
              background  short  self-test;  2  selects  a background extended self-test; 5 selects a foreground
              short self-test; 6 selects a foreground extended test. A value of  4  will  abort  a  (background)
              self-test that is in progress. This option is mutually exclusive with default self-test (i.e. <u>-t</u>).

       <b>-t</b>     sets  the  _default_  Self  Test  (SelfTest)  bit. By default this is clear (0).  The <u>-s=ST</u> option
              should not be active together with this option.  Both the <u>-doff</u> and/or <u>-uoff</u> options can  be  used
              with this option.

       <b>-T</b>=<u>SECS</u>
              where  <u>SECS</u>  is  a  timeout  value  (in  seconds)  for  foreground  self-test  operations. See the
              <u>--timeout=SECS</u> option above.

       <b>-uoff</b>  set the Unit Offline (UnitOffL)  bit  (default  is  clear).  Equivalent  to  <u>--uoff</u>  in  the  main
              description.

       <b>-v</b>     increase level of verbosity. Can be used multiple times.

       <b>-V</b>     print out version string then exit.

       <b>-?</b>     output usage message. Ignore all other parameters.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The examples sub-directory in the sg3_utils packages contains two example scripts that turn on the CJTPAT
       (jitter pattern) on some SAS disks (one script for each phy). One possible invocation for phy 1 is:

         sg_senddiag --pf --raw=- /dev/sg2 &lt; sdiag_sas_p1_cjtpat.txt

       There  is  also an example script that turns on the IDLE pattern. Once a test pattern has been started it
       can be turned off by resetting the phy or with the STOP phy pattern function:

         sg_senddiag --pf --raw=- /dev/sg2 &lt; sdiag_sas_p1_stop.txt

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Since sg3_utils version 1.23 the environment variable SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS can be given. When it is present
       this utility will expect the older command line options. So the presence of this environment variable  is
       equivalent to using <u>--old</u> (or <u>-O</u>) as the first command line option.
