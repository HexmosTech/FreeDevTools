       sg_sat_identify - send ATA IDENTIFY DEVICE command via SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) layer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sg_sat_identify</b>  [<u>--ck_cond</u>]  [<u>--extend</u>]  [<u>--help</u>]  [<u>--hex</u>]  [<u>--ident</u>]  [<u>--len=CLEN</u>]  [<u>--packet</u>]  [<u>--raw</u>]
       [<u>--readonly</u>] [<u>--verbose</u>] [<u>--version</u>] <u>DEVICE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This utility sends either an ATA IDENTIFY DEVICE command or an ATA  IDENTIFY  PACKET  DEVICE  command  to
       <u>DEVICE</u>  and  outputs  the  response.  The  devices that respond to these commands are ATA disks and ATAPI
       devices respectively.  Rather than send these commands directly to the device they are sent  via  a  SCSI
       transport which is assumed to contain a SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) Layer (SATL). The SATL may be in an
       operating system driver, in host bus adapter firmware or in some external enclosure.

       The  SAT  standard  (SAT  ANSI INCITS 431-2007, prior draft: sat-r09.pdf at www.t10.org) defines two SCSI
       "ATA PASS-THROUGH" commands: one using a 16 byte "cdb" and the other with a 12  byte  cdb.  This  utility
       defaults  to using the 16 byte cdb variant. SAT-4 revision 5 added a SCSI "ATA <a href="../man32/PASS-THROUGH.32.html">PASS-THROUGH</a>(32)" command.
       SAT-2 and SAT-3 are now also standards: SAT-2 ANSI INCITS 465-2010 and SAT-3 ANSI INCITS 517-2015  .  The
       SAT-4 project is near standardization and the most recent draft is sat4r06.pdf .

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--ck_cond</b>
              sets the CK_COND bit in the ATA PASS-THROUGH SCSI cdb. The default setting is clear (i.e. 0). When
              set  the  SATL  should  yield  a  sense  buffer containing a ATA Result descriptor irrespective of
              whether the command succeeded or failed. When clear the SATL should  only  yield  a  sense  buffer
              containing a ATA Result descriptor if the command failed.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--extend</b>
              sets  the EXTEND bit in the ATA PASS-THROUGH SCSI cdb. The default setting is clear (i.e. 0). When
              set a 48 bit LBA command is sent to the device. This option has no effect when <u>--len=12</u>.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              outputs the usage message summarizing command line options then exits. Ignores <u>DEVICE</u> if given.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b>
              outputs the ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE response in hex. The default  action  (i.e.  without  any
              '-H'  options)  is to output the response in hex, grouped in 16 bit words (i.e. the ATA standard's
              preference).  When given once, the response is output in ASCII hex bytes (i.e. the SCSI standard's
              preference). When given twice (i.e. '-HH') the output is in hex, grouped in 16 bit words, the same
              as the default but without a header. When given thrice (i.e. '-HHH') the output is in hex, grouped
              in 16 bit words, in a format that is acceptable for 'hdparm --Istdin' to process.  '-HHHH'  simply
              outputs hex data bytes, space separated, 16 per line.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ident</b>
              outputs  the  World  Wide  Name  (WWN)  of the device. This should be a NAA-5 64 bit number. It is
              output in hex prefixed with "0x". If  not  available  then  "0x0000000000000000"  is  output.  The
              equivalent for a SCSI disk (i.e. its logical unit name) can be found with "sg_vpd -ii".

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--len</b>=CLEN
              CLEN this is the length of the SCSI cdb used for the ATA PASS-THROUGH command.  CLEN can either be
              12,  16 or 32. The default is 16. The larger cdb sizes are needed for 48 bit LBA addressing of ATA
              devices. The ATA Auxiliary and ICC registers are only conveyed with the 32 byte cdb variant.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--packet</b>
              send an ATA IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE command (via the SATL). The default action is to  send  an  ATA
              IDENTIFY  DEVICE  command. Note that the ATAPI specification by T13 (i.e. the PACKET interface) is
              now obsolete.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>
              output the ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE response in binary. The output should be piped to  a  file
              or another utility when this option is used.  The binary is sent to stdout, and errors are sent to
              stderr.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--readonly</b>
              open  the  <u>DEVICE</u>  read-only  (e.g.  in  Unix  with the O_RDONLY flag).  The default is to open it
              read-write.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increases the level or verbosity.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print out version string

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Since the response to the IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE command is very important for the correct  use  of  an
       ATA(PI)  device  (and  is typically the first command sent), a SATL should provide an ATA Information VPD
       page which contains the similar information.

       The SCSI ATA PASS-THROUGH (12) command's opcode is 0xa1 and it clashes with the MMC set's  BLANK  command
       used  by  cd/dvd writers. So a SATL in front of an ATAPI device that uses MMC (i.e. has peripheral device
       type 5) probably should treat opcode 0xa1 as a BLANK command and send it through to the cd/dvd drive. The
       ATA PASS-THROUGH (16) command's opcode (0x85) does not clash with anything so it is a better choice.

       Prior to Linux kernel 2.6.29 USB mass storage limited sense data to 18 bytes  which  made  the  <b>--ck_cond</b>
       option yield strange (truncated) results.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       These  examples  use  Linux  device names and a Linux utility called hdparm. For suitable device names in
       other supported Operating Systems see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

       In this example /dev/sdb is a SATA 2.5"  disk  connected  via  a  USB  (type  C  connector)  dongle  that
       implements  the UAS (USB attached SCSI) protocol (also known as UASP). UAS is a vast improvement over the
       USB mass storage class.

           # sg_sat_identify /dev/sdb
           Response for IDENTIFY DEVICE ATA command:
           00   0c5a 3fff c837 0010 0000 0000 003f 0000  .Z ?. .7 .. .. .. .? ..
        ....

       The hexadecimal ASCII (with plain ASCII to the right) output is abridged to a single line (i.e. the first
       16 bytes (or 8 words)). Now to decode some of that ATA Identify response. First sg_inq can decode  a  few
       strings:

           # sg_sat_identify -HHHH /dev/sdb | sg_inq --ata -I -
           ATA device: model, serial number and firmware revision:
           ST9500420AS     5VJCE6R7 0002SDM1

       For a lot more details, the hdparm utility is a good choice:

           # sg_sat_identify -HHH /dev/sdb | hdparm --Istdin
           ATA device, with non-removable media
               Model Number:       ST9500420AS
               Serial Number:      5VJCE6R7
               Firmware Revision:  0002SDM1
               Transport:          Serial
           Standards:
           ....

       There  are  about  80 more lines of details decoded by hdparm in this case.  Notice the difference in the
       number of "H" options: three give an unadorned hex output arranged in (little endian) words (i.e. 16 bits
       each) while four "H" options give an unadorned hex output in bytes (i.e. 8 bits each).

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_sat_identify is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.
