</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       smp_zoned_broadcast - invoke ZONED BROADCAST SMP function

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>smp_zoned_broadcast</b>  [<u>--broadcast=BT</u>]  [<u>--expected=EX</u>]  [<u>--fszg=FS</u>] [<u>--help</u>] [<u>--hex</u>] [<u>--interface=PARAMS</u>]
       [<u>--raw</u>] [<u>--sa=SAS_ADDR</u>] [<u>--szg=ZGL</u>] [<u>--verbose</u>] [<u>--version</u>] <u>SMP_DEVICE[,N]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sends a SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP) ZONED BROADCAST function request to an SMP target.  The  SMP
       target  is  identified  by the <u>SMP_DEVICE</u> and the <u>--sa=SAS_ADDR</u>. Depending on the interface, the <u>SAS_ADDR</u>
       may be deduced from the <u>SMP_DEVICE</u>. The  mpt  interface  uses  <u>SMP_DEVICE</u>  to  identify  a  HBA  (an  SMP
       initiator) and needs the additional <u>,N</u> to differentiate between HBAs if there are multiple present.

       This  function  requires zoning to be enabled. To send a Broadcast (Change) in the absence of zoning, the
       least intrusive way seems to be to use a PHY CONTROL request to send a link reset  to  an  expander  phy.
       Broadcast  (Change) should cause a management application client behind an SMP initiator port (e.g. a SAS
       HBA) to start a discover process.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--broadcast</b>=<u>BT</u>
              <u>BT</u> is the broadcast type, an  integer  in  the  range  0  (default)  to  15.   Broadcast  (Change)
              corresponds to 0 and will cause SMP initiators that receive it to do their discover process. Other
              known  broadcast types are listed in the NOTES section. <u>BT</u> may be decimal (default) or hexadecimal
              prefixed by '0x' (or '0X') or with a 'h' (or 'H') suffix.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--expected</b>=<u>EX</u>
              set the 'expected expander change count' field in the SMP request.  The value  <u>EX</u>  is  from  0  to
              65535  inclusive  with  0  being the default value. When <u>EX</u> is greater than zero then if the value
              doesn't match the expander change count of the SMP target (i.e. the  expander)  when  the  request
              arrives then the target ignores the request and sets a function result of "invalid expander change
              count"  in  the  response.   In  SPL-1  this field is marked as "restricted (for expected expander
              change count)".

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--fszg</b>=<u>FS</u>
              where <u>FS</u> is the name of a file which contains one or more source zone groups to send  a  broadcast
              to. The zone groups can be given in decimal (default) or hexadecimal prefixed by '0x' (or '0X') or
              with a 'h' (or 'H') suffix. A zone group is a number in the range 0 to 255. Each zone group can be
              separated by space, tab, comma or newline. Empty lines and those starting with "#" are ignored.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              output the usage message then exit.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b>
              output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--interface</b>=<u>PARAMS</u>
              interface  specific  parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the path through the operating
              system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils man page for more information.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>
              send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error messages are sent to stderr.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--sa</b>=<u>SAS_ADDR</u>
              specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device. The mpt interface needs  this  option  and  it
              will typically be an expander's SAS address. The <u>SAS_ADDR</u> is in decimal but most SAS addresses are
              shown  in  hexadecimal.   To  give  a  number  in  hexadecimal either prefix it with '0x' or put a
              trailing 'h' on it.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--szg</b>=<u>ZGL</u>
              one or more source zone groups for broadcast can appear as a comma separated list <u>ZGL</u>. The may  be
              decimal  (default) or hexadecimal prefixed by '0x' (or '0X') or with a 'h' (or 'H') suffix. A zone
              group is a number in the range 0 to 255. Either this option or <u>--fszg=FS</u> (but not both) should  be
              given.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print the version string and then exit.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The following is a list of broadcast types:
       0        Broadcast (Change)
       1        Broadcast (Reserved change 0)
       2        Broadcast (Reserved change 1)
       3        Broadcast (SES)
       4        Broadcast (Expander)
       5        Broadcast (Asynchronous event)
       6        Broadcast (Reserved 3)
       7        Broadcast (Reserved 4)
       8        Broadcast (Zone activate)

       The remaining zone types (9 to 15) may be issued by the ZONED BROADCAST function.

</pre><h4><b>CONFORMING</b> <b>TO</b></h4><pre>
       The SMP ZONED BROADCAST function was introduced in SAS-2 .
