       smp_conf_phy_event - invoke CONFIGURE PHY EVENT function

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>smp_conf_phy_event</b>    [<u>--clear</u>]    [<u>--enumerate</u>]    [<u>--expected=EX</u>]    [<u>--file=FILE</u>]   [<u>--help</u>]   [<u>--hex</u>]
       [<u>--interface=PARAMS</u>]  [<u>--pes=PES,PES...</u>]    [<u>--phy=ID</u>]   [<u>--raw</u>]   [<u>--sa=SAS_ADDR</u>]   [<u>--thres=THR,THR...</u>]
       [<u>--verbose</u>] [<u>--version</u>] <u>SMP_DEVICE[,N]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sends  a  SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP) CONFIGURE PHY EVENT function request to an SMP target. The
       SMP target is identified by the <u>SMP_DEVICE</u>  and  the  <u>--sa=SAS_ADDR</u>.  Depending  on  the  interface,  the
       <u>SAS_ADDR</u>  may be deduced from the <u>SMP_DEVICE</u>. The mpt interface uses <u>SMP_DEVICE</u> to identify a HBA (an SMP
       initiator) and needs the additional <u>,N</u> to differentiate between HBAs if there are multiple present.

       The function request contains zero or more phy event configuration descriptors. Each descriptor is 8 byte
       long and contains a phy event source (one byte long) and optionally a peak value detector threshold which
       is 32 bits long (4 bytes). These values can either be supplied on the command line as  the  arguments  to
       the <u>--pes</u> and <u>--thres</u> options, or within a <u>FILE</u> given to the <u>--file</u> option.

       Once  a  phy  event source has been configured by this function, its counters should be readable with the
       REPORT PHY EVENT or REPORT PHY EVENT LIST functions.  Peak  value  detector  thresholds  should  only  be
       non-zero  for  phy  event sources whose type is "peak value detector". If the threshold value is exceeded
       the expander will originate a Broadcast(Expander).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--clear</b>
              sets the CLEAR PEAKS bit the in function  request.  This  will  cause  all  peak  value  detectors
              associated with this phy (i.e. <u>ID</u>) to be cleared to zero.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--enumerate</b>
              enumerate  all  of  the  known  Phy Event Source names, one per line preceded by its value in hex.
              Ignores <u>SMP_DEVICE</u> if it is given; most other options are also ignored. Exits after displaying the
              names.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--expected</b>=<u>EX</u>
              set the 'expected expander change count' field in the SMP request.  The value  <u>EX</u>  is  from  0  to
              65535  inclusive  with  0  being the default value. When <u>EX</u> is greater than zero then if the value
              doesn't match the expander change count of the SMP target (i.e. the  expander)  when  the  request
              arrives then the target ignores the request and sets a function result of "invalid expander change
              count" in the response.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              where <u>FILE</u> is a file name containing pairs of values. The first member of each pair is a phy event
              source  and  the  second  member  of  the  pair  is  a  peak  value detector threshold. Values are
              interpreted as decimal unless prefixed by '0x' or  '0X'  (or  it  has  a  trailing  'h'  or  'H').
              Everything from and including a "#" on a line is ignored as are blank lines.  Values may be comma,
              space and tab separated or appear on separate lines.  This option cannot be present with the <u>--pes</u>
              option.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              output the usage message then exit.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b>
              output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--interface</b>=<u>PARAMS</u>
              interface  specific  parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the path through the operating
              system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils man page for more information.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--phy</b>=<u>ID</u>
              phy identifier. <u>ID</u> is a value between 0 and 254 (default 0).

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--pes</b>=<u>PES,PES...</u>
              where <u>PES,PES...</u> is a string of comma (or space) separated values  that  are  interpreted  as  phy
              event sources (each a value from 0 to 255).  Each number is interpreted as decimal unless prefixed
              by  '0x' or '0X' (or it has a trailing 'h' or 'H'). An argument that contains any space separators
              needs to be quoted (or otherwise escaped). When this option is given then the <u>--thres</u>  option  may
              also be given and they should contain the same number of elements in their arguments.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>
              send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error messages are sent to stderr.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--sa</b>=<u>SAS_ADDR</u>
              specifies  the  SAS  address  of the SMP target device. The mpt interface needs this option and it
              will typically be an expander's SAS address. The <u>SAS_ADDR</u> is in decimal but most SAS addresses are
              shown in hexadecimal.  To give a number in hexadecimal  either  prefix  it  with  '0x'  or  put  a
              trailing 'h' on it.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--thres</b>=<u>THR,THR...</u>
              where  <u>THR,THR...</u>  is  a  string of comma (or space) separated values that are interpreted as peak
              value detector thresholds (each a 32 bit value).  Each number is  interpreted  as  decimal  unless
              prefixed  by  '0x'  or '0X' (or it has a trailing 'h' or 'H'). An argument that contains any space
              separators needs to be quoted (or otherwise escaped). When this option is  given  then  the  <u>--pes</u>
              option must also be given and they should contain the same number of elements in their arguments.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print the version string and then exit.
