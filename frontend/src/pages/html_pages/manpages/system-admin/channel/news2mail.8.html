</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       news2mail - Channel script to gateway news into e-mails

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>news2mail</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>news2mail</b> runs as a channel process underneath <b>innd</b>.  It is set up as channel feed in <u>newsfeeds</u>, with
       different mailing-lists as funnel entries pointing to it (see below); <b>news2mail</b> expects the token of an
       article followed by a sequence of list names.

       <b>news2mail</b> uses the configuration file <u>pathetc</u>/news2mail.cf to map mailing-list names to e-mail addresses.
       <b>news2mail</b> causes the mail transport agent (usually <b>sendmail</b>, as set in the <u>mta</u> parameter in <u>inn.conf</u>) to
       queue the messages for later delivery (to avoid DOS attacks by mass postings).  You must run "sendmail
       -q" periodically to get the queue processed.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file format is simple: comments (starting with a hash sign "#") and blank lines are
       ignored.  All other lines have two or three fields on them.  The first is the list name and is what <b>innd</b>
       uses (i.e. the site field of the entry in the <u>newsfeeds</u> file).  The second field is the actual e-mail
       address to send the article to.  The third field is optional: it sets the envelope-from address (for
       instance a list member's address; if not set, it defaults to the "news" user).

       In e-mail messages, the To header field body will have the mailing-list address (i.e. the second field).
       Besides, <b>news2mail</b> strips most article header fields from the article before mailing.

       In <u>newsfeeds</u>, the channel feed should look like:

           news2mail!:!*:Ac,Tc,Wn*:&lt;pathbin&gt;/news2mail

       and for each mailing-list, you only have to add to <u>newsfeeds</u> an entry list like:

           list-big-red-ants/lists.ucsd.edu\
               :!*,rec.pets.red-ants\
               :Ap,Tm:news2mail!

       Please note the use of "Ap" and the exclusion of the list owner domain to protect the list from feeding
       back new arrivals from the list.  The site name used in the <u>newfeeds</u> entry for a mailing-list (above
       "list-big-red-ants") must be the same as the first field in an entry in <u>news2mail.cf</u>.  For instance:

           # newsfeeds-name   list-to-address      [list-sender-address]
           list-big-red-ants  <a href="mailto:ants@lists.ucsd.edu">ants@lists.ucsd.edu</a>  news+<a href="mailto:ants@news.server.org">ants@news.server.org</a>

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>pathbin</u>/news2mail
           The Perl program itself used to gateway news into e-mails.

       <u>pathetc</u>/news2mail.cf
           The configuration file which specifies the mapping to use for gatewaying.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>news2mail</b> program is set up as a funnelled channel in <u>newsfeeds</u>, implying multiple matches should be
       handled as one - and multiple matching funnelled feeds will result  in  a  single  call  to  the  script.
       Therefore,  since  only  one  mail  is  sent,  crossposts  are  not currently properly handled as for the
       envelope-from address (which then defaults to the "news" user).

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>news2mail</b> was written by Brian Kantor in 1998.  This man page was written by James Brister and  converted
       to POD by Julien Elie.  The third optional field in <u>news2mail.cf</u> was added by D. Stussy in 2008.
