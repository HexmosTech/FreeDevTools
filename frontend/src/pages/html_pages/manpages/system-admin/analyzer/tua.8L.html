</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       TUA - The Uucp Analyzer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tua</b> [ option ]

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page is no longer supported. See <u>tua.texinfo</u> for up-to-dated information.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  purpose  of  the  <u>TUA</u> utility is to produce a readable and complete analysis of the <u>HoneyDanBer</u> UUCP
       connections.  This manual page describes the <u>TUA</u> command line options and shortly explains its output.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       To specify any of the options, you can use either the short form or the more mnemonic long form.  In  the
       latter  case,  you  can  abbreviate  the  name  as long as it is unique. For more information on the long
       format, please refer to the <u>GNU</u> <u>getopt</u> package description.

       <b>-S,</b> <b>+no-sys-rep</b>
            Do not print the <b>per</b> <b>System</b> <b>report</b>.  The default is to print it out.

       <b>-U,</b> <b>+no-user-rep</b>
            Do not print the <b>per</b> <b>User</b> <b>report</b>.  The default is to print it out.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>+no-daily-rep</b>
            Do not print the <b>Daily</b> <b>report</b>.  The default is to print it out.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>+command-lists</b>
            Show also the command lists. It is off by default because it makes <u>TUA</u> very hungry of memory.

       <b>-O,</b> <b>+only-system</b> <u>SYSTEM</u>
            Consider just system <u>SYSTEM</u> in the reports. You can specify more than one of this option, so you can
            have <u>TUA</u> consider just those systems.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>+no-monthly-act</b>
            Do not output the last 12 months activity summary.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>+no-history</b>
            Do not output the history at the end of the reports.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>+separate-com</b>
            Separate command lists from the other data. So there will be two tables with the header <u>By</u> <u>System</u>  <u>,</u>
            the  first  containing  only  the  amounts  and the timing of each transfer, the second with all the
            commands invoked by each System. You must specify also the <b>-C</b> option to make it works.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>+kill-system</b> <u>SYSTEM</u>
            Eliminate each reference to <u>SYSTEM</u> from the reports. Neither  the  transfer  table  nor  the  <u>SYSTEM</u>
            command list will be printed.

       <b>-K,</b> <b>+kill-user</b> <u>USER</u>
            Like <b>-k</b> , but it applies to the user called <u>USER</u> <u>.</u>

       <b>-H,</b> <b>+update-hist</b>
            Update  the  <u>history</u>  database  (see the FILES section below) with the new values. You must have the
            <b>uucp</b> write permission.

       <b>-0,</b> <b>+reset-hist</b>
            Reset the <u>history</u> database, deleting any systems in it. Then put in the database the analysis  since
            the last <u>uuclean</u> <u>.</u>  You have to specify also <b>-H</b> to make this option do his job.

       <b>-y,</b> <b>+no-hourly-chart</b>
            Do not display the hourly activity chart.

       <b>-z,</b> <b>+chart-size</b> <u>SIZE</u>
            Set  the  size of the hourly activity chart to <u>SIZE</u> rows. The greater is this number, the smaller is
            the scale. By default it is set to 10.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>+chart-only</b>
            Display only the hourly activity chart. Since with this options <u>TUA</u> reads only <b>.Admin/xferstats</b>,  it
            is faster.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>+verbose</b>
            Print,  on standard error, what is going on. While <u>TUA</u> reads the various logs, it displays a counter
            of the loaded lines.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>+prefix-path</b> <u>PATH</u>
            By default, <u>TUA</u> looks for uucp data in  <b>/usr/spool/uucp/</b>  and  in  the  relative  subdirectory.  For
            debugging purpose, this option lets you change this directory, so that <u>TUA</u> looks for the data in the
            specified <u>PATH.</u>  Below this point <u>TUA</u> needs a hierarchy like the standard one (see FILES below).

       <b>-u,</b> <b>+user-alias</b> <u>USER=ALIAS</u>
            Inserts  ALIAS  as  the  new  name for USER. Where ever appears USER it will be replaced with ALIAS.
            Since this occurs at the lowest level, if happens that ALIAS is another user name, this  will  cause
            that all the data that belongs to USER will be added to the ALIAS user.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>+port-alias</b> <u>PORT=ALIAS</u>
            Like  <b>-u</b>  ,  but  it applies to the serial port names. This can be useful on those OS where a single
            serial port has two names, one for normal use and the other with modem control (eg.  <b>tty1a</b> and <b>tty1A</b>
            ).

       <b>-s,</b> <b>+sys-alias</b> <u>SYS=ALIAS</u>
            Like <b>-u</b> , but it applies to the systems names.

       <b>-E,</b> <b>+glob-user-alias</b> <u>GLOB=ALIAS</u>

       <b>-R,</b> <b>+glob-port-alias</b> <u>GLOB=ALIAS</u>

       <b>-M,</b> <b>+glob-sys-alias</b> <u>GLOB=ALIAS</u>
            These are the counterpart respectively of <b>-u</b> , <b>-r</b> and <b>-s</b> with <b>meta-characters</b> searches. You can  use
            for example

                    tua +glob-user-alias uu*=UUCPUSERS

            and  every  user name that begins with <b>uu</b> will be mapped in a meta user called <b>UUCPUSERS</b> <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a>(1)</u> for a
            description of <b>meta-characters</b>

       <b>-i,</b> <b>+help</b>
            Show a summary and a description of all the options.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       All reports are printed on the standard output, so you  can  easily  redirect  them  wherever  you  want.
       Assuming,  unless otherwise stated, that you do not explicity request to disable some of the reports (eg.
       when you do not specify any command line option), here is a short description of what you get.

       <b>By</b> <b>System</b>

       With this report, you get all the information relative to all the nodes that talk with your  machine  but
       those  which  didn't  sent or received something. The data are divided in <u>inbound</u> and <u>outbound.</u>  For each
       system, displayed in alphabetical order, you have the total count of  the  files  transferred,  with  the
       relative  bytes  and times, as well as an average transfer rate (ATP).  If <b>+commands-lists</b> was specified,
       next there is the list of the commands invoked by that node, or directed to it. If a command is preceeded
       by a number between brackets, that number indicates how many times that command was invoked.

       <b>By</b> <b>User</b>

       This report is similar to the previous one, but it shows, in alphabetical order for each local user,  all
       the commands the user invoked, and the transfers he caused.

       <b>By</b> <b>Day</b>

       This  report  summarize  the per day activity on the local machine. It doesn't depend on the destinations
       and on the users.

       <b>SUMMARY</b> <b>by</b> <b>System</b>

       It shows a summary of the activity of each system, and the number of calls (inbound and outbound) for it.
       Please note that sometimes <u>TUA</u> fails in calculating the exact number of calls, because of the  misleading
       log of uucico. Note also that the "total connection time" always differs from the sum of the trasmissions
       times,  because  it  takes  care  also  of the various uucp dead time. In fact, it is calculated from the
       difference between the time in which the nodes are really connected (ie. at the end of dial  phase,  when
       the  modem  answers) and the time in which the link is dropped, due to the the end of the conversation as
       well as to any error.  Then comes the time of the last connection with that system.  There  is  also  the
       subdivision  of  the  connection  time  based  on  the phone costs, ie "day", "evening", "night". This is
       completely configurable, so if your telephone company uses a different hourly division you can adjust  it
       (see <b>config.h</b> and <b>phonesw.c</b>.)

       <b>SUMMARY</b> <b>by</b> <b>System</b> <b>(table</b> <b>format)</b>

       Substancially, this report summarizes some of the previous informations in a tabular form. Nothing new...

       <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>...</b>

       This  is  the  historical  data maintained by <u>TUA.</u>  It looks like the previous table, but it includes the
       history of the system, incrementally.

       <b>Last</b> <b>12</b> <b>Months</b> <b>Activity</b>

       This table shows the activity of the local machine during the  last  12  months.   Only  the  transferred
       amounts are computed.
       The  months  are  displayed  in  a manner so that the last column contains the current one, so it is very
       readable (of course, it is a matter of opinions!)

       <b>Hourly</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>(per</b> <b>communication</b> <b>port)</b>

       This chart shows the uucp hourly load for each used communication port.   Each  hour  is  divided  in  20
       minutes slices.

       <b>Global</b> <b>Hourly</b> <b>Activity</b>

       The same as the previous chart, but it reports the sums of all the ports.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <u>TUA</u>  maintains  a  database  with  the  history of each system and of the activity in each of the last 12
       months activities. It is usually located in <b>/usr/spool/uucp/.Admin/tua.history</b>  and  it  is  actually  an
       ASCII file. It is up to you to update it or not, because probably you will like to run <u>TUA</u> simply to have
       a  notion of what is going on. To make it working correctly, you have to run <u>TUA</u> with the option <b>+update-</b>
       <b>hist</b> just before you run uuclean. So probably you will have to modify that script including in it a  line
       like

               tua +update-hist {whatever options you like} ⎪ mail lele

       before it cleans up the uucp logs.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Since  HDB-Uucp doesn't put a complete datestamp in its logs, but omits the year, it may be possible that
       <u>TUA</u> fails to compute the various times in the first analysis of the year.  This  is  in  my  opinion  its
       major  weakness.  For this silliness, <u>TUA</u> cannot correctly handle logs that cover several years. There is
       little that I can do to correct the situation; I tried to adjust the  year  when  the  to-be-parsed  date
       refers obviously to the previous year, but this is just a work-around...

       There  is  a limit: if your system spent more than 9999 hours linked with someone (or the sum exceed that
       value), the reports will be garbaged...

</pre><h4><b>DISCLAIMER</b></h4><pre>
       <u>TUA</u> is <b>free</b>, and it is redistribuitable under the terms of the GNU General Public License. You can find a
       copy of it in the file <b>COPYING</b> in the distribution package.  I reject any responsability about it. It  is
       simple and safe, but I did not try it under all the possible conditions and environments, so if it causes
       you  some  trouble,  I'll  be sad for a while, but that's it. However, I will try to correct any bugs you
       will tell me.

       And <b>please,</b> forgive my poor english, but I put my soul in it...

       I want to thank expecially Marco Lorenzini  (<a href="mailto:marlor@gear.sublink.org">marlor@gear.sublink.org</a>)  for  his  help  in  debugging  the
       previous  releases  of  <u>TUA</u>  on  the  SCO Unix architecture, and for his suggestions on the layout of the
       reports. And to the  "omnipresent"  Paolo  Ventafridda  (<a href="mailto:venta@i2ack.sublink.org">venta@i2ack.sublink.org</a>)  for  his  support  and
       interest,  and several other people that encouraged me to add more and more functionality, or that let me
       scan their huge logs.
       Thanks also to all the people that, with their PD or GPL software, helped me  indirectly  with  ideas  or
       examples.

Release 3.4                                     16 November 1991                                         <u><a href="../man8L/TUA.8L.html">TUA</a></u>(8L)
