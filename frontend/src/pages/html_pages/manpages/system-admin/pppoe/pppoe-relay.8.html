</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pppoe-relay - user-space PPPoE relay agent.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pppoe-relay</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pppoe-relay</b>  is  a  user-space  relay  agent for PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) for Linux.
       <b>pppoe-relay</b> works in concert with the <b>pppoe</b> client and <b>pppoe-server</b> server.  See  the  OPERATION  section
       later in this manual for details on how <b>pppoe-relay</b> works.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-S</b> <u>interface</u>
              Adds  the  Ethernet  interface  <u>interface</u>  to the list of interfaces managed by <b>pppoe-relay</b>.  Only
              PPPoE servers may be connected to this interface.

       <b>-C</b> <u>interface</u>
              Adds the Ethernet interface <u>interface</u> to the list of  interfaces  managed  by  <b>pppoe-relay</b>.   Only
              PPPoE clients may be connected to this interface.

       <b>-B</b> <u>interface</u>
              Adds  the  Ethernet  interface  <u>interface</u>  to the list of interfaces managed by <b>pppoe-relay</b>.  Both
              PPPoE clients and servers may be connected to this interface.

       <b>-n</b> <u>num</u> Allows at most <u>num</u> concurrent PPPoE sessions.  If not specified, the default  is  5000.   <u>num</u>  can
              range from 1 to 65534.

       <b>-i</b> <u>timeout</u>
              Specifies  the  session  idle  timeout.  If both peers in a session are idle for more than <u>timeout</u>
              seconds, the session is terminated.  If <u>timeout</u> is specified  as  zero,  sessions  will  never  be
              terminated because of idleness.

              Note  that  the idle-session expiry routine is never run more frequently than every 30 seconds, so
              the timeout is approximate.  The default value for <u>timeout</u> is 600 seconds (10 minutes.)

       <b>-F</b>     The <b>-F</b> option causes <b>pppoe-relay</b> <u>not</u> to fork into the  background;  instead,  it  remains  in  the
              foreground.

       <b>-h</b>     The <b>-h</b> option prints a brief usage message and exits.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pppoe-relay</b>  listens  for  incoming  PPPoE PADI frames on all interfaces specified with <b>-B</b> or <b>-C</b> options.
       When a PADI frame appears, <b>pppoe-relay</b> adds a  Relay-Session-ID  tag  and  broadcasts  the  PADI  on  all
       interfaces specified with <b>-B</b> or <b>-S</b> options (except the interface on which the frame arrived.)

       Any  PADO frames received are relayed back to the client which sent the PADI (assuming they contain valid
       Relay-Session-ID tags.)  Likewise, PADR frames from clients are  relayed  back  to  the  matching  access
       concentrator.

       When  a  PADS  frame is received, <b>pppoe-relay</b> enters the two peers' MAC addresses and session-ID's into a
       hash table.  (The session-ID seen by the access concentrator may be  different  from  that  seen  by  the
       client; <b>pppoe-relay</b> must renumber sessions to avoid the possibility of duplicate session-ID's.)  Whenever
       either  peer  sends  a session frame, <b>pppoe-relay</b> looks up the session entry in the hash table and relays
       the frame to the correct peer.

       When a PADT frame is received, <b>pppoe-relay</b> relays it to the peer and deletes the session entry  from  its
       hash table.

       If  a client and server crash (or frames are lost), PADT frames may never be sent, and <b>pppoe-relay</b>'s hash
       table can fill up with stale sessions.  Therefore, a  session-cleaning  routine  runs  periodically,  and
       removes  old  sessions  from  the  hash table.  A session is considered "old" if no traffic has been seen
       within <u>timeout</u> seconds.  When a session is deleted because of a timeout, a PADT frame  is  sent  to  each
       peer to make certain that they are aware the session has been killed.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>INVOCATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       pppoe-relay -C eth0 -S eth1

       The  example  above relays frames between PPPoE clients on the eth0 network and PPPoE servers on the eth1
       network.

       pppoe-relay -B eth0 -B eth1

       This example is a transparent relay -- frames are relayed between any mix of clients and servers  on  the
       eth0 and eth1 networks.

       pppoe-relay -S eth0 -C eth1 -C eth2 -C eth3

       This  example  relays  frames  between servers on the eth0 network and clients on the eth1, eth2 and eth3
       networks.
