</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Iptables</b>  and  <b>ip6tables</b>  are  used  to  set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv4 and IPv6 packet
       filter rules in the Linux kernel.  Several different tables may be defined.  Each table contains a number
       of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.

       Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets.  Each rule specifies what to  do  with  a
       packet  that matches.  This is called a `target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same
       table.

</pre><h4><b>TARGETS</b></h4><pre>
       A firewall rule specifies criteria for a packet and a target.  If the packet does  not  match,  the  next
       rule  in  the  chain  is  examined; if it does match, then the next rule is specified by the value of the
       target,  which  can  be  the  name  of  a  user-defined  chain,  one  of   the   targets   described   in
       <b><a href="../man8/iptables-extensions.8.html">iptables-extensions</a></b>(8), or one of the special values <b>ACCEPT</b>, <b>DROP</b> or <b>RETURN</b>.

       <b>ACCEPT</b>  means  to let the packet through.  <b>DROP</b> means to drop the packet on the floor.  <b>RETURN</b> means stop
       traversing this chain and resume at the next rule in the previous (calling)  chain.   If  the  end  of  a
       built-in  chain  is  reached  or  a  rule  in  a built-in chain with target <b>RETURN</b> is matched, the target
       specified by the chain policy determines the fate of the packet.

</pre><h4><b>TABLES</b></h4><pre>
       There are currently five independent tables (which tables are present at any time depends on  the  kernel
       configuration options and which modules are present).

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--table</b> <u>table</u>
              This  option  specifies  the  packet  matching  table which the command should operate on.  If the
              kernel is configured with  automatic  module  loading,  an  attempt  will  be  made  to  load  the
              appropriate module for that table if it is not already there.

              The tables are as follows:

              <b>filter</b>:
                  This  is  the default table (if no -t option is passed). It contains the built-in chains <b>INPUT</b>
                  (for packets destined to local sockets), <b>FORWARD</b> (for packets being routed through  the  box),
                  and <b>OUTPUT</b> (for locally-generated packets).

              <b>nat</b>:
                  This  table  is  consulted  when  a  packet  that creates a new connection is encountered.  It
                  consists of four built-ins: <b>PREROUTING</b> (for altering packets as soon as they come  in),  <b>INPUT</b>
                  (for  altering  packets  destined  for  local sockets), <b>OUTPUT</b> (for altering locally-generated
                  packets before routing), and <b>POSTROUTING</b> (for altering packets as they are about to  go  out).
                  IPv6 NAT support is available since kernel 3.7.

              <b>mangle</b>:
                  This table is used for specialized packet alteration.  Until kernel 2.4.17 it had two built-in
                  chains:  <b>PREROUTING</b>  (for  altering  incoming packets before routing) and <b>OUTPUT</b> (for altering
                  locally-generated packets before routing).  Since kernel 2.4.18, three other  built-in  chains
                  are  also  supported:  <b>INPUT</b>  (for  packets coming into the box itself), <b>FORWARD</b> (for altering
                  packets being routed through the box), and <b>POSTROUTING</b> (for altering packets as they are about
                  to go out).

              <b>raw</b>:
                  This table is used mainly for configuring exemptions from connection tracking  in  combination
                  with the NOTRACK target.  It registers at the netfilter hooks with higher priority and is thus
                  called  before  ip_conntrack,  or  any  other  IP  tables.  It provides the following built-in
                  chains: <b>PREROUTING</b> (for packets arriving via any network interface) and  <b>OUTPUT</b>  (for  packets
                  generated by local processes).

              <b>security</b>:
                  This  table is used for Mandatory Access Control (MAC) networking rules, such as those enabled
                  by the <b>SECMARK</b> and <b>CONNSECMARK</b> targets.  Mandatory Access  Control  is  implemented  by  Linux
                  Security  Modules  such  as  SELinux.   The  security  table is called after the filter table,
                  allowing any Discretionary Access Control (DAC) rules in  the  filter  table  to  take  effect
                  before  MAC  rules.   This  table  provides  the following built-in chains: <b>INPUT</b> (for packets
                  coming into the box itself), <b>OUTPUT</b> (for altering locally-generated packets  before  routing),
                  and <b>FORWARD</b> (for altering packets being routed through the box).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options that are recognized by <b>iptables</b> and <b>ip6tables</b> can be divided into several different groups.

   <b>COMMANDS</b>
       These  options  specify  the  desired action to perform. Only one of them can be specified on the command
       line unless otherwise stated below. For long versions of the command and option names, you  need  to  use
       only enough letters to ensure that <b>iptables</b> can differentiate it from all other options.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--append</b> <u>chain</u> <u>rule-specification</u>
              Append  one  or  more  rules to the end of the selected chain.  When the source and/or destination
              names resolve to more  than  one  address,  a  rule  will  be  added  for  each  possible  address
              combination.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--check</b> <u>chain</u> <u>rule-specification</u>
              Check  whether  a  rule  matching the specification does exist in the selected chain. This command
              uses the same logic as <b>-D</b> to find a matching entry, but  does  not  alter  the  existing  iptables
              configuration and uses its exit code to indicate success or failure.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--delete</b> <u>chain</u> <u>rule-specification</u>
       <b>-D</b>, <b>--delete</b> <u>chain</u> <u>rulenum</u>
              Delete  one  or  more  rules from the selected chain.  There are two versions of this command: the
              rule can be specified as a number in the chain (starting at 1 for the first rule)  or  a  rule  to
              match.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--insert</b> <u>chain</u> [<u>rulenum</u>] <u>rule-specification</u>
              Insert  one  or more rules in the selected chain as the given rule number.  So, if the rule number
              is 1, the rule or rules are inserted at the head of the chain.  This is also  the  default  if  no
              rule number is specified.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--replace</b> <u>chain</u> <u>rulenum</u> <u>rule-specification</u>
              Replace  a rule in the selected chain.  If the source and/or destination names resolve to multiple
              addresses, the command will fail.  Rules are numbered starting at 1.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--list</b> [<u>chain</u>]
              List all rules in the selected chain.  If no chain is selected, all chains are listed. Like  every
              other  iptables  command,  it applies to the specified table (filter is the default), so NAT rules
              get listed by
               iptables -t nat -n -L
              Please note that it is often used with the <b>-n</b> option, in order to avoid long reverse DNS  lookups.
              It is legal to specify the <b>-Z</b> (zero) option as well, in which case the chain(s) will be atomically
              listed and zeroed.  The exact output is affected by the other arguments given. The exact rules are
              suppressed until you use
               iptables -L -v
              or <b><a href="../man8/iptables-save.8.html">iptables-save</a></b>(8).

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--list-rules</b> [<u>chain</u>]
              Print  all  rules  in  the  selected  chain.  If no chain is selected, all chains are printed like
              iptables-save. Like every other iptables command, it applies to the specified table (filter is the
              default).

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--flush</b> [<u>chain</u>]
              Flush the selected chain (all the chains in the table if none is given).  This  is  equivalent  to
              deleting all the rules one by one.

       <b>-Z</b>, <b>--zero</b> [<u>chain</u> [<u>rulenum</u>]]
              Zero  the  packet and byte counters in all chains, or only the given chain, or only the given rule
              in a chain. It is legal to specify the <b>-L</b>, <b>--list</b> (list) option  as  well,  to  see  the  counters
              immediately before they are cleared. (See above.)

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--new-chain</b> <u>chain</u>
              Create a new user-defined chain by the given name.  There must be no target of that name already.

       <b>-X</b>, <b>--delete-chain</b> [<u>chain</u>]
              Delete  the  chain  specified.   There must be no references to the chain.  If there are, you must
              delete or replace the referring rules before the chain can be deleted.  The chain must  be  empty,
              i.e.  not  contain  any  rules.   If  no argument is given, it will delete all empty chains in the
              table. Empty builtin chains can only be deleted with <b>iptables-nft</b>.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--policy</b> <u>chain</u> <u>target</u>
              Set the policy for the built-in (non-user-defined) chain to the given target.  The  policy  target
              must be either <b>ACCEPT</b> or <b>DROP</b>.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--rename-chain</b> <u>old-chain</u> <u>new-chain</u>
              Rename the user specified chain to the user supplied name.  This is cosmetic, and has no effect on
              the structure of the table.

       <b>-h</b>     Help.  Give a (currently very brief) description of the command syntax.

   <b>PARAMETERS</b>
       The  following  parameters  make up a rule specification (as used in the add, delete, insert, replace and
       append commands).

       <b>-4</b>, <b>--ipv4</b>
              This option has no effect in iptables and iptables-restore.  If a rule  using  the  <b>-4</b>  option  is
              inserted  with (and only with) <b>ip6tables-restore</b>, it will be silently ignored. Any other uses will
              throw an error. This option allows IPv4 and IPv6 rules in a single rule file  for  use  with  both
              iptables-restore and ip6tables-restore.

       <b>-6</b>, <b>--ipv6</b>
              If  a  rule  using  the  <b>-6</b>  option  is inserted with (and only with) <b>iptables-restore</b>, it will be
              silently ignored. Any other uses will throw an error. This option allows IPv4 and IPv6 rules in  a
              single  rule  file  for  use with both iptables-restore and ip6tables-restore.  This option has no
              effect in ip6tables and ip6tables-restore.

       [<b>!</b>] <b>-p</b>, <b>--protocol</b> <u>protocol</u>
              The protocol of the rule or of the packet to check.  The specified protocol can  be  one  of  <b>tcp</b>,
              <b>udp</b>, <b>udplite</b>, <b>icmp</b>, <b>icmpv6</b>, <b>esp</b>, <b>ah</b>, <b>sctp</b>, <b>mh</b> or the special keyword "<b>all</b>", or it can be a numeric
              value,   representing  one  of  these  protocols  or  a  different  one.   A  protocol  name  from
              <u><a href="file:/etc/protocols">/etc/protocols</a></u> is also allowed.  A "!" argument before the protocol inverts the test.  The  number
              zero  is  equivalent to <b>all</b>. "<b>all</b>" will match with all protocols and is taken as default when this
              option is omitted.  Note that, in ip6tables, IPv6 extension headers except <b>esp</b>  are  not  allowed.
              <b>esp</b>  and  <b>ipv6-nonext</b>  can  be  used  with  Kernel  version  2.6.11  or later.  The number zero is
              equivalent to <b>all</b>, which means that you cannot test the protocol field for the value  0  directly.
              To match on a HBH header, even if it were the last, you cannot use <b>-p</b> <b>0</b>, but always need <b>-m</b> <b>hbh</b>.

       [<b>!</b>] <b>-s</b>, <b>--source</b> <u>address</u>[<b>/</b><u>mask</u>][<b>,</b><u>...</u>]
              Source specification. <u>Address</u> can be either a network name, a hostname, a network IP address (with
              <b>/</b><u>mask</u>),  or a plain IP address. Hostnames will be resolved once only, before the rule is submitted
              to the kernel.  Please note that specifying any name to be resolved with a remote  query  such  as
              DNS  is  a really bad idea.  The <u>mask</u> can be either an ipv4 network mask (for iptables) or a plain
              number, specifying the number of 1's at the left side of the network mask.  Thus, an iptables mask
              of <u>24</u> is equivalent to <u>255.255.255.0</u>.  A "!" argument before the address specification inverts the
              sense of the address. The flag <b>--src</b> is an alias for  this  option.   Multiple  addresses  can  be
              specified,  but  this  will <b>expand</b> <b>to</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>rules</b> (when adding with -A), or will cause multiple
              rules to be deleted (with -D).

       [<b>!</b>] <b>-d</b>, <b>--destination</b> <u>address</u>[<b>/</b><u>mask</u>][<b>,</b><u>...</u>]
              Destination specification.  See the description of the <b>-s</b> (source) flag for a detailed description
              of the syntax.  The flag <b>--dst</b> is an alias for this option.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--match</b> <u>match</u>
              Specifies a match to use, that is, an extension module that tests for a specific property. The set
              of matches make up the condition under which a target is invoked. Matches are evaluated  first  to
              last  as  specified  on  the command line and work in short-circuit fashion, i.e. if one extension
              yields false, evaluation will stop.

       <b>-j</b>, <b>--jump</b> <u>target</u>
              This specifies the target of the rule; i.e., what to do if the packet matches it.  The target  can
              be  a  user-defined chain (other than the one this rule is in), one of the special builtin targets
              which decide the fate of the packet immediately, or an extension (see <b>MATCH</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TARGET</b>  <b>EXTENSIONS</b>
              below).   If  this  option  is omitted in a rule (and <b>-g</b> is not used), then matching the rule will
              have no effect on the packet's fate, but the counters on the rule will be incremented.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--goto</b> <u>chain</u>
              This specifies that the processing should continue in a user  specified  chain.  Unlike  with  the
              --jump  option,  <b>RETURN</b>  will  not continue processing in this chain but instead in the chain that
              called us via --jump.

       [<b>!</b>] <b>-i</b>, <b>--in-interface</b> <u>name</u>
              Name of an interface via which a packet was received (only for packets entering the <b>INPUT</b>, <b>FORWARD</b>
              and <b>PREROUTING</b> chains).  When the "!" argument is used before the interface  name,  the  sense  is
              inverted.   If  the  interface  name ends in a "+", then any interface which begins with this name
              will match.  If this option is omitted, any interface name will match.

       [<b>!</b>] <b>-o</b>, <b>--out-interface</b> <u>name</u>
              Name of an interface via which a packet is going to be sent (for  packets  entering  the  <b>FORWARD</b>,
              <b>OUTPUT</b>  and  <b>POSTROUTING</b>  chains).   When  the "!" argument is used before the interface name, the
              sense is inverted.  If the interface name ends in a "+", then any interface which begins with this
              name will match.  If this option is omitted, any interface name will match.

       [<b>!</b>] <b>-f</b>, <b>--fragment</b>
              This means that the rule only refers to second and further IPv4 fragments of  fragmented  packets.
              Since  there  is  no  way to tell the source or destination ports of such a packet (or ICMP type),
              such a packet will not match any rules which specify them.  When the  "!"  argument  precedes  the
              "-f"  flag,  the rule will only match head fragments, or unfragmented packets. This option is IPv4
              specific, it is not available in ip6tables.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--set-counters</b> <u>packets</u> <u>bytes</u>
              This enables the administrator to initialize the packet  and  byte  counters  of  a  rule  (during
              <b>INSERT</b>, <b>APPEND</b>, <b>REPLACE</b> operations).

   <b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       The following additional options can be specified:

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Verbose  output.  This option makes the list command show the interface name, the rule options (if
              any), and the TOS masks.  The packet and byte counters are also listed, with the suffix  'K',  'M'
              or  'G'  for  1000,  1,000,000  and 1,000,000,000 multipliers respectively (but see the <b>-x</b> flag to
              change  this).   For  appending,  insertion,  deletion  and  replacement,  this  causes   detailed
              information  on  the  rule  or rules to be printed. <b>-v</b> may be specified multiple times to possibly
              emit more detailed debug statements: Specified twice, <b>iptables-legacy</b> will  dump  table  info  and
              entries  in  libiptc, <b>iptables-nft</b> dumps rules in netlink (VM code) presentation.  Specified three
              times, <b>iptables-nft</b> will also dump any netlink messages sent to kernel.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Show program version and the kernel API used.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--wait</b> [<u>seconds</u>]
              Wait  for  the  xtables  lock.   To  prevent  multiple  instances  of  the  program  from  running
              concurrently,  an  attempt  will  be  made to obtain an exclusive lock at launch.  By default, the
              program will exit if the lock cannot  be  obtained.   This  option  will  make  the  program  wait
              (indefinitely or for optional <u>seconds</u>) until the exclusive lock can be obtained.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--numeric</b>
              Numeric output.  IP addresses and port numbers will be printed in numeric format.  By default, the
              program will try to display them as host names, network names, or services (whenever applicable).

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--exact</b>
              Expand  numbers.   Display  the  exact  value of the packet and byte counters, instead of only the
              rounded number in K's (multiples of 1000), M's (multiples of 1000K) or G's (multiples  of  1000M).
              This option is only relevant for the <b>-L</b> command.

       <b>--line-numbers</b>
              When  listing  rules, add line numbers to the beginning of each rule, corresponding to that rule's
              position in the chain.

       <b>--modprobe=</b><u>command</u>
              When adding or inserting rules into a chain, use <u>command</u> to load any necessary  modules  (targets,
              match extensions, etc).

</pre><h4><b>LOCK</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       iptables uses the <u>/run/xtables.lock</u> file to take an exclusive lock at launch.

       The <b>XTABLES_LOCKFILE</b> environment variable can be used to override the default setting.

</pre><h4><b>MATCH</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TARGET</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       iptables  can  use  extended  packet  matching  and  target modules.  A list of these is available in the
       <b><a href="../man8/iptables-extensions.8.html">iptables-extensions</a></b>(8) manpage.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Various error messages are printed to standard error.  The  exit  code  is  0  for  correct  functioning.
       Errors  which  appear  to be caused by invalid or abused command line parameters cause an exit code of 2.
       Errors which indicate an incompatibility between kernel and user space cause an exit code  of  3.  Errors
       which  indicate a resource problem, such as a busy lock, failing memory allocation or error messages from
       kernel cause an exit code of 4. Finally, other errors cause an exit code of 1.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Bugs?  What's this? ;-) Well, you might want to have a look at  https://bugzilla.netfilter.org/  <b>iptables</b>
       will  exit  immediately  with  an  error  code  of 111 if it finds that it was called as a setuid-to-root
       program.  iptables cannot be used safely in this manner because it trusts the shared libraries  (matches,
       targets) loaded at run time, the search path can be set using environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>IPCHAINS</b></h4><pre>
       This <b>iptables</b> is very similar to ipchains by Rusty Russell.  The main difference is that the chains <b>INPUT</b>
       and  <b>OUTPUT</b> are only traversed for packets coming into the local host and originating from the local host
       respectively.  Hence every packet only passes through one of the three chains (except  loopback  traffic,
       which involves both INPUT and OUTPUT chains); previously a forwarded packet would pass through all three.

       The  other  main  difference is that <b>-i</b> refers to the input interface; <b>-o</b> refers to the output interface,
       and both are available for packets entering the <b>FORWARD</b> chain.

       The various forms of NAT have been separated out; <b>iptables</b> is a pure packet filter when using the default
       `filter' table, with optional extension modules.  This should  avoid  much  of  the  confusion  over  the
       combination  of  IP  masquerading  and  packet  filtering  seen previously.  So the following options are
       handled differently:
        -j MASQ
        -M -S
        -M -L
       There are several other changes in iptables.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       Rusty Russell originally wrote iptables, in early consultation with Michael Neuling.

       Marc Boucher made Rusty abandon ipnatctl  by  lobbying  for  a  generic  packet  selection  framework  in
       iptables,  then  wrote the mangle table, the owner match, the mark stuff, and ran around doing cool stuff
       everywhere.

       James Morris wrote the TOS target, and tos match.

       Jozsef Kadlecsik wrote the REJECT target.

       Harald Welte wrote the ULOG and NFQUEUE target, the new libiptc, as well as the TTL,  DSCP,  ECN  matches
       and targets.

       The  Netfilter  Core  Team  is:  Jozsef  Kadlecsik, Pablo Neira Ayuso, Eric Leblond, Florian Westphal and
       Arturo Borrero Gonzalez.  Emeritus Core Team  members  are:  Marc  Boucher,  Martin  Josefsson,  Yasuyuki
       Kozakai, James Morris, Harald Welte and Rusty Russell.
