</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>setup-storage</b> - automatically prepare storage devices

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>setup-storage</b> [<b>-X</b>] [<b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>] [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-h</b>] [<b>-s</b>] [<b>-D</b> <u>disks</u>] [<b>-L</b> <u>directory</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Using FAI disk_config files, <b>setup-storage</b> Computes effective partition and volume sizes and executes the
       necessary commands to configure storage devices. It manages disk drives, RAID and LVM volumes, along with
       encryption  and  tmpfs.  Disks  and  partitions  are  designated by <b>disk1.2</b>, <b>disk3.1</b> etc. and may thus be
       referenced as such.  Currently,  setup-storage  handles  following  filesystems:  <b>ext2/3/4</b>,  <b>vFAT(FAT32)</b>,
       <b>msdos(FAT16)</b>,  <b>reiserFS</b>,  <b>XFS</b>  and <b>BTRFS</b> but could easily be extended to further types as well.  Once the
       storage devices are prepared, an appropriate <b><a href="../man5/fstab.5.html">fstab</a></b>(5) (and possibly also a <b><a href="../man5/crypttab.5.html">crypttab</a></b>(5) file is generated.

       Without the <b>-X</b> parameter <b>setup-storage</b> runs in test-only mode and does not execute  commands  other  than
       writing disk labels to a blank disk.

       The  exit  code  of  <b>setup-storage</b>  is 0 if all operations were performed successfully and non-zero if an
       error occurs.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-X</b>     Really write the configuration to disk. Otherwise <b>setup-storage</b> runs in test-only mode.

       <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>
              Normally <b>setup-storage</b> selects an appropriate configuration from $FAI/disk_config/ by picking  the
              class  with  the  highest priority from <u>classes</u> that has an existing file.  If however <b>-f</b> is given
              the configuration in <u>filename</u> is used.

       <b>-d</b>     Enable debugging output. Equivalent to environment variable <u>debug</u> set to  a  non-zero  value.  See
              below for further details.

       <b>-s</b>     Perform syntax check of disk_config file only and exit.

       <b>-D</b> <u>disks</u>
              Specify  the  list  of  disk  drives  to be configured using <b>setup-storage</b>. Overrides the variable
              <u>disklist</u>.  Do not forget to quote this space separated list.

       <b>-L</b> <u>directory</u>
              Use the specified directory instead of <u>LOGDIR.</u>

       <b>-h</b>     Display the synopsis and version info and exit.

       <b>-p</b>     Print the commands that would be executed, then exit.

       <b>-y</b>     Print disk variables as YAML file into disk_var.yml

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>setup-storage</b> will use the following environment variables:

       <b>disklist</b>
              If option <b>-D</b> is not used, the <u>disklist</u> variable may contain a space separated list of disk  drives
              available  in  the  system. Their order matters as they may be referred to as disk1, and so on, in
              disk_config. If unset, fai-disk-info will be called to determine the list.

       <b>debug</b>  If <u>debug</u> is set to a non-zero value all actions and details  to  track  the  operation  of  <b>setup-</b>
              <b>storage</b> are printed to stderr.

       <b>FAI</b>    The location of the config space to find the disk_config directory.

       <b>classes</b>
              The list of FAI classes to determine the appropriate configuration to choose.

       <b>LOGDIR</b> <b>setup-storage</b>  generates  disk_var.sh, fstab, and possibly crypttab (see below) in this directory.
              Defaults to /tmp/fai if unset.  Option <b>-L</b> overrides this.

       <b>flag_initial</b>
              This  variable  determines  if  partitions  should  be  preserved  when  they  are   tagged   with
              preserve_reinstall (see below for details). Normally set by the list of FAI flags (FAI_FLAGS).

       <b>SS_IGNORE_VG</b>
              This variable may contain a list of volume groups, that are ignored by setup-storage. The list can
              be  comma  or space separated. It's used by fai-diskimage.  <b>FAI_KEEP_CRYPTKEYFILE</b> If this variable
              is set, the keyfiles for disks encryption are not deleted and will be saved  into  the  local  and
              remote locations of the log files.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       If  <b>setup-storage</b>  executes  successfully,  an  <b><a href="../man5/fstab.5.html">fstab</a></b>(5)  file  matching  the  specified configuration is
       generated as $LOGDIR/fstab. Furthermore the file $LOGDIR/disk_var.sh is generated. This file defines  the
       following  variables, if not yet set: <u>SWAPLIST</u>, <u>ROOT_PARTITION</u>, <u>BOOT_PARTITION</u> (which is only set in case
       this resides on a disk drive), <u>BOOT_DEVICE</u> and <u>PHYSICAL_BOOT_DEVICES</u> (which  contains  the  list  of  all
       physical  devices  having  a  bootable  partition).   Both  <u>BOOT_PARTITION</u>  and  <u>BOOT_DEVICE</u> describe the
       partition and disk/RAID/LVM device hosting the mount point for /boot. If <a href="file:/boot">/boot</a> has no extra mount  point,
       / is used instead.  <u>PHYSICAL_BOOT_DEVICES</u> can be used to determine where a bootloader should be installed
       (this  is  useful  if  /  is  on  a  LVM  or RAID device).  You may source $LOGDIR/disk_var.sh to get the
       variables set.  The example config space shipped with FAI sources this file in  scripts/GRUB_PC/10-setup.
       If encryption was configured, a proper <b><a href="../man5/crypttab.5.html">crypttab</a></b>(5) file plus key files will be generated.

       The output of setup-storage is also written to the log file format.log.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>setup-storage</b> configures storage devices according to a FAI disk_config file. The full grammar describing
       the  syntax of these disk_config files is given below. The syntax is similar to the structure of an fstab
       file.  First we show a number of examples to give an intuition what these should look like.

       Simple configuration of /dev/sda

          disk_config disk1 disklabel:msdos bootable:3

          primary <a href="file:/boot">/boot</a>   20-100 ext4 rw
          primary swap    1G     swap sw
          primary /       12G    ext4 rw,noatime
          logical /backup 10%-   xfs  rw

       •      The first disk found is going to be partitioned. FAI looks  into  <a href="file:/proc/partitions">/proc/partitions</a>  and  sets  the
              variable  <u>disklist</u>.  The disklabel is msdos which is the default for x86. Let's assume /dev/sda is
              the first disk. Then partition /dev/sda3 is made bootable.

       •      Create a primary partition /dev/sda1 with a size between 20 and 100 MiB and mount it read-write as
              <a href="file:/boot">/boot</a>; it is formatted using ext4 filesystem.

       •      /dev/sda2 will be a swap space of 1 GiB

       •      /dev/sda3 should be formatted using ext4 filesystem

       •      Create the logical partition /dev/sda5 (because the first logical  partition  will  always  become
              number 5) Make it at least 10% of the disk size.  Use mkfs.xfs to format this partition.

       Create a software RAID

          disk_config sda
          primary   -    20G       -   -
          primary   -    4G        -   -

          disk_config sdb sameas: sda

          disk_config raid
          raid1     /    sda1,sdb1 ext4    rw
          raid1     swap sda2,sdb2 swap    sw

       •      Create  2  partitions  of size 20 and 4 GiB, respectively, on disks /dev/sda and /dev/sdb. No file
              system or fstab entry will be created. on these partitions.

       •      Create a RAID-1 on /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1, format using mkfs.ext4 and mount it as /

       •      Create a RAID-1 on /dev/sda2 and /dev/sdd2, prepare as swap space and use it as such later on.

       Advanced softRAID features

          disk_config raid
          raid1  /    sda1,sdd1  ext4          rw,errors=remount-ro
          raid0  -    disk2.2,sdc1,sde1:spare:missing ext4 default

       •      Create a RAID-1 on /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdd1, format using mkfs.ext2 and mount it as /

       •      Create a RAID-0 on the second partition of the second disk, /dev/sdc1, and /dev/sde1  as  a  spare
              partition. The latter may be missing.

       •      The  configurations  for  /dev/sda,  /dev/sdd,  disk2,  /dev/sdc, and /dev/sde are omitted in this
              example. These devices can be configured similar to the configuration shown in the first  example.
              They may also already be properly set up and hence the configuration can be left out.

       Simple LVM example

          disk_config   sda    bootable:1
          primary       <a href="file:/boot">/boot</a>  500       ext4      rw
          primary       -      4096-     -         -

          disk_config lvm
          vg     my_pv  sda2
          my_pv_swap    swap   2048      swap      sw
          my_pv_root    /      2048      ext4      rw

       •      Configure /dev/sda with two partitions.

       •      The second of those, /dev/sda2, is then used in the LVM volume group my_pv.

       •      This volume group hosts two logical volumes: _swap and _root.

       LVM on software RAID

              disk_config disk1 disklabel:msdos fstabkey:uuid
              primary     -     350     -       -
              primary     swap  2G      swap    sw,pri=1
              primary     -     0-      -       -

              disk_config disk2  sameas:disk1

              disk_config raid fstabkey:uuid
              raid1  <a href="file:/boot">/boot</a>   disk1.1,disk2.1  ext4      rw,noatime,errors=remount-ro
              raid1  -       disk1.3,disk2.3     -      -

              disk_config lvm fstabkey:uuid
              vg  vg_system     md1
              vg_system-root    /       4G-50G  ext4    rw,noatime
              vg_system-home    <a href="file:/home">/home</a>   1G-     ext4    rw,noatime,nosuid,nodev

       •      Configure the first and second disk identical with three partitions each.

       •      The first partitions of each device are bundled into a RAID 1 (/dev/md0), which will be mounted at
              /boot.

       •      The  third  partition of each device are combined as another RAID 1, but not mounted. Instead, the
              resulting device /dev/md1 is used to host the LVM volume group vg_system.

              ATTENTION! Do not forget to install the packages mdadm and lvm2 into a system using this partition
              scheme. Also set rd.auto when using dracut as initrd generator.

       Crypt example

              disk_config /dev/sdb
              primary   /         21750     ext4      defaults,errors=remount-ro
              primary   <a href="file:/boot">/boot</a>     250       ext4      defaults
              logical   -         4000      -         -
              logical   -         2000      -         -
              logical   -         10-       -         -

              disk_config cryptsetup
              swap      swap      /dev/sdb5 swap      defaults
              tmp       <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>      /dev/sdb6 ext2      defaults
              luks      /local00  /dev/sdb7 ext4      defaults,errors=remount-ro  createopts="-m 0"

       •      Configure /dev/sdb with 2 primary partitions, one extended partition, and 3 logical partitions.

       •      Encrypt the swap space, <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>, and /local00. As described in the CAVEATS  section,  the  encryption
              keys will be stored in a temporary directory only.

       •      Do not forget to install the cryptsetup package on a system using thus scheme.

       •      The  initial  password for the encrypted device can also be set in the configuration file by using
              the syntax - luks:"secret"

       •      With a working RAID+LVM configuration, an encryption layer can be added between the RAID  and  LVM
              device layers by adding the following cryptsetup configuration. In this case, the encrypted device
              will be called 'crypt_format_md1' and will be used as the underlying physical device (PV) in LVM.

              disk_config cryptsetup
              luks   -      /dev/md1      - -

       Plain disk + LUKS + LVM2 example

              disk_config disk1 disklabel:gpt bootable:1 fstabkey:uuid align-at:1M
              primary   -         100%      -         -

              disk_config cryptsetup
              luks:"passwd"       -         disk1.1   -         -

              disk_config lvm fstabkey:uuid
              vg        vg1       disk1.1
              vg1-root  /         30%-      ext4      defaults,errors=remount-ro,noatime,rw

       tmpfs example

              disk_config tmpfs
              tmpfs     <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>      RAM:20%   defaults
              tmpfs     /scratch  3GiB      defaults
              tmpfs     /scratch2 -         defaults

       •      Mount  a tmpfs on <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> with a maximum size equal to 20% of the total amount of RAM in the machine.
              This is equivalent to using size=20% in the tmpfs mount options.

       •      Mount a tmpfs on /scratch with a maximum size of 3 GiB.

       •      Mount a tmpfs on /scratch2, use the system default size for this tmpfs.

       nfs example

              disk_config nfs
              nfs 11.22.33.44:/export/vm-root/HOSTNAME          /defaults

       •      A diskless client setup. Mount the whole OS file system via NFS from an NFS server onto <a href="file:/.">/.</a>

       Simple BTRFS example

              disk_config disk1
              primary   <a href="file:/boot">/boot</a>     500       ext4      rw
              primary   -         2G-       -         -

              disk_config disk2
              primary   -         2G-       -         -

              disk_config disk3 sameas:disk2
              disk_config disk4 sameas:disk2

              disk_config btrfs fstabkey:uuid
              btrfs     raid1     /         disk1.2,disk2.1     noatime,subvol=@/
              btrfs     raid1     <a href="file:/home">/home</a>     disk3.1,disk4.1     subvol=@home,noatime

       •      Four disks are used to create a BTRFS RAID. The first disk contains the boot partition, the second
              partition of disk one and the second disk in its entirety are used to  create  the  /  RAID.   The
              third and fourth disks are used to create the <a href="file:/home">/home</a> RAID.

       •      Note  that  each  BTRFS  RAID must contain an initial subvolume. This is necessary to use advanced
              BTRFS features such as snapshots. The initial subvolume name is taken from the subvol mountoption.
              In the above example those would be @/ and @home.
               Subvolume names begin with an @ by convention.

       •      Every BTRFS line must begin with btrfs followed by the  RAID-level  of  the  actual  data  --  NOT
              metadata! By default metadata uses RAID1, however this can be changed using createopts.

       External log device example

              disk_config /dev/sda fstabkey:uuid bootable:2
              primary   /         20GiB     ext3      defaults
              primary   <a href="file:/boot">/boot</a>     250       ext2      defaults
              primary   swap      4GiB      swap      defaults
              logical   -         256       ext3_journal                  -
              logical   -         256       ext4_journal                  -
              logical   -         256       xfs_journal                   -

              disk_config /dev/sdb fstabkey:uuid
              primary   /mnt/ext3 33%       ext3:journal=/dev/sda5        defaults
              primary   /mnt/ext4 33%       ext4:journal=/dev/sda6        defaults
              primary   /mnt/xfs  33%       xfs:journal=/dev/sda7         defaults

       •      Mount an ext3 filesystem on /dev/sdb1 with an external journal on /dev/sda5

       •      Mount an ext4 filesystem on /dev/sdb2 with an external journal on /dev/sda6

       •      Mount an XFS filesystem on /dev/sdb3 using /dev/sda7 as the log device

       Example using a GPT partition table and EFI/ESP partition

              disk_config disk1 disklabel:gpt fstabkey:partlabel bootable:1
              p=efi     <a href="file:/boot/efi">/boot/efi</a> 200       vfat      rw
              p=root    /         1G-20G    ext4      rw
              p=        /data     1G-       ext4      rw

       •      Creating  a  ESP  partition for UEFI boot is very simple. Use a GPT partition table, create a vfat
              partition for <a href="file:/boot/efi">/boot/efi</a> which is also bootable. That's it.   A  name  after  p=  is  used  as  the
              partition label. Remember that GPT does not use logical partition. Just use p= for each partition.
              The  fstab  entries  will  use the partition labels if defined. Otherwise it will fall back to the
              file system UUID or the device name.  Setting fstabkey:partuuid will use the UUID of the partition
              (not the UUID of the file system) for the fstab entries.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes the syntax of disk_config files

       file ::= &lt;lines&gt; EOF

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       •      If you use software RAID or LVM in your disk config, do  not  forget  also  to  add  the  required
              packages (like mdadm and lvm2) to the package config. Otherwise the client will not be able to use
              these features.

       •      MD  devices  aka  software RAID will not be synced during a new installation because it would slow
              down the installation heavily.  Therefore setup-storage will set the sync_action of each device to
              frozen. The sync will start after the next reboot.

       •      Machine does not boot because no partition is marked as bootable: If the bootable  option  is  not
              specified,  not partition will be marked as such. Modern BIOSes don't seem to require such markers
              anymore, but for some systems it may still be necessary. Previous  versions  of  setup-storage  by
              default marked the partition mounting / as bootable, but this is not a sane default for all cases.
              If  you  want to be sure not boot failures happen because of a missing bootable marker, explicitly
              set the bootable option. Of course, there are lots of other reasons why a system may fail to boot.

       •      Crypto support requires some site-specific changes: If you use cryptsetup  stanza,  a  <b><a href="../man5/crypttab.5.html">crypttab</a></b>(5)
              file  and  key files for all luks volumes will be created (unless you used the passphrase option).
              The key files are left in /tmp/fai; you will want to copy these to some removable media.  To  make
              encrypted  root  devices  actually  usable,  you need to add busybox (and initramfs-tools) to your
              package config.

       •      For backwards compatibility or other system-specific reasons an alignment to  cylinder  boundaries
              may  be  necessary.  Other  systems might have other alignment constraints. setup-storage sets the
              alignment as follows: If align-at is set, align accordingly. Otherwise, if any  partition  on  the
              particular disk is to be preserved, default to cylinder alignment, otherwise use sector alignment.

       •      If  you use a raw partition, you should add -F to the createopts, otherwise mkfs.ext4 hangs due to
              a warning message. See man mfs.ext4 for more info on -F.  An example config using a raw disk looks
              like this: raw-disk / 4GB ext4 rw createopts="-F"
