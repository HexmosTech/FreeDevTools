       huawei-ups2000 - Driver for Huawei UPS2000 (1kVA-3kVA) UPS with USB or RS-232 serial Modbus connection.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>huawei-ups2000</b> -h

       <b>huawei-ups2000</b> -a <u>DEVICE_NAME</u> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]

           <b>Note</b>

           This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the huawei-ups2000 driver. For
           information about the core driver, see <b><a href="../man8/nutupsdrv.8.html">nutupsdrv</a></b>(8).

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       This driver supports Huawei UPS2000 series, online (double conversion) UPS with the following
       characteristics.

        1. Output power: 1 kVA to 3 kVA (higher power models are unsupported).

        2. Connection: USB or RS-232 (for most UPS models, USB is only supported on Linux 5.12 and newer
           kernels, but there are exceptions, read the section <b>Cabling</b> carefully).

       The UPS2000 series has two variants: UPS2000-A with a tower chassis, and UPS2000-G with a rack-mount
       chassis. Within these two variants, there are also two sub-variants: a standard runtime model powered by
       an internal battery pack denoted by an "S" suffix, and a long runtime model powered by an external
       battery pack denoted by an "L" suffix.

       All of these models should be equally supported, but more testers are needed. Currently, it has been
       tested on the following models.

       •   UPS2000-A-1KTTS (firmware: UPS2000A, V2R1C1SPC40, P1.0-D1.0)

       •   UPS2000-A-1KTTS (firmware: UPS2000A, V2R1C1SPC50, P1.0-D1.0)

       •   UPS2000-A-2KTTS (firmware: UPS2000A, V2R1C1SPC50, P1.0-D1.0)

       •   UPS2000-G-1KRTS (firmware: UPS2000A, V2R1C1SPC40, P1.0-D1.0)

       •   UPS2000-G-1KRTS (firmware: UPS2000G, V2R1C1SPC50, P1.0-D1.0)

       •   UPS2000-G-3KRTS (firmware: UPS2000A, V2R1C1SPC40, P1.0-D1.0)

       •   UPS2000-G-3KRTS (firmware: UPS2000G, V2R1C1SPC50, P1.0-D1.0)

       •   UPS2000-G-3KRTL (firmware: UPS2000A, V2R1C1SPC40, P1.0-D1.0)

       If your model is not in the list, we encourage you to report successful or unsuccessful results to the
       bug tracker or the mailing list. Make sure to include the full model number of your UPS manually in your
       report, because many units only report themselves as "UPS2000-A" regardless of their models, including
       the G series.

       As of 2022, there is also a new hardware variant with a WCH CH341 USB-to-serial chip instead of a
       MaxLinear/Exar RX21V1410 chip and reports itself as "UPS2000G". Driver support has been added since
       v0.03.

       huawei-ups2000 uses the libmodbus project, for Modbus implementation.

</pre><h4><b>CABLING</b></h4><pre>
       The UPS has a USB port and a RS-232 port. Both are supported, but on most UPS models, USB is only usable
       on Linux 5.12 and later, via the <b>xr_serial</b> kernel module. But for the newer hardware variant with a WCH
       CH341 chip, it should have better compatibility via the <b>ch341</b> kernel module. See subsection <b>USB</b> for
       details. On the other hand, RS-232 is always supported on all operating systems.

       Only one port can be used at a time. When USB is used, RS-232 should be unplugged from the UPS, and vice
       versa. Further, optional adapter cards, such as RS-485 or SNMP, are not supported. They should be removed
       from the UPS.

       Because the UPS port can be unresponsive under certain circumstances, it’s recommended to power cycle
       your UPS after making a cabling change, especially after changing the port type. That is, turn off the
       UPS power output via the front panel, then unplug the UPS from line power input. Wait for the LCD screen
       to go black. Finally reconnect line power and restart your UPS.

   <b>USB</b>
       The USB port on the UPS2000 is originally powered by a MaxLinear/Exar RX21V1410 USB-to-serial converter
       chip, it’s only supported by Linux 5.12 or newer, via the <b>xr_serial</b> kernel module. Its <b>lsusb</b> report is:

           04e2:1410 Exar Corp. XR21V1410 USB-UART IC

       However, a recent hardware variant switched to the WCH CH341 serial chip:

           1a86:5523 QinHeng Electronics CH341 in serial mode, usb to serial port converter

       If your unit has a WCH CH341 chip (likely only found in units made after 2022), when the UPS2000 is
       connected via USB, you should see the following logs in <b>dmesg</b>.

           ch341 2-1.2:1.0: ch341-uart converter detected
           usb 2-1.2: ch341-uart converter now attached to ttyUSB0

       If so, you should be able to proceed without worrying about kernel compatibility. This CH341 chip has
       been around for a decade and should be compatible with your system.

       On the other hand, if your unit has a MaxLinear/Exar XR21V1410 chip, like most users do, when the UPS2000
       is connected via USB to a supported Linux system, you should see the following logs in <b>dmesg</b>.

           xr_serial 1-1.2:1.1: xr_serial converter detected
           usb 1-1.2: xr_serial converter now attached to ttyUSB0

       The driver must be <b>xr_serial</b>. If your system doesn’t have the necessary device driver, you will get this
       message instead:

           cdc_acm 1-1.2:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device

       The generic driver <b>cdc_acm</b> is incompatible and cannot be used. You should upgrade your Linux kernel to
       Linux 5.12 or newer.

           <b>Warning</b>

           On an unsupported system, the XR21V1410 USB device can still be recognized as a USB ACM device, but
           communication is impossible, please don’t waste your time on <b>cdc_acm</b>.

       If you’re already running on Linux 5.12 or newer kernels, but still cannot see the <b>xr_serial</b> driver, it
       means the driver is not enabled in your kernel build. If you’re a regular user, you should file a bug
       report to your Linux distro maintainers and ask them to enable <b>xr_serial</b> (kernel option
       CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_XR).

       When upgrading the Linux kernel isn’t an option, or when you are using another operating system (e.g.
       FreeBSD), RS-232 must be used. Even for CH341 users, one can try this option if USB somehow refuses to
       work.

   <b>RS-232</b>
       RS-232 is supported on all operating systems, either via a built-in serial port on your computer, or by
       using an external USB-to-RS-232 converter. If you plan to use an USB-to-RS-232 converter, make sure it’s
       supported by your operating system.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       This driver may be not built by default. You can build it by installing libmodbus (with development
       packages) and running

           configure --with-serial=yes --with-modbus=yes

       You also need to give proper (R/W) permissions on the local serial device file to allow the NUT driver
       run-time user to access it. This may need additional setup for start-up scripting, udev or upower rules,
       to apply the rights on every boot — especially if your device nodes are tracked by a virtual filesystem.

       For example, a USB-to-serial converter can be identified as /dev/ttyACM0 or /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux, or
       /dev/ttyU0 on FreeBSD (note the capital "U"). A built-in serial port can be identified as /dev/ttyS0 on
       Linux or one of /dev/cua* names on FreeBSD.

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       This driver supports the following optional settings in the <b><a href="../man5/ups.conf.5.html">ups.conf</a></b>(5) file:

       <b>offdelay=</b><u>value</u>
           Time to wait before shutting down the UPS (seconds), acceptable range is 6 seconds (0.1 minutes) to
           5940 seconds (99 minutes). Defaults to 60 seconds. Must be a multiple of 6 seconds. To ensure your
           system has adequate time to shut down after a power failure, it’s highly recommended to adjust
           <b>offdelay</b>.

       <b>rebootdelay=</b><u>value</u>
           Time to wait before rebooting the UPS (seconds), acceptable range is 6 seconds (0.1 minutes) to 5940
           seconds (99 minutes). Defaults to 60 seconds. Must be a multiple of 6 seconds. This is used by the
           <b>shutdown.reboot.graceful</b> instant command. If you’ve adjusted <b>offdelay</b>, you should also adjust
           <b>rebootdelay</b>.

       <b>ondelay=</b><u>value</u>
           Time to wait before switching on the UPS (seconds), acceptable range is 60 seconds (1 minutes) to
           5940 seconds (99 minutes). Defaults to 60 seconds. Must be a multiple of 60 seconds (not 6 seconds).
           You don’t need to adjust this delay unless you have special requirements.

           <b>Note</b>

           Due to hardware limitation, in this driver, <b>ondelay</b> is respected only when line power is available.
           If a power failure has occurred, the UPS and the load is always immediately switched on, as soon (or
           as late) as line power is restored.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANT</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       This driver supports some instant commands (see <b><a href="../man8/upscmd.8.html">upscmd</a></b>(8)):

       <b>shutdown.stayoff</b>
           After an <b>offdelay</b>, turn off the load. When line power is back, remain off.

       <b>shutdown.return</b>
           After an <b>offdelay</b>, turn off the load. When line power is back, turn on the load, possibly after an
           <b>ondelay</b>.

           <b>Note</b>

           Normally, the load is turned on as soon as line power is back. But if line power is never lost, or
           has came back unexpectedly in the middle of an ongoing shutdown (an undesirable "power race"
           condition that many entry-level products on the market fail to recover from), the load is turned on
           after an <b>ondelay</b>. Thus, UPS2000 is unaffected by a power race, the load is guaranteed to always
           restart.

       <b>shutdown.reboot</b>
           Like <b>shutdown.return</b>, except that the load is turned off immediately (6 seconds in this
           implementation).

       <b>shutdown.reboot.graceful</b>
           Like <b>shutdown.return</b>, except that the load is turned off after a <b>rebootdelay</b>, not an <b>offdelay</b>.

       <b>beeper.enable</b>
           Enable the UPS beeper.

       <b>beeper.disable</b>
           Disable the UPS beeper.

       <b>beeper.toggle</b>
           Toggle the UPS beeper.

       <b>bypass.start</b>
           Put the UPS in bypass mode. Use with caution. It exposes your equipment to unregulated line power and
           provides no protection from power failures. Also, the UPS may shut down whenever the bypass input
           voltage is out of the nominal range. As a warning, the UPS beeps once every 10 seconds in bypass
           mode.

           <b>Note</b>

           The driver has a basic foolproof mechanism. If the bypass input is already abnormal due to a power
           failure, the driver refuses to enter bypass mode by aborting the command and logging an error.
           However, it offers no protection after the UPS has entered (or in the middle of entering) bypass
           mode. Thus, again, use with caution.

       <b>bypass.stop</b>
           Put the UPS out of bypass mode.

       <b>load.on</b>
           Turn on the load immediately.

       <b>load.off</b>
           Turn off the load immediately. Use with caution, everything on the UPS will lost power.

       <b>test.battery.start.quick</b>
           Perform a short battery test.

       <b>test.battery.start.deep</b>
           Perform a long battery test.

       <b>test.battery.stop</b>
           Stop a running battery test.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       This driver supports some writable runtime variables (see <b><a href="../man8/upsrw.8.html">upsrw</a></b>(8)):

       <b>ups.beeper.status</b>
           Enable or disable the UPS beeper, <b>disabled</b> or <b>enabled</b>.

           <b>Note</b>

           The beeper can only be disabled completely, it cannot be temporally muted until the next alarm, but
           the option <b>muted</b> is also accepted for convenience, <b>muted</b> is treated as an alias of <b>disabled</b>.

       <b>ups.delay.shutdown</b>
           Seconds to wait after shutdown with delay command. It’s the runtime equivalent of <b>offdelay</b>. See
           description of <b>offdelay</b>.

       <b>ups.delay.reboot</b>
           Seconds to wait before rebooting the UPS, it’s the runtime equivalent of <b>rebootdelay</b>. See description
           of <b>rebootdelay</b>.

       <b>ups.delay.start</b>
           Seconds to wait before restarting the load, it’s the runtime equivalent of <b>ondelay</b>. See description
           of <b>ondelay</b>.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Battery</b> <b>status</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-fatal</b> <b>read</b> <b>failure</b>
       It’s usually harmless and can be safely ignored. It’s only logged for informative purposes (<b>LOG_INFO</b>),
       not as a warning or error.

   <b>Data</b> <b>stale</b>
       Under certain circumstances, some registers can return invalid values and trigger a "data stale" error.
       Once a data stale error has occurred, you should see error messages similar to the example below in the
       system log.

           huawei-ups2000: register 2002 has invalid value a000,
           upsd: Data for UPS [huawei] is stale - check driver
           upsd: UPS [huawei] data is no longer stale

       So far all known problems have been fixed by the author, but an unknown one cannot be ruled out. If you
       have encountered "data stale" problems during normal uses, please file a bug report with full logs
       attached.

       Before troubleshooting or reporting a problem, it’s important to check your <b>dmesg</b> log for USB connect and
       disconnect events to avoid wasting time on the NUT driver when the actual problem is USB.

       For example, if someone yanks the cable out of the USB port, or if a new USB device is plugged into a USB
       host/hub that is struggling to power its ports (common on single-board computers like Raspberry Pi), or
       if you have flaky cabling or EMI noise, due to all these and similar reasons the serial converter can get
       disconnected from USB, at least briefly.

       This creates a permanent data stale situation, and the driver must be restarted (plugging the USB back
       won’t fix it, since the driver is still using the nonexistent serial device, if the system kernel
       initializes a new device driver instance internally).

       These USB problems usually have nothing to do with NUT. If it’s the case, you should solve the underlying
       USB problem — check the cable, check the converter, try a powered USB hub, try a full-speed USB isolator,
       etc.

   <b>Serial</b> <b>port</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>unresponsive</b>
       Some malformed commands are known to lock up the serial port (including USB, which is a USB-to-serial
       device). Upon receiving them, UPS2000 stops all serial communications. The result is a completely
       unresponsive UPS, regardless of what you do — restarting NUT, rebooting the computer — can not restore
       connectivity, as if someone has unplugged the RS-232 cable.

       To recover, simply power cycle the UPS: Turn off the UPS output via the front panel, then unplug the UPS
       from line power. Wait for the LCD front screen to go black. Finally reconnect line power and restart your
       UPS.

       That being said, a serial port lockup is unlikely to happen. To our best knowledge, this driver never
       sends malformed commands to the UPS (it was only a problem during early development). Furthermore, due to
       a CRC checksum, they’re unlikely to be accidentally generated.

       Still, we recommend to power cycle your UPS after making a cabling change, especially after changing from
       RS-485/USB to RS-232, just to ensure the UPS selects the correct communication interface. Also, if you
       have discovered a reproducible serial port lockup problem, it can be a previously unknown bug, so please
       make sure to file a bug report.

   <b>USB</b> <b>chip</b> <b>(MaxLinear/Exar</b> <b>RX21V1410)</b> <b>is</b> <b>unsupported</b>
       As previously stated, only RS-232 is supported on all systems. On most UPS units, the USB chip RX21V1410
       is used, and it requires a device-specific driver <b>xr_serial</b>, which is only available on Linux 5.12 and
       newer kernels.

       On an unsupported system, the USB device can still be recognized as a USB ACM device, but in reality,
       communication is impossible. It can only be fixed by implementing a driver for your system, nothing can
       be done within NUT. Please use the RS-232 port instead.

       Alternatively, if your unit has a WCH CH341 chip (likely only found in units made after 2022), it should
       have better compatibility.

       See the previous section <b>Cabling</b> for more information.

       Finally, in the unlike scenario that you are using NUT on Microsoft Windows, you should be able to
       install the USB device driver following the steps in the Huawei UPS2000 (1 kVA-3 kVA) Modbus Protocol
       Development Guide.
