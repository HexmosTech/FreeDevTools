</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       auvirt - a program that shows data related to virtual machines

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>auvirt</b> [ <u>OPTIONS</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>auvirt</b>  shows  a list of guest sessions found in the audit logs. If a guest is specified, only the events
       related to that guest is considered. To specify a guest, both UUID or VM name can be given.

       For each guest session the tool prints a record with the domain name, the user that  started  the  guest,
       the time when the guest was started and the time when the guest was stopped.

       If  the  option  "--all-events"  is given a more detailed output is shown. In this mode other records are
       shown for guest's stops, resource assignments, AVC and anomaly events.  The  first  field  indicates  the
       event type and can have the following values: start, stop, res, avc, and anom.

       Resource assignments have the additional fields: resource type, reason and resource. And AVC records have
       the following additional fields: operation, result, command and target.

       By  default,  auvirt  reads records from the system audit log file. But <b>--stdin</b> and <b>--file</b> options can be
       specified to change this behavior.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--all-events</b>
              Show records for all virtualization related events.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Print debug messages to stderr.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--file</b> <u>file</u>
              Read records from the given <u>file</u> instead from the system audit log file.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print help message and exit.

       <b>--proof</b>
              Add after each event a line containing all the identifiers of the audit records used to  calculate
              the event. Each identifier consists of unix time, milliseconds and serial number.

       <b>--show-uuid</b>
              Add the guest's UUID to each record.

       <b>--stdin</b>
              Read  records  from the standard input instead from the system audit log file.  This option cannot
              be specified with <b>--file</b>. The audit events must be in the raw format.

       <b>--summary</b>
              Print a summary with information about the events found. The summary contains the considered range
              of time, the number of guest starts and stops, the number of resource assignments, the  number  of
              AVC and anomaly events, and the number of failed operations.

       <b>-te</b>, <b>--end</b> [<u>end-date</u>] [<u>end-time</u>]
              Search  for  events with time stamps equal to or before the given end time. The format of end time
              depends on your locale. If the date is omitted, <b>today</b> is assumed. If the time is omitted,  <b>now</b>  is
              assumed.  Use  24 hour clock time rather than AM or PM to specify time.  An example date using the
              en_US.utf8 locale is 09/03/2009. An example of time is  18:00:00.  The  date  format  accepted  is
              influenced by the LC_TIME environmental variable.

              You  may  also  use  the  word:  <b>now</b>,  <b>recent</b>,  <b>today</b>, <b>yesterday</b>, <b>this-week</b>, <b>week-ago</b>, <b>this-month</b>,
              <b>this-year</b>. <b>Today</b> means starting now. <b>Recent</b> is  10  minutes  ago.  <b>Yesterday</b>  is  1  second  after
              midnight  the previous day.  <b>This-week</b> means starting 1 second after midnight on day 0 of the week
              determined by your locale (see <b>localtime</b>). <b>This-month</b> means 1 second after midnight on  day  1  of
              the month. <b>This-year</b> means the 1 second after midnight on the first day of the first month.

       <b>-ts</b>, <b>--start</b> [<u>start-date</u>] [<u>start-time</u>]
              Search  for  events  with time stamps equal to or after the given end time. The format of end time
              depends on your locale. If the date is omitted, <b>today</b> is assumed. If the time is omitted, <b>midnight</b>
              is assumed. Use 24 hour clock time rather than AM or PM to specify time. An example date using the
              en_US.utf8 locale is 09/03/2009. An example of time is  18:00:00.  The  date  format  accepted  is
              influenced by the LC_TIME environmental variable.

              You may also use the word: <b>now</b>, <b>recent</b>, <b>today</b>, <b>yesterday</b>, <b>this-week</b>, <b>this-month</b>, <b>this-year</b>.  <b>Today</b>
              means  starting  at 1 second after midnight. <b>Recent</b> is 10 minutes ago. <b>Yesterday</b> is 1 second after
              midnight the previous day.  <b>This-week</b> means starting 1 second after midnight on day 0 of the  week
              determined  by  your  locale (see <b>localtime</b>). <b>This-month</b> means 1 second after midnight on day 1 of
              the month. <b>This-year</b> means the 1 second after midnight on the first day of the first month.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--uuid</b>  <u>UUID</u>
              Only show events related to the guest with the given UUID.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--vm</b>  <u>name</u>
              Only show events related to the guest with the given name.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To see all the records in this month for a guest

       <b>auvirt</b> <b>--start</b> <b>this-month</b> <b>--vm</b> <b>GuestVmName</b> <b>--all-events</b>
