       pmvarrun - updates /var/run/pam_mount/<u>user</u>

</pre><h4><b>Syntax</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pmvarrun</b> <b>-u</b> <u>user</u> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       A  separate  program  is  needed so that /var/run/pam_mount/<u>user</u> may be created with a pam_mount-specific
       security context (otherwise SELinux policy will conflict with gdm, which also creates file in <a href="file:/var/run">/var/run</a>).

       pmvarrun is flexible and can run in a number of different security setups:

   <b>root-root</b>
       When pmvarrun is invoked as root, /var/run/pam_mount's permission settings can be as  strict  as  needed;
       usually (0755,root,root) is a good pick as it gives users the debug control over their refcount. Refcount
       files are given their respective owners (chowned to the user who logs in).

   <b>user-user</b>
       When  invoked as the user who logs in, /var/run/pam_mount needs appropriate permissions to create a file,
       which means the write bit must be set. It is also highly suggested to set the sticky bit in this case, so
       other users do not tamper with your refcount.

   <b>root-user</b>
       Some programs or login helpers incorrectly call the PAM stack in a way that the login phase  is  done  as
       root  and  the  logout  phase  as  a  normal  user.   Nevertheless,  pmvarrun supports this, and the same
       permissions as in root-root can be used. While the  user  may  not  be  able  to  unlink  his  file  from
       /var/run/pam_mount, it will be truncated to indicate the same state.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b>, <b>-h</b>
              Display help.

       <b>--user</b> <u>user</u>, <b>-u</b> <u>user</u>
              User to handle, must be a valid username.

       <b>--operation</b> <u>number</u>, <b>-o</b> <u>number</u>
              Increase volume count by <u>number</u>.

       <b>-d</b>     Turn on debugging.
