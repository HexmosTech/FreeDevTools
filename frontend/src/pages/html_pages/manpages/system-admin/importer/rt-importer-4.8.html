       rt-importer - Import a serialized RT database on top of the current one

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           rt-importer path/to/export/directory

       This script is used to import the contents of a dump created by "rt-serializer".  It will create all of
       the objects in the dump in the current database; this may include users, queues, and tickets.

       It is possible to stop the import process with ^C; it can be later resumed by re-running the importer.

       Certain records (notably queues and groups) will have their original Organization name prepended to them
       on import. This is primarily to avoid duplicate names (for example importing a General queue into an RT
       that already has one would otherwise cause a name collision error). If you are confident you won't have
       any name collisions in queues or groups, you may suppress this behavior by passing the
       <b>--exclude-organization</b> flag to "rt-importer".

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--list</b>
           Print a summary of the data contained in the dump.

       <b>--quiet</b>
           Suppresses  the  display  of  progress bars during an import.  This option is implied when the output
           isn't going directly to a terminal.

       <b>--originalid</b> <u>cfname</u>
           Places the original ticket organization and ID into a global custom field with the given name.  If no
           global ticket custom field with that name is found in the current database, it will create one.

       <b>--exclude-organization</b>
           Ordinarily certain records (groups, queues, the <b>--originalid</b> custom field) include  the  organization
           name of the original RT instance. Use this option to suppress that behavior and use the original name
           directly.

       <b>--ask</b>
           Prompt  for  action when an error occurs inserting a record into the database.  This can often happen
           when importing data from very old RTs where some attachments (usually spam) contain invalid UTF-8.

           The importer will pause and ask if you want to ignore the error and continue on or abort (potentially
           to restart later).  Ignoring errors will result in missing records in the database, which  may  cause
           database  integrity  problems  later.  If you ignored any errors, you should run "rt-validator" after
           import.

       <b>--ignore-errors</b>
           Ignore all record creation errors and continue on when importing.  This is equivalent to running with
           "--ask" and manually typing "ignore" at every prompt.  You should  always  run  "rt-validator"  after
           importing with errors ignored.

           <b>This</b> <b>option</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> <b>RT!</b>

       <b>--dump</b> <u>class</u>[,<u>class</u>]
           Prints  Data::Dumper  representations  of  the objects of type <u>class</u> in the serialized data.  This is
           mostly useful for debugging.

           Works only in conjunction with "--list".

       <b>--no-auto-commit</b>
           Don't auto commit to database. When this flag is used, it will commit only once for each  data  file.
           This could boost performance in some cases.

</pre><h4><b>CLONED</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       Some dumps may have been taken as complete clones of the RT system, which are only suitable for inserting
       into  a  schema  with  no  data  in  it.   You can setup the required database state for the receiving RT
       instance by running:

           /usr/sbin/rt-setup-database --action create,schema,acl --prompt-for-dba-password

       The normal "make initdb" step will <b>not</b> work because it also inserts core system data.
