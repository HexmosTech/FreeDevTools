</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       foremost - Recover files using their headers, footers, and data structures

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>foremost</b> [<b>-h</b>] [<b>-V</b>] [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-vqwQT</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>&lt;blocksize&gt;</u>] [<b>-o</b> <u>&lt;dir&gt;</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>&lt;num&gt;</u>] [<b>-i</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>]

</pre><h4><b>BUILTIN</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       Recover files from a disk image based on file types specified by the user using the -t switch.

       <b>jpg</b>    Support for the JFIF and Exif formats including implementations used in modern digital cameras.

       <b>gif</b>

       <b>png</b>

       <b>bmp</b>    Support for windows bmp format.

       <b>avi</b>

       <b>exe</b>    Support for Windows PE binaries, will extract DLL and EXE files along with their compile times.

       <b>mpg</b>    Support for most MPEG files (must begin with 0x000001BA)

       <b>wav</b>

       <b>riff</b>   This  will  extract  AVI  and  RIFF  since  they use the same file format (RIFF). note faster than
              running each separately.

       <b>wmv</b>    Note may also extract wma files as they have similar format.

       <b>mov</b>

       <b>pdf</b>

       <b>ole</b>    This will grab any file using the OLE file structure.   This  includes  PowerPoint,  Word,  Excel,
              Access, and StarWriter

       <b>doc</b>    Note  it  is  more efficient to run OLE as you get more bang for your buck.  If you wish to ignore
              all other ole files then use this.

       <b>zip</b>    Note is will extract .jar files as well because they use a similar format.  Open Office  docs  are
              just  zip'd  XML  files  so  they are extracted as well.  These include SXW, SXC, SXI, and SX? for
              undetermined OpenOffice files.  Office 2007 files are also XML based (PPTX,DOCX,XLSX)

       <b>rar</b>

       <b>htm</b>

       <b>cpp</b>    C source code detection, note this is primitive and may generate documents other than C code.

       <b>mp4</b>    Support for MP4 files.

       <b>all</b>    Run all pre-defined extraction methods. [Default if no -t is specified]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Recover files from a disk image based on headers and footers specified by the user.

       <b>-h</b>     Show a help screen and exit.

       <b>-V</b>     Show copyright information and exit.

       <b>-d</b>     Turn on indirect block detection, this works well for Unix file systems.

       <b>-T</b>     Time stamp the output directory so you don't have to delete the output dir when  running  multiple
              times.

       <b>-v</b>     Enables  verbose  mode. This causes more information regarding the current state of the program to
              be displayed on the screen, and is highly recommended.

       <b>-q</b>     Enables quick mode. In quick mode, only the start of each sector is searched for matching headers.
              That is, the header is searched only up to the length of the  longest  header.  The  rest  of  the
              sector, usually about 500 bytes, is ignored. This mode makes foremost run considerably faster, but
              it may cause you to miss files that are embedded in other files. For example, using quick mode you
              will not be able to find JPEG images embedded in Microsoft Word documents.

              Quick  mode  should  not  be  used when examining NTFS file systems. Because NTFS will store small
              files inside the Master File Table, these files will be missed during quick mode.

       <b>-Q</b>     Enables Quiet mode. Most error messages will be suppressed.

       <b>-w</b>     Enables write audit only mode.  No files will be extracted.

       <b>-a</b>     Enables write all headers, perform no error detection in terms of corrupted files.

       <b>-b</b> <u>number</u>
              Allows you to specify the block size used in foremost.  This is relevant for file naming and quick
              searches.  The default is 512.       ie.  foremost -b 1024 image.dd

       <b>-k</b> <u>number</u>
              Allows you to specify the chunk size used in foremost.  This can improve speed if you have  enough
              RAM  to  fit the image in.  It reduces the checking that occurs between chunks of the buffer.  For
              example if you had &gt; 500MB of RAM.       ie.  foremost -k 500 image.dd

       <b>-i</b> <u>file</u>
              The <u>file</u> is used as the input file.  If no input file is specified or the  input  file  cannot  be
              read then stdin is used.

       <b>-o</b> <u>directory</u>
              Recovered files are written to the directory <u>directory</u>.

       <b>-c</b> <u>file</u>
              Sets  the  configuration  file  to  use.  If  none is specified, the file "foremost.conf" from the
              current directory is used, if that doesn't exist then "/etc/foremost.conf" is used. The format for
              the configuration file is described in the default configuration file included with this  program.
              See the <u>CONFIGURATION</u> <u>FILE</u> section below for more information.

       <b>-s</b> <u>number</u>
              Skips <u>number</u> blocks in the input file before beginning the search for headers.       ie.  foremost
              -s 512 -t jpeg -i /dev/hda1

       <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b>
              The  configuration  file  is  used  to control what types of files foremost searches for. A sample
              configuration file, foremost.conf, is included with this distribution. For  each  file  type,  the
              configuration  file  describes  the  file's  extension,  whether  the  header  and footer are case
              sensitive, the maximum file size, and the header and footer for the  file.  The  footer  field  is
              optional, but header, size, case sensitivity, and extension are not!

              Any  line  that begins with a pound sign is considered a comment and ignored. Thus, to skip a file
              type just put a pound sign at the beginning of that line

              Headers and footers are decoded before use. To specify a value in  hexadecimal  use  \x[0-f][0-f],
              and  for  octal use \[0-7][0-7][0-7].  Spaces can be represented by \s. Example: "\x4F\123\I\sCCI"
              decodes to "OSI CCI".

              To match any single character (aka a wildcard) use a ?. If you need to search for the ? character,
              you will need to change the wildcard line *and* every occurrence of the old wildcard character  in
              the configuration file. Do not forget those hex and octal values! ? is equal to \x3f and \063.

              There is a sample set of headers in the README file.
