</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       privoxy - Privacy Enhancing Proxy

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>privoxy</b> [<b>--chroot</b> ] [<b>--config-test</b> ] [<b>--help</b> ] [<b>--no-daemon</b> ] [<b>--pidfile</b> <u>pidfile</u> ] [<b>--pre-chroot-nslookup</b>
       <u>hostname</u> ] [<b>--user</b> <u>user[.group]</u> ] [<b>--version</b> ] [<u>configfile</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Privoxy</b> may be invoked with the following command line options:

       <b>--chroot</b>
              Before  changing  to the user ID given in the --user option, chroot to that user's home directory,
              i.e. make the kernel pretend to the <b>Privoxy</b> process that the directory tree starts there.  If  set
              up  carefully,  this  can  limit  the  impact  of possible vulnerabilities in <b>Privoxy</b> to the files
              contained in that hierarchy.

       <b>--config-test</b>
              Exit after loading the configuration files before binding to the listen  address.  The  exit  code
              signals whether or not the configuration files have been successfully loaded.

              If  the  exit  code  is 1, at least one of the configuration files is invalid, if it is 0, all the
              configuration files have been successfully loaded (but may still contain errors that can currently
              only be detected at run time).

              This option doesn't affect the log setting, combination with "--no-daemon"  is  recommended  if  a
              configured log file shouldn't be used.

       <b>--help</b> Print brief usage info and exit.

       <b>--no-daemon</b>
              Don't   become   a  daemon,  i.e.  don't  fork  and become process group leader, don't detach from
              controlling tty, and do all logging there.

       <b>--pidfile</b> <u>pidfile</u>
              On startup, write the process ID to <u>pidfile</u>.  Delete the <u>pidfile</u> on exit.  Failure  to  create  or
              delete the <u>pidfile</u> is non-fatal. If no <b>--pidfile</b> option is given, no PID file will be used.

       <b>--pre-chroot-nslookup</b> <u>hostname</u>
              Initialize the resolver library using <u>hostname</u> before chroot'ing. On some systems this reduces the
              number of files that must be copied into the chroot tree.

       <b>--user</b> <u>user[.group]</u>
              After  (optionally)  writing the PID file, assume the user ID of <u>user</u> and the GID of <u>group</u>, or, if
              the optional <u>group</u> was not given, the default group of  <u>user</u>.  Exit  if  the  privileges  are  not
              sufficient to do so.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print version info and exit.

       If the <u>configfile</u> is not specified on  the  command  line, <b>Privoxy</b>  will  look for a file named <u>config</u> in
       the current directory. If no <u>configfile</u> is found, <b>Privoxy</b> will fail to start.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Privoxy  is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for enhancing privacy, modifying
       web page data and HTTP headers, controlling access, and removing ads and other obnoxious  Internet  junk.
       Privoxy  has  a flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and tastes.  It has
       application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user networks.

       Privoxy is Free Software and licensed under the GNU GPLv2 or later.

       Privoxy is an associated project of Software in the Public Interest (SPI).

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Browsers can either be individually configured to use <b>Privoxy</b> as a HTTP proxy (recommended),  or  <b>Privoxy</b>
       can be combined with a packet filter to build an intercepting proxy (see <u>config</u>).  The default setting is
       for  localhost,  on port  8118 (configurable in the main config file).  To set the HTTP proxy in Firefox,
       go through: <b>Tools</b>; <b>Options</b>; <b>General</b>; <b>Connection</b> <b>Settings</b>; <b>Manual</b> <b>Proxy</b> <b>Configuration</b>.

       For Internet Explorer, go through: <b>Tools</b>; <b>Internet</b> <b>Properties</b>; <b>Connections</b>; <b>LAN</b> <b>Settings</b>.

       The Secure (SSL) Proxy should also be set to the same values, otherwise https: URLs will not be  proxied.
       Note:  <b>Privoxy</b>  can  only proxy HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Do not try it with FTP or other protocols.  HTTPS
       presents some limitations, and not all features will work with HTTPS connections.

       For other browsers, check the documentation.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Privoxy</b> can be configured with the various configuration files.  The  default  configuration  files  are:
       <u>config</u>, <u>default.filter</u>, <u>default.action</u> and <u>default.action</u>. <u>user.action</u> should be used for locally defined
       exceptions  to  the  default  rules  in  <u>match-all.action</u> and <u>default.action</u>, and <u>user.filter</u> for locally
       defined filters. These are well  commented.   On  Unix  and  Unix-like  systems,  these  are  located  in
       <u>/etc/privoxy/</u> by default.

       <b>Privoxy</b> uses the concept of <b>actions</b> in order to manipulate the data stream between the browser and remote
       sites.   There  are  various  actions  available  with specific functions for such things as blocking web
       sites, managing cookies, etc. These actions can be invoked individually or  combined,  and  used  against
       individual  URLs,  or  groups  of  URLs  that can be defined using wildcards and regular expressions. The
       result is that the user has greatly enhanced control and freedom.

       The  actions  list  (ad  blocks,   etc)   can   also   be   configured   with   your   web   browser   at
       <a href="http://config.privoxy.org/">http://config.privoxy.org/</a>  (assuming  the  configuration allows it).  <b>Privoxy's</b> configuration parameters
       can also  be viewed at the same page. In addition, <b>Privoxy</b> can be toggled on/off.  This  is  an  internal
       page, and does not require Internet access.

       See the <u>User</u> <u>Manual</u> for a detailed explanation of installation, general usage, all configuration options,
       new features and notes on upgrading.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
        <u>/usr/sbin/privoxy</u>
        <u>/etc/privoxy/config</u>
        <u>/etc/privoxy/match-all.action</u>
        <u>/etc/privoxy/default.action</u>
        <u>/etc/privoxy/user.action</u>
        <u>/etc/privoxy/default.filter</u>
        <u>/etc/privoxy/user.filter</u>
        <u>/etc/privoxy/trust</u>
        <u>/etc/privoxy/templates/*</u>
        <u>/var/log/privoxy/logfile</u>

       Various  other  files  should  be  included,  but may vary depending on platform and build configuration.
       Additional documentation should be included in the local documentation directory.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Privoxy</b> terminates on the <b>SIGINT</b> and <b>SIGTERM</b> signals. Log rotation scripts may cause a re-opening of  the
       logfile by sending a <b>SIGHUP</b> to <b>Privoxy</b>. Note that unlike other daemons,  <b>Privoxy</b> does not need to be made
       aware  of config file changes by <b>SIGHUP</b> -- it will detect them automatically. Signals other than the ones
       listed above aren't explicitly handled and result in the default action defined by the operating system.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>

       and other questions.
