</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PyGopherd - Multiprotocol Information Server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pygopherd</b> [ <u>configfile</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Welcome  to  <b>PyGopherd</b>.   In  a  nutshell,  <b>PyGopherd</b>  is  a  modern  dynamic multi-protocol hierarchical
       information server with a pluggable modularized extension system, full flexible  caching,  virtual  files
       and  folders,  and  autodetection  of file types -- all with support for standardized yet extensible per-
       document metadata. Whew! Read on for information on this what all these buzzwords mean.

</pre><h4><b>QUICK</b> <b>START</b></h4><pre>
       If you have already installed <b>PyGopherd</b> system-wide, or your administrator has done that  for  you,  your
       task  for  setting  up  <b>PyGopherd</b>  for  the  first  time  is  quite simple.  You just need to set up your
       configuration file, make your folder directory, and run it!

       You can quickly set up your configuration  file.   The  distribution  includes  two  files  of  interest:
       <u>conf/pygopherd.conf</u>  and <u>conf/mime.types</u>.  Debian users will find the configuration file pre-installed in
       <u>/etc/pygopherd/pygopherd.conf</u> and the <u>mime.types</u> file provided by the system already.

       Open up <u>pygopherd.conf</u> in your editor and adjust to suit.  The file is  heavily  commented  and  you  can
       refer  to  it  for detailed information.  Some settings to take a look at include: <u>detach</u>, <u>pidfile</u>, <u>port</u>,
       <u>usechroot</u>, <u>setuid</u>, <u>setgid</u>, and <u>root</u>.  These may or may not work at their defaults for you.  The remaining
       ones should be fine for a basic setup.

       Invoke <b>PyGopherd</b> with <b>pygopherd</b> <b>path/to/configfile</b> (or <b>/etc/init.d/pygopherd</b>  <b>start</b>  on  Debian).   Place
       some files in the location specified by the <u>root</u> directive in the config file and you're ready to run!

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All  <b>PyGopherd</b>  configuratoin  is  done  via the configuration file.  Therefore, the program has only one
       command-line option:

       <u>configfile</u>
              This option argument specifies the location of the configuration file that <b>PyGopherd</b> is to use.
