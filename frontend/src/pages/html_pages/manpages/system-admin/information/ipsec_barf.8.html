</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ipsec_barf - spew out collected IPsec debugging information

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>ipsec</b> <u>barf</u> [--short]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Barf</u> outputs (on standard output) a collection of debugging information (contents of files, selections
       from logs, etc.) related to the IPsec encryption/authentication system. It is primarily a convenience for
       remote debugging, a single command that packages up (and labels) all information that might be relevant
       to diagnosing a problem in IPsec.

       The <b>--short</b> option limits the length of the log portion of <u>barf</u>'s output, which can otherwise be
       extremely voluminous if debug logging is turned on.

       On systems with systemd, ipsec barf will look for logs using the journalctl command. If the logfile=
       option is used, logs will also not be found by the ipsec barf command.

       <u>Barf</u> censors its output, replacing keys and secrets with brief checksums to avoid revealing sensitive
       information.

       Beware that the output of both commands is aimed at humans, not programs, and the output format is
       subject to change without warning.

       <u>Barf</u> has to figure out which files in <a href="file:/var/log">/var/log</a> contain the IPsec log messages. It looks for general log
       messages first in <u>messages</u> and <u>syslog</u>, and for Pluto messages first in <u>secure</u>, <u>auth.log</u>, and <u>debug</u>. In
       both cases, if it does not find what it is looking for in one of those “likely” places, it will resort to
       a brute-force search of most (non-compressed) files in /var/log.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
           <a href="file:/proc/net/">/proc/net/</a>*
           <a href="file:/var/log/">/var/log/</a>*
           /etc/ipsec.conf
           /etc/ipsec.secrets

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Written for the Linux FreeS/WAN project &lt;<b>https://www.freeswan.org</b>&gt; by Henry Spencer.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Barf</u> uses heuristics to try to pick relevant material out of the logs, and relevant messages that are not
       labelled with any of the tags that <u>barf</u> looks for will be lost. We think we've eliminated the last such
       case, but one never knows...

       Finding <u>updown</u> scripts (so they can be included in output) is, in general, difficult.  <u>Barf</u> uses a very
       simple heuristic that is easily fooled.

       The brute-force search for the right log files can get expensive on systems with a lot of clutter in
       /var/log.
