       wpa_background - Background information on Wi-Fi Protected Access and IEEE 802.11i

</pre><h4><b>WPA</b></h4><pre>
       The  original  security mechanism of IEEE 802.11 standard was not designed to be strong and has proven to
       be insufficient for most networks that require some kind of security. Task group  I  (Security)  of  IEEE
       802.11  working  group  (<a href="http://www.ieee802.org/11/">http://www.ieee802.org/11/</a>) has worked to address the flaws of the base standard
       and has in practice completed its work in May 2004.  The  IEEE  802.11i  amendment  to  the  IEEE  802.11
       standard was approved in June 2004 and published in July 2004.

       Wi-Fi  Alliance  (<a href="http://www.wi-fi.org/">http://www.wi-fi.org/</a>)  used  a  draft  version of the IEEE 802.11i work (draft 3.0) to
       define a subset of the security enhancements that can be implemented with existing wlan hardware. This is
       called Wi-Fi Protected Access&lt;TM&gt; (WPA). This has now become a mandatory  component  of  interoperability
       testing  and  certification  done by Wi-Fi Alliance. Wi-Fi provides information about WPA at its web site
       (<a href="http://www.wi-fi.org/OpenSection/protected_access.asp">http://www.wi-fi.org/OpenSection/protected_access.asp</a>).

       IEEE 802.11 standard defined wired equivalent privacy (WEP) algorithm for protecting  wireless  networks.
       WEP  uses  RC4  with  40-bit keys, 24-bit initialization vector (IV), and CRC32 to protect against packet
       forgery. All these choices have proven to be  insufficient:  key  space  is  too  small  against  current
       attacks,  RC4 key scheduling is insufficient (beginning of the pseudorandom stream should be skipped), IV
       space is too small and IV reuse makes attacks easier,  there  is  no  replay  protection,  and  non-keyed
       authentication does not protect against bit flipping packet data.

       WPA  is  an intermediate solution for the security issues. It uses Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)
       to replace WEP. TKIP is a compromise on strong security and possibility  to  use  existing  hardware.  It
       still  uses  RC4  for  the  encryption like WEP, but with per-packet RC4 keys. In addition, it implements
       replay protection, keyed packet authentication mechanism (Michael MIC).

       Keys can be managed using two different mechanisms. WPA can either use an external authentication  server
       (e.g.,  RADIUS)  and  EAP  just  like IEEE 802.1X is using or pre-shared keys without need for additional
       servers. Wi-Fi calls these  "WPA-Enterprise"  and  "WPA-Personal",  respectively.  Both  mechanisms  will
       generate a master session key for the Authenticator (AP) and Supplicant (client station).

       WPA  implements  a  new  key  handshake  (4-Way  Handshake  and  Group  Key Handshake) for generating and
       exchanging data encryption keys between the Authenticator and Supplicant. This handshake is also used  to
       verify that both Authenticator and Supplicant know the master session key. These handshakes are identical
       regardless  of  the  selected key management mechanism (only the method for generating master session key
       changes).

       The design for parts of IEEE 802.11i that were not included in WPA  has  finished  (May  2004)  and  this
       amendment  to  IEEE 802.11 was approved in June 2004. Wi-Fi Alliance is using the final IEEE 802.11i as a
       new version of WPA called WPA2. This includes, e.g., support for more robust encryption algorithm  (CCMP:
       AES  in  Counter  mode  with  CBC-MAC)  to  replace TKIP and optimizations for handoff (reduced number of
       messages in initial key handshake, pre-authentication, and PMKSA caching).
