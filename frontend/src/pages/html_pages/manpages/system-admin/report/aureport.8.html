</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       aureport - a tool that produces summary reports of audit daemon logs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>aureport</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>aureport</b>  is a tool that produces summary reports of the audit system logs. The aureport utility can also
       take input from stdin as long as the input is the raw log data. The reports have a column  label  at  the
       top  to  help  with interpretation of the various fields. Except for the main summary report, all reports
       have the audit event number. You can subsequently lookup the full event with ausearch  <b>-a</b>  <u>event</u>  <u>number</u>.
       You may need to specify start &amp; stop times if you get multiple hits. The reports produced by aureport can
       be used as building blocks for more complicated analysis.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-au</b>, <b>--auth</b>
              Report about authentication attempts

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--avc</b>
              Report about avc messages

       <b>--comm</b> Report about commands run

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--config</b>
              Report about config changes

       <b>-cr</b>, <b>--crypto</b>
              Report about crypto events

       <b>--debug</b>
              Write malformed events that are skipped to stderr.

       <b>--eoe-timeout</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Set the end of event parsing timeout. See <b>end_of_event_timeout</b> in <u><a href="../man5/auditd.conf.5.html">auditd.conf</a>(5)</u> for details. Note
              that setting this value will override any configured value found in /etc/auditd/auditd.conf.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--event</b>
              Report about events

       <b>--escape</b> <u>option</u>
              This  option  determines  if the output is escaped to make the content safer for certain uses. The
              options are <u>raw</u> , <u>tty</u> , <u>shell</u> ,  and  <u>shell_quote</u>.  Each  mode  includes  the  characters  of  the
              preceding  mode  and escapes more characters. That is to say <u>shell</u> includes all characters escaped
              by <u>tty</u> and adds more. <u>tty</u> is the default.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--file</b>
              Report about files and af_unix sockets

       <b>--failed</b>
              Only select failed events for processing in the reports. The default is both  success  and  failed
              events.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--host</b>
              Report about hosts

       <b>--help</b> Print brief command summary

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--interpret</b>
              Interpret   numeric   entities  into  text.  For  example,  uid  is converted to account name. The
              conversion is done using the current resources  of  the machine where the search is being run.  If
              you  have  renamed the accounts, or don't have the  same  accounts  on your machine, you could get
              misleading results.

       <b>-if</b>, <b>--input</b> <u>file</u> | <u>directory</u>
              Use the given <u>file</u> or <u>directory</u> instead of the logs. This is to aid analysis where the  logs  have
              been  moved to another machine or only part of a log was saved. The path length is limited to 4064
              bytes.

       <b>--input-logs</b>
              Use the log file location from auditd.conf as input for analysis. This is needed if you are  using
              aureport from a cron job.

       <b>--integrity</b>
              Report about integrity events

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--key</b>
              Report about audit rule keys

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--login</b>
              Report about logins

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mods</b>
              Report about account modifications

       <b>-ma</b>, <b>--mac</b>
              Report about Mandatory Access Control (MAC) events

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--anomaly</b>
              Report  about  anomaly  events.  These events include NIC going into promiscuous mode and programs
              segfaulting.

       <b>--node</b> <u>node-name</u>
              Only select events originating from <u>node</u> <u>name</u> string for processing in the reports. The default is
              to include all nodes. Multiple nodes are allowed.

       <b>-nc</b>, <b>--no-config</b>
              Do not include the CONFIG_CHANGE event. This is particularly useful for  the  key  report  because
              audit rules have key labels in many cases. Using this option gets rid of these false positives.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pid</b>
              Report about processes

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--response</b>
              Report about responses to anomaly events

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--syscall</b>
              Report about syscalls

       <b>--success</b>
              Only  select  successful  events  for  processing  in the reports. The default is both success and
              failed events.

       <b>--summary</b>
              Run the summary report that gives a total of the elements of the main report. Not all reports have
              a summary.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--log</b>
              This option will output a report of the start and end times for each log.

       <b>--tty</b>  Report about tty keystrokes

       <b>-te</b>, <b>--end</b> [<u>end-date</u>] [<u>end-time</u>]
              Search for events with time stamps equal to or before the given end time. The format of  end  time
              depends  on  your locale. If the date is omitted, <b>today</b> is assumed. If the time is omitted, <b>now</b> is
              assumed. Use 24 hour clock time rather than AM or PM to specify time. An example  date  using  the
              en_US.utf8  locale  is  09/03/2009.  An  example  of time is 18:00:00. The date format accepted is
              influenced by the LC_TIME environmental variable.

              You may also use the word: <b>now</b>, <b>recent</b>, <b>this-hour</b>, <b>boot</b>, <b>today</b>,  <b>yesterday</b>,  <b>this-week</b>,  <b>week-ago</b>,
              <b>this-month</b>,  <b>this-year</b>.  <b>Now</b>  means starting now. <b>Recent</b> is 10 minutes ago. <b>Boot</b> means the time of
              day to the second when the system last booted. <b>Today</b>  means  now.  <b>Yesterday</b>  is  1  second  after
              midnight  the  previous day. <b>This-week</b> means starting 1 second after midnight on day 0 of the week
              determined by your locale (see <b>localtime</b>). <b>Week-ago</b> means 1 second after midnight exactly  7  days
              ago.  <b>This-month</b> means 1 second after midnight on day 1 of the month. <b>This-year</b> means the 1 second
              after midnight on the first day of the first month.

       <b>-tm</b>, <b>--terminal</b>
              Report about terminals

       <b>-ts</b>, <b>--start</b> [<u>start-date</u>] [<u>start-time</u>]
              Search for events with time stamps equal to or after the given end time. The format  of  end  time
              depends on your locale. If the date is omitted, <b>today</b> is assumed. If the time is omitted, <b>midnight</b>
              is assumed. Use 24 hour clock time rather than AM or PM to specify time. An example date using the
              en_US.utf8  locale  is  09/03/2009.  An  example  of time is 18:00:00. The date format accepted is
              influenced by the LC_TIME environmental variable.

              You may also use the word: <b>now</b>, <b>recent</b>, <b>this-hour</b>, <b>boot</b>, <b>today</b>,  <b>yesterday</b>,  <b>this-week</b>,  <b>week-ago</b>,
              <b>this-month</b>, <b>this-year</b>. <b>Boot</b> means the time of day to the second when the system last booted. <b>Today</b>
              means  starting  at 1 second after midnight. <b>Recent</b> is 10 minutes ago. <b>Yesterday</b> is 1 second after
              midnight the previous day. <b>This-week</b> means starting 1 second after midnight on day 0 of  the  week
              determined by your locale (see <b>localtime</b>). <b>Week-ago</b> means starting 1 second after midnight exactly
              7  days ago. <b>This-month</b> means 1 second after midnight on day 1 of the month. <b>This-year</b> means the 1
              second after midnight on the first day of the first month.

              Report about users

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print the version and exit

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--executable</b>
              Report about executables

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       The boot time option is a convenience function and has limitations. The time it calculates  is  based  on
       time  now  minus /proc/uptime. If after boot the system clock has been adjusted, perhaps by ntp, then the
       calculation may be wrong. In that case you'll need to fully specify the time. You can check the  time  it
       would use by running:

       date -d "`cut -f1 -d. <a href="file:/proc/uptime">/proc/uptime</a>` seconds ago"
