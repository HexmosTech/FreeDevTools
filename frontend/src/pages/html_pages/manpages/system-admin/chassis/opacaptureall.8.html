       opacaptureall

       <b>(Chassis</b>  <b>and</b> <b>Host)</b> Captures supporting information for a problem report from all hosts or Intel(R) Omni-
       Path Chassis and uploads to this system.

       <b>For</b> <b>Hosts:</b> When a host opacaptureall is performed, opacapture is run to create the specified capture file
       within ~root on each host (with the .tgz suffix added as needed). The files  are  uploaded  and  unpacked
       into  a matching directory name within upload_dir/<u>hostname</u>/ on the local system. The default file name is
       hostcapture.

       <b>For</b> <b>Chassis:</b> When a chassis opacaptureall is performed, opacapture is run on each chassis and its  output
       is saved to upload_dir/<u>chassisname</u>/<u>file</u> on the local system. The default file name is chassiscapture.

       For both host and chassis capture, the uploaded captures are combined into a .tgz file with the file name
       specified and the suffix .all.tgz added.

</pre><h4><b>Syntax</b></h4><pre>
       opacaptureall [-C] [-p] [-f  <u>hostfile</u>] [-F  <u>chassisfile</u>] [-h '<u>hosts</u>']

       [-H '<u>chassis</u>'] [-t  <u>portsfile</u>] [-d  <u>upload_dir</u>] [-S] [-D  <u>detail_level</u>]

       [ <u>file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       --help

                 Produces full help text.

       -C

                 Performs capture against chassis. Default is hosts.

       -p

                 Performs  capture upload in parallel on all host/chassis. For a host capture, this only affects
                 the upload phase.

       -f <u>hostfile</u>

                 Specifies the file with hosts in cluster. Default is /etc/opa/hosts file.

       -F <u>chassisfile</u>

                 Specifies the file containing a list of chassis in the  cluster.  Default  is  /etc/opa/chassis
                 file.

       -h <u>hosts</u>

                 Specifies the list of hosts on which to perform a capture.

       -H <u>chassis</u>

                 Specifies the list of chassis on which to perform a capture.

       -t <u>portsfile</u>

                 Specifies  the  file  with  list of local HFI ports used to access fabric(s) for switch access.
                 Default is /etc/opa/ports file.

       -d <u>upload_dir</u>

                 Specifies the directory to upload to. Default is uploads. If  not  specified,  the  environment
                 variable <b>UPLOADS_DIR</b> is used. If that is not exported, the default ./uploads is used.

       -S

                 Securely prompts for password for administrator on a chassis.

       -D <u>detail_level</u>

                 Specifies  the  level  of  detail of the capture passed to host opacapture. (Only used for host
                 captures; ignored for chassis captures.)

                 1 (Local) Obtains local information from each host.

                 2 (Fabric)
                           In addition to <u>Local</u>, also obtains basic fabric information by queries to the SM  and
                           fabric error analysis using opareport.

                 3 (Fabric+FDB)
                           In addition to <u>Fabric</u>, also obtains the Forwarding Database (FDB), which includes the
                           switch forwarding tables from the SM.

                 4 (Analysis)
                           In addition to <u>Fabric+FDB</u>, also obtains opaallanalysis results. If opaallanalysis has
                           not yet been run, it is run as part of the capture.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
              Detail  levels  2-4  can  be  used when fabric operational problems occur. If the problem is node-
              specific, detail level 1 should be sufficient. Detail levels 2-4 require an  operational  Intel(R)
              Omni-Path  Fabric  Suite  Fabric  Manager.  Typically your support representative requests a given
              detail level. If a given detail level takes excessively long or fails to be gathered, try a  lower
              detail level.

       For  detail levels 2-4, the additional information is only gathered on the node running the opacaptureall
       command. The information is gathered for every fabric specified in the /etc/opa/ports file.

       <u>file</u>

                 Specifies the name for capture file. The suffix .tgz is appended if it is not specified in  the
                 name.

</pre><h4><b>Examples</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>Host</b> <b>Capture</b> <b>Examples</b></h4><pre>
       opacaptureall

       # Creates a hostcapture directory in upload_dir/hostname/ for each host
       in /etc/opa/hosts file, then creates hostcapture.all.tgz.

       opacaptureall mycapture

       # Creates a mycapture directory in upload_dir/hostname/ for each host
       in /etc/opa/hosts file, then creates mycapture.all.tgz.

       opacaptureall -h 'arwen elrond' 030127capture

       # Gets the list of hosts from arwen elrond file and creates
       030127capture.tgz file.

</pre><h4><b>Chassis</b> <b>Capture</b> <b>Examples</b></h4><pre>
       opacaptureall -C

       # Creates a chassiscapture file in upload_dir/chassisname/ for each
       chassis in /etc/opa/chassis file, then creates chassiscapture.all.tgz.

       opacaptureall -C mycapture

       # Creates a mycapture.tgz file in upload_dir/chassisname/ for each
       chassis in /etc/opa/chassis file, then creates mycapture.all.tgz.

       opacaptureall -C -H 'chassis1 chassis2' 030127capture

       # Captures from chassis1 and chassis2, and creates 030127capture.tgz file.

</pre><h4><b>Environment</b> <b>Variables</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables are also used by this command:

       <b>HOSTS</b>

                 List of hosts, used if -h option not supplied.

       <b>CHASSIS</b>

                 List of chassis, used if -C is used and -h option is not supplied.

       <b>HOSTS_FILE</b>

                 File containing a list of hosts, used in the absence of -f and -h.

       <b>CHASSIS_FILE</b>

                 File containing a list of chassis, used in the absence of -F and -H.

       <b>UPLOADS_DIR</b>

                 Directory to upload to, used in the absence of -d.

       <b>FF_MAX_PARALLEL</b>

                 When -p option is used, maximum concurrent operations are performed.

       <b>FF_CHASSIS_LOGIN_METHOD</b>

                 How to log into chassis. Can be Telnet or SSH.

       <b>FF_CHASSIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD</b>

                 Password for administrator on all chassis. Used in absence of -S option.

</pre><h4><b>More</b> <b>Information</b></h4><pre>
       When  performing  opacaptureall against hosts, internally SSH is used. The command opacaptureall requires
       that password-less SSH be set up between the host running  Intel(R)  Omni-Path  Fabric  Suite  FastFabric
       Toolset  and  the hosts opacaptureall is operating against. The opasetupssh command can aid in setting up
       password-less SSH.

       When performing operations against chassis, Intel recommends that you set up SSH keys using  opasetupssh.
       If  SSH keys are not set up, Intel recommends that all chassis be configured with the same admin password
       and that you use of the -S option to avoid keeping the password in configuration files.

       <b>NOTE:</b> The resulting host capture files can require significant amounts of space on the Intel(R) Omni-Path
       Fabric Suite FastFabric Toolset host. Actual size varies, but sizes can be multiple megabytes  per  host.
       Intel  recommends  that  you  ensure  adequate  space is available on the Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric Suite
       FastFabric Toolset system. In many cases, it may not be necessary to run opacaptureall against all  hosts
       or  chassis; instead, a representative subset may be sufficient. Consult with your support representative
       for further information.
