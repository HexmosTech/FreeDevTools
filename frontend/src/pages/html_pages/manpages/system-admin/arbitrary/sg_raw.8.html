       sg_raw - send arbitrary SCSI or NVMe command to a device

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sg_raw</b>  [<u>--binary</u>]  [<u>--cmdfile=CF</u>]  [<u>--cmdset=CS</u>]  [<u>--enumerate</u>]  [<u>--help</u>]  [<u>--infile=IFILE</u>]  [<u>--nosense</u>]
       [<u>--nvm</u>]   [<u>--outfile=OFILE</u>]   [<u>--raw</u>]   [<u>--readonly</u>]   [<u>--request=RLEN</u>]   [<u>--scan=FO,LO</u>]    [<u>--send=SLEN</u>]
       [<u>--skip=KLEN</u>] [<u>--timeout=SECS</u>] [<u>--verbose</u>] [<u>--version</u>] <u>DEVICE</u> [CDB0 CDB1 ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  utility  sends  an  arbitrary SCSI command (between 6 and 256 bytes) to the <u>DEVICE</u>. There may be no
       associated data transfer; or data may be read from a file and sent to the <u>DEVICE</u>; or data may be received
       from the <u>DEVICE</u> and then displayed or written to a file. If supported by the pass through,  bidirectional
       commands may be sent (i.e. containing both data to be sent to the <u>DEVICE</u> and received from the <u>DEVICE</u>).

       The  SCSI command may be between 6 and 256 bytes long. Each command byte is specified in plain hex format
       (00..FF) without a prefix or suffix. The command can be given either on  the  command  line  or  via  the
       <u>--cmdfile=CF</u> option. See EXAMPLES section below.

       The  commands  pass  through  a generic SCSI interface which is implemented for several operating systems
       including Linux, FreeBSD and Windows.

       Experimental support has been added to send NVMe Admin and NVM commands to the  <u>DEVICE</u>.  Since  all  NVMe
       commands  are  64 bytes long it is more convenient to use the <u>--cmdfile=CF</u> option rather than type the 64
       bytes of the NVMe command on the command line. See the section  on  NVME  below.  A  heuristic  based  on
       command length is used to decide if the given command is SCSI or NVMe, to override this heuristic use the
       <u>--cmdset=CS</u> option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments  to  long  options  are  mandatory  for  short  options  as  well.  The options are arranged in
       alphabetical order based on the long option name.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--binary</b>
              Dump data in binary form, even when writing to stdout.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--cmdfile</b>=<u>CF</u>
              <u>CF</u> is the name of a file which contains the command to  be  executed.   Without  this  option  the
              command must be given on the command line, after the options and the <u>DEVICE</u>.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--cmdset</b>=<u>CS</u>
              <u>CS</u>  is a number to indicate which command set (i.e. SCSI or NVMe) to use. 0, the default, causes a
              heuristic based on command length to be used. Use a <u>CS</u> of 1 to override that heuristic and  choose
              the SCSI command set. Use a <u>CS</u> of 2 to override that heuristic and choose the NVMe command set.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display usage information and exit.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--infile</b>=<u>IFILE</u>
              Read  binary  data from <u>IFILE</u> instead of stdin. This option is ignored if <b>--send</b> is not specified.
              That data, if used, will become the command's "data-out" buffer.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--nosense</b>
              Don't display SCSI Sense information.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--nvm</b>
              When sending NVMe commands, the Admin command set is assumed. To send the NVM  command  set  (e.g.
              the Read and Write (user data) commands) this option needs to be given.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--outfile</b>=<u>OFILE</u>
              Write  data  received  from  the <u>DEVICE</u> to <u>OFILE</u>. That data is the command's "data-in" buffer. The
              data is written in binary. By default, data is dumped in hex format to stdout.  If  <u>OFILE</u>  is  '-'
              then data is dumped in binary to stdout.  This option is ignored if <u>--request</u> is not specified.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--raw</b>
              interpret  <u>CF</u>  (i.e.  the  command  file)  as  containing binary. The default is to assume that it
              contains ASCII hexadecimal.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--readonly</b>
              Open <u>DEVICE</u> read-only. The default (without this option) is to open it read-write.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--request</b>=<u>RLEN</u>
              Expect to receive up to <u>RLEN</u> bytes of data from the <u>DEVICE</u>.  <u>RLEN</u> may be suffixed with 'k' to  use
              kilobytes  (1024  bytes)  instead  of  bytes.  <u>RLEN</u>  is  decimal unless it has a leading '0x' or a
              trailing 'h'.
              If <u>RLEN</u> is too small (i.e. either smaller than indicated by the  cdb  (typically  the  "allocation
              length"  field)  and/or  smaller  than  the  <u>DEVICE</u>  tries  to  send back) then the HBA driver may
              complain. Making <u>RLEN</u> larger than required should cause no problems. Most SCSI "data-in"  commands
              return  a  data  block that contains (in its early bytes) a length that the <u>DEVICE</u> would "like" to
              send back if the "allocation length" field in the cdb is large enough.  In  practice,  the  <u>DEVICE</u>
              will return no more bytes than indicated in the "allocation length" field of the cdb.

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--scan</b>=<u>FO</u>,<u>LO</u>
              Scan  a  range  of  opcodes  (i.e. first byte of each command). The first opcode in the scan is <u>FO</u>
              (which is decimal unless it has a '0x' prefix or 'h' suffix). The last opcode in the scan  is  <u>LO</u>.
              The  maximum  value  of <u>LO</u> is 255. The remaining bytes of the SCSI/NVMe command are as supplied at
              invocation.
              Warning: this option can be <b>dangerous.</b>  Sending somewhat arbitrary commands to a device  can  have
              unexpected  results.  It is recommended that this option is used with the <u>--cmdset=CS</u> option where
              <u>CS</u> is 1 or 2 in order to stop the command set possibly changing during the scan.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--send</b>=<u>SLEN</u>
              Read <u>SLEN</u> bytes of data, either from stdin or from a file, and send them to  the  <u>DEVICE</u>.  In  the
              SCSI  transport,  <u>SLEN</u>  becomes  the  length  (in bytes) of the "data-out" buffer. <u>SLEN</u> is decimal
              unless it has a leading '0x' or a trailing 'h'.
              It is the responsibility of the user to make sure that the "data-out" length implied or stated  in
              the  cdb  matches  <u>SLEN</u>.  Note  that  some common SCSI commands such as <a href="../man10/WRITE.10.html">WRITE</a>(10) have a "transfer
              length" field whose units are logical blocks (which are usually 512 or 4096 bytes long).

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--skip</b>=<u>KLEN</u>
              Skip the first <u>KLEN</u> bytes of the input file or stream. This option is ignored  if  <u>--send</u>  is  not
              specified. If <u>--send</u> is given and this option is not given, then zero bytes are skipped.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--timeout</b>=<u>SECS</u>
              Wait up to <u>SECS</u> seconds for command completion (default: 20). Note that if a command times out the
              operating  system  may start by aborting the command and if that is unsuccessful it may attempt to
              reset the device. An alternate long option form is <u>--tmo=SECS</u>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Increase level of verbosity. Can be used multiple times.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version and license information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The sg_inq utility can be used to send an INQUIRY command to a device to determine its peripheral  device
       type  (e.g.  '1'  for  a streaming device (tape drive)) which determines which SCSI command sets a device
       should support (e.g. SPC and SSC). The sg_vpd utility reads and decodes a device's  Vital  Product  Pages
       which may contain useful information.

       The  ability  to  send  more  than  a  16  byte  CDB (in some cases 12 byte CDB) may be restricted by the
       pass-through interface, the low level driver or the transport. In the Linux series  3  kernels,  the  bsg
       driver  can  handle longer CDBs, block devices (e.g. /dev/sdc) accessed via the SG_IO ioctl cannot handle
       CDBs longer than 16 bytes, and the sg driver can handle longer CDBs from lk 3.17 .

       The CDB command name defined by T10 for the given CDB is shown if the '-vv' option is given. The  command
       line syntax still needs to be correct, so /dev/null may be used for the <u>DEVICE</u> since the CDB command name
       decoding is done before the <u>DEVICE</u> is checked.

       The  intention  of  the  <u>--scan=FO,LO</u>  option  is  to  slightly simplify the process of finding hidden or
       undocumented commands. It should be used with  care;  for  example  checking  for  vendor  specific  SCSI
       commands: 'sg_raw --cmdset=1 --scan=0xc0,0xff /dev/sg1 0 0 0 0 0 0'.

</pre><h4><b>NVME</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Support for NVMe (a.k.a. NVM Express) is currently experimental. NVMe concepts map reasonably well to the
       SCSI architecture. A SCSI logical unit (LU) is similar to a NVMe namespace (although LUN 0 is very common
       in  SCSI  while  namespace  IDs  start  at 1). A SCSI target device is similar to a NVMe controller. SCSI
       commands vary from 6 to 260 bytes long (although SCSI command descriptor blocks (cdb_s)  longer  than  32
       bytes  are  uncommon)  while all NVMe commands are currently 64 bytes long. The SCSI architecture makes a
       clear distinction between an initiator (often called a HBA) and a target (device) while (at least on  the
       PCIe  transport)  the  NVMe  controller  plays  both  roles.   This utility defaults to assuming the user
       provided 64 byte command belongs to NVMe's Admin command set. To issue commands from  the  "NVM"  command
       set, the <u>--nvm</u> option must be given. Admin and NVM commands are sent to submission queue 0.

       One  significant  difference  is  that SCSI uses a big endian representation for integers that are longer
       than 8 bits (i.e. longer than 1 byte) while NVMe uses a little endian representation  (like  most  things
       that have originated from the Intel organisation). NVMe specifications talk about Words (16 bits), Double
       Words (32 bits) and sometimes Quad Words (64 bits) and has tighter alignment requirements than SCSI.

       One  difference  that  impacts  this  utility is that NVMe places pointers to host memory in its commands
       while SCSI leaves this detail to whichever transport it is using  (e.g.  SAS,  iSCSI,  SRP).  Since  this
       utility  takes  the  command  from  the  user (either on the command line or in a file named <u>CF</u>) but this
       utility allocates a data-in or data-out buffer as required, the user does not know in  advance  what  the
       address  of  that  buffer will be. Some special addresses have been introduced to help with this problem:
       the  address  0xfffffffffffffffe  is  interpreted  as  "use   the   data-in   buffer's   address"   while
       0xfffffffffffffffd  is  interpreted as "use the data-out buffer's address". Since NVMe uses little endian
       notation then that first address appears in the NVMe command byte stream as "fe" followed by seven "ff"s.
       A similar arrangement is made for the length of that buffer (in bytes), but  since  that  is  a  32  byte
       quantity, the first 4 bytes (all "ff"s) are removed.

       Several  command  file  examples  can  be  found in the inhex directory of this package's source tarball:
       nvme_identify_ctl.hex, nvme_dev_self_test.hex, nvme_read_ctl.hex and nvme_write_ctl.hex .

       Beware: the NVMe standard often refers to some of its fields as "0's based".  They are  typically  counts
       of  something  like  the  number  of  blocks to be read.  For example in NVMe Read command, a "0's based"
       number of blocks field containing the value 3 means to read 4 blocks! No, this is not a joke.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       These examples, apart from the last one, use Linux device names.  For  suitable  device  names  in  other
       supported Operating Systems see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

       sg_raw /dev/scd0 1b 00 00 00 02 00
              Eject the medium in CD drive /dev/scd0.

       sg_raw -r 1k /dev/sg0 12 00 00 00 60 00
              Perform an INQUIRY on /dev/sg0 and dump the response data (up to 1024 bytes) to stdout.

       sg_raw -s 512 -i i512.bin /dev/sda 3b 02 00 00 00 00 00 02 00 00
              Showing  an example of writing 512 bytes to a sector on a disk is a little dangerous. Instead this
              example will read i512.bin (assumed to be 512 bytes long) and use the SCSI WRITE BUFFER command to
              send it to the "data" buffer (that is mode 2). This is a safe operation.

       sg_raw -r 512 -o o512.bin /dev/sda 3c 02 00 00 00 00 00 02 00 00
              This will use the SCSI READ BUFFER command to read 512 bytes from the "data" buffer (i.e. mode  2)
              then  write  it to the o512.bin file.  When used in conjunction with the previous example, if both
              commands work then 'cmp i512.bin o512.bin' should show a match.

       sg_raw --infile=urandom.bin --send=512 --request=512 --outfile=out.bin "/dev/bsg/7:0:0:0" 53 00 00 00 00
       00 00 00 01 00
              This is a bidirectional <a href="../man10/XDWRITEREAD.10.html">XDWRITEREAD</a>(10) command being sent via a Linux bsg device. Note that  data
              is  being read from "urandom.bin" and sent to the device (data-out) while resulting data (data-in)
              is placed in the "out.bin" file. Also note the length of both is 512 bytes  which  corresponds  to
              the  transfer  length  of  1  (block)  in the cdb (i.e.  the second last byte). urandom.bin can be
              produced like this:
              dd if=/dev/urandom bs=512 count=1 of=urandom.bin

       sg_raw.exe PhysicalDrive1 a1 0c 0e 00 00 00 00 00 00 e0 00 00
              This  example  is  from  Windows  and  shows  a  ATA  STANDBY  IMMEDIATE  command  being  sent  to
              PhysicalDrive1.  That  ATA  command is contained within the SCSI ATA <a href="../man12/PASS-THROUGH.12.html">PASS-THROUGH</a>(12) command (see
              the SAT or SAT-2 standard at https://www.t10.org). Notice that the STANDBY IMMEDIATE command  does
              not  send  or  receive  any additional data, however if it fails sense data should be returned and
              displayed.

       For NVME examples see the files in this package's inhex directory that
              start with 'nvme_' such as inhex/nvme_identify_ctl.hex .
