       rt-serializer - Serialize an RT database to disk

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           rt-validator --check &amp;&amp; rt-serializer

       This script is used to write out the entire RT database to disk, for later import into a different RT
       instance.  It requires that the data in the database be self-consistent, in order to do so; please make
       sure that the database being exported passes validation by rt-validator before attempting to use
       "rt-serializer".

       While running, it will attempt to estimate the number of remaining objects to be serialized; these
       estimates are pessimistic, and will be incorrect if "--no-users", "--no-groups", or "--no-tickets" are
       used.

       If the controlling terminal is large enough (more than 25 columns high) and the "gnuplot" program is
       installed, it will also show a textual graph of the queue size over time.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--directory</b> <u>name</u>
           The  name  of  the output directory to write data files to, which should not exist yet; it is a fatal
           error  if  it  does.   Defaults  to  "./<u>$Organization</u>:<u>Date</u>/",  where  <u>$Organization</u>  is  as  set   in
           <u>RT_SiteConfig.pm</u>, and <u>Date</u> is today's date.

       <b>--force</b>
           Remove the output directory before starting.

       <b>--size</b> <u>megabytes</u>
           By  default,  "rt-serializer"  chunks  its output into data files which are around 32Mb in size; this
           option is used to set a different threshold size, in megabytes.  Note  that  this  is  the  threshold
           after  which  it  rotates  to  writing a new file, and is as such the <u>lower</u> <u>bound</u> on the size of each
           output file.

       <b>--no-users</b>
           By default, all privileged users are serialized; passing "--no-users" limits it to only  those  users
           which  are  referenced  by  serialized  tickets  and  history,  and  are  thus necessary for internal
           consistency.

       <b>--no-groups</b>
           By default, all groups are serialized;  passing  "--no-groups"  limits  it  to  only  system-internal
           groups, which are needed for internal consistency.

       <b>--no-assets</b>
           By default, all assets are serialized; passing "--no-assets" skips assets during serialization.

       <b>--no-deleted</b>
           By  default,  all  tickets and assets, including deleted ones, are serialized; passing "--no-deleted"
           skips deleted tickets and assets during serialization.

       <b>--scrips</b>
           No scrips or templates are serialized by default; this option forces all scrips and templates  to  be
           serialized.

       <b>--acls</b>
           No ACLs are serialized by default; this option forces all ACLs to be serialized.

       <b>--no-tickets</b>
           Skip serialization of all ticket data.

       <b>--limit-queues</b>
           Takes  a  list of queue IDs or names separated by commas. When provided, only that set of queues (and
           the tickets in them) will be serialized.

       <b>--limit-cfs</b>
           Takes a list of custom field IDs or names separated by commas. When provided, only that set of custom
           fields will be serialized.

       <b>--hyperlink-unmigrated</b>
           Replace links to local records which are not being migrated with hyperlinks.  The hyperlinks will use
           the serializing RT's configured URL.

           Without this option, such links are instead dropped, and transactions which had  updated  such  links
           will be replaced with an explanatory message.

       <b>--clone</b>
           Serializes your entire database, creating a clone.  This option should be used if you want to migrate
           your  RT  database  from  one  database type to another (e.g.  MySQL to Postgres).  It is an error to
           combine "--clone" with any option that limits object types  serialized.   No  dependency  walking  is
           performed  when  cloning.  "rt-importer" will detect that your serialized data set was generated by a
           clone.

       <b>--incremental</b>
           Will generate an incremenal serialized dataset using  the  data  stored  in  your  IncrementalRecords
           database  table.   This assumes that you have created that table and run RT using the Record_Local.pm
           shim as documented in "docs/incremental-export/".

       <b>--gc</b> <u>n</u>
           Adjust how often the garbage collection sweep is done; lower numbers are more frequent.  See "GARBAGE
           COLLECTION".

       <b>--page</b> <u>n</u>
           Adjust how many rows are pulled from the database in a single query.  Disable paging by setting  this
           to 0.  Defaults to 100.

           Keep  in  mind  that  rows  from RT's Attachments table are the limiting factor when determining page
           size.  You should likely be aiming for 60-75% of your total memory on an otherwise unloaded box.

       <b>--quiet</b>
           Do not show graphical progress UI.

       <b>--verbose</b>
           Do not show graphical progress UI, but rather log was each row is written out.

</pre><h4><b>GARBAGE</b> <b>COLLECTION</b></h4><pre>
       "rt-serializer" maintains a priority queue of objects to serialize,  or  searches  which  may  result  in
       objects  to  serialize.  When inserting into this queue, it does no checking if the object in question is
       already in the queue, or if the search will contain any results.  These checks are done when  the  object
       reaches the front of the queue, or during periodic garbage collection.

       During  periodic  garbage  collection,  the  entire  queue  is  swept for objects which have already been
       serialized, occur more than once in the queue, and searches which contain no  results  in  the  database.
       This  is  done  to reduce the memory footprint of the serialization process, and is triggered when enough
       new objects have been placed in the queue.  This parameter is tunable via  the  "--gc"  parameter,  which
       defaults  to running garbage collection every 5,000 objects inserted into the queue; smaller numbers will
       result in more frequent garbage collection.

       The default of 5,000 is roughly tuned based on a database with  several  thousand  tickets,  but  optimal
       values  will vary wildly depending on database configuration and size.  Values as low as 25 have provided
       speedups with smaller databases; if speed is a factor, experimenting with different "--gc" values may  be
       helpful.   Note that there are significant boundary condition changes in serialization rate, as the queue
       empties and fills, causing the time estimates to be rather imprecise  near  the  start  and  end  of  the
       process.

       Setting  "--gc" to 0 turns off all garbage collection.  Be aware that this will bloat the memory usage of
       the serializer.  Any negative value for "--gc" turns off periodic garbage collection and instead  objects
       already serialized or in the queue are checked for at the time they would be inserted.
