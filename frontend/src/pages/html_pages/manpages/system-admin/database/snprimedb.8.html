</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       snprimedb - feed the sn database.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>snprimedb</b> [-<b>i</b>] (no arguments)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>snprimedb</b>  reads  records  from  its  standard  input and enters them into the database.  The database is
       appended  to;  if  you  want  to  start  a  new  database,  you   would   delete   the   database   files
       <u>.chain</u>, <u>.table</u>, <u>.newsgroup</u> before running this program.

       The  main  purpose  of  <b>snprimedb</b> is to rebuild the ID database.  Then its input is usually obtained from
       <b>snscan</b>.

       If the option -<b>i</b> is given, simply initialize the database files if they do not exist, and exit.

       Input lines are of the format
       <u>newsgroup</u> <u>id</u> <u>serial</u> where <u>newsgroup</u> is the newsgroup the article may be found in, <u>id</u> is its  message  id,
       and  <u>serial</u>  is  the  local serial number of that article in that newsgroup.  If <u>newsgroup</u> is the special
       name <b>=junk</b>, then the whole line is ignored.

       You will need to be root or the owner of /var/spool/sn to do this.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>snprimedb</b> does not check to see that the articles really exist.  Also the size of the hash table is fixed
       at compile time.

       Under degenerate conditions, the hash table file <u>.chain</u> (see below) could grow very large, with reclaimed
       space remaining unused.  This is due to the very simple file space allocator, which doesn't know  how  to
       coalesce  adjacent free areas.  It doesn't know how to split them either.  The allocator assumes that the
       shape of the distribution of record lengths remains quite constant over time.

       The hash table database doesn't make any attempt to reduce its footprint.   This  should  be  acceptable,
       since the database is shared.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SNROOT</b> If  this  is  set  and is not empty, the value is used in place of <b>/var/spool/sn</b>, the default news
              spool directory.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /var/spool/sn<u>/.table</u>
              <b>snprimedb</b> uses this file as the index of the hash table, and ...

       /var/spool/sn<u>/.chain</u>
              as the hash chains, and ...

       /var/spool/sn<u>/.newsgroup</u>
              to attach an integer identifier to each newsgroup name.  This file is a human-readable  flat  text
              file.
