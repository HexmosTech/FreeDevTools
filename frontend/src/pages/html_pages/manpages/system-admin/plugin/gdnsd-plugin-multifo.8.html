</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gdnsd-plugin-multifo</b> is designed to do multi-address all-active failover grouping.  Basically, for each
       configured resource name, you supply a labeled list of addresses.  multifo monitors these addresses
       according to "service_types", and answers "DYNA" address queries using the non-"DOWN" subset.  The core
       gdnsd code will round-robin rotate the records on the way out, as it does for all address RR-sets.

</pre><h4><b>TOP-LEVEL</b> <b>PLUGIN</b> <b>CONFIG</b></h4><pre>
       At the top level of the plugin's configuration stanza, three special parameters "up_thresh",
       "service_types", and "ignore_health" are supported.  These set default per-resource options of the same
       name for any resources which do not define them explicitly.

       The rest of the hash entries at the top level are the names of the resources you define.  Each resource
       gets a configuration hash of its own for containing resource-specific parameters as well as the actual
       address data.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCE</b> <b>CONFIG</b></h4><pre>
       Within a resource, you have two basic options.  You can either directly specify a set of "label =&gt;
       address" pairs which are all the same family (IPv4 or IPv6), or you can use the sub-stanzas "addrs_v4"
       and/or "addrs_v6" to specify one or both families in the same resource.

       The "up_thresh", "service_types", and "ignore_health" parameters are inherited through every level, and
       can be overridden at any level (even per-address-family):

       <b>up_thresh</b>
           Floating  point,  default  0.5,  range  (0.0  -  1.0].   This configures the per-resource "up_thresh"
           threshold.  More details in "UP THRESH" below.

       <b>service_types</b>
           Array of strings, or single string.  Default "default".  This sets the  monitored  service_types  for
           this resource.  If an array of more than one is provided, all will be monitored for each address, and
           the net monitored state will be the minimum (worst) of the set.  See <b><a href="../man8/gdnsd.config.8.html">gdnsd.config</a></b>(8) for more details
           on service_types.

       <b>ignore_health</b>
           Boolean,  default  false.  If set to true, the health of individual addresses will not affect whether
           multifo adds them to the set of output addresses, but it will still  be  checked  and  used  for  the
           "up_thresh" calculation which is consumed by meta-plugins like geoip and metafo, which might use that
           information to fail over to a completely different datacenter as a result.

</pre><h4><b>SHORTCUT</b> <b>CONFIG</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  have  no  parameters  (service_types,  up_thresh,  ignore_health) to configure in a given stanza
       (single-family direct resource config, or addrs_v[46]), and do not care about the descriptive per-address
       labels used in monitoring, you can replace the hash with an array  of  addresses.   The  labels  will  be
       generated for you as a series of integers starting with 1.  For example, the following are equivalent:

          res1 =&gt; { addrs_v4 =&gt; [ 192.0.2.1, 192.0.2.2 ] }
          res1 =&gt; { addrs_v4 =&gt; { 1 =&gt; 192.0.2.1, 2 =&gt; 192.0.2.2 } }

</pre><h4><b>OPERATIONAL</b> <b>MECHANICS</b></h4><pre>
       All  of  the  addresses  for  all  of  the resources are monitored using the per-address-family inherited
       "service_types" specified (default would be the static virtual  monitor  "up").   When  the  core  daemon
       requests  a  lookup  for  address  records  of  a given family on one of this plugin's resources, it goes
       through essentially the following process to determine the set of response  addresses  for  that  address
       family:  1)  Add  all non-DOWN addresses to the result set.  2) If the set of non-DOWN addresses fail the
       up_thresh check, add *all* addresses to the result set as a fallback.  3) If any address is in  the  DOWN
       state, cut the zonefile-specified TTL in half.

       If  "ignore_health"  is  true,  all  addresses  are added to the result set regardless of health, but the
       up_thresh and TTL effects still happen, and the final resource-level state  still  reflects  the  overall
       state as it would without "ignore_health".

       This  process is repeated independently for each of the IPv4 and IPv6 address subsets, in the case that a
       resource has both address families configured (the TTL is only cut in half once of course).   Details  on
       the up_thresh check follow:

</pre><h4><b>UP</b> <b>THRESH</b></h4><pre>
       If  there  are  not  enough  UP addresses to pass the threshold (per address family), all addresses (of a
       given address family) will be returned as a fallback.

       The threshold is implemented mathematically as in the following pseudo-code "if(non_down &gt;= ceil(thresh *
       total)) threshold_passed;".  For example, if thresh is at the default value of 0.5, and there are 3 total
       IPv4 addresses, then 2 of them must be non-down to pass the threshold.  The net result is that  with  the
       default  threshold,  the  plugin  will  never return an isolated single address from a set of 3.  It will
       either return all 3, or it will return 2/3 if a single address from the set has failed.

       When the threshold check fails (and all addresses are returned) for either address family, resource-level
       total failure will also be signaled to any applicable upstream meta-plugins such as metafo or geoip.

       General rules for the results of the up_thresh formula:

       •   A threshold of 1.0 will only pass if <b>all</b> addresses are not-down.  This is mostly pointless, you might
           as well not monitor anything and set up these addresses as a static set in a zonefile.

       •   A threshold of 0.01 will pass even if only one address is alive and return  just  that  one  address,
           even if it's e.g. the only one left out of 40.

       •   Because  a  threshold  of  0.0  is illegal, if all addresses are down the threshold will always fail,
           returning all addresses.

       Intermediate value examples: (threshold: non-down/total required to pass threshold):

       •   0.1: 1/1 1/2 1/3 1/4 1/5 1/6 1/7 1/8 2/16

       •   0.2: 1/1 1/2 1/3 1/4 1/5 2/6 2/7 2/8 4/16

       •   0.3: 1/1 1/2 1/3 2/4 2/5 2/6 3/7 3/8 5/16

       •   0.4: 1/1 1/2 2/3 2/4 2/5 3/6 3/7 4/8 7/16

       •   0.5: 1/1 1/2 2/3 2/4 3/5 3/6 4/7 4/8 8/16

       •   0.6: 1/1 2/2 2/3 3/4 3/5 4/6 5/7 5/8 10/16

       •   0.7: 1/1 2/2 3/3 3/4 4/5 5/6 5/7 6/8 12/16

       •   0.8: 1/1 2/2 3/3 4/4 4/5 5/6 6/7 7/8 13/16

       •   0.9: 1/1 2/2 3/3 4/4 5/5 6/6 7/7 8/8 15/16
