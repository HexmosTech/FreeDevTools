</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gdnsd-plugin-extmon - gdnsd plugin for monitoring via external commands

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Example plugin config:

         service_types =&gt; {
           wget_ssl_index =&gt; {
             plugin =&gt; "extmon",
             timeout =&gt; 15,
             interval =&gt; 30,
             cmd =&gt; ["<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?wget">/usr/bin/wget</a>", "-T", "3", "-q", "-O", "/dev/null", "https://%%ITEM%%/index.html"]
           },
           svc_alwaysok =&gt; {
             plugin =&gt; "extmon",
             timeout =&gt; 1,
             direct =&gt; true,
             cmd =&gt; ["<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>", "-c", "exit 0"]
           },
           svc_alwaysfail_via_timeout =&gt; {
             plugin =&gt; "extmon",
             timeout =&gt; 2,
             max_proc =&gt; 10,
             cmd =&gt; ["<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>", "-c", "sleep 5"]
           }
         }

         # optional, if installed path confuses the daemon...
         plugins =&gt; {
           extmon =&gt; { helper_path =&gt; "/usr/libexec/gdnsd/gdnsd_extmon_helper" }
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gdnsd-plugin-extmon</b> allows you to configure external commands to provide monitoring feedback to the
       dynamic address plugins.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>-</b> <b>GLOBAL</b></h4><pre>
       These are plugin-global settings which are configured within "plugins =&gt; { extmon =&gt; { ... } }".

       <b>helper_path</b>
           String pathname, optional.

           Normally,  this  plugin  will  successfully  locate  its  helper  binary  <u>gdnsd_extmon_helper</u>  in the
           installation libexec directory at <u>/usr/libexec/gdnsd/gdnsd_extmon_helper</u>.   If  for  some  reason  it
           can't  do  so,  e.g.  due  to  a relocated installation, you can set an explicit full pathname to the
           helper here.

       <b>helper_failure_action</b>
           String, either "stasis" or "kill_daemon".  Default is "stasis".

           This configures the behavior of the plugin if the  helper  process  <u>gdnsd_extmon_helper</u>  unexpectedly
           dies, which prevents the gathering of any further legitimate monitoring state updates.

           Regardless of this setting, there will be at least one syslog message indicating the failure.

           If  set  to  "stasis",  all monitored states are left as-is with no further updates.  The downside is
           that unless someone notices the syslog message, this failure mode is hard to notice.

           If set to "kill_daemon", the whole gdnsd daemon will fail fatally.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>-</b> <b>PER-SERVICE-TYPE</b></h4><pre>
       The universal, plugin-neutral service_type parameters  all  apply  in  their  usual  sense:  "up_thresh",
       "ok_thresh",   "down_thresh",  "interval",  "plugin",  and  "timeout".   See  <b><a href="../man5/gdnsd.config.5.html">gdnsd.config</a></b>(5)  for  basic
       information on these.  The following are specific to this "extmon" plugin:

       <b>cmd</b> Array of one or more strings, required.

           This sets the command and arguments to execute  for  the  monitoring  check.   The  array  is  passed
           directly  to execv() for execution (with re-use of the first element as the pathname to execute).  If
           you need to use shell facilities, start the argument list with e.g. ""<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>", "-c", ...".

           All argument strings are searched for the magic string "%%ITEM%%" (which can  appear  multiple  times
           per  argument).   Everywhere this magic string is found, the IP address or CNAME text of the resource
           being monitored will be substituted in its place.

           The command must exit with an exit value of zero for success or non-zero for failure.

       <b>direct</b>
           Boolean, default false.

           Normally extmon's results are processed by the same anti-flap  state  machine  used  for  traditional
           monitors like the HTTP and TCP monitoring plugins.  This means the results are subject to the various
           thresholds  ("ok_thresh",  "up_thresh", "down_thresh") and it may take some time for a new persistent
           state to actually affect resolution.

           If "direct" is set to "true", the results of extmon's monitoring are applied directly and immediately
           as the final state of the monitored resources after every monitoring check.  If  your  command  flaps
           back and forther between success and failure on every run, so will the internal state and so will the
           resulting  changes  in  resolution.   Useful  if  extmon is actually gathering state from an external
           complex monitoring environment that has already taken care of things like anti-flap measures.

       <b>max_proc</b>
           Integer, default 0 (unlimited).

           The maximum number of concurrent processes to spawn.

           This sets the limit on the number of concurrent commands that will be run.  If the limit is exceeded,
           excess commands are rescheduled for 0.1 seconds later. After a few runs, the processes will be spread
           out enough to run without running into the limit.

</pre><h4><b>EXECUTION</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The plugin launches a helper binary <u>gdnsd_extmon_helper</u> during daemon startup, and this helper  does  the
       actual  runtime  command executions.  It manages the timeouts and intervals and feeds results back to the
       plugin over a pipe.  This communication is one-way at runtime (no daemon -&gt; helper traffic) for  security
       reasons  (to  help  ensure  that  a  compromised daemon can't easily leverage the helper to muck with the
       execution of the external commands).  This separation also prevents a class of  functional  and  security
       bugs related to mixing runtime pthreads with routine forking to exec the child processes.

       The executed scripts will run with the same userid the daemon normally drops privileges to.

       The  stdout,  stdin,  and  stderr descriptors will usually be set to <u>/dev/null</u>.  stdout and stderr may be
       open to the current tty if the main daemon was started in foreground debugging mode via "-f start".
