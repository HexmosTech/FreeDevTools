</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gdnsd-plugin-geoip</b> uses MaxMind's GeoIP2 binary databases to map address and CNAME results based on
       geography and monitored service availability.  It fully supports both IPv6 and the emerging edns-client-
       subnet standard.  If a request contains the edns-client-subnet option with a source netmask greater than
       zero, the edns-client-subnet information will be used instead of the source IP of the request (the IP of
       the querying cache).

       It supports the GeoIP2 format databases, which typically end in <u>.mmdb</u>.  It does not supports the legacy
       GeoIP1 format databases (which typically end in <u>.dat</u>).

       It can also be used with no GeoIP database at all, in which case the only network-mapping input comes
       from the "nets" config data or an external "nets" file, which explicitly map subnets to datacenter lists.

       This plugin can operate in an automatic distance-based mode (using a City-level database's coordinate
       information) It can also operate coordinate-free and rely on the user to configure a hierarchical map of
       cascading default user-location-to-datacenter mappings, starting at the continent level.

       The two modes can also be effectively mixed at geographic boundaries.

       For each "map" you define (which maps geographic location codes to preference-ordered lists of your
       datacenter locations), this plugin merges all of the raw GeoIP subnets into the largest possible
       supernets which contain identical responses in your configuration.  These in turn are used to set larger
       edns-client-subnet scope masks than you'd see simply returning raw GeoIP results.

</pre><h4><b>PLUGIN_METAFO</b></h4><pre>
       The documentation for <b><a href="../man8/gdnsd-plugin-metafo.8.html">gdnsd-plugin-metafo</a></b>(8) is required reading for understanding the geoip plugin
       documentation here.  The geoip plugin is an exact superset of the metafo plugin, and re-uses almost all
       of the metafo plugin's source code.  Metafo does failover along a single, global, ordered list of
       datacenters.  What plugin_geoip adds on top of the functionality of metafo is the ability to have the
       order of the datacenter failover list become dynamic per-request based on geographic hints derived from
       the client's network address.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>LOCATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration of this plugin can reference several external configuration and/or data files.  By
       default, all files referenced in this plugin's configuration are loaded from the <u>geoip</u> subdirectory of
       the daemon's configuration directory (default <u>/etc/gdnsd</u>).  You can load from other locations by
       specifying absolute file paths.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>-</b> <b>TOP-LEVEL</b></h4><pre>
       The top level of the geoip plugin's configuration (i.e. "plugins =&gt; { geoip =&gt; { ... } }") supports only
       three explicit keys.  One is the optional setting "undefined_datacenters_ok".

       The other two are required and expanded upon in detail in the next two sections: "maps", and "resources".
       The "maps" section defines one or more named mappings of location information from GeoIP binary databases
       to ordered subsets of datacenter names.  The "resources" section defines one or more named resources,
       each of which references one of the named maps and resolves datacenter names to specific sets of
       addresses or CNAMEs.

       Any other keys present at this level will be inherited down inside of each per-resource hash inside the
       "resources" stanza, acting as per-resource defaults for anything not defined explicitly there.

   <b>"undefined_datacenters_ok</b> <b>=</b> <b>false"</b>
       Boolean, default false.  If set to true, geoip resources are allowed to leave some of the datacenters
       specified in their "map" undefined in their resource-level "dcmap".  For example, a map M might define 3
       datacenters named A, B, and C, but a resource using map M might only define result addresses for
       datacenters B and C in its "dcmap".  This would otherwise be a hard configuration error.

       <b>!!!</b> <b>DANGER</b> <b>!!!</b> - Setting this value to true is a good way to shoot yourself in the foot if you're not
       very careful about how your maps and resources are configured with respect to each other, especially in
       "City Auto Mode".  Maps are calculated without any knowledge of the resources that use them.  If a
       specific network or location maps to a list of datacenters which contains none of the defined datacenters
       for a given resource, the results of runtime queries for that resource from that location or network will
       be the empty set (no answer records at all).  This is virtually guaranteed to happen in "City Auto Mode"
       if the number of undefined datacenters in a resource is greater than or equal to the map's
       "auto_dc_limit".

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>-</b> <b>MAPS</b></h4><pre>
       All "maps"-level configuration keys are the names of the maps you choose to define.  A map, conceptually,
       is a mapping between geography and/or network topology to varying ordered datacenter sub-sets.  The value
       of each named map must be a hash, and the following configuration keys apply within:

   <b>"geoip2_db</b> <b>=</b> <b>GeoIP2-City.mmdb"</b>
       String, filename, optional.  This is the filename of a MaxMind GeoIP2 format database.  It should contain
       either the City or Country data model.  There is no distinction made here for the IP version, and it is
       normal for these databases to contain both IPv4 and IPv6 data together.  If one or the other is missing,
       clients using that address family will be defaulted.

   <b>"datacenters</b> <b>=</b> <b>[</b> <b>one,</b> <b>two,</b> <b>three,</b> <b>...</b> <b>]"</b>
       Array of strings, required.  This is the total set of datacenter names used by this map.  You must define
       at least one datacenter name (although 2 or more would be infinitely more useful).  At this time, there
       is a maximum limit of 254 datacenter names per map, although this could be raised if anyone requires it.
       The order specified here is the fallback default result ordering in various default cases (e.g. if no
       explicit top-level map default list is given).

   <b>"ignore_ecs</b> <b>=</b> <b>true"</b>
       Boolean, default false.  If this is set to "true", all resources using this map will ignore EDNS Client
       Subnet (ECS) information when performing lookups against the map, relying solely on the DNS source IP for
       the lookup.  If the client provided ECS in such a query, the response will also contain the ECS option to
       signal that we're ECS aware in general, but the response scope mask will be set to zero to signal the
       cache that the ECS data wasn't used and the result is globally cacheable.

       This is useful for situations in which the map is intentionally meant to operate solely on recursor IPs
       rather than ECS IPs, but other maps serviced by the same authserver do make use of ECS data, and thus the
       global <b>edns_client_subnet</b> config option can't be used to disable handling the option completely for the
       whole server.

   <b>"nets</b> <b>=</b> <b>{</b> <b>...</b> <b>}"</b>
       Key-value hash, optional (see below for alternate form).  If specified, the contents should be key-value
       pairs of "network/netmask" mapped to a datacenter name (or an array of datacenter names).  Any network-
       to-datacenter mappings specified here will override mappings determined via GeoIP.  Note that it is
       illegal to specify networks in the IPv4-like subspaces of IPv6 other than v4compat, but it is legal to
       specify actual IPv4 networks (which are treated identically to v4compat).  See the section on IPv4
       Compatible Addresses later in this document for more details.  The order of the networks is unimportant;
       they will always be sorted and inserted such that an entry which is a subnet of another entry is not
       obliterated by the parent supernet.

           nets =&gt; {
               10.0.0.0/8 =&gt; [ dc1, dc2 ],
               192.0.2.128/25 =&gt; dc3
               2001:DB8::/32 =&gt; [ dc4, dc5, dc6 ],
           }

       In the case that one entry is a subnet of another with a different result dclist, the entries are merged
       correctly such that the supernet surrounds the subnet.  In the case of an exact duplicate entry (or an
       effective one, after merging smaller subnets) with a different dclist, it is arbitrary which one "wins"
       and the condition is warned about.  If you care about this case, you should sanitize your nets data
       beforehand with an external tool and/or parse for the warning message in log outputs.

   <b>"nets</b> <b>=</b> <b>nets_file_name"</b>
       String pathname, optional.  A variant of the above, but the contents of the key-value hash are loaded
       from the named external file.  This makes life easier for external tools and scripts generating large
       sets of nets entries (e.g. from BGP data).  The file will be monitored for changes and reloaded at
       runtime much like the GeoIP databases.

   <b>"map</b> <b>=</b> <b>{</b> <b>...</b> <b>}"</b>
       Key-value hash, optional.  This is the heart of a named map which uses GeoIP: the map itself, which maps
       places to ordered lists of datacenters.  It requires "geoip2_db" is also specified, and makes no sense
       without it.

       This is a nested key-value hash.  At each level, the keys are location codes (continent, country,
       region/subdivision, or city information depending on depth), and the values are either an ordered
       datacenter array (e.g. "[ dc03, dc01, dc04 ]"), or a sub-hash containing a deeper level of distinction.
       At each layer, a special key named "default" is available, which sets the default for everything within
       the current scope.  The top-level default itself defaults to the ordered list from "datacenters" in the
       normal case.  If the entire "map" stanza is missing or empty, you just get the default behavior of
       "default".  A datacenter array can also be empty, which implies that this location is mapped to receive
       no response data (the server will still respond to the query, and will not issue an NXDOMAIN.  It will
       simply be a NODATA/NOERROR response like you'd get if there were no records of this type, but could be
       records of other types for the same name).

   <b>GeoIP2</b> <b>Location</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Hierarchy</b>
       The top level of the map hierarchy is comprised of MaxMind's seven continent codes: "AF" for Africa, "AS"
       for Asia, "NA" for North America, "SA" for South America, "EU" for Europe, "OC" for Oceania, and "AN" for
       Antarctica.  The next level is the ISO 3166-1 2-letter country code.

       From here there are a number of Subdivision levels, the count of which varies for different network
       database entries.  In the US, for example, there is only one level of subdivision data for the US States.
       In the Czech Republic there are two levels of subdivision: first into 14 regions, and then further into
       91 districts.  Subdivisions are all specified using their ISO 3166-2 codes directly.

       After all subdivision levels, the final level is the City level.  The City names are all in the UTF-8
       character set.  Currently this plugin only uses the English city names from the database, even though
       other languages may be available depending on the database.

       As a pragmatic answer to the issues that can arise with multiple subdivision layers, the map
       automatically searches deeper in the database data when no map match is found at a given level of the map
       hierarchy beneath the Country level.  This means you can skip over any levels of Subdivision detail in
       your map that are irrelevant to you.

       For example, this targets the New Zealand regional council subdivision of Otago without explicitly
       specifying the enclosing subdivision for the South Island:

         { OC =&gt; { NZ =&gt; { OTA =&gt; [...] } } }

       As another example, this works correctly for targeting the city of Paris without caring about what layers
       of subdivisions lie between it and FR:

         { EU =&gt; { FR =&gt; { Paris =&gt; [...] } } }

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>-</b> <b>MAPS</b> <b>-</b> <b>CITY</b> <b>AUTO</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       "City-auto-mode" is a special mode of operation that automatically maps out the world to your datacenters
       based on coordinate math, so that you don't have to manually construct a complex hierarchical "map".  It
       can still be mixed with "map" of course, allowing you to use auto-mode for only select geographic areas
       if you wish (or disabling it for select areas by specifying manual lists).  The key parameter is
       "auto_dc_coords", which enables city-auto-mode.  This requires a City-level GeoIP2 database; the Country
       ones don't contain coordinate information.

       "auto_dc_coords = { ... }"
           Key-value  hash,  optional.   If  this  option  is specified, the whole map's basic mode of operation
           changes to "city-auto-mode".  The contents of the hash  are  a  key  for  each  datacenter  named  in
           "datacenters", with their values set to an array of "[lat, lon]" in decimal degree units.  When city-
           auto-mode  is enabled by this, the following configuration-validation changes occur from the default,
           static-mapping mode: the loaded GeoIP2 database(s) are required  be  City-level  databases,  and  the
           special keyword "auto" becomes a legal "datacenter list" in the "map" stanza.

           With  city-auto-mode  enabled,  the top-level map "default" defaults to "auto", but can be overridden
           with a manual list.  For any location  that  maps  to  "auto",  the  coordinates  specified  here  in
           "auto_dc_coords"  will  be compared with the coordinates from the City-level database(s) to determine
           an automatic distance-sorted datacenter list.

           If you omit one or more defined datacenters from  the  coordinate  list  in  "auto_dc_coords",  those
           datacenters  will  not  be  used in automatic results, but will still be available for manual use via
           "map" and/or "nets" entries.

       "auto_dc_limit = N"
           Unsigned integer, optional, default 3.  When city-auto-mode is in effect, this is  the  upper  length
           limit for auto-generated lists.  3 is a reasonable default even if you have a considerably longer set
           of  datacenters, as this provides a primary as well as two fallbacks.  Raising this to a large number
           in the presence of a long datacenter list will cause the set of unique  result  datacenter  lists  to
           increase  rapidly,  and  thus  reduce  the optimization of the final result database for edns-client-
           subnet purposes.  It's really not worth raising this value in almost any case, unless you really need
           to handle more than 3 random datacenters going offline at the same time and still have  clients  fail
           elsewhere.  The value zero is treated as unlimited (highly un-recommended).

       Under  city-auto-mode,  when the top-level default is (explicitly or implicitly) "auto", there is still a
       fallback static ordering which is the whole ordered  "datacenters"  list,  which  is  the  normal  static
       default  "default"  when  not  in  city-auto-mode.  This fallback is used when no location information is
       available at all (e.g. IPv6 client vs IPv4 GeoIP DB, Anonymous Proxies, etc).

</pre><h4><b>MAP</b> <b>TESTING</b></h4><pre>
       A binary program "gdnsd_geoip_test" is included.  This can be used directly from the commandline,  parses
       the relevant bits of your gdnsd config file for geoip map info, and then provides datacenter list results
       for  IP  address + map combinations supplied by the user.  Useful for debugging your maps and testing the
       mapping of client IPs.  It has a separate manpage <b><a href="../man1/gdnsd_geoip_test.1.html">gdnsd_geoip_test</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>-</b> <b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       Resource-level configuration  within  the  "resources"  stanza  is  nearly  identical  to  the  resources
       configuration  of  the metafo plugin, with all of the same basic behaviors about synthesizing or directly
       referencing the configuration of other plugins per-datacenter.

       One difference is that metafo's per-resource "datacenters" array is replaced with "map =&gt; mapname", which
       references one of the maps defined in the "maps" stanza, described in detail earlier.  The set of defined
       datacenters in the "dcmap" stanza must match the total set of datacenters defined by the referenced  map,
       unless "undefined_datacenters_ok" is set to "true" (see warnings and documentation above).

       The "skip_first" flag can also be set per resource, and is much more useful with the geoip plugin than it
       is  with  the  basic metafo plugin.  If this flag is set, the first datacenter in the failover list for a
       given lookup will be skipped, allowing the definition of a "second choice" resource using the same  basic
       map definition as the first choice.  In this case the original first choice is *never* a possible answer,
       and  the  rest  of  the  logic  (e.g.  skipping  datacenters  marked as down) proceeds as normal with the
       remaining list.  If the map entry and/or the resource  definition  have  already  reduced  the  effective
       datacenter count to one, the flag has no effect.

</pre><h4><b>META-PLUGIN</b> <b>INTERACTION</b></h4><pre>
       Both of the meta-plugins ("metafo" and "geoip") can reference their own as well as each others' resources
       by  direct  reference  within  a  "dcmap", so long as a resource does not directly refer to itself.  This
       allows plugin-layering configurations such as geoip -&gt; metafo -&gt; weighted, or metafo -&gt; geoip -&gt; multifo,
       or even metafo -&gt; metafo -&gt; simplefo, etc.

       Bear in mind that once you begin using inter-meta-plugin references, you could create a  reference  loop.
       gdnsd  does not currently detect or prevent such loops, and they will cause complete runtime failure when
       queried, probably by running out of stack space during recursion.

       Additionally, "geoip" can synthesize configuration for "metafo" resources, but the reverse does not hold;
       "metafo" cannot synthesize configuration for "geoip" resources.

</pre><h4><b>IPv4</b> <b>Compatible</b> <b>Addresses</b></h4><pre>
       This plugin knows of six different relatively-trivial ways to map IPv4 addresses into  the  IPv6  address
       space.   These are shown below in as much detail matters to this plugin, with "NNNN:NNNN" in place of the
       copied IPv4 address bytes:

                ::0000:NNNN:NNNN/96   # RFC 4291 - v4compat (deprecated)
                ::ffff:NNNN:NNNN/96   # RFC 4291 - v4mapped
           ::ffff:0000:NNNN:NNNN/96   # RFC 2765 - SIIT (obsoleted)
              64:ff9b::NNNN:NNNN/96   # RFC 6052 - Well-Known Prefix
           2001:0000:X:NNNN:NNNN/32   # RFC 4380 - Teredo (IPv4 bits are flipped)
                  2002:NNNN:NNNN::/16 # RFC 3056 - 6to4

           (in the Teredo case above, "X" represents some variable non-zero bytes
            that occupy the center 64 bits of the address).

       All of this plugin's internal lookup databases are IPv6  databases,  and  any  IPv4-like  information  is
       always stored in the v4compat space within these databases.  When doing runtime lookups all other v4-like
       addresses  (raw  IPv4  addresses,  v4mapped,  SIIT, WKP, Teredo, and 6to4) are converted to the canonical
       v4compat  IPv6  representation  before  querying  the  internal  databases.   The  other  representations
       (v4mapped, SIIT, WKP, Teredo, 6to4) are Undefined internally, and will never be referenced at lookup-time
       due to the v4compat conversion mentioned earlier.

       The  "nets"  stanza  is  not  allowed to specify entries in the five undefined v4-like IPv6 spaces (those
       other than v4compat).  Specify those networks as normal  IPv4  networks  or  v4compat  networks  instead.
       Legitimate  IPv6  "nets"  entries  which  happen to be a supernet of any v4-like spaces will *not* unduly
       affect v4-like lookups.  There is no functional difference  between  v4compat  and  native  v4  forms  in
       "nets", e.g. "192.0.2.0/24" and "::C000:0200/120" are completely identical.

       GeoIP  databases  that  are natively IPv4-only get all of their data loaded into the v4compat space only.
       For normal IPv6 GeoIP databases, by default we load the v4compat space directly (which is  where  MaxMind
       stores IPv4 data in their IPv6 databases), but ignore the v4mapped/SIIT/Teredo/6to4 spaces (some of which
       are empty in MaxMind's databases, and some of which simply alias the v4compat space).
