       gdnsd-plugin-reflect - gdnsd cache reflector plugin

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Zonefile RRs using reflect resolution

         reflect      10 DYNA reflect
         reflect-dns  10 DYNA reflect!dns
         reflect-edns 10 DYNA reflect!edns
         reflect-both 10 DYNA reflect!both
         reflect-best 10 DYNA reflect!best

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gdnsd-plugin-reflect</b> is a resolution plugin that acts as a live debugging tool.  It reflects a view of
       the client's network address back in the response in the form of "A" or "AAAA" RRs.  It can be used with
       both "DYNA" and "DYNC" RRs, and will return address data in both cases.

       The plugin can operate in one of four modes named "dns", "edns", "both", and "best", which can be
       selected by using the mode name as a resource name in the zonefile, as shown in the example above.  The
       default mode is "best".  The modes operate as follows:

       dns In the "dns" mode, the address in the response is always the source IP address of the request as seen
           by  gdnsd.   Note that this is generally the public address of a central cache/resolver server rather
           than the end-user client itself.

       edns
           In the "edns" mode, the  address  in  the  response  is  the  address  sent  by  the  client  in  the
           "edns-client-subnet"  option.  If the client did not send such an option, the IPv4 address 0.0.0.0 is
           returned.

       both
           In the "both" mode, both of the above results are returned in the same  response,  but  there  is  no
           artificial 0.0.0.0 added if no "edns-client-subnet" option was available.

       best
           In  the  "best" (default) mode, if the "edns-client-subnet" option was specified its data is returned
           as in the "edns" case, otherwise the source IP address is returned as in the "dns" case.
