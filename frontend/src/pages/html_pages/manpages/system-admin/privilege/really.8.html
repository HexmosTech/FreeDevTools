</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       really - gain privilege or run commands a different user

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>really</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>command</u> <u>args...</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>really</b>  checks whether the caller is allowed, and if it is it changes its uids and gids (and perhaps root
       directory) according to the command line options and executes the specified command.

       If no options are specified, the uid will be set to 0 and the  gids  and  root  directory  will  be  left
       unchanged.

       If no command is specified, <b>really</b> will run <b>$SHELL</b> <b>-i</b>.

       A caller is allowed if it has write access to <b>/etc/inittab</b> and is also member of the group <b>root</b>.  This is
       most  easily  achieved  by  making  inittab  group-writeable  by  some  suitable group containing all the
       appropriate users, and making <b>/etc/inittab</b> group-owned by that group and group-writeable.  The root group
       is perhaps a good choice if it isn't being used for anything else.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-u</b> <u>username</u> | <b>--user</b> <u>username</u>
              Sets the uid, gid, and supplementary group list, according to <u>username</u>'s entry in the password and
              group databases.

       <b>-i</b> <u>username</u> | <b>--useronly</b> <u>username</u>
              Sets only the uid according to <u>username</u>'s entry in the password database.

       <b>-I</b> <u>uid</u> | <b>--uidonly</b> <u>uid</u>
              Sets the uid to the numeric value <u>uid</u> (which need not correspond  to  any  existing  user  in  the
              password database).

       <b>-g</b> <u>groupname</u> | <b>--group</b> <u>groupname</u>
              <u>groupname</u>  is  looked  up  in  the  group  database  and  its  gid  is  appended  to the process's
              supplementary groups list.  If this is the first gid specified it will also be set as the  primary
              gid.

       <b>-G</b> <u>gid</u> | <b>--gid</b> <u>gid</u>
              <u>gid</u>  is  appended  to  the  process's  supplementary groups list.  (<u>gid</u> need not correspond to any
              existing group in the group database.)  If this is the first gid specified it will also be set  as
              the primary gid.

       <b>-z</b> | <b>--groupsclear</b>
              Clears  the  process's supplementary groups list.  When using this option you must also specify <b>-g</b>
              or <b>-G</b>.  The process's groups will then be exactly those specified.  The relative position of <b>-z</b> in
              the argument list is not relevant.

       <b>-R</b> <u>root-dir</u> | <b>--chroot</b> <u>root-dir</u>
              The program will have its root directory set to <u>root-dir</u>.

              <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>option</b> <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b>: Unlike <a href="../man8/chroot.8.html">chroot</a>(8), the  current  working
              directory  will  remain  unchanged.  This means that if the current directory isn't underneath the
              specified new root, the program will still be able to access files outside the new root  by  using
              relative pathnames.  If this isn't what you want, please use the chroot utility instead.

       <b>--</b>     Indicates  the  end  of  the  options.   The next argument (if present) will be interpreted as the
              command name, even if it starts with a hyphen.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b> <b>CONSIDERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>really</b> is designed so that installing it setuid root is extremely unlikely to compromise the security  of
       any  system.  It will check using <b><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></b>(2) whether the real user is allowed to write to <b>/etc/inittab</b> and
       if this check fails <b>really</b> will exit without even attempting to parse its command line.

       <b>really</b> is <b>not</b> designed to be resistant to malicious command  line  arguments.   Do  not  allow  untrusted
       processes  to  pass  options to really, or to specify the command to be run.  Whether it is safe to allow
       relatively untrusted processes to pass options to the command which is to be run depends on the behaviour
       of that command and its security status.

       Attempting to use <b>really</b> to drop privilege is dangerous unless  the  calling  environment  is  very  well
       understood.   There are many inherited process properties and resources which might be used by the callee
       to escalate its privilege to that of the (root-equivalent) caller.  For  this  function,  it  is  usually
       better to use <b>userv</b> if possible.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>really</b>  does  not  manipulate  the  environment  at  all.  The calling program is run in exactly the same
       environment as the caller passes to <b>really</b>.  In particular, <b>really</b> will not add <b>sbin</b> directories to  <b>PATH</b>
       so  <b>really</b>-enabled accounts will usually need to have these directories on their configured <b>PATH</b> to start
       with.

       <b>SHELL</b> is used to find the default shell to use in interactive mode (ie, when no command is specified).
