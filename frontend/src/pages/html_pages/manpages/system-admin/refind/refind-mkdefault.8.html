</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       refind-mkdefault - Set rEFInd as the default EFI boot option

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>refind-mkdefault</b> [ -L|--label &lt;name&gt; ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       EFI  booting normally relies on boot manager entries stored in NVRAM, which describe the locations of EFI
       boot programs and the order in which the firmware will attempt to launch them. In  Linux,  these  entries
       can be created, deleted, and manipulated with the <u>efibootmgr</u> utility.

       Many  OSes  and Linux packages assume that they should control the boot process, and so both create NVRAM
       boot entries for themselves and set these entries first in the  boot  order.  If  you  intend  rEFInd  to
       control  the  boot  process,  though, such changes are undesirable and require adjustment via <u>efibootmgr</u>.
       Such adjustments are annoying to make and can be intimidating to non-experts.

       The <u>refind-mkdefault</u> script simplifies matters: Running this script with no options sets  rEFInd  as  the
       default  boot program. The details of what the script does depends on the current state of the boot order
       list and existing boot entries:

       <b>*</b>      If a rEFInd entry already exists in the boot order and is already first in the  list,  no  changes
              are made.

       <b>*</b>      If  a  rEFInd  entry  already exists in the boot order but is not first in the list, that entry is
              moved to the first position in the boot order.

       <b>*</b>      If more than one rEFInd entry exists in the boot order, <u>refind-mkdefault</u> moves the one that  comes
              earliest to the front of the boot order list.

       <b>*</b>      If  no  rEFInd  entry exists in the boot order but a rEFInd boot entry can be found in the list of
              <b>Boot####</b> entries, it is added to the boot order and placed at the front of the list.

       <b>*</b>      If multiple rEFInd boot entries exist but none is in the boot order, all the entries are added  to
              the boot order, but which one is first is uncontrolled.

       A  rEFInd  entry  is defined as one that contains the string <b>refind</b> (case-insensitive). This string could
       exist in the description or in the filename. The string used to define the rEFInd entry  can  be  changed
       via the <u>--label</u> (<u>-L</u>) option.

       The  intent  is that <u>refind-mkdefault</u> can be called after booting via GRUB or some other means to restore
       rEFInd as the default boot program.  It can also be placed in a startup and/or shutdown script to restore
       rEFInd to its default position automatically. Because it does not re-write the boot order  if  rEFInd  is
       listed as the first boot entry, this practice should be low in risk.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-L</b> <b>|</b> <b>--label</b> <u>&lt;name&gt;</u>
              Instead  of  searching  for  the  string  <b>refind</b> in <u>efibootmgr</u> output as a way to identify rEFInd,
              search for the string <b>name</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>refind-mkdefault</u> returns the following values:

       <b>0</b>      The script completed successfully, which can mean either that no change was necessary or that  the
              call to <u>efibootmgr</u> returned a success code.

       <b>1</b>      EFI  boot  order variables are available, and a rEFInd entry was found, but the call to <u>efibootmgr</u>
              returned a failure code.

       <b>2</b>      EFI boot entries are not available. This condition is often an indication of a buggy EFI or  badly
              damaged NVRAM contents.

       <b>3</b>      No  rEFInd  entry  could  be found in the list of boot options, and so no changes were made to the
              boot order list.

       <b>4</b>      The script could not run because of OS issues -- the OS was not Linux, the <u>efibootmgr</u> utility  was
              not available, or the script was not run as <u>root</u>.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>*</b>      <u>refind-mkdefault</u>  does  not  work  when booted in BIOS mode (including via a Compatibility Support
              Module, or CSM, on an EFI-based computer).  Similarly, it does  not  work  if  <u>efibootmgr</u>  is  not
              installed or fails to work for any reason.

       <b>*</b>      The  script  uses a very simple algorithm to determine what to move to the start of the boot order
              list. This algorithm may fail if the system has redundant or non-functional rEFInd boot entries or
              if those entries are not named in an expected fashion. Cleaning up the boot entries by manual  use
              of <u>efibootmgr</u> may be necessary in such cases.
