</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nsd-checkzone</b> - NSD zone file syntax checker.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nsd-checkzone</b> [<b>-h</b>] <u>zonename</u> <u>zonefile</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nsd-checkzone</b> reads a DNS zone file and checks it for errors.  It prints errors to stderr.  On failure it
       exits with nonzero exit status.

       This is used to check files before feeding them to the <a href="../man8/nsd.8.html">nsd</a>(8) daemon.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Print usage help information and exit.

       <u>zonename</u>
              The name of the zone to check, eg. "example.com".

       <u>zonefile</u>
              The file to read, eg. "zones/example.com.zone.signed". Use "-" to read from stdin.

       <b>-p</b>     Print  the  zone  contents  to  stdout  if the zone is ok. This prints the contents as it has been
              parsed, not literally a copy of the input, but as printed by the formatting routines in NSD,  much
              like the nsd-control command write does.

       <b>-i</b> <u>&lt;oldzonefile&gt;</u>
              Create  an IXFR from the differences between the old zone file and the new zone file. The argument
              to the -i option is the old zone file, the other zonefile argument passed is the new zonefile.

              The difference is computed between the two zonefiles by keeping one version of the zone in memory,
              and another version in a temporary file. The temporary file is located at the zonefile  directory.
              This  is  also where the result is written, to a file with the zonefile name, ending with '.ixfr'.
              This is also where NSD reads it when IXFRs are configured for the zone.

              The other existing ixfr files are renamed to become older IXFR contents for the zone, if any  such
              files exist.  If the output file already exists with the correct contents, no new file is created.
              The contents of the header of the output file are checked for that, if it already exists.

       <b>-n</b> <u>&lt;ixfr</u> <u>number&gt;</u>
              The  number  of  IXFR  versions  to store, at most. Default 5. This is the number of files that is
              created with ixfr contents for the zone. Older stored IXFR versions are deleted when the number is
              exceeded.

       <b>-s</b> <u>&lt;ixfr</u> <u>size&gt;</u>
              The number of bytes of storage to use for IXFRs. Default is 1048576. If an IXFR is  bigger  it  is
              not created, and if the sum of IXFR storage exceeds it, older IXFRs versions are deleted.
