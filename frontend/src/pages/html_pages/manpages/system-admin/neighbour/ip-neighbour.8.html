</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ip</b> <b>neigh</b> command manipulates <u>neighbour</u> objects that establish bindings between protocol addresses and
       link layer addresses for hosts sharing the same link.  Neighbour entries are organized into tables. The
       IPv4 neighbour table is also known by another name - the ARP table.

       The corresponding commands display neighbour bindings and their properties, add new neighbour entries and
       delete old ones.

       ip neighbour add
              add a new neighbour entry

       ip neighbour change
              change an existing entry

       ip neighbour replace
              add a new entry or change an existing one

              These commands create new neighbour records or update existing ones.

              <b>to</b> <u>ADDRESS</u> <b>(default)</b>
                     the protocol address of the neighbour. It is either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

              <b>dev</b> <u>NAME</u>
                     the interface to which this neighbour is attached.

              <b>proxy</b>  indicates whether we are proxying for this neighbour entry

              <b>router</b> indicates whether neighbour is a router

              <b>use</b>    this  neigh  entry  is  in  "use". This option can be used to indicate to the kernel that a
                     controller is using this dynamic entry. If the  entry  does  not  exist,  the  kernel  will
                     resolve it. If it exists, an attempt to refresh the neighbor entry will be triggered.

              <b>managed</b>
                     this  neigh  entry  is  "managed". This option can be used to indicate to the kernel that a
                     controller is using this dynamic entry. In contrast to "use", if the entry does not  exist,
                     the kernel will resolve it and periodically attempt to auto-refresh the neighbor entry such
                     that it remains in resolved state when possible.

              <b>extern_learn</b>
                     this  neigh entry was learned externally. This option can be used to indicate to the kernel
                     that this is a controller learnt dynamic entry.  Kernel will not gc such an entry.

              <b>lladdr</b> <u>LLADDRESS</u>
                     the link layer address of the neighbour.  <u>LLADDRESS</u> can also be <b>null</b>.

              <b>nud</b> <u>STATE</u>
                     the state of the neighbour entry.  <b>nud</b> is an  abbreviation  for  'Neighbour  Unreachability
                     Detection'.  The state can take one of the following values:

                     <b>permanent</b>
                            the neighbour entry is valid forever and can be only be removed administratively.

                     <b>noarp</b>  the neighbour entry is valid. No attempts to validate this entry will be made but it
                            can be removed when its lifetime expires.

                     <b>reachable</b>
                            the neighbour entry is valid until the reachability timeout expires.

                     <b>stale</b>  the  neighbour  entry  is  valid  but  suspicious.  This option to <b>ip</b> <b>neigh</b> does not
                            change the neighbour state if it was valid and the address is not  changed  by  this
                            command.

                     <b>none</b>   this  is  a  pseudo  state  used  when initially creating a neighbour entry or after
                            trying to remove it before it becomes free to do so.

                     <b>incomplete</b>
                            the neighbour entry has not (yet) been validated/resolved.

                     <b>delay</b>  neighbor entry validation is currently delayed.

                     <b>probe</b>  neighbor is being probed.

                     <b>failed</b> max number of probes exceeded without success, neighbor  validation  has  ultimately
                            failed.

       ip neighbour delete
              delete a neighbour entry

              The arguments are the same as with <b>ip</b> <b>neigh</b> <b>add</b>, except that <b>lladdr</b> and <b>nud</b> are ignored.

              <b>Warning:</b>  Attempts  to delete or manually change a <b>noarp</b> entry created by the kernel may result in
              unpredictable behaviour.  Particularly, the kernel may try to resolve this address even on a <b>NOARP</b>
              interface or if the address is multicast or broadcast.

       ip neighbour show
              list neighbour entries

              <b>to</b> <u>ADDRESS</u> <b>(default)</b>
                     the prefix selecting the neighbours to list.

              <b>dev</b> <u>NAME</u>
                     only list the neighbours attached to this device.

              <b>vrf</b> <u>NAME</u>
                     only list the neighbours for given VRF.

              <b>nomaster</b>
                     only list neighbours attached to an interface with no master.

              <b>proxy</b>  list neighbour proxies.

              <b>unused</b> only list neighbours which are not currently in use.

              <b>nud</b> <u>STATE</u>
                     only list neighbour entries in this state.  <u>NUD_STATE</u> takes  values  listed  below  or  the
                     special  value  <b>all</b>  which means all states. This option may occur more than once.  If this
                     option is absent, <b>ip</b> lists all entries except for <b>none</b> and <b>noarp</b>.

       ip neighbour flush
              flush neighbour entries
              This command has the same arguments as <b>show.</b>  The differences are that it does  not  run  when  no
              arguments  are given, and that the default neighbour states to be flushed do not include <b>permanent</b>
              and <b>noarp</b>.

              With the <b>-statistics</b> option, the command becomes verbose. It prints  out  the  number  of  deleted
              neighbours  and  the  number  of  rounds made to flush the neighbour table. If the option is given
              twice, <b>ip</b> <b>neigh</b> <b>flush</b> also dumps all the deleted neighbours.

       ip neigh get
              lookup a neighbour entry to a destination given a device

              <b>proxy</b>  indicates whether we should lookup a proxy neighbour entry

              <b>to</b> <u>ADDRESS</u> <b>(default)</b>
                     the prefix selecting the neighbour to query.

              <b>dev</b> <u>NAME</u>
                     get neighbour entry attached to this device.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       ip neighbour
              Shows the current neighbour table in kernel.

       ip neigh flush dev eth0
              Removes entries in the neighbour table on device eth0.

       ip neigh get 10.0.1.10 dev eth0
              Performs a neighbour lookup in the kernel and returns a neighbour entry.
