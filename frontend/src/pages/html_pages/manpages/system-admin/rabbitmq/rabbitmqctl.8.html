</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rabbitmqctl — tool for managing RabbitMQ nodes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rabbitmqctl</b> [<b>-q</b>] [<b>-s</b>] [<b>-l</b>] [<b>-n</b> <u>node</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u>] <u>command</u> [<u>command_options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       RabbitMQ is an open-source multi-protocol messaging broker.

       <b>rabbitmqctl</b>  is  the  main  command  line  tool  for  managing  a  RabbitMQ  server  node,  together with
       <b>rabbitmq-diagnostics</b> , <b>rabbitmq-upgrade</b> , and others.

       It performs all actions by connecting to the target RabbitMQ node on a dedicated CLI  tool  communication
       port and authenticating using a shared secret (known as the cookie file).

       Diagnostic  information  is  displayed  if  the  connection  failed,  the target node was not running, or
       <b>rabbitmqctl</b> could not authenticate to the target node successfully.

       To learn more, see the <u>RabbitMQ</u> <u>CLI</u> <u>Tools</u> <u>guide</u>: https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/cli

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-n</b> <u>node</u>
               The default node is "<u>rabbit@target-hostname</u>", where <u>target-hostname</u> is the local host.  On a host
               named  "myserver.example.com",  the  node  name  will  usually   be   "rabbit@myserver"   (unless
               RABBITMQ_NODENAME has been overridden, in which case you'll need to use

       <b>--longnames</b>
               ).   The  output of "hostname -s" is usually the correct hostname to use after the "@" sign.  See
               <u><a href="../man8/rabbitmq-server.8.html">rabbitmq-server</a></u>(8) for details of configuring a RabbitMQ node.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
               Quiet output mode is selected.  Informational messages are reduced when quiet mode is in effect.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--silent</b>
               Silent output mode is selected.   Informational  messages  are  reduced  and  table  headers  are
               suppressed when silent mode is in effect.

       <b>--no-table-headers</b>
               Do not output headers for tabular data.

       <b>--dry-run</b>
               Do not run the command.  Only print informational messages.

       <b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u>, <b>--timeout</b> <u>timeout</u>
               Operation timeout in seconds.  Not all commands support timeouts.  The default is <b>infinity</b>.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--longnames</b>
               Must  be  specified when the cluster is configured to use long (FQDN) node names.  To learn more,
               see the <u>RabbitMQ</u> <u>Clustering</u> <u>guide</u>: https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/clustering

       <b>--erlang-cookie</b> <u>cookie</u>
               Shared secret to use to authenticate to the target node.   Prefer  using  a  local  file  or  the
               RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE  environment  variable  instead  of  specifying this option on the command
               line.  To learn more, see the <u>RabbitMQ</u> <u>CLI</u> <u>Tools</u> <u>guide</u>: https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/cli

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>help</b> [<b>-l</b>] [<u>command_name</u>]

               Prints usage for all available commands.

               <b>-l</b>, <b>--list-commands</b>
                       List command usages only, without parameter explanation.

               <u>command_name</u>
                       Prints usage for the specified command.

       <b>version</b>

               Displays CLI tools version

   <b>Nodes</b>
       <b>await_startup</b>

               Waits for the RabbitMQ application to start on the target node

               For example, to wait for the RabbitMQ application to start:

                     <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>await_startup</b>

       <b>reset</b>

               Returns a RabbitMQ node to its virgin state.

               Removes the node from any cluster it belongs to, removes all data from the  management  database,
               such as configured users and vhosts, and deletes all persistent messages.

               For  <b>reset</b>  and <b>force_reset</b> to succeed the RabbitMQ application must have been stopped, e.g. with
               <b>stop_app</b>.

               For example, to reset the RabbitMQ node:

                     <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>reset</b>

       <b>rotate_logs</b>

               Instructs the RabbitMQ node to perform internal log rotation.

               Log rotation is performed according to the logging settings specified in the configuration  file.
               The  rotation  operation is asynchronous, there is no guarantee that it will complete before this
               command returns.

               Note that there is no need to call this command in case  of  external  log  rotation  (e.g.  from
               <a href="../man8/logrotate.8.html">logrotate</a>(8)).

               For example, to initial log rotation:

                     <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>rotate_logs</b>

       <b>shutdown</b>

               Shuts  down  the  node,  both  RabbitMQ and its runtime.  The command is blocking and will return
               after the runtime process exits.  If RabbitMQ fails to stop, it will return a non-zero exit code.
               This command infers the OS PID of the target node and therefore can only be  used  to  shut  down
               nodes  running  on  the same host (or broadly speaking, in the same operating system, e.g. in the
               same VM or container)

               Unlike the stop command, the shutdown command:

               <b>•</b>   does not require a <u>pid_file</u> to wait for the runtime process to exit

               <b>•</b>   returns a non-zero exit code if the RabbitMQ node is not running

               For example, this will shut down a local RabbitMQ node running with the default node name:

                     <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>shutdown</b>

       <b>start_app</b>

               Starts the RabbitMQ application.

               This command is typically run after performing other management actions that require the RabbitMQ
               application to be stopped, e.g. <b>reset</b>.

               For example, to instruct the RabbitMQ node to start the RabbitMQ application:

                     <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>start_app</b>

       <b>stop</b> [<u>pid_file</u>]

               Stops the Erlang node on which RabbitMQ is running.  To restart the node follow the  instructions
               for "Running the Server" in the <u>installation</u> <u>guide</u>: https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/download.

               If  a  <u>pid_file</u>  is  specified, also waits for the process specified there to terminate.  See the
               description of the <b>wait</b> command for details on this file.

               For example, to instruct the RabbitMQ node to terminate:

                     <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>stop</b>

       <b>stop_app</b>

               Stops the RabbitMQ application, leaving the runtime (Erlang VM) running.

               This command is typically run  before  performing  other  management  actions  that  require  the
               RabbitMQ application to be stopped, e.g. <b>reset</b>.

               For example, to instruct the RabbitMQ node to stop the RabbitMQ application:

                     <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>stop_app</b>

       <b>wait</b> <u>pid_file</u>, <b>wait</b> <b>--pid</b> <u>pid</u>

               Waits for the RabbitMQ application to start.

               This  command  will wait for the RabbitMQ application to start at the node.  It will wait for the
               pid file to be created if <u>pidfile</u> is specified, then for a process with a pid  specified  in  the
               pid  file  or the <b>--pid</b> argument, and then for the RabbitMQ application to start in that process.
               It will fail if the process terminates without starting the RabbitMQ application.

               If the specified pidfile is not created or the erlang node is not started  within  <b>--timeout</b>  the
               command will fail.  The default timeout is 10 seconds.

               A  suitable pid file is created by the <u><a href="../man8/rabbitmq-server.8.html">rabbitmq-server</a></u>(8) script.  By default, this is located in
               the Mnesia directory.  Modify the RABBITMQ_PID_FILE environment variable to change the location.

               For example, this command will return when the RabbitMQ node has started up:

                     <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>wait</b> <b>/var/run/rabbitmq/pid</b>

   <b>Cluster</b> <b>management</b>
       <b>await_online_nodes</b> <u>count</u>

               Waits for <u>count</u> nodes to join the cluster

               For example, to wait for two RabbitMQ nodes to start:

                     <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>await_online_nodes</b> <b>2</b>

       <b>change_cluster_node_type</b> <u>type</u>

               Changes the type of the cluster node.

               The <u>type</u> must be one of the following:
               <b>•</b>   <b>disc</b>
               <b>•</b>   <b>ram</b>

               The node must be stopped for this operation to succeed, and when turning a node into a  RAM  node
               the node must not be the only disc node in the cluster.

               For example, this command will turn a RAM node into a disc node:

                     <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>change_cluster_node_type</b> <b>disc</b>

       <b>cluster_status</b>

               Displays  all  the nodes in the cluster grouped by node type, together with the currently running
               nodes.

               For example, this command displays the nodes in the cluster:

                     <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>cluster_status</b>

       <b>force_boot</b>

               Ensures that the node will start next time, even if it was not the last to shut down.

               Normally when you shut down a RabbitMQ cluster altogether, the first node you restart  should  be
               the  last  one  to  go  down, since it may have seen things happen that other nodes did not.  But
               sometimes that's not possible: for instance, if the entire cluster loses power then all nodes may
               think they were not the last to shut down.

               In such a case you can invoke <b>force_boot</b> while the node is down.  This  will  tell  the  node  to
               unconditionally  start the next time you ask it.  Any changes to the cluster after this node shut
               down will be lost.

               If the last node to go down is permanently lost then you should use <b>forget_cluster_node</b> <b>--offline</b>
               instead of this command, as it will ensure that mirrored queues whose leader replica was  on  the
               lost node get promoted.

               For example, this will force the node not to wait for other nodes the next time it is started:

                     <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>force_boot</b>

       <b>force_reset</b>

               Forcefully returns a RabbitMQ node to its virgin state.

               The <b>force_reset</b> command differs from <b>reset</b> in that it resets the node unconditionally, regardless
               of  the current management database state and cluster configuration.  It should only be used as a
               last resort if the database or cluster configuration has been corrupted.

               For <b>reset</b> and <b>force_reset</b> to succeed the RabbitMQ application must have been stopped,  e.g.  with
               <b>stop_app</b>.

               For example, to reset the RabbitMQ node:

                     <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>force_reset</b>

       <b>forget_cluster_node</b> [<b>--offline</b>]

               <b>--offline</b>
                       Enables  node  removal  from an offline node.  This is only useful in the situation where
                       all the nodes are offline and the last node to go down cannot  be  brought  online,  thus
                       preventing  the  whole  cluster  from  starting.   It  should  not  be  used in any other
                       circumstances since it can lead to inconsistencies.

               Removes a cluster node remotely.  The node that is being removed must be offline, while the  node
               we are removing from must be online, except when using the <b>--offline</b> flag.

               When  using  the  <b>--offline</b>  flag  , <b>rabbitmqctl</b> will not attempt to connect to a node as normal;
               instead it will temporarily become the node in order to make the change.  This is useful  if  the
               node  cannot  be  started  normally.  In this case, the node will become the canonical source for
               cluster metadata (e.g. which queues exist), even if it was not before.  Therefore you should  use
               this command on the latest node to shut down if at all possible.

               For example, this command will remove the node "rabbit@stringer" from the node "hare@mcnulty":

                     <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>-n</b> <b>hare@mcnulty</b> <b>forget_cluster_node</b> <b>rabbit@stringer</b>

       <b>join_cluster</b> <u>seed-node</u> [<b>--ram</b>]

               <u>seed-node</u>
                       Existing cluster member (seed node) to cluster with.

               <b>--ram</b>   If  provided, the node will join the cluster as a RAM node.  RAM node use is discouraged.
                       Use only if you understand why exactly you need to use them.

               Instructs the node to become a member of the cluster that  the  specified  node  is  in.   Before
               clustering,  the  node  is  reset,  so  be  careful when using this command.  For this command to
               succeed the RabbitMQ application must have been stopped, e.g. with <b>stop_app</b>.

               Cluster nodes can be of two types: disc or RAM.  Disc nodes replicate data in RAM  and  on  disk,
               thus  providing  redundancy  in the event of node failure and recovery from global events such as
               power failure across all nodes.  RAM nodes replicate data in RAM only (except for queue contents,
               which can reside on disk if the queue is persistent or too big to fit in memory) and  are  mainly
               used  for  scalability.   RAM  nodes  are  more  performant  only  when  managing resources (e.g.
               adding/removing queues, exchanges, or bindings).  A cluster must always have at  least  one  disc
               node and usually should have more than one.

               The  node  will  be  a disc node by default.  If you wish to create a RAM node, provide the <b>--ram</b>
               flag.

               After executing the <b>join_cluster</b> command, whenever the RabbitMQ application  is  started  on  the
               current  node it will attempt to connect to the nodes that were in the cluster when the node went
               down.

               To  leave  a  cluster,  <b>reset</b>  the  node.   You  can  also  remove  nodes   remotely   with   the
               <b>forget_cluster_node</b> command.

               For  example,  this  command instructs the RabbitMQ node to join the cluster that "hare@elena" is
               part of, as a ram node:

                     <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>join_cluster</b> <b>hare@elena</b> <b>--ram</b>

   <b>User</b> <b>Management</b>
               Note that all user management commands <b>rabbitmqctl</b> only can manage users in the internal RabbitMQ
               database.  Users from any alternative authentication backends such as LDAP cannot be inspected or
               managed with those commands.  <b>rabbitmqctl</b>.

               <b>add_user</b> <u>username</u> <u>password</u>

                       <u>username</u>
                               The name of the user to create.

                       <u>password</u>
                               The password the created user will use to log in to the broker.

                       For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to create a  (non-administrative)
                       user named "janeway" with (initial) password "changeit":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>add_user</b> <b>janeway</b> <b>changeit</b>

               <b>authenticate_user</b> <u>username</u> <u>password</u>

                       <u>username</u>
                               The name of the user.

                       <u>password</u>
                               The password of the user.

                       For  example,  this  command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to authenticate the user named
                       "janeway" with the password "verifyit":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>authenticate_user</b> <b>janeway</b> <b>verifyit</b>

               <b>change_password</b> <u>username</u> <u>newpassword</u>

                       <u>username</u>
                               The name of the user whose password is to be changed.

                       <u>newpassword</u>
                               The new password for the user.

                       For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to change the  password  for  the
                       user named "janeway" to "newpass":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>change_password</b> <b>janeway</b> <b>newpass</b>

               <b>clear_password</b> <u>username</u>

                       <u>username</u>
                               The name of the user whose password is to be cleared.

                       For  example,  this  command  instructs the RabbitMQ broker to clear the password for the
                       user named "janeway":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>clear_password</b> <b>janeway</b>

                       This user now cannot log in with a password  (but  may  be  able  to  through  e.g.  SASL
                       EXTERNAL if configured).

               <b>hash_password</b> <u>plaintext</u>

                       <u>plaintext</u>
                               The plaintext password to hash

                       Hashes  a  plaintext  password  according  to  the  currently configured password hashing
                       algorithm

               <b>delete_user</b> <u>username</u>

                       <u>username</u>
                               The name of the user to delete.

                       For example, this command  instructs  the  RabbitMQ  broker  to  delete  the  user  named
                       "janeway":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>delete_user</b> <b>janeway</b>

               <b>list_users</b>

                       Lists  users.   Each result row will contain the user name followed by a list of the tags
                       set for that user.

                       For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to list all users:

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>list_users</b>

               <b>set_user_tags</b> <u>username</u> [<u>tag</u> <u>...</u>]

                       <u>username</u>
                               The name of the user whose tags are to be set.

                       <u>tag</u>     Zero, one or more tags to set.  Any existing tags will be removed.

                       For example, this command  instructs  the  RabbitMQ  broker  to  ensure  the  user  named
                       "janeway" is an administrator:

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>set_user_tags</b> <b>janeway</b> <b>administrator</b>

                       This  has  no  effect  when the user authenticates using a messaging protocol, but can be
                       used to permit the user to manage users, virtual hosts and permissions when the user logs
                       in via some other means (for example with the management plugin).

                       This command instructs the RabbitMQ broker  to  remove  any  tags  from  the  user  named
                       "janeway":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>set_user_tags</b> <b>janeway</b>

   <b>Access</b> <b>control</b>
               <b>clear_permissions</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>] <u>username</u>

                       <u>vhost</u>   The name of the virtual host to which to deny the user access, defaulting to "/".

                       <u>username</u>
                               The name of the user to deny access to the specified virtual host.

                       Sets user permissions.

                       For  example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to deny the user named "janeway"
                       access to the virtual host called "my-vhost":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>clear_permissions</b> <b>-p</b> <b>my-vhost</b> <b>janeway</b>

               <b>clear_topic_permissions</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>] <u>username</u> [<u>exchange</u>]

                       <u>vhost</u>   The name of the virtual host to which to clear the topic permissions,  defaulting
                               to "/".

                       <u>username</u>
                               The name of the user to clear topic permissions to the specified virtual host.

                       <u>exchange</u>
                               The  name of the topic exchange to clear topic permissions, defaulting to all the
                               topic exchanges the given user has topic permissions for.

                       Clear user topic permissions.

                       For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to remove topic  permissions  for
                       the  user  named  "janeway" for the topic exchange "amq.topic" in the virtual host called
                       "my-vhost":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>clear_topic_permissions</b> <b>-p</b> <b>my-vhost</b> <b>janeway</b> <b>amq.topic</b>

               <b>list_permissions</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>]

                       <u>vhost</u>   The name of the virtual host for which to list the users that have  been  granted
                               access to it, and their permissions.  Defaults to "/".

                       Lists permissions in a virtual host.

                       For  example,  this  command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to list all the users who have
                       been granted access to the virtual host called "my-vhost", and the permissions they  have
                       for  operations  on  resources  in that virtual host.  Note that an empty string means no
                       permissions are granted:

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>list_permissions</b> <b>-p</b> <b>my-vhost</b>

               <b>list_topic_permissions</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>]

                               Defaults to "/".

                       Lists topic permissions in a virtual host.

                       For  example,  this  command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to list all the users who have
                       been granted topic permissions in the virtual host called "my-vhost:"

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>list_topic_permissions</b> <b>-p</b> <b>my-vhost</b>

                               The name of the user for which to list the permissions.

                       Lists user permissions.

                       For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to list all the virtual hosts  to
                       which  the user named "janeway" has been granted access, and the permissions the user has
                       for operations on resources in these virtual hosts:

                               The name of the user for which to list the topic permissions.

                       Lists user topic permissions.

                       For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to list all the virtual hosts  to
                       which  the  user  named  "janeway" has been granted access, and the topic permissions the
                       user has in these virtual hosts:

                       The <u>vhostinfoitem</u> parameter is used to indicate which virtual host information  items  to
                       include  in  the  results.   The  column order in the results will match the order of the
                       parameters.  <u>vhostinfoitem</u> can take any value from the list that follows:

                       <b>name</b>    The name of the virtual host with non-ASCII characters escaped as in C.

                       <b>tracing</b>

                       If no <u>vhostinfoitem</u> <u>s</u> are specified then the vhost name is displayed.

                       For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to list all virtual hosts:

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>list_vhosts</b> <b>name</b> <b>tracing</b>

               <b>set_permissions</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>] <u>user</u> <u>conf</u> <u>write</u> <u>read</u>

                               permissions.

                       Sets user permissions.

                       For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to grant the user named "janeway"
                       access to the  virtual  host  called  "my-vhost",  with  configured  permissions  on  all
                       resources  whose  names  start  with  "janeway-",  and  write and read permissions on all
                       resources:

                       <u>conf</u>    A regular expression matching resource  names  for  which  the  user  is  granted
                               configure permissions.

                       <u>write</u>   A  regular expression matching resource names for which the user is granted write
                               permissions.

                       <u>read</u>    A regular expression matching resource names for which the user is  granted  read
                               permissions.

                       Sets user permissions in all vhosts.

                       For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to grant the user named "janeway"
                       access  to  all  virtual  hosts  with  configure permissions on all resources whose names
                       starts with "janeway-", and write and read permissions on all resources:

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>set_permissions_globally</b> <b>janeway</b> "^janeway-.*" ".*" ".*"

               <b>set_topic_permissions</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>] <u>user</u> <u>exchange</u> <u>write</u> <u>read</u>

                       <u>vhost</u>   The name of the virtual host to which to grant the  user  access,  defaulting  to
                               "/".

                       <u>user</u>    The name of the user the permissions apply to in the target virtual host.

                       <u>exchange</u>
                               The name of the topic exchange to which the authorisation check will be applied.

                       <u>write</u>   A regular expression matching the routing key of the published message.

                       <u>read</u>    A regular expression matching the routing key of the consumed message.

                       Sets user topic permissions.

                       For  example,  this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to let the user named "janeway"
                       publish and consume messages going through the "amp.topic"  exchange  of  the  "my-vhost"
                       virtual host with a routing key starting with "janeway-":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b>  <b>set_topic_permissions</b>  <b>-p</b>  <b>my-vhost</b>  <b>janeway</b>  <b>amq.topic</b>  "^janeway-.*"
                             "^janeway-.*"

                       Topic permissions support variable  expansion  for  the  following  variables:  username,
                       vhost, and client_id. Note that client_id is expanded only when using MQTT.  The previous
                       example could be made more generic by using "^{username}-.*":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b>  <b>set_topic_permissions</b>  <b>-p</b>  <b>my-vhost</b> <b>janeway</b> <b>amq.topic</b> "^{username}-.*"

   <b>Monitoring,</b> <b>observability</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> <b>checks</b>
               <b>environment</b>

                       Displays the name and value of each variable in  the  application  environment  for  each

                       The <b>-p</b> flag can be used to override this default.

                       The  <u>bindinginfoitem</u>  parameter  is  used  to indicate which binding information items to
                       include in the results.  The column order in the results will  match  the  order  of  the
                       parameters.  <u>bindinginfoitem</u> can take any value from the list that follows:

                       <b>source_name</b>
                               The  name  of the source of messages to which the binding is attached.  With non-

                               Fraction of the time (between 0.0 and 1.0) that the queue is able to  immediately
                               deliver  messages  to  consumers.   This  can  be  less than 1.0 if consumers are
                               limited by network congestion or prefetch count.

                       <b>memory</b>  Bytes of memory allocated by the runtime for the queue,  including  stack,  heap,
                               and internal structures.

                       <b>mirror_pids</b>
                               If  the queue is mirrored, this lists the IDs of the mirrors (follower replicas).

                       <b>synchronised_mirror_pids</b>
                               If  the  queue is mirrored, this gives the IDs of the mirrors (follower replicas)
                               which are in sync with the leader  replica.  To  learn  more,  see  the  <u>RabbitMQ</u>
                               <u>Mirroring</u> <u>guide</u>: https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/3.13/ha

                       <b>state</b>   The   state   of   the   queue.    Normally  "running",  but  may  be  "{syncing,
                               <u>message_count</u>}" if the queue is synchronising.

                               Queues that are located on cluster nodes that are currently down  will  be  shown
                               with a status of "down" (and most other <u>queueinfoitem</u> will be unavailable).

                       <b>type</b>    Queue type, one of: quorum, stream, classic.

                       If no <u>queueinfoitem</u> <u>s</u> are specified then queue name and depth are displayed.

                       For  example,  this  command displays the depth and number of consumers for each queue of
                       the virtual host named "my-vhost"

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>list_queues</b> <b>-p</b> <b>my-vhost</b> <b>messages</b> <b>consumers</b>

               <b>list_unresponsive_queues</b>   [<b>--local</b>]   [<b>--queue-timeout</b>   <u>milliseconds</u>]    [<u>queueinfoitem</u>    <u>...</u>]
                       [<b>--no-table-headers</b>]

                       Tests queue leader replicas to respond within the given timeout. Lists those that did not
                       respond in time.

                       Displayed  queues  can be filtered by their status or location using one of the following
                       mutually exclusive options:

                       <b>--all</b>   List all queues.

                       <b>--local</b>
                               List only those queues whose leader replica is located on the current node.

                       The <u>queueinfoitem</u> parameter is used to indicate which queue information items to  include
                       in  the results.  The column order in the results will match the order of the parameters.
                       <u>queueinfoitem</u> can take any value from the list that follows:

                       <b>name</b>    The name of the queue with non-ASCII characters escaped as in C.

                       <b>durable</b>
                               Whether or not the queue should survive server restarts.

                       <b>auto_delete</b>
                               Whether the queue will be deleted automatically when all of its explicit bindings
                               are deleted.

                       <b>arguments</b>
                               Queue arguments.

                       <b>policy</b>  Effective policy name for the queue.

                       <b>pid</b>     Erlang process identifier of the leader replica.

                       <b>recoverable_mirrors</b>
                               Erlang process identifiers of the mirror replicas that are  considered  reachable
                               (available).

                       <b>type</b>    Queue type, one of: quorum, stream, classic.

                       For  example,  this  command lists only those unresponsive queues whose leader replica is
                       hosted on the target node.
                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>list_unresponsive_queues</b> <b>--local</b> <b>name</b>

               <b>ping</b>

                       Checks that the node  OS  process  is  up,  registered  with  EPMD,  and  CLI  tools  can
                       authenticate with it

                       Example:
                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>ping</b> <b>-n</b> <b>rabbit@hostname</b>

               <b>report</b>

                       Generate  a  server  status  report  containing  a  concatenation  of  all  server status
                       information for support purposes.  The  output  should  be  redirected  to  a  file  when
                       accompanying a support request.

                       For  example,  this  command  creates  a server report which may be attached to a support
                       request email:

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>report</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>server_report.txt</b>

               <b>schema_info</b> [<b>--no-table-headers</b>] [<u>column</u> <u>...</u>]

                       Lists schema database tables and their properties

                       For example, this command lists the table names and their active replicas:

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>schema_info</b> <b>name</b> <b>active_replicas</b>

               <b>status</b>

                       Displays broker status information such as the running applications on the current Erlang
                       node, RabbitMQ and Erlang versions, OS name, and memory and file  descriptor  statistics.
                       (See the <b>cluster_status</b> command to find out which nodes are clustered and running.)

                       For example, this command displays information about the RabbitMQ broker:

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>status</b>

   <b>Runtime</b> <b>Parameters</b> <b>and</b> <b>Policies</b>
               Certain  features of RabbitMQ (such as the Federation plugin) are controlled by dynamic, cluster-
               wide <u>parameters.</u> There are 2 kinds of parameters: parameters scoped to a virtual host and  global
               parameters.   Each vhost-scoped parameter consists of a component name, a name, and a value.  The
               component name and name are strings, and the value is a valid JSON document.  A global  parameter
               consists  of  a  name  and value.  The name is a string and the value is an arbitrary Erlang data
               structure.  Parameters can be set, cleared, and listed.  In general,  you  should  refer  to  the
               documentation for the feature in question to see how to set parameters.

               Policies  is  a  feature  built  on  top of runtime parameters.  Policies are used to control and
               modify the behaviour of queues and exchanges on a cluster-wide basis.  Policies  apply  within  a
               given  vhost  and consist of a name, pattern, definition, and an optional priority.  Policies can
               be set, cleared, and listed.

               <b>clear_global_parameter</b> <u>name</u>

                       Clears a global runtime parameter.  This is similar to <b>clear_parameter</b> but the  key-value
                       pair isn't tied to a virtual host.

                       <u>name</u>    The name of the global runtime parameter being cleared.

                       For example, this command clears the global runtime parameter "mqtt_default_vhosts":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>clear_global_parameter</b> <b>mqtt_default_vhosts</b>

               <b>clear_parameter</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>] <u>component_name</u> <u>key</u>

                       Clears a parameter.

                       <u>component_name</u>
                               The name of the component for which the parameter is being cleared.

                       <u>name</u>    The name of the parameter being cleared.

                       For  example,  this  command  clears the parameter "node01" for the "federation-upstream"
                       component in the default virtual host:

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>clear_parameter</b> <b>federation-upstream</b> <b>node01</b>

               <b>list_global_parameters</b>

                       Lists all global runtime parameters.  This is similar to <b>list_parameters</b> but  the  global
                       runtime parameters are not tied to any virtual host.

                       For example, this command lists all global parameters:

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>list_global_parameters</b>

               <b>list_parameters</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>]

                       Lists all parameters for a virtual host.

                       For example, this command lists all parameters in the default virtual host:

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>list_parameters</b>

               <b>set_global_parameter</b> <u>name</u> <u>value</u>

                       Sets a global runtime parameter.  This is similar to <b>set_parameter</b> but the key-value pair
                       isn't tied to a virtual host.

                       <u>name</u>    The name of the global runtime parameter being set.

                       <u>value</u>   The  value  for the global runtime parameter, as a JSON document.  In most shells
                               you are very likely to need to quote this.

                       For example, this command sets the global runtime parameter "mqtt_default_vhosts" to  the
                       JSON document {"O=client,CN=guest":"/"}:

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>set_global_parameter</b> <b>mqtt_default_vhosts</b> <b>'{"O=client,CN=guest":"/"}'</b>

               <b>set_parameter</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>] <u>component_name</u> <u>name</u> <u>value</u>

                       Sets a parameter.

                       <u>component_name</u>
                               The name of the component for which the parameter is being set.

                       <u>name</u>    The name of the parameter being set.

                       <u>value</u>   The  value  for  the  parameter, as a JSON document.  In most shells you are very
                               likely to need to quote this.

                       For example, this command sets  the  parameter  "node01"  for  the  "federation-upstream"
                       component in the default virtual host to the following JSON "guest":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b>            <b>set_parameter</b>           <b>federation-upstream</b>           <b>node01</b>
                             <b>'{"uri":"amqp://user:password@server/%2F","ack-mode":"on-publish"}'</b>

               <b>list_policies</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>]

                       Lists all policies for a virtual host.

                       For example, this command lists all policies in the default virtual host:

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>list_policies</b>

               <b>set_operator_policy</b>  [<b>-p</b>  <u>vhost</u>]  [<b>--priority</b>  <u>priority</u>]  [<b>--apply-to</b>  <u>apply-to</u>]   <u>name</u>   <u>pattern</u>
                       <u>definition</u>

                       Sets an operator policy that overrides a subset of arguments in user policies.  Arguments
                       are identical to those of <b>set_policy</b>.

                       Supported arguments are:
                       <b>•</b>   expires
                       <b>•</b>   message-ttl
                       <b>•</b>   max-length
                       <b>•</b>   max-length-bytes

               <b>set_policy</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>] [<b>--priority</b> <u>priority</u>] [<b>--apply-to</b> <u>apply-to</u>] <u>name</u> <u>pattern</u> <u>definition</u>

                       Sets a policy.

                       <u>name</u>    The name of the policy.

                       <u>pattern</u>
                               The regular expression allows the policy to apply if it matches a resource name.

                       <u>definition</u>
                               The  definition  of  the policy, as a JSON document.  In most shells you are very
                               likely to need to quote this.

                       <u>priority</u>
                               The priority of the policy  as  an  integer.   Higher  numbers  indicate  greater
                               precedence.  The default is 0.

                       <u>apply-to</u>
                               Which types of objects this policy should apply to.  Possible values are:
                               <b>•</b>   queues (all queue types, including streams)
                               <b>•</b>   classic_queues (classic queues only)
                               <b>•</b>   quorum_queues (quorum queues only)
                               <b>•</b>   streams (streams only)
                               <b>•</b>   exchanges
                               <b>•</b>   all
                               The default is <b>all</b>.

                       For  example,  this  command sets the policy "federate-me" in the default virtual host so
                       that built-in exchanges are federated:

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>set_policy</b> <b>federate-me</b> <b>^amq.</b> <b>'{"federation-upstream-set":"all"}'</b>

               <b>clear_policy</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>] <u>name</u>

                       Clears a policy.

                       <u>name</u>    The name of the policy being cleared.

                       For example, this command clears the "federate-me" policy in the default virtual host:

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>clear_policy</b> <b>federate-me</b>

               <b>clear_operator_policy</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>] <u>name</u>

                       Clears an operator policy.  Arguments are identical to those of <b>clear_policy</b>.

               <b>list_operator_policies</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>]

                       Lists operator policy overrides for a virtual host.  Arguments are identical to those  of
                       <b>list_policies</b>.

   <b>Virtual</b> <b>hosts</b>
               Note  that  <b>rabbitmqctl</b>  manages the RabbitMQ internal user database.  Permissions for users from
               any alternative authorisation backend will not be visible to <b>rabbitmqctl</b>.

               <b>add_vhost</b> <u>vhost</u> [<b>--description</b> <u>desc</u> <b>--tags</b> <u>tags</u> <b>--default-queue-type</b> <u>default-q-type</u>]

                       <u>vhost</u>   The name of the virtual host entry to create.

                       <u>desc</u>    Arbitrary  virtual  host  description,  e.g.  its  purpose,  for  the  operator's
                               convenience.

                       <u>tags</u>    A comma-separated list of virtual host tags for the operator's convenience.

                       <u>default-q-type</u>
                               If  clients do not specify queue type explicitly, this type will be used. One of:
                               quorum, stream.

                       Creates a virtual host.

                       For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to  create  a  new  virtual  host
                       called "project9_dev_18":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>add_vhost</b> <b>project9_dev_18</b> <b>--description</b> <b>'Dev</b> <b>environment</b> <b>no.</b> <b>18'</b> <b>--tags</b>
                             <b>dev,project9</b>

               <b>clear_vhost_limits</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>]

                       Clears virtual host limits.

                       For example, this command clears vhost limits in vhost "qa_env":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>clear_vhost_limits</b> <b>-p</b> <b>qa_env</b>

               <b>delete_vhost</b> <u>vhost</u>

                       <u>vhost</u>   The name of the virtual host entry to delete.

                       Deletes a virtual host.

                       Deleting  a  virtual  host deletes all its exchanges, queues, bindings, user permissions,
                       parameters, and policies.

                       For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to delete the virtual host called
                       "test":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>delete_vhost</b> <b>a-vhost</b>

               <b>list_vhost_limits</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>] [<b>--global</b>] [<b>--no-table-headers</b>]

                       Displays configured virtual host limits.

                       <b>--global</b>
                               Show limits for all vhosts.  Suppresses the <b>-p</b> parameter.

               <b>restart_vhost</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>vhost</u>]

                       <u>vhost</u>   The name of the virtual host entry to restart, defaulting to "/".

                       Restarts a failed vhost data stores and queues.

                       For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to restart a virtual host  called
                       "test":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>restart_vhost</b> <b>test</b>

                               The  definition  of  the limits, as a JSON document.  In most shells you are very
                               likely to need to quote this.

                               Recognised limits are:

                               Use a negative value to specify "no limit".

                       For example, this command limits the maximum number of concurrent  connections  in  vhost
                       "qa_env" to 64:

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>set_vhost_limits</b> <b>-p</b> <b>qa_env</b> <b>'{"max-connections":</b> <b>64}'</b>

                       This command limits the maximum number of queues in vhost "qa_env" to 256:

               <b>set_cluster_name</b> <u>name</u>

                       Sets the cluster name to <u>name</u>.  The cluster name is announced to clients  on  connection,
                       and  used  by  the federation and shovel plugins to record where a message has been.  The
                       cluster name is by default derived from the hostname of the first node in the cluster but
                       can be changed.

                       For example, this sets the cluster name to "london":

                             <b>rabbitmqctl</b> <b>set_cluster_name</b> <b>london</b>

               <b>set_disk_free_limit</b> <u>disk_limit</u>

                               (see  vm_memory_high_watermark),  e.g.  512M or 1G.  Once free disk space reaches
                               the limit, a disk alarm will be set.

               <b>set_disk_free_limit</b> <b>mem_relative</b> <u>fraction</u>

                       <u>fraction</u>
