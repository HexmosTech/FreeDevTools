       <b>ifcico</b> <b>tsync</b> | <b>yoohoo</b> | <b>**EMSI_INQC816</b>

       (this implies slave mode)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Ifcico</b>  stands  for  "Internet  -  Fidonet Copy In / Copy Out", this is a FidoNet(r) compatible transport
       agent.  Currently it supports FTS-0001, YooHoo/2U2  and  EMSI  handshake  protocols,  Xmodem  (untested),
       Telink  (untested),  Modem7  (untested),  SEAlink  w/overdrive  and  crash recovery, Bark file and update
       requests, WaZOO protocols: DietIFNA, plain Zmodem (aka ZedZip, EMSI flag "ZMO"), ZedZap and Hydra,  WaZOO
       file  and  update requests (nodelist flag should be XA). Password protected requests are not implemented.
       There are plans to implement Janus protocol in the future.

       There is also a special protocol optimized to  use  over  TCP/IP  connection,  contributed  by  Stanislav
       Voronyi &lt;<a href="mailto:stas@uanet.kharkov.ua">stas@uanet.kharkov.ua</a>&gt;, it is identified by EMSI proto code TCP (not registered).

       Outbound  directory structure is BinkleyTerm compatible, with domains and point subdirectories (full 5d).
       There are separate "listed" and "protected" inbound directories for the incoming sessions with the  nodes
       present  in  the  nodelist(s)  and with nodes that have a password assigned respectively.  Files received
       during an outbound session are always put into the "protected" directory. (Only "protected" directory  is
       looked up by ifunpack by default).

       "Magic" file request processors are executable files placed in the "magic" directory.  If request is made
       for  a  file with matching name, the executable from the "magic" directory is run, and its stdout sent to
       the requester.  Full requester's address, in the form  "John  Smith  of  1:234/56.7"  is  passed  to  the
       executable  in  the  command  line.   See "misc/FILES" for an example of a magic request processor.  Non-
       executable files in the "magic" directory are "references".  If  a  request  is  made  for  a  file  with
       matching name, the file is read line by line, and request re-made for the name found in each line.  Up to
       5 levels of recursion are allowed.

       To  run <u>ifcico</u> in master mode, you must make dialout devices read/writable for <u>ifcico,</u> -B and do the same
       for the directory where your uucp locks are created (usually <a href="file:/var/lock/">/var/lock/</a>).

       To make <u>ifcico</u> work in answer mode, you need an FTN-able getty.   Linux  "standard"  <u>getty_ps</u>,  and  Gert
       Doering's  <u>mgetty</u>  (from  the  <u>mgetty+sendfax</u>  package) and later versions have fidonet support built-in.
       Getty must distinguish incoming FidoNet type calls, and start <u>ifcico</u> with one parameter:

       FTS-0001 call:   "ifcico tsync"
       FTS-0006 call:   "ifcico yoohoo"
       EMSI call:       "ifcico **EMSI_....."

       (in the latter case the received EMSI packet should be passed without trailing CR).

       If you are using <u>getty_ps,</u> don't forget to create the file /etc/default/uugetty with the contents similar
       to the following (case sensitive):

       FIDO=/usr/local/lib/fnet/ifcico
       EMSI=yes

       When called without parameters, <u>ifcico</u> runs in slave mode and determines  the  type  of  inbound  session
       itself.  This mode may be used when <u>ifcico</u> runs as an internet or ISDN daemon.

       To  make  <u>ifcico</u>  scan  for pending outbound mail and do appropriate calls, start it with "-r1" flag.  To
       force polling of particular nodes, specify these nodes in the command line (addresses should be in domain
       notation, e.g.  "ifcico f23.n5020 f155.n5020").  The latter implies master mode (-r1).  Note that  "hold"
       packets and files, as well as file requests, do not cause the node to be polled.

       Inbound  directory is created automatically if it does not exist, along with the "tmp" subdir. The latter
       is used while receiving files. After being successfully received, the files are moved up to the "inbound"
       directory.  "protinbound" and "listinbound" directories accept files received during  password  protected
       sessions and session with the nodes present in the nodelist(s) respectively.

       <u>Ifcico</u>  can  use text format nodelists in original (MS/DOS) form with &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;'s as well as in UNIX form,
       with &lt;LF&gt;'s only.  When you get a fresh nodelist, or change the "nodelist" statements in the config file,
       you must rebuild index with <u>ifindex</u> program.

       For outgoing calls, status files are created for nodes, with the extention ".sts".  These are ascii files
       containg three decimal numbers in a single line:

       <b>time</b> <b>retries</b> <b>code</b>

       <b>time</b> is the last call attempt time (attempts failing with "retry time not reached" do not count).  It  is
       unsigned long representing the number of seconds since the epoch.
       <b>retries</b>  is  the  number  of  consequitve  call  attempts  made that returned "call failed" or "could not
       establish session".  This field is zeroed when call succeeds.
       <b>code</b> is the return code of the last attempt.

       <u>nlpatch</u> program compiles a new version of the nodelist from the old nodelist and nodediff.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>      Display a short help message.

       <b>-x</b> <b>Verbosity</b>      Set the debug verbosity <b>Verbosity</b> may be a number from 0 to 32 to set 'on' bits from  1
       to number, or a string of letters where 'a' = bit 1, 'b' = bit 2, etc. up to bit 26.

       <b>-I</b> <b>File</b>      Use the alternate configuration file <b>File.</b>

       <b>-r</b> <b>Role</b>      1 - master, 0 - slave. default is 0 (slave mode) if no <b>node</b> is provided; else the default is
       1 (master mode).

       <b>-a</b> <b>Inetaddr</b>      Tell an internet address <b>Inetaddr</b> to make a connection by TCP/IP. A specific port can be
       given ( <b>-a</b> <b>Inetaddr:Port</b> ).  The default is the one given by <b>fido</b> in <b>/etc/services.</b>

       <b>-t</b> <b>Mode</b>      0 - TCP, 1 - Telnet-Vmodem. Tells the mode to use for TCP/IP connections, the default is TCP
       mode (-t0)

       <b>-n</b> <b>Phone</b>
               For modem conections, this overrides the phone number given in the nodelist

       <b>-l</b> <b>TtyDevice</b>
               For modem connections, this overrides the tty value give in the config file

       <b>Node</b>        This   is  the  FTN  addres  of  the  node  to  call.  The  addres  must  be  in  the  format
       "[pNN.]fNN.nNN[.zNN[.domain]]".

       <b>tsync</b> | <b>yoohoo</b> | <b>**EMSI_INQC816</b>      Those values are typically given by an FTN-able getty  (  <b>mgetty</b>  or
       <b>getty_ps</b> ), they determine the type of FTN protocol to use. They imply slave mode.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>ifcico</u> returns maximum return code for all calls made. Codes are as follows:

       0     Successfull call
       1     Dialout port unavailable
       2     Dial failed (no "CONNECT" or TCP connection failed)
       3     Could not reset the modem (no "OK")
       4     System locked
       5     Retry time not reached
       6     Fatal error in nodelist lookup
       7     Call prohibited by config options
       8     Phone number unavailable
       9     No matching ports defined
       10    Unused
       &gt;10   Session failures (not defined yet)
       30    Could not establish session

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$IFLIBDIR/config</b>
                   Runtime configuration file.

       <b><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></b>
                   Determines the default port number for <b>fido,</b> the port used by ifcico for tcp connections.

       <b>nodelist.???</b>
                   A list of nodes in an FTN network.  <u>ifcico</u> uses it by compiling it with <b>ifindex</b>

       <b>$BINDIR/ifindex</b>
                   compiles a nodelist so <u>ifcico</u> can use it.

       <b>$BINDIR/ifstat</b>
                   show statistics of calls, etc.
