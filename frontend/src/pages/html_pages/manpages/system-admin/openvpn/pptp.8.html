</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pptp - PPTP driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pptp</b> <u>&lt;pptp-server-IP&gt;</u> <u>&lt;pptp-options&gt;</u> <u>[ppp-options]</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pptp</b>  establishes  the  client side of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) using the Point-to-Point Tunneling
       Protocol (PPTP).  Use this program to connect to an employer's PPTP based VPN, or to  certain  cable  and
       ADSL service providers.

       By  default,  <b>pptp</b>  establishes  the PPTP call to the PPTP server, and then starts an instance of <b>pppd</b> to
       manage the data transfer.  However, <b>pptp</b> can also be run as a connection manager within <b>pppd</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The first non-option argument on the <b>pptp</b> command line must be the host name or IP address  of  the  PPTP
       server.

       All  long  options  (starting  with "--") are interpreted as pptp options, and a fatal error occurs if an
       unrecognised option is used.

       All command-line arguments which do not start with "-" are interpreted as ppp options, and passed  as  is
       to <b>pppd</b> unless <b>--nolaunchpppd</b> is given.

       <b>--phone</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b>
              Pass &lt;number&gt; to remote host as phone number

       <b>--nolaunchpppd</b>
              Do  not launch <b>pppd</b> but use stdin as the network connection.  Use this flag when including <b>pptp</b> as
              a <b>pppd</b> connection process using the <b>pty</b> option.  See EXAMPLES.

       <b>--quirks</b> <b>&lt;quirk&gt;</b>
              Work around a buggy PPTP implementation, adopts special case handling for particular PPTP  servers
              and ADSL modems.  Currently recognised values are BEZEQ_ISRAEL only

       <b>--debug</b>
              Run in foreground (for debugging with gdb)

       <b>--sync</b> Enable Synchronous HDLC (pppd must use it too)

       <b>--timeout</b> <b>&lt;secs&gt;</b>
              Time to wait for reordered packets (0.01 to 10 secs)

       <b>--nobuffer</b>
              Completely disables buffering and reordering of packets.  Any --timeout specified will be ignored.

       <b>--idle-wait</b> <b>&lt;secs&gt;</b>
              Time to wait before sending a control connection echo request.  The RFC2637 default is 60 seconds.

       <b>--max-echo-wait</b> <b>&lt;secs&gt;</b>
              Time  to  wait for an echo reply before closing the control connection.  The RFC2637 default is 60
              seconds.

       <b>--logstring</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Use &lt;name&gt; instead of 'anon' in syslog messages

       <b>--localbind</b> <b>&lt;addr&gt;</b>
              Bind to specified IP address instead of wildcard

       <b>--rtmark</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Use specified policy routing mark for all packets.  This causes both the TCP control  connection's
              packets  as well as the GRE packets to bear the given policy routing / netfilter mark. This can be
              used with <u>ip</u> <u>rule</u> (from iproute2) to use a separate routing table for the pptp client.

              (requires root privileges or the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.)

       <b>--nohostroute</b>
              Do not configure a host route pointing towards the PPTP server.  (cf. ROUTING below)

       <b>--loglevel</b> <b>&lt;level&gt;</b>
              Sets the debugging level (0=low, 1=default, 2=high)

       <b>--test-type</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Enable packet reordering tests that damage the integrity of the packet stream to the server.   Use
              this  only  when  testing  servers.   Zero  is the default, and means that packets are sent in the
              correct order.  A value of one (1) causes a  single  swap  between  two  packets,  such  that  the
              sequence  numbers  might  be  1  2  3  4  6  5 7 8 9.  A value of two (2) causes ten packets to be
              buffered, then sent out of order but ascending, such that the sequence numbers might be 1 2 3 4 16
              6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 17 18 19 20.  A value of three (3) causes ten packets  to  be  buffered,
              then sent in the reverse order, like this; 1 2 3 4 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 17 18 19 20.

       <b>--test-rate</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Sets  the  number  of  packets  to pass before causing a reordering test.  Default is 100.  Has no
              effect if test-type is zero.  The result of test types 2 and 3 are undefined if this value is less
              than ten.

       <b>--missing-window</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Enable 'missing window' validation and set packet tolerance (300=default, 6000=recommended).

       <b>--version</b>
              Display version.

</pre><h4><b>ROUTING</b></h4><pre>
       When PPTP is used in conjunction with  a  default  route  on  top  of  the  tunnel  (or  just  any  route
       encompassing  the  PPTP  server),  the mechanics of routing would cause the PPTP packets themselves to be
       routed over the tunnel. This would result in an encapsulation loop, destroying connectivity.

       <b>pptp</b> by default works around this by looking up  the  route  towards  the  PPTP  server  at  startup  and
       configures  a  host  route  with  that  data.  This essentially "freezes" routing for PPTP packets at the
       startup configuration. This behaviour can be disabled with <b>--nohostroute</b> if undesired  (like  when  using
       <b>--rtmark</b> to implement policy routing).

       <b>NB:</b> the route added by <b>pptp</b> is currently not deleted at exit!

</pre><h4><b>QUIRKS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BEZEQ_ISRAEL</b>
              modifies packets to interoperate with Orckit ADSL modems on the BEZEQ network in Israel.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Connection</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>VPN</b> <b>Server</b>

       pppd  noauth  nobsdcomp  nodeflate  require-mppe-128  name  domain\\\\username  remotename PPTP pty "pptp
       10.0.0.5 --nolaunchpppd"

       Note that the <b>chap-secrets</b> file used by <b>pppd</b> must include an entry for domain\\username

</pre><h4><b>STATISTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The pptp process collects statistics when sending and receiving GRE packets.  They  are  intended  to  be
       useful for debugging poor PPTP performance and for general monitoring of link quality. The statistics are
       cumulative since the pptp process was started.

       The  statistics can be viewed by sending a SIGUSR1 signal to the "GRE-to-PPP Gateway" process, which will
       cause it to dump them to the system logs  (at  the  LOG_NOTICE  level).  A  better  way  to  present  the
       statistics to applications is being sought (e.g. SNMP?).

       The following statistics are collected at the time of writing (April 2003):

       <b>rx</b> <b>accepted</b>
              the number of GRE packets successfully passed to PPP

       <b>rx</b> <b>lost</b>
              the number of packets never received, and presumed lost in the network

       <b>rx</b> <b>under</b> <b>win</b>
              the number of packets which were duplicates or had old sequence numbers (this might be caused by a
              packet-reordering network if your reordering timeout is set too low)

       <b>rx</b> <b>over</b> <b>win</b>
              the number of packets which were too far ahead in the sequence to be reordered (might be caused by
              loss of more than 300 packets in a row)

       <b>rx</b> <b>buffered</b>
              the  number  of  packets  which  were  slightly  ahead  of  sequence, and were either buffered for
              reordering, or if buffering is disabled,  accepted  immediately  (resulting  in  the  intermediate
              packets being discarded).

       <b>rx</b> <b>OS</b> <b>errors</b>
              the number of times where the operating system reported an error when we tried to read a packet

       <b>rx</b> <b>truncated</b>
              the  number  of  times  we  received a packet which was shorter than the length implied by the GRE
              header

       <b>rx</b> <b>invalid</b>
              the number of times we received a packet which had invalid or unsupported flags set in the header,
              wrong version, or wrong protocol.

       <b>rx</b> <b>acks</b>
              the number of pure acknowledgements  received  (without  data).  Too  many  of  these  will  waste
              bandwidth, and might be solved by tuning the remote host.

       <b>tx</b> <b>sent</b>
              the number of GRE packets sent with data

       <b>tx</b> <b>failed</b>
              the number of packets we tried to send, but the OS reported an error

       <b>tx</b> <b>short</b>
              the number of times the OS would not let us write a complete packet

       <b>tx</b> <b>acks</b>
              the number of times we sent a pure ack, without data

       <b>tx</b> <b>oversize</b>
              the number of times we couldn't send a packet because it was over PACKET_MAX bytes long

       <b>round</b> <b>trip</b>
              the estimated round-trip time in milliseconds
