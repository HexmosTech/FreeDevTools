       openvpn - Secure IP tunnel daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>openvpn</b> [ options ... ]
       <b>openvpn</b>  <b>--help</b>

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       OpenVPN  is  an  open  source VPN daemon by James Yonan. Because OpenVPN tries to be a universal VPN tool
       offering a great deal of flexibility, there are a lot of options on this manual page. If  you're  new  to
       OpenVPN,  you might want to skip ahead to the examples section where you will see how to construct simple
       VPNs on the command line without even needing a configuration file.

       Also note that there's more documentation and examples on the OpenVPN web site: <u>https://openvpn.net/</u>

       And if you would like to see a shorter version of this manual, see the openvpn usage message which can be
       obtained by running <b>openvpn</b> without any parameters.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       OpenVPN is a robust and highly flexible VPN daemon. OpenVPN supports SSL/TLS security, ethernet bridging,
       TCP or UDP tunnel transport  through  proxies  or  NAT,  support  for  dynamic  IP  addresses  and  DHCP,
       scalability to hundreds or thousands of users, and portability to most major OS platforms.

       OpenVPN is tightly bound to the OpenSSL library, and derives much of its crypto capabilities from it.

       OpenVPN  supports  conventional  encryption using a pre-shared secret key <b>(Static</b> <b>Key</b> <b>mode)</b> or public key
       security <b>(SSL/TLS</b> <b>mode)</b> using client &amp; server certificates. OpenVPN also supports  non-encrypted  TCP/UDP
       tunnels.

       OpenVPN is designed to work with the <b>TUN/TAP</b> virtual networking interface that exists on most platforms.

       Overall,  OpenVPN  aims  to  offer  many  of  the key features of IPSec but with a relatively lightweight
       footprint.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       OpenVPN allows any option to be placed either on the command line or in a configuration file. Though  all
       command  line  options  are  preceded by a double-leading-dash ("--"), this prefix can be removed when an
       option is placed in a configuration file.

   <b>Generic</b> <b>Options</b>
       This section covers generic options which are accessible regardless of which mode OpenVPN  is  configured
       as.

       <b>--help</b> Show options.

       <b>--auth-nocache</b>
              Don't cache <b>--askpass</b> or <b>--auth-user-pass</b> username/passwords in virtual memory.

              If  specified,  this  directive  will cause OpenVPN to immediately forget username/password inputs
              after they are used. As a result, when OpenVPN needs a username/password, it will prompt for input
              from stdin, which may be multiple times during the duration of an OpenVPN session.

              When using <b>--auth-nocache</b> in combination with a user/password file and <b>--chroot</b> or <b>--daemon</b>,  make
              sure to use an absolute path.

              This directive does not affect the <b>--http-proxy</b> username/password.  It is always cached.

       <b>--cd</b> <u>dir</u>
              Change  directory  to  <b>dir</b>  prior  to  reading  any  files such as configuration files, key files,
              scripts, etc. <b>dir</b> should be an absolute path, with a leading "/", and without  any  references  to
              the current directory such as <b>.</b> or <b>..</b>.

              This  option  is useful when you are running OpenVPN in <b>--daemon</b> mode, and you want to consolidate
              all of your OpenVPN control files in one location.

       <b>--chroot</b> <u>dir</u>
              Chroot to <b>dir</b> after initialization. <b>--chroot</b> essentially redefines <b>dir</b>  as  being  the  top  level
              directory  tree  (/). OpenVPN will therefore be unable to access any files outside this tree. This
              can be desirable from a security standpoint.

              Since the chroot operation is delayed  until  after  initialization,  most  OpenVPN  options  that
              reference files will operate in a pre-chroot context.

              In many cases, the <b>dir</b> parameter can point to an empty directory, however complications can result
              when scripts or restarts are executed after the chroot operation.

              Note:  The SSL library will probably need /dev/urandom to be available inside the chroot directory
              <b>dir</b>. This is because SSL libraries occasionally need to  collect  fresh  randomness.  Newer  linux
              kernels  and  some  BSDs implement a getrandom() or getentropy() syscall that removes the need for
              /dev/urandom to be available.

       <b>--compat-mode</b> <u>version</u>
              This option provides a convenient way to alter the defaults of OpenVPN to be more compatible  with
              the  version  <b>version</b> specified. All of the changes this option applies can also be achieved using
              individual configuration options.

              The version specified with this option is the version of OpenVPN peer OpenVPN  should  try  to  be
              compatible  with.  In  general  OpenVPN  should  be  compatible with the last two previous version
              without this option. E.g.  OpenVPN 2.6.0 should be compatible with 2.5.x and  2.4.x  without  this
              option.   However,  there  might  be  some edge cases that still require this option even in these
              cases.

              Note: Using this option reverts defaults to no longer recommended values and should be avoided  if
              possible.

              The following table details what defaults are changed depending on the version specified.

              • 2.5.x or lower: <b>--allow-compression</b> <b>asym</b> is automatically added to the configuration if no other
                compression options are present.

              • 2.4.x or lower: The cipher in <b>--cipher</b> is appended to <b>--data-ciphers</b>.

              • 2.3.x or lower: <b>--data-ciphers-fallback</b> is automatically added with the same cipher as <b>--cipher</b>.

              • 2.3.6  or  lower:  <b>--tls-version-min</b> <b>1.0</b> is added to the configuration when <b>--tls-version-min</b> is
                not explicitly set.

              If not required, this is option should be avoided. Setting  this  option  can  lower  security  or
              disable features like data-channel offloading.

       <b>--config</b> <u>file</u>
              Load  additional  config options from <b>file</b> where each line corresponds to one command line option,
              but with the leading <b>--</b> removed.

              If <b>--config</b> <b>file</b> is the only option to the openvpn command, the <b>--config</b> can be removed,  and  the
              command can be given as <b>openvpn</b> <b>file</b>

              Note that configuration files can be nested to a reasonable depth.

              Double  quotation or single quotation characters ("", '') can be used to enclose single parameters
              containing whitespace, and "#" or ";" characters in  the  first  column  can  be  used  to  denote
              comments.

              Note  that  OpenVPN  2.0  and higher performs backslash-based shell escaping for characters not in
              single quotations, so the following mappings should be observed:

                 \\       Maps to a single backslash character (\).
                 \"       Pass a literal doublequote character ("), don't
                          interpret it as enclosing a parameter.
                 \[SPACE] Pass a literal space or tab character, don't
                          interpret it as a parameter delimiter.

              For example on Windows, use double backslashes to represent pathnames:

                 secret "c:\\OpenVPN\\secret.key"

              For examples of configuration files, see <u>https://openvpn.net/community-resources/how-to/</u>

              Here is an example configuration file:

                 #
                 # Sample OpenVPN configuration file for
                 # using a pre-shared static key.
                 #
                 # '#' or ';' may be used to delimit comments.

                 # Use a dynamic tun device.
                 dev tun

                 # Our remote peer
                 remote mypeer.mydomain

                 # 10.1.0.1 is our local VPN endpoint
                 # 10.1.0.2 is our remote VPN endpoint
                 ifconfig 10.1.0.1 10.1.0.2

                 # Our pre-shared static key
                 secret static.key

       <b>--daemon</b> <u>progname</u>
              Become a daemon after all initialization functions are completed.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 daemon
                 daemon progname

              This option will cause all message and error output to  be  sent  to  the  syslog  file  (such  as
              <b>/var/log/messages</b>),  except  for  the  output  of  scripts and ifconfig commands, which will go to
              <b>/dev/null</b> unless otherwise redirected. The syslog redirection occurs immediately at the point that
              <b>--daemon</b> is parsed on the command line even though the daemonization point occurs later. If one of
              the <b>--log</b> options is present, it will supersede syslog redirection.

              The optional <b>progname</b> parameter will cause OpenVPN to report its program name to the system logger
              as <b>progname</b>. This can be useful in linking OpenVPN messages  in  the  syslog  file  with  specific
              tunnels. When unspecified, <b>progname</b> defaults to <b>openvpn</b>.

              When  OpenVPN  is  run  with  the  <b>--daemon</b>  option,  it will try to delay daemonization until the
              majority of initialization functions which are capable of generating fatal  errors  are  complete.
              This  means  that  initialization  scripts can test the return status of the openvpn command for a
              fairly reliable indication of whether the command has correctly initialized and entered the packet
              forwarding event loop.

              In OpenVPN, the vast majority of errors which occur after initialization are non-fatal.

              Note: as soon as OpenVPN has daemonized, it can not ask for  usernames,  passwords,  or  key  pass
              phrases anymore. This has certain consequences, namely that using a password-protected private key
              will  fail  unless  the  <b>--askpass</b> option is used to tell OpenVPN to ask for the pass phrase (this
              requirement is new in v2.3.7, and is a consequence of calling  daemon()  before  initializing  the
              crypto layer).

              Further,  using  <b>--daemon</b>  together  with <b>--auth-user-pass</b> (entered on console) and <b>--auth-nocache</b>
              will fail as soon as key renegotiation (and reauthentication) occurs.

       <b>--disable-dco</b>
              Disable "data channel offload" (DCO).

              On Linux don't use the ovpn-dco device driver, but rather rely on the legacy tun module.

              You may want to use this option if your server needs to allow clients older than  version  2.4  to
              connect.

       <b>--disable-occ</b>
              <b>DEPRECATED</b> Disable "options consistency check" (OCC) in configurations that do not use TLS.

              Don't output a warning message if option inconsistencies are detected between peers. An example of
              an  option  inconsistency  would  be where one peer uses <b>--dev</b> <b>tun</b> while the other peer uses <b>--dev</b>
              <b>tap</b>.

              Use of this option is discouraged, but is provided as a temporary fix in situations where a recent
              version of OpenVPN must connect to an old version.

       <b>--engine</b> <u>engine-name</u>
              Enable OpenSSL hardware-based crypto engine functionality.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 engine
                 engine engine-name

              If <b>engine-name</b> is specified, use a specific  crypto  engine.  Use  the  <b>--show-engines</b>  standalone
              option to list the crypto engines which are supported by OpenSSL.

       <b>--fast-io</b>
              (Experimental)  Optimize  TUN/TAP/UDP  I/O writes by avoiding a call to poll/epoll/select prior to
              the write operation. The purpose of such a call would normally be to block  until  the  device  or
              socket  is  ready  to accept the write. Such blocking is unnecessary on some platforms which don't
              support write blocking on UDP sockets or TUN/TAP devices. In such  cases,  one  can  optimize  the
              event loop by avoiding the poll/epoll/select call, improving CPU efficiency by 5% to 10%.

              This  option  can  only  be  used  on non-Windows systems, when <b>--proto</b> <b>udp</b> is specified, and when
              <b>--shaper</b> is <u>NOT</u> specified.

       <b>--group</b> <u>group</u>
              Similar to the <b>--user</b> option, this option changes the group ID of the  OpenVPN  process  to  <b>group</b>
              after initialization.

       <b>--ignore-unknown-option</b> <u>args</u>
              Valid syntax:

                 ignore-unknown-options opt1 opt2 opt3 ... optN

              When  one of options <b>opt1</b> <b>...</b> <b>optN</b> is encountered in the configuration file the configuration file
              parsing  does  not  fail  if  this  OpenVPN  version  does  not  support  the   option.   Multiple
              <b>--ignore-unknown-option</b> options can be given to support a larger number of options to ignore.

              This  option  should  be  used with caution, as there are good security reasons for having OpenVPN
              fail if it detects problems in a config file.  Having said  that,  there  are  valid  reasons  for
              wanting new software features to gracefully degrade when encountered by older software versions.

              <b>--ignore-unknown-option</b> is available since OpenVPN 2.3.3.

       <b>--iproute</b> <u>cmd</u>
              Set  alternate  command  to  execute instead of default <b>iproute2</b> command.  May be used in order to
              execute OpenVPN in unprivileged environment.

       <b>--keying-material-exporter</b> <u>args</u>
              Save Exported Keying Material [RFC5705] of <b>len</b> bytes (must be between 16  and  4095  bytes)  using
              <b>label</b>  in  environment  (<b>exported_keying_material</b>)  for use by plugins in <b>OPENVPN_PLUGIN_TLS_FINAL</b>
              callback.

              Valid syntax:

                 keying-material-exporter label len

              Note that exporter <b>labels</b> have the potential to collide with existing  PRF  labels.  In  order  to
              prevent this, labels <u>MUST</u> begin with <b>EXPORTER</b>.

       <b>--mlock</b>
              Disable  paging  by calling the POSIX mlockall function. Requires that OpenVPN be initially run as
              root (though OpenVPN can subsequently downgrade its UID using the <b>--user</b> option).

              Using this option ensures that key material and tunnel data are  never  written  to  disk  due  to
              virtual  memory paging operations which occur under most modern operating systems. It ensures that
              even if an attacker was able to crack the box running OpenVPN, he would not be able  to  scan  the
              system  swap  file  to recover previously used ephemeral keys, which are used for a period of time
              governed by the <b>--reneg</b> options (see below), then are discarded.

              The downside of using <b>--mlock</b> is that it will reduce the amount of physical  memory  available  to
              other applications.

              The  limit  on  how  much memory can be locked and how that limit is enforced are OS-dependent. On
              Linux the default limit that an unprivileged process may lock  (RLIMIT_MEMLOCK)  is  low,  and  if
              privileges  are  dropped  later, future memory allocations will very likely fail. The limit can be
              increased using ulimit or systemd directives depending on how OpenVPN is started.

              If the platform has the <a href="../man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit</a>(2) system call, OpenVPN will check for the amount of  mlock-able
              memory  before calling <a href="../man2/mlockall.2.html">mlockall</a>(2), and tries to increase the limit to 100 MB if less than this is
              configured.  100 Mb  is  somewhat  arbitrary  -  it  is  enough  for  a  moderately-sized  OpenVPN
              deployment, but the memory usage might go beyond that if the number of concurrent clients is high.

       <b>--nice</b> <u>n</u>
              Change process priority after initialization (<b>n</b> greater than 0 is lower priority, <b>n</b> less than zero
              is higher priority).

       <b>--persist-key</b>
              Don't re-read key files across <b>SIGUSR1</b> or <b>--ping-restart</b>.

              This  option  can  be  combined  with  <b>--user</b>  to  allow restarts triggered by the <b>SIGUSR1</b> signal.
              Normally if you drop root privileges in OpenVPN, the daemon cannot be restarted since it will  now
              be unable to re-read protected key files.

              This  option solves the problem by persisting keys across <b>SIGUSR1</b> resets, so they don't need to be
              re-read.

       <b>--providers</b> <u>providers</u>
              Load the list of (OpenSSL) providers. This is mainly useful for using an external provider for key
              management like tpm2-openssl or to load the legacy provider with

                 --providers legacy default

              Behaviour of changing this option between <b>SIGHUP</b> might not be  well  behaving.   If  you  need  to
              change/add/remove this option, fully restart OpenVPN.

       <b>--remap-usr1</b> <u>signal</u>
              Control whether internally or externally generated <b>SIGUSR1</b> signals are remapped to <b>SIGHUP</b> (restart
              without persisting state) or <b>SIGTERM</b> (exit).

              <b>signal</b> can be set to <b>SIGHUP</b> or <b>SIGTERM</b>. By default, no remapping occurs.

       <b>--script-security</b> <u>level</u>
              This  directive offers policy-level control over OpenVPN's usage of external programs and scripts.
              Lower <b>level</b> values are more restrictive, higher values are more permissive. Settings for <b>level</b>:

              <b>0</b>      Strictly no calling of external programs.

              <b>1</b>      (Default) Only call built-in executables such as ifconfig, ip, route, or netsh.

              <b>2</b>      Allow calling of built-in executables and user-defined scripts.

              <b>3</b>      Allow passwords to be passed to scripts via environmental variables (potentially unsafe).

              OpenVPN releases before v2.3 also supported a <b>method</b> flag which indicated how OpenVPN should  call
              external commands and scripts. This could be either <b>execve</b> or <b>system</b>. As of OpenVPN 2.3, this flag
              is  no  longer accepted. In most *nix environments the execve() approach has been used without any
              issues.

              Some directives such as <b>--up</b> allow options to be passed to the external  script.  In  these  cases
              make  sure  the  script  name  does  not contain any spaces or the configuration parser will choke
              because it can't determine where the script name ends and script options start.

              To run scripts in Windows in earlier OpenVPN versions you needed to either add a full path to  the
              script  interpreter  which can parse the script or use the <b>system</b> flag to run these scripts. As of
              OpenVPN 2.3 it is now a strict requirement to have  full  path  to  the  script  interpreter  when
              running  non-executables  files. This is not needed for executable files, such as .exe, .com, .bat
              or .cmd files. For example, if you have a Visual Basic script, you must use this syntax now:

                 --up 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\wscript.exe C:\\Program\ Files\\OpenVPN\\config\\my-up-script.vbs'

              Please note the single quote marks  and  the  escaping  of  the  backslashes  (\)  and  the  space
              character.

              The  reason  the  support for the <b>system</b> flag was removed is due to the security implications with
              shell expansions when executing scripts via the <b>system()</b> call.

       <b>--setcon</b> <u>context</u>
              Apply SELinux <b>context</b> after initialization. This essentially  provides  the  ability  to  restrict
              OpenVPN's  rights to only network I/O operations, thanks to SELinux. This goes further than <b>--user</b>
              and <b>--chroot</b> in that those two, while being great security features, unfortunately do not  protect
              against  privilege  escalation  by  exploitation  of  a  vulnerable system call. You can of course
              combine all three, but please note that since setcon requires access to <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a>  you  will  have  to
              provide it inside the chroot directory (e.g. with mount --bind).

              Since  the  setcon  operation  is delayed until after initialization, OpenVPN can be restricted to
              just network-related system calls, whereas by applying the context before  startup  (such  as  the
              OpenVPN  one  provided  in  the  SELinux  Reference  Policies)  you will have to allow many things
              required only during initialization.

              Like with chroot, complications can result when scripts or restarts are executed after the  setcon
              operation,  which  is  why  you  should  really consider using the <b>--persist-key</b> and <b>--persist-tun</b>
              options.

       <b>--status</b> <u>args</u>
              Write operational status to <b>file</b> every <b>n</b> seconds. <b>n</b> defaults to <b>60</b> if not specified.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 status file
                 status file n

              Status can also be written to the syslog by sending a <b>SIGUSR2</b> signal.

              With multi-client capability enabled on a server, the status file includes a list of clients and a
              routing table. The output format can be controlled by the <b>--status-version</b> option in that case.

              For clients or instances running in point-to-point mode, it will contain the traffic statistics.

       <b>--status-version</b> <u>n</u>
              Set the status file format version number to <b>n</b>.

              This only affects the status file on servers with multi-client capability enabled.   Valid  status
              version values:

              <b>1</b>      Traditional   format   (default).   The   client   list   contains   the  following  fields
                     comma-separated: Common Name, Real Address, Bytes Received, Bytes Sent, Connected Since.

              <b>2</b>      A more reliable format for external processing. Compared to  version  <b>1</b>,  the  client  list
                     contains  some  additional  fields: Virtual Address, Virtual IPv6 Address, Username, Client
                     ID, Peer ID, Data Channel Cipher. Future versions may extend the number of fields.

              <b>3</b>      Identical to <b>2</b>, but fields are tab-separated.

       <b>--test-crypto</b>
              Do a self-test of OpenVPN's crypto options by encrypting and decrypting  test  packets  using  the
              data channel encryption options specified above.  This option does not require a peer to function,
              and therefore can be specified without <b>--dev</b> or <b>--remote</b>.

              The typical usage of <b>--test-crypto</b> would be something like this:

                 openvpn --test-crypto --secret key

              or

                 openvpn --test-crypto --secret key --verb 9

              This  option  is  very  useful  to  test OpenVPN after it has been ported to a new platform, or to
              isolate problems in the compiler, OpenSSL crypto library, or OpenVPN's crypto code. Since it is  a
              self-test  mode,  problems  with  encryption  and  authentication can be debugged independently of
              network and tunnel issues.

       <b>--tmp-dir</b> <u>dir</u>
              Specify a directory <b>dir</b> for temporary files. This directory will be used by openvpn processes  and
              script  to  communicate  temporary data with openvpn main process. Note that the directory must be
              writable by the OpenVPN process after it has dropped it's root privileges.

              This directory will be used by in the following cases:

              • <b>--client-connect</b> scripts and <b>OPENVPN_PLUGIN_CLIENT_CONNECT</b> plug-in hook to dynamically  generate
                client-specific   configuration   <b>client_connect_config_file</b>   and  return  success/failure  via
                <b>client_connect_deferred_file</b> when using deferred client connect method

              • <b>OPENVPN_PLUGIN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY</b> plug-in hooks returns success/failure via <b>auth_control_file</b>
                when using deferred auth method and pending authentication via <b>pending_auth_file</b>.

       <b>--use-prediction-resistance</b>
              Enable prediction resistance on mbed TLS's RNG.

              Enabling prediction resistance causes the RNG to reseed in each call for  random.  Reseeding  this
              often can quickly deplete the kernel entropy pool.

              If you need this option, please consider running a daemon that adds entropy to the kernel pool.

       <b>--user</b> <u>user</u>
              Change the user ID of the OpenVPN process to <b>user</b> after initialization, dropping privileges in the
              process. This option is useful to protect the system in the event that some hostile party was able
              to  gain  control of an OpenVPN session. Though OpenVPN's security features make this unlikely, it
              is provided as a second line of defense.

              By setting <b>user</b> to an unprivileged user dedicated to run  openvpn,  the  hostile  party  would  be
              limited  in  what  damage  they  could  cause. Of course once you take away privileges, you cannot
              return them to an OpenVPN session. This means, for example, that if you want to reset  an  OpenVPN
              daemon with a <b>SIGUSR1</b> signal (for example in response to a DHCP reset), you should make use of one
              or  more  of  the  <b>--persist</b> options to ensure that OpenVPN doesn't need to execute any privileged
              operations in order to restart (such as re-reading key  files  or  running  <b>ifconfig</b>  on  the  TUN
              device).

              NOTE:  Previous  versions  of  openvpn  used  <b>nobody</b>  as the example unpriviledged user. It is not
              recommended to actually use that user since it is usually used by other system  services  already.
              Always create a dedicated user for openvpn.

       <b>--writepid</b> <u>file</u>
              Write OpenVPN's main process ID to <b>file</b>.

   <b>Log</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>--echo</b> <u>parms</u>
              Echo <b>parms</b> to log output.

              Designed  to  be used to send messages to a controlling application which is receiving the OpenVPN
              log output.

       <b>--errors-to-stderr</b>
              Output errors to stderr instead of stdout unless log output is redirected  by  one  of  the  <b>--log</b>
              options.

       <b>--log</b> <u>file</u>
              Output  logging  messages  to <b>file</b>, including output to stdout/stderr which is generated by called
              scripts. If <b>file</b> already exists it will be truncated. This option takes effect immediately when it
              is parsed in the command line and will supersede syslog output if <b>--daemon</b> is also specified. This
              option is persistent over the entire course of an OpenVPN instantiation and will not be  reset  by
              <b>SIGHUP</b>, <b>SIGUSR1</b>, or <b>--ping-restart</b>.

              Note  that on Windows, when OpenVPN is started as a service, logging occurs by default without the
              need to specify this option.

       <b>--log-append</b> <u>file</u>
              Append logging messages to <b>file</b>.  If <b>file</b> does not exist, it will be created. This option  behaves
              exactly like <b>--log</b> except that it appends to rather than truncating the log file.

       <b>--machine-readable-output</b>
              Always  write  timestamps and message flags to log messages, even when they otherwise would not be
              prefixed. In particular, this applies to log messages sent to stdout.

       <b>--mute</b> <u>n</u>
              Log at most <b>n</b> consecutive messages in the same  category.  This  is  useful  to  limit  repetitive
              logging of similar message types.

       <b>--mute-replay-warnings</b>
              Silence  the  output  of  replay  warnings,  which are a common false alarm on WiFi networks. This
              option preserves the security of the replay protection code without the verbosity associated  with
              warnings about duplicate packets.

       <b>--suppress-timestamps</b>
              Avoid  writing  timestamps  to  log  messages,  even  when  they  otherwise would be prepended. In
              particular, this applies to log messages sent to stdout.

       <b>--syslog</b> <u>progname</u>
              Direct log output to system logger, but do not become a daemon. See <b>--daemon</b> directive  above  for
              description of <b>progname</b> parameter.

       <b>--verb</b> <u>n</u>
              Set output verbosity to <b>n</b> (default <b>1</b>). Each level shows all info from the previous levels. Level <b>3</b>
              is recommended if you want a good summary of what's happening without being swamped by output.

              <b>0</b>      No output except fatal errors.

              <b>1</b> <b>to</b> <b>4</b> Normal usage range.

              <b>5</b>      Outputs <b>R</b> and <b>W</b> characters to the console for each packet read and write, uppercase is used
                     for TCP/UDP packets and lowercase is used for TUN/TAP packets.

              <b>6</b> <b>to</b> <b>11</b>
                     Debug  info  range  (see  <b>errlevel.h</b> in the source code for additional information on debug
                     levels).

   <b>Protocol</b> <b>options</b>
       Options in this section affect features available in the OpenVPN wire protocol.  Many  of  these  options
       also  define the encryption options of the data channel in the OpenVPN wire protocol.  These options must
       be configured in a compatible way between both the local and remote side.

       <b>--allow-compression</b> <u>mode</u>
              As described in the <b>--compress</b> option, compression is a potentially dangerous option.  This option
              allows controlling the behaviour of OpenVPN when compression is used and allowed.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 allow-compression
                 allow-compression mode

              The <b>mode</b> argument can be one of the following values:

              <b>asym</b>   OpenVPN will only <u>decompress</u> <u>downlink</u> <u>packets</u> but <u>not</u> <u>compress</u> <u>uplink</u> <u>packets</u>.   This  also
                     allows migrating to disable compression when changing both server and client configurations
                     to remove compression at the same time is not a feasible option.

              <b>no</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     OpenVPN  will  refuse any compression.  If data-channel offloading is enabled, OpenVPN will
                     additionally also refuse compression framing (stub).

              <b>yes</b>    OpenVPN will send and receive compressed packets.

       <b>--auth</b> <u>alg</u>
              Authenticate data channel packets and (if enabled) <b>tls-auth</b>  control  channel  packets  with  HMAC
              using  message  digest  algorithm  <b>alg</b>.  (The  default  is <b>SHA1</b> ). HMAC is a commonly used message
              authentication algorithm (MAC) that uses a data string, a secure  hash  algorithm  and  a  key  to
              produce a digital signature.

              The OpenVPN data channel protocol uses encrypt-then-mac (i.e. first encrypt a packet then HMAC the
              resulting ciphertext), which prevents padding oracle attacks.

              If an AEAD cipher mode (e.g. GCM) is chosen then the specified <b>--auth</b> algorithm is ignored for the
              data channel and the authentication method of the AEAD cipher is used instead. Note that <b>alg</b> still
              specifies the digest used for <b>tls-auth</b>.

              In  static-key encryption mode, the HMAC key is included in the key file generated by <b>--genkey</b>. In
              TLS mode, the HMAC key is dynamically generated and shared  between  peers  via  the  TLS  control
              channel.  If  OpenVPN receives a packet with a bad HMAC it will drop the packet. HMAC usually adds
              16 or 20 bytes per packet. Set <b>alg=none</b> to disable authentication.

              For more information on HMAC see <u><a href="http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/users/mihir/papers/hmac.html">http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/users/mihir/papers/hmac.html</a></u>

       <b>--cipher</b> <u>alg</u>
              This option should not be used any longer in TLS mode and still exists for two reasons:

              • compatibility with old configurations still carrying it around;

              • allow users connecting to OpenVPN peers older than 2.6.0 to have <b>--cipher</b>  configured  the  same
                way as the remote counterpart. This can avoid MTU/frame size warnings.

              Before  2.4.0,  this  option  was  used to select the cipher to be configured on the data channel,
              however, later versions usually ignored this directive in favour of a negotiated cipher.  Starting
              with 2.6.0, this option is always ignored in TLS mode when it comes to configuring the cipher  and
              will  only  control the cipher for <b>--secret</b> pre-shared-key mode (note: this mode is deprecated and
              strictly not recommended).

              If you wish to specify the cipher to use on the  data  channel,  please  see  <b>--data-ciphers</b>  (for
              regular  negotiation)  and  <b>--data-ciphers-fallback</b>  (for  a  fallback option when the negotiation
              cannot take place because the other peer is old or has negotiation disabled).

              To see ciphers that are available with OpenVPN, use the <b>--show-ciphers</b> option.

              Set <b>alg</b> to <b>none</b> to disable encryption.

       <b>--compress</b> <u>algorithm</u>
              <b>DEPRECATED</b> Enable a compression algorithm. Compression is generally not recommended.  VPN  tunnels
              which use compression are susceptible to the VORALCE attack vector. See also the <b>migrate</b> parameter
              below.

              The <b>algorithm</b> parameter may be <b>lzo</b>, <b>lz4</b>, <b>lz4-v2</b>, <b>stub</b>, <b>stub-v2</b>, <b>migrate</b> or empty.  LZO and LZ4 are
              different  compression algorithms, with LZ4 generally offering the best performance with least CPU
              usage.

              The <b>lz4-v2</b> and <b>stub-v2</b> variants implement a better framing that does not add overhead when packets
              cannot be compressed. All other variants  always  add  one  extra  framing  byte  compared  to  no
              compression framing.

              Especially  <b>stub-v2</b>  is  essentially identical to no compression and no compression framing as its
              header indicates IP version 5 in a tun setup and can (ab)used to complete disable  compression  to
              clients. (See the <b>migrate</b> option below)

              If  the  <b>algorithm</b>  parameter  is  <b>stub</b>, <b>stub-v2</b> or empty, compression will be turned off, but the
              packet framing for compression will still be enabled, allowing a different setting  to  be  pushed
              later.   Additionally, <b>stub</b> and <b>stub-v2</b> wil disable announcing <b>lzo</b> and <b>lz4</b> compression support via
              <u>IV</u><b>_</b> variables to the server.

              Note: the <b>stub</b> (or empty) option is NOT compatible with the older option <b>--comp-lzo</b> <b>no</b>.

              Using <b>migrate</b> as compression algorithm enables a special migration mode.  It allows migration away
              from the <b>--compress</b>/<b>--comp-lzo</b> options to no compression.  This  option  sets  the  server  to  no
              compression mode and the server behaves identical to a server without a compression option for all
              clients  without  a  compression  in their config. However, if a client is detected that indicates
              that compression is used (via OCC), the server will automatically add <b>--push</b> <b>compress</b>  <b>stub-v2</b>  to
              the  client  specific configuration if supported by the client and otherwise switch to <b>comp-lzo</b> <b>no</b>
              and add <b>--push</b> <b>comp-lzo</b> to the client specific configuration.

              <b>*Security</b> <b>Considerations*</b>

              Compression and encryption is a tricky combination. If an attacker knows or  is  able  to  control
              (parts  of)  the plain-text of packets that contain secrets, the attacker might be able to extract
              the secret if compression is enabled. See e.g. the <u>CRIME</u> and <u>BREACH</u> attacks on TLS and <u>VORACLE</u>  on
              VPNs which also leverage to break encryption. If you are not entirely sure that the above does not
              apply to your traffic, you are advised to <u>not</u> enable compression.

       <b>--comp-lzo</b> <u>mode</u>
              <b>DEPRECATED</b>  Enable  LZO  compression  algorithm.   Compression  is generally not recommended.  VPN
              tunnels which uses compression are suspectible to the VORALCE attack vector.

              Use LZO compression -- may add up to 1 byte per packet for incompressible data. <b>mode</b> may  be  <b>yes</b>,
              <b>no</b>, or <b>adaptive</b> (default).

              In  a  server  mode setup, it is possible to selectively turn compression on or off for individual
              clients.

              First, make sure the client-side config file enables selective compression by having at least  one
              <b>--comp-lzo</b>  directive, such as <b>--comp-lzo</b> <b>no</b>. This will turn off compression by default, but allow
              a future directive push from the server to dynamically change the <b>on</b>/<b>off</b>/<b>adaptive</b> setting.

              Next in a <b>--client-config-dir</b> file, specify the compression setting for the client, for example:

                 comp-lzo yes
                 push "comp-lzo yes"

              The first line sets the <b>comp-lzo</b> setting for the server side of the  link,  the  second  sets  the
              client side.

       <b>--comp-noadapt</b>
              <b>DEPRECATED</b>  When  used in conjunction with <b>--comp-lzo</b>, this option will disable OpenVPN's adaptive
              compression algorithm. Normally, adaptive compression is enabled with <b>--comp-lzo</b>.

              Adaptive compression tries to optimize the case where you have compression enabled,  but  you  are
              sending  predominantly  incompressible (or pre-compressed) packets over the tunnel, such as an FTP
              or  rsync  transfer  of  a  large,  compressed  file.  With  adaptive  compression,  OpenVPN  will
              periodically sample the compression process to measure its efficiency. If the data being sent over
              the  tunnel is already compressed, the compression efficiency will be very low, triggering openvpn
              to disable compression for a period of time until the next re-sample test.

       <b>--key-direction</b>
              Alternative way of specifying the optional direction parameter for  the  <b>--tls-auth</b>  and  <b>--secret</b>
              options. Useful when using inline files (See section on inline files).

       <b>--data-ciphers</b> <u>cipher-list</u>
              Restrict  the  allowed  ciphers  to  be negotiated to the ciphers in <b>cipher-list</b>. <b>cipher-list</b> is a
              colon-separated list of ciphers, and defaults  to  <b>AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM:CHACHA20-POLY1305</b>  when
              Chacha20-Poly1305 is available and otherwise <b>AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM</b>.

              For servers, the first cipher from <b>cipher-list</b> that is also supported by the client will be pushed
              to clients that support cipher negotiation.

              For  more  details  see the chapter on <u>Data</u> <u>channel</u> <u>cipher</u> <u>negotiation</u>.  <u>Especially</u> if you need to
              support clients with OpenVPN versions older than 2.4!

              Starting with OpenVPN 2.6 a cipher can be prefixed with a <b>?</b> to mark it as  optional.  This  allows
              including   ciphers   in   the   list   that   may  not  be  available  on  all  platforms.   E.g.
              <b>AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM:?CHACHA20-POLY1305</b> would only enable Chacha20-Poly1305 if  the  underlying
              SSL library (and its configuration) supports it.

              Cipher  negotiation  is  enabled  in  client-server  mode  only.  I.e.  if <b>--mode</b> is set to <u>server</u>
              (server-side, implied by setting <b>--server</b> ), or if <b>--pull</b> is specified  (client-side,  implied  by
              setting <b>--client</b>).

              If  no  common cipher is found during cipher negotiation, the connection is terminated. To support
              old  clients/old  servers   that   do   not   provide   any   cipher   negotiation   support   see
              <b>--data-ciphers-fallback</b>.

              If  <b>--compat-mode</b>  is  set  to a version older than 2.5.0 the cipher specified by <b>--cipher</b> will be
              appended to <b>--data-ciphers</b> if not already present.

              This list is restricted to be 127 chars long after conversion to OpenVPN ciphers.

              This option was called <b>--ncp-ciphers</b> in OpenVPN 2.4 but has  been  renamed  to  <b>--data-ciphers</b>  in
              OpenVPN 2.5 to more accurately reflect its meaning.

       <b>--data-ciphers-fallback</b> <u>alg</u>
              Configure a cipher that is used to fall back to if we could not determine which cipher the peer is
              willing to use.

              This  option  should  only  be  needed  to  connect to peers that are running OpenVPN 2.3 or older
              versions, and have been configured  with  <b>--enable-small</b>  (typically  used  on  routers  or  other
              embedded devices).

       <b>--secret</b> <u>args</u>
              <b>DEPRECATED</b>  Enable  Static  Key  encryption  mode  (non-TLS). Use pre-shared secret <b>file</b> which was
              generated with <b>--genkey</b>.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 secret file
                 secret file direction

              The optional <b>direction</b> parameter enables the use of 4 distinct  keys  (HMAC-send,  cipher-encrypt,
              HMAC-receive,  cipher-decrypt),  so  that each data flow direction has a different set of HMAC and
              cipher keys. This has a number of desirable  security  properties  including  eliminating  certain
              kinds of DoS and message replay attacks.

              When  the  <b>direction</b>  parameter  is omitted, 2 keys are used bidirectionally, one for HMAC and the
              other for encryption/decryption.

              The <b>direction</b> parameter should always be complementary on either side of the connection, i.e.  one
              side should use <b>0</b> and the other should use <b>1</b>, or both sides should omit it altogether.

              The  <b>direction</b>  parameter  requires  that  <b>file</b> contains a 2048 bit key. While pre-1.5 versions of
              OpenVPN generate 1024 bit  key  files,  any  version  of  OpenVPN  which  supports  the  <b>direction</b>
              parameter, will also support 2048 bit key file generation using the <b>--genkey</b> option.

              Static key encryption mode has certain advantages, the primary being ease of configuration.

              There  are  no  certificates  or certificate authorities or complicated negotiation handshakes and
              protocols. The only requirement is that you have a pre-existing  secure  channel  with  your  peer
              (such as <b>ssh</b>) to initially copy the key. This requirement, along with the fact that your key never
              changes  unless  you manually generate a new one, makes it somewhat less secure than TLS mode (see
              below). If an attacker manages to steal your key, everything that was ever encrypted  with  it  is
              compromised.  Contrast  that  to  the  perfect  forward secrecy features of TLS mode (using Diffie
              Hellman key exchange), where even if an attacker was able to steal your private key, he would gain
              no information to help him decrypt past sessions.

              Another advantageous aspect of Static Key encryption mode is that it is a handshake-free  protocol
              without  any distinguishing signature or feature (such as a header or protocol handshake sequence)
              that would mark the ciphertext packets as being generated by OpenVPN. Anyone eavesdropping on  the
              wire would see nothing but random-looking data.

       <b>--tran-window</b> <u>n</u>
              Transition window -- our old key can live this many seconds after a new a key renegotiation begins
              (default  <b>3600</b>  seconds).  This  feature allows for a graceful transition from old to new key, and
              removes the key renegotiation sequence from the critical path of tunnel data forwarding.

       <b>--force-tls-key-material-export</b>
              This option is only available in --mode server and forces to use Keying  Material  Exporters  (RFC
              5705)  for  clients.  This  can be used to simulate an environment where the cryptographic library
              does not support the older method to generate data channel keys anymore. This option  is  intended
              to be a test option and might be removed in a future OpenVPN version without notice.

   <b>Client</b> <b>Options</b>
       The  client  options  are  used  when  connecting  to  an  OpenVPN  server  configured  to  use <b>--server</b>,
       <b>--server-bridge</b>, or <b>--mode</b> <b>server</b> in its configuration.

       <b>--allow-pull-fqdn</b>
              Allow client to pull DNS names  from  server  (rather  than  being  limited  to  IP  address)  for
              <b>--ifconfig</b>, <b>--route</b>, and <b>--route-gateway</b>.

       <b>--allow-recursive-routing</b>
              When this option is set, OpenVPN will not drop incoming tun packets with same destination as host.

       <b>--auth-token</b> <u>token</u>
              This  is not an option to be used directly in any configuration files, but rather push this option
              from a <b>--client-connect</b> script or a <b>--plugin</b> which hooks into the <b>OPENVPN_PLUGIN_CLIENT_CONNECT</b> or
              <b>OPENVPN_PLUGIN_CLIENT_CONNECT_V2</b> calls. This option provides a possibility to replace the  clients
              password with an authentication token during the lifetime of the OpenVPN client.

              Whenever  the connection is renegotiated and the <b>--auth-user-pass-verify</b> script or <b>--plugin</b> making
              use of the <b>OPENVPN_PLUGIN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY</b> hook is triggered, it will pass over this token as
              the password instead of the password the user provided. The authentication token can only be reset
              by a full reconnect where the server can push new options to the client.  The  password  the  user
              entered  is  never preserved once an authentication token has been set. If the OpenVPN server side
              rejects the authentication token then the client will receive an <b>AUTH_FAILED</b> and disconnect.

              The purpose of this is to enable two factor authentication methods, such as HOTP or  TOTP,  to  be
              used  without needing to retrieve a new OTP code each time the connection is renegotiated. Another
              use case is to cache authentication data on the client without needing to have the users  password
              cached in memory during the life time of the session.

              To make use of this feature, the <b>--client-connect</b> script or <b>--plugin</b> needs to put

                 push "auth-token UNIQUE_TOKEN_VALUE"

              into  the  file/buffer  for  dynamic configuration data. This will then make the OpenVPN server to
              push this value to the client, which replaces the local password with the <b>UNIQUE_TOKEN_VALUE</b>.

              Newer clients (2.4.7+) will fall back to the original password method after a failed  auth.  Older
              clients will keep using the token value and react according to <b>--auth-retry</b>

       <b>--auth-token-user</b> <u>base64username</u>
              Companion  option  to  <b>--auth-token</b>.  This options allows one to override the username used by the
              client when reauthenticating with the <b>auth-token</b>.  It also  allows  one  to  use  <b>--auth-token</b>  in
              setups that normally do not use username and password.

              The username has to be base64 encoded.

       <b>--auth-user-pass</b>
              Authenticate with server using username/password.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 auth-user-pass
                 auth-user-pass up

              If  <b>up</b> is present, it must be a file containing username/password on 2 lines. If the password line
              is missing, OpenVPN will prompt for one.

              If <b>up</b> is omitted, username/password will be prompted from the console.

              This option can also be inlined

                 &lt;auth-user-pass&gt;
                 username
                 [password]
                 &lt;/auth-user-pass&gt;

              where password is optional, and will be prompted from the console if missing.

              The  server  configuration  must  specify  an  <b>--auth-user-pass-verify</b>  script   to   verify   the
              username/password provided by the client.

       <b>--auth-retry</b> <u>type</u>
              Controls  how  OpenVPN  responds  to username/password verification errors such as the client-side
              response to an <b>AUTH_FAILED</b> message from the server or verification  failure  of  the  private  key
              password.

              Normally  used  to  prevent  auth  errors  from  being  fatal  on  the  client side, and to permit
              username/password requeries in case of error.

              An  <b>AUTH_FAILED</b>  message  is  generated  by  the  server  if  the  client  fails  <b>--auth-user-pass</b>
              authentication,  or  if  the  server-side <b>--client-connect</b> script returns an error status when the
              client tries to connect.

              <b>type</b> can be one of:

              <b>none</b>   Client will exit with a fatal error (this is the default).

              <b>nointeract</b>
                     Client  will  retry   the   connection   without   requerying   for   an   <b>--auth-user-pass</b>
                     username/password. Use this option for unattended clients.

              <b>interact</b>
                     Client  will  requery for an <b>--auth-user-pass</b> username/password and/or private key password
                     before attempting a reconnection.

              Note that while this option cannot be pushed, it can be controlled from the management interface.

       <b>--client</b>
              A helper directive designed to simplify the configuration of OpenVPN's client mode. This directive
              is equivalent to:

                 pull
                 tls-client

       <b>--client-nat</b> <u>args</u>
              This pushable client option sets up a stateless one-to-one  NAT  rule  on  packet  addresses  (not
              ports), and is useful in cases where routes or ifconfig settings pushed to the client would create
              an IP numbering conflict.

              Examples:

                 client-nat snat 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0
                 client-nat dnat 10.64.0.0/255.255.0.0

              <b>network/netmask</b>  (for  example  <b>192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0</b>) defines the local view of a resource from
              the client perspective, while <b>alias/netmask</b> (for example <b>10.64.0.0/255.255.0.0</b>) defines the remote
              view from the server perspective.

              Use <b>snat</b> (source NAT) for resources owned by the client and  <b>dnat</b>  (destination  NAT)  for  remote
              resources.

              Set <b>--verb</b> <b>6</b> for debugging info showing the transformation of src/dest addresses in packets.

       <b>--connect-retry</b> <u>args</u>
              Wait <b>n</b> seconds between connection attempts (default <b>1</b>).  Repeated reconnection attempts are slowed
              down after 5 retries per remote by doubling the wait time after each unsuccessful attempt.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 connect retry n
                 connect retry n max

              If  the  optional  argument <b>max</b> is specified, the maximum wait time in seconds gets capped at that
              value (default <b>300</b>).

       <b>--connect-retry-max</b> <u>n</u>
              <b>n</b> specifies the number of times each <b>--remote</b> or <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> entry is tried. Specifying  <b>n</b>  as  <b>1</b>
              would  try  each  entry  exactly  once.  A  successful  connection  resets  the counter.  (default
              <u>unlimited</u>).

       <b>--connect-timeout</b> <u>n</u>
              See <b>--server-poll-timeout</b>.

       <b>--dns</b> <u>args</u>
              Client DNS configuration to be used with the connection.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 dns search-domains domain [domain ...]
                 dns server n address addr[:port] [addr[:port] ...]
                 dns server n resolve-domains domain [domain ...]
                 dns server n dnssec yes|optional|no
                 dns server n transport DoH|DoT|plain
                 dns server n sni server-name

              The <b>--dns</b> <b>search-domains</b> directive takes one or more domain  names  to  be  added  as  DNS  domain
              suffixes.  If  it is repeated multiple times within a configuration the domains are appended, thus
              e.g. domain names pushed by a server will amend locally defined ones.

              The <b>--dns</b> <b>server</b> directive is used to configure DNS server <b>n</b>.  The server id <b>n</b>  must  be  a  value
              between -128 and 127. For pushed DNS server options it must be between 0 and 127. The server id is
              used to group options and also for ordering the list of configured DNS servers; lower numbers come
              first.  DNS  servers being pushed to a client replace already configured DNS servers with the same
              server id.

              The <b>address</b> option configures the IPv4 and / or IPv6 address(es) of the DNS server.  Up  to  eight
              addresses  can be specified per DNS server.  Optionally a port can be appended after a colon. IPv6
              addresses need to be enclosed in brackets if a port is appended.

              The <b>resolve-domains</b> option takes one or more DNS domains used to define a split-dns or dns-routing
              setup, where only the given domains are resolved by the server. Systems which do not support  fine
              grained DNS domain configuration will ignore this setting.

              The  <b>dnssec</b>  option  is used to configure validation of DNSSEC records.  While the exact semantics
              may differ for resolvers on different systems, <b>yes</b> likely makes validation mandatory, <b>no</b>  disables
              it, and <b>optional</b> uses it opportunistically.

              The  <b>transport</b> option enables DNS-over-HTTPS (<b>DoH</b>) or DNS-over-TLS (<b>DoT</b>) for a DNS server. The <b>sni</b>
              option can be used with them to specify the <b>server-name</b> for TLS server name indication.

              Each server has to have at least one address configured for a configuration to be valid.  All  the
              other options can be omitted.

              Note that not all options may be supported on all platforms. As soon support for different systems
              is implemented, information will be added here how unsupported options are treated.

              The <b>--dns</b> option will eventually obsolete the <b>--dhcp-option</b> directive.  Until then it will replace
              configuration  at  the  places <b>--dhcp-option</b> puts it, so that <b>--dns</b> overrides <b>--dhcp-option</b>. Thus,
              <b>--dns</b> can be used today to migrate from <b>--dhcp-option</b>.

       <b>--explicit-exit-notify</b> <u>n</u>
              In UDP client mode or point-to-point mode, send server/peer an  exit  notification  if  tunnel  is
              restarted or OpenVPN process is exited. In client mode, on exit/restart, this option will tell the
              server to immediately close its client instance object rather than waiting for a timeout.

              If both server and client support sending this message using the control channel, the message will
              be  sent  as control-channel message. Otherwise the message is sent as data-channel message, which
              will be ignored by data-channel offloaded peers.

              The <b>n</b> parameter (default <b>1</b> if not present) controls the maximum number of attempts that the client
              will try to resend the exit notification message if messages are sent in data-channel mode.

              In UDP server mode, send <b>RESTART</b> control channel command to connected  clients.  The  <b>n</b>  parameter
              (default  <b>1</b>  if not present) controls client behavior. With <b>n</b> = <b>1</b> client will attempt to reconnect
              to the same server, with <b>n</b> = <b>2</b> client will advance to the next server.

              OpenVPN will not send any exit notifications unless this option is enabled.

       <b>--inactive</b> <u>args</u>
              Causes OpenVPN to exit after <b>n</b> seconds of inactivity on the TUN/TAP device.  The  time  length  of
              inactivity  is  measured since the last incoming or outgoing tunnel packet. The default value is 0
              seconds, which disables this feature.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 inactive n
                 inactive n bytes

              If the optional <b>bytes</b> parameter is included, exit if less than <b>bytes</b> of  combined  in/out  traffic
              are produced on the tun/tap device in <b>n</b> seconds.

              In  any  case, OpenVPN's internal ping packets (which are just keepalives) and TLS control packets
              are not considered "activity", nor are they counted as traffic, as they  are  used  internally  by
              OpenVPN and are not an indication of actual user activity.

       <b>--proto-force</b> <u>p</u>
              When iterating through connection profiles, only consider profiles using protocol <b>p</b> (<b>tcp</b> | <b>udp</b>).

              Note  that  this  specifically only filters by the transport layer protocol, i.e. UDP or TCP. This
              does not affect whether IPv4 or IPv6 is used as IP protocol.

              For implementation reasons the option accepts the <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> suffixes when  specifying  the  protocol
              (i.e. <b>udp4</b> / <b>udp6</b> / <b>tcp4</b> / <b>tcp6</b>).  However, these behave the same as without the suffix and should
              be avoided to prevent confusion.

       <b>--pull</b> This option must be used on a client which is connecting to a multi-client server. It indicates to
              OpenVPN  that  it  should accept options pushed by the server, provided they are part of the legal
              set of pushable options (note that the <b>--pull</b> option is implied by <b>--client</b> ).

              In particular, <b>--pull</b> allows the server to push routes to the client, so you should not use <b>--pull</b>
              or <b>--client</b> in situations where you don't trust the server  to  have  control  over  the  client's
              routing table.

       <b>--pull-filter</b> <u>args</u>
              Filter options on the client pushed by the server to the client.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 pull-filter accept text
                 pull-filter ignore text
                 pull-filter reject text

              Filter  options  received  from the server if the option starts with <b>text</b>.  The action flag <b>accept</b>
              allows the option, <b>ignore</b> removes it and <b>reject</b> flags an error and triggers a <b>SIGUSR1</b> restart. The
              filters may be specified multiple times, and each filter is applied in the order it is  specified.
              The  filtering of each option stops as soon as a match is found. Unmatched options are accepted by
              default.

              Prefix comparison is used to match <b>text</b> against the received option so that

                 pull-filter ignore "route"

              would  remove  all  pushed  options  starting  with  <b>route</b>  which  would  include,  for   example,
              <b>route-gateway</b>. Enclose <u>text</u> in quotes to embed spaces.

                 pull-filter accept "route 192.168.1."
                 pull-filter ignore "route "

              would remove all routes that do not start with <b>192.168.1</b>.

              <u>Note</u>  that <b>reject</b> may result in a repeated cycle of failure and reconnect, unless multiple remotes
              are specified and connection to the next remote succeeds. To silently ignore an option  pushed  by
              the server, use <b>ignore</b>.

       <b>--push-peer-info</b>
              Push additional information about the client to server. The following data is always pushed to the
              server:

              <b>IV_VER=&lt;version&gt;</b>
                     The client OpenVPN version

              <b>IV_PLAT=[linux|solaris|openbsd|mac|netbsd|freebsd|win]</b>
                     The client OS platform

              <b>IV_PROTO</b>
                     Details  about  protocol  extensions that the peer supports. The variable is a bitfield and
                     the bits are defined as follows:

                     • bit 0: Reserved, should always be zero

                     • bit 1: The peer supports peer-id floating mechanism

                     • bit 2: The client expects a push-reply and the server may send this reply without waiting
                       for a push-request first.

                     • bit 3: The client is capable of doing key derivation using RFC5705 key material exporter.

                     • bit 4: The client is capable  of  accepting  additional  arguments  to  the  <b>AUTH_PENDING</b>
                       message.

                     • bit 5: The client supports doing feature negotiation in P2P mode

                     • bit 6: The client is capable of parsing and receiving the <b>--dns</b> pushed option

                     • bit  7: The client is capable of sending exit notification via control channel using <b>EXIT</b>
                       message. Also, the client is accepting the  protocol-flags  pushed  option  for  the  EKM
                       capability

                     • bit 8: The client is capable of accepting <b>AUTH_FAILED,TEMP</b> messages

                     • bit 9: The client is capable of dynamic tls-crypt

              <b>IV_NCP=2</b>
                     Negotiable  ciphers, client supports <b>--cipher</b> pushed by the server, a value of 2 or greater
                     indicates client supports <u>AES-GCM-128</u> and <u>AES-GCM-256</u>. IV_NCP is  <u>deprecated</u>  in  favor  of
                     <b>IV_CIPHERS</b>.

              <b>IV_CIPHERS=&lt;data-ciphers&gt;</b>
                     The  client  announces  the  list  of  supported ciphers configured with the <b>--data-ciphers</b>
                     option to the server.

              <b>IV_MTU=&lt;max_mtu&gt;</b>
                     The client announces the support of pushable MTU and the  maximum  MTU  it  is  willing  to
                     accept.

              <b>IV_GUI_VER=&lt;gui_id&gt;</b> <b>&lt;version&gt;</b>
                     The  UI  version  of  a  UI if one is running, for example <b>de.blinkt.openvpn</b> <b>0.5.47</b> for the
                     Android app.  This may be set by the client UI/GUI using <b>--setenv</b>.

              <b>IV_SSO=[crtext,][openurl,][proxy_url]</b>
                     Additional authentication methods supported by the client.  This may be set by  the  client
                     UI/GUI using <b>--setenv</b>.

              The following flags depend on which compression formats are compiled in and whether compression is
              allowed by options. See <u>Protocol</u> <u>options</u> for more details.

                 <b>IV_LZO=1</b>
                        If client supports LZO compression.

                 <b>IV_LZO_STUB=1</b>
                        If client was built with LZO stub capability. This is only sent if <b>IV_LZO=1</b> is not sent.
                        This means the client can talk to a server configured with <b>--comp-lzo</b> <b>no</b>.

                 <b>IV_LZ4=1</b> <b>and</b> <b>IV_LZ4v2=1</b>
                        If the client supports LZ4 compression.

                 <b>IV_COMP_STUB=1</b> <b>and</b> <b>IV_COMP_STUBv2=1</b>
                        If  the  client  supports  stub  compression. This means the client can talk to a server
                        configured with <b>--compress</b>.

              When <b>--push-peer-info</b> is enabled the additional information consists of the following data:

              <b>IV_HWADDR=&lt;string&gt;</b>
                     This is intended to be a unique and persistent ID of the client.  The string value  can  be
                     any  readable  ASCII string up to 64 bytes.  OpenVPN 2.x and some other implementations use
                     the MAC address of the client's interface used to reach the default gateway. If this string
                     is generated by the client, it  should  be  consistent  and  preserved  across  independent
                     sessions and preferably re-installations and upgrades.

              <b>IV_SSL=&lt;version</b> <b>string&gt;</b>
                     The ssl library version used by the client, e.g.  <b>OpenSSL</b> <b>1.0.2f</b> <b>28</b> <b>Jan</b> <b>2016</b>.

              <b>IV_PLAT_VER=x.y</b>
                     The version of the operating system, e.g. 6.1 for Windows 7.  This may be set by the client
                     UI/GUI  using  <b>--setenv</b>.   On  Windows  systems  it  is automatically determined by openvpn
                     itself.

              <b>UV_&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b>
                     Client environment variables whose names start with <b>UV_</b>

       <b>--remote</b> <u>args</u>
              Remote host name or IP address, port and protocol.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 remote host
                 remote host port
                 remote host port proto

              The <b>port</b> and <b>proto</b> arguments are optional. The OpenVPN client will try to connect to a  server  at
              <b>host:port</b>.   The <b>proto</b> argument indicates the protocol to use when connecting with the remote, and
              may be <b>tcp</b> or <b>udp</b>.  To enforce IPv4 or IPv6 connections add a <b>4</b> or <b>6</b> suffix; like <b>udp4</b>  /  <b>udp6</b>  /
              <b>tcp4</b> / <b>tcp6</b>.

              On  the  client,  multiple  <b>--remote</b>  options may be specified for redundancy, each referring to a
              different OpenVPN server, in the order specified by  the  list  of  <b>--remote</b>  options.  Specifying
              multiple   <b>--remote</b>   options   for   this   purpose  is  a  special  case  of  the  more  general
              connection-profile feature. See the <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> documentation below.

              The client will move on to the next host in the list, in the event  of  connection  failure.  Note
              that at any given time, the OpenVPN client will at most be connected to one server.

              Examples:

                 remote server1.example.net
                 remote server1.example.net 1194
                 remote server2.example.net 1194 tcp

              <u>Note:</u>  Since UDP is connectionless, connection failure is defined by the <b>--ping</b> and <b>--ping-restart</b>
                     options.

                     Also,  if  you  use  multiple <b>--remote</b> options, AND you are dropping root privileges on the
                     client with <b>--user</b> and/or <b>--group</b> AND the client is running a non-Windows OS, if the client
                     needs to switch to a different server, and that server pushes  back  different  TUN/TAP  or
                     route  settings,  the  client  may  lack  the  necessary privileges to close and reopen the
                     TUN/TAP interface. This could cause the client to exit with a fatal error.

              If <b>--remote</b> is unspecified, OpenVPN will listen for packets from any IP address, but will not  act
              on those packets unless they pass all authentication tests. This requirement for authentication is
              binding  on  all potential peers, even those from known and supposedly trusted IP addresses (it is
              very easy to forge a source IP address on a UDP packet).

              When used in TCP mode, <b>--remote</b> will act as a filter, rejecting connections from  any  host  which
              does not match <b>host</b>.

              If  <b>host</b> is a DNS name which resolves to multiple IP addresses, OpenVPN will try them in the order
              that the system getaddrinfo() presents them, so priorization and DNS randomization is done by  the
              system library. Unless an IP version is forced by the protocol specification (4/6 suffix), OpenVPN
              will try both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, in the order getaddrinfo() returns them.

       <b>--remote-random</b>
              When  multiple  <b>--remote</b>  address/ports  are  specified, or if connection profiles are being used,
              initially randomize the order of the list as a kind of basic load-balancing measure.

       <b>--remote-random-hostname</b>
              Prepend a random string (6 bytes, 12 hex characters) to  hostname  to  prevent  DNS  caching.  For
              example, "foo.bar.gov" would be modified to "&lt;random-chars&gt;.foo.bar.gov".

       <b>--resolv-retry</b> <u>n</u>
              If hostname resolve fails for <b>--remote</b>, retry resolve for <b>n</b> seconds before failing.

              Set <b>n</b> to <b>infinite</b> to retry indefinitely.

              By default, <b>--resolv-retry</b> <b>infinite</b> is enabled. You can disable by setting n=0.

       <b>--single-session</b>
              After initially connecting to a remote peer, disallow any new connections. Using this option means
              that a remote peer cannot connect, disconnect, and then reconnect.

              If the daemon is reset by a signal or <b>--ping-restart</b>, it will allow one new connection.

              <b>--single-session</b>  can  be  used  with <b>--ping-exit</b> or <b>--inactive</b> to create a single dynamic session
              that will exit when finished.

       <b>--server-poll-timeout</b> <u>n</u>
              When connecting to a remote server do not wait for more than  <b>n</b>  seconds  for  a  response  before
              trying  the  next  server.  The  default value is <b>120</b>. This timeout includes proxy and TCP connect
              timeouts.

       <b>--static-challenge</b> <u>args</u>
              Enable static challenge/response protocol

              Valid syntax:

                 static-challenge text echo

              The <b>text</b> challenge text is presented to the user which describes what  information  is  requested.
              The <b>echo</b> flag indicates if the user's input should be echoed on the screen.  Valid <b>echo</b> values are
              <b>0</b> or <b>1</b>.

              See   management-notes.txt   in  the  OpenVPN  distribution  for  a  description  of  the  OpenVPN
              challenge/response protocol.

       <b>--http-proxy</b> <u>args</u>
              Connect to remote host through an HTTP proxy.  This requires at least an address <b>server</b>  and  <b>port</b>
              argument.   If  HTTP  Proxy-Authenticate is required, a file name to an <b>authfile</b> file containing a
              username and password on 2 lines can be given, or <b>stdin</b> to prompt from console.  Its  content  can
              also  be  specified  in  the  config  file with the <b>--http-proxy-user-pass</b> option (See <u>INLINE</u> <u>FILE</u>
              <u>SUPPORT</u>).

              The last optional argument is an <b>auth-method</b> which should be one of <b>none</b>, <b>basic</b>, or <b>ntlm</b>.

              HTTP Digest authentication is supported as well, but only via the <b>auto</b> or <b>auto-nct</b> flags  (below).
              This must replace the <b>authfile</b> argument.

              The  <b>auto</b>  flag  causes  OpenVPN to automatically determine the <b>auth-method</b> and query stdin or the
              management interface for username/password credentials, if required. This flag exists  on  OpenVPN
              2.1 or higher.

              The  <b>auto-nct</b>  flag  (no  clear-text  auth)  instructs  OpenVPN  to  automatically  determine  the
              authentication  method,  but  to  reject  weak  authentication  protocols  such  as   HTTP   Basic
              Authentication.

              Examples:

                 # no authentication
                 http-proxy proxy.example.net 3128
                 # basic authentication, load credentials from file
                 http-proxy proxy.example.net 3128 authfile.txt
                 # basic authentication, ask user for credentials
                 http-proxy proxy.example.net 3128 stdin
                 # NTLM authentication, load credentials from file
                 http-proxy proxy.example.net 3128 authfile.txt ntlm2
                 # determine which authentication is required, ask user for credentials
                 http-proxy proxy.example.net 3128 auto
                 # determine which authentication is required, but reject basic
                 http-proxy proxy.example.net 3128 auto-nct
                 # determine which authentication is required, but set credentials
                 http-proxy proxy.example.net 3128 auto
                 http-proxy-user-pass authfile.txt
                 # basic authentication, specify credentials inline
                 http-proxy proxy.example.net 3128 "" basic
                 &lt;http-proxy-user-pass&gt;
                 username
                 password
                 &lt;/http-proxy-user-pass&gt;

       <b>--http-proxy-user-pass</b> <u>userpass</u>
              Overwrite  the  username/password  information  for <b>--http-proxy</b>. If specified as an inline option
              (see <u>INLINE</u> <u>FILE</u> <u>SUPPORT</u>), it will be interpreted as username/password  separated  by  a  newline.
              When  specified  on the command line it is interpreted as a filename same as the third argument to
              <b>--http-proxy</b>.

              Example:

                 &lt;http-proxy-user-pass&gt;
                 username
                 password
                 &lt;/http-proxy-user-pass&gt;

       <b>--http-proxy-option</b> <u>args</u>
              Set extended HTTP proxy options. Requires an option <b>type</b> as argument and an optional <b>parameter</b>  to
              the type.  Repeat to set multiple options.

              <b>VERSION</b> <b>version</b>
                     Set HTTP version number to <b>version</b> (default <b>1.0</b>).

              <b>AGENT</b> <b>user-agent</b>
                     Set HTTP "User-Agent" string to <b>user-agent</b>.

              <b>CUSTOM-HEADER</b> <b>name</b> <b>content</b>
                     Adds  the  custom  Header  with  <b>name</b> as name and <b>content</b> as the content of the custom HTTP
                     header.

              Examples:

                 http-proxy-option VERSION 1.1
                 http-proxy-option AGENT OpenVPN/2.4
                 http-proxy-option X-Proxy-Flag some-flags

       <b>--socks-proxy</b> <u>args</u>
              Connect to remote host through a Socks5 proxy.  A required <b>server</b> argument is needed.   Optionally
              a <b>port</b> (default <b>1080</b>) and <b>authfile</b> can be given.  The <b>authfile</b> is a file containing a username and
              password on 2 lines, or <b>stdin</b> can be used to prompt from console.

   <b>Server</b> <b>Options</b>
       Starting  with  OpenVPN 2.0, a multi-client TCP/UDP server mode is supported, and can be enabled with the
       <b>--mode</b> <b>server</b> option. In server  mode,  OpenVPN  will  listen  on  a  single  port  for  incoming  client
       connections.  All  client  connections will be routed through a single tun or tap interface. This mode is
       designed for scalability and should be  able  to  support  hundreds  or  even  thousands  of  clients  on
       sufficiently fast hardware. SSL/TLS authentication must be used in this mode.

       <b>--auth-gen-token</b> <u>args</u>
              Returns an authentication token to successfully authenticated clients.

              Valid syntax:

                 auth-gen-token [lifetime] [renewal-time] [external-auth]

              After successful user/password authentication, the OpenVPN server will with this option generate a
              temporary  authentication  token and push that to the client. On the following renegotiations, the
              OpenVPN client will pass this token instead of the users password. On the server side  the  server
              will  do  the  token  authentication  internally and it will NOT do any additional authentications
              against configured external user/password authentication mechanisms.

              The tokens implemented by this mechanism include an initial timestamp and a  renew  timestamp  and
              are secured by HMAC.

              The  <b>lifetime</b>  argument defines how long the generated token is valid.  The lifetime is defined in
              seconds. If lifetime is not set or it is set to <b>0</b>, the token will never expire.

              If <b>renewal-time</b> is not set it defaults to <b>reneg-sec</b>.

              The token will expire either after the configured <b>lifetime</b> of the token is reached  or  after  not
              being renewed for more than 2 * <b>renewal-time</b> seconds. Clients will be sent renewed tokens on every
              TLS  renegotiation.  If  <b>renewal-time</b>  is  lower  than  <b>reneg-sec</b> the server will push an  updated
              temporary authentication token every <b>reneweal-time</b> seconds. This is done to invalidate a token  if
              a  client  is  disconnected  for  a sufficiently long time, while at the same time permitting much
              longer token lifetimes for active clients.

              This feature is useful for environments which are configured to use One Time  Passwords  (OTP)  as
              part of the user/password authentications and that authentication mechanism does not implement any
              auth-token support.

              When  the  <b>external-auth</b> keyword is present the normal authentication method will always be called
              even if auth-token succeeds.  Normally other authentications  method  are  skipped  if  auth-token
              verification succeeds or fails.

              This option postpones this decision to the external authentication methods and checks the validity
              of the account and do other checks.

              In  this  mode  the  environment  will  have  a <b>session_id</b> variable that holds the session id from
              auth-gen-token. Also an environment variable <b>session_state</b> is  present.  This  variable  indicates
              whether the auth-token has succeeded or not. It can have the following values:

              <b>Initial</b>
                     No token from client.

              <b>Authenticated</b>
                     Token is valid and not expired.

              <b>Expired</b>
                     Token is valid but has expired.

              <b>Invalid</b>
                     Token is invalid (failed HMAC or wrong length)

              <b>AuthenticatedEmptyUser</b> <b>/</b> <b>ExpiredEmptyUser</b>
                     The  token  is  not  valid  with  the  username sent from the client but would be valid (or
                     expired) if we assume an empty username was used instead.  These two cases are a workaround
                     for behaviour in OpenVPN 3.  If this workaround is not needed these  two  cases  should  be
                     handled in the same way as <b>Invalid</b>.

              <b>Warning:</b>  Use  this  feature  only  if  you  want  your  authentication  method  called  on  every
              verification. Since the external authentication is called it needs to also indicate a  success  or
              failure  of  the authentication. It is strongly recommended to return an authentication failure in
              the case of the Invalid/Expired auth-token with the external-auth option unless the  client  could
              authenticate in another acceptable way (e.g. client certificate), otherwise returning success will
              lead to authentication bypass (as does returning success on a wrong password from a script).

       <b>--auth-gen-token-secret</b> <u>file</u>
              Specifies  a file that holds a secret for the HMAC used in <b>--auth-gen-token</b> If <b>file</b> is not present
              OpenVPN will generate a random secret on startup. This file should be used  if  auth-token  should
              validate  after  restarting  a server or if client should be able to roam between multiple OpenVPN
              servers with their auth-token.

       <b>--auth-user-pass-optional</b>
              Allow  connections  by  clients  that  do  not  specify  a  username/password.    Normally,   when
              <b>--auth-user-pass-verify</b>  or  <b>--management-client-auth</b>  are  specified (or an authentication plugin
              module), the OpenVPN server daemon will require connecting  clients  to  specify  a  username  and
              password. This option makes the submission of a username/password by clients optional, passing the
              responsibility to the user-defined authentication module/script to accept or deny the client based
              on  other factors (such as the setting of X509 certificate fields).  When this option is used, and
              a  connecting  client  does  not  submit  a  username/password,  the  user-defined  authentication
              module/script  will  see  the  username  and  password  as  being  set  to empty strings (""). The
              authentication module/script MUST have logic to detect this condition and respond accordingly.

       <b>--ccd-exclusive</b>
              Require, as a condition of authentication, that a  connecting  client  has  a  <b>--client-config-dir</b>
              file.

       <b>--client-config-dir</b> <u>dir</u>
              Specify  a  directory  <b>dir</b>  for  custom  client  config  files. After a connecting client has been
              authenticated, OpenVPN will look in this directory for a file having the same name as the client's
              X509 common name. If a matching file exists, it will be  opened  and  parsed  for  client-specific
              configuration  options. If no matching file is found, OpenVPN will instead try to open and parse a
              default file called "DEFAULT",  which  may  be  provided  but  is  not  required.  Note  that  the
              configuration  files  must  be  readable  by  the  OpenVPN  process after it has dropped it's root
              privileges.

              This file can specify a fixed IP address for a given client  using  <b>--ifconfig-push</b>,  as  well  as
              fixed subnets owned by the client using <b>--iroute</b>.

              One  of  the  useful  properties of this option is that it allows client configuration files to be
              conveniently created, edited, or removed while the server is live, without needing to restart  the
              server.

              The following options are legal in a client-specific context: <b>--push</b>, <b>--push-reset</b>, <b>--push-remove</b>,
              <b>--iroute</b>, <b>--ifconfig-push</b>, <b>--vlan-pvid</b> and <b>--config</b>.

       <b>--client-to-client</b>
              Because the OpenVPN server mode handles multiple clients through a single tun or tap interface, it
              is   effectively  a  router.  The  <b>--client-to-client</b>  flag  tells  OpenVPN  to  internally  route
              client-to-client traffic rather  than  pushing  all  client-originating  traffic  to  the  TUN/TAP
              interface.

              When  this option is used, each client will "see" the other clients which are currently connected.
              Otherwise, each client will only see the server. Don't use this option if  you  want  to  firewall
              tunnel traffic using custom, per-client rules.

              Please  note  that  when  using data channel offload this option has no effect. Packets are always
              sent to the tunnel interface and then routed based on the system routing table.

       <b>--disable</b>
              Disable a particular client (based on the common name) from connecting.  Don't use this option  to
              disable  a  client  due  to  key  or  password compromise. Use a CRL (certificate revocation list)
              instead (see the <b>--crl-verify</b> option).

              This option must be associated with a specific client  instance,  which  means  that  it  must  be
              specified  either  in  a  client  instance  config  file  using <b>--client-config-dir</b> or dynamically
              generated using a <b>--client-connect</b> script.

       <b>--connect-freq</b> <u>args</u>
              Allow a maximum of <b>n</b> new connections per <b>sec</b> seconds from clients.

              Valid syntax:

                 connect-freq n sec

              This is designed to contain DoS attacks which flood the  server  with  connection  requests  using
              certificates which will ultimately fail to authenticate.

              This limit applies after <b>--connect-freq-initial</b> and only applies to client that have completed the
              three-way  handshake  or  client  that  use <b>--tls-crypt-v2</b> without cookie support (<b>allow-noncookie</b>
              argument to <b>--tls-crypt-v2</b>).

              This is an imperfect solution however, because in a  real  DoS  scenario,  legitimate  connections
              might also be refused.

              For  the best protection against DoS attacks in server mode, use <b>--proto</b> <b>udp</b> and either <b>--tls-auth</b>
              or <b>--tls-crypt</b>.

       <b>--connect-freq-initial</b> <u>args</u>
              (UDP only) Allow a maximum of <b>n</b> initial connection packet  responses  per  <b>sec</b>  seconds  from  the
              OpenVPN server to clients.

              Valid syntax:

                 connect-freq-initial n sec

              OpenVPN  starting  at  2.6 is very efficient in responding to initial connection packets. When not
              limiting the initial responses an OpenVPN daemon can be abused in reflection attacks.  This option
              is designed to limit the rate OpenVPN will respond to initial attacks.

              Connection attempts that complete the initial three-way handshake will not be counted against  the
              limit. The default is to allow 100 initial connection per 10s.

       <b>--duplicate-cn</b>
              Allow  multiple  clients with the same common name to concurrently connect. In the absence of this
              option, OpenVPN will disconnect a client instance upon connection of a new client having the  same
              common name.

       <b>--ifconfig-pool</b> <u>args</u>
              Set  aside  a pool of subnets to be dynamically allocated to connecting clients, similar to a DHCP
              server.

              Valid syntax:

                 ifconfig-pool start-IP end-IP [netmask]

              For tun-style tunnels, each client will be given a /30 subnet (for interoperability  with  Windows
              clients).  For tap-style tunnels, individual addresses will be allocated, and the optional <b>netmask</b>
              parameter will also be pushed to clients.

       <b>--ifconfig-ipv6-pool</b> <u>args</u>
              Specify an IPv6 address pool for dynamic assignment to clients.

              Valid args:

                 ifconfig-ipv6-pool ipv6addr/bits

              The pool starts at <b>ipv6addr</b> and matches the offset determined from the start of the IPv4 pool.  If
              the host part of the given IPv6 address is <b>0</b>, the pool starts at <b>ipv6addr</b> +1.

       <b>--ifconfig-pool-persist</b> <u>args</u>
              Persist/unpersist  ifconfig-pool  data  to <b>file</b>, at <b>seconds</b> intervals (default <b>600</b>), as well as on
              program startup and shutdown.

              Valid syntax:

                 ifconfig-pool-persist file [seconds]

              The goal of this option is to provide a long-term association between clients  (denoted  by  their
              common  name)  and  the  virtual IP address assigned to them from the ifconfig-pool. Maintaining a
              long-term association is  good  for  clients  because  it  allows  them  to  effectively  use  the
              <b>--persist-tun</b> option.

              <b>file</b> is a comma-delimited ASCII file, formatted as <b>&lt;Common-Name&gt;,&lt;IP-address&gt;</b>.

              If  <b>seconds</b> = <b>0</b>, <b>file</b> will be treated as read-only. This is useful if you would like to treat <b>file</b>
              as a configuration file.

              Note that the entries in this file are treated by OpenVPN  as  <u>suggestions</u>  only,  based  on  past
              associations  between  a  common name and IP address.  They do not guarantee that the given common
              name  will  always  receive  the  given  IP  address.  If  you  want  guaranteed  assignment,  use
              <b>--ifconfig-push</b>

       <b>--ifconfig-push</b> <u>args</u>
              Push virtual IP endpoints for client tunnel, overriding the <b>--ifconfig-pool</b> dynamic allocation.

              Valid syntax:

                 ifconfig-push local remote-netmask [alias]

              The  parameters  <b>local</b>  and <b>remote-netmask</b> are set according to the <b>--ifconfig</b> directive which you
              want to execute on the client machine to configure the remote end of the  tunnel.  Note  that  the
              parameters  <b>local</b>  and <b>remote-netmask</b> are from the perspective of the client, not the server. They
              may be DNS names rather than IP addresses, in which case they will be resolved on  the  server  at
              the time of client connection.

              The  optional  <b>alias</b>  parameter may be used in cases where NAT causes the client view of its local
              endpoint to differ from the server view. In this  case  <b>local/remote-netmask</b>  will  refer  to  the
              server view while <b>alias/remote-netmask</b> will refer to the client view.

              This  option  must  be  associated  with  a  specific client instance, which means that it must be
              specified either in a  client  instance  config  file  using  <b>--client-config-dir</b>  or  dynamically
              generated using a <b>--client-connect</b> script.

              Remember also to include a <b>--route</b> directive in the main OpenVPN config file which encloses <b>local</b>,
              so that the kernel will know to route it to the server's TUN/TAP interface.

              OpenVPN's internal client IP address selection algorithm works as follows:

              1. Use <b>--client-connect</b> <b>script</b> generated file for static IP (first choice).

              2. Use <b>--client-config-dir</b> file for static IP (next choice).

              3. Use <b>--ifconfig-pool</b> allocation for dynamic IP (last choice).

       <b>--ifconfig-ipv6-push</b> <u>args</u>
              for  <b>--client-config-dir</b>  per-client  static IPv6 interface configuration, see <b>--client-config-dir</b>
              and <b>--ifconfig-push</b> for more details.

              Valid syntax:

                 ifconfig-ipv6-push ipv6addr/bits ipv6remote

       <b>--multihome</b>
              Configure a multi-homed UDP server. This option needs to be used when a server has more  than  one
              IP  address  (e.g.  multiple  interfaces,  or secondary IP addresses), and is not using <b>--local</b> to
              force binding to one specific address only. This option will add some extra lookups to the  packet
              path  to  ensure  that  the  UDP reply packets are always sent from the address that the client is
              talking to. This is not supported on all platforms, and it  adds  more  processing,  so  it's  not
              enabled by default.

              <u>Notes:</u>

                     • This option is only relevant for UDP servers.

                     • If  you  do  an  IPv6+IPv4 dual-stack bind on a Linux machine with multiple IPv4 address,
                       connections to IPv4 addresses will not work right on kernels before 3.15, due to  missing
                       kernel  support  for the IPv4-mapped case (some distributions have ported this to earlier
                       kernel versions, though).

       <b>--iroute</b> <u>args</u>
              Generate an internal route to a specific client. The <b>netmask</b> parameter, if  omitted,  defaults  to
              <b>255.255.255.255</b>.

              Valid syntax:

                 iroute network [netmask]

              This  directive  can  be  used  to  route  a  fixed subnet from the server to a particular client,
              regardless of where the client is connecting from.  Remember that you must also add the  route  to
              the  system  routing  table  as  well (such as by using the <b>--route</b> directive). The reason why two
              routes are needed is that the <b>--route</b> directive routes the packet from the kernel to OpenVPN. Once
              in OpenVPN, the <b>--iroute</b> directive routes to the specific client.

              However, when using DCO, the <b>--iroute</b> directive is usually enough for DCO to fully  configure  the
              routing  table. The extra <b>--route</b> directive is required only if the expected behaviour is to route
              the traffic for a specific network to the VPN interface also when the responsible  client  is  not
              connected (traffic will then be dropped).

              This option must be specified either in a client instance config file using <b>--client-config-dir</b> or
              dynamically generated using a <b>--client-connect</b> script.

              The  <b>--iroute</b>  directive  also  has  an  important  interaction  with <b>--push</b> <b>"route</b> <b>..."</b>. <b>--iroute</b>
              essentially defines a subnet which is owned by a particular client (we will call this  client  <u>A</u>).
              If  you  would  like  other clients to be able to reach <u>A</u>'s subnet, you can use <b>--push</b> <b>"route</b> <b>..."</b>
              together with <b>--client-to-client</b> to effect this. In order for  all  clients  to  see  <u>A</u>'s  subnet,
              OpenVPN  must push this route to all clients EXCEPT for <u>A</u>, since the subnet is already owned by <u>A</u>.
              OpenVPN accomplishes this by not not pushing a route to a client if it matches one of the client's
              iroutes.

       <b>--iroute-ipv6</b> <u>args</u>
              for <b>--client-config-dir</b> per-client static IPv6 route configuration, see <b>--iroute</b> for more  details
              how to setup and use this, and how <b>--iroute</b> and <b>--route</b> interact.

              Valid syntax:

                 iroute-ipv6 ipv6addr/bits

       <b>--max-clients</b> <u>n</u>
              Limit server to a maximum of <b>n</b> concurrent clients.

       <b>--max-routes-per-client</b> <u>n</u>
              Allow  a  maximum  of <b>n</b> internal routes per client (default <b>256</b>). This is designed to help contain
              DoS attacks where an authenticated client floods the server with packets appearing  to  come  from
              many  unique  MAC  addresses, forcing the server to deplete virtual memory as its internal routing
              table expands. This directive can be used in a <b>--client-config-dir</b> file  or  auto-generated  by  a
              <b>--client-connect</b> script to override the global value for a particular client.

              Note that this directive affects OpenVPN's internal routing table, not the kernel routing table.

       <b>--opt-verify</b>
              <b>DEPRECATED</b>  Clients  that connect with options that are incompatible with those of the server will
              be disconnected.

              Options that will be compared  for  compatibility  include  <b>dev-type</b>,  <b>link-mtu</b>,  <b>tun-mtu</b>,  <b>proto</b>,
              <b>ifconfig</b>,  <b>comp-lzo</b>,  <b>fragment</b>,  <b>keydir</b>,  <b>cipher</b>,  <b>auth</b>,  <b>keysize</b>,  <b>secret</b>,  <b>no-replay</b>,  <b>tls-auth</b>,
              <b>key-method</b>, <b>tls-server</b> and <b>tls-client</b>.

              This option requires that <b>--disable-occ</b> NOT be used.

       <b>--port-share</b> <u>args</u>
              Share OpenVPN TCP with another service

              Valid syntax:

                 port-share host port [dir]

              When run in TCP server mode, share the OpenVPN port with another application,  such  as  an  HTTPS
              server.  If OpenVPN senses a connection to its port which is using a non-OpenVPN protocol, it will
              proxy the connection to the server at <b>host</b>:<b>port</b>. Currently only designed to work with  HTTP/HTTPS,
              though it would be theoretically possible to extend to other protocols such as ssh.

              <b>dir</b>  specifies  an optional directory where a temporary file with name N containing content C will
              be dynamically generated for each proxy connection, where N is the source IP:port  of  the  client
              connection and C is the source IP:port of the connection to the proxy receiver. This directory can
              be  used  as  a  dictionary  by the proxy receiver to determine the origin of the connection. Each
              generated file will be automatically deleted when the proxied connection is torn down.

              Not implemented on Windows.

       <b>--push</b> <u>option</u>
              Push a config file option back to the client for  remote  execution.  Note  that  <b>option</b>  must  be
              enclosed  in  double  quotes  (<b>""</b>).  The client must specify <b>--pull</b> in its config file. The set of
              options which can be pushed is limited by both feasibility and  security.  Some  options  such  as
              those  which  would  execute  scripts are banned, since they would effectively allow a compromised
              server to execute arbitrary code on the client. Other options such as TLS or MTU parameters cannot
              be pushed because the client needs to know them  before  the  connection  to  the  server  can  be
              initiated.

              This  is  a  partial  list  of  options  which  can currently be pushed: <b>--route</b>, <b>--route-gateway</b>,
              <b>--route-delay</b>,  <b>--redirect-gateway</b>,  <b>--ip-win32</b>,   <b>--dhcp-option</b>,   <b>--dns</b>,   <b>--inactive</b>,   <b>--ping</b>,
              <b>--ping-exit</b>,   <b>--ping-restart</b>,   <b>--setenv</b>,  <b>--auth-token</b>,  <b>--persist-key</b>,  <b>--persist-tun</b>,  <b>--echo</b>,
              <b>--comp-lzo</b>, <b>--socket-flags</b>, <b>--sndbuf</b>, <b>--rcvbuf</b>, <b>--session-timeout</b>

       <b>--push-remove</b> <u>opt</u>
              Selectively remove all <b>--push</b> options matching "opt" from the option list for  a  client.  <b>opt</b>  is
              matched  as  a  substring  against  the  whole  option  string  to-be-pushed  to  the  client,  so
              <b>--push-remove</b> <b>route</b> would remove all <b>--push</b> <b>route</b> <b>...</b> and <b>--push</b> <b>route-ipv6</b> <b>...</b>  statements, while
              <b>--push-remove</b> <b>"route-ipv6</b> <b>2001:"</b> would only remove IPv6 routes for <b>2001:...</b> networks.

              <b>--push-remove</b> can only be used in a client-specific context, like in a  <b>--client-config-dir</b>  file,
              or <b>--client-connect</b> script or plugin -- similar to <b>--push-reset</b>, just more selective.

              <u>NOTE</u>: to <u>change</u> an option, <b>--push-remove</b> can be used to first remove the old value, and then add a
              new <b>--push</b> option with the new value.

              <u>NOTE</u>  <u>2</u>: due to implementation details, 'ifconfig' and 'ifconfig-ipv6' can only be removed with an
              exact match on the option ( <b>push-remove</b> <b>ifconfig</b>), no substring matching and no  matching  on  the
              IPv4/IPv6 address argument is possible.

       <b>--push-reset</b>
              Don't  inherit  the  global  push  list  for a specific client instance.  Specify this option in a
              client-specific context such as with a <b>--client-config-dir</b> configuration file.  This  option  will
              ignore <b>--push</b> options at the global config file level.

              <u>NOTE</u>:  <b>--push-reset</b>  is  very  thorough:  it  will  remove  almost  all  options  from the list of
              to-be-pushed options.  In many cases,  some  of  these  options  will  need  to  be  re-configured
              afterwards - specifically, <b>--topology</b> <b>subnet</b> and <b>--route-gateway</b> will get lost and this will break
              client  configs  in  many  cases.   Thus,  for  most  purposes,  <b>--push-remove</b> is better suited to
              selectively remove push options for individual clients.

       <b>--server</b> <u>args</u>
              A helper directive designed to simplify the configuration of OpenVPN's server mode. This directive
              will set up an OpenVPN  server  which  will  allocate  addresses  to  clients  out  of  the  given
              network/netmask.  The  server  itself will take the <b>.1</b> address of the given network for use as the
              server-side endpoint of the local TUN/TAP interface. If the optional  <b>nopool</b>  flag  is  given,  no
              dynamic IP address pool will prepared for VPN clients.

              Valid syntax:

                 server network netmask [nopool]

              For example, <b>--server</b> <b>10.8.0.0</b> <b>255.255.255.0</b> expands as follows:

                 mode server
                 tls-server
                 push "topology [topology]"

                 if dev tun AND (topology == net30 OR topology == p2p):
                   ifconfig 10.8.0.1 10.8.0.2
                   if !nopool:
                     ifconfig-pool 10.8.0.4 10.8.0.251
                   route 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0
                   if client-to-client:
                     push "route 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0"
                   else if topology == net30:
                     push "route 10.8.0.1"

                 if dev tap OR (dev tun AND topology == subnet):
                   ifconfig 10.8.0.1 255.255.255.0
                   if !nopool:
                     ifconfig-pool 10.8.0.2 10.8.0.253 255.255.255.0
                   push "route-gateway 10.8.0.1"
                   if route-gateway unset:
                     route-gateway 10.8.0.2

              Don't use <b>--server</b> if you are ethernet bridging. Use <b>--server-bridge</b> instead.

       <b>--server-bridge</b> <u>args</u>
              A  helper  directive  similar  to  <b>--server</b>  which  is  designed  to simplify the configuration of
              OpenVPN's server mode in ethernet bridging configurations.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 server-bridge gateway netmask pool-start-IP pool-end-IP
                 server-bridge [nogw]

              If <b>--server-bridge</b> is used without any  parameters,  it  will  enable  a  DHCP-proxy  mode,  where
              connecting  OpenVPN  clients will receive an IP address for their TAP adapter from the DHCP server
              running on the OpenVPN server-side LAN. Note that only clients that support the binding of a  DHCP
              client  with  the  TAP  adapter  (such  as  Windows) can support this mode. The optional <b>nogw</b> flag
              (advanced) indicates that gateway information should not be pushed to the client.

              To configure ethernet bridging, you must first use your OS's bridging capability to bridge the TAP
              interface with the ethernet NIC interface.  For example, on Linux this  is  done  with  the  <b>brctl</b>
              tool,  and  with  Windows XP it is done in the Network Connections Panel by selecting the ethernet
              and TAP adapters and right-clicking on "Bridge Connections".

              Next you you must manually set the IP/netmask on the bridge interface.  The  <b>gateway</b>  and  <b>netmask</b>
              parameters  to <b>--server-bridge</b> can be set to either the IP/netmask of the bridge interface, or the
              IP/netmask of the default gateway/router on the bridged subnet.

              Finally, set aside a IP range in the bridged subnet, denoted by <b>pool-start-IP</b> and <b>pool-end-IP</b>, for
              OpenVPN to allocate to connecting clients.

              For example, <b>server-bridge</b> <b>10.8.0.4</b> <b>255.255.255.0</b> <b>10.8.0.128</b> <b>10.8.0.254</b> expands as follows:

                 mode server
                 tls-server

                 ifconfig-pool 10.8.0.128 10.8.0.254 255.255.255.0
                 push "route-gateway 10.8.0.4"

              In another example, <b>--server-bridge</b> (without parameters) expands as follows:

                 mode server
                 tls-server

                 push "route-gateway dhcp"

              Or <b>--server-bridge</b> <b>nogw</b> expands as follows:

                 mode server
                 tls-server

       <b>--server-ipv6</b> <u>args</u>
              Convenience-function to enable a number of IPv6 related options at once,  namely  <b>--ifconfig-ipv6</b>,
              <b>--ifconfig-ipv6-pool</b> and <b>--push</b> <b>tun-ipv6</b>.

              Valid syntax:

                 server-ipv6 ipv6addr/bits

              Pushing of the <b>--tun-ipv6</b> directive is done for older clients which require an explicit <b>--tun-ipv6</b>
              in their configuration.

       <b>--stale-routes-check</b> <u>args</u>
              Remove  routes which haven't had activity for <b>n</b> seconds (i.e. the ageing time).  This check is run
              every <b>t</b> seconds (i.e. check interval).

              Valid syntax:

                 stale-routes-check n [t]

              If <b>t</b> is not present it defaults to <b>n</b>.

              This option helps to keep the dynamic routing table small. See also <b>--max-routes-per-client</b>

       <b>--username-as-common-name</b>
              Use the authenticated username as the common-name, rather than the  common-name  from  the  client
              certificate.  Requires  that  some  form  of  <b>--auth-user-pass</b>  verification  is in effect. As the
              replacement happens after <b>--auth-user-pass</b> verification, the verification script  or  plugin  will
              still receive the common-name from the certificate.

              The  common_name  environment  variable passed to scripts and plugins invoked after authentication
              (e.g, client-connect script) and file names parsed  in  client-config  directory  will  match  the
              username.

       <b>--verify-client-cert</b> <u>mode</u>
              Specify whether the client is required to supply a valid certificate.

              Possible <b>mode</b> options are:

              <b>none</b>   A   client   certificate   is   not  required.  the  client  needs  to  authenticate  using
                     username/password only. Be aware that using this directive is less  secure  than  requiring
                     certificates from all clients.

                     If  you  use  this directive, the entire responsibility of authentication will rest on your
                     <b>--auth-user-pass-verify</b> script, so keep in mind that bugs in your script could  potentially
                     compromise the security of your VPN.

                     <b>--verify-client-cert</b> <b>none</b> is functionally equivalent to <b>--client-cert-not-required</b>.

              <b>optional</b>
                     A  client  may  present  a  certificate  but  it is not required to do so.  When using this
                     directive, you should also use a <b>--auth-user-pass-verify</b> script to ensure that clients  are
                     authenticated using a certificate, a username and password, or possibly even both.

                     Again,    the    entire    responsibility    of    authentication   will   rest   on   your
                     <b>--auth-user-pass-verify</b> script, so keep in mind that bugs in your script could  potentially
                     compromise the security of your VPN.

              <b>require</b>
                     This  is  the  default option. A client is required to present a certificate, otherwise VPN
                     access is refused.

              If you don't use this directive (or use <b>--verify-client-cert</b> <b>require</b>)  but  you  also  specify  an
              <b>--auth-user-pass-verify</b>  script,  then  OpenVPN  will  perform  double  authentication. The client
              certificate verification AND the <b>--auth-user-pass-verify</b> script will need to succeed in order  for
              a client to be authenticated and accepted onto the VPN.

       <b>--vlan-tagging</b>
              Server-only option. Turns the OpenVPN server instance into a switch that understands VLAN-tagging,
              based on IEEE 802.1Q.

              The  server  TAP  device  and  each of the connecting clients is seen as a port of the switch. All
              client ports are in untagged mode and the server TAP device is VLAN-tagged,  untagged  or  accepts
              both, depending on the <b>--vlan-accept</b> setting.

              Ethernet  frames  with  a  prepended  802.1Q tag are called "tagged". If the VLAN Identifier (VID)
              field in such a tag is non-zero, the frame is called "VLAN-tagged". If the VID is  zero,  but  the
              Priority  Control Point (PCP) field is non-zero, the frame is called "prio-tagged". If there is no
              802.1Q tag, the frame is "untagged".

              Using the <b>--vlan-pvid</b> <b>v</b> option once  per  client  (see  --client-config-dir),  each  port  can  be
              associated  with  a certain VID.  Packets can only be forwarded between ports having the same VID.
              Therefore, clients with  differing  VIDs  are  completely  separated  from  one-another,  even  if
              <b>--client-to-client</b> is activated.

              The  packet  filtering takes place in the OpenVPN server. Clients should not have any VLAN tagging
              configuration applied.

              The <b>--vlan-tagging</b> option is off by default. While turned off, OpenVPN accepts any Ethernet  frame
              and does not perform any special processing for VLAN-tagged packets.

              This option can only be activated in <b>--dev</b> <b>tap</b> <b>mode</b>.

       <b>--vlan-accept</b> <u>args</u>
              Configure the VLAN tagging policy for the server TAP device.

              Valid syntax:

                 vlan-accept  all|tagged|untagged

              The following modes are available:

              <b>tagged</b> Admit  only  VLAN-tagged  frames.  Only VLAN-tagged packets are accepted, while untagged or
                     priority-tagged packets are dropped when entering the server TAP device.

              <b>untagged</b>
                     Admit only untagged and prio-tagged frames.  VLAN-tagged packets are  not  accepted,  while
                     untagged  or  priority-tagged  packets  entering  the server TAP device are tagged with the
                     value configured for the global <b>--vlan-pvid</b> setting.

              <b>all</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     Admit all frames.  All packets are admitted and then treated like untagged or  tagged  mode
                     respectively.

              <u>Note</u><b>:</b>  Some vendors refer to switch ports running in <b>tagged</b> mode as "trunk ports" and switch ports
                     running in <b>untagged</b> mode as "access ports".

              Packets  forwarded  from clients to the server are VLAN-tagged with the originating client's PVID,
              unless the VID matches the global <b>--vlan-pvid</b>, in which case the tag is removed.

              If no <u>PVID</u> is configured for a given client  (see  --vlan-pvid)  packets  are  tagged  with  1  by
              default.

       <b>--vlan-pvid</b> <u>v</u>
              Specifies  which  VLAN  identifier  a "port" is associated with. Only valid when <b>--vlan-tagging</b> is
              specified.

              In the client context, the setting specifies which VLAN ID a client is  associated  with.  In  the
              global  context,  the  VLAN  ID  of  the server TAP device is set. The latter only makes sense for
              <b>--vlan-accept</b> <b>untagged</b> and <b>--vlan-accept</b> <b>all</b> modes.

              Valid values for <b>v</b> go from <b>1</b> through to <b>4094</b>. The global value defaults to <b>1</b>. If no <b>--vlan-pvid</b> is
              specified in the client context, the global value is inherited.

              In some switch implementations, the <u>PVID</u> is also referred to as "Native VLAN".

              Examples:

                 $ openvpn --genkey secret shared.key
                 $ openvpn --genkey tls-crypt shared.key
                 $ openvpn --genkey tls-auth shared.key

              • Generating <u>Shared</u> <u>Secret</u> <u>Keys</u> Generate a shared secret, for use with the <b>--secret</b>, <b>--tls-auth</b> or
                <b>--tls-crypt</b> options.

                Syntax:

                   $ openvpn --genkey secret|tls-crypt|tls-auth keyfile

                The key is saved in <b>keyfile</b>. All three variants (<b>--secret</b>, <b>tls-crypt</b> and <b>tls-auth</b>) generate  the
                same type of key. The aliases are added for convenience.

                If  using  this  for <b>--secret</b>, this file must be shared with the peer over a pre-existing secure
                channel such as <b><a href="../man1/scp.1.html">scp</a></b>(1).

              • Generating <u>TLS</u> <u>Crypt</u> <u>v2</u> <u>Server</u> <u>key</u> Generate a <b>--tls-crypt-v2</b>  key  to  be  used  by  an  OpenVPN
                server.  The key is stored in <b>keyfile</b>.

                Syntax:

                   --genkey tls-crypt-v2-server keyfile

              • Generating  <u>TLS</u> <u>Crypt</u> <u>v2</u> <u>Client</u> <u>key</u> Generate a --tls-crypt-v2 key to be used by OpenVPN clients.
                The key is stored in <b>keyfile</b>.

                Syntax

                   --genkey tls-crypt-v2-client keyfile [metadata]

                If supplied, include the supplied <b>metadata</b> in the wrapped client  key.  This  metadata  must  be
                supplied  in base64-encoded form. The metadata must be at most 733 bytes long (980 characters in
                base64, though note that 980 base64 characters can encode more than 733 bytes).

                If no metadata is supplied, OpenVPN will use a 64-bit unix timestamp  representing  the  current
                time in UTC, encoded in network order, as metadata for the generated key.

                A tls-crypt-v2 client key is wrapped using a server key. To generate a client key, the user must
                therefore supply the server key using the <b>--tls-crypt-v2</b> option.

                Servers can use <b>--tls-crypt-v2-verify</b> to specify a metadata verification command.

              • Generate   <u>Authentication</u>   <u>Token</u>   <u>key</u>   Generate   a   new   secret  that  can  be  used  with
                <b>--auth-gen-token-secret</b>

                Syntax:

                   --genkey auth-token [keyfile]

                <u>Note:</u>  This file should be kept secret to the server as anyone that has access to this file will
                       be able to generate auth tokens that the OpenVPN server will accept as valid.

   <b>Data</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>Renegotiation</b>
       When running OpenVPN in client/server mode, the data channel will use a separate ephemeral encryption key
       which is rotated at regular intervals.

       <b>--reneg-bytes</b> <u>n</u>
              Renegotiate data channel key after  <b>n</b>  bytes  sent  or  received  (disabled  by  default  with  an
              exception,  see  below). OpenVPN allows the lifetime of a key to be expressed as a number of bytes
              encrypted/decrypted, a number of packets, or a number of seconds.  A  key  renegotiation  will  be
              forced if any of these three criteria are met by either peer.

              If  using  ciphers  with  cipher  block  sizes less than 128-bits, <b>--reneg-bytes</b> is set to 64MB by
              default, unless it is explicitly  disabled  by  setting  the  value  to  <b>0</b>,  but  this  is  <b>HIGHLY</b>
              <b>DISCOURAGED</b> as this is designed to add some protection against the SWEET32 attack vector. For more
              information see the <b>--cipher</b> option.

       <b>--reneg-pkts</b> <u>n</u>
              Renegotiate data channel key after <b>n</b> packets sent and received (disabled by default).

       <b>--reneg-sec</b> <u>args</u>
              Renegotiate  data  channel  key  after at most <b>max</b> seconds (default <b>3600</b>) and at least <b>min</b> seconds
              (default is 90% of <b>max</b> for servers, and equal to <b>max</b> for clients).

                 reneg-sec max [min]

              The effective <b>--reneg-sec</b> value used is per session pseudo-uniform-randomized between <b>min</b> and <b>max</b>.

              With the default value of <b>3600</b> this results in an effective per session value in the range of <b>3240</b>
              .. <b>3600</b> seconds for servers, or just 3600 for clients.

              When using dual-factor authentication, note that this default value may cause the end user  to  be
              challenged to reauthorize once per hour.

              Also,  keep in mind that this option can be used on both the client and server, and whichever uses
              the lower value will be the one  to  trigger  the  renegotiation.  A  common  mistake  is  to  set
              <b>--reneg-sec</b>  to  a  higher  value  on  either  the  client  or server, while the other side of the
              connection is still using the default value of <b>3600</b> seconds, meaning that the  renegotiation  will
              still  occur once per <b>3600</b> seconds. The solution is to increase --reneg-sec on both the client and
              server, or set it to <b>0</b> on one side of the connection (to disable), and to your chosen value on the
              other side.

   <b>TLS</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>Options</b>
       TLS mode is the most powerful crypto mode of OpenVPN in both security and flexibility. TLS mode works  by
       establishing  control  and  data  channels  which  are  multiplexed  over  a single TCP/UDP port. OpenVPN
       initiates a TLS session over the control channel and uses it to exchange cipher and HMAC keys to  protect
       the  data  channel.  TLS  mode  uses  a  robust reliability layer over the UDP connection for all control
       channel communication, while the data channel, over which encrypted  tunnel  data  passes,  is  forwarded
       without  any mediation. The result is the best of both worlds: a fast data channel that forwards over UDP
       with only the overhead of encrypt, decrypt, and HMAC functions, and a control channel that  provides  all
       of  the  security  features of TLS, including certificate-based authentication and Diffie Hellman forward
       secrecy.

       To use TLS mode, each peer that runs OpenVPN should have its own local certificate/key pair  (<b>--cert</b>  and
       <b>--key</b>), signed by the root certificate which is specified in <b>--ca</b>.

       When  two  OpenVPN  peers  connect, each presents its local certificate to the other. Each peer will then
       check that its partner peer presented a certificate which was signed by the master  root  certificate  as
       specified in <b>--ca</b>.

       If  that  check  on  both  peers succeeds, then the TLS negotiation will succeed, both OpenVPN peers will
       exchange temporary session keys, and the tunnel will begin passing data.

       The  OpenVPN  project  provides  a  set  of   scripts   for   managing   RSA   certificates   and   keys:
       <u>https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa</u>

       <b>--askpass</b> <u>file</u>
              Get certificate password from console or <b>file</b> before we daemonize.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 askpass
                 askpass file

              For  the extremely security conscious, it is possible to protect your private key with a password.
              Of course this means that every time the OpenVPN daemon is started you must be there to  type  the
              password.  The  <b>--askpass</b> option allows you to start OpenVPN from the command line.  It will query
              you for a password before it daemonizes. To protect a private key with a password you should  omit
              the  <b>-nodes</b>  option  when you use the <b>openssl</b> command line tool to manage certificates and private
              keys.

              If <b>file</b> is specified, read the password from the first line of <b>file</b>. Keep  in  mind  that  storing
              your  password  in  a file to a certain extent invalidates the extra security provided by using an
              encrypted key.

       <b>--ca</b> <u>file</u>
              Certificate authority (CA) file in .pem format, also referred to as  the  <u>root</u>  certificate.  This
              file  can have multiple certificates in .pem format, concatenated together. You can construct your
              own certificate authority certificate and private key by using a command such as:

                 openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt

              Then edit your openssl.cnf file and edit the <b>certificate</b>  variable  to  point  to  your  new  root
              certificate <b>ca.crt</b>.

              For  testing purposes only, the OpenVPN distribution includes a sample CA certificate (ca.crt). Of
              course you should never use the test certificates and test keys  distributed  with  OpenVPN  in  a
              production  environment,  since by virtue of the fact that they are distributed with OpenVPN, they
              are totally insecure.

       <b>--capath</b> <u>dir</u>
              Directory containing trusted certificates (CAs and CRLs). Not available with mbed TLS.

              CAs in the capath directory are expected to be named &lt;hash&gt;.&lt;n&gt;. CRLs are  expected  to  be  named
              &lt;hash&gt;.r&lt;n&gt;.  See  the  <b>-CApath</b>  option  of  <b>openssl</b> <b>verify</b>, and the <b>-hash</b> option of <b>openssl</b> <b>x509</b>,
              <b>openssl</b> <b>crl</b> and <b>X509_LOOKUP_hash_dir()</b>(3) for more information.

              Similar to the <b>--crl-verify</b> option, CRLs are not mandatory - OpenVPN will log the usual warning in
              the logs if the relevant CRL is missing, but the connection will be allowed.

       <b>--cert</b> <u>file</u>
              Local peer's signed certificate in .pem format -- must be signed by a certificate authority  whose
              certificate  is in <b>--ca</b> <b>file</b>. Each peer in an OpenVPN link running in TLS mode should have its own
              certificate and private key file. In addition, each certificate should have been signed by the key
              of a certificate authority whose public key resides in the <b>--ca</b> certificate  authority  file.  You
              can  easily  make  your  own  certificate  authority  (see above) or pay money to use a commercial
              service such as thawte.com (in which case you will be helping to finance the world's second  space
              tourist :). To generate a certificate, you can use a command such as:

                 openssl req -nodes -new -keyout mycert.key -out mycert.csr

              If  your  certificate authority private key lives on another machine, copy the certificate signing
              request (mycert.csr) to this other machine (this can be done over  an  insecure  channel  such  as
              email). Now sign the certificate with a command such as:

                 openssl ca -out mycert.crt -in mycert.csr

              Now  copy  the  certificate  (mycert.crt) back to the peer which initially generated the .csr file
              (this can be over a public medium). Note that the <b>openssl</b> <b>ca</b> command reads  the  location  of  the
              certificate  authority  key from its configuration file such as <b>/usr/share/ssl/openssl.cnf</b> -- note
              also that for certificate authority functions, you must set up the files <b>index.txt</b> (may be  empty)
              and <b>serial</b> (initialize to <b>01</b>).

       <b>--crl-verify</b> <u>args</u>
              Check peer certificate against a Certificate Revocation List.

              Valid syntax:

                 crl-verify file/directory flag

              Examples:

                 crl-verify crl-file.pem
                 crl-verify /etc/openvpn/crls dir

              A  CRL  (certificate  revocation  list)  is used when a particular key is compromised but when the
              overall PKI is still intact.

              Suppose you had a PKI consisting of a CA, root certificate, and a number of  client  certificates.
              Suppose a laptop computer containing a client key and certificate was stolen. By adding the stolen
              certificate  to  the  CRL  file,  you  could reject any connection which attempts to use it, while
              preserving the overall integrity of the PKI.

              The only time when it would be necessary to rebuild the entire PKI from scratch would  be  if  the
              root certificate key itself was compromised.

              The  option  is  not mandatory - if the relevant CRL is missing, OpenVPN will log a warning in the
              logs - e.g.

                 VERIFY WARNING: depth=0, unable to get certificate CRL

              but the connection will be allowed.  If the optional <b>dir</b> flag is  specified,  enable  a  different
              mode  where  the  <b>crl-verify</b>  is  pointed  at a directory containing files named as revoked serial
              numbers (the files may be empty, the contents are never read). If a client requests a  connection,
              where  the  client certificate serial number (decimal string) is the name of a file present in the
              directory, it will be rejected.

              <u>Note:</u>  As the crl file (or directory) is read every time a peer connects, if you are dropping root
                     privileges with <b>--user</b>, make sure that this user has  sufficient  privileges  to  read  the
                     file.

       <b>--dh</b> <u>file</u>
              File containing Diffie Hellman parameters in .pem format (required for <b>--tls-server</b> only).

              Set  <b>file</b>  to  <b>none</b>  to  disable  Diffie  Hellman key exchange (and use ECDH only). Note that this
              requires peers to be using an SSL library that supports  ECDH  TLS  cipher  suites  (e.g.  OpenSSL
              1.0.1+, or mbed TLS 2.0+).

              Use  <b>openssl</b>  <b>dhparam</b>  <b>-out</b>  <b>dh2048.pem</b>  <b>2048</b>  to  generate 2048-bit DH parameters. Diffie Hellman
              parameters may be considered public.

       <b>--ecdh-curve</b> <u>name</u>
              Specify the curve to use for elliptic curve Diffie Hellman. Available curves can  be  listed  with
              <b>--show-curves</b>. The specified curve will only be used for ECDH TLS-ciphers.

              This option is not supported in mbed TLS builds of OpenVPN.

       <b>--extra-certs</b> <u>file</u>
              Specify  a  <b>file</b>  containing one or more PEM certs (concatenated together) that complete the local
              certificate chain.

              This option is useful for "split" CAs, where the CA for server certs is different than the CA  for
              client  certs. Putting certs in this file allows them to be used to complete the local certificate
              chain without trusting them to verify the peer-submitted certificate, as would be the case if  the
              certs were placed in the <b>ca</b> file.

       <b>--hand-window</b> <u>n</u>
              Handshake  Window  --  the  TLS-based  key  exchange  must  finalize within <b>n</b> seconds of handshake
              initiation by any peer (default <b>60</b> seconds). If the handshake fails we will attempt to  reset  our
              connection  with  our peer and try again. Even in the event of handshake failure we will still use
              our expiring key for up to <b>--tran-window</b> seconds to maintain continuity of transmission of  tunnel
              data.

              The  <b>--hand-window</b>  parameter also controls the amount of time that the OpenVPN client repeats the
              pull request until it times out.

       <b>--key</b> <u>file</u>
              Local peer's private key in .pem format. Use the private key which was generated  when  you  built
              your peer's certificate (see <b>--cert</b> <b>file</b> above).

       <b>--pkcs12</b> <u>file</u>
              Specify  a PKCS #12 file containing local private key, local certificate, and root CA certificate.
              This option can be used instead of <b>--ca</b>, <b>--cert</b>, and <b>--key</b>.  Not available with mbed TLS.

       <b>--remote-cert-eku</b> <u>oid</u>
              Require that peer certificate was signed with an explicit <u>extended</u> <u>key</u> <u>usage</u>.

              This is a useful security option for clients, to ensure  that  the  host  they  connect  to  is  a
              designated server.

              The extended key usage should be encoded in <u>oid</u> <u>notation</u>, or <u>OpenSSL</u> <u>symbolic</u> <u>representation</u>.

       <b>--remote-cert-ku</b> <u>key-usage</u>
              Require that peer certificate was signed with an explicit <b>key-usage</b>.

              If  present  in the certificate, the <b>keyUsage</b> value is validated by the TLS library during the TLS
              handshake. Specifying this option without arguments requires this extension to be present (so  the
              TLS library will verify it).

              If  <b>key-usage</b>  is a list of usage bits, the <b>keyUsage</b> field must have <u>at</u> <u>least</u> the same bits set as
              the bits in <u>one</u> <u>of</u> the values supplied in the <b>key-usage</b> list.

              The <b>key-usage</b> values in the list must be encoded in hex, e.g.

                 remote-cert-ku a0

       <b>--remote-cert-tls</b> <u>type</u>
              Require that peer certificate was signed with an explicit <u>key</u> <u>usage</u> and <u>extended</u> <u>key</u>  <u>usage</u>  based
              on RFC3280 TLS rules.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 remote-cert-tls server
                 remote-cert-tls client

              This  is  a  useful  security  option  for  clients,  to ensure that the host they connect to is a
              designated server. Or the other way around; for a server to verify that only hosts with  a  client
              certificate can connect.

              The <b>--remote-cert-tls</b> <b>client</b> option is equivalent to

                 remote-cert-ku
                 remote-cert-eku "TLS Web Client Authentication"

              The <b>--remote-cert-tls</b> <b>server</b> option is equivalent to

                 remote-cert-ku
                 remote-cert-eku "TLS Web Server Authentication"

              This  is  an  important security precaution to protect against a man-in-the-middle attack where an
              authorized client attempts to connect to another client by impersonating the server. The attack is
              easily  prevented  by  having  clients  verify  the  server   certificate   using   any   one   of
              <b>--remote-cert-tls</b>, <b>--verify-x509-name</b>, <b>--peer-fingerprint</b> or <b>--tls-verify</b>.

       <b>--tls-auth</b> <u>args</u>
              Add  an  additional layer of HMAC authentication on top of the TLS control channel to mitigate DoS
              attacks and attacks on the TLS stack.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 tls-auth file
                 tls-auth file 0
                 tls-auth file 1

              In a nutshell, <b>--tls-auth</b> enables a kind of "HMAC firewall" on OpenVPN's TCP/UDP port,  where  TLS
              control  channel  packets  bearing  an incorrect HMAC signature can be dropped immediately without
              response.

              <b>file</b> (required) is a file in OpenVPN static key format which can be generated by <b>--genkey</b>.

              Older versions (up to OpenVPN 2.3) supported a  freeform  passphrase  file.   This  is  no  longer
              supported in newer versions (v2.4+).

              See the <b>--secret</b> option for more information on the optional <b>direction</b> parameter.

              <b>--tls-auth</b> is recommended when you are running OpenVPN in a mode where it is listening for packets
              from  any  IP  address,  such  as  when  <b>--remote</b>  is not specified, or <b>--remote</b> is specified with
              <b>--float</b>.

              The rationale for this feature is as follows. TLS requires a multi-packet exchange  before  it  is
              able  to  authenticate  a  peer.  During  this  time  before authentication, OpenVPN is allocating
              resources (memory and CPU) to this potential peer. The potential peer is also exposing many  parts
              of  OpenVPN  and the OpenSSL library to the packets it is sending. Most successful network attacks
              today seek to either exploit bugs in programs (such as buffer overflow attacks) or force a program
              to consume so many resources that it becomes unusable. Of course the  first  line  of  defense  is
              always  to  produce clean, well-audited code. OpenVPN has been written with buffer overflow attack
              prevention as a top priority. But as history has shown, many  of  the  most  widely  used  network
              applications have, from time to time, fallen to buffer overflow attacks.

              So  as a second line of defense, OpenVPN offers this special layer of authentication on top of the
              TLS control channel so that every packet on the  control  channel  is  authenticated  by  an  HMAC
              signature and a unique ID for replay protection. This signature will also help protect against DoS
              (Denial  of  Service) attacks. An important rule of thumb in reducing vulnerability to DoS attacks
              is to minimize the amount of resources a potential, but as yet unauthenticated, client is able  to
              consume.

              <b>--tls-auth</b> does this by signing every TLS control channel packet with an HMAC signature, including
              packets  which are sent before the TLS level has had a chance to authenticate the peer. The result
              is that packets without the correct signature can be dropped immediately  upon  reception,  before
              they  have  a chance to consume additional system resources such as by initiating a TLS handshake.
              <b>--tls-auth</b> can be strengthened by adding the <b>--replay-persist</b> option  which  will  keep  OpenVPN's
              replay protection state in a file so that it is not lost across restarts.

              It  should  be emphasized that this feature is optional and that the key file used with <b>--tls-auth</b>
              gives a peer nothing more than the power to initiate a TLS handshake. It is not used to encrypt or
              authenticate any tunnel data.

              Use <b>--tls-crypt</b> instead if you want to use the key file to not only authenticate, but also encrypt
              the TLS control channel.

       <b>--tls-groups</b> <u>list</u>
              A list of allowable groups/curves in order of preference.

              Set the allowed elliptic curves/groups for the TLS session.  These groups are allowed to  be  used
              in signatures and key exchange.

              mbedTLS currently allows all known curves per default.

              OpenSSL 1.1+ restricts the list per default to

                 "X25519:secp256r1:X448:secp521r1:secp384r1".

              If  you  use certificates that use non-standard curves, you might need to add them here. If you do
              not force the ecdh curve by using <b>--ecdh-curve</b>, the groups for ecdh will also be picked from  this
              list.

              OpenVPN maps the curve name <u>secp256r1</u> to <u>prime256v1</u> to allow specifying the same tls-groups option
              for mbedTLS and OpenSSL.

              Warning: this option not only affects elliptic curve certificates but also the key exchange in TLS
              1.3 and using this option improperly will disable TLS 1.3.

       <b>--tls-cert-profile</b> <u>profile</u>
              Set the allowed cryptographic algorithms for certificates according to <b>profile</b>.

              The following profiles are supported:

              <b>insecure</b>
                     Identical for mbed TLS to <u>legacy</u>

              <b>legacy</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     SHA1 and newer, RSA 2048-bit+, any elliptic curve.

              <b>preferred</b>
                     SHA2 and newer, RSA 2048-bit+, any elliptic curve.

              <b>suiteb</b> SHA256/SHA384, ECDSA with P-256 or P-384.

              This  option  is  only  fully  supported  for  mbed  TLS  builds. OpenSSL builds use the following
              approximation:

              <b>insecure</b>
                     sets "security level 0"

              <b>legacy</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     sets "security level 1"

              <b>preferred</b>
                     sets "security level 2"

              <b>suiteb</b> sets "security level 3" and <b>--tls-cipher</b> <b>"SUITEB128"</b>.

              OpenVPN will migrate to 'preferred' as default in the future. Please ensure that your keys already
              comply.

       <u>WARNING:</u> <b>--tls-ciphers,</b> <b>--tls-ciphersuites</b> <b>and</b> <b>tls-groups</b>
              These options are expert features, which - if used correctly - can improve the  security  of  your
              VPN  connection.  But  it  is also easy to unwittingly use them to carefully align a gun with your
              foot, or just break your connection. Use with care!

       <b>--tls-cipher</b> <u>l</u>
              A list <b>l</b> of allowable TLS ciphers delimited by a colon ("<b>:</b>").

              These setting can be used to ensure that certain cipher suites are used (or not used) for the  TLS
              connection.  OpenVPN  uses TLS to secure the control channel, over which the keys that are used to
              protect the actual VPN traffic are exchanged.

              The supplied list of ciphers is (after potential OpenSSL/IANA name translation) simply supplied to
              the crypto library. Please see the OpenSSL and/or mbed TLS documentation for details on the cipher
              list interpretation.

              For OpenSSL, the <b>--tls-cipher</b> is used for TLS 1.2 and below.

              Use <b>--show-tls</b> to see a list of TLS ciphers supported by your crypto library.

              The default for <b>--tls-cipher</b> is to use mbed TLS's default cipher  list  when  using  mbed  TLS  or
              <b>DEFAULT:!EXP:!LOW:!MEDIUM:!kDH:!kECDH:!DSS:!PSK:!SRP:!kRSA</b> when using OpenSSL.

       <b>--tls-ciphersuites</b> <u>l</u>
              Same  as  <b>--tls-cipher</b>  but  for  TLS 1.3 and up. mbed TLS has no TLS 1.3 support yet and only the
              <b>--tls-cipher</b> setting is used.

              The default for <u>--tls-ciphersuites</u> is to use the crypto library's default.

       <b>--tls-client</b>
              Enable TLS and assume client role during TLS handshake.

       <b>--tls-crypt</b> <u>keyfile</u>
              Encrypt and authenticate all control channel packets with the key from  <b>keyfile</b>.  (See  <b>--tls-auth</b>
              for more background.)

              Encrypting (and authenticating) control channel packets:

              • provides more privacy by hiding the certificate used for the TLS connection,

              • makes it harder to identify OpenVPN traffic as such,

              • provides  "poor-man's"  post-quantum  security,  against  attackers  who  will  never  know  the
                pre-shared key (i.e. no forward secrecy).

              In contrast to <b>--tls-auth</b>, <b>--tls-crypt</b> does <u>not</u> require the user to set <b>--key-direction</b>.

              <b>Security</b> <b>Considerations</b>

              All peers use the same <b>--tls-crypt</b> pre-shared  group  key  to  authenticate  and  encrypt  control
              channel  messages.  To  ensure  that IV collisions remain unlikely, this key should not be used to
              encrypt more than 2^48 client-to-server or  2^48  server-to-client  control  channel  messages.  A
              typical  initial  negotiation  is  about  10  packets  in  each  direction.  Assuming both initial
              negotiation and renegotiations are  at  most  2^16  (65536)  packets  (to  be  conservative),  and
              (re)negotiations  happen  each minute for each user (24/7), this limits the tls-crypt key lifetime
              to 8171 years divided by the number of users. So a setup with 1000 users should rotate the key  at
              least once each eight years. (And a setup with 8000 users each year.)

              If  IV collisions were to occur, this could result in the security of <b>--tls-crypt</b> degrading to the
              same security as using <b>--tls-auth</b>.  That is, the control channel still  benefits  from  the  extra
              protection against active man-in-the-middle-attacks and DoS attacks, but may no longer offer extra
              privacy and post-quantum security on top of what TLS itself offers.

              For  large  setups or setups where clients are not trusted, consider using <b>--tls-crypt-v2</b> instead.
              That uses per-client unique keys, and thereby improves the bounds to 'rotate a client key at least
              once per 8000 years'.

       <b>--tls-crypt-v2</b> <u>keyfile</u>
              Valid syntax:

                 tls-crypt-v2 keyfile
                 tls-crypt-v2 keyfile force-cookie
                 tls-crypt-v2 keyfile allow-noncookie

              Use client-specific tls-crypt keys.

              For clients, <b>keyfile</b> is a client-specific tls-crypt key. Such a key can  be  generated  using  the
              <b>--genkey</b> <b>tls-crypt-v2-client</b> option.

              For  servers,  <b>keyfile</b>  is  used  to  unwrap  client-specific  keys  supplied by the client during
              connection setup. This key must be the same as the key used to generate  the  client-specific  key
              (see <b>--genkey</b> <b>tls-crypt-v2-client</b>).

              On  servers,  this  option can be used together with the <b>--tls-auth</b> or <b>--tls-crypt</b> option. In that
              case, the server will detect whether the client is using client-specific keys,  and  automatically
              select the right mode.

              The  optional parameters <b>force-cookie</b> allows only tls-crypt-v2 clients that support a cookie based
              stateless three way handshake that avoids replay attacks and state exhaustion on the  server  side
              (OpenVPN  2.6 and later). The option <b>allow-noncookie</b> explicitly allows older tls-crypt-v2 clients.
              The default is (currently) <b>allow-noncookie</b>.

       <b>--tls-crypt-v2-verify</b> <u>cmd</u>
              Run command <b>cmd</b> to verify the metadata of the client-specific tls-crypt-v2  key  of  a  connecting
              client.  This  allows  server administrators to reject client connections, before exposing the TLS
              stack (including the notoriously dangerous X.509 and ASN.1 stacks) to the connecting client.

              OpenVPN supplies the following environment variables to the command (and only these variables. The
              normal environment variables available for other scripts are NOT present):

              • <b>script_type</b> is set to <b>tls-crypt-v2-verify</b>

              • <b>metadata_type</b> is set to <b>0</b> if the metadata was  user  supplied,  or  <b>1</b>  if  it's  a  64-bit  unix
                timestamp representing the key creation time.

              • <b>metadata_file</b> contains the filename of a temporary file that contains the client metadata.

              The command can reject the connection by exiting with a non-zero exit code.

       <b>--tls-exit</b>
              Exit  on TLS negotiation failure. This option can be useful when you only want to make one attempt
              at connecting, e.g. in a test or monitoring script.  (OpenVPN's own test suite uses it this way.)

       <b>--tls-server</b>
              Enable TLS and assume server role during TLS  handshake.  Note  that  OpenVPN  is  designed  as  a
              peer-to-peer  application.  The  designation  of  client  or  server  is  only  for the purpose of
              negotiating the TLS control channel.

       <b>--tls-timeout</b> <u>n</u>
              Packet retransmit timeout on TLS control channel if no acknowledgment from remote within <b>n</b> seconds
              (default <b>2</b>). When OpenVPN sends a control packet to  its  peer,  it  will  expect  to  receive  an
              acknowledgement  within  <b>n</b>  seconds  or  it  will  retransmit  the  packet,  subject to a TCP-like
              exponential backoff algorithm. This parameter  only  applies  to  control  channel  packets.  Data
              channel  packets  (which  carry  encrypted  tunnel  data)  are  never  acknowledged, sequenced, or
              retransmitted by OpenVPN because the higher level network protocols running on top of  the  tunnel
              such as TCP expect this role to be left to them.

       <b>--tls-version-min</b> <u>args</u>
              Sets the minimum TLS version we will accept from the peer (default in 2.6.0 and later is "1.2").

              Valid syntax:

                 tls-version-min version ['or-highest']

              Examples  for  version  include  <b>1.0</b>,  <b>1.1</b>,  or <b>1.2</b>. If <b>or-highest</b> is specified and version is not
              recognized, we will only accept the highest TLS version supported by the local SSL implementation.

       <b>--tls-version-max</b> <u>version</u>
              Set the maximum TLS version we will use (default is the highest version supported).  Examples  for
              version include <b>1.0</b>, <b>1.1</b>, or <b>1.2</b>.

       <b>--verify-hash</b> <u>args</u>
              <b>DEPRECATED</b> Specify SHA1 or SHA256 fingerprint for level-1 cert.

              Valid syntax:

                 verify-hash hash [algo]

              The  level-1  cert  is  the  CA (or intermediate cert) that signs the leaf certificate, and is one
              removed from the leaf certificate in the direction of the root. When accepting a connection from a
              peer, the level-1 cert fingerprint must match <b>hash</b> or certificate verification will fail. Hash  is
              specified as XX:XX:... For example:

                 AD:B0:95:D8:09:C8:36:45:12:A9:89:C8:90:09:CB:13:72:A6:AD:16

              The <b>algo</b> flag can be either <b>SHA1</b> or <b>SHA256</b>. If not provided, it defaults to <b>SHA1</b>.

              This option can also be inlined

                 &lt;verify-hash&gt;
                 00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff:00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
                 11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff:00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff:00
                 &lt;/verify-hash&gt;

       If the option is inlined, <b>algo</b> is always <b>SHA256</b>.

       <b>--peer-fingerprint</b> <u>args</u>
                 Specify  a  SHA256  fingerprint  or  list of SHA256 fingerprints to verify the peer certificate
                 against. The peer certificate must match one of the  fingerprint  or  certificate  verification
                 will fail. The option can also be inlined

              Valid syntax:

                 peer-fingerprint AD:B0:95:D8:09:...

              or inline:

                 &lt;peer-fingerprint&gt;
                 00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff:00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
                 11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff:00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff:00
                 &lt;/peer-fingerprint&gt;

              When  the  <b>--peer-fingerprint</b>  option  is used, specifying a CA with <b>--ca</b> or <b>--capath</b> is optional.
              This allows the he <b>--peer-fingerprint</b> to  be  used  as  alternative  to  a  PKI  with  self-signed
              certificates for small setups. See the examples section for such a setup.

       <b>--verify-x509-name</b> <u>args</u>
              Accept  connections  only  if a host's X.509 name is equal to <b>name.</b> The remote host must also pass
              all other tests of verification.

              Valid syntax:

                 verify-x509 name type

              Which X.509 name is compared to <b>name</b> depends on the setting of type.  <b>type</b> can be <b>subject</b> to match
              the complete subject DN (default), <b>name</b> to match a subject RDN or <b>name-prefix</b> to match  a  subject
              RDN  prefix.  Which  RDN  is  verified as name depends on the <b>--x509-username-field</b> option. But it
              defaults to the common name (CN), e.g. a certificate with a subject DN

                 C=KG, ST=NA, L=Bishkek, CN=Server-1

              would be matched by:

                 verify-x509-name 'C=KG, ST=NA, L=Bishkek, CN=Server-1'
                 verify-x509-name Server-1 name
                 verify-x509-name Server- name-prefix

              The last example is useful if you want a client to only accept connections to <b>Server-1</b>,  <b>Server-2</b>,
              etc.

              <b>--verify-x509-name</b>  is a useful replacement for the <b>--tls-verify</b> option to verify the remote host,
              because <b>--verify-x509-name</b> works in a <b>--chroot</b> environment without any dependencies.

              Using a name prefix is a useful alternative to managing a CRL (Certificate Revocation List) on the
              client, since it allows the client to refuse all certificates except  for  those  associated  with
              designated servers.

              <u>NOTE:</u>  Test  against  a  name  prefix only when you are using OpenVPN with a custom CA certificate
                     that is under your control. Never use this option with type <b>name-prefix</b>  when  your  client
                     certificates are signed by a third party, such as a commercial web CA.

       <b>--x509-track</b> <u>attribute</u>
              Save peer X509 <b>attribute</b> value in environment for use by plugins and management interface. Prepend
              a  <b>+</b>  to  <b>attribute</b>  to  save  values  from  full cert chain. Otherwise the attribute will only be
              exported for the leaf cert  (i.e.  depth  <b>0</b>  of  the  cert  chain).  Values  will  be  encoded  as
              <b>X509_&lt;depth&gt;_&lt;attribute&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b>.  Multiple  <b>--x509-track</b> options can be defined to track multiple
              attributes.

              <b>attribute</b> can be any part of the X509 Subject field or any X509v3  extension  (RFC  3280).  X509v3
              extensions  might  not  be supported when not using the default TLS backend library (OpenSSL). You
              can also request the <b>SHA1</b> and <b>SHA256</b> fingerprints of the cert, but  that  is  always  exported  as
              <b>tls_digest_{n}</b> and <b>tls_digest_sha256_{n}</b> anyway.

              Note  that  by default <b>all</b> parts of the X509 Subject field are exported in the environment for the
              whole cert chain. If you use <b>--x509-track</b> at least once <b>only</b> the  attributes  specified  by  these
              options are exported.

              Examples:

                 x509-track CN               # exports only X509_0_CN
                 x509-track +CN              # exports X509_{n}_CN for chain
                 x509-track basicConstraints # exports value of "X509v3 Basic Constraints"
                 x509-track SHA256           # exports SHA256 fingerprint

       <b>--x509-username-field</b> <u>args</u>
              Fields  in  the  X.509  certificate  subject  to be used as the username (default <b>CN</b>). If multiple
              fields are specified their values will be concatenated into the one username using <b>_</b> symbol  as  a
              separator.

              Valid syntax:

                 x509-username-field [ext:]fieldname [[ext:]fieldname...]

              Typically, this option is specified with <b>fieldname</b> arguments as either of the following:

                 x509-username-field emailAddress
                 x509-username-field ext:subjectAltName
                 x509-username-field CN serialNumber

              The  first example uses the value of the <b>emailAddress</b> attribute in the certificate's Subject field
              as the username. The second example uses the <b>ext:</b> prefix  to  signify  that  the  X.509  extension
              <b>fieldname</b>  <b>subjectAltName</b>  be searched for an rfc822Name (email) field to be used as the username.
              In cases where there are multiple email addresses in <b>ext:fieldname</b>, the last occurrence is chosen.
              The last example uses the value of the <b>CN</b> attribute in the Subject  field,  combined  with  the  <b>_</b>
              separator and the hexadecimal representation of the certificate's <b>serialNumber</b>.

              When  this  option  is used, the <b>--verify-x509-name</b> option will match against the chosen <b>fieldname</b>
              instead of the Common Name.

              Only the <b>subjectAltName</b> and <b>issuerAltName</b> X.509 extensions and <b>serialNumber</b>  X.509  attribute  are
              supported.

              <b>Please</b>  <b>note:</b> This option has a feature which will convert an all-lowercase <b>fieldname</b> to uppercase
              characters, e.g., <b>ou</b> -&gt; <b>OU</b>. A mixed-case <b>fieldname</b> or one having the  <b>ext:</b>  prefix  will  be  left
              as-is. This automatic upcasing feature is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

              Non-compliant  symbols  are  being  replaced  with  the  <b>_</b> symbol, same as the field separator, so
              concatenating multiple fields with such or <b>_</b> symbols can potentially lead to username collisions.

   <b>PKCS#11</b> <b>/</b> <b>SmartCard</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>--pkcs11-cert-private</b> <u>args</u>
              Set if access to certificate object should be performed after login.  Every provider has  its  own
              setting.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 pkcs11-cert-private 1

       <b>--pkcs11-id</b> <u>name</u>

       <b>--pkcs11-id-management</b>
              Acquire PKCS#11 id  from  management  interface.  In  this  case  a  <b>NEED-STR</b>  <b>'pkcs11-id-request'</b>
              real-time  message  will  be  triggered,  application  may use pkcs11-id-count command to retrieve
              available number of certificates,  and  pkcs11-id-get  command  to  retrieve  certificate  id  and

              following:

              <b>0</b> (default)   Try to determine automatically.

              <b>1</b>             Use sign.

       <b>--pkcs11-protected-authentication</b> <u>args</u>
              Use PKCS#11 protected authentication path, useful for biometric and external keypad devices. Every
              provider has its own setting.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 pkcs11-protected-authentication 0
                 pkcs11-protected-authentication 1

       <b>--pkcs11-providers</b> <u>providers</u>
              Specify  an RSA Security Inc. PKCS #11 Cryptographic Token Interface (Cryptoki) providers to load.
              A space-separated list of one or more provider library names may be specified. This  option  along
              with <b>--pkcs11-id</b> or <b>pkcs11-id-management</b> can be used instead of <b>--cert</b> and <b>--key</b> or <b>--pkcs12</b>.

              If p11-kit is present on the system and was enabled during build, its <b>p11-kit-proxy.so</b> module will
              be  loaded  by  default  if  either  the  <b>--pkcs11-id</b> or <b>--pkcs11-id-management</b> options is present
              without <b>--pkcs11-providers</b>. If default loading is not enabled in the build and  no  providers  are
              specified, the former options will be ignored.

       <b>--show-pkcs11-ids</b> <u>args</u>
              (Standalone) Show PKCS#11 token object list.

              Valid syntax:

                 show-pkcs11 [provider] [cert_private]

              Specify <b>cert_private</b> as <b>1</b> if certificates are stored as private objects.

              If  <u>p11-kit</u>  is  present  on the system, the <b>provider</b> argument is optional; if omitted the default

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>CHANNEL</b> <b>CIPHER</b> <b>NEGOTIATION</b></h4><pre>
       OpenVPN 2.4 and higher have the capability to negotiate the data cipher that  is  used  to  encrypt  data
       packets.  This  section  describes the mechanism in more detail and the different backwards compatibility
       mechanism with older server and clients.

   <b>OpenVPN</b> <b>2.5</b> <b>and</b> <b>later</b> <b>behaviour</b>
       When both client and server are at least running OpenVPN 2.5, that  the  order  of  the  ciphers  of  the
       server's  <b>--data-ciphers</b>  is used to pick the data cipher.  That means that the first cipher in that list
       that is also in the client's <b>--data-ciphers</b> list is chosen. If no common cipher is found  the  client  is
       rejected with a AUTH_FAILED message (as seen in client log):
          AUTH: Received control message: AUTH_FAILED,Data channel cipher negotiation failed (no shared cipher)

       OpenVPN  2.5 and later will only allow the ciphers specified in <b>--data-ciphers</b>.  If <b>--data-ciphers</b> is not
       set  the  default  is  <b>AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM</b>.   In  2.6  and  later   the   default   is   changed   to
       <b>AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM:CHACHA20-POLY1305</b> when Chacha20-Poly1305 is available.

       For  backwards  compatibility  OpenVPN  2.6 and later with <b>--compat-mode</b> <b>2.4.x</b> (or lower) and OpenVPN 2.5
       will automatically add a cipher specified using the <b>--cipher</b> option to this list.

   <b>OpenVPN</b> <b>2.4</b> <b>clients</b>
       The negotiation support in OpenVPN 2.4 was the first iteration of the implementation and still  had  some
       quirks.  Its  main  goal was "upgrade to AES-256-GCM when possible".  An OpenVPN 2.4 client that is built
       against a crypto library that supports AES in GCM mode  and  does  not  have  <b>--ncp-disable</b>  will  always
       announce support for <u>AES-256-GCM</u> and <u>AES-128-GCM</u> to a server by sending <b>IV_NCP=2</b>.

       This   only   causes   a   problem  if  <b>--ncp-ciphers</b>  option  has  been  changed  from  the  default  of
       <b>AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM</b> to a value that does not include these two ciphers. When an OpenVPN server  tries
       to  use  <u>AES-256-GCM</u>  or <u>AES-128-GCM</u> the connection will then fail. It is therefore recommended to always
       have the <u>AES-256-GCM</u> and <u>AES-128-GCM</u> ciphers to the <b>--ncp-ciphers</b> options to avoid this behaviour.

   <b>OpenVPN</b> <b>3</b> <b>clients</b>
       Clients  based  on  the  OpenVPN  3.x  library  (<u>https://github.com/openvpn/openvpn3/</u>)  do  not  have   a
       configurable  <b>--ncp-ciphers</b>  or  <b>--data-ciphers</b> option. Newer versions by default disable legacy AES-CBC,
       BF-CBC, and DES-CBC ciphers.  These clients will always announce support for  all  their  supported  AEAD
       ciphers (<u>AES-256-GCM</u>, <u>AES-128-GCM</u> and in newer versions also <u>Chacha20-Poly1305</u>).

       To  support  OpenVPN 3.x based clients at least one of these ciphers needs to be included in the server's
       <b>--data-ciphers</b> option.

   <b>OpenVPN</b> <b>2.3</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> <b>clients</b> <b>(and</b> <b>clients</b> <b>with</b> <b>--ncp-disable)</b>
       When a client without cipher negotiation support connects to a  server  the  cipher  specified  with  the
       <b>--cipher</b>  option  in the client configuration must be included in the <b>--data-ciphers</b> option of the server
       to allow the client to connect. Otherwise the client will be sent the <b>AUTH_FAILED</b> message that  indicates
       no shared cipher.

       If  the  client  is  2.3  or older and has been configured with the <b>--enable-small</b>  <b>./configure</b> argument,
       using <b>data-ciphers-fallback</b> <b>cipher</b> in the server config file with the explicit cipher used by the  client
       is necessary.

   <b>OpenVPN</b> <b>2.4</b> <b>server</b>
       When  a  client  indicates  support for <u>AES-128-GCM</u> and <u>AES-256-GCM</u> (with <b>IV_NCP=2</b>) an OpenVPN 2.4 server
       will send the first cipher of the <b>--ncp-ciphers</b> to the OpenVPN client regardless of what the  cipher  is.
       To  emulate the behaviour of an OpenVPN 2.4 client as close as possible and have compatibility to a setup
       that depends on this quirk, adding  <u>AES-128-GCM</u> and <u>AES-256-GCM</u> to the client's <b>--data-ciphers</b> option  is
       required. OpenVPN 2.5+ will only announce the <b>IV_NCP=2</b> flag if those ciphers are present.

   <b>OpenVPN</b> <b>2.3</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> <b>servers</b> <b>(and</b> <b>servers</b> <b>with</b> <b>--ncp-disable)</b>
       The  cipher  used  by  the  server must be included in <b>--data-ciphers</b> to allow the client connecting to a
       server without cipher negotiation support.  (For compatibility OpenVPN 2.5 will also  accept  the  cipher
       set with <b>--cipher</b>)

       If  the  server  is  2.3  or older and  has been configured with the <b>--enable-small</b> <b>./configure</b> argument,
       adding <b>--data-ciphers-fallback</b> <b>cipher</b> to the client config with the explicit cipher used by the server is
       necessary.

   <b>Blowfish</b> <b>in</b> <b>CBC</b> <b>mode</b> <b>(BF-CBC)</b> <b>deprecation</b>
       The <b>--cipher</b> option defaulted to <u>BF-CBC</u> in OpenVPN 2.4 and older version. The default was  never  changed
       to  ensure  backwards  compatibility.   In OpenVPN 2.5 this behaviour has now been changed so that if the
       <b>--cipher</b> is not explicitly set it does not allow the weak <u>BF-CBC</u> cipher any more and needs to  explicitly
       added as <b>--cipher</b> <b>BFC-CBC</b> or added to <b>--data-ciphers</b>.

       We strongly recommend to switching away from BF-CBC to a more secure cipher as soon as possible instead.

</pre><h4><b>NETWORK</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       OpenVPN  consists  of  two  sides  of  network configuration.  One side is the <u>link</u> between the local and
       remote side, the other side is the <u>virtual</u> <u>network</u> <u>adapter</u> (tun/tap device).

   <b>Link</b> <b>Options</b>
       This link options section covers options related to the connection between the local and the remote host.

       <b>--bind</b> <u>keywords</u>
              Bind to local address  and  port.  This  is  the  default  unless  any  of  <b>--proto</b>  <b>tcp-client</b>  ,
              <b>--http-proxy</b> or <b>--socks-proxy</b> are used.

              If the optional <b>ipv6only</b> keyword is present OpenVPN will bind only to IPv6 (as opposed to IPv6 and
              IPv4) when a IPv6 socket is opened.

       <b>--float</b>
              Allow  remote  peer  to change its IP address and/or port number, such as due to DHCP (this is the
              default if <b>--remote</b> is not used).  <b>--float</b> when specified with <b>--remote</b> allows an OpenVPN  session
              to  initially  connect  to a peer at a known address, however if packets arrive from a new address
              and pass all authentication tests, the new address will take  control  of  the  session.  This  is
              useful  when  you are connecting to a peer which holds a dynamic address such as a dial-in user or
              DHCP client.

              Essentially, <b>--float</b> tells OpenVPN to accept authenticated packets from any address, not only  the
              address which was specified in the <b>--remote</b> option.

       <b>--fragment</b> <u>args</u>
              Valid syntax:

                 fragment max
                 fragment max mtu

              Enable internal datagram fragmentation so that no UDP datagrams are sent which are larger than <b>max</b>
              bytes.

              If  the  <b>mtu</b>  parameter  is  present  the  <b>max</b>  parameter  is  interpreted  to  include IP and UDP
              encapsulation overhead. The <b>mtu</b> parameter is introduced in OpenVPN version 2.6.0.

              If the <b>mtu</b> parameter is absent, the <b>max</b> parameter is interpreted in the same way as the <b>--link-mtu</b>
              parameter, i.e.  the UDP packet size after encapsulation overhead  has  been  added  in,  but  not
              including the UDP header itself.

              The <b>--fragment</b> option only makes sense when you are using the UDP protocol (<b>--proto</b> <b>udp</b>).

              <b>--fragment</b> adds 4 bytes of overhead per datagram.

              See the <b>--mssfix</b> option below for an important related option to <b>--fragment</b>.

              It should also be noted that this option is not meant to replace UDP fragmentation at the IP stack
              level.  It  is only meant as a last resort when path MTU discovery is broken. Using this option is
              less efficient than fixing path MTU discovery for your IP link and using native  IP  fragmentation
              instead.

              Having  said that, there are circumstances where using OpenVPN's internal fragmentation capability
              may be your only option, such as tunneling a UDP multicast stream which requires fragmentation.

       <b>--keepalive</b> <u>args</u>
              A helper directive designed to simplify the expression of <b>--ping</b> and <b>--ping-restart</b>.

              Valid syntax:

                 keepalive interval timeout

              Send ping once every <b>interval</b> seconds, restart if ping is not received for <b>timeout</b> seconds.

              This option can be used on both client and server side, but it is enough to add this on the server
              side as it will push appropriate <b>--ping</b> and <b>--ping-restart</b> options to the client. If used on  both
              server and client, the values pushed from server will override the client local values.

              The  <b>timeout</b>  argument  will  be  twice as long on the server side. This ensures that a timeout is
              detected on client side before the server side drops the connection.

              For example, <b>--keepalive</b> <b>10</b> <b>60</b> expands as follows:

                 if mode server:
                     ping 10                    # Argument: interval
                     ping-restart 120           # Argument: timeout*2
                     push "ping 10"             # Argument: interval
                     push "ping-restart 60"     # Argument: timeout
                 else
                     ping 10                    # Argument: interval
                     ping-restart 60            # Argument: timeout

       <b>--link-mtu</b> <u>n</u>
              <b>DEPRECATED</b> Sets an upper bound on the size of UDP packets which are sent  between  OpenVPN  peers.
              <u>It's</u> <u>best</u> <u>not</u> <u>to</u> <u>set</u> <u>this</u> <u>parameter</u> <u>unless</u> <u>you</u> <u>know</u> <u>what</u> <u>you're</u> <u>doing.</u>

              Due to variable header size of IP header (20 bytes for IPv4 and 40 bytes for IPv6) and dynamically
              negotiated data channel cipher, this option is not reliable. It is recommended to set tun-mtu with
              enough headroom instead.

       <b>--local</b> <u>host</u>
              Local  host  name or IP address for bind. If specified, OpenVPN will bind to this address only. If
              unspecified, OpenVPN will bind to all interfaces.

       <b>--lport</b> <u>port</u>
              Set local TCP/UDP port number or name. Cannot be used together with <b>--nobind</b> option.

       <b>--mark</b> <u>value</u>
              Mark encrypted packets being sent with <b>value</b>. The mark value can be matched in policy routing  and
              packetfilter  rules.  This  option  is only supported in Linux and does nothing on other operating
              systems.

       <b>--mode</b> <u>m</u>
              Set OpenVPN major mode. By default,  OpenVPN  runs  in  point-to-point  mode  (<b>p2p</b>).  OpenVPN  2.0
              introduces a new mode (<b>server</b>) which implements a multi-client server capability.

       <b>--mssfix</b> <u>args</u>
              Valid syntax:

                 mssfix max [mtu]

                 mssfix max [fixed]

                 mssfix

              Announce  to  TCP  sessions running over the tunnel that they should limit their send packet sizes
              such that after OpenVPN has encapsulated them, the resulting UDP packet size that OpenVPN sends to
              its peer will not exceed <b>max</b> bytes. The default value is <b>1492</b> <b>mtu</b>. Use <b>0</b> as max to disable mssfix.

              If the <b>mtu</b> parameter is specified the <b>max</b> value is interpreted as the resulting packet size of VPN
              packets including the IP and UDP header.  Support for the <b>mtu</b> parameter  was  added  with  OpenVPN
              version 2.6.0.

              If  the  <b>mtu</b>  parameter  is not specified, the <b>max</b> parameter is interpreted in the same way as the
              <b>--link-mtu</b> parameter, i.e.  the UDP packet size after encapsulation overhead has  been  added  in,
              but  not  including  the  UDP header itself. Resulting packet would be at most 28 bytes larger for
              IPv4 and 48 bytes for IPv6 (20/40 bytes for IP header and 8 bytes for UDP header).  Default  value
              of  1450  allows  OpenVPN  packets  to  be transmitted over IPv4 on a link with MTU 1478 or higher
              without IP level fragmentation (and 1498 for IPv6).

              If the <b>fixed</b>  parameter  is  specified,  OpenVPN  will  make  no  attempt  to  calculate  the  VPN
              encapsulation overhead but instead will set the MSS to limit the size of the payload IP packets to
              the specified number. IPv4 packets will have the MSS value lowered to mssfix - 40 and IPv6 packets
              to mssfix - 60.

              if  <b>--mssfix</b>  is  specified  is  specified  without  any  parameter  it inherits the parameters of
              <b>--fragment</b> if specified or uses the default for <b>--mssfix</b> otherwise.

              The <b>--mssfix</b> option only makes sense when you are using the UDP protocol for OpenVPN  peer-to-peer
              communication, i.e. <b>--proto</b> <b>udp</b>.

              <b>--mssfix</b>  and  <b>--fragment</b>  can  be ideally used together, where <b>--mssfix</b> will try to keep TCP from
              needing packet fragmentation in the first place, and if big  packets  come  through  anyhow  (from
              protocols other than TCP), <b>--fragment</b> will internally fragment them.

              <b>--max-packet-size</b>,  <b>--fragment</b>,  and  <b>--mssfix</b>  are  designed  to work around cases where Path MTU
              discovery is broken on the network path between OpenVPN peers.

              The usual symptom of such a breakdown is an OpenVPN connection which successfully starts, but then
              stalls during active usage.

              If <b>--fragment</b> and <b>--mssfix</b> are used together, <b>--mssfix</b> will take its default  <b>max</b>  parameter  from
              the <b>--fragment</b> <b>max</b> option.

              Therefore,  one  could  lower  the  maximum  UDP packet size to 1300 (a good first try for solving
              MTU-related connection problems) with the following options:

                 --tun-mtu 1500 --fragment 1300 --mssfix

              If the <b>max-packet-size</b> <b>size</b> option is used in the configuration it will also act as if <b>mssfix</b> <b>size</b>
              <b>mtu</b> was specified in the configuration.

       <b>--mtu-disc</b> <u>type</u>
              Should we do Path MTU discovery on TCP/UDP channel? Only supported on  OSes  such  as  Linux  that
              supports the necessary system call to set.

              Valid types:

              <b>no</b>      Never send DF (Don't Fragment) frames

              <b>maybe</b>   Use per-route hints

              <b>yes</b>     Always DF (Don't Fragment)

       <b>--mtu-test</b>
              To empirically measure MTU on connection startup, add the <b>--mtu-test</b> option to your configuration.
              OpenVPN will send ping packets of various sizes to the remote peer and measure the largest packets
              which  were  successfully  received.  The  <b>--mtu-test</b>  process  normally  takes about 3 minutes to
              complete.

       <b>--nobind</b>
              Do not bind to local address and port. The IP stack will allocate a  dynamic  port  for  returning
              packets.  Since the value of the dynamic port could not be known in advance by a peer, this option
              is only suitable for peers which will be initiating connections by using the <b>--remote</b> option.

       <b>--passtos</b>
              Set the TOS field of the tunnel packet to what the payload's TOS is.

       <b>--ping</b> <u>n</u>
              Ping remote over the TCP/UDP control channel if no packets have been sent for at least  <b>n</b>  seconds
              (specify  <b>--ping</b>  on  both peers to cause ping packets to be sent in both directions since OpenVPN
              ping packets are not echoed like IP ping packets). When used in  one  of  OpenVPN's  secure  modes
              (where   <b>--secret</b>,   <b>--tls-server</b>   or  <b>--tls-client</b>  is  specified),  the  ping  packet  will  be
              cryptographically secure.

              This option has two intended uses:

              1. Compatibility with stateful firewalls. The periodic ping will ensure that a  stateful  firewall
                 rule which allows OpenVPN UDP packets to pass will not time out.

              2. To  provide  a  basis  for  the  remote to test the existence of its peer using the <b>--ping-exit</b>
                 option.

              When using OpenVPN in server mode see also <b>--keepalive</b>.

       <b>--ping-exit</b> <u>n</u>
              Causes OpenVPN to exit after <b>n</b> seconds pass without reception of  a  ping  or  other  packet  from
              remote. This option can be combined with <b>--inactive</b>, <b>--ping</b> and <b>--ping-exit</b> to create a two-tiered
              inactivity disconnect.

              For example,

                 openvpn [options...] --inactive 3600 --ping 10 --ping-exit 60

              when  used on both peers will cause OpenVPN to exit within 60 seconds if its peer disconnects, but
              will exit after one hour if no actual tunnel data is exchanged.

       <b>--ping-restart</b> <u>n</u>
              Similar to <b>--ping-exit</b>, but trigger a <b>SIGUSR1</b> restart after <b>n</b> seconds pass without reception of  a
              ping or other packet from remote.

              This  option  is  useful in cases where the remote peer has a dynamic IP address and a low-TTL DNS
              name is used to track the IP address using  a  service  such  as  <u>https://www.nsupdate.info/</u>  +  a
              dynamic DNS client such as <b>ddclient</b>.

              If  the  peer  cannot  be  reached,  a  restart  will be triggered, causing the hostname used with
              <b>--remote</b> to be re-resolved (if <b>--resolv-retry</b> is also specified).

              In server mode, <b>--ping-restart</b>, <b>--inactive</b> or any other type of internally generated  signal  will
              always  be  applied to individual client instance objects, never to whole server itself. Note also
              in server mode that any internally generated signal which would normally  cause  a  restart,  will
              cause the deletion of the client instance object instead.

              In  client  mode, the <b>--ping-restart</b> parameter is set to 120 seconds by default. This default will
              hold until the client pulls a replacement value from the server, based on the <b>--keepalive</b>  setting
              in  the  server  configuration.  To  disable  the  120 second default, set <b>--ping-restart</b> <b>0</b> on the
              client.

              See the signals section below for more information on <b>SIGUSR1</b>.

              Note  that  the  behavior  of  <b>SIGUSR1</b>  can  be  modified  by  the  <b>--persist-tun</b>,  <b>--persist-key</b>,
              <b>--persist-local-ip</b> and <b>--persist-remote-ip</b> options.

              Also note that <b>--ping-exit</b> and <b>--ping-restart</b> are mutually exclusive and cannot be used together.

       <b>--ping-timer-rem</b>
              Run  the  <b>--ping-exit</b>  / <b>--ping-restart</b> timer only if we have a remote address. Use this option if
              you are starting the daemon in listen mode (i.e. without an explicit <b>--remote</b> peer), and you don't
              want to start clocking timeouts until a remote peer connects.

       <b>--proto</b> <u>p</u>
              Use protocol <b>p</b> for communicating with remote host. <b>p</b> can be <b>udp</b>, <b>tcp-client</b>,  or  <b>tcp-server</b>.  You
              can  also  limit  OpenVPN  to  use  only  IPv4  or only IPv6 by specifying <b>p</b> as <b>udp4</b>, <b>tcp4-client</b>,
              <b>tcp4-server</b> or <b>udp6</b>, <b>tcp6-client</b>, <b>tcp6-server</b>, respectively.

              The default protocol is <b>udp</b> when <b>--proto</b> is not specified.

              For UDP operation, <b>--proto</b> <b>udp</b> should be specified on both peers.

              For TCP operation, one peer must use <b>--proto</b> <b>tcp-server</b> and the other must use <b>--proto</b> <b>tcp-client</b>.
              A peer started with <b>tcp-server</b> will wait indefinitely for an incoming connection. A  peer  started
              with  <b>tcp-client</b>  will attempt to connect, and if that fails, will sleep for 5 seconds (adjustable
              via the <b>--connect-retry</b> option) and try again infinite or up to  N  retries  (adjustable  via  the
              <b>--connect-retry-max</b>  option). Both TCP client and server will simulate a SIGUSR1 restart signal if
              either side resets the connection.

              OpenVPN is designed to operate optimally over UDP, but TCP capability is provided  for  situations
              where  UDP cannot be used. In comparison with UDP, TCP will usually be somewhat less efficient and
              less robust when used over unreliable or congested networks.

              This    article    outlines    some    of    problems    with    tunneling    IP     over     TCP:
              <u><a href="http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html">http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html</a></u>

              There  are  certain  cases,  however,  where  using  TCP  may  be advantageous from a security and
              robustness perspective, such as tunneling non-IP or application-level UDP protocols, or  tunneling
              protocols which don't possess a built-in reliability layer.

       <b>--port</b> <u>port</u>
              TCP/UDP  port number or port name for both local and remote (sets both <b>--lport</b> and <b>--rport</b> options
              to given port). The current default of 1194 represents the official IANA  port  number  assignment
              for  OpenVPN  and  has been used since version 2.0-beta17. Previous versions used port 5000 as the
              default.

       <b>--rport</b> <u>port</u>
              Set TCP/UDP port number or name used by the <b>--remote</b> option. The port can  also  be  set  directly
              using the <b>--remote</b> option.

       <b>--replay-window</b> <u>args</u>
              Modify the replay protection sliding-window size and time window.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 replay-window n
                 replay-window n t

              Use a replay protection sliding-window of size <b>n</b> and a time window of <b>t</b> seconds.

              By default <b>n</b> is <b>64</b> (the IPSec default) and <b>t</b> is <b>15</b> seconds.

              This option is only relevant in UDP mode, i.e. when either <b>--proto</b> <b>udp</b> is specified, or no <b>--proto</b>
              option is specified.

              When  OpenVPN  tunnels IP packets over UDP, there is the possibility that packets might be dropped
              or delivered out of order. Because OpenVPN, like IPSec, is emulating the physical  network  layer,
              it  will  accept  an out-of-order packet sequence, and will deliver such packets in the same order
              they were received to the TCP/IP protocol stack, provided they satisfy several constraints.

              a. The packet cannot  be  a  replay  (unless  <b>--no-replay</b>  is  specified,  which  disables  replay
                 protection altogether).

              b. If  a  packet  arrives  out  of  order,  it will only be accepted if the difference between its
                 sequence number and the highest sequence number received so far is less than <b>n</b>.

              c. If a packet arrives out of order, it will only be accepted  if  it  arrives  no  later  than  <b>t</b>
                 seconds after any packet containing a higher sequence number.

              If  you  are using a network link with a large pipeline (meaning that the product of bandwidth and
              latency is high), you may want to use a larger value for <b>n</b>. Satellite links  in  particular  often
              require this.

              If you run OpenVPN at <b>--verb</b> <b>4</b>, you will see the message "PID_ERR replay-window backtrack occurred
              [x]" every time the maximum sequence number backtrack seen thus far increases. This can be used to
              calibrate <b>n</b>.

              There  is some controversy on the appropriate method of handling packet reordering at the security
              layer.

              Namely, to what extent should the security layer protect the encapsulated  protocol  from  attacks
              which masquerade as the kinds of normal packet loss and reordering that occur over IP networks?

              The  IPSec  and  OpenVPN  approach  is  to allow packet reordering within a certain fixed sequence
              number window.

              OpenVPN adds to the IPSec model by limiting the window size in time as well as sequence space.

              OpenVPN also adds TCP transport as an option (not offered by IPSec)  in  which  case  OpenVPN  can
              adopt  a  very  strict attitude towards message deletion and reordering: Don't allow it. Since TCP
              guarantees reliability, any packet loss or reordering event can be assumed to be an attack.

              In this sense, it could be argued that TCP tunnel transport is preferred when tunneling non-IP  or
              UDP  application  protocols  which  might be vulnerable to a message deletion or reordering attack
              which falls within the normal operational parameters of IP networks.

              So I would make the statement that one should never tunnel a non-IP protocol  or  UDP  application
              protocol  over UDP, if the protocol might be vulnerable to a message deletion or reordering attack
              that falls within the normal operating parameters of what is to be expected from the  physical  IP
              layer. The problem is easily fixed by simply using TCP as the VPN transport layer.

       <b>--replay-persist</b> <u>file</u>
              Persist replay-protection state across sessions using <b>file</b> to save and reload the state.

              This  option  will  keep  a disk copy of the current replay protection state (i.e. the most recent
              packet timestamp and sequence number received from the remote peer), so that if an OpenVPN session
              is stopped and restarted, it will reject any replays of packets which were already received by the
              prior session.

              This option only makes sense when replay protection is enabled (the default)  and  you  are  using
              either <b>--secret</b> (shared-secret key mode) or TLS mode with <b>--tls-auth</b>.

       <b>--session-timeout</b> <u>n</u>
              Raises <b>SIGTERM</b> for the client instance after <b>n</b> seconds since the beginning of the session, forcing
              OpenVPN to disconnect.  In client mode, OpenVPN will disconnect and exit, while in server mode all
              client sessions are terminated.

              This  option  can  also be specified in a client instance config file using <b>--client-config-dir</b> or
              dynamically generated using a <b>--client-connect</b> script. In these cases,  only  the  related  client
              session is terminated.

       <b>--socket-flags</b> <u>flags</u>
              Apply the given flags to the OpenVPN transport socket. Currently, only <b>TCP_NODELAY</b> is supported.

              The  <b>TCP_NODELAY</b>  socket  flag is useful in TCP mode, and causes the kernel to send tunnel packets
              immediately over the TCP connection without trying to group several smaller packets into a  larger
              packet.  This can result in a considerably improvement in latency.

              This  option  is  pushable from server to client, and should be used on both client and server for
              maximum effect.

       <b>--tcp-nodelay</b>
              This macro sets the <b>TCP_NODELAY</b> socket flag on the server as  well  as  pushes  it  to  connecting
              clients.  The  <b>TCP_NODELAY</b>  flag disables the Nagle algorithm on TCP sockets causing packets to be
              transmitted immediately with low latency, rather than waiting a short period of time in  order  to
              aggregate  several  packets  into  a  larger  containing  packet.   In  VPN applications over TCP,
              <b>TCP_NODELAY</b> is generally a good latency optimization.

              The macro expands as follows:

                 if mode server:
                     socket-flags TCP_NODELAY
                     push "socket-flags TCP_NODELAY"

       <b>--max-packet-size</b> <u>size</u>
              This option will instruct OpenVPN to try to limit the maximum on-write packet size by  restricting
              the control channel packet size and setting <b>--mssfix</b>.

              OpenVPN  will try to keep its control channel messages below this size but due to some constraints
              in the protocol this is not always possible. If the option is not set, the control packet  maximum
              size  defaults  to 1250.  The control channel packet size will be restricted to values between 154
              and 2048. The maximum packet size includes encapsulation overhead like UDP and IP.

              In terms of <b>--mssfix</b> it will expand to:

                 mssfix size mtu

              If  you  need  to  set  <b>--mssfix</b>  for  data  channel  and  control  channel  maximum  packet  size
              independently, use <b>--max-packet-size</b> first, followed by a <b>--mssfix</b> in the configuration.

              In  general  the  default  size  of 1250 should work almost universally apart from specific corner
              cases, especially since IPv6 requires a MTU of 1280 or larger.

   <b>Virtual</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Adapter</b> <b>(VPN</b> <b>interface)</b>
       Options in this section relates to configuration of the  virtual  tun/tap  network  interface,  including
       setting the VPN IP address and network routing.

       <b>--bind-dev</b> <u>device</u>
              (Linux only) Set <b>device</b> to bind the server socket to a <u>Virtual</u> <u>Routing</u> <u>and</u> <u>Forwarding</u> device

       <b>--block-ipv6</b>
              On  the client, instead of sending IPv6 packets over the VPN tunnel, all IPv6 packets are answered
              with an ICMPv6 no route host message. On the server, all IPv6 packets from  clients  are  answered
              with  an  ICMPv6  no route to host message. This options is intended for cases when IPv6 should be
              blocked and other options are not available. <b>--block-ipv6</b> will  use  the  remote  IPv6  as  source
              address of the ICMPv6 packets if set, otherwise will use <b>fe80::7</b> as source address.

              For  this  option  to  make  sense  you  actually  have to route traffic to the tun interface. The
              following example config block would send all IPv6 traffic to OpenVPN and answer all requests with
              no route to host, effectively blocking IPv6 (to avoid IPv6 connections from  dual-stacked  clients
              leaking around IPv4-only VPN services).

              <b>Client</b> <b>config</b>

                        --ifconfig-ipv6 fd15:53b6:dead::2/64 fd15:53b6:dead::1
                        --redirect-gateway ipv6
                        --block-ipv6

              <b>Server</b> <b>config</b>
                     Push a "valid" ipv6 config to the client and block on the server

                        --push "ifconfig-ipv6 fd15:53b6:dead::2/64 fd15:53b6:dead::1"
                        --push "redirect-gateway ipv6"
                        --block-ipv6

              Note:  this  option does not influence traffic sent from the server towards the client (neither on
              the server nor on the client side).  This is not seen as necessary, as such traffic  can  be  most
              easily  avoided  by  not  configuring IPv6 on the server tun, or setting up a server-side firewall
              rule.

       <b>--dev</b> <u>device</u>
              TUN/TAP virtual network device which can be <b>tunX</b>, <b>tapX</b>, <b>null</b> or an arbitrary name string (<b>X</b> can be
              omitted for a dynamic device.)

              See examples section below for an example on setting up a TUN device.

              You must use either tun devices on both ends of the connection or tap devices on  both  ends.  You
              cannot mix them, as they represent different underlying network layers:

              <b>tun</b>    devices encapsulate IPv4 or IPv6 (OSI Layer 3)

              <b>tap</b>    devices encapsulate Ethernet 802.3 (OSI Layer 2).

              Valid syntaxes:

                 dev tun2
                 dev tap4
                 dev ovpn

              What happens if the device name is not <b>tun</b> or <b>tap</b> is platform dependent.

              On  most  platforms,  <b>tunN</b>  (e.g. tun2, tun30) and <b>tapN</b> (e.g. tap3) will create a numbered tun/tap
              interface with the number specified - this is useful if multiple OpenVPN instances are active, and
              the instance-to-device mapping needs to be known.  Some platforms do not support  "numbered  tap",
              so trying <b>--dev</b> <b>tap3</b> will fail.

              Arbitrary device names (e.g. <b>--dev</b> <b>tun-home</b>) will only work on FreeBSD (with the DCO kernel driver
              for <b>tun</b> devices) and Linux (for both <b>tun</b> and <b>tap</b> devices, DCO and tun/tap driver).

              If such a device name starts with <b>tun</b> or <b>tap</b> (e.g. <b>tun-home</b>), OpenVPN will choose the right device
              type  automatically.   Otherwise the desired device type needs to be specified with <b>--dev-type</b> <b>tun</b>
              or <b>--dev-type</b> <b>tap</b>.

              On Windows, only the names <b>tun</b> and <b>tap</b> are supported.  Selection among multiple installed  drivers
              or driver instances is done with <b>--dev-node</b> and <b>--windows-driver</b>.

       <b>--dev-node</b> <u>node</u>
              This is a highly system dependent option to influence tun/tap driver selection.

              On  Linux,  tun/tap  devices  are  created  by accessing <b>/dev/net/tun</b>, and this device name can be
              changed using <b>--dev-node</b> <b>...</b>.

              Under Mac OS X this option can be used to specify the default tun implementation. Using <b>--dev-node</b>
              <b>utun</b> forces usage of the native Darwin tun kernel  support.  Use  <b>--dev-node</b>  <b>utunN</b>  to  select  a
              specific  utun  instance.  To  force  using  the <b>tun.kext</b> (<b>/dev/tunX</b>) use <b>--dev-node</b> <b>tun</b>. When not
              specifying a <b>--dev-node</b> option openvpn will first try to open utun, and fall back to tun.kext.

              On Windows systems, select the TAP-Win32 adapter which is named <b>node</b> in  the  Network  Connections
              Control  Panel or the raw GUID of the adapter enclosed by braces. The <b>--show-adapters</b> option under
              Windows can also be used to enumerate all available TAP-Win32 adapters  and  will  show  both  the
              network connections control panel name and the GUID for each TAP-Win32 adapter.

              On  other  platforms,  <b>--dev-node</b> <b>node</b> will influence the naming of the created tun/tap device, if
              supported on that platform.  If OpenVPN cannot figure out whether <b>node</b> is  a  TUN  or  TAP  device
              based on the name, you should also specify <b>--dev-type</b> <b>tun</b> or <b>--dev-type</b> <b>tap</b>.

       <b>--dev-type</b> <u>device-type</u>
              Which  device type are we using? <b>device-type</b> should be <b>tun</b> (OSI Layer 3) or <b>tap</b> (OSI Layer 2). Use
              this option only if the TUN/TAP device used with <b>--dev</b> does not begin with <b>tun</b> or <b>tap</b>.

       <b>--dhcp-option</b> <u>args</u>
              Set additional network parameters on supported platforms. May be specified on the client or pushed
              from the server. On Windows these options are handled by the <b>tap-windows6</b>  driver  by  default  or
              directly  by  OpenVPN  if dhcp is disabled or the <b>wintun</b> driver is in use. The <b>OpenVPN</b> <b>for</b> <b>Android</b>
              client also handles them internally.

              On all other platforms these options are only saved in the client's  environment  under  the  name
              <b>foreign_option_{n}</b>  before  the  <b>--up</b> script is called. A plugin or an <b>--up</b> script must be used to
              pick up and interpret these as required. Many Linux distributions include such  scripts  and  some
              third-party user interfaces such as tunnelblick also come with scripts that process these options.

              Valid syntax:

                 dhcp-option type [parm]

              <b>DOMAIN</b> <b>name</b>
                     Set Connection-specific DNS Suffix to <b>name</b>.

              <b>ADAPTER_DOMAIN_SUFFIX</b> <b>name</b>
                     Alias to <b>DOMAIN</b>. This is a compatibility option, it should not be used in new deployments.

              <b>DOMAIN-SEARCH</b> <b>name</b>
                     Add  <b>name</b>  to  the  domain  search  list.  Repeat this option to add more entries. Up to 10
                     domains are supported.

              <b>DNS</b> <b>address</b>
                     Set primary domain name server IPv4 or IPv6 address.  Repeat this option to  set  secondary
                     DNS server addresses.

                     Note:  DNS  IPv6  servers are currently set using netsh (the existing DHCP code can only do
                     IPv4 DHCP, and that protocol only permits IPv4 addresses anywhere). The option will be  put
                     into the environment, so an <b>--up</b> script could act upon it if needed.

              <b>WINS</b> <b>address</b>
                     Set  primary  WINS server address (NetBIOS over TCP/IP Name Server).  Repeat this option to
                     set secondary WINS server addresses.

              <b>NBDD</b> <b>address</b>
                     Set primary NBDD server address (NetBIOS over TCP/IP Datagram Distribution Server).  Repeat
                     this option to set secondary NBDD server addresses.

              <b>NTP</b> <b>address</b>
                     Set  primary  NTP  server  address  (Network  Time  Protocol).   Repeat  this option to set
                     secondary NTP server addresses.

              <b>NBT</b> <b>type</b>
                     Set NetBIOS over TCP/IP Node type. Possible options:

                     <b>1</b>      b-node (broadcasts)

                     <b>2</b>      p-node (point-to-point name queries to a WINS server)

                     <b>4</b>      m-node (broadcast then query name server)

                     <b>8</b>      h-node (query name server, then broadcast).

              <b>NBS</b> <b>scope-id</b>
                     Set NetBIOS over TCP/IP Scope. A NetBIOS Scope ID provides an extended naming  service  for
                     the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (Known as NBT) module. The primary purpose of a NetBIOS scope ID is
                     to  isolate  NetBIOS  traffic on a single network to only those nodes with the same NetBIOS
                     scope ID. The NetBIOS scope ID is a character string that is appended to the NetBIOS  name.
                     The  NetBIOS  scope  ID  on  two  hosts  must  match,  or the two hosts will not be able to
                     communicate.  The NetBIOS Scope ID also allows computers to use the same computer name,  as
                     they  have different scope IDs. The Scope ID becomes a part of the NetBIOS name, making the
                     name unique. (This description of NetBIOS scopes courtesy of <u><a href="mailto:NeonSurge@abyss.com">NeonSurge@abyss.com</a></u>)

              <b>DISABLE-NBT</b>
                     Disable Netbios-over-TCP/IP.

              <b>code</b>   <u>PROXY_HTTP</u> <b>host</b> <b>port</b> Sets a HTTP proxy that should be used when connected to the VPN.

                     This option currently only works on OpenVPN for Android and requires Android 10 or later.

       <b>--ifconfig</b> <u>args</u>
              Set TUN/TAP adapter parameters. It requires the <u>IP</u> <u>address</u> of the  local  VPN  endpoint.  For  TUN
              devices  in  point-to-point  mode,  the next argument must be the VPN IP address of the remote VPN
              endpoint. For TAP devices, or TUN devices used with <b>--topology</b> <b>subnet</b>, the second argument is  the
              subnet mask of the virtual network segment which is being created or connected to.

              For  TUN  devices, which facilitate virtual point-to-point IP connections (when used in <b>--topology</b>
              <b>net30</b> or <b>p2p</b> mode), the proper usage of <b>--ifconfig</b> is to use two private IP  addresses  which  are
              not  a  member  of  any  existing  subnet which is in use. The IP addresses may be consecutive and
              should have their order reversed on the remote peer.  After the VPN is established, by pinging <b>rn</b>,
              you will be pinging across the VPN.

              For TAP devices, which provide the ability to create virtual ethernet segments, or TUN devices  in
              <b>--topology</b>  <b>subnet</b> mode (which create virtual "multipoint networks"), <b>--ifconfig</b> is used to set an
              IP address and subnet mask just as a physical ethernet adapter would be similarly  configured.  If
              you are attempting to connect to a remote ethernet bridge, the IP address and subnet should be set
              to  values  which  would be valid on the bridged ethernet segment (note also that DHCP can be used
              for the same purpose).

              This option, while primarily a proxy for the <b><a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a></b>(8) command, is designed to simplify  TUN/TAP
              tunnel  configuration  by providing a standard interface to the different ifconfig implementations
              on different platforms.

              <b>--ifconfig</b> parameters which are IP addresses can also be specified as a  DNS  or  <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>  file
              resolvable name.

              For  TAP devices, <b>--ifconfig</b> should not be used if the TAP interface will be getting an IP address
              lease from a DHCP server.

              Examples:

                 # tun device in net30/p2p mode
                 ifconfig 10.8.0.2 10.8.0.1

                 # tun/tap device in subnet mode
                 ifconfig 10.8.0.2 255.255.255.0

       <b>--ifconfig-ipv6</b> <u>args</u>
              Configure an IPv6 address on the <u>tun</u> device.

              Valid syntax:

                 ifconfig-ipv6 ipv6addr/bits [ipv6remote]

              The <b>ipv6addr/bits</b> argument is the IPv6 address to use. The  second  parameter  is  used  as  route
              target for <b>--route-ipv6</b> if no gateway is specified.

              The <b>--topology</b> option has no influence with <b>--ifconfig-ipv6</b>

       <b>--ifconfig-noexec</b>
              Don't  actually  execute  ifconfig/netsh  commands,  instead pass <b>--ifconfig</b> parameters to scripts
              using environmental variables.

       <b>--ifconfig-nowarn</b>
              Don't output an options consistency check warning if the <b>--ifconfig</b> option on  this  side  of  the
              connection  doesn't  match  the  remote  side.  This is useful when you want to retain the overall
              benefits of the options consistency check (also see <b>--disable-occ</b> option) while only disabling the
              ifconfig component of the check.

              For example, if you have a configuration where the local host uses <b>--ifconfig</b> but the remote  host
              does not, use <b>--ifconfig-nowarn</b> on the local host.

              This  option will also silence warnings about potential address conflicts which occasionally annoy
              more experienced users by triggering "false positive" warnings.

       <b>--lladdr</b> <u>address</u>
              Specify the link layer address, more commonly known as the  MAC  address.   Only  applied  to  TAP
              devices.

       <b>--persist-tun</b>
              Don't  close  and  reopen  TUN/TAP  device or run up/down scripts across <b>SIGUSR1</b> or <b>--ping-restart</b>
              restarts.

              <b>SIGUSR1</b> is a restart signal similar to <b>SIGHUP</b>, but which offers finer-grained control  over  reset
              options.

       <b>--redirect-gateway</b> <u>flags</u>
              Automatically  execute routing commands to cause all outgoing IP traffic to be redirected over the
              VPN. This is a client-side option.

              This option performs three steps:

              1. Create a static route for the <b>--remote</b> address  which  forwards  to  the  pre-existing  default
                 gateway. This is done so that <b>(3)</b> will not create a routing loop.

              2. Delete the default gateway route.

              3. Set the new default gateway to be the VPN endpoint address (derived either from <b>--route-gateway</b>
                 or the second parameter to <b>--ifconfig</b> when <b>--dev</b> <b>tun</b> is specified).

              When  the  tunnel  is  torn down, all of the above steps are reversed so that the original default
              route is restored.

              Option flags:

              <b>local</b>  Add the <b>local</b> flag if both OpenVPN peers are directly connected via a common  subnet,  such
                     as with wireless. The <b>local</b> flag will cause step <b>(1)</b> above to be omitted.

              <b>autolocal</b>
                     Try to automatically determine whether to enable <b>local</b> flag above.

              <b>def1</b>   Use  this  flag  to  override the default gateway by using <b>0.0.0.0/1</b> and <b>128.0.0.0/1</b> rather
                     than <b>0.0.0.0/0</b>. This has the benefit of overriding but not wiping out the original  default
                     gateway.

              <b>bypass-dhcp</b>
                     Add  a  direct  route  to  the  DHCP  server (if it is non-local) which bypasses the tunnel
                     (Available on Windows clients, may not be available on non-Windows clients).

              <b>bypass-dns</b>
                     Add a direct route to the DNS server(s) (if they are non-local) which bypasses  the  tunnel
                     (Available on Windows clients, may not be available on non-Windows clients).

              <b>block-local</b>
                     Block  access  to  local  LAN when the tunnel is active, except for the LAN gateway itself.
                     This is accomplished by routing the local LAN (except for the LAN gateway address) into the
                     tunnel.

              <b>ipv6</b>   Redirect IPv6 routing into the tunnel. This works similar to the <b>def1</b> flag, that  is,  more
                     specific IPv6 routes are added (<b>2000::/4</b>, <b>3000::/4</b>), covering the whole IPv6 unicast space.

              <b>!ipv4</b>  Do  not  redirect  IPv4  traffic  -  typically used in the flag pair <b>ipv6</b> <b>!ipv4</b> to redirect
                     IPv6-only.

       <b>--redirect-private</b> <u>flags</u>
              Like <b>--redirect-gateway</b>, but omit actually changing the  default  gateway.   Useful  when  pushing
              private subnets.

       <b>--route</b> <u>args</u>
              Add  route  to  routing  table  after connection is established. Multiple routes can be specified.
              Routes will be automatically torn down in reverse order prior to TUN/TAP device close.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 route network/IP
                 route network/IP netmask
                 route network/IP netmask gateway
                 route network/IP netmask gateway metric

              This option is intended as a convenience proxy for the <b><a href="../man8/route.8.html">route</a></b>(8) shell command, while at  the  same
              time providing portable semantics across OpenVPN's platform space.

              <b>netmask</b>
                     defaults to <b>255.255.255.255</b> when not given

              <b>gateway</b>
                     default  taken from <b>--route-gateway</b> or the second parameter to <b>--ifconfig</b> when <b>--dev</b> <b>tun</b> is
                     specified.

              <b>metric</b> default taken from <b>--route-metric</b> if set, otherwise <b>0</b>.

              The default can be specified by leaving an option blank or setting it to <b>default</b>.

              The <b>network</b> and <b>gateway</b> parameters can also be specified as a DNS or  <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b>  file  resolvable
              name, or as one of three special keywords:

              <b>vpn_gateway</b>
                     The  remote  VPN  endpoint  address  (derived  either  from  <b>--route-gateway</b>  or the second
                     parameter to <b>--ifconfig</b> when <b>--dev</b> <b>tun</b> is specified).

              <b>net_gateway</b>
                     The pre-existing IP default gateway, read from the routing  table  (not  supported  on  all
                     OSes).

              <b>remote_host</b>
                     The  <b>--remote</b>  address  if  OpenVPN is being run in client mode, and is undefined in server
                     mode.

       <b>--route-delay</b> <u>args</u>
              Valid syntaxes:

                 route-delay
                 route-delay n
                 route-delay n w

              Delay <b>n</b> seconds (default <b>0</b>) after connection establishment, before  adding  routes.  If  <b>n</b>  is  <b>0</b>,
              routes  will  be  added  immediately  upon  connection establishment. If <b>--route-delay</b> is omitted,
              routes will be added immediately after TUN/TAP device open and <b>--up</b> script execution,  before  any
              <b>--user</b> or <b>--group</b> privilege downgrade (or <b>--chroot</b> execution.)

              This option is designed to be useful in scenarios where DHCP is used to set tap adapter addresses.
              The delay will give the DHCP handshake time to complete before routes are added.

              On  Windows,  <b>--route-delay</b> tries to be more intelligent by waiting <b>w</b> seconds (default <b>30</b>) for the
              TAP-Win32 adapter to come up before adding routes.

       <b>--route-ipv6</b> <u>args</u>
              Setup IPv6 routing in the system to send the specified IPv6 network into OpenVPN's <u>tun</u>.

              Valid syntax:

                 route-ipv6 ipv6addr/bits [gateway] [metric]

              The gateway parameter is only used for IPv6  routes  across  <u>tap</u>  devices,  and  if  missing,  the
              <b>ipv6remote</b> field from <b>--ifconfig-ipv6</b> or <b>--route-ipv6-gateway</b> is used.

       <b>--route-gateway</b> <u>arg</u>
              Specify a default <u>gateway</u> for use with <b>--route</b>.

              If  <b>dhcp</b>  is  specified  as  the  parameter,  the  gateway  address  will be extracted from a DHCP
              negotiation with the OpenVPN server-side LAN.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 route-gateway gateway
                 route-gateway dhcp

       <b>--route-ipv6-gateway</b> <u>gw</u>
              Specify a default gateway <b>gw</b> for use with <b>--route-ipv6</b>.

       <b>--route-metric</b> <u>m</u>
              Specify a default metric <b>m</b> for use with <b>--route</b>.

       <b>--route-noexec</b>
              Don't add or  remove  routes  automatically.  Instead  pass  routes  to  <b>--route-up</b>  script  using
              environmental variables.

       <b>--route-nopull</b>
              When  used  with  <b>--client</b>  or  <b>--pull</b>,  accept  options  pushed  by  server  EXCEPT  for  routes,
              block-outside-dns and dhcp options like DNS servers.

              When used on the client, this option effectively  bars  the  server  from  adding  routes  to  the
              client's  routing  table,  however note that this option still allows the server to set the TCP/IP
              properties of the client's TUN/TAP interface.

       <b>--topology</b> <u>mode</u>
              Configure virtual addressing topology when running in  <b>--dev</b>  <b>tun</b>  mode.  This  directive  has  no
              meaning in <b>--dev</b> <b>tap</b> mode, which always uses a <b>subnet</b> topology.

              If  you  set  this  directive  on  the  server,  the  <b>--server</b> and <b>--server-bridge</b> directives will
              automatically push your chosen topology setting to clients as well. This  directive  can  also  be
              manually  pushed  to  clients.  Like the <b>--dev</b> directive, this directive must always be compatible
              between client and server.

              <b>mode</b> can be one of:

              <b>net30</b>  Use a point-to-point topology, by allocating one /30 subnet per client. This is designed to
                     allow point-to-point semantics when some or all of the connecting clients might be  Windows
                     systems. This is the default.

              <b>p2p</b>    Use  a  point-to-point  topology  where  the  remote endpoint of the client's tun interface
                     always points to the local endpoint of the server's tun interface. This  mode  allocates  a
                     single  IP  address per connecting client. Only use when none of the connecting clients are
                     Windows systems.

              <b>subnet</b> Use a subnet rather than a point-to-point topology by configuring the tun interface with  a
                     local  IP  address  and subnet mask, similar to the topology used in <b>--dev</b> <b>tap</b> and ethernet
                     bridging mode. This mode allocates a single IP address per connecting client and  works  on
                     Windows as well.

              <u>Note:</u>  Using  <b>--topology</b>  <b>subnet</b> changes the interpretation of the arguments of <b>--ifconfig</b> to mean
              "address netmask", no longer "local remote".

       <b>--tun-mtu</b> <u>args</u>
              Valid syntaxes:

                 tun-mtu tun-mtu
                 tun-mtu tun-mtu occ-mtu

              Take the TUN device MTU to be <b>tun-mtu</b> and derive the link MTU from it.  In most  cases,  you  will
              probably want to leave this parameter set to its default value.

              The default for <b>tun-mtu</b> is 1500.

              The  OCC  MTU  can  be used to avoid warnings about mismatched MTU from clients. If <b>occ-mtu</b> is not
              specified, it will to default to the tun-mtu.

              The MTU (Maximum Transmission Units) is the maximum datagram  size  in  bytes  that  can  be  sent
              unfragmented  over  a  particular  network path.  OpenVPN requires that packets on the control and
              data channels be sent unfragmented.

              MTU problems often manifest themselves as connections which hang during periods of active usage.

              It's best to use the <b>--fragment</b> and/or <b>--mssfix</b> options to deal with MTU sizing issues.

              Note: Depending on the platform, the operating system allows one to receive  packets  larger  than
              <b>tun-mtu</b>  (e.g.  Linux  and FreeBSD) but other platforms (like macOS) limit received packets to the
              same size as the MTU.

       <b>--tun-max-mtu</b> <u>maxmtu</u>
              This configures the maximum MTU size that a server can push to <b>maxmtu</b>, by configuring the internal
              buffers to allow at least this packet size.  The default  for  <b>maxmtu</b>  is  1600.  Currently,  only
              increasing beyond 1600 is possible, and attempting to reduce max-mtu below 1600 will be ignored.

       <b>--tun-mtu-extra</b> <u>n</u>
              Assume  that  the  TUN/TAP  device might return as many as <b>n</b> bytes more than the <b>--tun-mtu</b> size on
              read. This parameter defaults to 0, which is sufficient for most  TUN  devices.  TAP  devices  may
              introduce  additional  overhead in excess of the MTU size, and a setting of 32 is the default when
              TAP devices are used. This parameter only controls internal OpenVPN buffer sizing, so there is  no
              transmission overhead associated with using a larger value.

   <b>TUN/TAP</b> <b>standalone</b> <b>operations</b>
       These two standalone operations will require <b>--dev</b> and optionally <b>--user</b> and/or <b>--group</b>.

       <b>--mktun</b>
              (Standalone)  Create  a  persistent tunnel on platforms which support them such as Linux. Normally
              TUN/TAP tunnels exist only for the period of time that an application has them open.  This  option
              takes  advantage  of  the  TUN/TAP  driver's ability to build persistent tunnels that live through
              multiple instantiations of OpenVPN and die only when they are deleted or the machine is rebooted.

              One of the advantages of persistent tunnels is that they eliminate the need for separate <b>--up</b>  and
              <b>--down</b>  scripts  to  run  the appropriate <b><a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a></b>(8) and <b><a href="../man8/route.8.html">route</a></b>(8) commands. These commands can be
              placed in the same shell script which starts or terminates an OpenVPN session.

              Another advantage is that open connections through the TUN/TAP-based tunnel will not be  reset  if
              the  OpenVPN  peer  restarts. This can be useful to provide uninterrupted connectivity through the
              tunnel in the event of a DHCP reset of the peer's public IP address  (see  the  <b>--ipchange</b>  option
              above).

              One  disadvantage  of persistent tunnels is that it is harder to automatically configure their MTU
              value (see <b>--link-mtu</b> and <b>--tun-mtu</b> above).

              On some platforms such as Windows, TAP-Win32 tunnels are persistent by default.

       <b>--rmtun</b>
              (Standalone) Remove a persistent tunnel.

   <b>Virtual</b> <b>Routing</b> <b>and</b> <b>Forwarding</b>
       Options in this section relates to configuration of virtual routing and forwarding  in  combination  with
       the underlying operating system.

       As of today this is only supported on Linux, a kernel &gt;= 4.9 is recommended.

       This  could come in handy when for example the external network should be only used as a means to connect
       to some VPN endpoints and all regular traffic should only be routed through any tunnel(s).  This could be
       achieved by setting up a VRF and configuring the interface connected to the external network to  be  part
       of the VRF. The examples below will cover this setup.

       Another option would be to put the tun/tap interface into a VRF. This could be done by an up-script which
       uses the <b>ip</b> <b>link</b> <b>set</b> command shown below.

   <b>VRF</b> <b>setup</b> <b>with</b> <b>iproute2</b>
       Create VRF <b>vrf_external</b> and map it to routing table <b>1023</b>

          ip link add vrf_external type vrf table 1023

       Move <b>eth0</b> into <b>vrf_external</b>

          ip link set master vrf_external dev eth0

       Any prefixes configured on <b>eth0</b> will be moved from the :code`main` routing table into routing table <u>1023</u>

   <b>VRF</b> <b>setup</b> <b>with</b> <b>ifupdown</b>
       For  Debian  based  Distributions <b>ifupdown2</b> provides an almost drop-in replacement for <b>ifupdown</b> including
       VRFs and other features.  A configuration for an interface <b>eth0</b> being part of VRF code:<u>vrf_external</u> could
       look like this:

          auto eth0
          iface eth0
              address 192.0.2.42/24
              address 2001:db8:08:15::42/64
              gateway 192.0.2.1
              gateway 2001:db8:08:15::1
              vrf vrf_external

          auto vrf_external
          iface vrf_external
              vrf-table 1023

   <b>OpenVPN</b> <b>configuration</b>
       The OpenVPN configuration needs to contain this line:

          bind-dev vrf_external

</pre><h4><b>SCRIPTING</b> <b>INTEGRATION</b></h4><pre>
       OpenVPN can execute external scripts in various phases of the lifetime of the OpenVPN process.

   <b>Script</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> <b>Execution</b>
       1.  <b>--up</b>

           Executed after TCP/UDP socket bind and TUN/TAP open.

       2.  <b>--tls-verify</b>

           Executed when we have a still untrusted remote peer.

       3.  <b>--ipchange</b>

           Executed after connection authentication, or remote IP address change.

       4.  <b>--client-connect</b>

           Executed in <b>--mode</b> <b>server</b> mode immediately after client authentication.

       5.  <b>--route-up</b>

           Executed after connection authentication, either immediately after, or some number of  seconds  after
           as defined by the <b>--route-delay</b> option.

       6.  <b>--route-pre-down</b>

           Executed right before the routes are removed.

       7.  <b>--client-disconnect</b>

           Executed in <b>--mode</b> <b>server</b> mode on client instance shutdown.

       8.  <b>--down</b>

           Executed after TCP/UDP and TUN/TAP close.

       9.  <b>--learn-address</b>

           Executed  in  <b>--mode</b>  <b>server</b> mode whenever an IPv4 address/route or MAC address is added to OpenVPN's
           internal routing table.

       10. <b>--auth-user-pass-verify</b>

           Executed in <b>--mode</b> <b>server</b> mode on new client connections, when the client is still untrusted.

       11. <b>--client-crresponse</b>
              Execute in <b>--mode</b> <b>server</b> whenever a client sends a <b>CR_RESPONSE</b> message

   <b>SCRIPT</b> <b>HOOKS</b>
       <b>--auth-user-pass-verify</b> <u>args</u>
              Require the client to provide a username/password (possibly in addition to a  client  certificate)
              for authentication.

              Valid syntax:

                 auth-user-pass-verify cmd method

              OpenVPN will run command <b>cmd</b> to validate the username/password provided by the client.

              <b>cmd</b>  consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The
              path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be
              separated by one or more spaces.

              If <b>method</b> is set to <b>via-env</b>, OpenVPN will call <b>cmd</b> with the environmental variables  <b>username</b>  and
              <b>password</b>  set  to the username/password strings provided by the client. <u>Beware</u> that this method is
              insecure on some platforms which make the environment of  a  process  publicly  visible  to  other
              unprivileged processes.

              If  <b>method</b> is set to <b>via-file</b>, OpenVPN will write the username and password to the first two lines
              of a temporary file. The filename will be passed as an argument to  <b>cmd</b>,  and  the  file  will  be
              automatically  deleted  by OpenVPN after the script returns. The location of the temporary file is
              controlled by the <b>--tmp-dir</b> option, and will default to the current directory if unspecified.  For
              security,  consider setting <b>--tmp-dir</b> to a volatile storage medium such as <b><a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a></b> (if available)
              to prevent the username/password file from touching the hard drive.

              The script should examine the username and password, returning a success  exit  code  (<b>0</b>)  if  the
              client's  authentication  request is to be accepted, a failure code (<b>1</b>) to reject the client, or a
              that the authentication is deferred (<b>2</b>). If  the  authentication  is  deferred,  the  script  must
              fork/start  a  background  or another non-blocking operation to continue the authentication in the
              background. When finshing the authentication, a <b>1</b> or <b>0</b> must be written to the  file  specified  by
              the <b>auth_control_file</b>.

              If  the file specified by <b>auth_failed_reason_file</b> exists and has non-empty content, the content of
              this file will be used as AUTH_FAILED message. To avoid  race  conditions,  this  file  should  be
              written before <b>auth_control_file</b>.

              This  auth fail reason can be something simple like "User has been permanently disabled" but there
              are also some special auth failed messages.

              The <b>TEMP</b> message indicates that the authentication temporarily failed and that the  client  should
              continue to retry to connect.  The server can optionally give a user readable message and hint the
              client a behavior how to proceed. The keywords of the <b>AUTH_FAILED,TEMP</b> message are comma separated
              keys/values and provide a hint to the client how to proceed. Currently defined keywords are:

              <b>backoff</b> <b>s</b>
                     instructs  the client to wait at least <b>s</b> seconds before the next connection attempt. If the
                     client already uses a higher  delay  for  reconnection  attempt,  the  delay  will  not  be
                     shortened.

              <b>advance</b> <b>addr</b>
                     Instructs the client to reconnect to the next (IP) address of the current server.

              <b>advance</b> <b>remote</b>
                     Instructs  the  client to skip the remaining IP addresses of the current server and instead
                     connect to the next server specified in the configuration file.

              <b>advance</b> <b>no</b>
                     Instructs the client to retry connecting to the same server again.

              For example, the message <b>TEMP[backoff</b> <b>42,advance</b> <b>no]:</b> <b>No</b> <b>free</b> <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> indicates that the  VPN
              connection can currently not succeed and instructs the client to retry in 42 seconds again.

              When  deferred  authentication  is  in  use, the script can also request pending authentication by
              writing to the file specified by the <b>auth_pending_file</b>. The first line  must  be  the  timeout  in
              seconds,  the required method on the second line (e.g. crtext) and third line must be the EXTRA as
              documented in the <b>client-pending-auth</b> section of <u>doc/management.txt</u>.

              This  directive  is  designed  to  enable  a  plugin-style  interface  for   extending   OpenVPN's
              authentication capabilities.

              To protect against a client passing a maliciously formed username or password string, the username
              string must consist only of these characters: alphanumeric, underbar ('<b>_</b>'), dash ('<b>-</b>'), dot ('<b>.</b>'),
              or  at ('<b>@</b>'). The password string can consist of any printable characters except for CR or LF. Any
              illegal characters in either the username or password string will be converted to underbar ('<b>_</b>').

              Care must be taken by any user-defined scripts to avoid creating a security vulnerability  in  the
              way  that  these  strings  are  handled.  Never use these strings in such a way that they might be
              escaped or evaluated by a shell interpreter.

              For a sample script that  performs  PAM  authentication,  see  <b>sample-scripts/auth-pam.pl</b>  in  the
              OpenVPN source distribution.

       <b>--client-crresponse</b>
                 Executed when the client sends a text based challenge response.

                 Valid syntax:

                     client-crresponse cmd

              OpenVPN  will write the response of the client into a temporary file.  The filename will be passed
              as an argument to <b>cmd</b>, and the file will be automatically deleted  by  OpenVPN  after  the  script
              returns.

              The  response  is  passed  as is from the client. The script needs to check itself if the input is
              valid, e.g. if the input is valid base64 encoding.

              The script can either directly write the  result  of  the  verification  to  <b>auth_control_file</b>  <b>or</b>
              <b>further</b> <b>defer</b> <b>it.</b> <b>See</b> <b>`</b>--auth-user-pass-verify`` for details.

              For  a  sample  script  that  implement  TOTP  (RFC  6238)  based  two-factor  authentication, see
              <b>sample-scripts/totpauth.py</b>.

       <b>--client-connect</b> <u>cmd</u>
              Run command <b>cmd</b> on client connection.

              <b>cmd</b> consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments.  The
              path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be
              separated by one or more spaces.

              The  command  is  passed  the  common  name  and  IP  address  of the just-authenticated client as
              environmental variables (see environmental variable section below). The command is also passed the
              pathname of a freshly created temporary file as the last argument (after any  arguments  specified
              in  <b>cmd</b>  ), to be used by the command to pass dynamically generated config file directives back to
              OpenVPN.

              If the script wants to generate a dynamic config file to be applied on the server when the  client
              connects, it should write it to the file named by the last argument.

              See  the  <b>--client-config-dir</b>  option below for options which can be legally used in a dynamically
              generated config file.

              Note that the return value of <b>script</b> is significant. If <b>script</b> returns a non-zero error status, it
              will cause the client to be disconnected.

              If a <b>--client-connect</b> wants to defer the generating of the configuration then the script needs  to
              use  the  <b>client_connect_deferred_file</b>  and  <b>client_connect_config_file</b> environment variables, and
              write status accordingly into these files.  See  the  <u>Environmental</u>  <u>Variables</u>  section  for  more
              details.

       <b>--client-disconnect</b> <u>cmd</u>
              Like  <b>--client-connect</b>  but  called  on  client  instance  shutdown. Will not be called unless the
              <b>--client-connect</b> script and plugins (if defined) were previously  called  on  this  instance  with
              successful (0) status returns.

              The  exception  to this rule is if the <b>--client-disconnect</b> command or plugins are cascaded, and at
              least one client-connect function succeeded, then  ALL  of  the  client-disconnect  functions  for
              scripts and plugins will be called on client instance object deletion, even in cases where some of
              the related client-connect functions returned an error status.

              The  <b>--client-disconnect</b> command is not passed any extra arguments (only those arguments specified
              in cmd, if any).

       <b>--down</b> <u>cmd</u>
              Run command <b>cmd</b> after TUN/TAP device close (post <b>--user</b> UID change and/or <b>--chroot</b> ). <b>cmd</b> consists
              of a path to script (or executable program),  optionally  followed  by  arguments.  The  path  and
              arguments  may  be  single-  or  double-quoted  and/or  escaped  using  a backslash, and should be
              separated by one or more spaces.

              Called with the same parameters and environmental variables as the <b>--up</b> option above.

              Note that if you reduce privileges by using <b>--user</b> and/or <b>--group</b>, your <b>--down</b>  script  will  also
              run at reduced privilege.

       <b>--down-pre</b>
              Call <b>--down</b> cmd/script before, rather than after, TUN/TAP close.

       <b>--ipchange</b> <u>cmd</u>
              Run command <b>cmd</b> when our remote ip-address is initially authenticated or changes.

              <b>cmd</b>  consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The
              path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be
              separated by one or more spaces.

              When <b>cmd</b> is executed two arguments are appended after any arguments specified in <b>cmd</b> , as follows:

                 cmd ip address port number

              Don't use <b>--ipchange</b> in <b>--mode</b> <b>server</b> mode. Use a <b>--client-connect</b> script instead.

              See the <u>Environmental</u> <u>Variables</u> section below for additional parameters  passed  as  environmental
              variables.

              If you are running in a dynamic IP address environment where the IP addresses of either peer could
              change  without notice, you can use this script, for example, to edit the <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b> file with the
              current address of the peer. The script will be run every time the  remote  peer  changes  its  IP
              address.

              Similarly  if <u>our</u> IP address changes due to DHCP, we should configure our IP address change script
              (see man page for <b><a href="../man8/dhcpcd.8.html">dhcpcd</a></b>(8)) to deliver a <b>SIGHUP</b> or <b>SIGUSR1</b> signal to OpenVPN. OpenVPN  will  then
              re-establish a connection with its most recently authenticated peer on its new IP address.

       <b>--learn-address</b> <u>cmd</u>
              Run command <b>cmd</b> to validate client virtual addresses or routes.

              <b>cmd</b>  consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The
              path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be
              separated by one or more spaces.

              Three arguments will be appended to any arguments in <b>cmd</b> as follows:

              <b>$1</b> <b>-</b> <b>[operation]</b>
                     <b>"add"</b>, <b>"update"</b>, or <b>"delete"</b> based on whether  or  not  the  address  is  being  added  to,
                     modified, or deleted from OpenVPN's internal routing table.

              <b>$2</b> <b>-</b> <b>[address]</b>
                     The   address   being   learned  or  unlearned.  This  can  be  an  IPv4  address  such  as
                     <b>"198.162.10.14"</b>, an IPv4 subnet such as <b>"198.162.10.0/24"</b>, or an ethernet MAC address (when
                     <b>--dev</b> <b>tap</b> is being used) such as <b>"00:FF:01:02:03:04"</b>.

              <b>$3</b> <b>-</b> <b>[common</b> <b>name]</b>
                     The common name on the certificate associated with the client linked to this address.  Only
                     present for <b>"add"</b> or <b>"update"</b> operations, not <b>"delete"</b>.

              On <b>"add"</b> or <b>"update"</b> methods, if the script returns a failure code (non-zero), OpenVPN will reject
              the address and will not modify its internal routing table.

              Normally,  the  <b>cmd</b>  script  will  use  the information provided above to set appropriate firewall
              entries on the VPN TUN/TAP interface. Since OpenVPN provides the association between virtual IP or
              MAC address and the client's authenticated  common  name,  it  allows  a  user-defined  script  to
              configure firewall access policies with regard to the client's high-level common name, rather than
              the low level client virtual addresses.

       <b>--route-up</b> <u>cmd</u>
              Run command <b>cmd</b> after routes are added, subject to <b>--route-delay</b>.

              <b>cmd</b>  consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The
              path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be
              separated by one or more spaces.

              See the <u>Environmental</u> <u>Variables</u> section below for additional parameters  passed  as  environmental
              variables.

       <b>--route-pre-down</b> <u>cmd</u>
              Run command <b>cmd</b> before routes are removed upon disconnection.

              <b>cmd</b>  consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The
              path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be
              separated by one or more spaces.

              See the <u>Environmental</u> <u>Variables</u> section below for additional parameters  passed  as  environmental
              variables.

       <b>--setenv</b> <u>args</u>
              Set a custom environmental variable <b>name=value</b> to pass to script.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 setenv name value
                 setenv FORWARD_COMPATIBLE 1
                 setenv opt config_option

              By  setting  <b>FORWARD_COMPATIBLE</b>  to  <b>1</b>, the config file syntax checking is relaxed so that unknown
              directives will trigger a warning but not a fatal error, on the assumption that  a  given  unknown
              directive might be valid in future OpenVPN versions.

              This  option  should  be  used with caution, as there are good security reasons for having OpenVPN
              fail if it detects problems in a config file.  Having said  that,  there  are  valid  reasons  for
              wanting new software features to gracefully degrade when encountered by older software versions.

              It  is also possible to tag a single directive so as not to trigger a fatal error if the directive
              isn't recognized. To do this, prepend the following before the directive: <b>setenv</b> <b>opt</b>

              Versions prior to OpenVPN 2.3.3 will always ignore options set with the <b>setenv</b> <b>opt</b> directive.

              See also <b>--ignore-unknown-option</b>

       <b>--setenv-safe</b> <u>args</u>
              Set a custom environmental variable <b>OPENVPN_name</b> to <b>value</b> to pass to scripts.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 setenv-safe name value

              This directive is designed to be pushed by the server to clients, and the prepending  of  <b>OPENVPN_</b>
              to  the  environmental variable is a safety precaution to prevent a <b>LD_PRELOAD</b> style attack from a
              malicious or compromised server.

       <b>--tls-verify</b> <u>cmd</u>
              Run command <b>cmd</b> to verify the X509 name of a pending TLS connection that has otherwise passed  all
              other  tests  of  certification  (except for revocation via <b>--crl-verify</b> directive; the revocation
              test occurs after the <b>--tls-verify</b> test).

              <b>cmd</b> should return <b>0</b> to allow the TLS handshake to proceed, or <b>1</b> to fail.

              <b>cmd</b> consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments.  The
              path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be
              separated by one or more spaces.

              When <b>cmd</b> is executed two arguments are appended after any arguments specified in <b>cmd</b>, as follows:

                 cmd certificate_depth subject

              These   arguments   are,  respectively,  the  current  certificate  depth  and  the  X509  subject
              distinguished name (dn) of the peer.

              This feature is useful if the peer you want to trust has a  certificate  which  was  signed  by  a
              certificate authority who also signed many other certificates, where you don't necessarily want to
              trust  all  of  them,  but  rather be selective about which peer certificate you will accept. This
              feature allows you to write a script which will test the X509 name on  a  certificate  and  decide
              whether  or  not  it  should be accepted. For a simple perl script which will test the common name
              field on the certificate, see the file <b>verify-cn</b> in the OpenVPN distribution.

              See the <u>Environmental</u> <u>Variables</u> section below for additional parameters  passed  as  environmental
              variables.

       <b>--tls-export-cert</b> <u>dir</u>
              Adds  an  environment  variable  <b>peer_cert</b>  when  calling the <b>--tls-verify</b> script or executing the
              OPENVPN_PLUGIN_TLS_VERIFY plugin hook to verify the certificate.

              The environment variable contains the path to a  PEM  encoded  certificate  of  the  current  peer
              certificate in the directory <b>dir</b>.

       <b>--up</b> <u>cmd</u>
              Run command <b>cmd</b> after successful TUN/TAP device open (pre <b>--user</b> UID change).

              <b>cmd</b>  consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The
              path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be
              separated by one or more spaces.

              The up command is useful for specifying route commands which route IP traffic destined for private
              subnets which exist at the other end of the VPN connection into the tunnel.

              For <b>--dev</b> <b>tun</b> execute as:

                 cmd tun_dev tun_mtu 0 ifconfig_local_ip ifconfig_remote_ip [init | restart]

              For <b>--dev</b> <b>tap</b> execute as:

                 cmd tap_dev tap_mtu 0 ifconfig_local_ip ifconfig_netmask [init | restart]

              See the <u>Environmental</u> <u>Variables</u> section below for additional parameters  passed  as  environmental
              variables.   The <b>0</b> argument used to be <b>link_mtu</b> which is no longer passed to scripts - to keep the
              argument order, it was replaced with <b>0</b>.

              Note that if <b>cmd</b> includes arguments, all OpenVPN-generated arguments will be appended to  them  to
              build an argument list with which the executable will be called.

              Typically, <b>cmd</b> will run a script to add routes to the tunnel.

              Normally  the  up  script  is called after the TUN/TAP device is opened. In this context, the last
              command line parameter passed to the script will be <u>init.</u> If the <b>--up-restart</b> option is also used,
              the up script will be called for restarts as well.  A  restart  is  considered  to  be  a  partial
              reinitialization of OpenVPN where the TUN/TAP instance is preserved (the <b>--persist-tun</b> option will
              enable  such  preservation).   A  restart  can  be generated by a SIGUSR1 signal, a <b>--ping-restart</b>
              timeout, or a connection reset when the TCP protocol is enabled with  the  <b>--proto</b>  option.  If  a
              restart  occurs, and <b>--up-restart</b> has been specified, the up script will be called with <u>restart</u> as
              the last parameter.

              <u>NOTE:</u>  On restart, OpenVPN will not pass the full set of  environment  variables  to  the  script.
                     Namely,  everything related to routing and gateways will not be passed, as nothing needs to
                     be done anyway - all the routing setup is already in place.  Additionally,  the  up-restart
                     script will run with the downgraded UID/GID settings (if configured).

              The following standalone example shows how the <b>--up</b> script can be called in both an initialization
              and  restart context. (<u>NOTE:</u> for security reasons, don't run the following example unless UDP port
              9999 is blocked by your firewall. Also, the example will run indefinitely,  so  you  should  abort
              with control-c).

                 openvpn --dev tun --port 9999 --verb 4 --ping-restart 10 \
                         --up 'echo up' --down 'echo down' --persist-tun  \
                         --up-restart

              Note  that  OpenVPN  also provides the <b>--ifconfig</b> option to automatically ifconfig the TUN device,
              eliminating the need to define an <b>--up</b> script, unless you also want to  configure  routes  in  the
              <b>--up</b> script.

              If  <b>--ifconfig</b> is also specified, OpenVPN will pass the ifconfig local and remote endpoints on the
              command line to the <b>--up</b> script so that they can be used to configure routes such as:

                 route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw $5

       <b>--up-delay</b>
              Delay TUN/TAP open and possible <b>--up</b> script execution until after TCP/UDP connection establishment
              with peer.

              In <b>--proto</b> <b>udp</b> mode, this  option  normally  requires  the  use  of  <b>--ping</b>  to  allow  connection
              initiation to be sensed in the absence of tunnel data, since UDP is a "connectionless" protocol.

              On  Windows,  this  option will delay the TAP-Win32 media state transitioning to "connected" until
              connection establishment, i.e. the receipt of the first authenticated packet from the peer.

       <b>--up-restart</b>
              Enable the <b>--up</b> and <b>--down</b> scripts to be called for restarts as well  as  initial  program  start.
              This option is described more fully above in the <b>--up</b> option documentation.

   <b>String</b> <b>Types</b> <b>and</b> <b>Remapping</b>
       In  certain  cases,  OpenVPN will perform remapping of characters in strings. Essentially, any characters
       outside the set of permitted characters for each string type will be converted to underbar ('_').

       <u>Q:</u> <u>Why</u> <u>is</u> <u>string</u> <u>remapping</u> <u>necessary?</u>
              It's an important security feature to prevent the  malicious  coding  of  strings  from  untrusted
              sources  to  be  passed as parameters to scripts, saved in the environment, used as a common name,
              translated to a filename, etc.

       <u>Q:</u> <u>Can</u> <u>string</u> <u>remapping</u> <u>be</u> <u>disabled?</u>
              Yes, by using the <b>--no-name-remapping</b> option,  however  this  should  be  considered  an  advanced
              option.

       Here  is  a  brief  rundown  of OpenVPN's current string types and the permitted character class for each
       string:

       <u>X509</u> <u>Names</u>
              Alphanumeric, underbar ('_'), dash ('-'), dot ('.'), at ('@'), colon (':'), slash ('/'), and equal
              ('='). Alphanumeric is defined as a character which will cause the C library isalnum() function to
              return true.

       <u>Common</u> <u>Names</u>
              Alphanumeric, underbar ('_'), dash ('-'), dot ('.'), and at ('@').

       <u>--auth-user-pass</u> <u>username</u>
              Same as Common Name, with one exception: starting with OpenVPN 2.0.1, the username  is  passed  to
              the <b>OPENVPN_PLUGIN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY</b> plugin in its raw form, without string remapping.

       <u>--auth-user-pass</u> <u>password</u>
              Any "printable" character except CR or LF. Printable is defined to be a character which will cause
              the C library isprint() function to return true.

       <u>--client-config-dir</u> <u>filename</u> <u>as</u> <u>derived</u> <u>from</u> <u>common</u> <u>name</u> <u>or`username</u>
              Alphanumeric,  underbar  ('_'),  dash  ('-'),  and  dot ('.') except for "." or ".." as standalone
              strings. As of v2.0.1-rc6, the at ('@') character has been added as well  for  compatibility  with
              the common name character class.

       <u>Environmental</u> <u>variable</u> <u>names</u>
              Alphanumeric or underbar ('_').

       <u>Environmental</u> <u>variable</u> <u>values</u>
              Any printable character.

       For  all cases, characters in a string which are not members of the legal character class for that string
       type will be remapped to underbar ('_').

   <b>Environmental</b> <b>Variables</b>
       Once set, a variable is persisted indefinitely until it is reset by a new value or a restart,

       As of OpenVPN 2.0-beta12, in server mode, environmental variables set by OpenVPN are scoped according  to
       the client objects they are associated with, so there should not be any issues with scripts having access
       to stale, previously set variables which refer to different client instances.

       <b>bytes_received</b>
              Total  number  of  bytes  received  from  client during VPN session. Set prior to execution of the
              <b>--client-disconnect</b> script.

       <b>bytes_sent</b>
              Total number of bytes  sent  to  client  during  VPN  session.  Set  prior  to  execution  of  the
              <b>--client-disconnect</b> script.

       <b>client_connect_config_file</b>
              The  path  to  the  configuration  file  that  should be written to by the <b>--client-connect</b> script
              (optional, if per-session configuration is desired).  This is the same file  name  as  passed  via
              command line argument on the call to the <b>--client-connect</b> script.

       <b>client_connect_deferred_file</b>
              This  file  can  be  optionally  written  to  in  order  to  to  communicate  a status code of the
              <b>--client-connect</b> script or plgin.  Only the first character in the file is relevant.  It  must  be
              either  <b>1</b>  to  indicate  normal script execution, <b>0</b> indicates an error (in the same way that a non
              zero exit status does) or <b>2</b> to indicate that the script deferred returning the config file.

              For deferred (background) handling, the script or plugin MUST write <b>2</b> to the file to indicate  the
              deferral and then return with exit code <b>0</b> to signal <b>deferred</b> <b>handler</b> <b>started</b> <b>OK</b>.

              A  background  process  or  similar  must  then take care of writing the configuration to the file
              indicated by the <b>client_connect_config_file</b> environment variable and when finished, write the a  <b>1</b>
              to this file (or <b>0</b> in case of an error).

              The  absence  of  any  character in the file when the script finishes executing is interpreted the
              same as <b>1</b>. This allows scripts that are not written to support the  defer  mechanism  to  be  used
              unmodified.

       <b>common_name</b>
              The  X509  common  name  of  an  authenticated client. Set prior to execution of <b>--client-connect</b>,
              <b>--client-disconnect</b> and <b>--auth-user-pass-verify</b> scripts.

       <b>config</b> Name of first <b>--config</b> file. Set on program initiation and reset on SIGHUP.

       <b>daemon</b> Set to "1" if the <b>--daemon</b> directive is specified, or "0" otherwise.  Set  on  program  initiation
              and reset on SIGHUP.

       <b>daemon_log_redirect</b>
              Set to "1" if the <b>--log</b> or <b>--log-append</b> directives are specified, or "0" otherwise. Set on program
              initiation and reset on SIGHUP.

       <b>dev</b>    The  actual name of the TUN/TAP device, including a unit number if it exists. Set prior to <b>--up</b> or
              <b>--down</b> script execution.

       <b>dev_idx</b>
              On Windows, the device index of the TUN/TAP adapter (to be used in netsh.exe calls which sometimes
              just do not work right with interface names). Set prior to <b>--up</b> or <b>--down</b> script execution.

       <b>dns_*</b>  The <b>--dns</b> configuration options will be made available to script execution  through  this  set  of
              environment variables. Variables appear only if the corresponding option has a value assigned. For
              the semantics of each individual variable, please refer to the documentation for <b>--dns</b>.

                 dns_search_domain_{n}
                 dns_server_{n}_address_{m}
                 dns_server_{n}_port_{m}
                 dns_server_{n}_resolve_domain_{m}
                 dns_server_{n}_dnssec
                 dns_server_{n}_transport
                 dns_server_{n}_sni

       <b>foreign_option_{n}</b>
              An  option pushed via <b>--push</b> to a client which does not natively support it, such as <b>--dhcp-option</b>
              on a non-Windows system, will be recorded to this environmental variable sequence  prior  to  <b>--up</b>
              script execution.

       <b>ifconfig_broadcast</b>
              The broadcast address for the virtual ethernet segment which is derived from the <b>--ifconfig</b> option
              when  <b>--dev</b>  <b>tap</b>  is  used. Set prior to OpenVPN calling the <b>ifconfig</b> or <b>netsh</b> (windows version of
              ifconfig) commands which normally occurs prior to <b>--up</b> script execution.

       <b>ifconfig_ipv6_local</b>
              The local VPN endpoint IPv6 address specified in the <b>--ifconfig-ipv6</b> option (first parameter). Set
              prior to OpenVPN calling the <b>ifconfig</b> or code:<u>netsh</u> (windows version of ifconfig)  commands  which
              normally occurs prior to <b>--up</b> script execution.

       <b>ifconfig_ipv6_netbits</b>
              The prefix length of the IPv6 network on the VPN interface. Derived from the /nnn parameter of the
              IPv6  address  in  the  <b>--ifconfig-ipv6</b> option (first parameter). Set prior to OpenVPN calling the
              <b>ifconfig</b> or <b>netsh</b> (windows version of ifconfig) commands  which  normally  occurs  prior  to  <b>--up</b>
              script execution.

       <b>ifconfig_ipv6_remote</b>
              The  remote  VPN endpoint IPv6 address specified in the <b>--ifconfig-ipv6</b> option (second parameter).
              Set prior to OpenVPN calling the <b>ifconfig</b> or <b>netsh</b> (windows version of  ifconfig)  commands  which
              normally occurs prior to <b>--up</b> script execution.

       <b>ifconfig_local</b>
              The  local VPN endpoint IP address specified in the <b>--ifconfig</b> option (first parameter). Set prior
              to OpenVPN calling the <b>ifconfig</b> or <b>netsh</b> (windows version of  ifconfig)  commands  which  normally
              occurs prior to <b>--up</b> script execution.

       <b>ifconfig_remote</b>
              The  remote  VPN  endpoint  IP  address specified in the <b>--ifconfig</b> option (second parameter) when
              <b>--dev</b> <b>tun</b> is used. Set prior to  OpenVPN  calling  the  <b>ifconfig</b>  or  <b>netsh</b>  (windows  version  of
              ifconfig) commands which normally occurs prior to <b>--up</b> script execution.

       <b>ifconfig_netmask</b>
              The  subnet  mask  of  the  virtual  ethernet segment that is specified as the second parameter to
              <b>--ifconfig</b> when <b>--dev</b> <b>tap</b> is being used. Set prior  to  OpenVPN  calling  the  <b>ifconfig</b>  or  <b>netsh</b>
              (windows version of ifconfig) commands which normally occurs prior to <b>--up</b> script execution.

       <b>ifconfig_pool_local_ip</b>
              The  local  virtual  IP  address for the TUN/TAP tunnel taken from an <b>--ifconfig-push</b> directive if
              specified, or otherwise from the ifconfig pool (controlled  by  the  <b>--ifconfig-pool</b>  config  file
              directive). Only set for <b>--dev</b> <b>tun</b> tunnels. This option is set on the server prior to execution of
              the <b>--client-connect</b> and <b>--client-disconnect</b> scripts.

       <b>ifconfig_pool_netmask</b>
              The  virtual  IP  netmask  for  the  TUN/TAP  tunnel  taken  from  an <b>--ifconfig-push</b> directive if
              specified, or otherwise from the ifconfig pool (controlled  by  the  <b>--ifconfig-pool</b>  config  file
              directive). Only set for <b>--dev</b> <b>tap</b> tunnels. This option is set on the server prior to execution of
              the <b>--client-connect</b> and <b>--client-disconnect</b> scripts.

       <b>ifconfig_pool_remote_ip</b>
              The  remote  virtual  IP address for the TUN/TAP tunnel taken from an <b>--ifconfig-push</b> directive if
              specified, or otherwise from the ifconfig pool (controlled  by  the  <b>--ifconfig-pool</b>  config  file
              directive).  This  option  is  set  on  the  server prior to execution of the <b>--client-connect</b> and
              <b>--client-disconnect</b> scripts.

       <b>link_mtu</b>
              No longer passed to scripts since OpenVPN  2.6.0.   Used  to  be  the  maximum  packet  size  (not
              including the IP header) of tunnel data in UDP tunnel transport mode.

       <b>local</b>  The <b>--local</b> parameter. Set on program initiation and reset on SIGHUP.

       <b>local_port</b>
              The  local  port  number  or  name, specified by <b>--port</b> or <b>--lport</b>.  Set on program initiation and
              reset on SIGHUP.

       <b>password</b>
              The password provided  by  a  connecting  client.  Set  prior  to  <b>--auth-user-pass-verify</b>  script
              execution  only when the <b>via-env</b> modifier is specified, and deleted from the environment after the
              script returns.

       <b>peer_cert</b>
              If the option <b>--tls-export-cert</b> is enabled, this option contains the  path  to  the  current  peer
              certificate  to  be  verified  in  PEM  format.   See  also  the argument certificate_depth to the
              <b>--tls-verify</b> command.

       <b>proto</b>  The <b>--proto</b> parameter. Set on program initiation and reset on SIGHUP.

       <b>remote_{n}</b>
              The <b>--remote</b> parameter. Set on program initiation and reset on SIGHUP.

       <b>remote_port_{n}</b>
              The remote port number, specified by <b>--port</b> or <b>--rport</b>. Set on program  initiation  and  reset  on
              SIGHUP.

       <b>route_net_gateway</b>
              The  pre-existing  default  IP  gateway  in  the  system  routing  table. Set prior to <b>--up</b> script
              execution.

       <b>route_vpn_gateway</b>
              The default gateway used by <b>--route</b> options, as specified in either the <b>--route-gateway</b> option  or
              the  second  parameter  to  <b>--ifconfig</b>  when  <b>--dev</b>  <b>tun</b>  is  specified.  Set prior to <b>--up</b> script
              execution.

       <b>route_{parm}_{n}</b>
              A set of variables which define each route  to  be  added,  and  are  set  prior  to  <b>--up</b>  script
              execution.

              <b>parm</b> will be one of <b>network</b>, <b>netmask"</b>, <b>gateway</b>, or <b>metric</b>.

              <b>n</b> is the OpenVPN route number, starting from 1.

              If the network or gateway are resolvable DNS names, their IP address translations will be recorded
              rather than their names as denoted on the command line or configuration file.

       <b>route_ipv6_{parm}_{n}</b>
              A  set  of  variables  which  define each IPv6 route to be added, and are set prior to <b>--up</b> script
              execution.

              <b>parm</b> will be one of <b>network</b>, <b>gateway</b> or <b>metric</b>. <b>route_ipv6_network_{n}</b> contains <b>netmask</b>  as  <b>/nnn</b>,
              unlike IPv4 where it is passed in a separate environment variable.

              <b>n</b> is the OpenVPN route number, starting from 1.

              If the network or gateway are resolvable DNS names, their IP address translations will be recorded
              rather than their names as denoted on the command line or configuration file.

       <b>script_context</b>
              Set  to  "init"  or  "restart"  prior  to  up/down  script  execution.  For  more information, see
              documentation for <b>--up</b>.

       <b>script_type</b>
              Prior to execution of any script, this variable is set to the type of script being run. It can  be
              one   of   the   following:  <b>up</b>,  <b>down</b>,  <b>ipchange</b>,  <b>route-up</b>,  <b>tls-verify</b>,  <b>auth-user-pass-verify</b>,
              <b>client-connect</b>, <b>client-disconnect</b> or <b>learn-address</b>. Set prior to execution of any script.

       <b>signal</b> The reason for exit or  restart.  Can  be  one  of  <b>sigusr1</b>,  <b>sighup</b>,  <b>sigterm</b>,  <b>sigint</b>,  <b>inactive</b>
              (controlled  by  <b>--inactive</b>  option),  <b>ping-exit</b>  (controlled by <b>--ping-exit</b> option), <b>ping-restart</b>
              (controlled by <b>--ping-restart</b> option), <b>connection-reset</b> (triggered on TCP connection reset), <b>error</b>
              or <b>unknown</b> (unknown signal).  This variable is set just prior to down script execution.

       <b>time_ascii</b>
              Client connection timestamp, formatted as a human-readable time string.  Set prior to execution of
              the <b>--client-connect</b> script.

       <b>time_duration</b>
              The duration (in seconds) of the client session which is now disconnecting. Set prior to execution
              of the <b>--client-disconnect</b> script.

       <b>time_unix</b>
              Client connection timestamp, formatted as a unix integer date/time value. Set prior  to  execution
              of the <b>--client-connect</b> script.

       <b>tls_digest_{n}</b> <b>/</b> <b>tls_digest_sha256_{n}</b>
              Contains  the  certificate  SHA1 / SHA256 fingerprint, where <b>n</b> is the verification level. Only set
              for TLS connections. Set prior to execution of <b>--tls-verify</b> script.

       <b>tls_id_{n}</b>
              A series of certificate fields from the remote peer, where <b>n</b> is the verification level.  Only  set
              for TLS connections. Set prior to execution of <b>--tls-verify</b> script.

       <b>tls_serial_{n}</b>
              The serial number of the certificate from the remote peer, where <b>n</b> is the verification level. Only
              set  for  TLS connections. Set prior to execution of <b>--tls-verify</b> script. This is in the form of a
              decimal string like "933971680", which is suitable  for  doing  serial-based  OCSP  queries  (with
              OpenSSL,  do  not prepend "0x" to the string) If something goes wrong while reading the value from
              the  certificate  it  will  be  an  empty  string,  so  your  code  should  check  that.  See  the
              <b>contrib/OCSP_check/OCSP_check.sh</b> script for an example.

       <b>tls_serial_hex_{n}</b>
              Like <b>tls_serial_{n}</b>, but in hex form (e.g.  <b>12:34:56:78:9A</b>).

       <b>tun_mtu</b>
              The MTU of the TUN/TAP device. Set prior to <b>--up</b> or <b>--down</b> script execution.

       <b>trusted_ip</b> <b>/</b> <b>trusted_ip6)</b>
              Actual  IP  address  of  connecting  client  or  peer  which  has been authenticated. Set prior to
              execution of <b>--ipchange</b>, <b>--client-connect</b> and <b>--client-disconnect</b> scripts. If using ipv6 endpoints
              (udp6, tcp6), <b>trusted_ip6</b> will be set instead.

       <b>trusted_port</b>
              Actual port number of connecting client or  peer  which  has  been  authenticated.  Set  prior  to
              execution of <b>--ipchange</b>, <b>--client-connect</b> and <b>--client-disconnect</b> scripts.

       <b>untrusted_ip</b> <b>/</b> <b>untrusted_ip6</b>
              Actual  IP  address  of  connecting client or peer which has not been authenticated yet. Sometimes
              used to <u>nmap</u> the connecting host in a <b>--tls-verify</b> script to ensure it is firewalled properly. Set
              prior to execution of <b>--tls-verify</b> and <b>--auth-user-pass-verify</b> scripts. If  using  ipv6  endpoints
              (udp6, tcp6), <b>untrusted_ip6</b> will be set instead.

       <b>untrusted_port</b>
              Actual port number of connecting client or peer which has not been authenticated yet. Set prior to
              execution of <b>--tls-verify</b> and <b>--auth-user-pass-verify</b> scripts.

       <b>username</b>
              The  username  provided  by  a  connecting  client.  Set  prior  to <b>--auth-user-pass-verify</b> script
              execution only when the <b>via-env</b> modifier is specified.

       <b>X509_{n}_{subject_field}</b>
              An X509 subject field from the remote peer certificate, where <b>n</b> is the  verification  level.  Only
              set  for  TLS connections. Set prior to execution of <b>--tls-verify</b> script. This variable is similar
              to <b>tls_id_{n}</b> except the component X509 subject fields are broken out,  and  no  string  remapping
              occurs on these field values (except for remapping of control characters to "<b>_</b>"). For example, the
              following  variables  would  be  set  on the OpenVPN server using the sample client certificate in
              sample-keys (client.crt). Note that the verification level is 0 for the client certificate  and  1
              for the CA certificate.

              You can use the <b>--x509-track</b> option to export more or less information from the certificates.

                 X509_0_emailAddress=<a href="mailto:me@myhost.mydomain">me@myhost.mydomain</a>

   <b>Management</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Options</b>
       OpenVPN  provides  a  feature  rich  socket  based  management  interface for both server and client mode
       operations.

       <b>--management</b> <u>args</u>
              Enable a management server on a <b>socket-name</b> Unix socket on those platforms supporting it, or on  a
              designated TCP port.

              Valid syntaxes:

                 management socket-name unix          #
                 management socket-name unix pw-file  # (recommended)
                 management IP port                   # (INSECURE)
                 management IP port pw-file           #

              <b>pw-file</b>,  if  specified, is a password file where the password must be on first line. Instead of a
              filename it can use the keyword stdin which will prompt the  user  for  a  password  to  use  when
              OpenVPN is starting.

              For unix sockets, the default behaviour is to create a unix domain socket that may be connected to
              by  any  process.  Use  the  <b>--management-client-user</b>  and <b>--management-client-group</b> directives to
              restrict access.

              The management interface provides a special mode where the TCP management link  can  operate  over
              the  tunnel  itself.  To enable this mode, set IP to <b>tunnel</b>. Tunnel mode will cause the management
              interface to listen for a TCP connection on the local VPN address of the TUN/TAP interface.

              <b>*BEWARE*</b> of enabling the management interface over TCP. In these cases you should <u>ALWAYS</u> make  use
              of  <b>pw-file</b>  to  password  protect  the management interface. Any user who can connect to this TCP
              <b>IP:port</b> will be able to manage and control (and interfere with) the OpenVPN process.  It  is  also
              strongly  recommended  to  set  IP  to  127.0.0.1  (localhost)  to  restrict  accessibility of the
              management server to local clients.

              While the management port is designed for programmatic control of OpenVPN by  other  applications,
              it  is  possible  to telnet to the port, using a telnet client in "raw" mode. Once connected, type
              <b>help</b> for a list of commands.

              For detailed documentation on the management interface, see the <u>management-notes.txt</u> file  in  the
              management folder of the OpenVPN source distribution.

       <b>--management-client</b>
              Management interface will connect as a TCP/unix domain client to <b>IP:port</b> specified by <b>--management</b>
              rather than listen as a TCP server or on a unix domain socket.

              If  the  client connection fails to connect or is disconnected, a SIGTERM signal will be generated
              causing OpenVPN to quit.

       <b>--management-client-auth</b>
              Gives management interface client the responsibility to authenticate clients  after  their  client
              certificate  has  been  verified.  See  <b>management-notes.txt</b>  in OpenVPN distribution for detailed
              notes.

       <b>--management-client-group</b> <u>g</u>
              When the management interface is listening on a unix domain socket, only  allow  connections  from
              group <b>g</b>.

       <b>--management-client-user</b> <u>u</u>
              When  the  management  interface is listening on a unix domain socket, only allow connections from
              user <b>u</b>.

       <b>--management-external-cert</b> <u>certificate-hint</u>
              Allows usage for external certificate instead of <b>--cert</b> option (client-only). <b>certificate-hint</b>  is
              an  arbitrary  string  which  is  passed  to  a  management  interface  client  as  an argument of
              <u>NEED-CERTIFICATE</u> notification. Requires <b>--management-external-key</b>.

       <b>--management-external-key</b> <u>args</u>
              Allows usage for external private key file instead of <b>--key</b> option (client-only).

              Valid syntaxes:

                 management-external-key
                 management-external-key nopadding
                 management-external-key pkcs1
                 management-external-key pss

              or any combination like:

                 management-external-key nopadding pkcs1
                 management-external-key pkcs1 pss

              The optional parameters <b>nopadding</b> <b>pkcs1</b> and <b>pss</b> signal support for different  padding  algorithms.
              See <b>doc/mangement-notes.txt</b> for a complete description of this feature.

       <b>--management-forget-disconnect</b>
              Make OpenVPN forget passwords when management session disconnects.

              This directive does not affect the <b>--http-proxy</b> username/password.  It is always cached.

       <b>--management-hold</b>
              Start OpenVPN in a hibernating state, until a client of the management interface explicitly starts
              it with the <b>hold</b> <b>release</b> command.

       <b>--management-log-cache</b> <u>n</u>
              Cache the most recent <b>n</b> lines of log file history for usage by the management channel.

       <b>--management-query-passwords</b>
              Query  management  channel  for  private key password and <b>--auth-user-pass</b> username/password. Only
              query the management channel for inputs which ordinarily would have been queried from the console.

       <b>--management-query-proxy</b>
              Query management channel for proxy server information for a specific <b>--remote</b> (client-only).

       <b>--management-query-remote</b>
              Allow management interface to override <b>--remote</b> directives (client-only).

       <b>--management-signal</b>
              Send SIGUSR1 signal to OpenVPN if management session disconnects. This is useful when you wish  to
              disconnect  an  OpenVPN session on user logoff.  For <b>--management-client</b> this option is not needed
              since a disconnect will always generate a <b>SIGTERM</b>.

       <b>--management-up-down</b>
              Report tunnel up/down events to management interface.

   <b>Plug-in</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Options</b>
       OpenVPN can be extended by loading external plug-in modules at runtime.  These plug-ins must be  prebuilt
       and adhere to the OpenVPN Plug-In API.

       <b>--plugin</b> <u>args</u>
              Loads an OpenVPN plug-in module.

              Valid syntax:

                 plugin module-name
                 plugin module-name "arguments"

              The  <b>module-name</b>  needs  to  be  the  first  argument, indicating the plug-in to load.  The second
              argument is an optional init string which will be passed directly to the  plug-in.   If  the  init
              consists  of multiple arguments it must be enclosed in double-quotes (").  Multiple plugin modules
              may be loaded into one OpenVPN process.

              The <b>module-name</b> argument can be just a filename or a filename with a relative  or  absolute  path.
              The  format  of the filename and path defines if the plug-in will be loaded from a default plug-in
              directory or outside this directory.

                 --plugin path         Effective directory used
                 ===================== =============================
                  myplug.so            DEFAULT_DIR/myplug.so
                  subdir/myplug.so     DEFAULT_DIR/subdir/myplug.so
                  ./subdir/myplug.so   CWD/subdir/myplug.so
                  /usr/lib/my/plug.so  /usr/lib/my/plug.so

              <b>DEFAULT_DIR</b> is replaced by the default plug-in directory, which is configured at the build time of
              OpenVPN. <b>CWD</b> is the current directory where OpenVPN was started  or  the  directory  OpenVPN  have
              switched into via the <b>--cd</b> option before the <b>--plugin</b> option.

              For  more information and examples on how to build OpenVPN plug-in modules, see the README file in
              the <b>plugin</b> folder of the OpenVPN source distribution.

              If you are using an RPM install of OpenVPN, see <b>/usr/share/openvpn/plugin</b>. The documentation is in
              <b>doc</b> and the actual plugin modules are in <b>lib</b>.

              Multiple plugin modules can be cascaded, and modules can be  used  in  tandem  with  scripts.  The
              modules  will be called by OpenVPN in the order that they are declared in the config file. If both
              a plugin and script are configured for the same callback, the script will be called last.  If  the
              return  code  of  the  module/script  controls  an  authentication  function  (such as tls-verify,
              auth-user-pass-verify, or client-connect), then every module and script must return success (<b>0</b>) in
              order for the connection to be authenticated.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                     Plug-ins may do deferred execution, meaning the plug-in will return the control back to the
                     main OpenVPN process and provide the plug-in result later on  via  a  different  thread  or
                     process.   OpenVPN  does  <b>NOT</b>  support multiple authentication plug-ins <b>where</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b>
                     <b>plugin</b> tries to do deferred authentication.  If this behaviour is  detected,  OpenVPN  will
                     shut down upon first authentication.

   <b>Windows-Specific</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--allow-nonadmin</b> <u>TAP-adapter</u>
              (Standalone)  Set  <b>TAP-adapter</b> to allow access from non-administrative accounts. If <b>TAP-adapter</b> is
              omitted, all TAP adapters on the  system  will  be  configured  to  allow  non-admin  access.  The
              non-admin access setting will only persist for the length of time that the TAP-Win32 device object
              and  driver  remain  loaded,  and  will  need to be re-enabled after a reboot, or if the driver is
              unloaded and reloaded. This directive can only be used by an administrator.

       <b>--block-outside-dns</b>
              Block DNS servers on other network adapters  to  prevent  DNS  leaks.  This  option  prevents  any
              application  from  accessing  TCP  or  UDP  port  53 except one inside the tunnel. It uses Windows
              Filtering Platform (WFP) and works on Windows Vista or later.

              This option is considered  unknown  on  non-Windows  platforms  and  unsupported  on  Windows  XP,
              resulting  in  fatal  error.  You  may  want  to  use <b>--setenv</b> <b>opt</b> or <b>--ignore-unknown-option</b> (not
              suitable for Windows XP) to ignore said error. Note that pushing unknown options from server  does
              not trigger fatal errors.

       <b>--cryptoapicert</b> <u>select-string</u>
              <u>(Windows/OpenSSL</u>  <u>Only)</u>  Load  the certificate and private key from the Windows Certificate System
              Store.

              Use this option instead of <b>--cert</b> and <b>--key</b>.

              This makes it possible to use any  smart  card,  supported  by  Windows,  but  also  any  kind  of
              certificate, residing in the Cert Store, where you have access to the private key. This option has
              been  tested  with a couple of different smart cards (GemSAFE, Cryptoflex, and Swedish Post Office
              eID) on the client side, and also an imported PKCS12 software certificate on the server side.

              To select a certificate, based on a substring search in the certificate's subject:

                 cryptoapicert "SUBJ:Peter Runestig"

              To select a certificate, based on certificate's thumbprint (SHA1 hash):

                 cryptoapicert "THUMB:f6 49 24 41 01 b4 ..."

              The thumbprint hex string can easily be copy-and-pasted from the Windows  Certificate  Store  GUI.
              The embedded spaces in the hex string are optional.

              To select a certificate based on a substring in certificate's issuer name:

                 cryptoapicert "ISSUER:Sample CA"

              The  first non-expired certificate found in the user's store or the machine store that matches the
              select-string is used.

       <b>--dhcp-release</b>
              Ask Windows to release the TAP adapter lease on shutdown. This option has no effect now, as it  is
              enabled by default starting with OpenVPN 2.4.1.

       <b>--dhcp-renew</b>
              Ask  Windows  to  renew  the TAP adapter lease on startup. This option is normally unnecessary, as
              Windows automatically triggers a DHCP renegotiation on the TAP adapter when it comes  up,  however
              if  you  set  the TAP-Win32 adapter Media Status property to "Always Connected", you may need this
              flag.

       <b>--ip-win32</b> <u>method</u>
              When using <b>--ifconfig</b> on Windows, set the TAP-Win32 adapter IP address and netmask  using  <b>method</b>.
              Don't use this option unless you are also using <b>--ifconfig</b>.

              <b>manual</b> Don't  set the IP address or netmask automatically. Instead output a message to the console
                     telling the user to configure the adapter manually  and  indicating  the  IP/netmask  which
                     OpenVPN expects the adapter to be set to.

              <b>dynamic</b> <b>[offset]</b> <b>[lease-time]</b>
                     Automatically  set  the IP address and netmask by replying to DHCP query messages generated
                     by the kernel.  This mode is probably  the  "cleanest"  solution  for  setting  the  TCP/IP
                     properties   since   it  uses  the  well-known  DHCP  protocol.  There  are,  however,  two
                     prerequisites for using this mode:

                     1. The TCP/IP properties for the TAP-Win32 adapter must be set to  "Obtain  an  IP  address
                        automatically", and

                     2. OpenVPN  needs  to  claim an IP address in the subnet for use as the virtual DHCP server
                        address.

                     By default in <b>--dev</b> <b>tap</b> mode, OpenVPN will take the normally unused first  address  in  the
                     subnet. For example, if your subnet is <b>192.168.4.0</b> <b>netmask</b> <b>255.255.255.0</b>, then OpenVPN will
                     take  the  IP  address <b>192.168.4.0</b> to use as the virtual DHCP server address.  In <b>--dev</b> <b>tun</b>
                     mode, OpenVPN will cause the DHCP server to masquerade as if it were coming from the remote
                     endpoint.

                     The optional offset parameter is an integer which is &gt; <b>-256</b> and &lt; <b>256</b> and which defaults to
                     0. If offset is positive, the DHCP server will masquerade as  the  IP  address  at  network
                     address  + offset. If offset is negative, the DHCP server will masquerade as the IP address
                     at broadcast address + offset.

                     The Windows <b>ipconfig</b> <b>/all</b> command can be used to show what Windows thinks the  DHCP  server
                     address  is.  OpenVPN will "claim" this address, so make sure to use a free address. Having
                     said  that,  different  OpenVPN  instantiations,  including  different  ends  of  the  same
                     connection, can share the same virtual DHCP server address.

                     The  <b>lease-time</b>  parameter  controls  the  lease  time  of the DHCP assignment given to the
                     TAP-Win32 adapter, and is denoted in seconds. Normally a very long lease time is  preferred
                     because  it prevents routes involving the TAP-Win32 adapter from being lost when the system
                     goes to sleep. The default lease time is one year.

              <b>netsh</b>  Automatically set the IP  address  and  netmask  using  the  Windows  command-line  "netsh"
                     command. This method appears to work correctly on Windows XP but not Windows 2000.

              <b>ipapi</b>  Automatically set the IP address and netmask using the Windows IP Helper API. This approach
                     does not have ideal semantics, though testing has indicated that it works okay in practice.
                     If you use this option, it is best to leave the TCP/IP properties for the TAP-Win32 adapter
                     in their default state, i.e. "Obtain an IP address automatically."

              <b>adaptive</b> <b>(Default)</b>
                     Try  <b>dynamic</b>  method  initially  and  fail  over  to <b>netsh</b> if the DHCP negotiation with the
                     TAP-Win32 adapter does not succeed in 20 seconds. Such failures have been  known  to  occur
                     when  certain  third-party firewall packages installed on the client machine block the DHCP
                     negotiation used by the TAP-Win32 adapter. Note that if  the  <b>netsh</b>  failover  occurs,  the
                     TAP-Win32  adapter TCP/IP properties will be reset from DHCP to static, and this will cause
                     future OpenVPN startups using the <b>adaptive</b> mode  to  use  <b>netsh</b>  immediately,  rather  than
                     trying <b>dynamic</b> first.

                     To  "unstick"  the  <b>adaptive</b>  mode  from  using  <b>netsh</b>, run OpenVPN at least once using the
                     <b>dynamic</b> mode to restore the TAP-Win32 adapter TCP/IP properties to a DHCP configuration.

       <b>--pause-exit</b>
              Put up a "press any key to continue" message on the console prior to OpenVPN  program  exit.  This
              option  is  automatically used by the Windows explorer when OpenVPN is run on a configuration file
              using the right-click explorer menu.

       <b>--register-dns</b>
              Run <b>ipconfig</b> <b>/flushdns</b> and <b>ipconfig</b> <b>/registerdns</b> on connection initiation. This is known  to  kick
              Windows into recognizing pushed DNS servers.

       <b>--route-method</b> <u>m</u>
              Which method <b>m</b> to use for adding routes on Windows?

              <b>adaptive</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     Try IP helper API first. If that fails, fall back to the route.exe shell command.

              <b>ipapi</b>  Use IP helper API.

              <b>exe</b>    Call the route.exe shell command.

       <b>--service</b> <u>args</u>
              Should  be  used when OpenVPN is being automatically executed by another program in such a context
              that no interaction with the user via display or keyboard is possible.

              Valid syntax:

                 service exit-event [0|1]

              In general, end-users should never need to explicitly use this  option,  as  it  is  automatically
              added by the OpenVPN service wrapper when a given OpenVPN configuration is being run as a service.

              <b>exit-event</b> is the name of a Windows global event object, and OpenVPN will continuously monitor the
              state of this event object and exit when it becomes signaled.

              The second parameter indicates the initial state of <b>exit-event</b> and normally defaults to 0.

              Multiple  OpenVPN  processes can be simultaneously executed with the same <b>exit-event</b> parameter. In
              any case, the controlling process can signal <b>exit-event</b>, causing all  such  OpenVPN  processes  to
              exit.

              When  executing an OpenVPN process using the <b>--service</b> directive, OpenVPN will probably not have a
              console window  to  output  status/error  messages,  therefore  it  is  useful  to  use  <b>--log</b>  or
              <b>--log-append</b> to write these messages to a file.

       <b>--show-adapters</b>
              (Standalone)  Show available TAP-Win32 adapters which can be selected using the <b>--dev-node</b> option.
              On non-Windows systems, the <b><a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig</a></b>(8) command provides similar functionality.

       <b>--show-net</b>
              (Standalone) Show OpenVPN's view of the system routing table and network adapter list.

       <b>--show-net-up</b>
              Output OpenVPN's view of the system routing table and network adapter list to the  syslog  or  log
              file after the TUN/TAP adapter has been brought up and any routes have been added.

       <b>--show-valid-subnets</b>
              (Standalone)  Show  valid  subnets  for <b>--dev</b> <b>tun</b> emulation. Since the TAP-Win32 driver exports an
              ethernet interface to Windows, and since TUN devices are point-to-point in nature, it is necessary
              for the TAP-Win32 driver to impose certain constraints on TUN endpoint address selection.

              Namely, the point-to-point endpoints used in TUN device emulation must be the middle two addresses
              of a /30 subnet (netmask 255.255.255.252).

       <b>--tap-sleep</b> <u>n</u>
              Cause OpenVPN to sleep for <b>n</b> seconds immediately after the  TAP-Win32  adapter  state  is  set  to
              "connected".

              This  option  is  intended  to be used to troubleshoot problems with the <b>--ifconfig</b> and <b>--ip-win32</b>
              options, and is used to give the TAP-Win32 adapter time to come up before Windows  IP  Helper  API
              operations are applied to it.

       <b>--win-sys</b> <u>path</u>
              Set  the  Windows  system  directory  pathname  to use when looking for system executables such as
              <b>route.exe</b> and <b>netsh.exe</b>. By default, if this directive is not  specified,  OpenVPN  will  use  the
              SystemRoot environment variable.

              This  option  has  changed behaviour since OpenVPN 2.3. Earlier you had to define <b>--win-sys</b> <b>env</b> to
              use the SystemRoot environment variable, otherwise it defaulted to <b>C:\\WINDOWS</b>. It is  not  needed
              to  use  the  <b>env</b>  keyword any more, and it will just be ignored. A warning is logged when this is
              found in the configuration file.

       <b>--windows-driver</b> <u>drv</u>
              Specifies which tun driver to  use.  Values  are  <b>ovpn-dco</b>  (default),  <b>tap-windows6</b>  and  <b>wintun</b>.
              <b>ovpn-dco</b> and <b>wintun</b> require <b>--dev</b> <b>tun</b>. <b>wintun</b> also requires OpenVPN process to run elevated, or be
              invoked using the Interactive Service.

   <b>Standalone</b> <b>Debug</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--show-gateway</b> <u>args</u>
              (Standalone)  Show current IPv4 and IPv6 default gateway and interface towards the gateway (if the
              protocol in question is enabled).

              Valid syntax:

                 --show-gateway
                 --show-gateway IPv6-target

              For IPv6 this queries the route towards ::/128, or the specified IPv6 target address if passed  as
              argument.  For IPv4 on Linux, Windows, MacOS and BSD it looks for a 0.0.0.0/0 route.  If there are
              more  specific routes, the result will not always be matching the route of the IPv4 packets to the
              VPN gateway.

   <b>Advanced</b> <b>Expert</b> <b>Options</b>
       These are options only required when special tweaking is needed, often used when debugging or testing out
       special usage scenarios.

       <b>--hash-size</b> <u>args</u>
              Set the size of the real address hash table to <b>r</b> and the virtual address table to <b>v</b>.

              Valid syntax:

                 hash-size r v

              By default, both tables are sized at 256 buckets.

       <b>--bcast-buffers</b> <u>n</u>
              Allocate <b>n</b> buffers for broadcast datagrams (default <b>256</b>).

       <b>--persist-local-ip</b>
              Preserve initially resolved local IP address and port  number  across  <b>SIGUSR1</b>  or  <b>--ping-restart</b>
              restarts.

       <b>--persist-remote-ip</b>
              Preserve  most  recently  authenticated  remote  IP  address  and  port  number  across <b>SIGUSR1</b> or
              <b>--ping-restart</b> restarts.

       <b>--rcvbuf</b> <u>size</u>
              Set the TCP/UDP socket receive buffer size. Defaults to operating system default.

       <b>--shaper</b> <u>n</u>
              Limit bandwidth of outgoing tunnel data to <b>n</b> bytes per second on the TCP/UDP port. Note that  this
              will  only work if mode is set to <b>p2p</b>.  If you want to limit the bandwidth in both directions, use
              this option on both peers.

              OpenVPN uses the following algorithm to implement traffic shaping: Given a shaper rate of <b>n</b>  bytes
              per  second, after a datagram write of <b>b</b> bytes is queued on the TCP/UDP port, wait a minimum of <b>(b</b>
              <b>/</b> <b>n)</b> seconds before queuing the next write.

              It should be noted that OpenVPN supports multiple tunnels between the same two peers, allowing you
              to construct full-speed and reduced bandwidth tunnels at the same time, routing low-priority  data
              such  as  off-site  backups  over the reduced bandwidth tunnel, and other data over the full-speed
              tunnel.

              Also note that for low bandwidth tunnels (under 1000 bytes per second), you  should  probably  use
              lower  MTU  values  as  well  (see  above),  otherwise the packet latency will grow so large as to
              trigger timeouts in the TLS layer and TCP connections running over the tunnel.

              OpenVPN allows <b>n</b> to be between 100 bytes/sec and 100 Mbytes/sec.

       <b>--sndbuf</b> <u>size</u>
              Set the TCP/UDP socket send buffer size. Defaults to operating system default.

       <b>--tcp-queue-limit</b> <u>n</u>
              Maximum number of output packets queued before TCP (default <b>64</b>).

              When OpenVPN is tunneling data from a TUN/TAP device to a remote client over a TCP connection,  it
              is  possible  that  the TUN/TAP device might produce data at a faster rate than the TCP connection
              can support. When the number of output packets queued before sending to  the  TCP  socket  reaches
              this  limit for a given client connection, OpenVPN will start to drop outgoing packets directed at
              this client.

       <b>--txqueuelen</b> <u>n</u>
              <u>(Linux</u> <u>only)</u> Set the TX queue length on the TUN/TAP interface.  Currently  defaults  to  operating
              system default.

       <b>--disable-dco</b>
              Disables  the  opportunistic  use  of  data channel offloading if available.  Without this option,
              OpenVPN will opportunistically use DCO mode if the config options and the running kernel  supports
              using DCO.

              Data  channel  offload  currently  requires data-ciphers to only contain AEAD ciphers (AES-GCM and
              Chacha20-Poly1305) and Linux with the ovpn-dco module.

              Note that some options have no effect or cannot be used when DCO mode is enabled.

              On platforms that do not support DCO <b>disable-dco</b> has no effect.

</pre><h4><b>UNSUPPORTED</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options listed in this section have been removed from OpenVPN and are no longer supported

       <b>--client-cert-not-required</b>
              Removed in OpenVPN 2.5.  This should be replaxed with <b>--verify-client-cert</b> <b>none</b>.

       <b>--ifconfig-pool-linear</b>
              Removed in OpenVPN 2.5.  This should be replaced with <b>--topology</b> <b>p2p</b>.

       <b>--key-method</b>
              Removed in OpenVPN 2.5.  This option should not be used, as using the old <b>key-method</b>  weakens  the
              VPN  tunnel security.  The old <b>key-method</b> was also only needed when the remote side was older than
              OpenVPN 2.0.

       <b>--management-client-pf</b>
              Removed in OpenVPN 2.6.  The built-in packet filtering (pf) functionality has been removed.

       <b>--ncp-disable</b>
              Removed in OpenVPN 2.6.  This option mainly served a role as  debug  option  when  NCP  was  first
              introduced.  It should no longer be necessary.

       <b>--no-iv</b>
              Removed  in  OpenVPN  2.5.   This option should not be used as it weakens the VPN tunnel security.
              This has been a NOOP option since OpenVPN 2.4.

       <b>--no-replay</b>
              Removed in OpenVPN 2.5.  This option should not be used as it weakens the VPN tunnel security.

       <b>--ns-cert-type</b>
              Removed in OpenVPN 2.5.  The <b>nsCertType</b> field is no longer supported in recent SSL/TLS  libraries.
              If  your  certificates  does  not  include  <u>key</u>  <u>usage</u> and <u>extended</u> <u>key</u> <u>usage</u> fields, they must be
              upgraded and the <b>--remote-cert-tls</b> option should be used instead.

       <b>--prng</b> Removed in OpenVPN 2.6.  We now always use the PRNG of the SSL library.

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTION</b> <b>PROFILES</b></h4><pre>
       Client configuration files may contain multiple remote servers which it will attempt to connect  against.
       But  there  are some configuration options which are related to specific <b>--remote</b> options.  For these use
       cases, connection profiles are the solution.

       By enacpulating the <b>--remote</b> option and related options  within  <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b>  and  <b>&lt;/connection&gt;</b>,  these
       options are handled as a group.

       An  OpenVPN  client  will  try  each  connection  profile  sequentially  until  it  achieves a successful
       connection.

       <b>--remote-random</b> can be used to initially "scramble" the connection list.

       Here is an example of connection profile usage:

          client
          dev tun

          &lt;connection&gt;
          remote 198.19.34.56 1194 udp
          &lt;/connection&gt;

          &lt;connection&gt;
          remote 198.19.34.56 443 tcp
          &lt;/connection&gt;

          &lt;connection&gt;
          remote 198.19.34.56 443 tcp
          http-proxy 192.168.0.8 8080
          &lt;/connection&gt;

          &lt;connection&gt;
          remote 198.19.36.99 443 tcp
          http-proxy 192.168.0.8 8080
          &lt;/connection&gt;

          persist-key
          persist-tun
          pkcs12 client.p12
          remote-cert-tls server
          verb 3

       First we try to connect to a server at 198.19.34.56:1194 using UDP. If that fails, we then try to connect
       to 198.19.34.56:443 using TCP. If that  also  fails,  then  try  connecting  through  an  HTTP  proxy  at
       192.168.0.8:8080  to  198.19.34.56:443  using  TCP.  Finally,  try to connect through the same proxy to a
       server at 198.19.36.99:443 using TCP.

       The following OpenVPN options may be used inside of a <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> block:

       <b>bind</b>,  <b>connect-retry</b>,  <b>connect-retry-max</b>,   <b>connect-timeout</b>,   <b>explicit-exit-notify</b>,   <b>float</b>,   <b>fragment</b>,
       <b>http-proxy</b>,  <b>http-proxy-option</b>,  <b>key-direction</b>,  <b>link-mtu</b>,  <b>local</b>, <b>lport</b>, <b>mssfix</b>, <b>mtu-disc</b>, <b>nobind</b>, <b>port</b>,
       <b>proto</b>, <b>remote</b>, <b>rport</b>, <b>socks-proxy</b>, <b>tls-auth</b>, <b>tls-crypt</b>, <b>tun-mtu</b> <b>and</b>, <b>tun-mtu-extra</b>.

       A defaulting mechanism exists for specifying options to apply to all <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> profiles. If any of the
       above options (with the exception of  <b>remote</b>  )  appear  outside  of  a  <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b>  block,  but  in  a
       configuration  file  which  has  one  or  more  <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> blocks, the option setting will be used as a
       default for <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> blocks which follow it in the configuration file.

       For example, suppose the <b>nobind</b> option were placed in the sample configuration file above, near  the  top
       of  the  file, before the first <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> block. The effect would be as if <b>nobind</b> were declared in all
       <b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> blocks below it.

</pre><h4><b>INLINE</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       OpenVPN allows including files in the main configuration  for  the  <b>--ca</b>,  <b>--cert</b>,  <b>--dh</b>,  <b>--extra-certs</b>,
       <b>--key</b>,  <b>--pkcs12</b>,  <b>--secret</b>,  <b>--crl-verify</b>,  <b>--http-proxy-user-pass</b>, <b>--tls-auth</b>, <b>--auth-gen-token-secret</b>,
       <b>--peer-fingerprint</b>, <b>--tls-crypt</b>, <b>--tls-crypt-v2</b>, <b>--verify-hash</b> and <b>--auth-user-pass</b> options.

       Each inline file started by the line <b>&lt;option&gt;</b> and ended by the line <b>&lt;/option&gt;</b>

       Here is an example of an inline file usage

          &lt;cert&gt;
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          [...]
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
          &lt;/cert&gt;

       When using the inline file feature with <b>--pkcs12</b> the inline file has to be base64 encoded. Encoding of  a
       .p12 file into base64 can be done for example with OpenSSL by running <b>openssl</b> <b>base64</b> <b>-in</b> <b>input.p12</b>

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SIGHUP</b> Cause  OpenVPN  to  close  all TUN/TAP and network connections, restart, re-read the configuration
              file (if any), and reopen TUN/TAP and network connections.

       <b>SIGUSR1</b>
              Like <b>SIGHUP`</b>, except don't re-read configuration file, and possibly don't close and reopen TUN/TAP
              device, re-read key files, preserve local IP address/port, or preserve most recently authenticated
              remote  IP  address/port   based   on   <b>--persist-tun</b>,   <b>--persist-key</b>,   <b>--persist-local-ip</b>   and
              <b>--persist-remote-ip</b> options respectively (see above).

              This   signal  may  also  be  internally  generated  by  a  timeout  condition,  governed  by  the
              <b>--ping-restart</b> option.

              This signal, when combined with <b>--persist-remote-ip</b>, may be sent when the underlying parameters of
              the host's network interface change such as when the host is a DHCP client and is assigned  a  new
              IP address.  See <b>--ipchange</b> for more information.

       <b>SIGUSR2</b>
              Causes  OpenVPN  to  display  its  current  statistics (to the syslog file if <b>--daemon</b> is used, or
              stdout otherwise).

       <b>SIGINT,</b> <b>SIGTERM</b>
              Causes OpenVPN to exit gracefully.
