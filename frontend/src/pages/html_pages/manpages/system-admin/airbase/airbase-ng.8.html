       airbase-ng - multi-purpose tool aimed at attacking clients as opposed to the Access Point (AP) itself

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>airbase-ng</b> [options] &lt;interface name&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>airbase-ng</b>  is  multi-purpose tool aimed at attacking clients as opposed to the Access Point (AP) itself.
       Since it is so versatile and flexible, summarizing it is a  challenge.  Here  are  some  of  the  feature
       highlights:

       - Implements the Caffe Latte WEP client attack
       - Implements the Hirte WEP client attack
       - Ability to cause the WPA/WPA2 handshake to be captured
       - Ability to act as an ad-hoc Access Point
       - Ability to act as a full Access Point
       - Ability to filter by SSID or client MAC addresses
       - Ability to manipulate and resend packets
       - Ability to encrypt sent packets and decrypt received packets

       The main idea is of the implementation is that it should encourage clients to associate with the fake AP,
       not prevent them from accessing the real AP.

       A tap interface (atX) is created when airbase-ng is run. This can be used to receive decrypted packets or
       to send encrypted packets.

       As  real  clients will most probably send probe requests for common/configured networks, these frames are
       important for binding a client to our softAP. In this case, the AP will respond to any probe request with
       a proper probe response, which tells the client to authenticate to the airbase-ng BSSID. That being said,
       this mode could possibly disrupt the correct functionality of many APs on the same channel.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-H,</u> <u>--help</u>
              Shows the help screen.

       <u>-a</u> <u>&lt;bssid&gt;</u>
              If the BSSID is not explicitly specified by using "-a  &lt;BSSID&gt;",  then  the  current  MAC  of  the
              specified interface is used.

       <u>-i</u> <u>&lt;iface&gt;</u>
              Also capture and process from this interface in addition to the replay interface.

       <u>-w</u> <u>&lt;WEP</u> <u>key&gt;</u>
              If  WEP  should  be  used as encryption, then the parameter "-w &lt;WEP key&gt;" sets the en-/decryption
              key. This is sufficient to let airbase-ng set all the appropriate flags by itself.  If the  softAP
              operates  with  WEP  encryption, the client can choose to use open system authentication or shared
              key authentication. Both authentication  methods  are  supported  by  airbase-ng.  But  to  get  a
              keystream,  the  user  can try to force the client to use shared key authentication. "-s" forces a
              shared key auth and "-S &lt;len&gt;" sets the challenge length.

       <u>-h</u> <u>&lt;MAC&gt;</u>
              This is the source MAC for the man-in-the-middle attack. The "-M" must also be specified.

       <u>-f</u> <u>&lt;disallow&gt;</u>
              If this option is not specified, it defaults to "-f allow". This  means  the  various  client  MAC
              filters (-d and -D) define which clients to accept.

              By  using  the  "-f  disallow" option, this reverses selection and causes airbase-ng to ignore the
              clients specified by the filters.

       <u>-W</u> <u>&lt;0|1&gt;</u>
              This sets the beacon WEP flag. Remember that clients will normally only connect to APs  which  are
              the same as themselves. Meaning WEP to WEP, open to open.

              The  "auto"  option  is  to allow airbase-ng to automatically set the flag based on context of the
              other options specified. For example, if you set a WEP key with -w, then the beacon flag would  be
              set to WEP.

              One  other  use  of "auto" is to deal with clients which can automatically adjust their connection
              type. However, these are few and far between.

              In practice, it is best to set the value to the type of clients you are dealing with.

       <u>-q</u>     This suppresses printing any statistics or status information.

       <u>-v</u>     This prints additional messages and details to assist in debugging.

       <u>-M</u>     This option is not implemented yet. It is a man-in-the-middle attack between specified clients and
              BSSIDs.

       <u>-A,</u> <u>--ad-hoc</u>
              This causes airbase-ng to act as an ad-hoc client instead of a normal Access Point.

              In ad-hoc mode airbase-ng also sends beacons, but doesn't need any authentication/association.  It
              can  be activated by using "-A". The soft AP will adjust all flags needed to simulate a station in
              ad-hoc mode automatically and generate a random MAC, which is used as  CELL  MAC  instead  of  the
              BSSID.  This  can  be  overwritten by the "-a &lt;BSSID&gt;" tag. The interface MAC will then be used as
              source mac, which can be changed with "-h &lt;sourceMAC&gt;".

       <u>-Y</u> <u>&lt;in|out|both&gt;</u>
              The parameter "-Y" enables the "external processing" Mode. This creates a second interface  "atX",
              which is used to replay/modify/drop or inject packets at will. This interface must also be brought
              up with ifconfig and an external tool is needed to create a loop on that interface.

              The  packet  structure is rather simple: the ethernet header (14 bytes) is ignored and right after
              that follows the complete ieee80211 frame the same way it is going to be processed  by  airbase-ng
              (for  incoming  packets)  or  before  the  packets will be sent out of the wireless card (outgoing
              packets). This mode intercepts all data packets and loops them through  an  external  application,
              which  decides  what happens with them. The MAC and IP of the second tap interface doesn't matter,
              as real ethernet frames on this interface are dropped anyway.

              There are 3 arguments for "-Y": "in", "out" and "both", which specify the direction of  frames  to
              loop  through  the  external  application.  Obviously  "in"  redirects  only incoming (through the
              wireless NIC) frames, while outgoing frames aren't touched. "out" does the opposite, it only loops
              outgoing packets and "both" sends all both directions through the second tap interface.

              There is a small and simple example application to replay all frames on the second interface.  The
              tool  is  called  "replay.py" and is located in "./test". It's written in python, but the language
              doesn't matter. It uses pcapy to read the frames and scapy to possibly alter/show and reinject the
              frames. The tool as it is, simply replays all frames and prints a short summary  of  the  received
              frames.  The  variable  "packet"  contains  the  complete  ieee80211  packet,  which can easily be
              dissected and modified using scapy.

              This can be compared to ettercap filters, but is more powerful, as a real programming language can
              be used to build complex logic for filtering and  packet  customization.  The  downside  on  using
              python is, that it adds a delay of around 100ms and the cpu utilizations is rather large on a high
              speed network, but its perfect for a demonstration with only a few lines of code.

       <u>-c</u> <u>&lt;channel&gt;</u>
              This is used to specify the channel on which to run the Access Point.

       <u>-X,</u> <u>--hidden</u>
              This causes the Access Point to hide the SSID and to not broadcast the value.

       <u>-s</u>     When specified, this forces shared key authentication for all clients.

              The  soft  AP  will  send  an  "authentication  method  unsupported"  rejection to any open system
              authentication request if "-s" is specified.

       <u>-S</u>     It sets the shared key challenge length, which can be anything from 16 to 1480. The default is 128
              bytes. It is the number of bytes used in the random challenge. Since one tag can contain a maximum
              size of 255 bytes, any value above 255 creates several challenge tags until  all  specified  bytes
              are  written.  Many  clients  ignore values different than 128 bytes so this option may not always
              work.

       <u>-L,</u> <u>--caffe-latte</u>
              Airbase-ng also contains the new caffe-latte attack, which is also implemented in  aireplay-ng  as
              attack  "-6".  It  can  be used with "-L" or "caffe-latte". This attack specifically works against
              clients, as it waits for a broadcast arp request, which happens to be a gratuitous arp.  See  this
              for an explanation of what a gratuitous arp is. It then flips a few bits in the sender MAC and IP,
              corrects  the ICV (crc32) value and sends it back to the client, where it came from. The point why
              this attack works in practice is, that at least windows sends gratuitous arps after  a  connection
              on  layer 2 is established and a static ip is set, or dhcp fails and windows assigned an IP out of
              169.254.X.X.

              "-x &lt;pps&gt;" sets the number of packets per second to send when performing the  caffe-latte  attack.
              At the moment, this attack doesn't stop, it continuously sends arp requests. Airodump-ng is needed
              to capture the replies.

       <u>-N,</u> <u>--cfrag</u>
              This attack listens for an ARP request or IP packet from the client. Once one is received, a small
              amount  of PRGA is extracted and then used to create an ARP request packet targeted to the client.
              This ARP request is actually made of up of multiple packet fragments such that when received,  the
              client will respond.

              This  attack  works especially well against ad-hoc networks. As well it can be used against softAP
              clients and normal AP clients.

       <u>-x</u> <u>&lt;nbpps&gt;</u>
              This sets the number of packets per second that packets will be sent (default: 100).

       <u>-y</u>     When using this option, the fake AP will not respond to broadcast probes.  A  broadcast  probe  is
              where  the  specific  AP  is  not identified uniquely. Typically, most APs will respond with probe
              responses to a broadcast probe. This flag will prevent this happening. It will only  respond  when
              the specific AP is uniquely requested.

       <u>-0</u>     This  enables all WPA/WPA2/WEP Tags to be enabled in the beacons sent. It cannot be specified when
              also using -z or -Z.

       <u>-z</u> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              This specifies the WPA beacon tags. The valid values are: 1=WEP40 2=TKIP 3=WRAP 4=CCMP 5=WEP104.

       <u>-Z</u> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              same as -z, but for WPA2

       <u>-V</u> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              This specifies the valid EAPOL types. The valid values are: 1=MD5 2=SHA1 3=auto

       <u>-F</u> <u>&lt;prefix&gt;</u>
              This option causes airbase-ng to write all sent and received packets to a pcap file on disk.  This
              is the file prefix (like airodump-ng -w).

       <u>-P</u>     This causes the fake access point to respond to all probes regardless of the ESSIDs specified.

       <u>-I</u> <u>&lt;interval&gt;</u>
              This sets the time in milliseconds between each beacon.

       <u>-C</u> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              The  wildcard  ESSIDs will also be beaconed this number of seconds. A good typical value to use is
              "-C 60" (require -P).

       <u>-n</u> <u>&lt;hex&gt;</u>
              ANonce (nonce from the AP) to use  instead  of  a  randomized  one.  It  must  be  64  hexadecimal
              characters.

       <b>Filter</b> <b>options:</b>

       <u>--bssid</u> <u>&lt;MAC&gt;,</u> <u>-b</u> <u>&lt;MAC&gt;</u>
              BSSID to filter/use.

       <u>--bssids</u> <u>&lt;file&gt;,</u> <u>-B</u> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              Read a list of BSSIDs out of that file.

       <u>--client</u> <u>&lt;MAC&gt;,</u> <u>-d</u> <u>&lt;MAC&gt;</u>
              MAC of client to accept.

       <u>--clients</u> <u>&lt;file&gt;,</u> <u>-D</u> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              Read a list of client's MACs out of that file.

       <u>--essid</u> <u>&lt;ESSID&gt;,</u> <u>-e</u> <u>&lt;ESSID&gt;</u>
              Specify  a  single  ESSID.  For  SSID  containing  special  characters,  see https://www.aircrack-
              ng.org/doku.php?id=faq#how_to_use_spaces_double_quote_and_single_quote_etc_in_ap_names

       <u>--essids</u> <u>&lt;file&gt;,</u> <u>-E</u> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              Read a list of ESSIDs out of that file. It will use the same BSSID for all AP which  can  generate
              some            interesting            output            in            Airodump-ng           like:
