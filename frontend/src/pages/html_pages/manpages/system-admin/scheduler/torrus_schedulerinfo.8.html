</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       schedulerinfo - Displays extended scheduler tasks information.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>torrus</b> <b>schedulerinfo</b> --tree=<u>TREENAME</u> [<u>options...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This utility displays the extended scheduler tasks information for tree <u>TREENAME</u> on standard output. This
       might be useful for scheduler planning and analysis.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--config</b>
           Reports scheduler's configuration. The values are explained below.

           Total collector/monitor leaves: <u>N</u>
                   Total number of datasources being processed by collector or monitor daemon.

           Scheduled leaves by type
                   Torrus  supports  arbitrary  number  of  collector  types,  and  this  report  shows how many
                   datasources belong to every type. Currently the monitor leaves are not divided into types.

           Least common period: <u>N</u> seconds
                   The report below shows how the tasks are distributed across the  time  line,  and  the  least
                   common period shows the period of this time line.

           Tasks execution timeline
                   This  report  tells  which  task  and  how many datasources are involved in each task startup
                   event, and how these events are dispersed across the time.  The  column  <u>Interval</u>  shows  the
                   time interval from each task execution event to the next event on the timeline.

       <b>--runtime</b>
           Reports  scheduler's runtime statistics, such as running cycle times, late starts etc. The meaning of
           the output values is as follows. Values that have zero values are usually not printed.

           Task: <u>Name</u>, Period: <u>N</u> seconds, Offset: <u>M</u> seconds
                   Each scheduler task is characterized by its name (usually Collector or Monitor), period,  and
                   timeoffset. Fore example, if period is set to 300 seconds, and offset is 14 seconds, then the
                   task would be executed at 00:00:14, 00:05:14, 00:10:14, and so on for every hour in a day.

           <u>N</u> running cycles passed
                   How  many  times  the task was executed since last reset. The counter is normally reset after
                   <b><a href="../man8/torrus_compilexml.8.html">torrus_compilexml</a></b>(8) successfully compiles the configuration.

           <u>N</u> late starts
                   How many times the task has started with a delay from its normal schedule.

           <u>N</u> too long runs
                   How many times the task execution time was longer than its period.

           <u>N</u> overrun periods
                   How many periods have been missed because of too long executions.

           <u>N</u> missed periods
                   How many periods were missed because of any reason (such as other tasks delaying).

           Min, Max, Average, Exp Average
                   The time values are displayed in four columns: Minimum, Maximum and Average values since last
                   reset, and Exponential decay value, which may be interpreted as the average for last  several
                   values. With defaults defined in <u>torrus-config.pl</u>, 95% of the average is calculated from last
                   3 values.

           Running Time
                   How long the task executes each period.

           Late Start
                   How long the task start was delayed.

           Too Long
                   How much time the too long run took.

           RRD Queue
                   In  a multithreaded environment, the RRD files are written in a background thread. This value
                   shows the length of the RRD update queue at the beginning of each update cycle.

       <b>--help</b>
           Displays a help message.
