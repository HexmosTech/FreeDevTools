       crond - daemon to execute scheduled commands

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>crond</b> [<b>-c</b> | <b>-h</b> | <b>-i</b> | <b>-n</b> | <b>-p</b> | <b>-P</b> | <b>-s</b> | <b>-m</b><u>&lt;mail</u><b>command&gt;</b>]
       <b>crond</b> <b>-x</b> [ext,sch,proc,pars,load,misc,test,bit]
       <b>crond</b> <b>-V</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Cron</u> is automatically started at boot time.

       <u>Cron</u>  searches  <u><a href="file:/var/spool/cron/crontabs">/var/spool/cron/crontabs</a></u>  for crontab files which are named after user accounts; together
       with the system crontab <u><a href="file:/etc/crontab">/etc/crontab</a></u>, the found crontabs are loaded into the memory.  <u>Cron</u> also  searches
       for  any  files  in  the  <u><a href="file:/etc/cron.d">/etc/cron.d</a></u>  directory,  which  have a different format (see <b><a href="../man5/crontab.5.html">crontab</a></b>(5)).  <u>Cron</u>
       examines all stored crontabs and checks each job to see if it needs to be  run  in  the  current  minute.
       When  executing  commands,  any output is mailed to the owner of the crontab (or to the user specified in
       the <u>MAILTO</u> environment variable in the crontab, if such exists).  Any job output  can  also  be  sent  to
       syslog by using the <b>-s</b> option.

       There  are two ways how changes in crontables are checked.  The first method is checking the modtime of a
       file. The second method is using inotify support, which is only available on Linux.  When the daemon uses
       inotify, it logs this fact to syslog  on  startup.   The  inotify  support  checks  for  changes  in  all
       crontables and accesses the hard disk only when a change is detected.

       When using the modtime option, <u>Cron</u> checks its crontables' modtimes every minute to check for any changes
       and  reloads  the  crontables  which  have  changed.   There is no need to restart <u>Cron</u> after some of the
       crontables were modified.  The modtime option is also used when inotify can not be initialized.

       <u>Cron</u> checks these files and directories:

       <u><a href="file:/etc/crontab">/etc/crontab</a></u>
              system crontab, usually used to run daily, weekly, monthly jobs. See <b><a href="../man5/crontab.5.html">crontab</a></b>(5) for more details.

       <u><a href="file:/etc/cron.d/">/etc/cron.d/</a></u>
              directory that contains system cronjobs stored for different users.

       <u><a href="file:/var/spool/cron/crontabs">/var/spool/cron/crontabs</a></u>
              directory that contains user crontables created by the <b><a href="../man1/crontab.1.html">crontab</a></b>(1) command.

   <b>Daylight</b> <b>Saving</b> <b>Time</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>time</b> <b>changes</b>
       Local time changes of less than three hours, such as those caused by the Daylight  Saving  Time  changes,
       are  handled  in  a special way.  This only applies to jobs that run at a specific time and jobs that run
       with a granularity greater than one hour.  Jobs that run more frequently are scheduled normally.

       If time was adjusted one hour forward, those jobs that would have run  in  the  interval  that  has  been
       skipped  will  be run immediately.  Conversely, if time was adjusted backward, running the same job twice
       is avoided.

       Time changes of more than 3 hours are considered to be corrections to the clock or the timezone, and  the
       new time is used immediately.

       It is possible to use different time zones for crontables.  See <b><a href="../man5/crontab.5.html">crontab</a></b>(5) for more information.

   <b>PAM</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b>
       <u>Cron</u> supports access control with PAM if the system has PAM installed.  For more information, see <b><a href="../man8/pam.8.html">pam</a></b>(8).
       A  PAM  configuration  file  for  <u>crond</u>  is  installed  in  <u>/etc/pam.d/crond</u>.   The  daemon loads the PAM
       environment from the pam_env module.  This can  be  overridden  by  defining  specific  settings  in  the
       appropriate crontab file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Prints a help message and exits.

       <b>-i</b>     Disables inotify support.

       <b>-m</b>     This  option  allows you to specify a shell command to use for sending <u>Cron</u> mail output instead of
              using <b><a href="../man8/sendmail.8.html">sendmail</a></b>(8) This command must accept a  fully  formatted  mail  message  (with  headers)  on
              standard  input  and  send  it  as a mail message to the recipients specified in the mail headers.
              Specifying the string <u>off</u> will disable the sending of mail.

       <b>-n</b>     Tells the daemon to run in the foreground.  This can be useful when starting it out of init.  With
              this  option  is  needed  to change pam setting.  <u>/etc/pam.d/crond</u> must not enable <u>pam_loginuid.so</u>
              module.

       <b>-f</b>     the same as -n, consistent with other crond implementations.

       <b>-i</b>     Disables inotify support (if present)

       <b>-p</b>     Allows <u>Cron</u> to accept any user set crontables (read: lift owner, type and mode restrictions)

       <b>-P</b>     Don't set PATH.  PATH is instead inherited from the environment.

       <b>-c</b>     This option enables clustering support, as described below.

       <b>-s</b>     This option will direct <u>Cron</u> to send the job output to the system log using  <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3).   This  is
              useful if your system does not have <b><a href="../man8/sendmail.8.html">sendmail</a></b>(8) installed or if mail is disabled.

       <b>-x</b>     This option allows you to set debug flags.

       <b>-V</b>     Print version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>CLUSTERING</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       In  this  version of <u>Cron</u> it is possible to use a network-mounted shared <u><a href="file:/var/spool/cron">/var/spool/cron</a></u> across a cluster
       of hosts and specify that only one of the hosts should run the crontab jobs in this directory at any  one
       time.  This is done by starting <u>Cron</u> with the <b>-c</b> option, and have the <u>/var/spool/cron/.cron.hostname</u> file
       contain  just  one  line,  which  represents the hostname of whichever host in the cluster should run the
       jobs.  If this file does not exist, or the hostname in it does not match that returned by <b><a href="../man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname</a></b>(2),
       then all crontab files in this directory are ignored.  This has no effect on cron jobs specified  in  the
       <u><a href="file:/etc/crontab">/etc/crontab</a></u>  file  or  on files in the <u><a href="file:/etc/cron.d">/etc/cron.d</a></u> directory.  These files are always run and considered
       host-specific.

       Rather than editing <u>/var/spool/cron/.cron.hostname</u> directly, use the <b>-n</b> option of <b><a href="../man1/crontab.1.html">crontab</a></b>(1)  to  specify
       the host.

       You  should  ensure  that  all  hosts  in a cluster, and the file server from which they mount the shared
       crontab directory, have closely synchronised clocks, e.g., using <b><a href="../man8/ntpd.8.html">ntpd</a></b>(8), otherwise the results  will  be
       very unpredictable.

       Using  cluster  sharing  automatically disables inotify support, because inotify cannot be relied on with
       network-mounted shared file systems.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       All <b>crontab</b> files have to be regular files or symlinks to regular files, they must not be  executable  or
       writable for anyone else but the owner.  This requirement can be overridden by using the <b>-p</b> option on the
       crond  command  line.   If  inotify  support  is  in  use,  changes  in  the  symlinked  crontabs are not
       automatically noticed by the cron daemon.  The cron daemon must receive a SIGHUP  signal  to  reload  the
       crontabs.  This is a limitation of the inotify API.

       The syslog output will be used instead of mail, when sendmail is not installed.
