</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       apparmor_parser - loads AppArmor profiles into the kernel

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apparmor_parser</b> <b>[options]</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> <b>[profiles]...</b>

       <b>apparmor_parser</b> <b>[options]</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b>

       <b>apparmor_parser</b> <b>[-hv]</b> <b>[--help]</b> <b>[--version]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apparmor_parser</b> is used as a general tool to compile, and manage AppArmor policy, including loading new
       <b><a href="../man5/apparmor.d.5.html">apparmor.d</a></b>(5) profiles into the Linux kernel.

       AppArmor profiles restrict the operations available to processes.

       The <b>profiles</b> are loaded into the Linux kernel by the <b>apparmor_parser</b> program. The <b>profiles</b> may be
       specified by file name or a directory name containing a set of profiles. If a directory is specified then
       the <b>apparmor_parser</b> will try to do a profile load for each file in the directory that is not a dot file,
       or explicitly black listed (*.dpkg-new, *.dpkg-old, *.dpkg-dist, *.dpkg-bak, *.dpkg-remove, *.pacsave,
       *.pacnew, *.rpmnew, *.rpmsave, *.orig, *.rej, *~).  The <b>apparmor_parser</b> will fall back to taking input
       from standard input if a profile or directory is not supplied.

       The input supplied to <b>apparmor_parser</b> should be in the format described in <b><a href="../man5/apparmor.d.5.html">apparmor.d</a></b>(5).

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The command set is broken into four subcategories.

       unprivileged commands
           Commands that don't require any privilege and don't operate on profiles.

       unprivileged profile commands
           Commands  that  operate  on  a  profile either specified on the command line or read from stdin if no
           profile was specified.

       privileged commands
           Commands that require the MAC_ADMIN capability within the affected AppArmor namespace to load  policy
           into the kernel or filesystem write permissions to update the affected privileged files (cache etc).

       privileged profile commands
           Commands that require privilege and operate on profiles.

</pre><h4><b>Unprivileged</b> <b>commands</b></h4><pre>
       -V, --version
           Print the version number and exit.

       -h, --help
           Give a quick reference guide.

</pre><h4><b>Unprivileged</b> <b>profile</b> <b>commands</b></h4><pre>
       -N, --names
           Produce a list of policies from a given set of profiles (implies -K).

       -p, --preprocess
           Apply  preprocessing  to the input profile(s) by flattening includes into the output profile and dump
           to stdout.

       -S, --stdout
           Writes a binary (cached) profile to stdout (implies -K and -T).

       -o file, --ofile file
           Writes a binary (cached) profile to the specified file (implies -K and -T)

</pre><h4><b>Privileged</b> <b>commands</b></h4><pre>
       --purge-cache
           Unconditionally clear out cached profiles.

</pre><h4><b>Privileged</b> <b>profile</b> <b>commands</b></h4><pre>
       -a, --add
           Insert the AppArmor definitions given into the kernel. This is the  default  action.  This  gives  an
           error  message  if  a  AppArmor  definition  by the same name already exists in the kernel, or if the
           parser doesn't understand its input. It reports when an addition succeeded.

       -r, --replace
           This flag is required if an AppArmor definition by the same name already exists in the  kernel;  used
           to replace the definition already in the kernel with the definition given on standard input.

       -R, --remove
           This  flag  is  used  to  remove  an  AppArmor  definition already in the kernel.  Note that it still
           requires a complete AppArmor definition as described in <b><a href="../man5/apparmor.d.5.html">apparmor.d</a></b>(5) even though the contents of the
           definition aren't used.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -B, --binary
           Treat the profile files specified on the command line (or stdin if none specified)  as  binary  cache
           files,  produced  with  the  -S  or -o options, and load to the kernel as specified by -a, -r, and -R
           (implies -K and -T).

       -C, --Complain
           Force the profile to load in complain mode.

       -b n, --base n
           Set the base directory for resolving #include directives defined as relative paths.

       -I n, --Include n
           Add element n to the search path when resolving #include directives defined as an absolute paths.

       -f n, --apparmorfs n
           Set the location of the apparmor security filesystem (default is "<a href="file:/sys/kernel/security/apparmor">/sys/kernel/security/apparmor</a>").

       --policy-features n
           Specify the feature set that the policy was developed under.  This  does  not  override  feature  ABI
           rules.

       --override-policy-abi n
           Specify  the  feature set that the policy was developed under and override any feature ABI rules that
           the policy may be using.

       --kernel-features n
           Specify the feature set of the kernel that the policy is being compiled for. If  not  specified  this
           will be determined by the system's kernel.

       -M n, --features-file n
           Use  the  features  file  located  at  path  "n" (default is /etc/apparmor.d/cache/.features). If the
           --cache-loc option is present, the ".features" file in the specified cache directory is used.

           Note: this sets both the --kernel-features and --policy-features to be the same.

       -m n, --match-string n
           Only use match features "n".

           Note: this sets both the --kernel-features and --policy-features to be the same.

       -n n, --namespace-string n
           Force a profile to load in the namespace "n".

       -X, --readimpliesX
           In the case of profiles that are loading on systems were READ_IMPLIES_EXEC is set in the kernel for a
           given process, load the profile so that any "r" flags are processed as "mr".

       -k, --show-cache
           Report the cache processing (hit/miss details) when loading or saving cached profiles.

       -K, --skip-cache
           Perform no caching at all: disables -W, implies -T.

       -T, --skip-read-cache
           By default, if a profile's cache is found in the location specified by --cache-loc and the  timestamp
           is  newer than the profile, it will be loaded from the cache. This option disables this cache loading
           behavior.

       -W, --write-cache
           Write out cached profiles to the location specified in --cache-loc.  Off by default. In  cases  where
           abstractions have been changed, and the parser is running with "--replace", it may make sense to also
           use "--skip-read-cache" with the "--write-cache" option.

       --skip-bad-cache
           Skip updating the cache if it contains cached profiles in a bad or inconsistent state

       -L, --cache-loc
           Set  the  location(s)  of  the  cache  directory.  This  option  can accept a comma separated list of
           directories, which will be searched in order to find a matching cache. The first matching cache  file
           found is used even if a directory later in the search order may contain a newer cache file.

           If  multiple directories are specified and --write-cache has been specified then cache writes will be
           made to the first directory in the list, all other directories will be treated as read only.

           If a cache directory name needs to have a comma as part of the name, it can be specified by  using  a
           backslash to escape the comma character in the directory name.

           If not specified the cache location defaults to <a href="file:/var/cache/apparmor">/var/cache/apparmor</a>

       --print-cache-dir
           Print  the  cache  directory location. This path will be a subdirectory of the directory specified by
           --cache-loc. The subdirectory used will be influenced by the  features  available  in  the  currently
           running kernel or by the features specified with the --match-string or --features-file options.

       -Q, --skip-kernel-load
           Perform  all  actions  except  the  actual  loading of a profile into the kernel.  This is useful for
           testing profile generation, caching, etc, without making changes to the running kernel profiles.

           This also removes the need for privilege to execute the commands that manage policy in the kernel

       -q, --quiet
           Do not report on the profiles as they are loaded, and not show warnings.

       -v, --verbose
           Report on the profiles as they are loaded, and show warnings.

       --warn=n
           Enable various warnings during policy compilation. A single warn flag can  be  specified  per  --warn
           option, but the --warn flag can be passed multiple times.

             apparmor_parser --warn=rule-not-enforced ...

           A specific warning can be disabled by prepending <u>no</u>- to the flag

             apparmor_parser --warn=no-rule-not-enforced ...

           Use --help=warn to see a full list of which warn flags are supported.

       --Werror[=n]
           Convert  warnings  into  errors  during policy compilation. If the optional flag is not specified all
           warnings become errors. If the optional flag is specified only the class of warnings  specified  will
           become  errors.  A  single  flag  can  be specified per --Werror option, but the --Werror flag can be
           passed multiple times.

             apparmor_parser --Werror=deprecated ...

           Use --help=warn or --help=Werror to see a full list of which warn flags are supported.

       -d, --debug
           Given once, only checks the profiles  to  ensure  syntactic  correctness.   Given  twice,  dumps  its
           interpretation of the profile for checking.

       -D n, --dump=n
           Debug  flag  for dumping various structures and passes of policy compilation.  A single dump flag can
           be specified per --dump option, but the dump flag can be passed multiple times.  Note progress  flags
           tend to also imply the matching stats flag.

             apparmor_parser --dump=dfa-stats --dump=trans-stats &lt;file&gt;

           Use --help=dump to see a full list of which dump flags are supported

       -j n, --jobs=n
           Set the number of jobs used to compile the specified policy. Where n can be

             0    - disable jobs and use the main process for all compilation
             #    - a specific number of jobs
             auto - the # of cpus in the in the system
             x#   - # * number of cpus

           Eg.
             -j8     OR --jobs=8                   allows for 8 parallel jobs
             -jauto  OR --jobs=auto                sets the jobs to the # of cpus
             -jx4    OR --jobs=x4                  sets the jobs to # of cpus * 4
             -jx1   is equivalent to   -jauto

           The default value is the number of cpus in the system. Note that if jobs is a positive integer number
           the --jobs-max parameter is automatically set to the same value.

       --max-jobs n
           When  --jobs  is set to a scaling value (ie. auto or xN) the specify a hard cap on the value that can
           be specified by the --jobs flag.  It takes the same set of options available to  the  --jobs  option,
           and defaults to 8*cpus

       -O n, --optimize=n
           Set the optimization flags used by policy compilation.  A single optimization flag can be toggled per
           -O  option,  but  the  optimize  flag  can  be passed multiple times.  Turning off some phases of the
           optimization can make it so that policy can't complete compilation due to  size  constraints  (it  is
           entirely possible to create a dfa with millions of states that will take days or longer to compile).

           Note:  The  parser  is  set  to  use  a balanced default set of flags, that will result in reasonable
           compression but not take excessive amounts of time to complete.

           Use --help=optimize to see a full list of which optimization flags are supported.

       --abort-on-error Abort processing of profiles on the first error encountered, otherwise the parser will
       continue to try to compile other profiles if specified.
           Note: If an error is encountered while processing profiles the last error encountered will be used to
           set the exit code.

       --skip-bad-cache-rebuild The default behavior of the parser is to check if a cached version of a profile
       exists and if it does it attempt to load it into the kernel. If that load is rejected, then the parser
       will attempt to rebuild the cache file, and load again.
           This option tells the parser to not attempt to rebuild the  cache  on  failure,  instead  the  parser
           continues on with processing the remaining profiles.

       --estimated-compile-size Adjust the internal parameter used to estimate how aggressive the parser can be
       when compiling policy. This may include changes to how or when caches are dropped or how many compile
       units (jobs) are launched. The value should slightly larger than the largest Resident Set Size (RSS)
       encountered for the type of policy being compiled.
           A  value  that is too small may result in the parser exhausting system resources when compiling large
           policy. A value too large may slow policy compiles down.

           The value specified may include a suffix of <u>KB</u>, <u>MB</u>, <u>GB</u>, to make it easier to adjust the size.

           Note: config-file and command line options will override values chosen  by  tuning  affected  by  the
           option.

       --config-file
           Specify  the  config  file to use instead of /etc/apparmor/parser.conf. This option will be processed
           early before regular options regardless of the order it is specified in.

       --print-config-file
           Print the config file location that will be used.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIG</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       An optional config file <a href="file:/etc/apparmor/parser.conf">/etc/apparmor/parser.conf</a> can be used to specify  the  default  options  for  the
       parser, which then can be overridden using the command line options.

       The  config  file  ignores  leading  whitespace  and  treats lines that begin with # as comments.  Config
       options are specified one per line using the same format as the longform command  line  options  (without
       the preceding --).

       Eg.
           #comment

           optimize=no-expr-tree
           optimize=compress-fast

       As  with  the  command  line  some options accumulate and others override, ie. when there are conflicting
       versions of switch the last option is the one chosen.

       Eg.
           Optimize=no-minimize
           Optimize=minimize

       would result in Optimize=minimize being set.

       The Include, Dump, and Optimize options accumulate except for the inversion option (no-X vs.  X),  and  a
       couple  options that work by setting/clearing multiple options (compress-small).  In that case the option
       will override the flags it sets but will may accumulate with others.

       All other options override previously set values.
