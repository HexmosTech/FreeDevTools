</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       health-check - a tool to measure system events.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>health-check</b> [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Health-check  monitors  a  process and optionally their child processes and threads for a given amount of
       time.  At the end of the monitoring it will display the CPU time used, wakeup events  generated  and  I/O
       operations of the given processes.  It can be used to diagnose unhealthy badly behaving processes.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       health-check options are as follow:

       <b>-h</b>     Show help

       <b>-b</b>     Brief (terse) output for quick overview.

       <b>-c</b>     Find  and  monitor  all  child and threads of a given set of processes. This option is only useful
              when attaching to already running processes using the -p option.

       <b>-d</b>     Specify analysis duration in seconds. Default is 60 seconds.  A duration of 0  will  make  health-
              check run forever, or until the monitored process exits.

       <b>-f</b>     Follow fork, vfork and clone system calls.

       <b>-p</b> <b>pid[,pid]</b>
              Specify which processes to analyse. Can be process ID or process name.

       <b>-r</b>     Resolve IP addresses, this can take some time, hence it is an opt-in feature.

       <b>-m</b> <b>max</b> Specify  maximum  number  of  timeout  blocking system calls are logged before completing. This is
              useful with very busy processes that can generate tens of thousands of ptrace events that have  to
              be logged by health-check. The default is 1 million.

       <b>-o</b> <b>logfile</b>
              Specify  output  log file to export JSON formatted results.  The resulting data can be then easily
              imported and analysed using JSON parsing tools.

       <b>-u</b> <b>username</b>
              Run command as the specified user.  This cannot be used with the -p option.

       <b>-v</b> <b>verbose</b>
              Enable verbose mode (currently just for -W wakelock option). Not  compatible  with  the  -b  brief
              option.

       <b>-w</b>     This  uses  fnotify  to count the number of wakelock lock/unlocks. Lightweight and simple wakelock
              monitoring.

       <b>-W</b>     This does deeper system call inspection to monitor wakelock  usage  and  uses  up  more  run  time
              processing to perform the inspection.
