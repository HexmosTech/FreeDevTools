</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sv - control and manage services monitored by <b><a href="../man8/runsv.8.html">runsv</a></b>(8)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sv</b> [-v] [-w <u>sec</u>] <u>command</u> <u>services</u>

       <b><a href="file:/etc/init.d/">/etc/init.d/</a></b><u>service</u> [-w <u>sec</u>] <u>command</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sv</b>  program  reports the current status and controls the state of services monitored by the <b><a href="../man8/runsv.8.html">runsv</a></b>(8)
       supervisor.

       <u>services</u> consists of one or more arguments, each argument naming a directory <u>service</u>  used  by  <b><a href="../man8/runsv.8.html">runsv</a></b>(8).
       If  <u>service</u> doesn't start with a dot or slash and doesn't end with a slash, it is searched in the default
       services directory <u>/etc/service/</u>, otherwise relative to the current directory.

       <u>command</u> is one of up, down, status, once, pause, cont, hup, alarm, interrupt, 1, 2, term, kill, or  exit,
       or start, stop, restart, shutdown, force-stop, force-reload, force-restart, force-shutdown.

       The <b>sv</b> program can be sym-linked to <u><a href="file:/etc/init.d/">/etc/init.d/</a></u> to provide an LSB init script interface.  The <u>service</u> to
       be controlled then is specified by the base name of the ``init script''.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>status</b> Report  the current status of the service, and the appendant log service if available, to standard
              output.

       <b>up</b>     If the service is not running, start it.  If the service stops, restart it.

       <b>down</b>   If the service is running, send it the TERM signal, and the CONT signal.  If  .<a href="file:/run">/run</a>  exits,  start
              ./finish if it exists.  After it stops, do not restart service.

       <b>once</b>   If the service is not running, start it.  Do not restart it if it stops.

       <b>pause</b> <b>cont</b> <b>hup</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>quit</b> <b>1</b> <b>2</b> <b>term</b> <b>kill</b>
              If the service is running, send it the STOP, CONT, HUP, ALRM, INT, QUIT, USR1, USR2, TERM, or KILL
              signal respectively.

       <b>exit</b>   If  the  service  is  running,  send  it the TERM signal, and the CONT signal.  Do not restart the
              service.  If the service is down, and no log service exists, <b><a href="../man8/runsv.8.html">runsv</a></b>(8) exits.  If  the  service  is
              down and a log service exists, <b><a href="../man8/runsv.8.html">runsv</a></b>(8) closes the standard input of the log service and waits for
              it  to  terminate.   If the log service is down, <b><a href="../man8/runsv.8.html">runsv</a></b>(8) exits.  This command is ignored if it is
              given to an appendant log service.

       <b>sv</b> actually looks only at the first character of these <u>command</u>s.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>to</b> <b>LSB</b> <b>init</b> <b>script</b> <b>actions</b>
       <b>status</b> Same as <u>status</u>.

       <b>start</b>  Same as <u>up</u>, but wait up to 7 seconds for the command to take effect.  Then report  the  status  or
              timeout.   If  the  script  <u>./check</u>  exists in the service directory, <b>sv</b> runs this script to check
              whether the service is up and available; it's considered to be available if <u>./check</u> exits with 0.

       <b>stop</b>   Same as <u>down</u>, but wait up to 7 seconds for the service to become down.  Then report the status  or
              timeout.

       <b>reload</b> Same as <u>hup</u>, and additionally report the status afterwards.

       <b>restart</b>
              Send  the  commands <u>term</u>, <u>cont</u>, and <u>up</u> to the service, and wait up to 7 seconds for the service to
              restart.  Then report the status or  timeout.   If  the  script  <u>./check</u>  exists  in  the  service
              directory,  <b>sv</b>  runs  this  script  to  check  whether the service is up and available again; it's
              considered to be available if <u>./check</u> exits with 0.

       <b>shutdown</b>
              Same as <u>exit</u>, but wait up to 7 seconds for the <b><a href="../man8/runsv.8.html">runsv</a></b>(8) process to  terminate.   Then  report  the
              status or timeout.

       <b>force-stop</b>
              Same  as  <u>down</u>,  but wait up to 7 seconds for the service to become down.  Then report the status,
              and on timeout send the service the <u>kill</u> command.

       <b>force-reload</b>
              Send the service the <u>term</u> and <u>cont</u> commands, and wait up to 7 seconds for the service to  restart.
              Then report the status, and on timeout send the service the <u>kill</u> command.

       <b>force-restart</b>
              Send  the  service  the  <u>term</u>,  <u>cont</u>  and <u>up</u> commands, and wait up to 7 seconds for the service to
              restart.  Then report the status, and on timeout send the service the <u>kill</u> command.  If the script
              <u>./check</u> exists in the service directory, <b>sv</b> runs this script to check whether the  service  is  up
              and available again; it's considered to be available if <u>./check</u> exits with 0.

       <b>force-shutdown</b>
              Same  as  <u>exit</u>,  but  wait up to 7 seconds for the <b><a href="../man8/runsv.8.html">runsv</a></b>(8) process to terminate.  Then report the
              status, and on timeout send the service the <u>kill</u> command.

       <b>try-restart</b>
              if the service is running, send it the <u>term</u> and <u>cont</u> commands, and wait up to 7  seconds  for  the
              service to restart.  Then report the status or timeout.

   <b>Additional</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>check</b>  Check  for  the  service  to  be in the state that's been requested.  Wait up to 7 seconds for the
              service to reach the requested state, then report the status or timeout.  If the  requested  state
              of  the service is <u>up</u>, and the script <u>./check</u> exists in the service directory, <b>sv</b> runs this script
              to check whether the service is up and running; it's considered to be up if <u>./check</u> exits with 0.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v</b>     If the <u>command</u> is up, down, term, once, cont, or exit, then wait up to 7 seconds for  the  command
              to take effect.  Then report the status or timeout.

       <b>-w</b> <u>sec</u> Override the default timeout of 7 seconds with <u>sec</u> seconds.  This option implies <u>-v</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SVDIR</b>  The environment variable $SVDIR overrides the default services directory <u>/etc/service/</u>.

       <b>SVWAIT</b> The  environment  variable  $SVWAIT  overrides the default 7 seconds to wait for a command to take
              effect.  It is overridden by the -w option.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sv</b> exits 0, if the <u>command</u> was successfully sent to all <u>services</u>, and,  if  it  was  told  to  wait,  the
       <u>command</u> has taken effect to all services.

       For  each <u>service</u> that caused an error (e.g. the directory is not controlled by a <b><a href="../man8/runsv.8.html">runsv</a></b>(8) process, or <b>sv</b>
       timed out while waiting), <b>sv</b> increases the exit code by one and exits non zero.  The maximum is  99.   <b>sv</b>
       exits 100 on error.

       If  <b>sv</b> is called with a base name other than <b>sv</b>: it exits 1 on timeout or trouble sending the command; if
       the <u>command</u> is <b>status</b>, it exits 3 if the service is down, and 4 if the status is unknown; it exits  2  on
       wrong usage, and 151 on error.
