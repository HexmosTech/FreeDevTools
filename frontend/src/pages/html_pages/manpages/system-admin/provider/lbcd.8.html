           [<b>-b</b> <u>bind-address</u> [<b>-b</b> <u>bind-address</u>]] [<b>-c</b> <u>command</u>]

       <b>lbcd</b> <b>-t</b> [v2] [<u>service</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lbcd</b> runs as a daemon and reports various system utilization information and optionally service status
       information via a UDP network protocol.  It is designed to run on the client systems of a remote load
       balancing system, such as the DNS-based <b>lbnamed</b> load balancer.

       <b>lbcd</b> supports two different query protocols, version two and version three.  (Currently, <b>lbnamed</b> only
       supports version two queries.)  Either will return the current time according to that system, the time of
       the last system boot, the time the information about logged in users last changed, the load averages
       (one, five, and fifteen minute), the total and unique logged in users, whether a user is logged in on
       console, percentage full of the system <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> directory is full, and percentage full of the system <u><a href="file:/var/tmp">/var/tmp</a></u>
       directory.  (See, however, the note below about how some of this data is replaced with calculated weights
       for version two responses.)  The version three protocol can also return weight and increment information
       about a set of services.

       The service information is based around a model that returns a weight (indicating the current utilization
       of the box -- the higher, the busier) and an increment (an estimate of how much the utilization will
       increase for each additional connection directed to this box) which defaults to one.  The intent is for
       the load balancer to query the system periodically, using the returned weight as the system load, and to
       estimate the system load between queries of <b>lbcd</b> as the last returned weight plus the last returned
       increment times the number of connections directed to that system.

       By default, only one service is returned.  That default service weight is calculated as follows:

           (&lt;uniq-users&gt; * 100 + 300 * &lt;one-minute-load&gt;
               + (&lt;total-users&gt; - &lt;unique-users&gt;) * 20) * &lt;tmp-penalty&gt;

       where &lt;tmp-penalty&gt; is a multiplier applied for the most full of <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/var/tmp">/var/tmp</a></u>.  &lt;tmp-penalty&gt; will
       be 1 if both are less than 90% full and will range between 2 for 90-93% full up to 32 for 100% full.  If
       <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> or <u><a href="file:/var/tmp">/var/tmp</a></u> are completely full, the maximum possible weight will be returned.  Different algorithms
       for determining the weight can be used instead; see the <b>-w</b> option.

       If you want to use a simple load average instead, pass the <b>-S</b> option to <b>lbcd</b> and then the load service
       will use only the one-minute load.  If you want every system running <b>lbcd</b> to return the same load, use
       the <b>-R</b> option.

       If the file <u>/etc/nolbcd</u> exists, <b>lbcd</b> will force the weight of the default service to the maximum value
       regardless of the normal service calculation.  This allows one to effectively remove a host from a load-
       balanced pool by touching a file without having to stop the <b>lbcd</b> daemon.

       Since <b>lbnamed</b> calculates the weight from the one minute load and the number of logged-in users and
       currently only supports version two, <b>lbcd</b> will replace the one-minute load with the weight of the primary
       service when responding to a version two query and will set all of the user numbers to zero unless <b>-S</b> was
       given.  If <b>-S</b> was given, the values returned will be left alone.  (This means that <b>-S</b> will override <b>-R</b>
       for version two queries, since <b>-R</b> is equivalent to specifying a service of "rr".)

       <b>lbcd</b> responds to any UDP packets on port 4330 (or the port given with the <b>-p</b> option).  It has no built-in
       security, so if you do not want to disclose the above information to random systems on the Internet, you
       will want to limit access to this port using iptables, firewall rules, or other similar measures.

       By default, <b>lbcd</b> listens on all addresses and responds on whatever address the kernel picks for outgoing
       packets.  <b>lbnamed</b> sends out all of its packets and then waits for replies and uses the source address of
       the reply packet to associate that reply with one of the queried hosts.  This means that if <b>lbnamed</b> is
       not configured to query the same address as the kernel picks for <b>lbcd</b> to respond on, the response may be
       ignored and the host considered down.  To work around this, use the <b>-b</b> flag on hosts with multiple
       interfaces to ensure that replies go out on the interface being queried.  If a host has multiple IP
       addresses that will be queried, run multiple instances of <b>lbcd</b>, one for each interface.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b> <u>allowed-service</u>
           The  version 3 lbcd protocol allows the client to request weight information for a specific protocol.
           To prevent clients from getting information about (and causing <b>lbcd</b> to probe) services that shouldn't
           be exposed over protocol, only services specified with the <b>-a</b> option are allowed.  This option may be
           given multiple times to allow multiple services to be queried.  The service  specified  with  <b>-w</b>,  if
           any, is always allowed, as is the "default" service.

           For  a  list of the supported services, and therefore the allowed values for <u>allowed-service</u>, see the
           <b>-w</b> option.

           Client  queries  are  compared  exactly  against  the  <u>allowed-service</u>  values,  including  any  port
           information  after  a colon, so all service values that should be queryable must be listed using this
           option.

       <b>-b</b> <u>bind-address</u>
           By default, <b>lbcd</b> binds to all available addresses.  If this option is given, <b>lbcd</b> binds only  to  the
           specified  address  and  will  only  answer  UDP  queries  to that address.  This option may be given
           multiple times to bind to multiple addresses.  <u>bind-address</u> must be an IP  address  (either  IPv4  or
           IPv6), not a hostname.

           This  option  is  ignored  if  <b>lbcd</b>  is passed already open sockets via the systemd socket activation
           protocol.  In that case, the bind addresses of the sockets  should  be  controlled  via  the  systemd
           configuration.

       <b>-c</b> <u>command</u>
           Obtain the service weight and increment by running an external command.  This command should print to
           standard  output  one line containing two integer numbers, separated by whitespace.  The first number
           is taken to be the weight and the second number is taken to be the increment.  (As  mentioned  above,
           when  responding  to  version  two  protocol  queries,  the weight is returned as the one-minute load
           average.)

       <b>-d</b>  Run in the foreground (the same as with <b>-f</b>), send informational messages to standard  output  instead
           of syslog, and send errors to standard error instead of syslog.  This is intended for debugging.

       <b>-f</b>  Run  in  the  foreground,  meaning  don't  fork and don't detach from the controlling terminal.  This
           allows <b>lbcd</b> to be run more simply via modern init  systems  such  as  upstart  or  systemd  and  work
           properly with process supervisors such as daemontools or runit.

       <b>-h</b>  Print out usage information and exit.

       <b>-l</b>  Log  every  received request to syslog (or to standard output if <b>-d</b> was given).  The requests will be
           logged with the LOG_DAEMON facility and the LOG_INFO priority.

       <b>-P</b> <u>file</u>
           Store the PID of the running daemon in <u>file</u>.  <u>file</u> will be deleted when <b>lbcd</b> exits  normally  (via  a
           SIGTERM or SIGINT signal).

       <b>-p</b> <u>port</u>
           Listen on <u>port</u> rather than the default of 4330.

           This  option  is  ignored  if  <b>lbcd</b>  is passed already open sockets via the systemd socket activation
           protocol.  In that case, the listening port should be controlled via the systemd configuration.

       <b>-R</b>  Use round-robin as the service.  This will always return a weight of one and an increment of one.  It
           is equivalent to "-w rr".  For version two responses, it will always return a one-minute load of  one
           regardless of the actual load average of the system (unless <b>-S</b> is used).

       <b>-S</b>  When  answering version two queries, do not attempt to adjust for <b>lbnamed</b>'s logic and force it to use
           the service weight.  Instead, report the load averages and number  of  logged  in  users  accurately.
           This  means  that version two responses will not contain any information derived from custom services
           or weight settings and the <b>-c</b>, <b>-w</b>, and <b>-R</b> options will be ignored for version two responses.

       <b>-T</b> <u>seconds</u>
           Use a timeout of <u>seconds</u> when doing service probes  (including  running  a  command  with  <b>-c</b>).   The
           default is five seconds.

       <b>-t</b>  Test  mode.  When run with the <b>-t</b> flag, <b>lbcd</b> will do all the checks that it would do when receiving a
           query packet, print out the results in a human-readable format to standard output, and then exit.

           When run with this option, the remaining command-line arguments are taken as services to probe.   The
           valid service names are the same as the valid service arguments to the <b>-w</b> option, with one exception.
           If  the  first  service is the string "v2", <b>lbcd</b> will behave as if it received a protocol version two
           query packet and will manipulate its reply information accordingly before printing it out.

       <b>-w</b> <u>weight</u>
           Specify either a service to probe or a weight and increment to always return.  <u>weight</u> can be a string
           of the form <u>weight</u>:<u>increment</u> where both <u>weight</u> and <u>increment</u> are numbers, in which case  that  weight
           and increment will always be returned.  Alternately, it can be the name of a service module, in which
           case  that service will be probed and its weight will be returned as the service weight (and the one-
           minute load with version two queries).

           The currently supported services are "load" (the default),  "ftp",  "http",  "imap",  "nntp",  "ntp",
           "pop",  "smtp", "tcp", and "rr" (round-robin, the same as <b>-R</b>).  The "http" and "tcp" services must be
           followed by a colon and a port number.

           This option only affects the default service.  A version 3 protocol  client  can  query  any  of  the
           supported  services  provided  that the service is listed as allowed, using the <b>-a</b> flag.  This allows
           the client to get weight and increment information for several different services.

       <b>-Z</b>  When <b>lbcd</b> has set up its network socket and is ready to answer requests, raise SIGSTOP.  This signals
           to upstart, when using "expect stop", that the daemon is ready to  accept  connections,  and  upstart
           will raise SIGCONT to allow <b>lbcd</b> to continue.  This option is probably only useful when using upstart
           as the init system.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Run <b>lbcd</b> as a daemon, using the default load service, and writing a PID file to <u>/var/run/lbcd.pid</u>:

           lbcd -P /var/run/lbcd.pid

       Run  <b>lbcd</b>  in  the foreground, and log all client requests via syslog.  This is a typical invocation with
       systemd, using socket activation.

           lbcd -f -l

       The same, but raise SIGSTOP after <b>lbcd</b> is ready to answer queries.  This is  a  typical  invocation  with
       upstart.

           lbcd -f -l -Z

       Run  <b>lbcd</b>  as  a  daemon,  with  default behavior, but use round-robin as the default service.  This will
       equally balance queries across machines instead of trying to be sensitive to load.

           lbcd -R

       Determine the weight of the system based on whether the local HTTP port is responding.  If it isn't,  the
       system will return the maximum weight, which will cause it to drop out of the pool.

           lbcd -w http:80

       Run the external program <u>/usr/bin/lb-slapd</u> to determine the weight.

           lbcd -c /usr/bin/ldap-check

       This  program  should print, to standard output, two numbers separated by a space.  The first will be the
       weight and the second will be the load.  In this case, it does a query against a  local  LDAP  search  to
       determine its health.  (A good approach for LDAP slaves would be to check the syncrepl data to see if the
       slave is up-to-date.)

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       LISTEN_FDS
       LISTEN_PID
           If these environment variables are set, <b>lbcd</b> will expect to be provided its listening sockets via the
           systemd socket activation protocol and will not attempt to bind its own sockets.  For more details on
           the protocol, see <u><a href="../man7/daemon.7.html">daemon</a></u>(7) and <u><a href="../man3/sd_listen_fds.3.html">sd_listen_fds</a></u>(3).

       NOTIFY_SOCKET
           If  this  environment  variable is set, <b>lbcd</b> will notify the socket named in this variable when it is
           ready to accept incoming packets using the systemd status notification protocol.  For  more  details,
           see <u><a href="../man7/daemon.7.html">daemon</a></u>(7) and <u><a href="../man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify</a></u>(3).

           Note  that using socket activation is recommended when running under systemd, and status notification
           is not necessary or useful when using socket activation.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/nolbcd</u>
           If this file exists, <b>lbcd</b> will force the weight of the default service to the maximum possible  value
           regardless  of  the  normal  weight calculation.  This allows one to effectively remove a host from a
           load-balanced pool by touching a file without having to stop the <b>lbcd</b> daemon.

       <u>/etc/nologin</u>
           If this file exists, <b>lbcd</b> will force the weight returned by the default load algorithm to the maximum
           possible value.  This will only apply if the default load algorithm is used; if a different algorithm
           is used, due to <b>-R</b> or <b>-w</b>, no change to the returned weight will be made.
