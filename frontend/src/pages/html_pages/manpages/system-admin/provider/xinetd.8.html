</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xinetd - the extended Internet services daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xinetd</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xinetd</b>  performs  the same function as <b>inetd</b>: it starts programs that provide Internet services.  Instead
       of having such servers started at system initialization time, and be dormant until a  connection  request
       arrives,  <b>xinetd</b>  is the only daemon process started and it listens on all service ports for the services
       listed in its configuration file. When a request comes in, <b>xinetd</b> starts the appropriate server.  Because
       of the way it operates, <b>xinetd</b> (as well as <b>inetd</b>) is also referred to as a super-server.

       The services listed in <b>xinetd</b>'s configuration file can be separated into two  groups.   Services  in  the
       first  group  are called <u>multi-threaded</u> and they require the forking of a new server process for each new
       connection request.  The new server then handles  that  connection.   For  such  services,  <b>xinetd</b>  keeps
       listening  for  new  requests  so  that  it  can  spawn new servers.  On the other hand, the second group
       includes services for which the service daemon is responsible for handling all new  connection  requests.
       Such  services  are  called <u>single-threaded</u> and <b>xinetd</b> will stop handling new requests for them until the
       server dies.  Services in this group are usually datagram-based.

       So far, the only reason for the existence of a super-server was to conserve system resources by  avoiding
       to  fork  a  lot  of  processes which might be dormant for most of their lifetime.  While fulfilling this
       function, <b>xinetd</b> takes advantage of the idea of a super-server to provide features such as access control
       and logging.  Furthermore, <b>xinetd</b> is not limited to services listed in <u>/etc/services.</u>  Therefore, anybody
       can use <b>xinetd</b> to start special-purpose servers.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b>     Enables debug mode. This produces a lot of debugging output, and it makes it  possible  to  use  a
              debugger on <b>xinetd</b>.

       <b>-syslog</b> <u>syslog_facility</u>
              This  option  enables  syslog  logging  of  <b>xinetd</b>-produced  messages  using  the specified syslog
              facility.  The following facility names are  supported:  <u>daemon,</u>  <u>auth,</u>  <u>user,</u>  <u>local[0-7]</u>  (check
              <u><a href="../man5/syslog.conf.5.html">syslog.conf</a>(5)</u>  for  their meanings).  This option is ineffective in debug mode since all relevant
              messages are sent to the terminal.

       <b>-filelog</b> <u>logfile</u>
              <b>xinetd</b>-produced messages will be placed in the specified file.  Messages are  always  appended  to
              the  file.   If  the file does not exist, it will be created.  This option is ineffective in debug
              mode since all relevant messages are sent to the terminal.

       <b>-f</b> <u>config_file</u>
              Determines the file that <b>xinetd</b> uses for configuration. The default is <u>/etc/xinetd.conf</u>.

       <b>-pidfile</b> pid_file
              The process ID is written to the file. This option is ineffective in debug mode.

       <b>-dontfork</b>
              Tells xinetd to stay in the foreground rather than detaching itself, to  support  being  run  from
              init or daemontools. This option automatically sets <b>-stayalive</b> (see below).

       <b>-stayalive</b>
              Tells xinetd to stay running even if no services are specified.

       <b>-limit</b> <u>proc_limit</u>
              This  option places a limit on the number of concurrently running processes that can be started by
              <b>xinetd.</b>  Its purpose is to prevent process table overflows.

       <b>-logprocs</b> <u>limit</u>
              This option places a limit on the  number  of  concurrently  running  servers  for  remote  userid
              acquisition.

       <b>-version</b>
              This option causes xinetd to print out its version information.

       <b>-inetd_compat</b>
              This option causes xinetd to read /etc/inetd.conf in addition to the standard xinetd config files.
              /etc/inetd.conf is read after the standard xinetd config files.

       <b>-cc</b> <u>interval</u>
              This  option  instructs  <b>xinetd</b> to perform periodic consistency checks on its internal state every
              <u>interval</u> seconds.

       The <u>syslog</u> and <u>filelog</u> options are mutually exclusive.  If none is specified, the default is syslog using
       the <u>daemon</u> facility.  You should not confuse <b>xinetd</b> messages with messages related  to  service  logging.
       The latter are logged only if this is specified via the configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>XINETD</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xinetd</b>  performs  certain  actions  when  it  receives  certain signals.  The actions associated with the
       specific signals can be redefined by editing <u>config.h</u> and recompiling.

       <b>SIGHUP</b>         causes a hard reconfiguration, which means that <b>xinetd</b> re-reads the configuration file and
                      terminates the servers for services that  are  no  longer  available.  Access  control  is
                      performed  again  on  running  servers  by  checking the remote location, access times and
                      server instances. If the number of server instances is lowered,  some  arbitrarily  picked
                      servers  will  be  killed  to  satisfy  the  limit; this will happen <u>after</u> any servers are
                      terminated because of failing the remote location or access time  checks.   Also,  if  the
                      <b>INTERCEPT</b>  flag  was  clear  and  is  set,  any  running  servers for that service will be
                      terminated; <u>the</u> <u>purpose</u> <u>of</u> <u>this</u> <u>is</u> <u>to</u> <u>ensure</u> <u>that</u> <u>after</u> <u>a</u> <u>hard</u> <u>reconfiguration</u> <u>there</u>  <u>will</u>
                      <u>be</u>  <u>no</u>  <u>running</u> <u>servers</u> <u>that</u> <u>can</u> <u>accept</u> <u>packets</u> <u>from</u> <u>addresses</u> <u>that</u> <u>do</u> <u>not</u> <u>meet</u> <u>the</u> <u>access</u>
                      <u>control</u> <u>criteria</u>.

       <b>SIGQUIT</b>        causes program termination.

       <b>SIGTERM</b>        terminates all running servers before terminating <b>xinetd</b>.

       <b>SIGUSR1</b>        causes an internal state dump (the default dump file is  <u>/var/run/xinetd.dump</u>;  to  change
                      the filename, edit <u>config.h</u> and recompile).

       <b>SIGABRT</b>        causes  an  internal  consistency  check  to  verify  that the data structures used by the
                      program have not been corrupted.  When the check  is  completed  <b>xinetd</b>  will  generate  a
                      message that says if the check was successful or not.

       On reconfiguration the log files are closed and reopened. This allows removal of old log files.
