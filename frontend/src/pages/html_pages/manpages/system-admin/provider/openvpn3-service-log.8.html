</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       openvpn3-service-log - OpenVPN 3 Linux - Internal Log Service

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>openvpn3-service-log</b> <b>[OPTIONS]</b>
       <b>openvpn3-service-log</b> <b>-h</b> | <b>--help</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  can  run in two modes; as a stand-alone program without any services enabled or as a D-Bus
       service.  By default the <b>openvpn3-service-log</b> process will be started automatically as  a  D-Bus  service
       when  any of the OpenVPN 3 Linux service backends wants to send log events.  The auto-start is handled by
       the <b>dbus-daemon</b> via the <u>net.openvpn.v3.log.service</u> configuration file.

       When run as a stand-alone program, it is limited in what kind of log events it will receive.   The  other
       backend services need to use the <b>--signal-broadcast</b> option for this program to pick up log events as they
       occur.   The  drawback  of  this  approach  is that everyone on the system, may listen to the various log
       signals happening.  This operational mode is therefore more useful when debugging the various  OpenVPN  3
       Linux services or it is believed to be an issue with the related D-Bus policies.

       If  run  as  a  D-Bus  service,  each  of the various backend services will attach themselves to this log
       service before starting to send log events.  This has a higher security profile and restricts  log  event
       access to only this program.

       The  default  behaviour  is  to print log events to the terminal, unless otherwise configured via options
       provided during the start-up.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print  usage and help details to the terminal

       <b>--version</b>
              Prints the version of the program and exists

       <b>--timestamp</b>
              This enables printing timestamps to the log output.  This is mostly useful when sending  log  data
              to  file or terminal.  When using other system log services (such as syslog), timestamps are often
              added by those log services instead.

       <b>--colour</b>
              When logging to terminal or file, this adds ANSI colour escape codes to  the  log  data,  to  more
              easily  separate  various  log  events  from each other.  Log event colours are grouped by the log
              level of the log event.

       <b>--log-level</b> <u>LEVEL</u>
              Sets the system wide log verbosity for the log events being  logged  to  file  or  any  other  log
              destination  <b>openvpn3-service-log</b>  is  configured  to  use.   Valid values are <u>0</u> to <u>6</u>.  The higher
              value, the more verbose the log events will be.  Log level <u>6</u> will retrieve all debug events.

              Sets the system wide log verbosity  for  log  events  being  logged  to  file  or  any  other  log
              destination  <b>openvpn3-service-log</b>  is configured to use.  The default is <b>3</b>.  Valid values are <b>0</b> to
              <b>6</b>.  Higher log levels results in more verbose logs and log level <b>6</b>  will  contain  all  debug  log
              events.   This  log-level can setting can be modified at runtime via <b>openvpn3-admin</b> <b>log-service</b> if
              running with <b>--service</b>.

       <b>--log-file</b> <u>FILE</u>
              This will write all log events to <u>FILE</u> instead of the terminal.

       <b>--journald</b>
              This will make all log events be sent to the <a href="../man8/systemd-journald.8.html">systemd-journald</a>(8) log service.  This approach  will
              add  additional  meta  data to the journal log to each log event.  Additional journal fields added
              are prefixed  with  <b>O3_</b>.   Examples  of  such  fields  are:  <b>O3_LOGTAG</b>,  <b>O3_SENDER</b>,  <b>O3_INTERFACE</b>,
              <b>O3_OBJECT_PATH</b>, <b>O3_LOG_GROUP</b> and <b>O3_LOG_CATEGORY</b>.

              To view this information, use the <b>--output-fields=</b> option to <b><a href="../man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a></b>(1).

              Example:

                 # journalctl --output-fields=O3_LOGTAG,O3_OBJECT_PATH,O3_INTERFACE \
                       O3_LOG_GROUP,MESSAGE -o verbose

       <b>--no-logtag-prefix</b>
              This  option  is  only effective together with <b>--journald</b>.  The default is to prefix each log line
              (<b>MESSAGE=</b>)  with  a  tag  value   unique   to   the   sender   (see   <b>openvpn3-admin</b>   <b>log-service</b>
              <b>--list-subscriptions</b>).  With jorunald logging, this log tag is already preserved as a journal meta
              filed  (<b>O3_LOGTAG</b>).   By enabling this option, this log tag prefixing to the log message line will
              not happen.

       <b>--syslog</b>
              This will make all log events be sent to the generic system logger via the <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3) function.

       <b>--syslog-facility</b> <u>LOG-FACILITY</u>
              To be used together with --syslog.  The default  <u>LOG-FACILITY</u>  is  <u>LOG_DAEMON</u>.   For  other  valid
              facilities, see the <u>facility</u> section in <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3).

       <b>--service-log-dbus-details</b>
              Each  log  event  contains  some  more detailed meta-data of the sender of the log event.  This is
              disabled by default, but when enabled it will add a line on the log  destination  before  the  log
              event  itself  with this meta-data.  This is mostly only useful when debugging and not recommended
              for normal production.

       <b>--idle-exit</b> <u>MINUTES</u>
              The <b>openvpn3-service-log</b> service will exit automatically if it is being idle for <u>MINUTES</u>  minutes.
              By being idle, it means no other services have attached their log streams to this service.  To see
              how many log subscriptions are attached, see the output of <b>openvpn3</b> <b>log-service</b>.

       <b>--state-dir</b> <u>DIRECTORY</u>
              When  this  option  is  given,  it  will  save  the current runtime settings in a file inside this
              directory.  This is used to preserve the log settings across process restarts, for example if  the
              <b>--idle-exit</b>  kicks  in  or  the host is rebooted.  The contents of this file is not expected to be
              modified directly but rather use the <b>openvpn3-admin</b> <b>log-service</b> as the configuration tool.
