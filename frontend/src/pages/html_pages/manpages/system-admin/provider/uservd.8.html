</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       uservd — supply user services

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>userv</b> [<b>-daemon</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>uservd</b>  is  the  daemon called by <b>userv</b> to have a task performed under different userid while maintaining
       limited trust between caller and callee.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There is one optional argument:

       <b>-daemon</b>     Requests that the program daemonise.   If  this  flag  is  supplied,  <b>uservd</b>  will  fork  and
                   completely detach from the controlling terminal.  If this option is not supplied, <b>uservd</b> will
                   remain  in  its starting process group and continue to use the supplied stderr stream for any
                   runtime system messages; this is useful for running  <b>uservd</b>  as  a  child  of  <b>init</b>.   Errors
                   detected by <b>uservd</b> itself will be reported via <b>syslog</b> in either case.

</pre><h4><b>SYSLOG</b> <b>MESSAGES:</b></h4><pre>
       <b>uservd</b>  issues  diagnostics of various kinds to syslog, with facility <b>LOG_DAEMON</b>.  The syslog levels used
       are:

       <b>debug</b>       Verbose messages about the activity of the userv daemon.

       <b>info</b>        Two log messages about the nature and outcome of each request.

       <b>notice</b>      Messages about the status of the daemon, including the startup message and the hourly  socket
                   check messages.

       <b>warning</b>     If the uservd exits because it believes that it no longer controls the rendezvous socket (ie,
                   its  socket  has become orphaned), this level will receive messages indicating why the daemon
                   believes this and notifying of its shutdown.

       <b>err</b>         A believed-recoverable error condition was detected by the userv server in itself, the client
                   or the operating system (this includes resource shortages). The uservd will try to continue.

       <b>crit</b>        The uservd detected a non-recoverable error condition after startup and will exit.

       <b>alert</b>       not used.

       <b>emerg</b>       not used.

       The service configuration language has the facility to direct error and warning messages to syslog.   The
       default facility and level is <b>user.err</b>, but the author of the configuration file(s) can override this.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The daemon's exit code will reflect how well things went:

       <b>0</b>           The  daemon was asked to detach itself from the controlling terminal and this appears to have
                   been done successfully.

       <b>1*</b>          The daemon got a SIGTERM or SIGINT and shut itself down.

       <b>2*</b>          The daemon believed that it was no longer the uservd and so exited to clean up.

       <b>3</b>           uservd was started with incorrect arguments.

       <b>4</b>           A system call failure or other environmental problem occurred during startup.

       <b>5*</b>          There was a non-recoverable error after startup; the uservd had to exit.

       <b>6</b>           The daemon was asked to detach itself, but its  detaching  child  died  for  some  unexpected
                   reason.

       <b>SIGABRT/SIGIOT*</b>
                   An  unexpected  internal error, usually caused by a bug in uservd.  This can also occur if an
                   attempt to block signals using sigprocmask fails.

       Outcomes marked * are not possible if the daemon is asked to detach itself - these exit statuses will  be
       reaped by init instead and so will not usually be logged anywhere.

       The  daemon's  per-request  children  will  report  the success or otherwise of its request in their exit
       status.  These are not usually be logged unless they indicate a serious problem.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       All of the environment variables passed to <b>uservd</b> will be inherited by services as part  of  the  default
       environment.   (If  the  <b>set-environment</b> configuration directive is used, then other system configuration
       files can modify the environment.  Consult the specification.)
