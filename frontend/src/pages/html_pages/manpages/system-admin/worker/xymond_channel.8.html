</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xymond_channel - Feed a xymond channel to a worker module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xymond_channel</b> <b>--channel=CHANNEL</b> <b>[options]</b> <b>workerprogram</b> <b>[worker-options]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       xymond_channel  hooks  into one of the <u><a href="../man8/xymond.8.html">xymond</a>(8)</u> channels that provide information about events occurring
       in the Xymon system.  It  retrieves  messages  from  the  xymond  daemon,  and  passes  them  on  to  the
       <b>workerprogram</b>  on  the  STDIN (file descripter 1) of the worker program.  Worker programs can then handle
       messages as they like.

       A number of  worker  programs  are  shipped  with  xymond,  e.g.   <u><a href="../man8/xymond_filestore.8.html">xymond_filestore</a>(8)</u>  <u><a href="../man8/xymond_history.8.html">xymond_history</a>(8)</u>
       <u><a href="../man8/xymond_alert.8.html">xymond_alert</a>(8)</u> <u><a href="../man8/xymond_rrd.8.html">xymond_rrd</a>(8)</u>

       If  you  want  to  write your own worker module, a sample worker module is provided as part of the xymond
       distribution in the xymond_sample.c file. This illustrates how to easily fetch and parse messages.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       xymond_channel accepts a few options.

       --channel=CHANNELNAME
              Specifies the channel to receive messages from, only one channel can  be  used.   This  option  is
              required. The following channels are available:
              "status" receives all Xymon status- and summary-messages
              "stachg" receives information about status changes
              "page" receives information about statuses triggering alerts
              "data" receives all Xymon "data" messages
              "notes" receives all Xymon "notes" messages
              "enadis" receives information about hosts being disabled or enabled.

       --filter=EXPRESSION
              EXPRESSION  is  a  Perl-compatible regular expression. xymond_channel will match the first line of
              each message against this expression, and silently drops any  message  that  does  not  match  the
              expression. Especially useful for custom worker modules and during testing, to limit the amount of
              data that the module must process.
              Note   that  messages  for  "logrotate",  "shutdown",  "drophost",  "renamehost",  "droptest"  and
              "renametest" are always forwarded by xymond_channel, whether they match the filter or not.

       --msgtimeout=TIMEOUT
              Modify the default timeout (30 seconds) for the worker module to handle a message.  If  a  message
              is  not  handled  within this time, it is considered lost. You normally do not have to modify this
              unless you have an extremely busy server.

       --daemon
              xymond_channel is normally started by <u><a href="../man8/xymonlaunch.8.html">xymonlaunch</a>(8)</u> as a task defined in the  <u><a href="../man5/tasks.cfg.5.html">tasks.cfg</a>(5)</u>  file.
              If  you  are not using xymonlaunch, then starting xymond_channel with this option causes it to run
              as a stand-alone background task.

       --pidfile=FILENAME
              If running as a stand-alone daemon, xymond_channel will save  the  process-ID  of  the  daemon  in
              FILENAME. This is useful for automated startup- and shutdown- scripts.

       --env=FILENAME
              Loads  the  environment  variables  defined  in  FILENAME before starting xymond_channel.  This is
              normally used only when  running  as  a  stand-alone  daemon;  if  xymond_channel  is  started  by
              xymonlaunch, then the environment is controlled by the task definition in the <u><a href="../man5/tasks.cfg.5.html">tasks.cfg</a>(5)</u> file.

       --log=FILENAME
              Redirect output to this log-file.

       --md5 / --no-md5
              Enable/disable  checksumming of messages passed from xymond_channel to the worker module. This may
              be useful if you suspect that data may be corrupted, e.g. when sent to  a  remote  worker  module.
              Note  that  enabling  this  may  break  communication  with  old versions of Xymon worker modules.
              Default: Disabled.

       --debug
              Enable debugging output.
