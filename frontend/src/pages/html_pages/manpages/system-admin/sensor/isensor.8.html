       ipmiutil_sensor - show Sensor Data Records

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ipmiutil</b> <b>sensor</b> <b>[-abcdefgjkmpqrstuvwxL</b> <b>-i</b> <b>id</b> <b>-n</b> <b>snum</b> <b>-h</b> <b>tval</b> <b>-l</b> <b>tval</b> <b>-NUPREFJTVYZ]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>ipmiutil</u>  <u>sensor</u>  is a program that uses IPMI commands to show and decode Sensor Data Records and current
       sensor readings for all sensors in the system.  This utility can use either the  /dev/ipmi0  driver  from
       OpenIPMI, the /dev/imb driver from Intel, the /dev/ipmikcs driver from valinux, direct user-space IOs, or
       the IPMI LAN interface if -N.

       Note  that  this  utility  by  default  only  displays Sensor Data Records reported by from the Baseboard
       Management Controller.  To show sensors for other controllers, see options -b and -m below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command line options are described below.

       -a snum
              ReArms the sensor number for events

       -b     Shows SDRs for Bladed (PICMG or ATCA) systems by traversing the child MCs (same as -e).

       -c     Show sensor list in a simpler/Canonical format without  uninterpreted  binary  values.   Only  the
              user-friendly interpreted sensor information is shown.  (same as -s).

       -d &lt;file&gt;
              Dump  the SDRs to a specified binary file.  This file can be used with -j to jumpstart getting the
              sensor readings.

       -e     Show Every SDR in a bladed system by traversing the child MCs (same as -b).

       -f &lt;file&gt;
              Restore the SDRs from the specified binary File.  This is normally  only  done  with  the  initial
              factory provisioning.

       -g sens_type
              Shows  only  those  SDRs matching the given sensor type group.  The sens_type string can be "fan",
              "temp", "voltage", or any string or substring matching those in the IPMI 2.0 Table 42-3 for Sensor
              Types.  Multiple types can be listed, separated by a comma (,) but no spaces.

       -h tval
              Highest threshold value to set for the specified sensor.  This tval can be in decimal, or  of  the
              form  0x1a,  to match the raw reading value shown by sensor following the " = ".  The value passed
              is set as the non-critical threshold value, with the more critical ones  set  by  the  utility  as
              incrementally  lower.   This simplifies the interface and ensures that the threshold values do not
              get out of order.  This requires specifying the sensor number via -n.

       -i ID  Show or set only the sensor Index corresponding to ID, where ID is the hex ID of the SDR as  shown
              in  the sensor output under "_ID_".  The ID argument can be one hex number (e.g. 0x0e or 0e), or a
              range of hex numbers (e.g. 0e-1a or 1a,2a or 0x0e-0x2a).  This is useful to repeatedly view just a
              few sensor readings for changes, or to set just one sensor quickly  without  reading  all  of  the
              SDRs.

       -j file
              Jump-start  by  caching  the  SDRs from a file.  This uses an SDR binary file to read the SDRs, so
              that only the sensor readings need to be read from the firmware.   This  avoids  getting  the  SDR
              reservation and reading each SDR, so it makes getting the sensor readings more efficient.  The SDR
              binary  file  can  be  created  using  the -d option to dump the SDRs to a file, or -j will try to
              create the file if not there.

       -k K   When looping with -L, wait K seconds between loops.  Default is 1 second.

       -l tval
              Lowest threshold value to set for the specified sensor.  This tval can be in decimal,  or  of  the
              form  0x1a,  to match the raw reading value shown by sensor following the " = ".  The value passed
              is set as the non-critical threshold value, with the more critical ones  set  by  the  utility  as
              incrementally  higher.  This simplifies the interface and ensures that the threshold values do not
              get out of order.  This requires specifying the sensor number via -n.

       -m 002000s
              Show SDRs for a specific MC (e.g. bus 00, sa 20, lun 00).  This could be used for  PICMG  or  ATCA
              blade  systems.   The  trailing  character,  if  present, indicates SMI addressing if 's', or IPMB
              addressing if 'i' or not present.

       -n snum
              Number of the sensor to set.  This num can be in decimal, or of the form 0x1a, to match the  value
              shown by sensor following the "snum" tag.  This is required if setting hi/lo thresholds via -h/-l.

       -o     Output  the  memory DIMM information from SMBIOS, including size.  Not available if using IPMI LAN
              via -N.  Sample output:
              Memory Device (0,0): DIMM_A1 : size=2048MB
              Memory Device (0,1): DIMM_A2 : not present

       -p     Persist the threshold being set (as specified via -l or -h).  This writes  a  "sensor  -i"  script
              line  to  the file /usr/share/ipmiutil/thresholds.sh, which can then be executed at each reboot by
              starting the /etc/init.d/ipmi_port service for the desired runlevels.  For Windows,  the  filename
              is thresholds.cmd.

       -q     Show  threshold values in d:d:d format.  Thresholds are shown for each sensor in short format with
              ':' delimiters, which is useful as an example for setting thresholds with '-u'.

       -r     Show Raw SDR bytes also.

       -s     Show sensor list in a simpler/canonical format without  uninterpreted  binary  values.   Only  the
              user-friendly interpreted sensor information is shown.  (same as -c).

       -t     Show any Thresholds for each sensor also, in text format.

       -u     Set unique threshold values.  The values are specified in a string of threshold values.  It can be
              in  raw  hex characters or in float values.  All 6 possible thresholds must be specified, but only
              the ones that are valid for this sensor will be applied. These values are validated for  ordering.
              For example:
                -u 6:5:4:60:65:69 (float) or
                -u 0x0605043c4145 (raw hex)
               would   mean   0x06=noncrit_lo,   0x05=crit_lo,  0x04=nonrec_lo,  0x3c=noncrit_hi,  0x41=crit_hi,
              0x45=nonrec_hi.

       -v     Show Verbose output, including volatile  thresholds,  SDR  thresholds,  max/min,  hysteresis,  and
              BMC_TAM decoding.

       -w     Wrap the threshold data onto the same line as the sensor.  This may be convenient for scripting.

       -x     Causes eXtra debug messages to be displayed.

       -L n   Loop  n  times  every K seconds. Default is one loop and K defaults to 1 second.  See option -k to
              change K seconds if desired.  This is useful along with -i or -g to  read  some  sensors  as  they
              change.  Using -j with this option makes run it quicker.

       -N nodename
              Nodename  or  IP  address  of  the  remote  target  system.   If a nodename is specified, IPMI LAN
              interface is used.  Otherwise the local system management interface is used.

       -P/-R rmt_pswd
              Remote password for the nodename given.  The default is a null password.

       -U rmt_user
              Remote username for the nodename given.  The default is a null username.

       -E     Use the remote password from Environment variable IPMI_PASSWORD.

       -F drv_t
              Force the driver type to one of the followng: imb, va, open, gnu, landesk, lan, lan2, lan2i,  kcs,
              smb.   Note  that  lan2i means lan2 with intelplus.  The default is to detect any available driver
              type and use it.

       -J     Use  the  specified  LanPlus  cipher  suite  (0  thru  17):  0=none/none/none,   1=sha1/none/none,
              2=sha1/sha1/none,  3=sha1/sha1/cbc128, 4=sha1/sha1/xrc4_128, 5=sha1/sha1/xrc4_40, 6=md5/none/none,
              ... 14=md5/md5/xrc4_40.  Default is 3.

       -T     Use a specified IPMI LAN Authentication Type: 0=None, 1=MD2, 2=MD5, 4=Straight Password, 5=OEM.

       -V     Use a specified IPMI LAN privilege  level.  1=Callback  level,  2=User  level,  3=Operator  level,
              4=Administrator level (default), 5=OEM level.

       -Y     Yes, do prompt the user for the IPMI LAN remote password.  Alternatives for the password are -E or
              -P.

       -Z     Set the slave address for a local MC
