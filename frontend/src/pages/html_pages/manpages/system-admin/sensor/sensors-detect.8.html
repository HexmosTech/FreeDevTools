       sensors-detect - detect hardware monitoring chips

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sensors-detect</b> [ <b>--auto</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sensors-detect</b>  is  an interactive program that will walk you through the process of scanning your system
       for various hardware monitoring chips, or sensors, supported by <b><a href="../man3/libsensors.3.html">libsensors</a></b>(3), or more generally  by  the
       lm_sensors tool suite.

       <b>sensors-detect</b> will look for the following devices, in order:

       •      Sensors embedded in CPUs, south bridges and memory controllers.

       •      Sensors embedded in Super I/O chips.

       •      Hardware monitoring chips accessed through ISA I/O ports.

       •      Hardware monitoring chips reachable over the SMBus or more generally any I2C bus on your system.

       As the last two detection steps can cause trouble on some systems, they are normally not attempted if the
       second  detection  step  led  to  the  discovery  of  a  Super I/O chip with complete hardware monitoring
       features.  However, the user is always free to ask for all detection steps if so is his/her  wish.   This
       can be useful if a given system has more than one hardware monitoring chip.  Some vendors are known to do
       this, most notably Asus and Tyan.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --auto Run  in automatic, non-interactive mode.  Assume default answers to all questions.  Note that this
              isn't necessarily safe as the internal logic  may  lead  to  potentially  dangerous  probes  being
              attempted.  See the WARNING section below.

       --stat Display I2C address statistics.

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sensors-detect</b>  needs  to access the hardware for most of the chip detections.  By definition, it doesn't
       know which chips are there before it manages to identify them.  This means that it can access chips in  a
       way  these  chips do not like, causing problems ranging from SMBus lockup to permanent hardware damage (a
       rare case, thankfully.)

       The authors made their best to make the detection as safe as possible, and it turns out to work just fine
       in most cases, however it is impossible to guarantee that <b>sensors-detect</b> will not lock or kill a specific
       system.  So, as a rule of thumb, you should not run <b>sensors-detect</b> on production servers, and you  should
       not  run  <b>sensors-detect</b>  if  you  can't  afford  replacing  a  random  part of your system.  Also, it is
       recommended to not force a detection step which would have been skipped by default, unless you know  what
       you are doing.
