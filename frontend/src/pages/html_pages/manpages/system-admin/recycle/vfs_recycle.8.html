       vfs_recycle - Samba VFS recycle bin

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       vfs objects = recycle

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This VFS module is part of the <b><a href="../man7/samba.7.html">samba</a></b>(7) suite.

       The vfs_recycle intercepts file deletion requests and moves the affected files to a temporary repository
       rather than deleting them immediately. This gives the same effect as the Recycle Bin on Windows
       computers.

       The Recycle Bin will not appear in Windows Explorer views of the network file system (share) nor on any
       mapped drive. Instead, a directory called .recycle will be automatically created when the first file is
       deleted and recycle:repository is not configured. If recycle:repository is configured, the name of the
       created directory depends on recycle:repository. Users can recover files from the recycle bin. If the
       recycle:keeptree option has been specified, deleted files will be found in a path identical with that
       from which the file was deleted.

       This module is stackable.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       recycle:repository = PATH
           Path of the directory where deleted files should be moved.

           If this option is not set, the default path .recycle is used.

       recycle:directory_mode = MODE
           Set MODE to the octal mode the recycle repository should be created with. The recycle repository will
           be created when first file is deleted. If recycle:subdir_mode is not set, MODE also applies to
           subdirectories.

           If this option is not set, the default mode 0700 is used.

       recycle:subdir_mode = MODE
           Set MODE to the octal mode with which sub directories of the recycle repository should be created.

           If this option is not set, subdirectories will be created with the mode from recycle:directory_mode.

       recycle:keeptree = BOOL
           Specifies whether the directory structure should be preserved or whether the files in a directory
           that is being deleted should be kept separately in the repository.

       recycle:versions = BOOL
           If this option is True, two files with the same name that are deleted will both be kept in the
           repository. Newer deleted versions of a file will be called "Copy #x of filename".

       recycle:touch = BOOL
           Specifies whether a file's access date should be updated when the file is moved to the repository.

       recycle:touch_mtime = BOOL
           Specifies whether a file's last modified date should be updated when the file is moved to the
           repository.

       recycle:minsize = BYTES
           Files that are smaller than the number of bytes specified by this parameter will not be put into the
           repository.

       recycle:maxsize = BYTES
           Files that are larger than the number of bytes specified by this parameter will not be put into the
           repository.

       recycle:exclude = LIST
           List of files that should not be put into the repository when deleted, but deleted in the normal way.
           Wildcards such as * and ? are supported.

       recycle:exclude_dir = LIST
           List of directories whose files should not be put into the repository when deleted, but deleted in
           the normal way. Wildcards such as * and ? are supported.

       recycle:noversions = LIST
           Specifies a list of paths (wildcards such as * and ? are supported) for which no versioning should be
           used. Only useful when recycle:versions is enabled.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Move files "deleted" on <u>share</u> to <u>/data/share/.recycle</u> instead of deleting them:

                   <u>[share]</u>
                <b>path</b> <b>=</b> <b>/data/share</b>
                <b>vfs</b> <b>objects</b> <b>=</b> <b>recycle</b>
                <b>recycle:repository</b> <b>=</b> <b>.recycle</b>
                <b>recycle:keeptree</b> <b>=</b> <b>yes</b>
                <b>recycle:versions</b> <b>=</b> <b>yes</b>

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This man page is part of version 4.22.3-Ubuntu-4.22.3+dfsg-4ubuntu1 of the Samba suite.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
       by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
