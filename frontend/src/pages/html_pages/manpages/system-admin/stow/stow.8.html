</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       stow - manage farms of symbolic links

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       stow [ options ] package ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page describes GNU Stow 2.4.1.  This is not the definitive documentation for Stow; for that,
       see the accompanying info manual, e.g. by typing "info stow".

       Stow is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct sets of software and/or data located in separate
       directories on the filesystem, and makes them all appear to be installed in a single directory tree.

       Originally Stow was born to address the need to administer, upgrade, install, and remove files in
       independent software packages without confusing them with other files sharing the same file system space.
       For instance, many years ago it used to be common to compile programs such as Perl and Emacs from source.
       By using Stow, <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u> could contain symlinks to files within <u>/usr/local/stow/emacs/bin</u>,
       <u>/usr/local/stow/perl/bin</u> etc., and likewise recursively for any other subdirectories such as <u>.../share</u>,
       <u>.../man</u>, and so on.

       While this is useful for keeping track of system-wide and per-user installations of software built from
       source, in more recent times software packages are often managed by more sophisticated package management
       software such as rpm, dpkg, and Nix / GNU Guix, or language-native package managers such as Ruby's gem,
       Python's pip, Javascript's npm, and so on.

       However Stow is still used not only for software package management, but also for other purposes, such as
       facilitating a more controlled approach to management of configuration files in the user's home
       directory, especially when coupled with version control systems.

       Stow was inspired by Carnegie Mellon's Depot program, but is substantially simpler and safer. Whereas
       Depot required database files to keep things in sync, Stow stores no extra state between runs, so there's
       no danger (as there was in Depot) of mangling directories when file hierarchies don't match the database.
       Also unlike Depot, Stow will never delete any files, directories, or links that appear in a Stow
       directory (e.g., <u>/usr/local/stow/emacs</u>), so it's always possible to rebuild the target tree (e.g.,
       <u><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></u>).

       Stow is implemented as a combination of a Perl script providing a CLI interface, and a backend Perl
       module which does most of the work.

</pre><h4><b>TERMINOLOGY</b></h4><pre>
       A "package" is a related collection of files and directories that you wish to administer as a unit --
       e.g., Perl or Emacs -- and that needs to be installed in a particular directory structure -- e.g., with
       <u>bin</u>, <u>lib</u>, and <u>man</u> subdirectories.

       A "target directory" is the root of a tree in which one or more packages wish to <b>appear</b> to be installed.
       A common, but by no means the only such location is <u><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></u>.  The examples in this manual page will
       use <u><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></u> as the target directory.

       A "stow directory" is the root of a tree containing separate packages in private subtrees. When Stow
       runs, it uses the current directory as the default stow directory. The examples in this manual page will
       use <u>/usr/local/stow</u> as the stow directory, so that individual packages will be, for example,
       <u>/usr/local/stow/perl</u> and <u>/usr/local/stow/emacs</u>.

       An "installation image" is the layout of files and directories required by a package, relative to the
       target directory. Thus, the installation image for Perl includes: a <u>bin</u> directory containing <u>perl</u> and <u>a2p</u>
       (among others); an <u>info</u> directory containing Texinfo documentation; a <u>lib/perl</u> directory containing Perl
       libraries; and a <u>man/man1</u> directory containing man pages.

       A "package directory" is the root of a tree containing the installation image for a particular package.
       Each package directory must reside in a stow directory -- e.g., the package directory
       <u>/usr/local/stow/perl</u> must reside in the stow directory <u>/usr/local/stow</u>.  The "name" of a package is the
       name of its directory within the stow directory -- e.g., <u>perl</u>.

       Thus, the Perl executable might reside in <u>/usr/local/stow/perl/bin/perl</u>, where <u><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></u> is the target
       directory, <u>/usr/local/stow</u> is the stow directory, <u>/usr/local/stow/perl</u> is the package directory, and
       <u>bin/perl</u> within is part of the installation image.

       A "symlink" is a symbolic link. A symlink can be "relative" or "absolute". An absolute symlink names a
       full path; that is, one starting from <u>/</u>.  A relative symlink names a relative path; that is, one not
       starting from <u>/</u>.  The target of a relative symlink is computed starting from the symlink's own directory.
       Stow only creates relative symlinks.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The stow directory is assumed to be the value of the "STOW_DIR" environment variable or if unset the
       current directory, and the target directory is assumed to be the parent of the current directory (so it
       is typical to execute <u>stow</u> from the directory <u>/usr/local/stow</u>).  Each <u>package</u> given on the command line
       is the name of a package in the stow directory (e.g., <u>perl</u>).  By default, they are installed into the
       target directory (but they can be deleted instead using "-D").

       -n
       --no
       --simulate
           Do not perform any operations that modify the filesystem; merely show what would happen.

       -d DIR
       --dir=DIR
           Set the stow directory to "DIR" instead of the current directory.  This also has the effect of making
           the default target directory be the parent of "DIR".

       -t DIR
       --target=DIR
           Set the target directory to "DIR" instead of the parent of the stow directory.

       -v
       --verbose[=N]
           Send  verbose  output to standard error describing what Stow is doing. Verbosity levels are from 0 to
           5; 0 is the default.  Using "-v" or "--verbose" increases the verbosity by one;  using  `--verbose=N'
           sets it to N.

       -S
       --stow
           Stow  the packages that follow this option into the target directory.  This is the default action and
           so  can  be  omitted  if  you  are  only  stowing  packages  rather  than  performing  a  mixture  of
           stow/delete/restow actions.

       -D
       --delete
           Unstow the packages that follow this option from the target directory rather than installing them.

       -R
       --restow
           Restow  packages  (first  unstow, then stow again). This is useful for pruning obsolete symlinks from
           the target tree after updating the software in a package.

       --adopt
           <b>Warning!</b>  This behaviour is specifically intended to alter the contents of your stow  directory.   If
           you do not want that, this option is not for you.

           When  stowing,  if  a  target  is encountered which already exists but is a plain file (and hence not
           owned by any existing stow package), then normally Stow will register this as a conflict  and  refuse
           to  proceed.  This option changes that behaviour so that the file is moved to the same relative place
           within the package's installation image within the stow  directory,  and  then  stowing  proceeds  as
           before.  So effectively, the file becomes adopted by the stow package, without its contents changing.

       --no-folding
           Disable folding of newly stowed directories when stowing, and refolding of newly foldable directories
           when unstowing.

       --ignore=REGEX
           Ignore files ending in this Perl regex.

       --defer=REGEX
           Don't stow files beginning with this Perl regex if the file is already stowed to another package.

       --override=REGEX
           Force stowing files beginning with this Perl regex if the file is already stowed to another package.

       --dotfiles
           Enable  special  handling  for  "dotfiles"  (files or folders whose name begins with a period) in the
           package directory. If this option is enabled, Stow will add a preprocessing step  for  each  file  or
           folder whose name begins with "dot-", and replace the "dot-" prefix in the name by a period (.). This
           is  useful  when  Stow is used to manage collections of dotfiles, to avoid having a package directory
           full of hidden files.

           For  example,   suppose   we   have   a   package   containing   two   files,   <u>stow/dot-bashrc</u>   and
           <u>stow/dot-emacs.d/init.el</u>. With this option, Stow will create symlinks from <u>.bashrc</u> to <u>stow/dot-bashrc</u>
           and  from  <u>.emacs.d/init.el</u>  to  <u>stow/dot-emacs.d/init.el</u>. Any other files, whose name does not begin
           with "dot-", will be processed as usual.

       -V
       --version
           Show Stow version number, and exit.

       -h
       --help
           Show Stow command syntax, and exit.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLING</b> <b>PACKAGES</b></h4><pre>
       The default action of Stow is to install a package. This means creating symlinks in the target tree  that
       point  into the package tree.  Stow attempts to do this with as few symlinks as possible; in other words,
       if Stow can create a single symlink that points to an entire subtree within the  package  tree,  it  will
       choose to do that rather than create a directory in the target tree and populate it with symlinks.

       For  example,  suppose  that  no  packages  have  yet been installed in <u><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></u>; it's completely empty
       (except for the <u>stow</u> subdirectory, of course). Now suppose the Perl package is installed.  Recall that it
       includes the following directories in its installation image: <u>bin</u>; <u>info</u>; <u>lib/perl</u>; <u>man/man1</u>.  Rather than
       creating the directory <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u> and  populating  it  with  symlinks  to  <u>../stow/perl/bin/perl</u>  and
       <u>../stow/perl/bin/a2p</u>  (and  so  on),  Stow  will create a single symlink, <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u>, which points to
       <u>stow/perl/bin</u>.  In this way, it still works to refer to <u>/usr/local/bin/perl</u> and  <u>/usr/local/bin/a2p</u>,  and
       fewer symlinks have been created. This is called "tree folding", since an entire subtree is "folded" into
       a single symlink.

       To  complete  this example, Stow will also create the symlink <u>/usr/local/info</u> pointing to <u>stow/perl/info</u>;
       the symlink <u><a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a></u>  pointing  to  <u>stow/perl/lib</u>;  and  the  symlink  <u><a href="file:/usr/local/man">/usr/local/man</a></u>  pointing  to
       <u>stow/perl/man</u>.

       Now suppose that instead of installing the Perl package into an empty target tree, the target tree is not
       empty  to  begin  with.  Instead,  it  contains several files and directories installed under a different
       system-administration philosophy. In particular, <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u> already exists and is a directory, as are
       <u><a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a></u> and <u>/usr/local/man/man1</u>.  In this case, Stow will descend into <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u>  and  create
       symlinks   to   <u>../stow/perl/bin/perl</u>   and   <u>../stow/perl/bin/a2p</u>  (etc.),  and  it  will  descend  into
       <u><a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a></u> and create the tree-folding symlink <u>perl</u> pointing to <u>../stow/perl/lib/perl</u>, and so on.  As
       a  rule,  Stow  only  descends as far as necessary into the target tree when it can create a tree-folding
       symlink.

       The time often comes when a tree-folding symlink has to be undone because another  package  uses  one  or
       more  of the folded subdirectories in its installation image. This operation is called "splitting open" a
       folded tree. It involves removing the original symlink from the target tree, creating a true directory in
       its place, and then populating the new directory with symlinks to the newly-installed package <b>and</b> to  the
       old  package  that  used  the  old symlink. For example, suppose that after installing Perl into an empty
       <u><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></u>, we wish to install Emacs.  Emacs's installation image includes a <u>bin</u> directory containing the
       <u>emacs</u> and <u>etags</u> executables, among others.  Stow  must  make  these  files  appear  to  be  installed  in
       <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u>,  but  presently  <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u>  is a symlink to <u>stow/perl/bin</u>.  Stow therefore takes the
       following steps: the symlink <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u> is deleted; the directory <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u>  is  created;  links
       are  made  from <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u> to <u>../stow/emacs/bin/emacs</u> and <u>../stow/emacs/bin/etags</u>; and links are made
       from <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u> to <u>../stow/perl/bin/perl</u> and <u>../stow/perl/bin/a2p</u>.

       When splitting open a folded tree, Stow makes sure that the symlink it is about to remove points inside a
       valid package in the current stow directory.

   <b>Stow</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>delete</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>doesn't</b> <b>own.</b>
       Stow "owns" everything living in the target tree that points  into  a  package  in  the  stow  directory.
       Anything  Stow  owns, it can recompute if lost. Note that by this definition, Stow doesn't "own" anything
       <b>in</b> the stow directory or in any of the packages.

       If Stow needs to create a directory or a symlink in the target tree and it cannot because  that  name  is
       already  in  use and is not owned by Stow, then a conflict has arisen. See the "Conflicts" section in the
       info manual.

</pre><h4><b>DELETING</b> <b>PACKAGES</b></h4><pre>
       When the "-D" option is given, the action of Stow is to delete a package from the target tree. Note  that
       Stow  will  not  delete  anything it doesn't "own". Deleting a package does <b>not</b> mean removing it from the
       stow directory or discarding the package tree.

       To delete a package, Stow recursively scans the target tree, skipping over the stow directory (since that
       is usually a subdirectory of the target tree) and any other stow directories it encounters (see "Multiple
       stow directories" in the info manual). Any symlink it finds that points into the package being deleted is
       removed. Any directory that contained only  symlinks  to  the  package  being  deleted  is  removed.  Any
       directory  that,  after  removing  symlinks  and empty subdirectories, contains only symlinks to a single
       other package, is considered to be a previously "folded" tree that was "split open."  Stow  will  re-fold
       the  tree  by  removing  the  symlinks to the surviving package, removing the directory, then linking the
       directory back to the surviving package.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCE</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Stow</u> searches for default command line  options  at  <u>.stowrc</u>  (current  directory)  and  <u><a href="file:~/.stowrc">~/.stowrc</a></u>  (home
       directory) in that order. If both locations are present, the files are effectively appended together.

       The  effect  of  options  in the resource file is similar to simply prepending the options to the command
       line. For options that provide a single value, such as <u>--target</u> or <u>--dir</u>, the command  line  option  will
       overwrite  any  options  in the resource file. For options that can be given more than once, <u>--ignore</u> for
       example, command line options and resource options are appended together.

       Environment variables and the tilde character (<u>~</u>) will be expanded for options that take a file path.

       The options <u>-D</u>, <u>-R</u>, <u>-S</u>, and any packages listed in the resource file are ignored.

       See the info manual for more information on how stow handles resource file.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The full documentation for <u>stow</u> is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the <u>info</u>  and  <u>stow</u>  programs  are
       properly installed at your site, the command

           info stow

       should give you access to the complete manual.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Please report bugs in Stow using the Debian bug tracking system.

       Currently known bugs include:

       •   The empty-directory problem.

           If  package  <u>foo</u>  includes  an  empty directory -- say, <u>foo/bar</u> -- then if no other package has a <u>bar</u>
           subdirectory, everything's fine.  If another stowed package <u>quux</u>, has a <u>bar</u> subdirectory,  then  when
           stowing, <u>targetdir/bar</u> will be "split open" and the contents of <u>quux/bar</u> will be individually stowed.
           So far, so good. But when unstowing <u>quux</u>, <u>targetdir/bar</u> will be removed, even though <u>foo/bar</u> needs it
           to  remain.   A  workaround  for this problem is to create a file in <u>foo/bar</u> as a placeholder. If you
           name that file <u>.placeholder</u>, it will be easy to find and remove such files when this bug is fixed.

       •   When using multiple stow directories (see "Multiple stow directories" in the info manual), Stow fails
           to "split open" tree-folding symlinks (see "Installing packages" in the info manual) that point  into
           a  stow  directory which is not the one in use by the current Stow command. Before failing, it should
           search the target of the link to see whether any element of the path contains a  <u>.stow</u>  file.  If  it
           finds  one, it can "learn" about the cooperating stow directory to short-circuit the <u>.stow</u> search the
           next time it encounters a tree-folding symlink.
