</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pam_ssh_agent_auth - PAM module for granting permissions based on SSH agent requests

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides authentication via ssh-agent.  If an ssh-agent listening at SSH_AUTH_SOCK can
       successfully authenticate that it has the secret key for a public key in the specified file,
       authentication is granted, otherwise authentication fails.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/etc/pam.d/sudo">/etc/pam.d/sudo</a>: auth    sufficient     pam_ssh_agent_auth.so file=/etc/security/authorized_keys
       <a href="file:/etc/sudoers">/etc/sudoers</a>:
           In older versions of sudo (&lt; 1.8.5) it was necessary to set:
            Defaults    env_keep += "SSH_AUTH_SOCK"

       This  configuration  would permit anyone who has an SSH_AUTH_SOCK that manages the private key matching a
       public key in /etc/security/authorized_keys to execute sudo without having to enter a password. Note that
       the ssh-agent listening to SSH_AUTH_SOCK can either be local, or forwarded.

       Unlike NOPASSWD, this still requires an authentication, it's just that the authentication is provided  by
       ssh-agent, and not password entry.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       file=&lt;path to authorized_keys&gt;
           Specify  the path to the authorized_keys file(s) you would like to use for authentication. Subject to
           tilde and % EXPANSIONS (below)

       allow_user_owned_authorized_keys_file
           A flag which enables authorized_keys files to be owned by the invoking user, instead  of  root.  This
           flag is enabled automatically whenever the expansions %h or ~ are used.

       authorized_keys_command=&lt;path to executable&gt;
           Specify  an  external command to run, which should take a single argument, the username of the person
           being authenticated, and emit to its stdout a file in authorized_keys format.  This is ideally suited
           for use with sssd's sss_ssh_authorizedkeys, for authenticating users via  authorized_keys  stored  in
           ldap or other sssd supported security service.

       authorized_keys_command_user=&lt;username&gt;
           Specify  a  user  to  run  the  authorized_keys_command  as.  If  this  option  is not specified, the
           authorized_keys_command will be run as the user being authenticated.

       debug
           A flag which enables verbose logging

       sudo_service_name=&lt;service name you compiled sudo to use&gt;
           (when compiled with --enable-sudo-hack)

           Specify the service name to use to identify the  service  "sudo".  When  the  PAM_SERVICE  identifier
           matches  this  string,  and  if PAM_RUSER is not set, pam_ssh_agent_auth will attempt to identify the
           calling user from the environment variable SUDO_USER.

           This defaults to "sudo".

</pre><h4><b>EXPANSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       ~  -- same as in shells, a user's Home directory
           Automatically enables allow_user_owned_authorized_keys_file if used in the context of <a href="file:~/.">~/.</a> If used  as
           ~user/,   it   would   expect   the   file   to  be  owned  by  'user',  unless  you  explicitly  set
           allow_user_owned_authorized_keys_file

       %h -- User's Home directory
           Automatically enables allow_user_owned_authorized_keys_file

       %H -- The short-hostname
       %u -- Username
       %f -- FQDN

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       in <a href="file:/etc/pam.d/sudo">/etc/pam.d/sudo</a>

       "auth sufficient pam_ssh_agent_auth.so file=<a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a>"
           The default .ssh/authorized_keys file in a user's home-directory

       "auth sufficient pam_ssh_agent_auth.so file=%h/.ssh/authorized_keys"
           Same as above.

       "auth sufficient pam_ssh_agent_auth.so file=~fred/.ssh/authorized_keys"
           If   the   home-directory   of   user   'fred'    was    /home/fred,    this    would    expand    to
           /home/fred/.ssh/authorized_keys.       In      this      case,      we     have     not     specified
           allow_user_owned_authorized_keys_file, so this file must be owned by 'fred'.

       "auth sufficient pam_ssh_agent_auth.so file=/secure/%H/%u/authorized_keys
       allow_user_owned_authorized_keys_file"
           On   a   host   named   foobar.baz.com,   and    a    user    named    fred,    would    expand    to
           /secure/foobar/fred/authorized_keys.          In         this        case,        we        specified
           allow_user_owned_authorized_keys_file, so fred would be able  to  manage  that  authorized_keys  file
           himself.

       "auth sufficient pam_ssh_agent_auth.so file=/secure/%f/%u/authorized_keys"
           On    a    host    named    foobar.baz.com,    and    a    user   named   fred,   would   expand   to
           /secure/foobar.baz.com/fred/authorized_keys.    In    this    case,    we    have    not    specified
           allow_user_owned_authorized_keys_file, so this file must be owned by root.

       "auth [success=3 default=ignore] pam_ssh_agent_auth.so file=<a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a> debug"
           This  pam.d  config  format allows for more control over how pam handles success and failure. In this
           example, we use success=3, which specifies that when this module succeeds, pam should jump  over  the
           next  3 auth modules and continue from there. This is useful, for instance, if <a href="file:/etc/pam.d/common-auth">/etc/pam.d/common-auth</a>
           is included, and contains 3 "auth required" or similar module rules that we wish to skip, but we wish
           not to skip other auth rules.
