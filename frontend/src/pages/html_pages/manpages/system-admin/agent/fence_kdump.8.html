       fence_kdump - fencing agent for use with kdump crash recovery service

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       fence_kdump  is  an  I/O  fencing  agent  to  be  used  with  the  kdump crash recovery service. When the
       fence_kdump agent is invoked, it will listen for a message from the failed node  that  acknowledges  that
       the  failed  node  is  executing  the kdump crash kernel.  Note that fence_kdump is not a replacement for
       traditional fencing methods. The fence_kdump agent can only detect that a  node  has  entered  the  kdump
       crash  recovery service. This allows the kdump crash recovery service complete without being preempted by
       traditional power fencing methods.

       Note: the "off" action listen for message from failed node that acknowledges node has entered kdump crash
       recovery service. If a valid message is received from the failed node,  the  node  is  considered  to  be
       fenced  and  the  agent  returns  success. Failure to receive a valid message from the failed node in the
       given timeout period results in fencing failure. When multiple node names/IP addresses  are  specified  a
       single  valid  message  is  sufficient  for success. This is useful when single node can send message via
       several different IP addresses.

       The fence agent accepts options on the command line as  well  as  from  stdin.  Fenced  sends  parameters
       through stdin when it execs the agent. The agent can be run by itself with command line options.  This is
       useful for testing and for turning outlets on or off from scripts.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--nodename=NODE[,NODE...]</b>
              List  of names or IP addresses of node to be fenced. This option is required for the "off" action.
              Multiple values separated by commas can be specified. All  values  must  be  of  same  IP  network
              family.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--ipport=PORT</b>
              IP  port  number that the fence_kdump agent will use to listen for messages. (Default Value: 7410)

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--family=FAMILY</b>
              IP network family. Force the fence_kdump agent to use a specific family. The value for FAMILY  can
              be "auto", "ipv4", or "ipv6". (Default Value: auto)

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--action=ACTION</b>
              Fencing action to perform. The value for ACTION can be either "off" or "metadata". (Default Value:
              off)

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--timeout=TIMEOUT</b>
              Number  of  seconds to wait for message from failed node. If no message is received within TIMEOUT
              seconds, the fence_kdump agent returns failure. (Default Value: 60)

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Print verbose output

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print version

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print usage

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>off</b>    Power off machine.

              Number of seconds to wait for message from failed node. If no message is received  within  TIMEOUT
              seconds, the fence_kdump agent returns failure. (Default Value: 60)
