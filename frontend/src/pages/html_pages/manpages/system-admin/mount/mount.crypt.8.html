</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       mount.crypt - mount a dm-crypt encrypted volume

</pre><h4><b>Syntax</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mount.crypt</b> [<b>-nrv</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>options</u>] <u>device</u> <u>directory</u>

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o</b> <u>options</u>
              Set  further mount options. mount.crypt will take out its own options it recognizes and passes any
              remaining options on to the underlying mount program. See below for possible options.

       <b>-n</b>     Do not update /etc/mtab. Note that this makes it impossible to unmount the volume  by  naming  the
              container - you will have to pass the mountpoint to umount.crypt.

       <b>-r</b>     Set up the loop device (if necessary) and crypto device in read-only mode.  (The mount itself will
              necessarily  also  be  read-only.) Note that doing a remount using `mount <a href="file:/mnt">/mnt</a> -o remount,rw` will
              <b>not</b> make the mount readwrite. The crypto and loop devices will have to be disassociated first.

       <b>-v</b>     Turn on debugging and be a bit more verbose.

</pre><h4><b>Mount</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>header</b> A detached (separated) metadata file where the LUKS header  is  stored.  It  correlates  with  the
              `cryptsetup --header` option. If omitted, the detached LUKS header feature is not used.

       <b>allow_discard</b>
              Enables  discard passthrough support. This option does not cause the filesystem to be mounted with
              discard enabled, but does allow fstrim to be manually run.

       <b>no_read_workqueue</b>
              Bypass internal workqueue and process read requests synchronously.

       <b>no_write_workqueue</b>
              Bypass internal workqueue and process write requests synchronously.

       <b>cipher</b> The cryptsetup cipher used for the encrypted volume. This option is mandatory for PLAIN (non-LUKS)
              volumes. <a href="../man8/pmt-ehd.8.html">pmt-ehd</a>(8) defaults to creating volumes with "aes-cbc-essiv:sha256" as a cipher.

       <b>crypto_name</b>
              Select the name for the crypto device (optional). This option is currently only  usable  with  dm-
              crypt systems.

       <b>fsck</b>   Run fsck on the container before mounting it.

       <b>fsk_cipher</b>
              The  OpenSSL  cipher used for the filesystem key. The special keyword "none" can be used to bypass
              decryption and pass the file contents directly to libcryptsetup.

       <b>fsk_hash</b>
              The OpenSSL hash used for producing key and IV.

       <b>fstype</b> The exact type of filesystem in the  encrypted  container.  The  default  is  to  let  the  kernel
              autodetect.

       <b>hash</b>   The  cryptsetup hash used for the encrypted volume. This defaults to no hashing, because pam_mount
              assumes EHD volumes with strong and simple fskey generation.

       <b>keyfile</b>
              The path to the key file. This option is mandatory for "normal" crypto volumes and should  not  be
              used for LUKS volumes.

       <b>remount</b>
              Causes  the  filesystem  to be remounted with new options. Note that mount.crypt cannot switch the
              underlying loop device (if applies) or the crypto device between read-only and read-write once  it
              is  created;  only  the actual filesystem mount can be changed, with limits. If the loop device is
              read-only, the crypto  device  will  be  read-only,  and  changing  the  mount  to  read-write  is
              impossible.  Similarly, going from rw to ro will only mark the mount read-only, but not the crypto
              or loop device, thus making it impossible to set the filesystem the crypto container is located on
              to read-only.

       <b>ro</b>     Same as the <b>-r</b> option.

       <b>verbose</b>
              Same as the <b>-v</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>Obsolete</b> <b>mount</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       This section is provided for reference.

       <b>loop</b>   This option used to set up a loop device, because <a href="../man8/cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup</a>(8) expects a block device. The option
              is ignored because mount.crypt can figure this out on its own.
