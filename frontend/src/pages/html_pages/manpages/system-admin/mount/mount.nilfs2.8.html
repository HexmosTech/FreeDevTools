       mount.nilfs2 - mount a NILFS2 file system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mount</b> <b>-t</b> <b>nilfs2</b> [<b>-finrvw</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>options</u> [<b>,</b>...]] <u>device</u> <u>dir</u>
       <b>mount</b> <b>-t</b> <b>nilfs2</b> [<b>-finrvw</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>options</u> [<b>,</b>...]] <u>device</u> | <u>dir</u>

       <b>mount.nilfs2</b> [<b>-fnrvw</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>options</u> [<b>,</b>...]] <u>device</u> <u>dir</u>

       <b>mount.nilfs2</b> [<b>-V</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mount.nilfs2</b>  serves  to attach a NILFS2 file system on the specified directory <u>dir</u>. It is intended to be
       executed from <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8), and will invoke the garbage collector <b><a href="../man8/nilfs_cleanerd.8.html">nilfs_cleanerd</a></b>(8)  after  an  actual  mount
       system  call  has  succeeded.   Conversely,  <b><a href="../man8/umount.nilfs2.8.html">umount.nilfs2</a></b>(8)  will shutdown the garbage collector before
       detaching the file system.

       The standard command line interface is the first form:
              <b>mount</b> <b>-t</b> <b>nilfs2</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>device</u> <u>dir</u>
       This tells the kernel to attach the NILFS2 file system on <u>device</u> at the directory <u>dir</u>.  With  the  second
       form, the mount program tries to find out a missing <u>device</u> or <u>dir</u> argument from the <u><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></u> table.

       The  third  form,  which  directly  invokes  <b>mount.nilfs2</b>, is also usable since <b>mount.nilfs2</b> maintains by
       itself the system mount state such as the list of mounted file systems described in  <u><a href="file:/etc/mtab">/etc/mtab</a></u>.  However,
       the  first  or the second form is usually recommended because some expansive options are not supported by
       the third form.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The full set of options used by an invocation of <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8) is determined by extracting  the  options  from
       the  <u>fstab</u> table, then applying any options specified by the <b>-o</b> argument, and finally applying a <b>-r</b> or <b>-w</b>
       option, when present.

       See <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8) for the full set of options.  Commonly used options are as follows:

       <b>-V</b>     Output version.

       <b>-f</b>     Fakes mounting the file system, meaning that the actual system call will be skipped.  This  option
              is  used  to  add entries for devices that were mounted earlier with the <b>-n</b> option. It can also be
              used for invoking <b><a href="../man8/nilfs_cleanerd.8.html">nilfs_cleanerd</a></b>(8) skipped previously.

       <b>-i</b>     Don't call <b>mount.nilfs2</b>.  This disables garbage collection and handling of pseudo mount options.

       <b>-n</b>     Mount without writing in <u><a href="file:/etc/mtab">/etc/mtab</a></u>.  This is necessary for example when <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u>  is  on  a  read-only
              file system.

       <b>-r</b>     Mount the file system read-only.  A synonym is <b>"-o</b> <b>ro"</b>.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose mode.

       <b>-w</b>     Mount the file system read/write. This is the default. A synonym is <b>"-o</b> <b>rw"</b>.

       <b>-o</b>     Options  are  specified  with  a <b>-o</b> flag followed by a comma separated string of options.  Some of
              these options are only useful when they appear in the <u><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></u> file.   For  standard  filesystem
              options, see <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8).

</pre><h4><b>NILFS2</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>MOUNT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options apply only to the NILFS2 filesystem.  They all follow the <b>-o</b> flag.

       <b>barrier</b> / <b>nobarrier</b>
              These  options  enable/disable  (default  is  enabled) barrier writes for the block I/O to a lower
              device.  The barrier write serves an important role to ensure consistency of filesystems  after  a
              system  crash  or  power  failure.  NILFS2 uses this feature by default to assure the reliability.
              For devices not supporting the barrier write, it will be disabled automatically and a warning will
              be logged.

       <b>cp=</b><u>checkpoint-number</u>
              Specify the <u>checkpoint-number</u> of the snapshot to be mounted.  Checkpoints and snapshots are listed
              by <b><a href="../man1/lscp.1.html">lscp</a></b>(1).  Only the checkpoints marked as snapshot are mountable with this  option.   Note  that
              the read-only mount option must be specified together.

       <b>errors=continue</b> / <b>errors=remount-ro</b> / <b>errors=panic</b>
              Define  the  behaviour when an error is encountered.  (Either ignore errors and just mark the file
              system erroneous and continue, or remount the  file  system  read-only,  or  panic  and  halt  the
              system.)   The  default  is  remount-ro.   In  earlier kernels than Linux 2.6.35, continue was the
              default.

       <b>pp=</b><u>protection-period</u>
              Specify the <u>protection-period</u> for the cleaner daemon (in seconds).  nilfs_cleanerd  never  deletes
              recent checkpoints whose elapsed time from its creation is smaller than <u>protection-period</u>.

       <b>nogc</b>   Disable  garbage  collection.  The  cleaner  daemon  will  not  be  started.  It can be be started
              manually, but in that case it must also be stopped manually before unmounting.

       <b>order=relaxed</b> / <b>order=strict</b>
              Specify order semantics for file data.  Metadata is always written to follow the  POSIX  semantics
              about the order of filesystem operations.

              <b>relaxed</b>
                     Apply  relaxed  order  semantics  that  allows  modified  data blocks to be written to disk
                     without making a checkpoint if no metadata update is going.  This mode is equivalent to the
                     ordered data mode of the ext3 filesystem except  for  the  updates  on  data  blocks  still
                     conserve atomicity.  This will improve synchronous write performance for overwriting.  This
                     is the default mode.

              <b>strict</b> Apply  strict  in-order  semantics that preserves sequence of all file operations including
                     overwriting of data blocks.  That means, it is guaranteed  that  no  overtaking  of  events
                     occurs  in  the recovered file system after a crash.  Unlike journaling filesystems, NILFS2
                     does not write a same block  twice  to  disk.   So  there  is  no  significant  performance
                     degradation in comparison with the relaxed mode except for file overwriting.

       <b>norecovery</b>
              Disable  recovery  of the filesystem on mount.  This disables every write access on the device for
              read-only mounts or snapshots.  This option will fail for r/w mounts on an unclean volume.

       <b>discard</b> / <b>nodiscard</b>
              These options enable/disable  (default  is  disabled)  the  use  of  discard/TRIM  commands.   The
              discard/TRIM  commands  are  sent  to  the underlying block device when blocks are freed.  This is
              useful for SSD devices and sparse/thinly-provisioned LUNs. (since 2.6.34).

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       The return codes of <b>mount.nilfs2</b> conform to those of <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8); the following codes could be returned (the

       <b>4</b>      internal bug

       <b>8</b>      user interrupt

       <b>16</b>     problems writing or locking <a href="file:/etc/mtab">/etc/mtab</a>

       <b>32</b>     mount failure

       <b>64</b>     some mount succeeded
