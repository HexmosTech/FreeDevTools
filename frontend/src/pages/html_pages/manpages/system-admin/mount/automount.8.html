       automount - manage autofs mount points

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>automount</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>master_map</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>automount</b>  program  is  used  to  manage  mount  points  for  autofs, the inlined Linux automounter.
       <b>automount</b> works by reading the <b><a href="../man5/auto.master.5.html">auto.master</a></b>(5) map and sets up mount points for each entry in  the  master
       map  allowing  them  to  be  automatically mounted when accessed. The file systems are then automatically
       umounted after a period of inactivity.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-h,</u> <u>--help</u>
              Print brief help on program usage.

       <u>-p,</u> <u>--pid-file</u>
              Write the pid of the daemon to the specified file.

       <u>-t</u> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;,</u> <u>--timeout</u> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              Set the global minimum timeout, in seconds, until directories are unmounted.  The  default  is  10
              minutes. Setting the timeout to zero disables umounts completely.  The internal program default is
              10  minutes, but the default installed configuration overrides this and sets the timeout to 5 min‐
              utes to be consistent with earlier autofs releases.

       <u>-M</u> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;,</u> <u>--master-wait</u> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              Set the maximum time to wait for the master map to become available if it cannot be read  at  pro‐
              gram start.

       <u>-n</u> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;,</u> <u>--negative-timeout</u> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              Set the default timeout for caching failed key lookups. The default is 60 seconds.

       <u>-v,</u> <u>--verbose</u>
              Enables logging of general status and progress messages for all autofs managed mounts.

       <b>-d</b>[<u>LEVEL</u>], <b>--debug</b>[=<u>LEVEL</u>]
              Enables logging of general status and progress messages as well as debugging messages for all aut‐
              ofs managed mounts. The default <u>LEVEL</u> is 0.  automounter must perform OpenLDAP authenticated binds
              for  optional  argument  <u>LEVEL</u>  to have any effect. OpenLDAP uses a bitmap to enable debugging for
              specific components. Debug <u>LEVEL</u>=0 disables libldap deugging.  For further details see <b><a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd</a></b>(8).

       <u>-Dvariable=value,</u> <u>--define</u> <u>variable=value</u>
              Define a global macro substitution variable. Global definitions are over-ridden macro  definitions
              of the same name specified in mount entries.

       <u>-S,</u> <u>--systemd-service</u>
              Used  when  running  the automounter as a systemd service to ensure log entry format is consistent
              with the log entry format when running as a daemon.

       <u>-f,</u> <u>--foreground</u>
              Run the daemon in the foreground and log to stderr instead of syslog."

       <u>-r,</u> <u>--random-multimount-selection</u>
              Enables the use of random selection when choosing a host from a list of replicated servers.

       <u>-m,</u> <u>--dumpmaps</u> <u>[&lt;map</u> <u>type&gt;</u> <u>&lt;map</u> <u>name&gt;]</u>
              With no parameters, list information about the configured automounter maps, then exit.

              If the dumpmaps option is given and is followed by two parameters, "&lt;map type&gt;  &lt;map  name&gt;"  then
              simple "&lt;key, value&gt;" pairs that would be read in by a map read are printed to stdout if the given
              map type and map name are found in the map configuration.

              If  the  map is an LDAP map and there is more than one map of same name in different base dns only
              the first map encountered by autofs will be listed. Similarly, if the map is a file map and  there
              is  more  than  one  map of the same name in different directories, only the first map encountered
              will be listed.

              If the map type is an old style multi-map and any one of the map  names  in  the  multi-map  entry
              matches  the  given map name the entries that would be used by autofs for the whole multi-map will
              be listed.

       <u>-O,</u> <u>--global-options</u>
              Allows the specification of global mount options used for all master map  entries.  These  options
              will  either  replace  or  be appended to options given in a master map entry depending on the AP‐
              PEND_OPTIONS configuration setting.

       <u>-V,</u> <u>--version</u>
              Display the version number, then exit.

       <u>-l,</u> <u>--set-log-priority</u> <u>priority</u> <u>path</u> <u>[path,...]</u>
              Set the daemon log priority to the specified value.  Valid values include the numbers 0-7, or  the
              strings  emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, or debug. Log level debug will log every‐
              thing, log levels info, warn (or warning), or notice with enable the daemon verbose  logging.  Any
              other  level  will  set  basic  logging. Note that enabling debug or verbose logging in the autofs
              global configuration will override dynamic log level changes. For example, if verbose  logging  is
              set  in  the  configuration then attempting to set logging to basic logging, by using alert, crit,
              err or emerg won't stop the verbose logging. However, setting logging to debug will lead to every‐
              thing (debug logging) being logged witch can then also be disabled, returning the daemon  to  ver‐
              bose  logging.  This  option can be specified to change the logging priority of an already running
              automount process.

              The <u>path</u> argument corresponds to the automounted path name as specified in the master map.

       <u>-C,</u> <u>--dont-check-daemon</u>
              Don't check if the daemon is currently running (see NOTES).

       <u>-F,</u> <u>--force</u>
              Force an unlink umount of existing mounts under configured  autofs  managed  mount  points  during
              startup.  This  can cause problems for processes with working directories within these mounts (see
              NOTES).

       <u>-U,</u> <u>--force-exit</u>
              Force an unlink umount of existing mounts under configured autofs managed mount  points  and  exit
              rather than continuing the startup. This can cause problems for processes with working directories
              within these mounts (see NOTES).

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>automount</b> takes one optional argument, the name of the master map to use.

       <b>master_map</b>
              Location  for  autofs  master map that defines autofs managed mount points and the mount maps they
              will use. The default is <b>auto.master</b>.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       If the <b>automount</b> daemon catches a USR1 signal, it will umount all currently unused autofs managed mounted
       file systems and continue running (forced expire).  If it catches the TERM signal it will umount all  un‐
       used  autofs managed mounted file systems and exit if there are no remaining busy file systems. If autofs
       has been compiled with the option to ignore busy mounts on exit it will exit leaving any busy  mounts  in
       place  otherwise busy file systems will not be umounted and autofs will not exit.  Alternatively, if aut‐
       ofs has been compiled with the option to enable forced shutdown then a USR2 signal  to  the  daemon  will
       cause all mounts to be umounted and any busy mounts to be forcibly umounted, including autofs mount point
       directories (summary execution). Note that the forced umount is an unlink operation and the actual umount
       will  not happen in the kernel until active file handles are released.  The daemon also responds to a HUP
       signal which triggers an update of the maps for each mount point.

       If any autofs mount point directories are busy when the daemon is sent an exit signal the daemon will not
       exit. The exception to this is if autofs has been built with configure  options  to  either  ignore  busy
       mounts  at exit or force umount at exit. If the ignore busy mounts at exit option is used the filesystems
       will be left in a catatonic (non-functional) state and can be manually umounted when they become  unused.
       If the force umount at exit option is used the filesystems will be umounted but the mount will not be re‐
       leased  by the kernel until they are no longer in use by the processes that held them busy.  If automount
       managed filesystems are found mounted when autofs is started they will be recovered unless  they  are  no
       longer present in the map in which case they need to umounted manually.

       If  the  option to disable the check to see if the daemon is already running is used be aware that autofs
       currently may not function correctly for certain types of automount maps. The mounts of the separate dae‐
       mons might interfere with one another. The implications of running multiple daemon instances needs to  be
       checked and tested before we can say this is supported.

       If  the  option to force an unlink of mounts at startup is used then processes whose working directory is
       within unlinked automounted directories will not get the correct pwd from the system.  This  is  because,
       after  the  mount  is unlinked from the mount tree, anything that needs to walk back up the mount tree to
       construct a path, such as <a href="../man2/getcwd.2.html">getcwd</a>(2) and the proc filesystem  <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/cwd,  cannot  work  because  the
       point from which the path is constructed has been detached from the mount tree.
