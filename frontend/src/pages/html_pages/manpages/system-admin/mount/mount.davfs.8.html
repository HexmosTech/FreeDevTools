       mount.davfs - Mount a WebDAV resource as davfs2 file system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mount.davfs</b> <b>[-h</b> <b>|</b> <b>--help]</b> <b>[-V</b> <b>|</b> <b>--version]</b>
       <b>mount</b> <b>{</b><u>dir</u> <b>|</b> <u>webdavserver</u><b>}</b>

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b> <b>(root</b> <b>only)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mount</b> <b>-t</b> <b>davfs</b> <b>[-o</b> <u>option</u><b>[,...]]</b> <u>webdavserver</u> <u>dir</u>
       <b>mount.davfs</b> <b>[-o</b> <u>option</u><b>[,...]]</b> <u>webdavserver</u> <u>dir</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mount.davfs</b>  allows you to mount the WebDAV resource identified by <u>webdavserver</u> into the local filesystem
       at <u>dir.</u>  WebDAV is an extension to HTTP that allows remote, collaborative  authoring  of  Web  resources,
       defined in RFC 4918.  <b>mount.davfs</b> is part of <b>davfs2</b>.

       <b>davfs2</b>  allows  documents on a remote Web server to be edited using standard applications. For example, a
       remote Web site could be updated in-place using the same development tools  that  initially  created  the
       site.   Or  you  may  use  a  WebDAV  resource for documents you want to access and edited from different
       locations.

       <b>davfs2</b> supports <b>TLS/SSL</b> (if the neon library supports it) and proxies. <b>mount.davfs</b> runs as  a  daemon  in
       userspace.  It  integrates  into  the  virtual  file  system  by the fuse kernel files system.  Currently
       FUSE_KERNEL_VERSION 7 is supported.

       <b>mount.davfs</b> is usually invoked by the <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8) command when using the <u>-t</u> <u>davfs</u> option. After mounting  it
       runs as a daemon. To unmount the <b><a href="../man8/umount.8.html">umount</a></b>(8) command is used.

       <u>webdavserver</u>  is  the  URL  of  the  server.  It must at least contain the host name. It may additionally
       contain the scheme, the port and the path.  Missing components are set to sensible  default  values.  The
       path  component must <b>not</b> be %-encoded, but when entering the URL at the command line or in <a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a> the
       escaping rules of the shell or fstab must be obeyed.

       <u>dir</u> is the mountpoint where the WebDAV resource is mounted on.  It may be an absolute or relative path.

       <u>fstab</u> may be used to define mounts and mount options as usual. In place of the  device  the  url  of  the
       WebDAV server must be given. There must not be more than one entry in <u>fstab</u> for every mountpoint.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-V</b> <b>--version</b>
              Output version.

       <b>-h</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print a help message.

       <b>-o</b>     A comma-separated list defines mount options to be used. Available options are:

              <b>[no]auto</b>
                     Can (not) be mounted with <b>mount</b> <b>-a</b>.
                     Default: <b>auto</b>.

              <b>comment=</b><u>some</u> <u>comment</u>
                     This  option  is  ignored by <b>mount.davfs</b> but other programs may require it to be present in
                     fstab.

              <b>conf=</b><u>absolute</u> <u>path</u>
                     An alternative user configuration file. This option is intended for cases where the default
                     user configuration file in the users home directory can not be used.
                     Default: <u><a href="file:~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf">~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf</a></u>

              <b>[no]dev</b>
                     (Do not) interpret character or block  special  devices  on the file system.   This  option
                     is  only  included  for  compatibility  with the <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8) program. It will always be set to
                     <b>nodev</b>

              <b>dir_mode=</b><u>mode</u>
                     The default mode bits for directories in the mounted file system.  Value  given  in  octal.
                     s-bits for user and group are always silently ignored.
                     Default:  calculated  from  the umask of the mounting user; an x-bit is associated to every
                     r-bit in u-g-o.

              <b>[no]exec</b>
                     (Do  not) allow  execution  of any binaries on the mounted file system.
                     Default: <b>exec</b>. (When mounting as an ordinary  user,  the  <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8)  program  will  set  the
                     default to <b>noexec</b>.)

              <b>file_mode=</b><u>mode</u>
                     The  default  mode  bits for files in the mounted file system. Value given in octal. s-bits
                     for user and group are always silently ignored.
                     Default: calculated from the umask of the mounting user; no x-bits are set for files.

              <b>gid=</b><u>group</u>
                     The group the mounted file system belongs to. It may be a numeric ID or a group  name.  The
                     mounting user, if not root, must be member of this group.
                     Default: the primary group of the mounting user.

              <b>[no]grpid</b>
                     When  this  option  is  set a newly created file will take the group id of the directory in
                     which it is created. This will also apply to all files that are on the server  and  not  in
                     the local cache. (That is because the group id is not stored on the server.)
                     If the group id of the directory is <u>root</u> this option is ignored.
                     Default: <b>nogrpid</b>.

              <b>[no]_netdev</b>
                     The  file system needs a (no) network connection for operation. This information allows the
                     operating system to handle the file system properly at system start and when the network is
                     shut down.
                     Default: <b>_netdev</b>

              <b>ro</b>     Mount the file system read-only.
                     Default: <b>rw</b>.

              <b>rw</b>     Mount the file system read-write.
                     Default: <b>rw</b>.

              <b>[no]suid</b>
                     Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take effect.  This  option
                     is only included for compatibility with the mount program. It will always be set to <b>nosuid</b>.

              <b>[no]user</b>
                     (Do not) allow  an  ordinary  user  to mount the file system. The name of the mounting user
                     is  written  to  <u>mtab</u> so that he can unmount the file system again. Option <b>user</b> implies the
                     options <b>noexec</b>, <b>nosuid</b> and <b>nodev</b> (unless  overridden by subsequent  options).  This  option
                     makes only sense when set in <u>fstab</u>.
                     Default: ordinary users are not allowed to mount.

              <b>users</b>  Like  <b>user</b>, but <b>any</b> user is allowed to unmount the file system, not only the mounting user.
                     This is generally not recomended.  If the <b>user</b> option allows an unprivileged user to mount,
                     but unmounting by the mounting user fails the <b>users</b> may be a work around.
                     Default: only the mounting user is allowed to unmount the file system.

              <b>uid=</b><u>user</u>
                     The owner of the mounted file system. It may be a numeric ID or a  user  name.   Only  when
                     mounted by root, this may be different from the mounting user.
                     Default: ID of the mounting user.

              <b>username=</b><u>WebDAV_user</u>
                     Use  this name to authenticate with the WebDAV server. This option is intended for use with
                     pam_mount only. When this option is set the  credentials  in  the  secrets  files  will  be
                     ignored. The password will always be read from stdin, even when option <u>askauth</u> is set to 0.
                     Do not use it in <u>fstab</u>. The username will be visible for everyone in the output of <u>ps</u>.
                     Default: no username.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b> <b>POLICY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mount.davfs</b>  needs root privileges for mounting. But running a daemon, that is connected to the internet,
       with root privileges is a security risk. So <b>mount.davfs</b> will change its uid and gid when entering  daemon
       mode.

              When  invoked by root <b>mount.davfs</b> will run as user <b>davfs2</b> and group <b>davfs2</b>. This may be changed in
              <u>/etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf</u>.

              When invoked by an ordinary user it will run with the id of this user and with group <b>davfs2</b>.

       As the file system may be mounted over an insecure internet connection,  this  increases  the  risk  that
       malicious  content  may  be included in the file system. So <b>mount.davfs</b> is slightly more restrictive than
       <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8).

              Options <b>nosuid</b> and <b>nodev</b> will always be set; even root can not change this.

              For ordinary users to be able to mount, they must be member of group <b>davfs2</b> and there must  be  an
              entry in <u>fstab</u>.

              When  the  mount point given in <u>fstab</u> is a relative file name and the file system is mounted by an
              unprivileged user, the mount point must lie within the home directory of the mounting user.

              If in <u>fstab</u> option <b>uid</b> and/or <b>gid</b> are given, an ordinary user can only mount, if her  uid  is  the
              one given in option <b>uid</b> and he belongs to the group given in option <b>gid</b>.

       <b>WARNING:</b>  If  root  allows  an  ordinary  user  to  mount  a  file system (using <u>fstab</u>) this includes the
       permission to read the associated <b>credentials</b> from <u>/etc/davfs2/secrets</u> as well as the <b>private</b> <b>key</b> of  the
       associated  <b>client</b>  <b>certificate</b> and the mounting user may get access to this information. You should only
       do this, if you might as well give this information to the user directly.

</pre><h4><b>URLS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>MOUNT</b> <b>POINTS</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>SPACES</b></h4><pre>
       Special characters like spaces in pathnames are a mess. They are  interpreted  differently  by  different
       programs and protocols, and there are different rules for escaping.

       In    <u>fstab</u>   spaces   must   be   replaced   by   a   three   digit   octal   escape   sequence.   Write
       <u><a href="http://foo.bar/path">http://foo.bar/path</a>\040with\040spaces</u> instead of <u><a href="http://foo.bar/path">http://foo.bar/path</a></u> <u>with</u> <u>spaces</u>.

       For the <u>davfs2.conf</u> and the <u>secrets</u> files please see the escape and  quotation  rules  described  in  the
       <b><a href="../man5/davfs2.conf.5.html">davfs2.conf</a></b>(5) man page.

       On <u>command</u> <u>line</u> you must obey the escaping rules of the shell.

</pre><h4><b>CACHING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mount.davfs</b>  tries  to reduce HTTP-trafic by caching and reusing data.  Information about directories and
       files are held in memory, while downloaded files are cached on disk.

       <b>mount.davfs</b> needs to hold a local copy of all open files in the cache directory. Please  make  sure  that
       enough local disk space is available.

       <b>mount.davfs</b>  will  consider  cached  information  about  directories  and  file  attributes  valid  for a
       configurable time and look up this information on the server only after this time has expired  (or  there
       is  other  evidence  that this information is stale). So if somebody else creates or deletes files on the
       server it may take some time before the local file system reflects this.

       This will not affect the content of files and directory listings. Whenever a file is opened,  the  server
       is  looked  up  for a newer version of the file.  Please consult the manual <b><a href="../man5/davfs2.conf.5.html">davfs2.conf</a></b>(5) to see how can
       you configure this according your needs.

</pre><h4><b>LOCKS,</b> <b>LOST</b> <b>UPDATE</b> <b>PROBLEM</b> <b>AND</b> <b>BACKUP</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       WebDAV introduced locks and <b>mount.davfs</b> uses them by default. This will in most cases prevent two  people
       from changing the same file in parallel. But not always:

              You might have disabled locks in <u>/etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf</u> or <u><a href="file:~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf">~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf</a></u>.

              The server might not support locks (they are not mandatory).

              A bad connection might prevent <b>mount.davfs</b> from refreshing the lock in time.

              Another WebDAV-client might use your lock (that is not too difficult and might even happen without
              intention).

       <b>mount.davfs</b>  will  therefore check if the file has been changed on the the server before it uploads a new
       version. If it finds it impossible to upload the locally changed file, it will  store  it  in  the  local
       backup direcotry <u>lost+found</u>. You should check this directory from time to time and decide what to do with
       this files.

       Sometimes  locks  held by some client on the server will not be released. Maybe the client crashes or the
       network connection fails. When <b>mount.davfs</b> finds a file locked on the server, it will check  whether  the
       lock  is held by <b>mount.davfs</b> and the current user, and if so tries to reuse and release it. But this will
       not always succeed. So servers should automatically release locks after some  time,  when  they  are  not
       refreshed by the client.

       WebDAV  allows  one to lock files that don't exist (to protect the name when a client intends to create a
       new file). This locks will be displayed as files with size 0 and last modified  date  of  1970-01-01.  If
       this  locks  are  not  released  properly  <b>mount.davfs</b>  may not be able to access this files. You can use
       <b><a href="../man1/cadaver.1.html">cadaver</a></b>(1) &lt;<u><a href="http://www.webdav.org/cadaver/">http://www.webdav.org/cadaver/</a></u>&gt; to remove this locks.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>OWNER</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PERMISSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>davfs2</b> implements Unix permissions for access control. But changing owner and permissions of  a  file  is
       only  <b>local</b>.  It  is intended as a means for the owner of the file system, to control whether other local
       users may acces this file system.

       The server does not know about this. From the servers point of view there is just one user (identified by
       the credentials) connected. Another WebDAV-client, connected to the same server, is not affected by  this
       local changes.

       There  is  one exception: The <b>execute</b> <b>bit</b> on files is stored as a property on the sever. You may think of
       this property as an information about the type of file rather than a  permission.  Whether  the  file  is
       executable on the local system is still controlled by mount options and local permissions.

       When  the  file  system  is  unmounted,  attributes of cached files (including owner and permissions) are
       stored in cache, as well as the attributs of the direcotries they are in. But  there  is  no  information
       stored about directories that do not contain cached files.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf</u>
              System wide configuration file.

       <u><a href="file:~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf">~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf</a></u>
              Configuration  file  in  the users home directory.The user configuration takes precedence over the
              system wide configuration. If it does not exist, <b>mount.davfs</b> will will create a template file.

       <u>/etc/davfs2/secrets</u>
              Holds the credentials for WebDAV servers and the proxy, as well as decryption passwords for client
              certificates. The file must be read-writable by root only.

       <u><a href="file:~/.davfs2/secrets">~/.davfs2/secrets</a></u>
              Holds credentials for WebDAV servers and  proxy,  as  well  as  decryption  passwords  for  client
              certificates. The file must be read-writable by the owner only. Credentials are first looked up in
              the  home  directory  of  the  mounting  user.  If not found there the system wide secrets file is
              consulted. If no creditentials and passwords are found they are asked from the user  interactively
              (if not disabled). If the file does not exist, <b>mount.davfs</b> will will create a template file.

       <u>/etc/davfs2/certs</u>
              You may store trusted server certificates here, that can not be verified by use of the system wide
              CA-Certificates.  This  is useful when your server uses a selfmade certificate. You must configure
              the <b>servercert</b> option in <u>/etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf</u> or <u><a href="file:~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf">~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf</a></u> to use it.  Certificates
              must be in PEM format.
              Be sure to verify the certificate.

       <u><a href="file:~/.davfs2/certs">~/.davfs2/certs</a></u>
              You may store trusted server certificates here, that can not be verified by use of the system wide
              CA-Certificates.  This  is useful when your server uses a selfmade certificate. You must configure
              the <b>servercert</b> option in <u><a href="file:~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf">~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf</a></u> to use it. Certificates must be in PEM format.
              Be sure to verify the certificate.

       <u>/etc/davfs2/certs/private</u>
              To store client certificates. Certificates must be in  PKCS#12  format.  You  must  configure  the
              <b>clientcert</b>  option  in  <u>/etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf</u> or <u><a href="file:~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf">~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf</a></u> to use it. This directory
              must be rwx by root only.

       <u><a href="file:~/.davfs2/certs/private">~/.davfs2/certs/private</a></u>
              To store client certificates. Certificates must be in  PKCS#12  format.  You  must  configure  the
              <b>clientcert</b>  option  in  <u><a href="file:~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf">~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf</a></u>  to  use it. This directory must be rwx by the owner
              only.

       <u>/var/run/mount.davfs</u>
              PID-files of running mount.davfs processes are stored there. This directory must belong  to  group
              <b>davfs2</b>  with write permissions for the group and the sticky-bit set (mode 1775). The PID-files are
              named after the mount point of the file system.

       <u>/var/cache/davfs2</u>
              System wide directory for cached files. Used when the file system is  mounted  by  root.  It  must
              belong  do  group  <b>davfs2</b>  and  read,  write  and  execute  bits for group must be set. There is a
              subdirectory for every mounted file system. The names of this subdirectories are created from url,
              mount point and user name.

       <u><a href="file:~/.davfs2/cache">~/.davfs2/cache</a></u>
              Cache directory in the mounting  users  home  directory.  For  every  mounted  WebDAV  resource  a
              subdirectory is created.

       <b>mount.davfs</b> will try to create missing directories, but it will <b>not</b> touch <u>/etc/davfs2</u>.

              Only used when the mounting user is root.

       <b>no_proxy</b>
              A comma separated list of domain names that shall be accessed  directly.   <b>*</b>  matches  any  domain
              name. A domain name starting with <b>.</b>  (period) matches all subdomains.
              Only used when the mounting user is root.
              Not applied when the proxy is defined in <u>/etc/davfs2</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Non</b> <b>root</b> <b>user</b> <b>(e.g.</b> <b>filomena):</b>

       To allow an ordinary user to mount there must be an entry in <u>fstab</u>
              <a href="http://webdav.org/dav">http://webdav.org/dav</a>   /media/dav   davfs   noauto,user   0   0

       If a proxy must be used this should be configured in <u>/etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf</u>
              proxy   proxy.mycompany.com:8080

       Credentials are stored in <u>/home/filomena/.davfs2/secrets</u>
              proxy.mycompany.com     filomena  "my secret"
              /media/dav   webdav-username   password

       If you have two-factor authentication enabled and if you can provide the token together with the password
       in the form of password:token, then add the string '2FA' as the forth parameter and you will be asked for
       token during mounting.
              /media/dav   user-name   "p@ss\"w0rd" 2FA

       Now the WebDAV resource may be mounted by user filomena invoking
              <b>mount</b> <b>/media/dav</b>

       and unmounted by user filomena invoking
              <b>umount</b> <b>/media/dav</b>

       <b>Root</b> <b>user</b> <b>only:</b>

       Mounts  the resource <u>https://asciigirl.com/webdav</u> at mount point <u>/mount/site</u>, encrypting all traffic with
       SSL. Credentials for <u><a href="http://webdav.org/dav">http://webdav.org/dav</a></u> will be looked up in <u>/etc/davfs2/secrets</u>, if not  found  there
       the user will be asked.
              <b>mount</b> <b>-t</b> <b>davfs</b> <b>-o</b> <b>uid=otto,gid=users,mode=775</b> <b>https://asciigirl.com/webdav</b> <b>/mount/site</b>

       Mounts the resource <u><a href="http://linux.org.ar/repos">http://linux.org.ar/repos</a></u> at <u>/dav</u>.
              <b>mount.davfs</b> <b>-o</b> <b>uid=otto,gid=users,mode=775</b> <b><a href="http://linux.org.ar/repos/">http://linux.org.ar/repos/</a></b> <b>/dav</b>
