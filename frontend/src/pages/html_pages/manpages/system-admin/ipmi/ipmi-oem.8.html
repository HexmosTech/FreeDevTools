       ipmi-oem - IPMI OEM utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ipmi-oem</b> [<u>OPTION</u>...] &lt;<u>OEMID</u>&gt; &lt;<u>OEMCOMMAND</u>&gt; [<u>OEMOPTION</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Ipmi-oem</b> is used to execute OEM specific IPMI commands. It is intended to provide a better user interface
       for  OEM specific IPMI commands rather than using <b><a href="../man8/ipmi-raw.8.html">ipmi-raw</a>(8).</b>  Please see SUPPORTED OEM IDS and COMMANDS
       below for a list of supported OEM specific IPMI commands. A list of supported OEM specific  commands  may
       also be generated using the <b>--list</b> option.  There are no guarantees that the below OEM commands will work
       on  any  particular  motherboard.  OEM  extensions  may or may not exist on particular hardware revisions
       and/or firmware revisions of motherboards. The extensions may or may not  function  for  other  lines  of
       motherboards from the same manufacturer.

       Listed  below  are  general IPMI options, tool specific options, trouble shooting information, workaround
       information, examples, and known issues. For a general introduction to FreeIPMI please see <b><a href="../man7/freeipmi.7.html">freeipmi</a>(7).</b>

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are general options for configuring IPMI communication and executing  general  tool
       commands.

       <b>-D</b> <u>IPMIDRIVER</u>, <b>--driver-type</b>=<u>IPMIDRIVER</u>
              Specify  the  driver  type  to  use  instead  of doing an auto selection.  The currently available
              outofband drivers are LAN and LAN_2_0, which perform IPMI  1.5  and  IPMI  2.0  respectively.  The
              currently available inband drivers are KCS, SSIF, OPENIPMI, SUNBMC, and INTELDCMI.

       <b>--disable-auto-probe</b>
              Do not probe in-band IPMI devices for default settings.

       <b>--driver-address</b>=<u>DRIVER-ADDRESS</u>
              Specify  the  in-band driver address to be used instead of the probed value. <u>DRIVER-ADDRESS</u> should
              be prefixed with "0x" for a hex value and '0' for an octal value.

       <b>--driver-device</b>=<u>DEVICE</u>
              Specify the in-band driver device path to be used instead of the probed path.

       <b>--register-spacing</b>=<u>REGISTER-SPACING</u>
              Specify the in-band driver register spacing instead of the probed  value.  Argument  is  in  bytes
              (i.e. 32bit register spacing = 4)

       <b>--target-channel-number</b>=<u>CHANNEL-NUMBER</u>
              Specify the in-band driver target channel number to send IPMI requests to.

       <b>--target-slave-address</b>=<u>SLAVE-ADDRESS</u>

       <b>-h</b> <u>IPMIHOST1,IPMIHOST2,...</u>, <b>--hostname</b>=<u>IPMIHOST1[:PORT],IPMIHOST2[:PORT],...</u>
              Specify  the  remote  host(s) to communicate with. Multiple hostnames may be separated by comma or
              may be specified in a range format;  see  HOSTRANGED  SUPPORT  below.  An  optional  port  can  be
              specified  with  each  host,  which  may  be  useful in port forwarding or similar situations.  If
              specifying an IPv6 address and port, use the format [ADDRESS]:PORT.

       <b>-u</b> <u>USERNAME</u>, <b>--username</b>=<u>USERNAME</u>
              Specify the username to use when authenticating with the remote host.  If not  specified,  a  null
              (i.e.  anonymous) username is assumed. The required user privilege will depend on the oem commands
              executed.

       <b>-p</b> <u>PASSWORD</u>, <b>--password</b>=<u>PASSWORD</u>
              Specify the password to use when authenticationg with the remote host.  If not specified,  a  null
              password is assumed. Maximum password length is 16 for IPMI 1.5 and 20 for IPMI 2.0.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--password-prompt</b>
              Prompt for password to avoid possibility of listing it in process lists.

       <b>-k</b> <u>K_G</u>, <b>--k-g</b>=<u>K_G</u>
              Specify  the  K_g  BMC  key  to  use when authenticating with the remote host for IPMI 2.0. If not
              specified, a null key is assumed. To input the key in hexadecimal form,  prefix  the  string  with
              '0x'. E.g., the key 'abc' can be entered with the either the string 'abc' or the string '0x616263'

       <b>-K</b>, <b>--k-g-prompt</b>
              Prompt for k-g to avoid possibility of listing it in process lists.

       <b>--session-timeout</b>=<u>MILLISECONDS</u>
              Specify  the  session  timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 20000 milliseconds (20 seconds) if not
              specified.

       <b>--retransmission-timeout</b>=<u>MILLISECONDS</u>
              Specify the packet retransmission timeout  in  milliseconds.  Defaults  to  1000  milliseconds  (1
              second) if not specified. The retransmission timeout cannot be larger than the session timeout.

       <b>-a</b> <u>AUTHENTICATION-TYPE</u>, <b>--authentication-type</b>=<u>AUTHENTICATION-TYPE</u>
              Specify  the IPMI 1.5 authentication type to use. The currently available authentication types are
              NONE, STRAIGHT_PASSWORD_KEY, MD2, and MD5. Defaults to MD5 if not specified.

       <b>-I</b> <u>CIPHER-SUITE-ID</u>, <b>--cipher-suite-id</b>=<u>CIPHER-SUITE-ID</u>
              Specify the IPMI  2.0  cipher  suite  ID  to  use.  The  Cipher  Suite  ID  identifies  a  set  of
              authentication,  integrity,  and confidentiality algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0 communication. The
              authentication algorithm identifies  the  algorithm  to  use  for  session  setup,  the  integrity
              algorithm  identifies  the algorithm to use for session packet signatures, and the confidentiality
              algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher suite ID 3 if
              not specified. The following cipher suite ids are currently supported:

              0 - Authentication Algorithm = None; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None

              1 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm  =
              None

</pre><h4><b>SDR</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This  tool  requires  access to the sensor data repository (SDR) cache for general operation. By default,
       SDR data will be downloaded and cached on the local machine. The  following  options  apply  to  the  SDR
       cache.

       <b>--flush-cache</b>
              Flush  a cached version of the sensor data repository (SDR) cache. The SDR is typically cached for
              faster subsequent access. However, it may need to be flushed and re-generated if the SDR has  been
              updated on a system.

       <b>--quiet-cache</b>
              Do not output information about cache creation/deletion. May be useful in scripting.

       <b>--sdr-cache-recreate</b>
              If  the  SDR  cache  is  out of date or invalid, automatically recreate the sensor data repository
              (SDR) cache. This option may be useful for scripting purposes.

       <b>--sdr-cache-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Specify a specific sensor data repository (SDR) cache file to be stored  or  read  from.  If  this
              option  is  used  when  multiple hosts are specified, the same SDR cache file will be used for all
              hosts.

       <b>--sdr-cache-directory</b>=<u>DIRECTORY</u>
              Specify an alternate directory for sensor data repository (SDR) caches to be stored or read  from.
              Defaults to the home directory if not specified.

</pre><h4><b>TIME</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       By  IPMI  definition, all IPMI times and timestamps are stored in localtime. However, in many situations,
       the timestamps will not be stored in localtime. Whether or not a system truly stored  the  timestamps  in
       localtime  varies on many factors, such as the vendor, BIOS, and operating system.  The following options
       will allow the user to adjust the interpretation of the stored timestamps and how they should be output.

       <b>--utc-to-localtime</b>
              Assume all times are reported in UTC time and convert the time to localtime before being output.

       <b>--localtime-to-utc</b>
              Convert all localtime timestamps to UTC before being output.

       <b>--utc-offset</b>=<u>SECONDS</u>
              Specify a specific UTC offset in seconds to be added to timestamps.  Value can range  from  -86400
              to 86400 seconds. Defaults to 0.

</pre><h4><b>HOSTRANGED</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  options  manipulate  hostranged  output.  See  HOSTRANGED  SUPPORT  below  for additional
       information on hostranges.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--buffer-output</b>
              Buffer hostranged output. For each node, buffer standard output until the node has  completed  its
              IPMI  operation.  When  specifying this option, data may appear to output slower to the user since
              the the entire IPMI operation must complete before any data can be output.  See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT
              below for additional information.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--consolidate-output</b>
              Consolidate hostranged output. The complete standard output from  every  node  specified  will  be
              consolidated  so  that  nodes with identical output are not output twice. A header will list those
              nodes with the consolidated output. When this option is specified, no output can be seen until the
              IPMI operations to all nodes has completed. If the user breaks  out  of  the  program  early,  all
              currently  consolidated  output  will  be  dumped.  See  HOSTRANGED  SUPPORT  below for additional
              information.

       <b>-F</b> <u>NUM</u>, <b>--fanout</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              Specify multiple host fanout. A "sliding window" (or fanout) algorithm is used for  parallel  IPMI
              communication  so that slower nodes or timed out nodes will not impede parallel communication. The
              maximum number of threads available at the same time is limited by the fanout. The default is 64.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--eliminate</b>
              Eliminate hosts determined as undetected by <b>ipmidetect.</b>  This attempts to remove the common  issue
              of  hostranged  execution  timing  out  due to several nodes being removed from service in a large
              cluster. The <b>ipmidetectd</b> daemon must be running on the node executing the command.

       <b>--always-prefix</b>
              Always prefix output, even if only one host is specified or communicating in-band. This option  is
              primarily useful for scripting purposes. Option will be ignored if specified with the <b>-C</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>IPMI-OEM</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are specific to <b>ipmi-oem.</b>

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--list</b>
              List supported OEM IDs and Commands.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Output  verbose  information.  Additional  output  will depend on specific OEM ID and OEM COMMANDS
              specified.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>OEM</b> <b>IDS</b> <b>and</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The currently supported OEM IDs and COMMANDs are listed below. The special OEM ID of <b>list</b> may  be  passed
       into  the  list all supported OEM IDs and Commands. The special OEM command <b>list</b> may be passed to any OEM
       ID to list commands supported by that OEM ID.

</pre><h4><b>HOSTRANGED</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Multiple  hosts can be input either as an explicit comma separated lists of hosts or a range of hostnames
       in the general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n &lt; m and l &lt; k,  etc.  The  later  form  should  not  be
       confused  with  regular  expression character classes (also denoted by []). For example, foo[19] does not
       represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a degenerate range: foo19.

       This range syntax is meant only as a convenience on  clusters  with  a  prefixNN  naming  convention  and
       specification  of  ranges  should not be considered necessary -- the list foo1,foo9 could be specified as
       such, or by the range foo[1,9].

       Some examples of range usage follow:
           foo[01-05] instead of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05
           foo[7,9-10] instead of foo7,foo9,foo10
           foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3

       As a reminder to the reader, some shells  will  interpret  brackets  ([  and  ])  for  pattern  matching.
       Depending on your shell, it may be necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.

       When  multiple hosts are specified by the user, a thread will be executed for each host in parallel up to
       the configured fanout (which can be adjusted via the <b>-F</b> option). This will allow communication  to  large
       numbers of nodes far more quickly than if done in serial.

       By  default,  standard output from each node specified will be output with the hostname prepended to each
       line. Although this output is readable in  many  situations,  it  may  be  difficult  to  read  in  other
       situations.  For  example, output from multiple nodes may be mixed together. The <b>-B</b> and <b>-C</b> options can be
       used to change this default.

       In-band IPMI Communication will be used when the host "localhost" is specified. This allows the  user  to
       add the localhost into the hostranged output.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       Most often, IPMI problems are due to configuration problems.

       IPMI over LAN problems involve a misconfiguration of the remote machine's BMC.  Double check to make sure
       the  following are configured properly in the remote machine's BMC: IP address, MAC address, subnet mask,
       username, user  enablement,  user  privilege,  password,  LAN  privilege,  LAN  enablement,  and  allowed
       authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0 connections, double check to make sure the cipher suite privilege(s)
       and  K_g  key  are  configured properly. The <b><a href="../man8/ipmi-config.8.html">ipmi-config</a>(8)</b> tool can be used to check and/or change these
       configuration settings.

       Inband IPMI problems are typically caused by improperly configured drivers or non-standard BMCs.

       In addition to the troubleshooting tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below to  also  if  there  are  any
       vendor specific bugs that have been discovered and worked around.

       Listed below are many of the common issues for error messages.  For additional support, please e-mail the
       &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt; mailing list.

       "username  invalid"  -  The username entered (or a NULL username if none was entered) is not available on
       the remote machine. It may also be possible the remote BMC's username configuration is incorrect.

       "password invalid" - The password entered (or a NULL password if none was entered) is not correct. It may
       also be possible the password for the user is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "password verification timeout" - Password verification  has  timed  out.   A  "password  invalid"  error
       (described  above)  or  a generic "session timeout" (described below) occurred.  During this point in the
       protocol it cannot be differentiated which occurred.

       "k_g invalid" - The K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was entered) is not correct. It  may  also
       be possible the K_g key is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "privilege  level  insufficient"  -  An  IPMI  command  requires  a  higher  user  privilege than the one
       authenticated with. Please try to authenticate with a higher privilege. This may  require  authenticating
       to a different user which has a higher maximum privilege.

       "privilege  level  cannot  be  obtained  for  this  user"  -  The  privilege  level you are attempting to
       authenticate with is higher than the maximum allowed for  this  user.  Please  try  again  with  a  lower
       privilege.  It  may  also  be  possible  the maximum privilege level allowed for a user is not configured
       properly on the remote BMC.

       "authentication type unavailable for attempted privilege level" - The authentication  type  you  wish  to
       authenticate  with  is  not  available  for  this  privilege  level.  Please  try again with an alternate
       authentication type or alternate privilege level. It may also be possible  the  available  authentication
       types you can authenticate with are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "cipher suite id unavailable" - The cipher suite id you wish to authenticate with is not available on the
       remote  BMC.  Please  try  again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may also be possible the available
       cipher suite ids are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "ipmi 2.0 unavailable" - IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote machine. Please try to  use  IPMI  1.5
       instead.

       "connection  timeout"  -  Initial  IPMI  communication failed. A number of potential errors are possible,
       including an invalid hostname specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be resolved, IPMI is  not  enabled  on
       the remote server, the network connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration and connectivity.

       "session  timeout"  -  The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect.  If this error occurs often, you
       may wish to increase the retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are considerably slower than others.

       "device not found" - The specified device could not be found. Please check configuration  or  inputs  and
       try again.

       "driver timeout" - Communication with the driver or device has timed out. Please try again.

       "message timeout" - Communication with the driver or device has timed out. Please try again.

       "BMC  busy"  -  The BMC is currently busy. It may be processing information or have too many simultaneous
       sessions to manage. Please wait and try again.

       "could not find inband device" - An inband device could not be  found.   Please  check  configuration  or
       specify specific device or driver on the command line.

       "driver  timeout"  - The inband driver has timed out communicating to the local BMC or service processor.
       The BMC or service processor may be busy or (worst case) possibly non-functioning.

</pre><h4><b>WORKAROUNDS</b></h4><pre>
       With so many different vendors implementing their own IPMI solutions,  different  vendors  may  implement
       their  IPMI protocols incorrectly. The following describes a number of workarounds currently available to
       handle discovered compliance issues. When possible, workarounds have been implemented  so  they  will  be
       transparent  to  the user. However, some will require the user to specify a workaround be used via the -W
       option.

       The hardware listed below may only indicate the hardware that a problem was discovered on. Newer versions
       of hardware may fix the problems indicated below. Similar machines from vendors may or  may  not  exhibit
       the same problems. Different vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI firmware developer, so
       it may be worthwhile to try workarounds listed below even if your motherboard is not listed.

       If  you  believe  your  hardware  has  an  additional  compliance  issue  that  needs  a workaround to be
       implemented,   please   contact    the    FreeIPMI    maintainers    on    &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt;    or
       &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-devel@gnu.org">freeipmi-devel@gnu.org</a>&gt;.

       <u>assumeio</u>  -  This  workaround  flag will assume inband interfaces communicate with system I/O rather than
       being memory-mapped. This will work around systems that report invalid base addresses. Those hitting this
       issue may see "device not supported" or "could not find inband device"  errors.   Issue  observed  on  HP
       ProLiant DL145 G1.

       <u>spinpoll</u>  -  This  workaround  flag will inform some inband drivers (most notably the KCS driver) to spin
       while polling rather than putting the process to sleep. This may significantly  improve  the  wall  clock
       running  time  of  tools  because an operating system scheduler's granularity may be much larger than the
       time it takes to perform a single IPMI message transaction. However, by  spinning,  your  system  may  be
       performing less useful work by not contexting out the tool for a more useful task.

       <u>authcap</u>  -  This  workaround  flag  will  skip  early  checks  for  username capabilities, authentication
       capabilities, and K_g support and allow IPMI authentication to succeed. It works around  multiple  issues
       in  which  the remote system does not properly report username capabilities, authentication capabilities,
       or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may see "username invalid", "authentication type unavailable  for
       attempted  privilege  level",  or "k_g invalid" errors.  Issue observed on Asus P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4,
       Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.

       <u>nochecksumcheck</u> - This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the checksums returned  from  IPMI
       command  responses.  It  works around systems that return invalid checksums due to implementation errors,
       but the packet is otherwise valid. Users are  cautioned  on  the  use  of  this  option,  as  it  removes
       validation  of  packet  integrity in a number of circumstances. However, it is unlikely to be an issue in
       most situations. Those hitting this issue may see "connection timeout", "session timeout",  or  "password
       verification  timeout"  errors. On IPMI 1.5 connections, the "noauthcodecheck" workaround may also needed
       too. Issue observed on Supermicro X9SCM-iiF, Supermicro X9DRi-F, and Supermicro X9DRFR.

       <u>idzero</u> - This workaround flag will allow empty session IDs to be accepted by the client. It works  around
       IPMI  sessions  that  report  empty  session IDs to the client. Those hitting this issue may see "session
       timeout" errors. Issue observed on Tyan S2882 with M3289 BMC.

       <u>unexpectedauth</u> - This workaround flag will allow unexpected non-null authcodes to be  checked  as  though
       they  were expected. It works around an issue when packets contain non-null authentication data when they
       should be null due to disabled per-message authentication. Those hitting  this  issue  may  see  "session
       timeout" errors. Issue observed on Dell PowerEdge 2850,SC1425. Confirmed fixed on newer firmware.

       <u>forcepermsg</u>  -  This  workaround  flag will force per-message authentication to be used no matter what is
       advertised by the remote system. It works around an issue when per-message authentication  is  advertised
       as  disabled on the remote system, but it is actually required for the protocol. Those hitting this issue
       may see "session timeout" errors.  Issue observed on IBM eServer 325.

       <u>endianseq</u> - This workaround flag will flip the endian of  the  session  sequence  numbers  to  allow  the
       session  to  continue  properly.  It  works  around  IPMI 1.5 session sequence numbers that are the wrong
       endian.  Those hitting this issue may see "session timeout" errors.  Issue  observed  on  some  Sun  ILOM
       1.0/2.0 (depends on service processor endian).

       <u>noauthcodecheck</u>  - This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the authentication codes returned
       from IPMI 1.5 command responses. It works around systems that return invalid authentication codes due  to
       hashing  or  implementation  errors.  Users  are  cautioned  on  the use of this option, as it removes an
       authentication check verifying the validity of a packet. However, in most organizations, this is unlikely
       to be a security issue. Those hitting this issue may see  "connection  timeout",  "session  timeout",  or
       "password  verification  timeout"  errors.   Issue observed on Xyratex FB-H8-SRAY, Intel Windmill, Quanta
       Winterfell, and Wiwynn Windmill.

       <u>intel20</u> - This workaround flag will work around several Intel IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The  issues
       covered  include  padding  of usernames, and password truncation if the authentication algorithm is HMAC-
       MD5-128. Those hitting this issue may see  "username  invalid",  "password  invalid",  or  "k_g  invalid"
       errors. Issue observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module (Professional Edition).

       <u>supermicro20</u> - This workaround flag will work around several Supermicro IPMI 2.0 authentication issues on
       motherboards   w/   Peppercon   IPMI  firmware.  The  issues  covered  include  handling  invalid  length
       authentication codes. Those hitting this issue may see "password  invalid"  errors.   Issue  observed  on
       Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card. Confirmed fixed on newerver firmware.

       <u>sun20</u> - This workaround flag will work work around several Sun IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The issues
       covered  include  invalid  lengthed  hash keys, improperly hashed keys, and invalid cipher suite records.
       Those hitting this issue may see "password invalid" or "bmc error" errors.  Issue observed  on  Sun  Fire
       4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.  This workaround automatically includes the "opensesspriv" workaround.

       <u>opensesspriv</u>  -  This  workaround  flag  will  slightly  alter FreeIPMI's IPMI 2.0 connection protocol to
       workaround an invalid hashing algorithm used by the remote system. The privilege level  sent  during  the
       Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0 connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege level sent
       during  the  RAKP1  connection stage. Those hitting this issue may see "password invalid", "k_g invalid",
       "bad rmcpplus status code", or "privilege level cannot be obtained for this user" errors.  Issue observed
       on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Supermicro X8DTH,  Supermicro  X8DTG,
       Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN, Dell C5220,
       and the OpenIPMI software BMC. This workaround is automatically triggered with the "sun20" workaround.

       <u>integritycheckvalue</u>  -  This  workaround flag will work around an invalid integrity check value during an
       IPMI 2.0 session establishment when using Cipher Suite ID 0.  The  integrity  check  value  should  be  0
       length,  however the remote motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting this issue may see
       "k_g invalid" errors. Issue observed on Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU,  and  Intel  S5500WBV/Penguin
       Relion 700, and Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X.

       <u>assumemaxsdrrecordcount</u>  -  This workaround will inform SDR reading to stop reading after a known maximum
       number of SDR records have been read. This will  work  around  systems  that  have  miss-implemented  SDR
       reading  functions. Those hitting this issue may see "SDR record count invalid" errors. Issue observed on
       unspecified Inspur motherboard.

       No IPMI 1.5 Support - Some motherboards that support IPMI 2.0 have been found to not  support  IPMI  1.5.
       Those hitting this issue may see "ipmi 2.0 unavailable" or "connection timeout" errors. This issue can be
       worked  around  by using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by specifying <b>--driver-type</b>=<u>LAN_2_0</u>. Issue observed
       on a number of HP and Supermicro motherboards.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful execution, exit status is 0. On error, exit status is 1.

       If multiple hosts are specified for communication, the exit status is  0  if  and  only  if  all  targets
       successfully execute. Otherwise the exit status is 1.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       On older operating systems, if you input your username, password, and other potentially security relevant
       information  on the command line, this information may be discovered by other users when using tools like
       the <b><a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a>(1)</b> command or looking in the <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> file system. It is generally  more  secure  to  input  password
       information  with  options  like  the  -P or -K options. Configuring security relevant information in the
       FreeIPMI configuration file would also be an appropriate way to hide this information.

       In order to prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will temporarily "lock up" after a  number  of  remote
       authentication  errors.  You  may need to wait awhile in order to this temporary "lock up" to pass before
       you may authenticate again.
