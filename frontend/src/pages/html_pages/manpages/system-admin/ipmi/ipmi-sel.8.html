       ipmi-sel - display SEL entries

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ipmi-sel</b> [<u>OPTION</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Ipmi-sel</b>  is  used  to  view  and  manage  System Event Log (SEL) entries. SEL records store system event
       information and may be useful for debugging problems.  <b>Ipmi-sel</b> does not inform the user if an  event  is
       particularly  good  or  bad, just that the event occurred. Users may wish to use the <b>--output-event-state</b>
       option to output the analyzed state.

       Listed below are general IPMI options, tool specific options, trouble  shooting  information,  workaround
       information,  examples,  and known issues. For a general introduction to FreeIPMI please see <b><a href="../man7/freeipmi.7.html">freeipmi</a>(7).</b>
       To perform some advanced SEL management, please see <b><a href="../man8/bmc-device.8.html">bmc-device</a>(8).</b>

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are general options for configuring IPMI communication and executing  general  tool
       commands.

       <b>-D</b> <u>IPMIDRIVER</u>, <b>--driver-type</b>=<u>IPMIDRIVER</u>
              Specify  the  driver  type  to  use  instead  of doing an auto selection.  The currently available
              outofband drivers are LAN and LAN_2_0, which perform IPMI  1.5  and  IPMI  2.0  respectively.  The
              currently available inband drivers are KCS, SSIF, OPENIPMI, SUNBMC, and INTELDCMI.

       <b>--disable-auto-probe</b>
              Do not probe in-band IPMI devices for default settings.

       <b>--driver-address</b>=<u>DRIVER-ADDRESS</u>
              Specify  the  in-band driver address to be used instead of the probed value. <u>DRIVER-ADDRESS</u> should
              be prefixed with "0x" for a hex value and '0' for an octal value.

       <b>--driver-device</b>=<u>DEVICE</u>
              Specify the in-band driver device path to be used instead of the probed path.

       <b>--register-spacing</b>=<u>REGISTER-SPACING</u>
              Specify the in-band driver register spacing instead of the probed  value.  Argument  is  in  bytes
              (i.e. 32bit register spacing = 4)

       <b>--target-channel-number</b>=<u>CHANNEL-NUMBER</u>
              Specify the in-band driver target channel number to send IPMI requests to.

       <b>--target-slave-address</b>=<u>SLAVE-ADDRESS</u>
              Specify the in-band driver target slave number to send IPMI requests to.

       <b>-h</b> <u>IPMIHOST1,IPMIHOST2,...</u>, <b>--hostname</b>=<u>IPMIHOST1[:PORT],IPMIHOST2[:PORT],...</u>
              Specify  the  remote  host(s) to communicate with. Multiple hostnames may be separated by comma or
              may be specified in a range format;  see  HOSTRANGED  SUPPORT  below.  An  optional  port  can  be
              specified  with  each  host,  which  may  be  useful in port forwarding or similar situations.  If
              specifying an IPv6 address and port, use the format [ADDRESS]:PORT.

       <b>-u</b> <u>USERNAME</u>, <b>--username</b>=<u>USERNAME</u>
              Specify the username to use when authenticating with the remote host.  If not  specified,  a  null
              (i.e. anonymous) username is assumed. The user must have atleast USER privileges in order for this
              tool to operate fully.

       <b>-p</b> <u>PASSWORD</u>, <b>--password</b>=<u>PASSWORD</u>
              Specify  the  password to use when authenticationg with the remote host.  If not specified, a null
              password is assumed. Maximum password length is 16 for IPMI 1.5 and 20 for IPMI 2.0.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--password-prompt</b>
              Prompt for password to avoid possibility of listing it in process lists.

       <b>-k</b> <u>K_G</u>, <b>--k-g</b>=<u>K_G</u>
              Specify the K_g BMC key to use when authenticating with the remote  host  for  IPMI  2.0.  If  not
              specified,  a  null  key  is assumed. To input the key in hexadecimal form, prefix the string with
              '0x'. E.g., the key 'abc' can be entered with the either the string 'abc' or the string '0x616263'

       <b>-K</b>, <b>--k-g-prompt</b>
              Prompt for k-g to avoid possibility of listing it in process lists.

       <b>--session-timeout</b>=<u>MILLISECONDS</u>
              Specify the session timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 20000 milliseconds (20  seconds)  if  not
              specified.

       <b>--retransmission-timeout</b>=<u>MILLISECONDS</u>
              Specify  the  packet  retransmission  timeout  in  milliseconds.  Defaults to 1000 milliseconds (1
              second) if not specified. The retransmission timeout cannot be larger than the session timeout.

       <b>-a</b> <u>AUTHENTICATION-TYPE</u>, <b>--authentication-type</b>=<u>AUTHENTICATION-TYPE</u>
              Specify the IPMI 1.5 authentication type to use. The currently available authentication types  are
              NONE, STRAIGHT_PASSWORD_KEY, MD2, and MD5. Defaults to MD5 if not specified.

       <b>-I</b> <u>CIPHER-SUITE-ID</u>, <b>--cipher-suite-id</b>=<u>CIPHER-SUITE-ID</u>
              Specify  the  IPMI  2.0  cipher  suite  ID  to  use.  The  Cipher  Suite  ID  identifies  a set of
              authentication, integrity, and confidentiality algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0  communication.  The
              authentication  algorithm  identifies  the  algorithm  to  use  for  session  setup, the integrity
              algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for session packet signatures, and  the  confidentiality
              algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher suite ID 3 if
              not specified. The following cipher suite ids are currently supported:

              0 - Authentication Algorithm = None; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None

              1  - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm =
              None

              2 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1;  Integrity  Algorithm  =  HMAC-SHA1-96;  Confidentiality
              Algorithm = None

              3  -  Authentication  Algorithm  =  HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality
              Algorithm = AES-CBC-128

              6 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality  Algorithm  =
              None

              7  -  Authentication  Algorithm  =  HMAC-MD5;  Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality
              Algorithm = None

              8 - Authentication Algorithm =  HMAC-MD5;  Integrity  Algorithm  =  HMAC-MD5-128;  Confidentiality
              Algorithm = AES-CBC-128

              11 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm
              = None

              12 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm
              = AES-CBC-128

              15 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA256; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm
              = None

              16   -   Authentication   Algorithm   =   HMAC-SHA256;   Integrity  Algorithm  =  HMAC_SHA256_128;
              Confidentiality Algorithm = None

              17  -  Authentication  Algorithm   =   HMAC-SHA256;   Integrity   Algorithm   =   HMAC_SHA256_128;
              Confidentiality Algorithm = AES-CBC-128

       <b>-l</b> <u>PRIVILEGE-LEVEL</u>, <b>--privilege-level</b>=<u>PRIVILEGE-LEVEL</u>
              Specify  the  privilege  level  to  be  used.  The  currently available privilege levels are USER,
              OPERATOR, and ADMIN. Defaults to OPERATOR if not specified.

       <b>--config-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Specify an alternate configuration file.

       <b>-W</b> <u>WORKAROUNDS</u>, <b>--workaround-flags</b>=<u>WORKAROUNDS</u>
              Specify workarounds to vendor compliance issues. Multiple workarounds can be  specified  separated
              by  commas. A special command line flag of "none", will indicate no workarounds (may be useful for
              overriding configured defaults). See WORKAROUNDS below for a list of available workarounds.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Turn on debugging.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Output a help list and exit.

       <b>--usage</b>
              Output a usage message and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Output the program version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>IPMI-SEL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are specific to <b>ipmi-sel.</b>

       <b>-v</b>     Output verbose output. This option will output event direction.  Event direction may be useful  to
              differentiate severity between some events. For example, some motherboards may issue an event both
              when a temperature exceeds a threshold and when it goes back down below it.

       <b>-vv</b>    Output  very  verbose  output. This option will output additional information than verbose output.
              Most notably it will output additional hex codes to given information on  ambiguous  SEL  entries,
              such  as  OEM codes. For example, it will output Generator ID hex codes for sensors without names,
              event type codes for OEM events, and record types for OEM records. This information may be  useful
              if you are writing a parser outside of <b>ipmi-sel</b> to interpret OEM information.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--info</b>
              Show general information about the SEL.

       <b>--display</b>=<u>RECORD-IDS-LIST</u>
              Display SEL records by record id. Accepts space or comma separated lists.

       <b>--exclude-display</b>=<u>RECORD-IDS-LIST</u>
              Exclude display of SEL records by record id. Accepts space or comma separated lists.

       <b>--display-range</b>=<u>START-END</u>
              Display SEL records from record id START to END.

       <b>--exclude-display-range</b>=<u>START-END</u>
              Exclude display of SEL records from record id START to END.

       <b>--date-range</b>=<u>DATE-DATE</u>
              Display  SEL records with events occurring in the specified date range.  Dates may be specified in
              MM/DD/YYYY, MM-DD-YYYY or the ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS format. For the non ISO  8601  formats,
              the  month  may be specified as a numeral or its abbreviated string name. The current local system
              time can be specified with  "now".  Note  that  non-timestamped  records  will  not  be  displayed
              automatically because they do not possess a timestamp.

       <b>--exclude-date-range</b>=<u>DATE-DATE</u>
              Exclude  display  of  SEL  records with events occurring in the specified date range. Dates may be
              specified in MM/DD/YYYY, MM-DD-YYYY or the ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS format. For  the  non  ISO
              8601  formats, the month may be specified as a numeral or its abbreviated string name. The current
              local system time can be  specified  with  "now".   Note  that  non-timestamped  records  will  be
              displayed automatically because they do not possess a timestamp.

       <b>-t</b> <u>SENSOR-TYPE-LIST</u>, <b>--sensor-types</b>=<u>SENSOR-TYPE-LIST</u>
              Specify  sensor types to show SEL events for. Multiple types can be separated by commas or spaces.
              A special command line type of "all", will indicate all types should be shown (may be  useful  for
              overriding configured defaults). Users may specify sensor types by string (see <b>--list-sensor-types</b>
              below) or by number (decimal or hex).

       <b>-T</b> <u>SENSOR-TYPE-LIST</u>, <b>--exclude-sensor-types</b>=<u>SENSOR-TYPE-LIST</u>
              Specify  sensor  types  to  not  show SEL events for. Multiple types can be separated by commas or
              spaces. A special command line type of "none", will indicate no types should be excluded  (may  be
              useful  for  overriding  configured  defaults).  Users  may  specify  sensor  types by string (see
              <b>--list-sensor-types</b> below) or by number (decimal or hex).

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--list-sensor-types</b>
              List sensor types.

       <b>--tail</b>=<u>count</u>
              Display approximately the last <u>count</u> SEL records. The display count is calculated by approximating
              the record ids of the last SEL records. It's correctness depends highly on the SEL  implementation
              by the vendor.

       <b>--clear</b>
              Clear SEL.

       <b>--post-clear</b>
              Identical  to  <b>--clear</b>,  except  the  SEL  clearing  will be performed after SEL event records are
              displayed. This option is useful for scripting if users intend to log SEL events to  another  log,
              then  immediately  clear SEL. Unlike calling <b>--clear</b> in another execution of <b>ipmi-sel,</b> this option
              will use SEL reservations to notify the user if a SEL change has  occurred  while  displaying  and
              clearing  the  SEL.  This  can  protect  users  from  a race, where a new SEL event is unknowingly
              generated before clearing the SEL. Note  that  SEL  reservations  are  optionally  implemented  by
              vendors and may not be available on all machines.

       <b>--delete</b>=<u>RECORD-IDS-LIST</u>
              Delete records by record id in the SEL. Accepts space or comma separated lists.

       <b>--delete-range</b>=<u>START-END</u>
              Delete record ids from START to END in the SEL.

       <b>--system-event-only</b>
              Output only system event records (i.e. don't output OEM records).

       <b>--oem-event-only</b>
              Output only OEM event records (i.e. don't output system event records).

       <b>--output-manufacturer-id</b>
              For OEM SEL record types, output the manufacturer ID along with event data when available.

       <b>--output-event-state</b>
              Output  event  state in output. This will add an additional output reporting if an event should be
              viewed as NOMINAL, WARNING, or CRITICAL.  The event state is an interpreted  value  based  on  the
              configuration  file  /etc/freeipmi//freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf  and  the  event  direction.   See
              <b><a href="../man5/freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf.5.html">freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf</a>(5)</b> for more information.

       <b>--event-state-config-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Specify an alternate event state configuration file. Option ignored  if  <b>--output-event-state</b>  not
              specified.

       <b>--hex-dump</b>
              Hex-dump SEL entries.

       <b>--interpret-oem-data</b>
              Attempt to interpret OEM data, such as event data, sensor readings, or general extra info, etc. If
              an  OEM  interpretation is not available, the default output will be generated. Correctness of OEM
              interpretations cannot be guaranteed due to potential changes OEM vendors may  make  in  products,
              firmware, etc. See OEM INTERPRETATION below for confirmed supported motherboard interpretations.

       <b>--output-oem-event-strings</b>
              Some motherboards support an IPMI OEM extension that returns the string output for a system event.
              Such  string output may be beneficial for determining the meaning behind OEM specific events. This
              option will use the OEM event string to describe all system events in the  <b>ipmi-sel</b>  output.  This
              option  differs  from <u>--interpret-oem-data</u> option in that all system events will output the vendor
              supplied event string, not just events that are  OEM  specific.  The  event  string  may  be  very
              different  from the normal FreeIPMI event string output. If an OEM event strings is not available,
              the default output will be output.  This option is confirmed to work for Fujitsu iRMC S1 and  iRMC
              S2 systems.

       <b>--entity-sensor-names</b>
              Output  sensor  names prefixed with their entity id and instance number when appropriate. This may
              be necessary on some motherboards to help identify what sensors are referencing.  For  example,  a
              motherboard  may  have  multiple  sensors named 'TEMP'. The entity id and instance number may help
              clarify which sensor refers to "Processor 1" vs. "Processor 2".

       <b>--no-sensor-type-output</b>
              Do not show sensor type output for each entry. On many systems, the sensor type  is  redundant  to
              the name of the sensor. This can especially be true if <b>--entity-sensor-names</b> is specified.  If the
              sensor name is sufficient, or if the sensor type is of no interest to the user, this option can be
              specified to condense output.

       <b>--comma-separated-output</b>
              Output fields in comma separated format.

       <b>--no-header-output</b>
              Do not output column headers. May be useful in scripting.

       <b>--non-abbreviated-units</b>
              Output  non-abbreviated  units  (e.g.  'Amps'  instead of 'A'). May aid in disambiguation of units
              (e.g. 'C' for Celsius or Coulombs).

       <b>--legacy-output</b>
              Output in legacy format. Newer options may not be applicable to legacy output.

</pre><h4><b>SDR</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This tool requires access to the sensor data repository (SDR) cache for general  operation.  By  default,
       SDR  data  will  be  downloaded  and  cached on the local machine. The following options apply to the SDR
       cache.

       <b>--flush-cache</b>
              Flush a cached version of the sensor data repository (SDR) cache. The SDR is typically cached  for
              faster  subsequent access. However, it may need to be flushed and re-generated if the SDR has been
              updated on a system.

       <b>--quiet-cache</b>
              Do not output information about cache creation/deletion. May be useful in scripting.

       <b>--sdr-cache-recreate</b>
              If the SDR cache is out of date or invalid, automatically  recreate  the  sensor  data  repository
              (SDR) cache. This option may be useful for scripting purposes.

       <b>--sdr-cache-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Specify  a  specific  sensor  data  repository (SDR) cache file to be stored or read from. If this
              option is used when multiple hosts are specified, the same SDR cache file will  be  used  for  all
              hosts.

       <b>--sdr-cache-directory</b>=<u>DIRECTORY</u>
              Specify  an alternate directory for sensor data repository (SDR) caches to be stored or read from.
              Defaults to the home directory if not specified.

       <b>--ignore-sdr-cache</b>
              Ignore SDR cache related processing. May lead to  incomplete  or  less  useful  information  being
              output,  however  it  will  allow  functionality  for systems without SDRs or when the correct SDR
              cannot be loaded.

</pre><h4><b>TIME</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       By IPMI definition, all IPMI times and timestamps are stored in localtime. However, in  many  situations,
       the  timestamps  will  not be stored in localtime. Whether or not a system truly stored the timestamps in
       localtime varies on many factors, such as the vendor, BIOS, and operating system.  The following  options
       will allow the user to adjust the interpretation of the stored timestamps and how they should be output.

       <b>--utc-to-localtime</b>
              Assume all times are reported in UTC time and convert the time to localtime before being output.

       <b>--localtime-to-utc</b>
              Convert all localtime timestamps to UTC before being output.

       <b>--utc-offset</b>=<u>SECONDS</u>
              Specify  a  specific UTC offset in seconds to be added to timestamps.  Value can range from -86400
              to 86400 seconds. Defaults to 0.

</pre><h4><b>HOSTRANGED</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following  options  manipulate  hostranged  output.  See  HOSTRANGED  SUPPORT  below  for  additional
       information on hostranges.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--buffer-output</b>
              Buffer  hostranged  output. For each node, buffer standard output until the node has completed its
              IPMI operation. When specifying this option, data may appear to output slower to  the  user  since
              the the entire IPMI operation must complete before any data can be output.  See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT
              below for additional information.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--consolidate-output</b>
              Consolidate  hostranged  output.  The  complete  standard output from every node specified will be
              consolidated so that nodes with identical output are not output twice. A header  will  list  those
              nodes with the consolidated output. When this option is specified, no output can be seen until the
              IPMI  operations  to  all  nodes  has  completed. If the user breaks out of the program early, all
              currently consolidated output  will  be  dumped.  See  HOSTRANGED  SUPPORT  below  for  additional
              information.

       <b>-F</b> <u>NUM</u>, <b>--fanout</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              Specify  multiple  host fanout. A "sliding window" (or fanout) algorithm is used for parallel IPMI
              communication so that slower nodes or timed out nodes will not impede parallel communication.  The
              maximum number of threads available at the same time is limited by the fanout. The default is 64.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--eliminate</b>
              Eliminate  hosts determined as undetected by <b>ipmidetect.</b>  This attempts to remove the common issue
              of hostranged execution timing out due to several nodes being removed  from  service  in  a  large
              cluster. The <b>ipmidetectd</b> daemon must be running on the node executing the command.

       <b>--always-prefix</b>
              Always  prefix output, even if only one host is specified or communicating in-band. This option is
              primarily useful for scripting purposes. Option will be ignored if specified with the <b>-C</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>HOSTRANGED</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Multiple hosts can be input either as an explicit comma separated lists of hosts or a range of  hostnames
       in  the  general  form:  prefix[n-m,l-k,...],  where  n  &lt; m and l &lt; k, etc. The later form should not be
       confused with regular expression character classes (also denoted by []). For example,  foo[19]  does  not
       represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a degenerate range: foo19.

       This  range  syntax  is  meant  only  as  a convenience on clusters with a prefixNN naming convention and
       specification of ranges should not be considered necessary -- the list foo1,foo9 could  be  specified  as
       such, or by the range foo[1,9].

       Some examples of range usage follow:
           foo[01-05] instead of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05
           foo[7,9-10] instead of foo7,foo9,foo10
           foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3

       As  a  reminder  to  the  reader,  some  shells  will  interpret brackets ([ and ]) for pattern matching.
       Depending on your shell, it may be necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.

       When multiple hosts are specified by the user, a thread will be executed for each host in parallel up  to
       the  configured  fanout (which can be adjusted via the <b>-F</b> option). This will allow communication to large
       numbers of nodes far more quickly than if done in serial.

       By default, standard output from each node specified will be output with the hostname prepended  to  each
       line.  Although  this  output  is  readable  in  many  situations,  it  may be difficult to read in other
       situations. For example, output from multiple nodes may be mixed together. The <b>-B</b> and <b>-C</b> options  can  be
       used to change this default.

       In-band  IPMI  Communication will be used when the host "localhost" is specified. This allows the user to
       add the localhost into the hostranged output.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       Most often, IPMI problems are due to configuration problems.

       IPMI over LAN problems involve a misconfiguration of the remote machine's BMC.  Double check to make sure
       the following are configured properly in the remote machine's BMC: IP address, MAC address, subnet  mask,
       username,  user  enablement,  user  privilege,  password,  LAN  privilege,  LAN  enablement,  and allowed
       authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0 connections, double check to make sure the cipher suite privilege(s)
       and K_g key are configured properly. The <b><a href="../man8/ipmi-config.8.html">ipmi-config</a>(8)</b> tool can be used to  check  and/or  change  these
       configuration settings.

       Inband IPMI problems are typically caused by improperly configured drivers or non-standard BMCs.

       In  addition  to  the  troubleshooting  tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below to also if there are any
       vendor specific bugs that have been discovered and worked around.

       Listed below are many of the common issues for error messages.  For additional support, please e-mail the
       &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt; mailing list.

       "username invalid" - The username entered (or a NULL username if none was entered) is  not  available  on
       the remote machine. It may also be possible the remote BMC's username configuration is incorrect.

       "password invalid" - The password entered (or a NULL password if none was entered) is not correct. It may
       also be possible the password for the user is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "password  verification  timeout"  -  Password  verification  has  timed out.  A "password invalid" error
       (described above) or a generic "session timeout" (described below) occurred.  During this  point  in  the
       protocol it cannot be differentiated which occurred.

       "k_g  invalid"  - The K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was entered) is not correct. It may also
       be possible the K_g key is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "privilege level insufficient" -  An  IPMI  command  requires  a  higher  user  privilege  than  the  one
       authenticated  with.  Please try to authenticate with a higher privilege. This may require authenticating
       to a different user which has a higher maximum privilege.

       "privilege level cannot be obtained  for  this  user"  -  The  privilege  level  you  are  attempting  to
       authenticate  with  is  higher  than  the  maximum  allowed  for this user. Please try again with a lower
       privilege. It may also be possible the maximum privilege level allowed  for  a  user  is  not  configured
       properly on the remote BMC.

       "authentication  type  unavailable  for  attempted privilege level" - The authentication type you wish to
       authenticate with is not available  for  this  privilege  level.  Please  try  again  with  an  alternate
       authentication  type  or  alternate privilege level. It may also be possible the available authentication
       types you can authenticate with are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "cipher suite id unavailable" - The cipher suite id you wish to authenticate with is not available on the
       remote BMC. Please try again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may also  be  possible  the  available
       cipher suite ids are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "ipmi  2.0  unavailable"  - IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote machine. Please try to use IPMI 1.5
       instead.

       "connection timeout" - Initial IPMI communication failed. A number  of  potential  errors  are  possible,
       including  an  invalid  hostname specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be resolved, IPMI is not enabled on
       the remote server, the network connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration and connectivity.

       "session timeout" - The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect.  If this error  occurs  often,  you
       may wish to increase the retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are considerably slower than others.

       "device  not  found"  - The specified device could not be found. Please check configuration or inputs and
       try again.

       "driver timeout" - Communication with the driver or device has timed out. Please try again.

       "message timeout" - Communication with the driver or device has timed out. Please try again.

       "BMC busy" - The BMC is currently busy. It may be processing information or have  too  many  simultaneous
       sessions to manage. Please wait and try again.

       "could  not  find  inband  device"  - An inband device could not be found.  Please check configuration or
       specify specific device or driver on the command line.

       "driver timeout" - The inband driver has timed out communicating to the local BMC or  service  processor.
       The BMC or service processor may be busy or (worst case) possibly non-functioning.

       "internal  IPMI  error" - An IPMI error has occurred that FreeIPMI does not know how to handle. Please e-
       mail &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt; to report the issue.

</pre><h4><b>IPMI-SEL</b> <b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       Some timestamps in the SEL may report a date of 1-Jan-1970, the epoch for SEL timestamps. This  timestamp
       is  not  necessarily incorrect. It usually indicates a hardware event that occurred before a timestamp in
       firmware has been initialized. For example, certain hardware components will have their  internal  clocks
       reset during a power cycle.

       However,  if the internal clock of the SEL appears to be regularly incorrect, you may need to set the SEL
       time. This can be done using <b><a href="../man8/bmc-device.8.html">bmc-device</a>(8).</b>

       The following are common SEL related messages.

       "sel config file parse error" - A parse error was found in the  sel  event  interpretation  configuration
       file. Please see <b><a href="../man5/freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf.5.html">freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf</a>(5).</b>

</pre><h4><b>WORKAROUNDS</b></h4><pre>
       With  so  many  different  vendors implementing their own IPMI solutions, different vendors may implement
       their IPMI protocols incorrectly. The following describes a number of workarounds currently available  to
       handle  discovered  compliance  issues.  When possible, workarounds have been implemented so they will be
       transparent to the user. However, some will require the user to specify a workaround be used via  the  -W
       option.

       The hardware listed below may only indicate the hardware that a problem was discovered on. Newer versions
       of  hardware  may  fix the problems indicated below. Similar machines from vendors may or may not exhibit
       the same problems. Different vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI firmware developer, so
       it may be worthwhile to try workarounds listed below even if your motherboard is not listed.

       If you believe your  hardware  has  an  additional  compliance  issue  that  needs  a  workaround  to  be
       implemented,    please    contact    the    FreeIPMI    maintainers    on   &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt;   or
       &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-devel@gnu.org">freeipmi-devel@gnu.org</a>&gt;.

       <u>assumeio</u> - This workaround flag will assume inband interfaces communicate with  system  I/O  rather  than
       being memory-mapped. This will work around systems that report invalid base addresses. Those hitting this
       issue  may  see  "device  not  supported" or "could not find inband device" errors.  Issue observed on HP
       ProLiant DL145 G1.

       <u>spinpoll</u> - This workaround flag will inform some inband drivers (most notably the  KCS  driver)  to  spin
       while  polling  rather  than  putting the process to sleep. This may significantly improve the wall clock
       running time of tools because an operating system scheduler's granularity may be  much  larger  than  the
       time  it  takes  to  perform  a single IPMI message transaction. However, by spinning, your system may be
       performing less useful work by not contexting out the tool for a more useful task.

       <u>authcap</u> - This  workaround  flag  will  skip  early  checks  for  username  capabilities,  authentication
       capabilities,  and  K_g support and allow IPMI authentication to succeed. It works around multiple issues
       in which the remote system does not properly report username capabilities,  authentication  capabilities,
       or  K_g status. Those hitting this issue may see "username invalid", "authentication type unavailable for
       attempted privilege level", or "k_g invalid" errors.  Issue observed  on  Asus  P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4,
       Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.

       <u>nochecksumcheck</u>  -  This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the checksums returned from IPMI
       command responses. It works around systems that return invalid checksums due  to  implementation  errors,
       but  the  packet  is  otherwise  valid.  Users  are  cautioned  on  the use of this option, as it removes
       validation of packet integrity in a number of circumstances. However, it is unlikely to be  an  issue  in
       most  situations.  Those hitting this issue may see "connection timeout", "session timeout", or "password
       verification timeout" errors. On IPMI 1.5 connections, the "noauthcodecheck" workaround may  also  needed
       too. Issue observed on Supermicro X9SCM-iiF, Supermicro X9DRi-F, and Supermicro X9DRFR.

       <u>idzero</u>  - This workaround flag will allow empty session IDs to be accepted by the client. It works around
       IPMI sessions that report empty session IDs to the client. Those hitting  this  issue  may  see  "session
       timeout" errors. Issue observed on Tyan S2882 with M3289 BMC.

       <u>unexpectedauth</u>  -  This  workaround flag will allow unexpected non-null authcodes to be checked as though
       they were expected. It works around an issue when packets contain non-null authentication data when  they
       should  be  null  due  to  disabled per-message authentication. Those hitting this issue may see "session
       timeout" errors. Issue observed on Dell PowerEdge 2850,SC1425. Confirmed fixed on newer firmware.

       <u>forcepermsg</u> - This workaround flag will force per-message authentication to be used  no  matter  what  is
       advertised  by  the remote system. It works around an issue when per-message authentication is advertised
       as disabled on the remote system, but it is actually required for the protocol. Those hitting this  issue
       may see "session timeout" errors.  Issue observed on IBM eServer 325.

       <u>endianseq</u>  -  This  workaround  flag  will  flip  the endian of the session sequence numbers to allow the
       session to continue properly. It works around IPMI 1.5  session  sequence  numbers  that  are  the  wrong
       endian.   Those  hitting  this  issue  may  see "session timeout" errors. Issue observed on some Sun ILOM
       1.0/2.0 (depends on service processor endian).

       <u>noauthcodecheck</u> - This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the authentication codes  returned
       from  IPMI 1.5 command responses. It works around systems that return invalid authentication codes due to
       hashing or implementation errors. Users are cautioned on the  use  of  this  option,  as  it  removes  an
       authentication check verifying the validity of a packet. However, in most organizations, this is unlikely
       to  be  a  security  issue.  Those hitting this issue may see "connection timeout", "session timeout", or
       "password verification timeout" errors.  Issue observed on Xyratex  FB-H8-SRAY,  Intel  Windmill,  Quanta
       Winterfell, and Wiwynn Windmill.

       <u>intel20</u>  - This workaround flag will work around several Intel IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The issues
       covered include padding of usernames, and password truncation if the authentication  algorithm  is  HMAC-
       MD5-128.  Those  hitting  this  issue  may  see  "username invalid", "password invalid", or "k_g invalid"
       errors. Issue observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module (Professional Edition).

       <u>supermicro20</u> - This workaround flag will work around several Supermicro IPMI 2.0 authentication issues on
       motherboards  w/  Peppercon  IPMI  firmware.  The  issues  covered  include   handling   invalid   length
       authentication  codes.  Those  hitting  this  issue may see "password invalid" errors.  Issue observed on
       Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card. Confirmed fixed on newerver firmware.

       <u>sun20</u> - This workaround flag will work work around several Sun IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The issues
       covered include invalid lengthed hash keys, improperly hashed keys, and  invalid  cipher  suite  records.
       Those  hitting  this  issue may see "password invalid" or "bmc error" errors.  Issue observed on Sun Fire
       4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.  This workaround automatically includes the "opensesspriv" workaround.

       <u>opensesspriv</u> - This workaround flag will slightly  alter  FreeIPMI's  IPMI  2.0  connection  protocol  to
       workaround  an  invalid  hashing algorithm used by the remote system. The privilege level sent during the
       Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0 connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege level sent
       during the RAKP1 connection stage. Those hitting this issue may see "password  invalid",  "k_g  invalid",
       "bad rmcpplus status code", or "privilege level cannot be obtained for this user" errors.  Issue observed
       on  Sun  Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG,
       Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN, Dell C5220,
       and the OpenIPMI software BMC. This workaround is automatically triggered with the "sun20" workaround.

       <u>integritycheckvalue</u> - This workaround flag will work around an invalid integrity check  value  during  an
       IPMI  2.0  session  establishment  when  using  Cipher  Suite ID 0. The integrity check value should be 0
       length, however the remote motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting this issue may  see
       "k_g  invalid"  errors.  Issue observed on Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel S5500WBV/Penguin
       Relion 700, and Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X.

       <u>assumemaxsdrrecordcount</u> - This workaround will inform SDR reading to stop reading after a  known  maximum
       number  of  SDR  records  have  been  read.  This will work around systems that have miss-implemented SDR
       reading functions. Those hitting this issue may see "SDR record count invalid" errors. Issue observed  on
       unspecified Inspur motherboard.

       <u>assumesystemevent</u> - This workaround option will assume invalid SEL record types are system event records.
       Records  may  be  formatted  correctly  but report invalid record types. Those hitting this issue may see
       "Unknown SEL Record Type" errors. Output may be unknown, pray for the best. This option is  confirmed  to
       work around compliances issues on HP DL 380 G5 motherboards.

       No  IPMI  1.5  Support - Some motherboards that support IPMI 2.0 have been found to not support IPMI 1.5.
       Those hitting this issue may see "ipmi 2.0 unavailable" or "connection timeout" errors. This issue can be
       worked around by using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by specifying <b>--driver-type</b>=<u>LAN_2_0</u>.  Issue  observed
       on a number of HP and Supermicro motherboards.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful execution, exit status is 0. On error, exit status is 1.

       If  multiple  hosts  are  specified  for  communication,  the exit status is 0 if and only if all targets
       successfully execute. Otherwise the exit status is 1.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       On older operating systems, if you input your username, password, and other potentially security relevant
       information on the command line, this information may be discovered by other users when using tools  like
       the  <b><a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a>(1)</b>  command  or  looking  in the <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> file system. It is generally more secure to input password
       information with options like the -P or -K options. Configuring  security  relevant  information  in  the
       FreeIPMI configuration file would also be an appropriate way to hide this information.

       In  order  to  prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will temporarily "lock up" after a number of remote
       authentication errors. You may need to wait awhile in order to this temporary "lock up"  to  pass  before
       you may authenticate again.
