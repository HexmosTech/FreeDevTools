       ipmi-raw - execute IPMI commands by hex values

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ipmi-raw</b> [<u>OPTION</u>...] [<u>&lt;lun&gt;</u> <u>&lt;netfn&gt;</u> <u>COMMAND-HEX-BYTES</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Ipmi-raw</b>  is  used to execute IPMI commands by hex values. Hex values may be input on the command line, a
       file via the <b>--file</b> option, or via stdin if neither of the previous are specified.

       Listed below are general IPMI options, tool specific options, trouble  shooting  information,  workaround
       information, examples, and known issues. For a general introduction to FreeIPMI please see <b><a href="../man7/freeipmi.7.html">freeipmi</a>(7).</b>

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  options are general options for configuring IPMI communication and executing general tool
       commands.

       <b>-D</b> <u>IPMIDRIVER</u>, <b>--driver-type</b>=<u>IPMIDRIVER</u>
              Specify the driver type to use instead of  doing  an  auto  selection.   The  currently  available
              outofband  drivers  are  LAN  and  LAN_2_0,  which perform IPMI 1.5 and IPMI 2.0 respectively. The
              currently available inband drivers are KCS, SSIF, OPENIPMI, SUNBMC, and INTELDCMI.

       <b>--disable-auto-probe</b>
              Do not probe in-band IPMI devices for default settings.

       <b>--driver-address</b>=<u>DRIVER-ADDRESS</u>
              Specify the in-band driver address to be used instead of the probed value.  <u>DRIVER-ADDRESS</u>  should
              be prefixed with "0x" for a hex value and '0' for an octal value.

       <b>--driver-device</b>=<u>DEVICE</u>
              Specify the in-band driver device path to be used instead of the probed path.

       <b>--register-spacing</b>=<u>REGISTER-SPACING</u>
              Specify  the  in-band  driver  register  spacing instead of the probed value. Argument is in bytes
              (i.e. 32bit register spacing = 4)

       <b>--target-channel-number</b>=<u>CHANNEL-NUMBER</u>
              Specify the in-band driver target channel number to send IPMI requests to.

       <b>--target-slave-address</b>=<u>SLAVE-ADDRESS</u>
              Specify the in-band driver target slave number to send IPMI requests to.

       <b>-h</b> <u>IPMIHOST1,IPMIHOST2,...</u>, <b>--hostname</b>=<u>IPMIHOST1[:PORT],IPMIHOST2[:PORT],...</u>
              Specify the remote host(s) to communicate with. Multiple hostnames may be separated  by  comma  or
              may  be  specified  in  a  range  format;  see  HOSTRANGED  SUPPORT below. An optional port can be
              specified with each host, which may be useful  in  port  forwarding  or  similar  situations.   If
              specifying an IPv6 address and port, use the format [ADDRESS]:PORT.

       <b>-u</b> <u>USERNAME</u>, <b>--username</b>=<u>USERNAME</u>
              Specify  the  username  to use when authenticating with the remote host.  If not specified, a null
              (i.e. anonymous) username is assumed. The required user privilege will depend on the raw  commands
              executed.

       <b>-p</b> <u>PASSWORD</u>, <b>--password</b>=<u>PASSWORD</u>
              Specify  the  password to use when authenticationg with the remote host.  If not specified, a null
              password is assumed. Maximum password length is 16 for IPMI 1.5 and 20 for IPMI 2.0.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--password-prompt</b>
              Prompt for password to avoid possibility of listing it in process lists.

       <b>-k</b> <u>K_G</u>, <b>--k-g</b>=<u>K_G</u>
              Specify the K_g BMC key to use when authenticating with the remote  host  for  IPMI  2.0.  If  not
              specified,  a  null  key  is assumed. To input the key in hexadecimal form, prefix the string with
              '0x'. E.g., the key 'abc' can be entered with the either the string 'abc' or the string '0x616263'

       <b>-K</b>, <b>--k-g-prompt</b>
              Prompt for k-g to avoid possibility of listing it in process lists.

       <b>--session-timeout</b>=<u>MILLISECONDS</u>
              Specify the session timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 20000 milliseconds (20  seconds)  if  not
              specified.

       <b>--retransmission-timeout</b>=<u>MILLISECONDS</u>
              Specify  the  packet  retransmission  timeout  in  milliseconds.  Defaults to 1000 milliseconds (1
              second) if not specified. The retransmission timeout cannot be larger than the session timeout.

       <b>-a</b> <u>AUTHENTICATION-TYPE</u>, <b>--authentication-type</b>=<u>AUTHENTICATION-TYPE</u>
              Specify the IPMI 1.5 authentication type to use. The currently available authentication types  are
              NONE, STRAIGHT_PASSWORD_KEY, MD2, and MD5. Defaults to MD5 if not specified.

       <b>-I</b> <u>CIPHER-SUITE-ID</u>, <b>--cipher-suite-id</b>=<u>CIPHER-SUITE-ID</u>
              Specify  the  IPMI  2.0  cipher  suite  ID  to  use.  The  Cipher  Suite  ID  identifies  a set of
              authentication, integrity, and confidentiality algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0  communication.  The
              authentication  algorithm  identifies  the  algorithm  to  use  for  session  setup, the integrity
              algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for session packet signatures, and  the  confidentiality
              algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher suite ID 3 if
              not specified. The following cipher suite ids are currently supported:

              0 - Authentication Algorithm = None; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None

              1  - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm =
              None

              2 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1;  Integrity  Algorithm  =  HMAC-SHA1-96;  Confidentiality
              Algorithm = None

              3  -  Authentication  Algorithm  =  HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality
              Algorithm = AES-CBC-128

              6 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality  Algorithm  =
              None

              7  -  Authentication  Algorithm  =  HMAC-MD5;  Integrity Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality
              Algorithm = None

              8 - Authentication Algorithm =  HMAC-MD5;  Integrity  Algorithm  =  HMAC-MD5-128;  Confidentiality
              Algorithm = AES-CBC-128

              11 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm
              = None

              12 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm
              = AES-CBC-128

              15 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA256; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm
              = None

              16   -   Authentication   Algorithm   =   HMAC-SHA256;   Integrity  Algorithm  =  HMAC_SHA256_128;
              Confidentiality Algorithm = None

              17  -  Authentication  Algorithm   =   HMAC-SHA256;   Integrity   Algorithm   =   HMAC_SHA256_128;
              Confidentiality Algorithm = AES-CBC-128

       <b>-l</b> <u>PRIVILEGE-LEVEL</u>, <b>--privilege-level</b>=<u>PRIVILEGE-LEVEL</u>
              Specify  the  privilege  level  to  be  used.  The  currently available privilege levels are USER,
              OPERATOR, and ADMIN. Defaults to ADMIN if not specified.

       <b>--config-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Specify an alternate configuration file.

       <b>-W</b> <u>WORKAROUNDS</u>, <b>--workaround-flags</b>=<u>WORKAROUNDS</u>
              Specify workarounds to vendor compliance issues. Multiple workarounds can be  specified  separated
              by  commas. A special command line flag of "none", will indicate no workarounds (may be useful for
              overriding configured defaults). See WORKAROUNDS below for a list of available workarounds.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Turn on debugging.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Output a help list and exit.

       <b>--usage</b>
              Output a usage message and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Output the program version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>IPMI-RAW</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are specific to <b>ipmi-raw.</b>

       <b>--file</b>=<u>CMD-FILE</u>
              Specify a file to read command requests from.

       <b>--no-session</b>
              If performing out of band communication, do not establish an IPMI session  and  send  raw  packets
              without  having established a session/authenticating. This option is predominantly for testing the
              few IPMI packets that can work outside of a session and should not be  used  by  the  majority  of
              users.

</pre><h4><b>HOSTRANGED</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  options  manipulate  hostranged  output.  See  HOSTRANGED  SUPPORT  below  for additional
       information on hostranges.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--buffer-output</b>
              Buffer hostranged output. For each node, buffer standard output until the node has  completed  its
              IPMI  operation.  When  specifying this option, data may appear to output slower to the user since
              the the entire IPMI operation must complete before any data can be output.  See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT
              below for additional information.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--consolidate-output</b>
              Consolidate hostranged output. The complete standard output from  every  node  specified  will  be
              consolidated  so  that  nodes with identical output are not output twice. A header will list those
              nodes with the consolidated output. When this option is specified, no output can be seen until the
              IPMI operations to all nodes has completed. If the user breaks  out  of  the  program  early,  all
              currently  consolidated  output  will  be  dumped.  See  HOSTRANGED  SUPPORT  below for additional
              information.

       <b>-F</b> <u>NUM</u>, <b>--fanout</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              Specify multiple host fanout. A "sliding window" (or fanout) algorithm is used for  parallel  IPMI
              communication  so that slower nodes or timed out nodes will not impede parallel communication. The
              maximum number of threads available at the same time is limited by the fanout. The default is 64.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--eliminate</b>
              Eliminate hosts determined as undetected by <b>ipmidetect.</b>  This attempts to remove the common  issue
              of  hostranged  execution  timing  out  due to several nodes being removed from service in a large
              cluster. The <b>ipmidetectd</b> daemon must be running on the node executing the command.

       <b>--always-prefix</b>
              Always prefix output, even if only one host is specified or communicating in-band. This option  is
              primarily useful for scripting purposes. Option will be ignored if specified with the <b>-C</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>HOSTRANGED</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Multiple  hosts can be input either as an explicit comma separated lists of hosts or a range of hostnames
       in the general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n &lt; m and l &lt; k,  etc.  The  later  form  should  not  be
       confused  with  regular  expression character classes (also denoted by []). For example, foo[19] does not
       represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a degenerate range: foo19.

       This range syntax is meant only as a convenience on  clusters  with  a  prefixNN  naming  convention  and
       specification  of  ranges  should not be considered necessary -- the list foo1,foo9 could be specified as
       such, or by the range foo[1,9].

       Some examples of range usage follow:
           foo[01-05] instead of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05
           foo[7,9-10] instead of foo7,foo9,foo10
           foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3

       As a reminder to the reader, some shells  will  interpret  brackets  ([  and  ])  for  pattern  matching.
       Depending on your shell, it may be necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.

       When  multiple hosts are specified by the user, a thread will be executed for each host in parallel up to
       the configured fanout (which can be adjusted via the <b>-F</b> option). This will allow communication  to  large
       numbers of nodes far more quickly than if done in serial.

       By  default,  standard output from each node specified will be output with the hostname prepended to each
       line. Although this output is readable in  many  situations,  it  may  be  difficult  to  read  in  other
       situations.  For  example, output from multiple nodes may be mixed together. The <b>-B</b> and <b>-C</b> options can be
       used to change this default.

       In-band IPMI Communication will be used when the host "localhost" is specified. This allows the  user  to
       add the localhost into the hostranged output.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       Most often, IPMI problems are due to configuration problems.

       IPMI over LAN problems involve a misconfiguration of the remote machine's BMC.  Double check to make sure
       the  following are configured properly in the remote machine's BMC: IP address, MAC address, subnet mask,
       username, user  enablement,  user  privilege,  password,  LAN  privilege,  LAN  enablement,  and  allowed
       authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0 connections, double check to make sure the cipher suite privilege(s)
       and  K_g  key  are  configured properly. The <b><a href="../man8/ipmi-config.8.html">ipmi-config</a>(8)</b> tool can be used to check and/or change these
       configuration settings.

       Inband IPMI problems are typically caused by improperly configured drivers or non-standard BMCs.

       In addition to the troubleshooting tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below to  also  if  there  are  any
       vendor specific bugs that have been discovered and worked around.

       Listed below are many of the common issues for error messages.  For additional support, please e-mail the
       &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt; mailing list.

       "username  invalid"  -  The username entered (or a NULL username if none was entered) is not available on
       the remote machine. It may also be possible the remote BMC's username configuration is incorrect.

       "password invalid" - The password entered (or a NULL password if none was entered) is not correct. It may
       also be possible the password for the user is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "password verification timeout" - Password verification  has  timed  out.   A  "password  invalid"  error
       (described  above)  or  a generic "session timeout" (described below) occurred.  During this point in the
       protocol it cannot be differentiated which occurred.

       "k_g invalid" - The K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was entered) is not correct. It  may  also
       be possible the K_g key is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "privilege  level  insufficient"  -  An  IPMI  command  requires  a  higher  user  privilege than the one
       authenticated with. Please try to authenticate with a higher privilege. This may  require  authenticating
       to a different user which has a higher maximum privilege.

       "privilege  level  cannot  be  obtained  for  this  user"  -  The  privilege  level you are attempting to
       authenticate with is higher than the maximum allowed for  this  user.  Please  try  again  with  a  lower
       privilege.  It  may  also  be  possible  the maximum privilege level allowed for a user is not configured
       properly on the remote BMC.

       "authentication type unavailable for attempted privilege level" - The authentication  type  you  wish  to
       authenticate  with  is  not  available  for  this  privilege  level.  Please  try again with an alternate
       authentication type or alternate privilege level. It may also be possible  the  available  authentication
       types you can authenticate with are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "cipher suite id unavailable" - The cipher suite id you wish to authenticate with is not available on the
       remote  BMC.  Please  try  again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may also be possible the available
       cipher suite ids are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.

       "ipmi 2.0 unavailable" - IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote machine. Please try to  use  IPMI  1.5
       instead.

       "connection  timeout"  -  Initial  IPMI  communication failed. A number of potential errors are possible,
       including an invalid hostname specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be resolved, IPMI is  not  enabled  on
       the remote server, the network connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration and connectivity.

       "session  timeout"  -  The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect.  If this error occurs often, you
       may wish to increase the retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are considerably slower than others.

       "device not found" - The specified device could not be found. Please check configuration  or  inputs  and
       try again.

       "driver timeout" - Communication with the driver or device has timed out. Please try again.

       "message timeout" - Communication with the driver or device has timed out. Please try again.

       "BMC  busy"  -  The BMC is currently busy. It may be processing information or have too many simultaneous
       sessions to manage. Please wait and try again.

       "could not find inband device" - An inband device could not be  found.   Please  check  configuration  or
       specify specific device or driver on the command line.

       "driver  timeout"  - The inband driver has timed out communicating to the local BMC or service processor.
       The BMC or service processor may be busy or (worst case) possibly non-functioning.

       "internal IPMI error" - An IPMI error has occurred that FreeIPMI does not know how to handle.  Please  e-
       mail &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt; to report the issue.

</pre><h4><b>WORKAROUNDS</b></h4><pre>
       With  so  many  different  vendors implementing their own IPMI solutions, different vendors may implement
       their IPMI protocols incorrectly. The following describes a number of workarounds currently available  to
       handle  discovered  compliance  issues.  When possible, workarounds have been implemented so they will be
       transparent to the user. However, some will require the user to specify a workaround be used via  the  -W
       option.

       The hardware listed below may only indicate the hardware that a problem was discovered on. Newer versions
       of  hardware  may  fix the problems indicated below. Similar machines from vendors may or may not exhibit
       the same problems. Different vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI firmware developer, so
       it may be worthwhile to try workarounds listed below even if your motherboard is not listed.

       If you believe your  hardware  has  an  additional  compliance  issue  that  needs  a  workaround  to  be
       implemented,    please    contact    the    FreeIPMI    maintainers    on   &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-users@gnu.org">freeipmi-users@gnu.org</a>&gt;   or
       &lt;<a href="mailto:freeipmi-devel@gnu.org">freeipmi-devel@gnu.org</a>&gt;.

       <u>assumeio</u> - This workaround flag will assume inband interfaces communicate with  system  I/O  rather  than
       being memory-mapped. This will work around systems that report invalid base addresses. Those hitting this
       issue  may  see  "device  not  supported" or "could not find inband device" errors.  Issue observed on HP
       ProLiant DL145 G1.

       <u>spinpoll</u> - This workaround flag will inform some inband drivers (most notably the  KCS  driver)  to  spin
       while  polling  rather  than  putting the process to sleep. This may significantly improve the wall clock
       running time of tools because an operating system scheduler's granularity may be  much  larger  than  the
       time  it  takes  to  perform  a single IPMI message transaction. However, by spinning, your system may be
       performing less useful work by not contexting out the tool for a more useful task.

       <u>authcap</u> - This  workaround  flag  will  skip  early  checks  for  username  capabilities,  authentication
       capabilities,  and  K_g support and allow IPMI authentication to succeed. It works around multiple issues
       in which the remote system does not properly report username capabilities,  authentication  capabilities,
       or  K_g status. Those hitting this issue may see "username invalid", "authentication type unavailable for
       attempted privilege level", or "k_g invalid" errors.  Issue observed  on  Asus  P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4,
       Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.

       <u>nochecksumcheck</u>  -  This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the checksums returned from IPMI
       command responses. It works around systems that return invalid checksums due  to  implementation  errors,
       but  the  packet  is  otherwise  valid.  Users  are  cautioned  on  the use of this option, as it removes
       validation of packet integrity in a number of circumstances. However, it is unlikely to be  an  issue  in
       most  situations.  Those hitting this issue may see "connection timeout", "session timeout", or "password
       verification timeout" errors. On IPMI 1.5 connections, the "noauthcodecheck" workaround may  also  needed
       too. Issue observed on Supermicro X9SCM-iiF, Supermicro X9DRi-F, and Supermicro X9DRFR.

       <u>idzero</u>  - This workaround flag will allow empty session IDs to be accepted by the client. It works around
       IPMI sessions that report empty session IDs to the client. Those hitting  this  issue  may  see  "session
       timeout" errors. Issue observed on Tyan S2882 with M3289 BMC.

       <u>unexpectedauth</u>  -  This  workaround flag will allow unexpected non-null authcodes to be checked as though
       they were expected. It works around an issue when packets contain non-null authentication data when  they
       should  be  null  due  to  disabled per-message authentication. Those hitting this issue may see "session
       timeout" errors. Issue observed on Dell PowerEdge 2850,SC1425. Confirmed fixed on newer firmware.

       <u>forcepermsg</u> - This workaround flag will force per-message authentication to be used  no  matter  what  is
       advertised  by  the remote system. It works around an issue when per-message authentication is advertised
       as disabled on the remote system, but it is actually required for the protocol. Those hitting this  issue
       may see "session timeout" errors.  Issue observed on IBM eServer 325.

       <u>endianseq</u>  -  This  workaround  flag  will  flip  the endian of the session sequence numbers to allow the
       session to continue properly. It works around IPMI 1.5  session  sequence  numbers  that  are  the  wrong
       endian.   Those  hitting  this  issue  may  see "session timeout" errors. Issue observed on some Sun ILOM
       1.0/2.0 (depends on service processor endian).

       <u>noauthcodecheck</u> - This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the authentication codes  returned
       from  IPMI 1.5 command responses. It works around systems that return invalid authentication codes due to
       hashing or implementation errors. Users are cautioned on the  use  of  this  option,  as  it  removes  an
       authentication check verifying the validity of a packet. However, in most organizations, this is unlikely
       to  be  a  security  issue.  Those hitting this issue may see "connection timeout", "session timeout", or
       "password verification timeout" errors.  Issue observed on Xyratex  FB-H8-SRAY,  Intel  Windmill,  Quanta
       Winterfell, and Wiwynn Windmill.

       <u>intel20</u>  - This workaround flag will work around several Intel IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The issues
       covered include padding of usernames, and password truncation if the authentication  algorithm  is  HMAC-
       MD5-128.  Those  hitting  this  issue  may  see  "username invalid", "password invalid", or "k_g invalid"
       errors. Issue observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module (Professional Edition).

       <u>supermicro20</u> - This workaround flag will work around several Supermicro IPMI 2.0 authentication issues on
       motherboards  w/  Peppercon  IPMI  firmware.  The  issues  covered  include   handling   invalid   length
       authentication  codes.  Those  hitting  this  issue may see "password invalid" errors.  Issue observed on
       Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card. Confirmed fixed on newerver firmware.

       <u>sun20</u> - This workaround flag will work work around several Sun IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The issues
       covered include invalid lengthed hash keys, improperly hashed keys, and  invalid  cipher  suite  records.
       Those  hitting  this  issue may see "password invalid" or "bmc error" errors.  Issue observed on Sun Fire
       4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.  This workaround automatically includes the "opensesspriv" workaround.

       <u>opensesspriv</u> - This workaround flag will slightly  alter  FreeIPMI's  IPMI  2.0  connection  protocol  to
       workaround  an  invalid  hashing algorithm used by the remote system. The privilege level sent during the
       Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0 connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege level sent
       during the RAKP1 connection stage. Those hitting this issue may see "password  invalid",  "k_g  invalid",
       "bad rmcpplus status code", or "privilege level cannot be obtained for this user" errors.  Issue observed
       on  Sun  Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG,
       Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN, Dell C5220,
       and the OpenIPMI software BMC. This workaround is automatically triggered with the "sun20" workaround.

       <u>integritycheckvalue</u> - This workaround flag will work around an invalid integrity check  value  during  an
       IPMI  2.0  session  establishment  when  using  Cipher  Suite ID 0. The integrity check value should be 0
       length, however the remote motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting this issue may  see
       "k_g  invalid"  errors.  Issue observed on Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel S5500WBV/Penguin
       Relion 700, and Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X.

       No IPMI 1.5 Support - Some motherboards that support IPMI 2.0 have been found to not  support  IPMI  1.5.
       Those hitting this issue may see "ipmi 2.0 unavailable" or "connection timeout" errors. This issue can be
       worked  around  by using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by specifying <b>--driver-type</b>=<u>LAN_2_0</u>. Issue observed
       on a number of HP and Supermicro motherboards.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful execution, exit status is 0. On error, exit status is 1.

       If multiple hosts are specified for communication, the exit status is  0  if  and  only  if  all  targets
       successfully execute. Otherwise the exit status is 1.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       On older operating systems, if you input your username, password, and other potentially security relevant
       information  on the command line, this information may be discovered by other users when using tools like
       the <b><a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a>(1)</b> command or looking in the <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> file system. It is generally  more  secure  to  input  password
       information  with  options  like  the  -P or -K options. Configuring security relevant information in the
       FreeIPMI configuration file would also be an appropriate way to hide this information.

       In order to prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will temporarily "lock up" after a  number  of  remote
       authentication  errors.  You  may need to wait awhile in order to this temporary "lock up" to pass before
       you may authenticate again.
