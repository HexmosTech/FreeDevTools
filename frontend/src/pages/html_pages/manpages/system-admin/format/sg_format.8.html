</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Not all SCSI direct access devices need  to  be  formatted  and  some  have  vendor  specific  formatting
       procedures.  SCSI  disks  with rotating media are probably the largest group that do support a 'standard'
       format operation. They are typically factory formatted to a block size of  512  bytes  with  the  largest
       number  of  blocks  that  the manufacturer recommends. The manufacturer's recommendation typically leaves
       aside a certain number of tracks, spread across the media, for reassignment of blocks  to  logical  block
       addresses during the life of the disk.

       This  utility issues one of three SCSI format commands: FORMAT UNIT, FORMAT MEDIUM or FORMAT WITH PRESET.
       In the following description, unqualified sections will usually be referring  to  the  SCSI  FORMAT  UNIT
       command.  Both  FORMAT  UNIT  and  FORMAT  WITH PRESET apply to disks (or disk-like devices).  The FORMAT
       MEDIUM command is for tapes. A SCSI INQUIRY response categorizes the 'Peripheral Device  Type'  (PDT)  of
       each  SCSI  device.  This utility uses the PDT to check if there is a conflict between the <u>DEVICE</u> and the
       given option (e.g. giving the <u>--tape=FM</u> option when <u>DEVICE</u> is a normal disk). If  there  is  a  conflict,
       this utility will not continue.

       This  utility can format modern SCSI disks and potentially change their block size (if permitted) and the
       block count (i.e. number of accessible blocks on the media also known as "resizing"). Resizing a disk  to
       less  than  the  manufacturer's  recommended  block count is sometimes called "short stroking" (see NOTES
       section). Resizing the block count while not changing the block size may not require a format  operation.
       The  SBC-2  standard (see www.t10.org) has obsoleted the "format device" mode page. Many of the low level
       details found in that mode page are now left up to the discretion of the manufacturer. There is a  Format
       Status log page which reports on the previous successful format operation(s).

       When  this  utility  is  used without options (i.e. it is only given a <u>DEVICE</u> argument) it prints out the
       existing block size and block count derived from two sources. These two sources are a block descriptor in
       the response to a MODE SENSE command and the response to a READ CAPACITY command.  The  reason  for  this
       double  check  is  to detect a "format corrupt" state (see the NOTES section). This usage will not modify
       the disk.

       When this utility is used with either <u>--format</u>, <u>--preset=ID</u> or <u>--tape=FM</u>, it will attempt to  format  the
       given  DEVICE. In the absence of the <u>--quick</u> option there is a 15 second pause during which time the user
       is invited thrice (5 seconds apart) to abort sg_format. This occurs just  prior  the  SCSI  FORMAT  UNIT,
       FORMAT WITH PRESET or FORMAT MEDIUM command being issued. See the NOTES section for more information.

       Protection  information (PI) is optional and is made up of one or more protection intervals, each made up
       of 8 bytes associated with a logical block. When PI is active each logical block will have 1,  2,  4,  8,
       etc  protection  intervals (i.e. a power of two), interleaved with (and following) the user data to which
       they refer. Four protection types are defined with protection type 0 being no protection  intervals.  See
       the PROTECTION INFORMATION section below for more information.

       When  the  <u>--tape=FM</u>  option  is  given then the SCSI FORMAT MEDIUM command is sent to the <u>DEVICE</u>. FORMAT
       MEDIUM is defined in the SSC  documents  at  T10  and  prepares  a  volume  for  use.  That  may  include
       partitioning the medium. See the section below on TAPE for more information.

       The  FORMAT  WITH  PRESET  was added in draft SBC-4 revision 18. A preset pattern, selected by the PRESET
       IDENTIFIER field (<u>--id=FWPID</u>), is written to the disk. See the FORMAT PRESETS VPD page (0xb8) for a  list
       of available Format preset identifiers and their associated data.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments  to  long  options  are  mandatory  for  short  options  as  well.  The options are arranged in
       alphabetical order based on the long option name.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--cappid</b>
              this option sets the CAPPID bit in the  MODE  SELECT  header  which  is  part  of  that  command's
              parameter  list. A MODE SELECT command is needed when the <u>COUNT</u> (i.e. number of logical blocks) is
              being changed. The MODE SELECT command needs to complete successfully before FORMAT  UNIT  command
              is  performed.  The  CAPPID  bit  (introduced  in  SBC-5  revision  4)  is  closely related to the
              Capacity/Product identification mapping VPD page (0xba).  If that VPD page is  not  present,  then
              the  CAPPID  bit is not set unless the option is given twice. If the CAPPID bit is not supported a
              sense key of illegal request with an additional sense of "invalid field in parameter list"  should
              be reported.
              If  successful, this option may lead to the standard INQUIRY response Product identification field
              being changed. If so, a Unit attention condition is set with an additional sense of "Inquiry  data
              has changed".

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--cmplst</b>={0|1}
              sets  the  CMPLST  ("complete list") bit in the FORMAT UNIT cdb to 0 or 1.  If the value is 0 then
              the existing GLIST (grown list) is taken into account.  If the value is 1 then the existing  GLIST
              is  ignored.  CMPLST  defaults  to 1 apart from when the <u>--ffmt=FFMT</u> option's value is non-zero in
              which case CMPLST defaults to 0. See the LISTS section below. In most cases  this  bit  should  be
              left at its default value.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--count</b>=<u>COUNT</u>
              where  <u>COUNT</u>  is  the number of blocks to be formatted or media to be resized to. Can be used with
              either <u>--format</u> or <u>--resize</u>.  With <u>--format</u> this option need not be given  in  which  case  it  is
              assumed to be zero.
              With <u>--format</u> the interpretation of <u>COUNT</u> is:
                (<u>COUNT</u>  &gt;  0)  :  only  format the first <u>COUNT</u> blocks and READ CAPACITY will report <u>COUNT</u> blocks
              after format
                (<u>COUNT</u> = 0) and block size unchanged : use existing block count
                (<u>COUNT</u> = 0) and block size changed : recommended maximum block count for new block size
                (<u>COUNT</u> = -1) : use recommended maximum block count
                (<u>COUNT</u>  &lt;  -1)  :  illegal  With  <u>--resize</u>  this  option  must  be  given  and  <u>COUNT</u>  has  this
              interpretation:
                (<u>COUNT</u> &gt; 0) : after resize READ CAPACITY will report <u>COUNT</u> blocks
                (<u>COUNT</u> = 0) : after resize READ CAPACITY will report 0 blocks
                (<u>COUNT</u> = -1) : after resize READ CAPACITY will report its maximum number of blocks
                (<u>COUNT</u> &lt; -1) : illegal
              In  both  cases  if the given <u>COUNT</u> exceeds the maximum number of blocks (for the block size) then
              the disk reports an error.  See NOTES section below.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--dcrt</b>
              this option sets the DCRT bit in the FORMAT UNIT command's parameter list header. It will "disable
              certification". Certification verifies that blocks are usable during  the  format  process.  Using
              this  option  may  speed  the  format but <u>--ffmt=FFMT</u>, if available, would probably be better. The
              default action of this utility (i.e. when this option is not given)  is  to  clear  the  DCRT  bit
              thereby requesting "media certification" (also unless another option needs it, the FOV bit will be
              cleared). When the DCRT bit is set, the FOV bit must also be set hence sg_format does that.
              If  this  option is given twice then certification is enabled by clearing the DCRT bit and setting
              the FOV bit. Both these bits are found in the parameter list associated with the FORMAT UNIT cdb.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>
              this option will parse the command line, do all the preparation but bypass the actual FORMAT UNIT,
              FORMAT WITH PRESET or FORMAT MEDIUM command. Also if the options would otherwise cause the logical
              block size to change, then the MODE SELECT command that would do that is also  bypassed  when  the
              dry run option is given.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--early</b>
              during a format operation, The default action of this utility is to poll the disk every 60 seconds
              (or  every 10 seconds if <u>FFMT</u> is non-zero) to determine the progress of the format operation until
              it is finished. When this option is given this utility will exit "early", that is as soon  as  the
              format  operation  has  commenced.  Then  the  user can monitor the progress of the ongoing format
              operation with other utilities (e.g. <a href="../man8/sg_turs.8.html">sg_turs</a>(8) or <a href="../man8/sg_requests.8.html">sg_requests</a>(8)).  This option  and  <u>--wait</u>  are
              mutually exclusive.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--ffmt</b>=<u>FFMT</u>
              <u>FFMT</u>  (fast  format)  is  placed in a field of the same name in the FORMAT UNIT cdb. The field was
              introduced in SBC-4 revision 10. The default value is 0 which implies the former action  which  is
              typically  to  overwrite all blocks on the <u>DEVICE</u>. That can take a long time (e.g. with hard disks
              over 10 TB in size that can be days). With <u>FFMT</u> set that time may be reduced to minutes  or  less.
              So it is worth trying if it is available.
              <u>FFMT</u>  has values 1 and 2 for fast format with 3 being reserved currently. These two values include
              this description: "The device server initializes the medium ...  without  overwriting  the  medium
              (i.e.  resources  for managing medium access are initialized and the medium is not written)".  The
              difference between 1 and 2 concerns read operations on LBAs to which no data has been written  to,
              after  the fast format. When <u>FFMT</u> is 1 the read operation should return "unspecified logical block
              data" and complete without error. When <u>FFMT</u> is 2 the read  operation  may  yield  check  condition
              status  with  a  sense key set to hardware error, medium error or command aborted. See draft SBC-4
              revision 16 section 4.34 for more details.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--fmtmaxlba</b>
              This option is only active if it is given together with the <u>--preset=ID</u> option. If so it sets  the
              FMTMAXLBA field in the FORMAT WITH PRESET command.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--fmtpinfo</b>=<u>FPI</u>
              sets  the  FMTPINFO field in the FORMAT UNIT cdb to a value between 0 and 3.  The default value is
              0. The FMTPINFO field from SBC-3 revision 16 is a 2 bit field (bits 7 and 6 of byte 1 in the cdb).
              Prior to that revision it was a single bit field (bit 7 of byte 1 in the cdb)  and  there  was  an
              accompanying bit called RTO_REQ (bit 6 of byte 1 in the cdb). The deprecated options "--pinfo" and
              "--rto-req"  represent  the  older  usage.  This  option  should  be  used in their place. See the
              PROTECTION INFORMATION section below for more information.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--format</b>
              issue one of the three SCSI "format" commands. In the absence of  the  <u>--preset=ID</u>  and  <u>--tape=FM</u>
              options, the SCSI FORMAT UNIT command is issued.  <b>These</b> <b>commands</b> <b>will</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b>
              <b>the</b>  <b>media.</b>   This  option  is  required to change the block size of a disk. In the absence of the
              <u>--quick</u> option, the user is given a 15 second count down to  ponder  the  wisdom  of  doing  this,
              during  which time control-C (amongst other Unix commands) can be used to kill this process before
              it does any damage.
              When used three times (or more) the preliminary MODE  SENSE  and  SELECT  commands  are  bypassed,
              leaving  only  the  initial INQUIRY and FORMAT UNIT commands. This is for emergency use (e.g. when
              the MODE SENSE/SELECT commands are not working) and cannot change the logical block size.
              Host managed zoned devices (e.g. many zoned disks) have a different PDT compared  to  other  disks
              but can still be formatted as if they were 'normal' disks.
              See NOTES section for implementation details and EXAMPLES section for typical use.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              print out the usage information then exit.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--ip-def</b>
              sets  the  default Initialization Pattern. Some disks (SSDs) use this to flag that a format should
              fully provision (i.e. associate a physical block with every logical block). The same disks  (SSDs)
              might  thin  provision  if  this  option is not given. If this option is given then the <u>--security</u>
              option cannot be given. Also accepts <u>--ip_def</u> for this option.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--long</b>
              the default action of this utility is to assume 32 bit logical  block  addresses.  With  512  byte
              block size this permits more than 2 terabytes (almost 2 ** 41 bytes) on a single disk. This option
              selects  commands and parameters that allow for 64 bit logical block addresses.  Specifically this
              option sets the "longlba" flag in the MODE SENSE (10) command and uses READ CAPACITY  (16)  rather
              than READ CAPACITY (10). If this option is not given and READ CAPACITY (10) or MODE SELECT detects
              a disk the needs more than 32 bits to represent its logical blocks then it is set internally. This
              option  does  not  set  the  LONGLIST  bit  in the FORMAT UNIT command. The LONGLIST bit is set as
              required depending other parameters (e.g. when '--pie=PIE' is greater than zero).

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--mode</b>=<u>MP</u>
              <u>MP</u> is a mode page number (0 to 62 inclusive) that will be used for reading  and  perhaps  changing
              the device logical block size. The default is 1 which is the Read-Write Error Recovery mode page.
              Preferably  the  chosen  (or default) mode page should be saveable (i.e.  accept the SP bit set in
              the MODE SELECT command used when the logical block size is being changed). Recent version of this
              utility will retry a MODE SELECT if the SP=1 variant fails with a sense key  of  ILLEGAL  REQUEST.
              That retry will use the same MODE SELECT command but with SP=0 .

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--pfu</b>=<u>PFU</u>
              sets  the  "Protection  Field  Usage"  field  in the parameter block associated with a FORMAT UNIT
              command to <u>PFU</u>. The default value is 0, the only other defined  value  currently  is  1.  See  the
              PROTECTION INFORMATION section below for more information.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--pie</b>=<u>PIE</u>
              sets the "Protection Interval Exponent" field in the parameter block associated with a FORMAT UNIT
              command  to  <u>PIE</u>. The default value is 0.  <u>PIE</u> can only be non-zero with protection types 2 and 3.
              The value of 0 is typical for 512 byte blocks;  with  4096  byte  blocks  a  value  of  3  may  be
              appropriate  (i.e.  8 protection intervals interleaved with 4096 bytes of user data). A device may
              not support any non-zero values. This field first appeared in SBC-3 revision 18.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pinfo</b>
              this option is deprecated, use the <u>--fmtpinfo=FPI</u> option instead.  If used, then it sets bit 7  of
              byte  1  in  the FORMAT UNIT cdb and that is equivalent to setting <u>--fmtpinfo=2</u>. [So if <u>--pinfo</u> is
              used (plus <u>--fmtpinfo=FPI</u> and <u>--pfu=PFU</u> are not given or their arguments are  0)  then  protection
              type 1 is selected.]

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--poll</b>=<u>PT</u>
              where  <u>PT</u> is the type of poll used. If <u>PT</u> is 0 then a TEST UNIT READY command is used, otherwise a
              REQUEST SENSE command is used. The default is currently 0 but this will change to 1  in  the  near
              future. See the NOTES sections below.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--preset</b>=<u>ID</u>
              this  option  instructs  this  utility  to  issue  a  SCSI  FORMAT WITH PRESET command. The PRESET
              IDENTIFIER field in that cdb is set to <u>ID</u>. The IMMED field in that cdb  is  also  set  unless  the
              <u>--wait</u> option is also given, in which case it is cleared.

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--quick</b>
              the  default  action  (i.e.  when  the  option  is  not  given)  is to give the user 15 seconds to
              reconsider doing a format operation on the <u>DEVICE</u>.  When this option is given that step (i.e.  the
              15 second warning period) is skipped.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--resize</b>
              rather  than  format  the disk, it can be resized. This means changing the number of blocks on the
              device reported by the READ CAPACITY command.  This option should be used with  the  <u>--count=COUNT</u>
              option.   The  contents  of  all  logical blocks on the media remain unchanged when this option is
              used. This means that any resize operation can be reversed. This option cannot  be  used  together
              with either <u>--format</u> or a <u>--size=LB_SZ</u> whose argument is different to the existing block size.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--rto_req</b>
              The  option  is deprecated, use the <u>--fmtpinfo=FPI</u> option instead.  If used, then it sets bit 6 of
              byte 1 in the FORMAT UNIT cdb.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--security</b>
              sets the "Security Initialization" (SI) bit in the FORMAT UNIT  command's  initialization  pattern
              descriptor within the parameter list. According to SBC-3 the default initialization pattern "shall
              be  written  using a security erasure write technique". See the NOTES section on the SCSI SANITIZE
              command. If this option is given then the <u>--ip_def</u> option cannot be given.

       <b>-6</b>, <b>--six</b>
              Use 6 byte variants of MODE SENSE and MODE SELECT. The default  action  is  to  use  the  10  byte
              variants. Some MO drives need this option set when doing a format.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--size</b>=<u>LB_SZ</u>
              where  <u>LB_SZ</u>  is  the  logical  block size (i.e. number of user bytes in each block) to format the
              device to. The default value is whatever is currently reported by the block descriptor in  a  MODE
              SENSE  command.  If the block size given by this option is different from the current value then a
              MODE SELECT command is used to change it prior to  the  FORMAT  UNIT  command  being  started  (as
              recommended  in  the  SBC  standards). Some SCSI disks have 512 byte logical blocks by default and
              allow an alternate logical block size of 4096 bytes. If the given  size  in  unacceptable  to  the
              disk, most likely an "Invalid field in parameter list" message will appear in sense data (requires
              the use of '-v' to decode sense data).
              Note that formatting a disk to add or remove protection information is not regarded as a change to
              its logical block size so this option should not be used.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--tape</b>=<u>FM</u>
              will  send  a  FORMAT MEDIUM command to the <u>DEVICE</u> with its FORMAT field set to <u>FM</u>. This option is
              used to prepare a tape (i.e. the "medium") in a tape drive for use. Values for <u>FM</u> include 0 to  do
              the "default" format; 1 to partition a volume and 2 to do a default format then partition.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--timeout</b>=<u>SECS</u>
              where  <u>SECS</u>  is  the  FORMAT UNIT, FORMAT WITH PRESET or FORMAT MEDIUM command timeout in seconds.
              <u>SECS</u> will only be used if it exceeds the internal timeout which is 20 seconds if the IMMED bit  is
              set and 72000 seconds (20 hours) or higher if the IMMED bit is not set. If the disk size exceeds 4
              TB  then the timeout value is increased to 144000 seconds (40 hours).  And if it is greater than 8
              TB then the timeout value is increased to 288000 seconds (80 hours). If the  timeout  is  exceeded
              then  the  operating system will typically abort the command. Aborting a command may escalate to a
              LUN reset (or worse). A timeout may also leave the disk or tape format operation  incomplete.  And
              that  may result in the disk or tape being in a "format corrupt" state requiring another format to
              remedy the situation.  So for various reasons command timeouts are best avoided. An alternate long
              option form is <u>--tmo=SECS</u>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output). "-vvv" gives a lot more debug output.

       <b>-y</b>, <b>--verify</b>
              set the VERIFY bit in the FORMAT MEDIUM cdb. The default is that the VERIFY  bit  is  clear.  This
              option is only appropriate for tapes.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print the version string and then exit.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--wait</b>
              the default format action is to set the "IMMED" bit in the FORMAT UNIT command's (short) parameter
              header.  If this option (i.e. <u>--wait</u>) is given then the "IMMED" bit is not set. If <u>--wait</u> is given
              then the FORMAT UNIT, FORMAT WITH PRESET or FORMAT MEDIUM command waits until the format operation
              completes before returning its  response.  This  can  be  many  hours  on  large  disks.  See  the
              <u>--timeout=SECS</u> option.
              Alternatively this option may be useful when used together with <u>--ffmt=FFMT</u> (and <u>FFMT</u> greater than
              0) since the fast format may only be a matter of seconds.

</pre><h4><b>LISTS</b></h4><pre>
       The  SBC-3 draft (revision 20) defines PLIST, CLIST, DLIST and GLIST in section 4.10 on "Medium defects".
       Briefly, the PLIST is the "primary" list of manufacturer detected  defects,  the  CLIST  ("certification"
       list)  contains  those  detected  during the format operation, the DLIST is a list of defects that can be
       given to the format operation. The GLIST is the  grown  list  which  starts  in  the  format  process  as
       CLIST+DLIST  and  can  "grow"  later  due  to  automatic  reallocation (see the ARRE and AWRE bits in the
       Read-Write Error Recovery mode page (see <a href="../man8/sdparm.8.html">sdparm</a>(8))) and use of the SCSI  REASSIGN  BLOCKS  command  (see
       <a href="../man8/sg_reassign.8.html">sg_reassign</a>(8)).

       By  the  SBC-3 standard (following draft revision 36) the CLIST and DLIST had been removed, leaving PLIST
       and GLIST. Only PLIST and GLIST are found in the SBC-4 drafts.

       The CMPLST bit (controlled by the <u>--cmplst=</u>0|1 option) determines whether the existing  GLIST,  when  the
       format  operation is invoked, is taken into account. The sg_format utility sets the FOV bit to zero which
       causes DPRY=0, so the PLIST is taken into account, and DCRT=0, so the CLIST is generated and used  during
       the format process.

       The sg_format utility does not permit a user to provide a defect list (i.e. DLIST).

</pre><h4><b>PROTECTION</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       Protection  Information  (PI)  is  additional information held with logical blocks so that an application
       and/or host bus adapter can check the correctness of those logical blocks. PI is placed in  one  or  more
       protection intervals interleaved in each logical block. Each protection interval follows the user data to
       which  it refers. A protection interval contains 8 bytes made up of a 2 byte "logical block guard" (CRC),
       a 2 byte "logical block application guard", and a 4 byte "logical block reference tag". Devices with  512
       byte  logical  block  size typically have one protection interval appended, making its logical block data
       520 bytes long. Devices with 4096 byte logical block size often have 8 protection intervals spread across
       its logical block data for a total size of 4160 bytes. Note that for all other purposes the logical block
       size is considered to be 512 and 4096 bytes respectively.

       The SBC-3 standard have added several "protection types" to the PI  introduced  in  the  SBC-2  standard.
       SBC-3 defines 4 protection types (types 0 to 3) with protection type 0 meaning no PI is maintained. While
       a  device may support one or more protection types, it can only be formatted with 1 of the 4. To change a
       device's protection type, it must be re-formatted.  For more information see the  Protection  Information
       in section 4.21 of draft SBC-4 revision 16.

       A  device  that  supports PI information (i.e. supports one or more protection types 1, 2 and 3) sets the
       "PROTECT" bit in its standard INQUIRY response. It also sets the SPT field in the  EXTENDED  INQUIRY  VPD
       page  response  to  indicate  which  protection types it supports. Given PROTECT=1 then SPT=0 implies the
       device supports PI type 1 only, SPT=1 implies the device supports PI types 1 and  2,  and  various  other
       non-obvious  mappings  up  to  SPT=7 which implies protection types 1, 2 and 3 are supported. The <b>current</b>
       protection type of a disk can be found in the "P_TYPE" and "PROT_EN" fields in the  response  of  a  READ
       CAPACITY (16) command (e.g. with the 'sg_readcap --long' utility).

       Given  that  a  device  supports a particular protection type, a user can then choose to format that disk
       with that protection type by setting the "FMTPINFO" and "Protection Field Usage"  fields  in  the  FORMAT
       UNIT  command.  Those  fields correspond to the <u>--fmtpinfo=FPI</u> and the <u>--pfu=PFU</u> options in this utility.
       The list below shows the four protection types followed by the options of this utility needed  to  select
       them:
           <b>0</b> : --fmtpinfo=0 --pfu=0
           <b>1</b> : --fmtpinfo=2 --pfu=0
           <b>2</b> : --fmtpinfo=3 --pfu=0
           <b>3</b> : --fmtpinfo=3 --pfu=1
       The default value of <u>FPI</u> (in <u>--fmtpinfo=FPI</u>) is 0 and the default value of <u>PFU</u> (in <u>--pfu=PFU</u>) is 0. So if
       neither <u>--fmtpinfo=FPI</u> nor <u>--pfu=PFU</u> are given then protection type 0 (i.e. no protection information) is
       chosen.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       After  a  format  that  changes  the  logical  block  size or the number of logical blocks on a disk, the
       operating system may need to be told to re-initialize its setting for that disk. In  Linux  that  can  be
       done with:
           echo 1 &gt; /sys/block/sd{letter(s)}/device/rescan
       where  "letter(s)"  will  be  between 'a' and 'zzz'. The lsscsi utility in Linux can be used to check the
       various namings of a disk.

       The SBC-2 standard states that the REQUEST SENSE command should be used for obtaining progress indication
       when the format command is underway.  However, tests on a selection of disks shows that TEST  UNIT  READY
       commands  yield  progress  indications  (but  not REQUEST SENSE commands). So the current version of this
       utility defaults to using TEST UNIT READY commands to poll the disk to  find  out  the  progress  of  the
       format. The <u>--poll=PT</u> option has been added to control this.

       When  the  <u>--format</u>,  <u>--preset=ID</u>  or  <u>--tape=FM</u>  option  is  given  without  the  <u>--wait</u> option then the
       corresponding SCSI command is issued with the IMMED bit set which causes the SCSI command to return after
       it has started the format operation. The <u>--early</u> option will cause  sg_format  to  exit  at  that  point.
       Otherwise the <u>DEVICE</u> is polled every 60 seconds or every 10 seconds if <u>FFMT</u> is non-zero. The poll is with
       TEST UNIT READY or REQUEST SENSE commands until one reports an "all clear" (i.e. the format operation has
       completed).  Normally  these  polling  commands  will  result  in  a  progress  indicator (expressed as a
       percentage) being output to the screen. If  the  user  gets  bored  watching  the  progress  report  then
       sg_format  process  can  be terminated (e.g. with control-C) without affecting the format operation which
       continues. However a target or device reset (or a power cycle) will probably cause the  format  to  cease
       and the <u>DEVICE</u> to become "format corrupt".

       When  the <u>--format</u> (<u>--preset=ID</u> or <u>--tape</u>) and <u>--wait</u> options are both given then this utility may take a
       long time to return. In this case care should be taken not to send any other SCSI commands to the disk as
       it may not respond leaving those commands queued behind the active  format  command.  This  may  cause  a
       timeout  in  the  OS driver (in a lot shorter period than 20 hours applicable to some format operations).
       This may result in the OS resetting the disk leaving the format operation incomplete. This may leave  the
       disk  in  a  "format corrupt" state requiring another format to remedy the situation. Modern SCSI devices
       should yield a "not ready" sense key with an additional sense indicating a format is  in  progress.  With
       older devices the user should take precautions that nothing attempts to access a device while it is being
       formatted.  Unmounting  in  mounted  file  systems  on a <u>DEVICE</u> prior to calling this utility is strongly
       advised.

       When the block size (i.e. the number of bytes in each block) is changed on a disk two SCSI commands  must
       be  sent: a MODE SELECT to change the block size followed by a FORMAT command. If the MODE SELECT command
       succeeds and the FORMAT fails then the disk may be in a state that the standard calls "format corrupt". A
       block descriptor in a subsequent MODE SENSE will report  the  requested  new  block  size  while  a  READ
       CAPACITY  command  will  report  the existing (i.e. previous) block size. Alternatively the READ CAPACITY
       command may fail, reporting the device is not ready, potentially requiring a format. The solution to this
       situation is to do a format again (and this time the new block size does not have to be given) or  change
       the block size back to the original size.

       The  SBC-2 standard states that the block count can be set back to the manufacturer's maximum recommended
       value in a format or resize operation.  This can be done by placing an address of 0xffffffff (or  the  64
       bit  equivalent)  in  the  appropriate  block descriptor field to a MODE SELECT command. In signed (two's
       complement) arithmetic that value corresponds to '-1'. So a --count=-1 causes the block count to  be  set
       back  to  the  manufacturer's  maximum  recommended  value.  To see exactly which SCSI commands are being
       executed and parameters passed add the "-vvv" option to the sg_format command line.

       The FMTDATA field shown in the FORMAT UNIT cdb does not have a corresponding option in this utility. When
       set in the cdb it indicates an additional parameter list will be sent to the <u>DEVICE</u> along with  the  cdb.
       It is set as required, basically when any field in the parameter list header is set.

       Short  stroking  is a technique to trade off capacity for performance on hard disks. "Hard" disk is often
       used to mean a storage device with spinning platters which contain the user data. Solid State Disk  (SSD)
       is  the  newer  form  of  storage  device that contains no moving parts. Hard disk performance is usually
       highest on the outer tracks (usually the lower logical block addresses) so by resizing or reformatting  a
       disk to a smaller capacity, average performance will usually be increased.

       Other  utilities may be useful in finding information associated with formatting. These include <a href="../man8/sg_inq.8.html">sg_inq</a>(8)
       to fetch standard INQUIRY information (e.g. the PROTECT bit) and to fetch the EXTENDED INQUIRY  VPD  page
       (e.g.  RTO  and GRD_CHK bits). The <a href="../man8/sdparm.8.html">sdparm</a>(8) utility can be used to access and potentially change the now
       obsolete format mode page.

       scsiformat is another utility available for formatting SCSI disks with Linux. It dates  from  1997  (most
       recent update) and may be useful for disks whose firmware is of that vintage.

       The  <u>COUNT</u>  numeric  argument  may  include  a  multiplicative suffix or be given in hexadecimal. See the
       "NUMERIC ARGUMENTS" section in the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

       The SCSI SANITIZE command was introduced in SBC-3 revision 27. It is closely related to the ATA  sanitize
       disk  feature  set and can be used to remove all existing data from a disk. Sanitize is more likely to be
       implemented on modern disks (including SSDs) than FORMAT UNIT's security initialization feature (see  the
       <u>--security</u> option) and in some cases much faster.

       SSDs  that  support thin provisioning will typically unmap all logical blocks during a format. The reason
       is to improve the SSD's endurance. Also thin provisioned formats typically  complete  faster  than  fully
       provisioned  ones  on  the  same disk (see the <u>--ip_def</u> option). In either case format operations on SSDs
       tend to be a lot faster than they are on hard disks with spinning media.

       Host managed zoned devices (aka zoned disks) have a different Peripheral Device  Type  [PDT=20  or  0x14]
       from  normal  disks.  They  can be considered as a superset of normal disks (e.g. SSDs and hard disks) at
       least from the perspective of the number of SCSI commands they support. Typically they can  be  formatted
       just  like  other SCSI disks. They have their own T10 standards: ZBC standard (INCITS 536-2016) and draft
       ZBC-2.
       Two other zoned disk variants ("host aware" and "Domains and Realms") use the same  PDT  as  other  disks
       (i.e. PDT=0) and can be formatted by this utility as if they were normal disks.

</pre><h4><b>TAPE</b></h4><pre>
       Tape  system  use  a variant of the FORMAT UNIT command used on disks. Tape systems use the FORMAT MEDIUM
       command which is simpler with only three fields in the cdb typically used. Apart from  sharing  the  same
       opcode  the cdbs of FORMAT UNIT and FORMAT MEDIUM are quite different. FORMAT MEDIUM's fields are VERIFY,
       IMMED and FORMAT (with TRANSFER LENGTH always set to 0).  The VERIFY bit field is set with  the  <u>--verify</u>
       option. The IMMED bit is manipulated by the <u>--wait</u> option in the same way it is for disks; one difference
       is  that  if  the  <u>--poll=PT</u> option is not given then it defaults to <u>PT</u> of 1 which means the poll is done
       with REQUEST SENSE commands.

       The argument given to the <u>--tape=FM</u> option is used to set the FORMAT field. <u>FM</u> can take values from  "-1"
       to  "15" where "-1" (the default) means don't do a tape format; value "8" to "15" are for vendor specific
       formats. The <u>--early</u> option may also be used to set the IMMED bit and then exit this utility (rather than
       poll periodically until it is finished). In this case the tape drive will still be busy doing the  format
       for  some  time  but,  according  to  T10,  should  still  respond in full to the INQUIRY and REPORT LUNS
       commands. Other commands (including REQUEST  SENSE)  should  yield  a  "not  ready"  sense  key  with  an
       additional  sense code of "Logical unit not ready, format in progress". Additionally REQUEST SENSE should
       contain a progress indication in its sense data.

       When <u>FM</u> is 1 or 2 then the settings in the Medium partition mode page control the partitioning. That mode
       page can be viewed and modified with the sdparm utility.

       Prior to invoking this utility the tape may need to be positioned to the beginning  of  partition  0.  In
       Linux that can typically be done with the mt utility (e.g. 'mt -f /dev/st0 rewind').

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       These examples use Linux device names. For suitable device names in other supported Operating Systems see
       the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

       In  the first example below simply find out the existing block count and size derived from two sources: a
       block descriptor in a MODE SELECT command response and from the response of a READ CAPACITY commands.  No
       changes are made:

          # sg_format /dev/sdm

       Now  a  simple format, leaving the block count and size as they were previously.  The FORMAT UNIT command
       is executed in IMMED mode and the device is polled every 60 seconds to print out a progress indication:

          # sg_format --format /dev/sdm

       Now the same format, but waiting (passively) until the format operation is complete:

          # sg_format --format --wait /dev/sdm

       Next is a format in which the block size is changed to 520 bytes and  the  block  count  is  set  to  the
       manufacturer's maximum value (for that block size). Note, not all disks support changing the block size:

          # sg_format --format --size=520 /dev/sdm

       Now  a  resize  operation  so  that  only  the first 0x10000 (65536) blocks on a disk are accessible. The
       remaining blocks remain unaltered.

          # sg_format --resize --count=0x10000 /dev/sdm

       Now resize the disk back to its normal (maximum) block count:

          # sg_format --resize --count=-1 /dev/sdm

       One reason to format a SCSI disk is to add protection information. First check which protection types are
       supported by a disk (by checking the SPT field in the Extended inquiry VPD page together with the Protect
       bit in the standard inquiry response):

          # sg_vpd -p ei -l /dev/sdb
          extended INQUIRY data VPD page:
            ACTIVATE_MICROCODE=0
            SPT=1 [protection types 1 and 2 supported]
            ....

       Format with type 1 protection:

          # sg_format --format --fmtpinfo=2 /dev/sdm

       After a successful format with type 1 protection, READ <a href="../man16/CAPACITY.16.html">CAPACITY</a>(16) should show something like this:

          # sg_readcap -l /dev/sdm
          Read Capacity results:
             Protection: prot_en=1, p_type=0, p_i_exponent=0 [type 1 protection]
             Logical block provisioning: lbpme=0, lbprz=0
             ....

       To format with type 3 protection:

          # sg_format --format --fmtpinfo=3 --pfu=1 /dev/sdm

       For the disk shown above this will probably fail because the Extended inquiry VPD page showed only  types
       1 and 2 protection are supported.

       Here  are examples of using fast format (FFMT field in FORMAT UNIT cdb) to quickly switch between 512 and
       4096 byte logical block size. Assume disk starts with 4096 byte logical block size and all important data
       has been backed up.

          # sg_format --format --ffmt=1 --size=512 /dev/sdd

       Now /dev/sdd should have 512 byte logical block size. And to switch it back:

          # sg_format --format --ffmt=1 --size=4096 /dev/sdd

       Since fast formats can be very quick (a matter of seconds) using the --wait option may be appropriate.

       And to use the Format with preset command this invocation could be used:

          # sg_format --preset=1 --fmtmaxlba /dev/sdd

       The FORMAT PRESETS VPD page (0xb8) should be consulted to check that Preset identifier 0x1 is  there  and
       has the expected format (i.e. "default host aware zoned block device model with 512 bytes of user data in
       each logical block").  That VPD page can be viewed with the sg_vpd utility.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The  exit status of sg_format is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page. Unless
       the <u>--wait</u> option is given, the exit status may not reflect the  success  of  otherwise  of  the  format.
       Using <a href="../man8/sg_turs.8.html">sg_turs</a>(8) and <a href="../man8/sg_readcap.8.html">sg_readcap</a>(8) after the format operation may be wise.

       The  Unix  convention  is  that "no news is good news" but that can be a bit unnerving after an operation
       like format, especially if it finishes quickly (i.e. before the first progress poll is sent). Giving  the
       <u>--verbose</u> option once should supply enough additional output to settle those nerves.
