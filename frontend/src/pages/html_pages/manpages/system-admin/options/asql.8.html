          --load       Load the named file, or glob.
          --execute    Execute a single query then exit.

         Options:

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
         asql provides a simple console interface to allow a user to
        query the contents of an Apache logfile via an SQL interface.

         The shell features include:

       Persistent alias definitions.
       Command line completion
       Command history
       Simple scriptability

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
         The asql shell will create a temporary SQLite database based upon
        any number of Apache logfiles.  This temporary database may then
        be interactively queried using common SQL syntax.

         To get started you should load your logfiles into the database:

          load /var/log/apache2/acces*

         (The tool will automatically decompress files which have been
        compressed with gzip or bzip2.)

         Once you've loaded at least one file you may run queries, for
        example:

         SELECT source,COUNT(id),SUM(size) AS Number FROM logs GROUP BY source ORDER BY Number DESC, source

       This  example  will  show  the number of requests each distinct IP address has made, along with the total
       size of the files they've requested.

       As you can see we've selected three columns "source", COUNT(id), and  "SUM(size)".   You  may  see  which
       other columns are available via the "show" command.

       Because  parsing  the  Apache logfile(s) specified might be quite slow there is the option of dumping the
       temporary SQLite database to a known filename with the 'save' command.  The analog to the save command is
       the 'restore' command, which will read in an existing SQLite database and  allow  future  queries  to  be
       executed against it.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       When  the  shell  starts  up it will read and intepret the initialisation file of <a href="file:~/.asqlrc">~/.asqlrc</a> if it exists.
       Any commands present in that file will be executed prior to the launch of the interactive session.

       All aliases will be read and written to the file <a href="file:~/.asql.aliases.">~/.asql.aliases.</a>

       All interactive history will be written to the file <a href="file:~/.asql.">~/.asql.</a>
