       sg_write_same - send SCSI WRITE SAME command

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sg_write_same</b>  [<u>--10</u>]  [<u>--16</u>]  [<u>--32</u>]  [<u>--anchor</u>]  [<u>--ff</u>]  [<u>--grpnum=GN</u>]  [<u>--help</u>]  [<u>--in=IF</u>] [<u>--lba=LBA</u>]

       [<u>--wrprotect=WPR</u>] [<u>--xferlen=LEN</u>] <u>DEVICE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Send  the  SCSI WRITE SAME (10, 16 or 32 byte) command to <u>DEVICE</u>. This command writes the given block <u>NUM</u>
       times to consecutive blocks on the <u>DEVICE</u> starting at logical block address <u>LBA</u>.

       The length of the block to be written multiple times is obtained from either the  <u>LEN</u>  argument,  or  the
       length  of  the given input file <u>IF</u>, or by calling READ <a href="../man16/CAPACITY.16.html">CAPACITY</a>(16) on <u>DEVICE</u>. The contents of the block
       to be written are obtained from the input file <u>IF</u> or zeros are  used.  If  READ  <a href="../man16/CAPACITY.16.html">CAPACITY</a>(16)  is  called
       (which  implies  <u>IF</u>  was not given) and the PROT_EN bit is set then an extra 8 bytes (i.e.  more than the
       logical block size) of 0xff are sent. If READ <a href="../man16/CAPACITY.16.html">CAPACITY</a>(16)  fails  then  READ  <a href="../man10/CAPACITY.10.html">CAPACITY</a>(10)  is  used  to
       determine the block size.

       If  neither  <u>--10</u>,  <u>--16</u>  nor  <u>--32</u>  is  given  then  WRITE  <a href="../man10/SAME.10.html">SAME</a>(10) is sent unless one of the following
       conditions is met.  If <u>LBA</u> (plus <u>NUM</u>) exceeds 32 bits, <u>NUM</u> exceeds 65535, or the <u>--unmap</u> option is  given
       then WRITE <a href="../man16/SAME.16.html">SAME</a>(16) is sent.  The <u>--10</u>, <u>--16</u> and <u>--32</u> options are mutually exclusive.

       SBC-3  revision  35d introduced a "No Data-Out Buffer" (NDOB) bit which, if set, bypasses the requirement
       to send a single block of data to the <u>DEVICE</u> together with the command. Only WRITE SAME (16 and 32  byte)
       support  the NDOB bit. If given, a user block of zeros is assumed; if required, protection information of
       0xffs is assumed.

       In SBC-3 revision 26 the UNMAP and ANCHOR bits were added to the WRITE SAME (10) command. Since the UNMAP
       bit has been in WRITE SAME (16) and WRITE SAME (32) since SBC-3 revision 18, the lower of the  two  (i.e.
       WRITE  SAME  (16)) is the default when the <u>--unmap</u> option is given.  To send WRITE SAME (10) use the <u>--10</u>
       option.

       <b>Take</b> <b>care:</b> The WRITE SAME(10, 16 and 32) commands may interpret a <u>NUM</u> of zero as  write  to  the  end  of
       <u>DEVICE</u>.  This  utility  defaults <u>NUM</u> to 1 .  The WRITE SAME commands have no IMMED bit so if <u>NUM</u> is large
       (or zero) then an invocation of this utility could take a long time, potentially as long as a FORMAT UNIT
       command. In such situations the command timeout value <u>TO</u> may need to be increased from its default  value
       of  60  seconds. In SBC-3 revision 26 the WSNZ (write same no zero) bit was added to the Block Limits VPD
       page [0xB0]. If set the WRITE SAME commands will not accept a <u>NUM</u> of zero. The same SBC-3 revision  added
       the "Maximum Write Same Length" field to the Block Limits VPD page.

       The  Logical Block Provisioning VPD page [0xB2] contains the LBPWS and LBPWS10 bits. If LBPWS is set then
       WRITE SAME (16) supports the UNMAP bit.  If LBPWS10 is set then WRITE SAME (10) supports the  UNMAP  bit.
       If  either LBPWS or LBPWS10 is set and the WRITE SAME (32) is supported then WRITE SAME (32) supports the
       UNMAP bit.

       As a precaution against an accidental  'sg_write_same  /dev/sda'  (for  example)  overwriting  LBA  0  on
       /dev/sda with zeros, at least one of the <u>--in=IF</u>, <u>--lba=LBA</u> or <u>--num=NUM</u> options must be given. Obviously
       this utility can destroy a lot of user data so check the options carefully.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments  to  long  options  are  mandatory  for  short  options  as  well.  The options are arranged in
       alphabetical order based on the long option name.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--10</b>
              send a SCSI WRITE SAME (10) command to <u>DEVICE</u>. The ability  to  set  the  <u>--unmap</u>  (and  <u>--anchor</u>)
              options to this command was added in SBC-3 revision 26.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--16</b>
              send a SCSI WRITE SAME (16) command to <u>DEVICE</u>.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--32</b>
              send a SCSI WRITE SAME (32) command to <u>DEVICE</u>.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--anchor</b>
              sets  the ANCHOR bit in the cdb. Introduced in SBC-3 revision 22.  That draft requires the <u>--unmap</u>
              option to also be specified.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--ff</b>
              the data-out buffer sent with this command is initialized with 0xff  bytes  when  this  option  is
              given.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--grpnum</b>=<u>GN</u>
              sets  the 'Group number' field to <u>GN</u>. Defaults to a value of zero.  <u>GN</u> should be a value between 0
              and 63.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              output the usage message then exit.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--in</b>=<u>IF</u>
              read data (binary) from file named <u>IF</u> and use it as the data-out buffer for the  SCSI  WRITE  SAME
              command.  The  length of the data-out buffer is <u>--xferlen=LEN</u> or, if that is not given, the length
              of the <u>IF</u> file. If <u>IF</u> is "-" then stdin is read. If this option and the <u>--ff</u> are  not  given  then
              0x00  bytes are used as fill with the length of the data-out buffer obtained from <u>--xferlen=LEN</u> or
              by calling READ CAPACITY(16 or 10).  If the response to READ <a href="../man16/CAPACITY.16.html">CAPACITY</a>(16) has the PROT_EN bit  set
              then data- out buffer size is modified accordingly with the last 8 bytes set to 0xff.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--lba</b>=<u>LBA</u>
              where  <u>LBA</u>  is the logical block address to start the WRITE SAME command.  Defaults to lba 0 which
              is a dangerous block to overwrite on a disk that is in  use.  Assumed  to  be  in  decimal  unless
              prefixed with '0x' or has a trailing 'h'.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--lbdata</b>
              sets  the  LBDATA  bit  in  the WRITE SAME cdb. This bit was made obsolete in sbc3r32 in September
              2012.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--ndob</b>
              sets the NDOB bit in the WRITE SAME (16 and 32 byte) commands. NDOB stands for No Data-Out Buffer.
              Default is to clear this bit.  When  this  option  is  given  then  <u>--in=IF</u>  is  not  allowed  and
              <u>--xferlen=LEN</u> can only be given if <u>LEN</u> is 0 .
              By  default  zeros  are  written  in  each  block,  but  it  is  possible  that  the "provisioning
              initialization pattern" is written depending on other settings.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--num</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              where <u>NUM</u> is the number of blocks, starting at <u>LBA</u>, to write the data-out buffer to.  The  default
              value  for  <u>NUM</u>  is  1. The value corresponds to the 'Number of logical blocks' field in the WRITE
              SAME cdb.
              Note that a value of 0 in <u>NUM</u> may be interpreted as write  the  data-out  buffer  on  every  block
              starting  at  <u>LBA</u> to the end of the <u>DEVICE</u>.  If the WSNZ bit (introduced in sbc3r26, January 2011)
              in the Block Limits VPD page is set then the value of 0 is disallowed, yielding an Invalid request
              sense key.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--pbdata</b>
              sets the PBDATA bit in the WRITE SAME cdb. This bit was made  obsolete  in  sbc3r32  in  September
              2012.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--timeout</b>=<u>TO</u>
              where <u>TO</u> is the command timeout value in seconds. The default value is 60 seconds. If <u>NUM</u> is large
              (or zero) a WRITE SAME command may require considerably more time than 60 seconds to complete.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--unmap</b>
              sets the UNMAP bit in the WRITE SAME(10, 16 and 32) cdb. See UNMAP section below.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase the degree of verbosity (debug messages).

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              output version string then exit.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--wrprotect</b>=<u>WPR</u>
              sets the "Write protect" field in the WRITE SAME cdb to <u>WPR</u>. The default value is zero. <u>WPR</u> should
              be  a  value  between  0  and 7.  When <u>WPR</u> is 1 or greater, and the disk's protection type is 1 or
              greater, then 8 extra bytes of protection information are expected or generated (to place  in  the
              command's data-out buffer).

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--xferlen</b>=<u>LEN</u>
              where  <u>LEN</u> is the data-out buffer length. Defaults to the length of the <u>IF</u> file or, if that is not
              given, then the READ CAPACITY(16 or 10) command is used to  find  the  'Logical  block  length  in
              bytes'.  That  figure  may be increased by 8 bytes if the <u>DEVICE</u>'s protection type is 1 or greater
              and the WRPROTECT field (see <u>--wrprotect=WPR</u>) is 1 or greater. If both  this  option  and  the  <u>IF</u>
              option  are given and <u>LEN</u> exceeds the length of the <u>IF</u> file then <u>LEN</u> is the data-out buffer length
              with zeros used as pad bytes.

</pre><h4><b>UNMAP</b></h4><pre>
       Logical block provisioning is a new term introduced in SBC-3 revision 25 for the ability to  mark  blocks
       as  unused.  For  large  storage  arrays,  it  is  a way to provision less physical storage than the READ
       CAPACITY command reports is available, potentially allocating more physical storage when  WRITE  commands
       require  it.  For  flash  memory  (e.g.  SSD drives) it is a way of potentially saving power (and perhaps
       access time) when it is known large sections (or almost all) of the flash memory is not in use. SSDs need
       wear levelling algorithms to have acceptable endurance and typically over  provision  to  simplify  those
       algorithms;  hence  they  typically  contain  more  physical  flash storage than their logical size would
       dictate.

       Support for logical block provisioning is indicated by the LBPME bit being set in the  READ  <a href="../man16/CAPACITY.16.html">CAPACITY</a>(16)
       command  response (see the sg_readcap utility).  That implies at least one of the UNMAP or WRITE <a href="../man16/SAME.16.html">SAME</a>(16)
       commands is implemented. If the UNMAP command is implemented then  the  "Maximum  unmap  LBA  count"  and
       "Maximum  unmap  block  descriptor count" fields in the Block Limits VPD page should both be greater than
       zero. The READ <a href="../man16/CAPACITY.16.html">CAPACITY</a>(16) command response also contains a  LBPRZ  bit  which  if  set  means  that  if
       unmapped  blocks  are  read  then  zeros  will be returned for the data (and if protection information is
       active, 0xff bytes are returned for that). In SBC-3 revision 27 the same  LBPRZ  bit  was  added  to  the
       Logical Block Provisioning VPD page.

       In  SBC-3  revision  25 the LBPU and ANC_SUP bits where added to the Logical Block Provisioning VPD page.
       When LBPU is set it indicates that the device supports the UNMAP command (see the sg_unmap utility). When
       the ANC_SUP bit is set it indicates the device supports anchored LBAs.

       When the UNMAP bit is set in the cdb then the data-out  buffer  is  also  sent.   Additionally  the  data
       section  of  that data-out buffer should be full of 0x0 bytes while the data protection block, 8 bytes at
       the end if present, should be set to 0xff bytes. If these conditions are not met and the LBPRZ bit is set
       then the UNMAP bit is ignored and the data-out buffer is written to the <u>DEVICE</u> as if the  UNMAP  bit  was
       zero.  In the absence of the <u>--in=IF</u> option, this utility will attempt build a data-out buffer that meets
       the requirements for the UNMAP bit in the cdb to be acted on by the <u>DEVICE</u>.

       Logical blocks may also be unmapped by the SCSI UNMAP and FORMAT UNIT  commands  (see  the  sg_unmap  and
       sg_format utilities).

       The  unmap  capability  in SCSI is closely related to the ATA DATA SET MANAGEMENT command with the "Trim"
       bit set. That ATA trim capability does not interact well with SATA command queueing  known  as  NCQ.  T13
       have  introduced  a  new command called the SFQ DATA SET MANAGEMENT command also with a the "Trim" bit to
       address that problem. The SCSI WRITE SAME with the UNMAP bit set and the UNMAP commands do not  have  any
       problems with SCSI queueing.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Various  numeric arguments (e.g. <u>LBA</u>) may include multiplicative suffixes or be given in hexadecimal. See
       the "NUMERIC ARGUMENTS" section in the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

       In Linux, prior to lk 3.17, the sg driver did not support cdb sizes greater than 16 bytes. Hence a device
       node like /dev/sg1 which is associated with the sg driver would fail with this utility if the <u>--32</u> option
       was given (or implied by other options). The bsg driver with  device  nodes  like  /dev/bsg/6:0:0:1  does
       support cdb sizes greater than 16 bytes since its introduction in lk 2.6.28 .

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_write_same is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       BEWARE:  all these examples will overwrite the data on one or more blocks, potentially CLEARING the WHOLE
       DISK.

       One simple usage is to write blocks of zero from (and including) a given LBA for 63 blocks:

         sg_write_same --lba=0x1234 --num=63 /dev/sdc

       Since <u>--xferlen=LEN</u> has not been given, then this utility will call the READ CAPACITY command on /dev/sdc
       to determine the number of bytes in a logical block.  Let us assume that is 512 bytes. Since  <u>--in=IF</u>  is
       not  given  a  block of zeros is assumed. So 63 blocks of zeros (each block containing 512 bytes) will be
       written from (and including) LBA 0x1234 . Note that only one block of zeros is passed to the  SCSI  WRITE
       SAME  command  in  the data-out buffer (as required by SBC-3). Using the WRITE SAME SCSI command to write
       one or more blocks blocks of zeros is equivalent to the NVMe command: Write Zeroes.
       Now we will write zero blocks to the WHOLE disk. [Note sanitize type commands will also clear blocks  and
       metadata that are not directly visible]:

         sg_write_same --lba=0x0 --num=0 /dev/sdc

       Yes,  in  this  context --num=0 means the rest of the disk. The above invocation may give an error due to
       the WSNZ bit in the Block Limits VPD page being set. To get around that try:

         sg_write_same --lba=0x0 --ndob /dev/sdc

       this invocation, if supported, has the added benefit of not sending a data out  buffer  of  zeros.  Notes
       that  it  is  possible that the "provisioning initialization pattern" is written to each block instead of
       zeros.

       A similar example follows but in this case the blocks are "unmapped" ("trimmed" in ATA speak) rather than
       zeroed:

         sg_write_same --unmap -L 0x1234 -n 63 /dev/sdc

       Note that if the LBPRZ bit in the READ <a href="../man16/CAPACITY.16.html">CAPACITY</a>(16) response is  set  (i.e.   LPPRZ  is  an  acronym  for
       logical  block provisioning read zeros) then these two examples do the same thing, at least seen from the
       point of view of subsequent reads.

       This utility can also be used to write protection information (PI) on disks formatted with  a  protection
       type  greater  than  zero.  PI is 8 bytes of extra data appended to the user data of a logical block: the
       first two bytes are a CRC (the "guard"), the next two bytes are the "application tag" and the  last  four
       bytes  are  the  "reference tag". With protection types 1 and 2 if the application tag is 0xffff then the
       guard should not be checked (against the user data).

       In this example we assume the logical block size (of the user data) is 512 bytes and the  disk  has  been
       formatted with protection type 1. Since we are going to modify LBA 2468 then we take a copy of it first:

         dd if=/dev/sdb skip=2468 bs=512 of=2468.bin count=1

       The following command line sets the user data to zeros and the PI to 8 0xFF bytes on LBA 2468:

         sg_write_same --lba=2468 /dev/sdb

       Reading  back  that block should be successful because the application tag is 0xffff which suppresses the
       guard (CRC) check (which would otherwise be wrong):

         dd if=/dev/sdb skip=2468 bs=512 of=/dev/null count=1

       Now an attempt is made to create a binary file with zeros in the user data, 0x0000 in the application tag
       and 0xff bytes in the other two PI fields. It is awkward to create 0xff bytes in a file (in Unix) as  the
       "tr" command below shows:

         dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=512 of=ud.bin
         tr "\000" "\377" &lt; /dev/zero | dd bs=1 of=ff_s.bin count=8
         cat ud.bin ff_s.bin &gt; lb.bin
         dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=2 seek=514 conv=notrunc of=lb.bin

       The resulting file can be viewed with 'hexdump -C lb.bin' and should contain 520 bytes. Now that file can
       be written to LBA 2468 as follows:

         sg_write_same --lba=2468 wrprotect=3 --in=lb.bin /dev/sdb

       Note  the  <u>--wrprotect=3</u> rather than being set to 1, since we want the WRITE SAME command to succeed even
       though the PI data now indicates the user data is corrupted. When an attempt is made to read the LBA,  an
       error should occur:

         dd if=/dev/sdb skip=2468 bs=512 of=/dev/null count=1

       dd errors are not very expressive, if dmesg is checked there should be a line something like this: "[sdb]
       Add.  Sense:  Logical  block  guard  check  failed". The block can be corrected by doing a "sg_write_same
       --lba=1234 /dev/sdb" again or restoring the original contents of that LBA:

         dd if=2468.bin bs=512 seek=2468 of=/dev/sdb conv=notrunc count=1

       Hopefully the dd command would never try to truncate the output file when it is a block device.
