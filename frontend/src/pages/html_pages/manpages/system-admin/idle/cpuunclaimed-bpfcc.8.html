</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cpuunclaimed - Sample CPU run queues and calculate unclaimed idle CPU. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cpuunclaimed</b> [-T] [-j] [-J] [interval [count]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This tool samples the length of the run queues and determine when there are idle CPUs, yet queued threads
       waiting their turn. It reports the amount of idle (yet unclaimed by waiting threads) CPU as a system-wide
       percentage.

       This situation can happen for a number of reasons:

       -      An  application  has  been  bound to some, but not all, CPUs, and has runnable threads that cannot
              migrate to other CPUs due to this configuration.

       -      CPU affinity: an optimization that leaves threads on CPUs where the CPU caches are warm,  even  if
              this  means  short  periods  of  waiting while other CPUs are idle. The wait period is tunale (see
              sysctl, kernel.sched*).

       -      Scheduler bugs.

       An unclaimed idle of &lt; 1% is likely to be CPU affinity, and not usually a cause for concern.  By  leaving
       the  CPU idle, overall throughput of the system may be improved. This tool is best for identifying larger
       issues, &gt; 2%, due to the coarseness of its 99 Hertz samples.

       This is an experimental tool that currently works  by  use  of  sampling  to  keep  overheads  low.  Tool
       assumptions:

       -      CPU samples consistently fire around the same offset. There will sometimes be a lag as a sample is
              delayed  by  higher-priority interrupts, but it is assumed the subsequent samples will catch up to
              the expected offsets (as is seen in practice). You can use -J  to  inspect  sample  offsets.  Some
              systems  can  power  down  CPUs  when idle, and when they wake up again they may begin firing at a
              skewed offset: this tool will detect the skew, print an error, and exit.

       -      All CPUs are online (see ncpu).

       If this identifies unclaimed CPU, you can double check it by dumping raw samples (-j), as well  as  using
       other  tracing  tools  to  instrument  scheduler  events  (although  this latter approach has much higher
       overhead).

       Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       CONFIG_BPF and bcc.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Sample and calculate unclaimed idle CPUs, output every 1 second (default:
              # <b>cpuunclaimed</b>

       Print 5 second summaries, 10 times:
              # <b>cpuunclaimed</b> <b>5</b> <b>10</b>

       Print 1 second summaries with timestamps:
              # <b>cpuunclaimed</b> <b>-T</b> <b>1</b>

       Raw dump of all samples (verbose), as comma-separated values:
              # <b>cpuunclaimed</b> <b>-j</b>

</pre><h4><b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       %CPU   CPU utilization as a system-wide percentage.

       unclaimed idle
              Percentage of CPU resources that were idle when work was queued on other CPUs,  as  a  system-wide
              percentage.

       TIME   Time (HH:MM:SS)

       TIMESTAMP_ns
              Timestamp, nanoseconds.

       CPU#   CPU ID.

       OFFSET_ns_CPU#
              Time offset that a sample fired within a sample group for this CPU.

</pre><h4><b>OVERHEAD</b></h4><pre>
       The overhead is expected to be low/negligible as this tool uses sampling at 99 Hertz (on all CPUs), which
       has  a fixed and low cost, rather than sampling every scheduler event as many other approaches use (which
       can involve instrumenting millions of events per second). Sampled CPUs, run queue lengths, and timestamps
       are written to ring buffers that are periodically read by user space for reporting. Measure overhead in a
       test environment.

</pre><h4><b>SOURCE</b></h4><pre>
       This is from bcc.

       Also look in the bcc distribution for a companion _examples.txt file containing  example  usage,  output,
       and commentary for this tool.
