</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sg_test_rwbuf - test a SCSI host adapter by issuing dummy writes and reads

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sg_test_rwbuf</b>   [<u>--addrd=AR</u>]   [<u>--addwr=AW</u>]   [<u>--help</u>]   [<u>--quick</u>]  <u>--size=SZ</u>  [<u>--times=NUM</u>]  [<u>--verbose</u>]
       [<u>--version</u>] <u>DEVICE</u>

       or an older deprecated format <b>sg_test_rwbuf</b> <u>DEVICE</u> <u>SZ</u> [<u>AW</u>] [<u>AR</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       sg_test_rwbuf writes and reads back <u>SZ</u>  bytes  to  the  internal  buffer  of  <u>DEVICE</u>  (e.g.  /dev/sda  or
       /dev/sg0).  A  pseudo  random  pattern is written to the data buffer on the device then read back. If the
       same pattern is found 'Success' is reported. If they do  not  match  (checksums  unequal)  then  this  is
       reported  and up to 24 bytes from the first point of mismatch are reported; the first line shows what was
       written and the second line shows what was received. For testing purposes, you can ask it to write <u>AW</u>  or
       read <u>AR</u> additional bytes.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--addrd</b>=<u>AR</u>
              Read  an  additional  <u>AR</u>  bytes  (more  than  indicated  by  <u>SZ</u>) from the data buffer. Checksum is
              performed over the first <u>SZ</u> bytes.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--addwr</b>=<u>AW</u>
              Write an additional <u>AW</u> bytes (more than indicated by <u>SZ</u>) of zeros into the data  buffer.  Checksum
              is generated over the first <u>SZ</u> bytes.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print out a usage message the exit.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quick</b>
              Perform  a READ BUFFER descriptor command to find out the available data buffer length and offset,
              print them out then exit (without testing with write/read sequences).

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--size</b>=<u>SZ</u>
              where <u>SZ</u> is the size of buffer in bytes to be written then read and checked. This number needs  to
              be  less  than or equal to the size of the device's data buffer which can be seen from the <u>--quick</u>
              option.  Either this option or the <u>--quick</u> option should be given.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--times</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              where <u>NUM</u> is the number of times to repeat the write/read to buffer test. Default value is 1 .

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase verbosity of output.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print version number (and data of last change) then exit.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The microcode in a SCSI device is _not_ modified by doing a WRITE BUFFER command with  its  mode  set  to
       "data"  (0x2)  as done by this utility. Therefore this utility is safe in that respect. [Mode values 0x4,
       0x5, 0x6 and 0x7 are the dangerous ones :-)]

       <b>WARNING</b>: If you access the device at the same time (e.g. because it's a hard disk  with  a  mounted  file
       system  on  it) the device's buffer may be used by the device itself for other data at the same time, and
       overwriting it may or may not cause data corruption! <b>HOWEVER</b> the SPC-3 draft standard does state  in  its
       WRITE  BUFFER command: "This command shall not alter any medium of the logical unit when data mode ... is
       specified". This implies that it _is_ safe to use this  utility  with  devices  that  have  mounted  file
       systems  on  them.   Following  this theme further, a disk with active mounted file systems may cause the
       data read back to be different (due to caching activity) to what was written and hence a checksum error.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_test_rwbuf is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.
