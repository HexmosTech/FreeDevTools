</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       aireplay-ng - inject packets into a wireless network to generate traffic

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>aireplay-ng</b> [options] &lt;replay interface&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>aireplay-ng</b>  is  used to inject/replay frames.  The primary function is to generate traffic for the later
       use in aircrack-ng for cracking the WEP and WPA-PSK keys. There are different  attacks  which  can  cause
       deauthentications  for  the  purpose  of  capturing WPA handshake data, fake authentications, Interactive
       packet replay, hand-crafted ARP request injection and ARP-request reinjection.  With  the  packetforge-ng
       tool it's possible to create arbitrary frames.

       <b>aireplay-ng</b> supports single-NIC injection/monitor.

       This feature needs driver patching.

       disassociation-frames/

       <b>Attack</b> <b>modes:</b>

       <u>-0</u> <u>&lt;count&gt;,</u> <u>--deauth=&lt;count&gt;</u>
              This  attack  sends deauthentication packets to one or more clients which are currently associated
              with a particular access point. Deauthenticating clients can be done  for  a  number  of  reasons:
              Recovering a hidden ESSID. This is an ESSID which is not being broadcast. Another term for this is
              "cloaked"  or  Capturing  WPA/WPA2 handshakes by forcing clients to reauthenticate or Generate ARP
              requests (Windows clients sometimes flush their ARP cache when  disconnected).   Of  course,  this
              attack is totally useless if there are no associated wireless client or on fake authentications.

       <u>-1</u> <u>&lt;delay&gt;,</u> <u>--fakeauth=&lt;delay&gt;</u>
              The  fake  authentication  attack  allows you to perform the two types of WEP authentication (Open
              System and Shared Key) plus associate with the access point (AP). This is  only  useful  when  you
              need an associated MAC address in various aireplay-ng attacks and there is currently no associated
              client.  It should be noted that the fake authentication attack does NOT generate any ARP packets.
              Fake authentication cannot be used to authenticate/associate with WPA/WPA2 Access Points.

       <u>-2,</u> <u>--interactive</u>
              This attack allows you to choose a specific packet  for  replaying  (injecting).  The  attack  can
              obtain  packets  to  replay  from  two  sources.  The first being a live flow of packets from your
              wireless card. The second being from a pcap file. Reading from  a  file  is  an  often  overlooked
              feature  of  aireplay-ng. This allows you read packets from other capture sessions or quite often,
              various attacks generate pcap files for easy reuse. A common use of reading a  file  containing  a
              packet your created with packetforge-ng.

       <u>-3,</u> <u>--arpreplay</u>
              The  classic  ARP  request  replay attack is the most effective way to generate new initialization
              vectors (IVs), and works very reliably. The program listens for an ARP packet then retransmits  it
              back  to  the access point. This, in turn, causes the access point to repeat the ARP packet with a
              new IV. The program retransmits the same ARP packet  over  and  over.  However,  each  ARP  packet
              repeated  by  the access point has a new IVs. It is all these new IVs which allow you to determine
              the WEP key.

       <u>-4,</u> <u>--chopchop</u>
              This attack, when successful, can decrypt a WEP data packet without knowing the key. It  can  even
              work  against dynamic WEP. This attack does not recover the WEP key itself, but merely reveals the
              plaintext. However, some access points are not vulnerable to this attack. Some may seem vulnerable
              at first but actually drop data packets shorter than 60 bytes. If the access point  drops  packets
              shorter  than  42  bytes,  aireplay-ng  tries to guess the rest of the missing data, as far as the
              headers are predictable. If an IP packet is captured, it additionally checks if  the  checksum  of
              the  header  is  correct after guessing the missing parts of it. This attack requires at least one
              WEP data packet.

       <u>-5,</u> <u>--fragment</u>
              This attack, when successful, can obtain 1500 bytes of PRGA (pseudo random generation  algorithm).
              This attack does not recover the WEP key itself, but merely obtains the PRGA. The PRGA can then be
              used to generate packets with packetforge-ng which are in turn used for various injection attacks.
              It requires at least one data packet to be received from the access point in order to initiate the
              attack.

       <u>-6,</u> <u>--caffe-latte</u>
              In  general,  for  an attack to work, the attacker has to be in the range of an AP and a connected
              client (fake or real). Caffe Latte attacks allows one to gather enough packets to crack a WEP  key
              without the need of an AP, it just need a client to be in range.

       <u>-7,</u> <u>--cfrag</u>
              This attack turns IP or ARP packets from a client into ARP request against the client. This attack
              works  especially  well against ad-hoc networks. As well it can be used against softAP clients and
              normal AP clients.

       <u>-8,</u> <u>--migmode</u>
              This attack works against Cisco Aironet access points configured  in  WPA  Migration  Mode,  which
              enables  both  WPA  and  WEP  clients  to  associate to an access point using the same Service Set
              Identifier (SSID).  The program listens for a WEP-encapsulated broadcast ARP packet,  bitflips  it
              to  make  it  into  an ARP coming from the attacker's MAC address and retransmits it to the access
              point. This, in turn, causes the access point to repeat the ARP packet with a new IV and  also  to
              forward  the  ARP reply to the attacker with a new IV. The program retransmits the same ARP packet
              over and over. However, each ARP packet repeated by the access point has a new IV as does the  ARP
              reply  forwarded  to  the attacker by the access point. It is all these new IVs which allow you to
              determine the WEP key.

       <u>-9,</u> <u>--test</u>
              Tests injection and quality.

</pre><h4><b>FRAGMENTATION</b> <b>VERSUS</b> <b>CHOPCHOP</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Fragmentation:</b>

              <u>Pros</u>
              - Can obtain the full packet length of 1500 bytes XOR. This means you can subsequently pretty well
              create any size of packet.
              - May work where chopchop does not
              - Is extremely fast. It yields the XOR stream extremely quickly when successful.

              <u>Cons</u>
              - Setup to execute the attack is more subject to the device drivers. For example, Atheros does not
              generate the correct packets unless the wireless card is set to the mac address you are spoofing.
              - You need to be physically closer to the access point since if any  packets  are  lost  then  the
              attack fails.

       <b>Chopchop</b>

              <u>Pro</u>
              - May work where frag does not work.

              <u>Cons</u>
              - Cannot be used against every access point.
              - The maximum XOR bits is limited to the length of the packet you chopchop against.
              - Much slower then the fragmentation attack.
