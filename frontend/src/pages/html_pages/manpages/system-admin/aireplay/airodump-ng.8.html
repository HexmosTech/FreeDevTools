</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       airodump-ng - a wireless packet capture tool for aircrack-ng

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>airodump-ng</b> [options] &lt;interface name&gt;[,&lt;interface name&gt;,...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>airodump-ng</b> is used for packet capturing of raw 802.11 frames for the intent of using them with aircrack-
       ng.  If  you  have  a  GPS  receiver  connected  to  the  computer, airodump-ng is capable of logging the
       coordinates of the found access points. Additionally, airodump-ng writes out a text file  containing  the
       details of all access points and clients seen.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-H,</u> <u>--help</u>
              Shows the help screen.

       <u>-i,</u> <u>--ivs</u>
              It only saves IVs (only useful for cracking). If this option is specified, you have to give a dump
              prefix (--write option)

       <u>-g,</u> <u>--gpsd</u>
              Indicate that airodump-ng should try to use GPSd to get coordinates.

       <u>-w</u> <u>&lt;prefix&gt;,</u> <u>--write</u> <u>&lt;prefix&gt;</u>
              Is the dump file prefix to use. If this option is not given, it will only show data on the screen.
              Beside this file a CSV file with the same filename as the capture will be created.

       <u>-e,</u> <u>--beacons</u>
              It  will  record  all  beacons  into  the cap file. By default it only records one beacon for each
              network.

       <u>-u</u> <u>&lt;secs&gt;,</u> <u>--update</u> <u>&lt;secs&gt;</u>
              Delay &lt;secs&gt; seconds delay between display updates (default: 1 second). Useful for slow CPU.

       <u>-A,</u> <u>--showack</u>
              Prints ACK/CTS/RTS statistics. Helps in  debugging  and  general  injection  optimization.  It  is
              indication  if  you  inject, inject too fast, reach the AP, the frames are valid encrypted frames.
              Allows one to detect "hidden" stations, which are too far away to capture high bitrate frames,  as
              ACK frames are sent at 1Mbps.

       <u>-h</u>     Hides known stations for --showack.

       <u>-f</u> <u>&lt;msecs&gt;</u>
              Time in milliseconds between hopping channels.

       <u>-B</u> <u>&lt;secs&gt;,</u> <u>--berlin</u> <u>&lt;secs&gt;</u>
              Time  before removing the AP/client from the screen when no more frames are received (Default: 120
              seconds). See airodump-ng source for the history behind this option ;).

       <u>-c</u> <u>&lt;channel&gt;[,&lt;channel&gt;[,...]],</u> <u>--channel</u> <u>&lt;channel&gt;[,&lt;channel&gt;[,...]]</u>
              Indicate the channel(s) to listen to. By default airodump-ng hops on all 2.4GHz channels.

       <u>-O,</u> <u>--ignore-other-chans</u>
              Ignore access points on channels other than the selected one(s). Requires --channel (or -c).

       <u>-C</u> <u>&lt;freq&gt;[,&lt;freq&gt;[,...]]</u>
              Indicates the frequencies to listen to. By default airodump-ng hops on all 2.4GHz channels.

       <u>-b</u> <u>&lt;abg&gt;,</u> <u>--band</u> <u>&lt;abg&gt;</u>
              Indicate the band on which airodump-ng should hop. It can be a combination of  'a',  'b'  and  'g'
              letters ('b' and 'g' uses 2.4GHz and 'a' uses 5GHz). Incompatible with --channel option.

       <u>-s</u> <u>&lt;method&gt;,</u> <u>--cswitch</u> <u>&lt;method&gt;</u>
              Defines  the  way  airodump-ng  sets  the  channels when using more than one card. Valid values: 0
              (FIFO, default value), 1 (Round Robin) or 2 (Hop on last).

       <u>-2,</u> <u>--ht20</u>
              Set the channel to be in HT20 (802.11n).

       <u>-3,</u> <u>--ht40+</u>
              Set the channel to be in HT40+ (802.11n). It requires the frequency 20MHz above to be available (4
              channels above) and thus some channels are not  usable  in  HT40+.  Only  channels  up  to  7  are
              available in HT40+ in the US (and 9 in most of Europe).

       <u>-5,</u> <u>--ht40-</u>
              Set the channel to be in HT40- (802.11n). It requires the frequency 20MHz below to be available (4
              channels be)low and thus some channels are not usable in HT40-. In 2.4GHz, HT40- channels start at
              channel 5.

       <u>-r</u> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              Reads packet from a file.

       <u>-T,</u> <u>--real-time</u>
              While reading frames from a file specified with '-r &lt;file&gt;', simulate the arrival rate of them, as
              if they were "live".

       <u>-x</u> <u>&lt;msecs&gt;</u>
              Active Scanning Simulation (send probe requests and parse the probe responses).

       <u>-M,</u> <u>--manufacturer</u>
              Display  a manufacturer column with the information obtained from the IEEE OUI list. See <a href="../man8/airodumpng-oui-update.8.html">airodump-</a>
              <a href="../man8/airodumpng-oui-update.8.html">ng-oui-update</a>(8)

       <u>-U,</u> <u>--uptime</u>
              Display APs uptime obtained from its beacon timestamp.

       <u>-W,</u> <u>--wps</u>
              Display a WPS column with WPS version, config method(s), AP Setup Locked obtained from APs  beacon
              or probe response (if any).

       <u>-o</u> <u>&lt;formats&gt;,</u> <u>--output-format</u> <u>&lt;formats&gt;</u>
              Define  the  formats  to  use  (separated  by  a comma). Possible values are: pcap, ivs, csv, gps,
              kismet, netxml. The default  values  are:  pcap,  csv,  kismet,  kismet-newcore.   'pcap'  is  for
              recording  a  capture  in pcap format, 'ivs' is for ivs format (it is a shortcut for --ivs). 'csv'
              will create an airodump-ng CSV file, 'kismet' will create a kismet csv file  and  'kismet-newcore'
              will create the kismet netxml file. 'gps' is a shortcut for --gps.
              These values can be combined with the exception of ivs and pcap.

       <u>-I</u> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;,</u> <u>--write-interval</u> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              Output  file(s)  write  interval  for  CSV,  Kismet  CSV  and Kismet NetXML in seconds (minimum: 1
              second). By default: 5 seconds. Note that an interval too small might slow down airodump-ng.

       <u>-K</u> <u>&lt;enable&gt;,</u> <u>--background</u> <u>&lt;enable&gt;</u>
              Override automatic background detection. Use "0" to force foreground settings  and  "1"  to  force
              background  settings.  It  will  not  make  airodump-ng  run  as a daemon, it will skip background
              autodetection and force enable/disable of interactive mode and display updates.

       <u>--ignore-negative-one</u>
              Removes the message that says 'fixed channel &lt;interface&gt;: -1'.

       -----------------------------------------------------------------------

       <u>BSSID</u>  MAC  address  of the access point. In the Client section, a BSSID of "(not associated)" means that
              the client is not associated with any AP. In this unassociated state, it is searching for an AP to
              connect with.

       <u>PWR</u>    Signal level reported by the Wi-Fi adapter. Its signification depends on the driver,  but  as  you
              get  closer  to  the  AP  or  the  station,  the  signal  gets  higher.  It  usually  is  the RSSI
              (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_signal_strength_indication). If the BSSID PWR is -1,  then
              the  driver  doesn't support signal level reporting. If PWR is -1 for some access points, it means
              the access point is out of range, however airodump-ng got at least a frame sent to it. If the  PWR
              is  -1  for  a  limited number of stations then this is for a packet which came from the AP to the
              client but the client transmissions are out of range for  your  Wi-Fi  adapter.  Meaning  you  are
              hearing  only  1/2  of the communication. If all clients have PWR as -1 then it is likely that the
              driver doesn't support signal level reporting. A strong signal is around -40. An  average  one  is
              around -55, and a weak one starts around -70. Wi-Fi adapters lower limit (aka receive sensitivity)
              is often around -80/-90.

       <u>RXQ</u>    Only  shown  when  on  a  fixed  channel.  Receive Quality as measured by the percentage of frames
              (management and data frames) successfully received over the last 10 seconds.  It's  measured  over
              all  management  and data frames. That's the clue, this allows you to read more things out of this
              value. Lets say you got 100 percent RXQ and all 10 (or  whatever  the  rate)  beacons  per  second
              coming  in.  Now  all  of a sudden the RXQ drops below 90, but you still capture all sent beacons.
              Thus you know that the AP is sending frames to a client but you can't hear the client nor  the  AP
              sending  to  the  client (need to get closer). Another thing would be, that you got a 11MB card to
              monitor and capture frames (say a prism2.5) and you have a very good position to the AP. The AP is
              set to 54MBit and then again the RXQ drops, so you know that there is at least one  54MBit  client
              connected to the AP.

       <u>Beacons</u>
              Number  of  beacons  sent  by  the AP. Each access point sends about ten beacons per second at the
              lowest rate (1M), so they can usually be picked up from very far.

       <u>#Data</u>  Number of captured data packets (if WEP, unique IV count), including data broadcast packets.

       <u>#/s</u>    Number of data packets per second measure over the last 10 seconds.

       <u>CH</u>     Channel number (taken from beacon frames). Note: sometimes frames from other channels are captured
              even if airodump-ng is not hopping, because of radio interference.

       <u>MB</u>     Maximum speed supported by the AP. If MB = 11, it's 802.11b, if MB = 22 it's 802.11b+  and  higher
              rates  are  802.11g. The dot (after 54 above) indicates short preamble is supported. 'e' indicates
              that the network has QoS (802.11e) enabled.

       <u>ENC</u>    Encryption algorithm in use. OPN = no encryption,"WEP?" = WEP or higher (not enough data to choose
              between WEP and WPA/WPA2), WEP (without the question mark) indicates static or  dynamic  WEP,  and
              WPA or WPA2 if TKIP or CCMP or MGT is present.

       <u>CIPHER</u> The  cipher  detected.  One of CCMP, WRAP, TKIP, WEP, WEP40, or WEP104. Not mandatory, but TKIP is
              typically used with WPA and CCMP is typically used with WPA2. WEP40  is  displayed  when  the  key
              index  is  greater than 0. The standard states that the index can be 0-3 for 40bit and should be 0
              for 104 bit.

       <u>AUTH</u>   The authentication protocol used. One of MGT (WPA/WPA2 using a  separate  authentication  server),
              SKA (shared key for WEP), PSK (pre-shared key for WPA/WPA2), or OPN (open for WEP).

       <u>WPS</u>    This is only displayed when --wps (or -W) is specified. If the AP supports WPS, the first field of
              the column indicates version supported. The second field indicates WPS config methods (can be more
              than  one  method,  separated  by  comma): USB = USB method, ETHER = Ethernet, LAB = Label, DISP =
              Display, EXTNFC = External NFC, INTNFC = Internal NFC, NFCINTF = NFC Interface, PBC = Push Button,
              KPAD =  Keypad. Locked is displayed when AP setup is locked.

       <u>ESSID</u>  The so-called "SSID", which can be empty if SSID hiding is activated. In  this  case,  airodump-ng
              will try to recover the SSID from probe responses and association requests.

       <u>STATION</u>
              MAC  address  of  each associated station or stations searching for an AP to connect with. Clients
              not currently associated with an AP have a BSSID of "(not associated)".

       <u>Rate</u>   This is only displayed when using a single channel. The first number is the last  data  rate  from
              the  AP  (BSSID)  to  the  Client  (STATION).  The second number is the last data rate from Client
              (STATION) to the AP (BSSID).

       <u>Lost</u>   It means lost frames coming from the client. To determine the number of frames lost,  there  is  a
              sequence  field  on  every  non-control frame, so you can subtract the second last sequence number
              from the last sequence number and you know how many frames you have lost.

       <u>Notes</u>  Additional information about the client, such as captured EAPOL or PMKID.

       <u>Frames</u> The number of data packets sent by the client.

       <u>Probes</u> The ESSIDs probed by the client. These are the networks the client is trying to connect to  if  it
              is not currently connected.

       The  first  part  is  the detected access points. The second part is a list of detected wireless clients,
       stations. By relying on the signal power, one can even  physically  pinpoint  the  location  of  a  given
       station.
