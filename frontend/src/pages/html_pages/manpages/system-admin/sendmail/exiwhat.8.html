</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       exiwhat - Finding out what Exim processes are doing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>exiwhat</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       On  operating  systems  that can restart a system call after receiving a signal (most modern OS), an <b>Exim</b>
       process responds to the SIGUSR1 signal by writing a  line  describing  what  it  is  doing  to  the  file
       exim-process.info in the Exim spool directory.  The <b>exiwhat</b> script sends the signal to all <b>Exim</b> processes
       it  can find, having first emptied the file.  It then waits for one second to allow the <b>Exim</b> processes to
       react before displaying the results.  In order to run <b>exiwhat</b> successfully you have  to  have  sufficient
       privilege to send the signal to the <b>Exim</b> processes, so it is normally run as root.

       Unfortunately,  the  <b>ps</b>  command  which <b>exiwhat</b> uses to find <b>Exim</b> processes varies in different operating
       systems.  Not only are different options used, but the format of  the  output  is  different.   For  this
       reason,  there  are  some  system  configuration options that configure exactly how <b>exiwhat</b> works.  If it
       doesn't seem to be working for you, check the following compile-time options:

       <u>EXIWHAT_PS_CMD</u>
              the command for running “ps”

       <u>EXIWHAT_PS_ARG</u>
              the argument for “ps”

       <u>EXIWHAT_EGREP_ARG</u>
              the argument for “egrep” to select from “ps” output

       <u>EXIWHAT_KILL_ARG</u>
              the argument for the “kill” command

       An example of typical output from <b>exiwhat</b> is

         164 daemon: -q1h, listening on port 25
       10483 running queue: waiting for 0tAycK-0002ij-00 (10492)
       10492 delivering 0tAycK-0002ij-00 to mail.ref.example [10.19.42.42]
         (<a href="mailto:editor@ref.example">editor@ref.example</a>)
       10592 handling incoming call from [192.168.243.242]
       10628 accepting a local non-SMTP message

       The first number in the output line is the process number.  The third line has been split here, in  order
       to fit it on the page.

       This  manual  page needs a major re-work.  If somebody knows better groff than us and has more experience
       in writing manual pages, any patches would be greatly appreciated.
