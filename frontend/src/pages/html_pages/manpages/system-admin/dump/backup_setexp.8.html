       backup_setexp - Sets the expiration date for existing dump levels.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>backup</b> <b>setexp</b> <b>-dump</b> &lt;<u>dump</u> <u>level</u> <u>name</u>&gt;+
           [<b>-expires</b> &lt;<u>expiration</u> <u>date</u>&gt;+] [<b>-localauth</b>]
           [<b>-cell</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;] [<b>-help</b>]

       <b>backup</b> <b>se</b> <b>-d</b> &lt;<u>dump</u> <u>level</u> <u>name</u>&gt;+
           [<b>-e</b> &lt;<u>expiration</u> <u>date</u>&gt;+]
           [<b>-l</b>] [<b>-c</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;] [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>backup</b> <b>setexp</b> command sets or changes the expiration date associated with each specified dump level,
       which must already exist in the dump hierarchy.

       Use the <b>-expires</b> argument to associate an expiration date with each dump level. When the Backup System
       subsequently creates a dump at the dump level, it uses the specified value to derive the dump's
       expiration date, which it records on the label of the tape (or backup data file). The Backup System
       refuses to overwrite a tape until after the latest expiration date of any dump that the tape contains,
       unless the <b>backup</b> <b>labeltape</b> command is used to relabel the tape. If a dump level does not have an
       expiration date, the Backup System treats dumps created at the level as expired as soon as it creates
       them.

       (Note that the Backup System does not automatically remove a dump's record from the Backup Database when
       the dump reaches its expiration date, but only if the tape that contains the dump is recycled or
       relabeled. To remove expired and other obsolete dump records, use the <b>backup</b> <b>deletedump</b> command.)

       Define either an absolute or relative expiration date:

       •   An absolute expiration date defines the month/day/year (and, optionally, hour and minutes) at which a
           dump  expires.  If the expiration date predates the dump creation time, the Backup System immediately
           treats the dump as expired.

       •   A relative date defines the number of years, months, or days (or a combination of  the  three)  after
           the  dump's  creation  that  it  expires. When the Backup System creates a dump at the dump level, it
           calculates an actual expiration date by adding the relative date  to  the  start  time  of  the  dump
           operation.

       If  the  command is used to change an existing expiration date associated with a dump level, the new date
       applies only to dumps created after the change. Existing dumps retain the expiration date assigned at the
       time they were created.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-dump</b> &lt;<u>dump</u> <u>level</u> <u>name</u>&gt;+
           Specifies the full pathname of each dump level  to  assign  the  expiration  date  specified  by  the
           <b>-expires</b> argument.

       <b>-expires</b> &lt;<u>expiration</u> <u>date</u>&gt;+
           Defines the absolute or relative expiration date to associate with each dump level named by the <b>-dump</b>
           argument. Absolute expiration dates have the following format:

              [at] {NEVER | &lt;mm&gt;/&lt;dd&gt;/&lt;yyyy&gt; [&lt;hh&gt;:&lt;MM&gt;] }

           where  the  optional  word  at  is  followed either by the string "NEVER", which indicates that dumps
           created at the dump level never expire, or by a date value with a required portion (&lt;mm&gt;  for  month,
           &lt;dd&gt; for day, and &lt;yyyy&gt; for year) and an optional portion (&lt;hh&gt; for hours and &lt;MM&gt; for minutes).

           Omit  the  &lt;hh&gt;:&lt;MM&gt;  portion  to  use  the  default of midnight (00:00 hours), or provide a value in
           24-hour format (for example, "20:30" is 8:30 p.m.).  Valid values for the year  range  from  1970  to
           2037;  higher  values  are  not  valid  because  the  latest  possible  date  in  the  standard  UNIX
           representation is in February 2038. The command interpreter automatically reduces later dates to  the
           maximum value.

           Relative expiration dates have the following format:

              [in] [&lt;years&gt;y] [&lt;months&gt;m] [&lt;days&gt;d]

           where  the  optional word in is followed by at least one of a number of years (maximum 9999) followed
           by the letter "y", a number of months (maximum 12) followed by the letter "m", or a  number  of  days
           (maximum  31)  followed  by the letter "d". If providing more than one of the three, list them in the
           indicated order. If the date that results from adding the  relative  expiration  value  to  a  dump's
           creation  time  is  later  than  the latest possible date in the UNIX time representation, the Backup
           System automatically reduces it to that date.

       <b>-localauth</b>
           Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local <u>/etc/openafs/server/KeyFile</u>  file.  The  <b>backup</b>
           command  interpreter  presents  it  to  the  Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server during mutual
           authentication. Do not combine this flag with the <b>-cell</b> argument. For more details, see <b><a href="../man8/backup.8.html">backup</a></b>(8).

       <b>-cell</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument with  the  <b>-localauth</b>  flag.
           For more details, see <b><a href="../man8/backup.8.html">backup</a></b>(8).

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  example associates an absolute expiration date of 10:00 p.m. on 31 December 1999 with the
       dump level "/1998/december":

          % backup setexp -dump /1998/december -expires at 12/31/1999 22:00

       The following example associates a  relative  expiration  date  of  7  days  with  the  two  dump  levels
       "/monthly/week1" and "/monthly/week2":

          % backup setexp -dump /monthly/week1 /monthly/week -expires 7d

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>REQUIRED</b></h4><pre>
       The  issuer  must  be  listed  in the <u>/etc/openafs/server/UserList</u> file on every machine where the Backup
       Server is running, or must be logged onto  a  server  machine  as  the  local  superuser  "root"  if  the
       <b>-localauth</b> flag is included.
