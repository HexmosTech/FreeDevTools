</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>backup</b> <b>dump</b> command either dumps the volume set specified by the <b>-volumeset</b> argument at the dump
       level specified by the <b>-dump</b> argument and creates a Backup Database dump record about it, or executes the
       dump instructions listed in the file named by the <b>-file</b> argument. The Tape Coordinator indicated by the
       <b>-portoffset</b> argument (or on each command in the file) executes the operation.

       (If the "FILE YES" instruction appears in the <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup/CFG_device_name</u> file on the Tape
       Coordinator machine associated with the specified port offset, then the Backup System dumps data to the
       backup data file listed for that port offset in the Tape Coordinator's <u>/var/lib/openafs/backup/tapeconfig</u>
       file, rather than to tape. For the sake of clarity, the following text refers to tapes only, but the
       Backup System handles backup data files in much the same way.)

       The term <u>dumping</u> refers to copying a collection of data to tape or a backup data file, and the resulting
       collection is termed a <u>dump</u>. The set of tapes that contain one or more dumps is called a <u>dump</u> <u>set</u>. The
       first dump in a dump set is its <u>initial</u> <u>dump</u>, and any dumps subsequently added to the dump set (by use of
       the <b>-append</b> argument) are <u>appended</u> <u>dumps</u>.  Creating appended dumps is optional, and appended dumps can be
       of different volume sets, and at different dump levels, than the initial dump.

       A <u>full</u> <u>dump</u>, created at a full dump level in the dump hierarchy, contains all of the data that existed at
       the time of the dump in the volumes belonging to the volume set. An <u>incremental</u> <u>dump</u>, created at an
       incremental dump level, contains only data that has changed since the volume set was dumped at the
       incremental level's <u>parent</u> <u>dump</u> <u>level</u> (the dump level immediately above the incremental level in the
       hierarchy), which can be a full or incremental level. More specifically, an incremental dump includes
       only the files and directories that have modification timestamps later than the <u>clone</u> <u>date</u> of the volume
       included at the parent dump level. For backup and read-only volumes, the clone date is the time at which
       the volume was cloned from its read/write source before being included in the parent dump; for read/write
       volumes, it represents the time at which the volume was locked for inclusion in the parent dump. The
       clone date appears in the <u>clone</u> <u>date</u> field of the output from the <b>backup</b> <b>volinfo</b> command. As an example,
       an incremental dump at the "/full/week1/thursday" level includes only files and directories that have
       changed since the volume set was dumped at the "/full/week1" level.

   <b>Initiating</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>dump</b> <b>operations</b>
       To initiate a dump operation that is to start as soon as the relevant Tape Coordinator is available,
       provide only the <b>-volumeset</b>, <b>-dump</b>, <b>-portoffset</b>, and optionally <b>-append</b> options. To schedule a single
       <b>backup</b> <b>dump</b> command to execute in the future, also include the <b>-at</b> argument to specify the start time.

       To append a dump to an existing dump set, include the <b>-append</b> flag. The Backup System imposes the
       following conditions on appended dumps:

       •   If  writing  to  tape,  the  Tape Coordinator checks that it is the final one in a dump set for which
           there are complete and valid tape and dump records in the Backup Database. If  not,  it  rejects  the
           tape  and requests an acceptable one. The operator can use the <b>-dbadd</b> argument to the <b>backup</b> <b>scantape</b>
           command to insert the necessary records into the database.

       •   The most recent dump on the tape or in the backup data file must have completed successfully.

       •   The dump set must begin with an initial dump that is recorded in the Backup Database. If there are no
           dumps on the tape, then the Backup System treats the dump operation as an initial  dump  and  imposes
           the relevant requirements (for example, checks the AFS tape name if appropriate).

       To  schedule  multiple  dump  operations,  list  the  operations in the file named by the <b>-file</b> argument.
       Optionally include the <b>-at</b> argument to specify when  the  <b>backup</b>  command  interpreter  reads  the  file;
       otherwise  it  reads  it  immediately.  Do  not combine the <b>-file</b> argument with the command's first three
       arguments or the <b>-append</b> or <b>-dryrun</b> flags. The commands in the file can include any of  the  <b>backup</b>  <b>dump</b>
       command's arguments, including the <b>-at</b> argument to schedule them to run even later in the future.

       To  generate a list of the volumes included in a dump, without actually dumping them, combine the <b>-dryrun</b>
       flag with the options to be used on the actual command.

   <b>How</b> <b>the</b> <b>Backup</b> <b>System</b> <b>executes</b> <b>a</b> <b>dump</b> <b>operation</b>
       Before beginning a dump operation, the Backup System verifies that there is a Backup Database  entry  for
       the volume set, dump level, and port offset. If the command is correctly formed and issued in interactive
       mode,  it is assigned a job number and added to the jobs list. List jobs in interactive mode by using the
       <b>backup</b> <b>jobs</b> command; terminate them with the <b>backup</b> <b>kill</b> command.

       After obtaining the list of volumes to dump from the Volume Location (VL) Server, the Backup System sorts
       the list by site (server and partition). It groups volumes from the same site together  in  the  dump  to
       minimize the number of times the operator must change tapes during restore operations.

       The dependence of an incremental dump on its parent means that a valid parent dump must already exist for
       the  Backup System to create its child incremental dump. If the Backup System does not find a record of a
       dump created at the immediate parent dump level, it looks in the Backup Database for a  dump  created  at
       one  level  higher  in  the  hierarchy,  and so on, up to the full dump level if necessary. It creates an
       incremental dump at the level one below the lowest valid parent dump set that it finds. If  it  fails  to
       find even a full dump, it dumps the volume set at the full dump level.

       If  the Backup System is unable to access a volume during a dump operation, it skips the volume and dumps
       the remaining volumes from the volume set. Possible reasons  a  volume  is  inaccessible  include  server
       machine or process outages, or that the volume was moved between the time the Volume Location (VL) Server
       generated  the  list  of  sites  for the volume in the volume set and the time the Backup System actually
       attempts to dump the data in it. After the first dumping pass, the Backup System attempts  to  dump  each
       volume  it  skipped. If it still cannot dump a volume and the "ASK NO" instruction does not appear in the
       <u>CFG_device_name</u> file, it queries the operator as to whether it needs to attempt to dump the volume again,
       omit the volume from the dump, or halt the dump operation altogether. When  prompted,  the  operator  can
       attempt to solve whatever problem prevented the Backup System from accessing the volumes. If the "ASK NO"
       instruction appears in the <u>CFG_device_name</u> file, the Backup System omits the volume from the dump.

       Before  scheduling  a  dump  operation,  the  Backup  System  verifies that the date specified by the <b>-at</b>
       argument is in the future, and checks the validity of the volume set, dump level and port offset as for a
       regular dump operation. It checks the validity of the parameters again just before actually  running  the
       scheduled operation.

       Before  writing  an  initial  dump to a tape that does not have a permanent name on the label, the Backup
       System checks that the AFS tape name on the label is acceptable. If desired,  disable  name  checking  by
       including the "NAME_CHECK NO" instruction in the <u>CFG_device_name</u> file.

       If  AFS  tape name checking is enabled, the Backup System accepts the following three types of values for
       the AFS tape name. If the name on the label does not conform, the Backup System obtains a  tape  with  an
       acceptable  label  by  invoking  the  "MOUNT"  instruction  in  the <u>CFG_device_name</u> file or prompting the
       operator.

       •   A name of the form  <u>volume_set_name.dump_level_name.tape_index</u>,  where  <u>volume_set_name</u>  matches  the
           value  of  the <b>-volumeset</b> argument, <u>dump_level_name</u> matches the last element in the pathname value of
           the <b>-dump</b> argument, and <u>tape_index</u> reflects the tape's place in a multitape dump set. As an  example,
           the  first  tape  in  a dump set for which the initial dump is of volume set "user" at the dump level
           "/sunday2/monday" has AFS tape name "user.monday.1". If the label records this type of AFS tape name,
           the Backup System retains the AFS tape name and writes the dump to the tape.

       •   The string "&lt;NULL&gt;", which usually indicates that a backup operator has  used  the  <b>backup</b>  <b>labeltape</b>
           command  to  write  a label on the tape, but did not include the <b>-name</b> argument to assign an AFS tape
           name. Presumably, the operator did include the <b>-pname</b> argument to assign a  permanent  name.  If  the
           label records a "&lt;NULL&gt;" value, the Backup System constructs and records on the label the appropriate
           AFS tape name, and writes the dump on the tape.

       •   No  value  at  all, because the tape has never been labeled or used in the Backup System. As when the
           AFS tape name is "&lt;NULL&gt;", the Backup System constructs and records on the label the appropriate  AFS
           tape name, and writes the dump on the tape.

       To  determine  how  much data it can write to a tape, the Tape Coordinator reads the capacity recorded on
       the tape's label (placed there by including the <b>-size</b> argument to the <b>backup</b> <b>labeltape</b> command).  If  the
       label's  capacity  field is empty, the Tape Coordinator uses the capacity recorded for the specified port
       offset in the local <u>tapeconfig</u> file. If the capacity field in the <u>tapeconfig</u> file is also empty, the Tape
       Coordinator uses the maximum capacity of 2 TB.

       During a dump operation, the Tape Coordinator tracks how much data  it  has  written  and  stops  shortly
       before it reaches what it believes is the tape's capacity. If it is in the middle of writing the data for
       a  volume when it reaches that point, it writes a special marker that indicates an interrupted volume and
       continues writing the volume on the next tape. It can split a volume this way during both an initial  and
       an appended dump, and the fact that the volume resides on multiple tapes is automatically recorded in the
       Backup Database.

       If  the tape is actually larger than the expected capacity, then the Tape Coordinator simply does not use
       the excess tape. If the tape is smaller than the expected capacity, the Tape Coordinator  can  reach  the
       end-of-tape  (EOT) unexpectedly while it is writing data. If the Tape Coordinator is in the middle of the
       writing data from a volume, it obtains a new tape and rewrites the entire  contents  of  the  interrupted
       volume  to it. The data from the volume that was written to the previous tape remains there, but is never
       used.

       The Backup System allows recycling of tapes (writing a new dump set over an  old  dump  set  that  is  no
       longer needed), but imposes the following conditions:

       •   All dumps in the old dump set must be expired. The Backup System always checks expiration dates, even
           when name checking is disabled.

       •   If  the tape to be recycled does not have a permanent name and name checking is enabled, then the AFS
           tape name derived from the new initial dump's volume set name and dump level name must match the  AFS
           tape name already recorded on the label.

       •   The  tape  cannot already have data on it that belongs to the dump currently being performed, because
           that implies that the operator or automated tape device has not removed the previous  tape  from  the
           drive,  or  has  mistakenly  reinserted  it. The Tape Coordinator generates the following message and
           attempts to obtain another tape:

              Can't overwrite tape containing the dump in progress

       •   The tape cannot contain  data  from  a  parent  dump  of  the  current  (incremental)  dump,  because
           overwriting  a  parent  dump  makes  it  impossible  to  restore data from the current dump. The Tape
           Coordinator generates the following message and attempts to obtain another tape:

              Can't overwrite the parent dump I&lt;parent_name&gt; (I&lt;parent_dump_ID&gt;)

       To recycle a tape before all dumps on it have expired or if the AFS tape name is wrong,  use  the  <b>backup</b>
       <b>labeltape</b>  command to overwrite the tape's label and remove all associated tape and dump records from the
       Backup Database.

       The Tape Coordinator's default response to this command is to access  the  first  tape  by  invoking  the
       "MOUNT"  instruction  in the <u>CFG_device_name</u> file, or by prompting the backup operator to insert the tape
       if there is no  "MOUNT"  instruction.   However,  if  the  "AUTOQUERY  NO"  instruction  appears  in  the
       <u>CFG_device_name</u>  file,  or  if  the  issuer  of the <b>butc</b> command included the <b>-noautoquery</b> flag, the Tape
       Coordinator instead expects the tape to be in the device already. If it  is  not,  the  Tape  Coordinator
       invokes  the  "MOUNT"  instruction  or  prompts  the operator. It also invokes the "MOUNT" instruction or
       prompts for any additional tapes needed to complete the  dump  operation;  the  issuer  must  arrange  to
       provide them.

</pre><h4><b>CAUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If  a dump operation is interrupted or fails for any reason, data from all volumes written to tape before
       the interrupt are valid can be used in a restore operation. The Backup Database includes an entry for the
       failed dump and for each volume that was successfully dumped. See the <u>OpenAFS</u>  <u>Administration</u>  <u>Guide</u>  for
       information on dealing with interrupted dumps.

       If  dumping  to tape rather than a backup data file, it is best to use only compatible tape devices (ones
       that can read the same type of tape).  Using compatible devices greatly  simplifies  restore  operations.
       The  <b>-portoffset</b>  argument  to  the <b>backup</b> <b>diskrestore</b> and <b>backup</b> <b>volsetrestore</b> commands accepts multiple
       port offset numbers, but the Backup System uses the first listed port  offset  when  restoring  all  full
       dumps,  the  second  port  offset  when  restoring  all  level 1 dumps, and so on. At the very least, use
       compatible tape devices to perform dumps at each level. If compatible tape  devices  are  not  used,  the
       <b>backup</b> <b>volrestore</b> command must be used to restore one volume at a time.

       Valid  (unexpired) administrative tokens must be available to the <b>backup</b> command interpreter both when it
       reads the file named by the <b>-file</b>  argument  and  when  it  runs  each  operation  listed  in  the  file.
       Presumably,  the  issuer  is  scheduling  dumps  for times when no human operator is present, and so must
       arrange for valid tokens to be available on the local machine. One option is to issue  all  commands  (or
       run  all  scripts) on file server machines and use the <b>-localauth</b> flag on the <b>backup</b> and <b>vos</b> commands. To
       protect against improper access to the machine or the tokens,  the  machine  must  be  physically  secure
       (perhaps  even  more  protected  than  a  Tape  Coordinator  machine monitored by a human operator during
       operation). Also, if an unattended dump requires multiple tapes, the operator must properly  configure  a
       tape stacker or jukebox and the device configuration file.

       When  the  command  is issued in regular (non-interactive) mode, the command shell prompt does not return
       until the dump operation completes. To avoid having to open additional connections, issue the command  in
       interactive mode, especially when including the <b>-at</b> argument to schedule dump operations.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-volumeset</b> &lt;<u>volume</u> <u>set</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           Names the volume set to dump. The <b>-dump</b> argument must be provided along with this one; do not combine
           them  with  the  <b>-file</b> argument. If using a temporary volume set, the <b>vos</b> <b>dump</b> command must be issued
           within the interactive session in which the <b>backup</b> <b>addvolset</b> command was issued with  the  <b>-temporary</b>
           flag.

       <b>-dump</b> &lt;<u>dump</u> <u>level</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           Specifies  the  complete  pathname  of the dump level at which to dump the volume set. The <b>-volumeset</b>
           argument must be provided along with this one; do not combine them with the <b>-file</b> argument.

       <b>-portoffset</b> &lt;<u>TC</u> <u>port</u> <u>offset</u>&gt;
           Specifies the port offset number of the Tape Coordinator handling the tapes for  this  operation.  It
           must  be  provided  unless  the  default value of 0 (zero) is appropriate; do not combine it with the
           <b>-file</b> argument.

       <b>-at</b> &lt;<u>date/time</u> <u>to</u> <u>start</u> <u>dump</u>&gt;
           Specifies the date and time in the future at which to run the command, or to read the file  named  by
           the <b>-file</b> argument. Provide a value in the format <u>mm/dd/yyyy</u> [<u>hh:MM</u>], where the month (<u>mm</u>), day (<u>dd</u>),
           and  year  (<u>yyyy</u>)  are required. Valid values for the year range from 1970 to 2037; higher values are
           not valid because the latest possible date in the standard UNIX representation is in  February  2038.
           The Backup System automatically reduces any later date to the maximum value.

           The  hour  and  minutes (<u>hh:MM</u>) are optional, but if provided must be in 24-hour format (for example,
           the value "14:36" represents 2:36 p.m.). If omitted, the time defaults to midnight (00:00 hours).

           As an example, the value 04/23/1999 20:20 schedules the command for 8:20 p.m. on 23 April 1999.

       <b>-append</b>
           Appends the dump onto the end of a tape that already contains data from another dump. However, if the
           tape is not in fact part of an existing dump set, the Backup System creates a new dump set using  the
           parameters  of  this  dump.  If  the  tape is not the last tape in the dump set, the Tape Coordinator
           prompts for insertion of the appropriate tape. Do not combine this argument with the <b>-file</b> argument.

       <b>-dryrun</b> | <b>-n</b>
           Displays the names of volumes to be included in the indicated dump, without actually  performing  the
           dump operation. Do not combine this argument with the <b>-file</b> argument.

       <b>-file</b> &lt;<u>load</u> <u>file</u>&gt;
           Specifies  the  local  disk  or  AFS pathname of a file containing <b>backup</b> commands. The Backup System
           reads the file immediately, or at the time specified by the <b>-at</b> argument if it is provided. A partial
           pathname is interpreted relative to the current working directory.

           Place each <b>backup</b> <b>dump</b> command on its own line in the indicated file, using the same  syntax  as  for
           the  command  line, but without the word <b>backup</b> at the start of the line. Each command must include a
           value for the <b>-volumeset</b> and <b>-dump</b> arguments, and for the <b>-portoffset</b>  argument  unless  the  default
           value  of  0  is  appropriate. Commands in the file can also include any of the <b>backup</b> <b>dump</b> command's
           optional options. In the following example file, the first command runs as soon as the Backup  System
           reads the file, whereas the other commands are themselves scheduled; the specified date and time must
           be later than the date and time at which the Backup System reads the file.

              dump user /sunday1/wednesday -port 1
              dump sun4x_56 /sunday1/friday -port 2 -at 04/08/1999
              dump sun4x_55 /sunday1/friday -port 2 -at 04/08/1999 02:00 -append

           Do not combine this argument with the <b>-volumeset</b>, <b>-dump</b>, <b>-portoffset</b>, <b>-append</b>, or <b>-dryrun</b> options.

       <b>-localauth</b>
           Constructs  a  server  ticket using a key from the local <u>/etc/openafs/server/KeyFile</u> file. The <b>backup</b>
           command interpreter presents it to the Backup Server, Volume  Server  and  VL  Server  during  mutual
           authentication. Do not combine this flag with the <b>-cell</b> argument. For more details, see <b><a href="../man8/backup.8.html">backup</a></b>(8).

       <b>-cell</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           Names  the  cell  in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument with the <b>-localauth</b> flag.
           For more details, see <b><a href="../man8/backup.8.html">backup</a></b>(8).

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The command interpreter first generates a list of the volumes to be included in the dump by matching  the
       entries  in  the  volume set against the volumes listed in the Volume Location Database (VLDB). It prints
       the list following the header:

          Preparing to dump the following volumes:

       The following message then indicates that the command interpreter has passed  the  dump  request  to  the
       appropriate Tape Coordinator for processing:

          Starting dump.

       If the issuer includes the <b>-dryrun</b> flag, the output is of the following form:

          Starting dump of volume set '&lt;volume set&gt;' (dump set '&lt;dump level&gt;')
          Total number of volumes : &lt;number dumped&gt;
          Would have dumped the following volumes:
          &lt;list_of_volumes&gt;

       where <u>list_of_volumes</u> identifies each volume by name and volume ID number.

       If  the  Tape  Coordinator  is  unable  to  access a volume, it prints an error message in its window and
       records the error in its log and error files.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  command  dumps  the  volumes  in  the  volume  set  called  "user"  at  the  dump   level
       "/full/sunday2/monday". The issuer places the necessary tapes in the device with port offset 5.

          % backup dump -volumeset user -dump /full/sunday2/monday -portoffset 5
          Preparing to dump the following volumes:
          user.jones.backup   387623900
          user.pat.backup     486219245
          user.smith.backup   597315841
                 .                .
                 .                .
          Starting dump.

       The  following command displays the list of volumes to be dumped when the user dumps the "sys_sun" volume
       set at the "/full" dump level.

          % backup dump -volumeset sys_sun -dump /full -dryrun
          Starting dump of volume set 'sys_sun' (dump set '/full')
          Total number of volumes: 24
          Would have dumped the following volumes:
          sun4x_56      124857238
          sun4x_56.bin  124857241
              .            .
              .            .
          sun4x_55      124857997
              .            .
              .            .

       The following command schedules a dump of the volumes  in  the  volume  set  "user"  at  the  dump  level
       "/sunday2/monday1"  for  11:00  p.m.  on 14 June 1999. The appropriate Tape Coordinator has port offset 0
       (zero), so that argument is omitted.

          % backup dump -volumeset user -dump /sunday2/monday1 -at 06/14/1999 23:00

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>REQUIRED</b></h4><pre>
       The issuer must be listed in the <u>/etc/openafs/server/UserList</u> file on  every  machine  where  the  Backup
       Server  or  Volume  Location  (VL)  Server  is  running,  and on every file server machine that houses an
       affected volume. If the <b>-localauth</b> flag is included, the issuer must instead be logged  on  to  a  server
       machine as the local superuser "root".
