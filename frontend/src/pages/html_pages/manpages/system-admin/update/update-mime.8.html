</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       update-mime - create or update MIME information

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>update-mime</b> [no parameters]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>update-mime</b>  updates the <b>/etc/mailcap</b> file to reflect mime information changed by a Debian package during
       installation or removal.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--local</b> Generate files in the current user's home directory instead of the <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> directory.   This  allows
       users  to  create  a custom ordering configuration and get a complete <u><a href="file:~/.mailcap">~/.mailcap</a></u> file out of it.  In this
       local mode, the order overriding file (see below) will be looked for in the <u><a href="file:~/.mailcap.order">~/.mailcap.order</a></u> file.

</pre><h4><b>OVERRIDING</b> <b>ORDER</b></h4><pre>
       The order of entries in the <u>/etc/mailcap</u> file can be altered  by  editing  the  <u>/etc/mailcap.order</u>  file.
       Please see the <b><a href="../man5/mailcap.order.5.html">mailcap.order</a></b>(5) man page for more information.

</pre><h4><b>CREATING</b> <b>ENTRIES</b></h4><pre>
       To  create  entries  in  the  mailcap  file, packages need to create a file in the <u><a href="file:/usr/lib/mime/packages">/usr/lib/mime/packages</a></u>
       directory.  In this file goes the verbatim desired mailcap entries.  In addition to the standard  mailcap
       options  (described  below) is a new <u>priority</u> option.  Specifying this will provide for simple ranking of
       programs within a given mime type.  An animation viewer, for example, may be able  to  display  a  static
       picture,  but  probably  wouldn't  be  the  best  choice  and  so would give an option like "priority=2".
       Priorities range from 0 to 9, with 0 being the lowest and 9 being the highest.  If the <u>priority</u> option is
       omitted, a value of 5 is used.

       The following are standard options that can be specified in the mailcap entry.  Options are separated  by
       semicolons (;) but must all be on the same line.  Each line should look like:

         mime/type; viewer; option; another=val; etc; priority=5

       Mime  types  of  the  form "class/*" and even "*/*" are now acceptable (they were previously disallowed).
       When using "class/*", it is probably a good idea to add a "priority=[1-4]" option so specific rules using
       the default priority will get chosen first.   If  using  "*/*",  though,  you  probably  want  to  add  a
       "priority=0" option to make that rule a "last resort".

   <b>Commands</b>
       <b>&lt;program-string&gt;</b>
              Specifies the program to run to view a file of the given content-type.  <b>This</b> <b>option</b> <b>setting</b> <b>cannot</b>
              <b>be</b>  <b>omitted.</b>   An implicit "view=" can be considered before it.  When writing an entry that has no
              viewer, use a value of <u>false</u> in this space.

       <b>compose=</b><u>&lt;program-string&gt;</u>
              The "compose" command may be used to specify a program that can be used to compose a new  body  or
              body  part in the given format.  Its intended use is to support mail composing agents that support
              the composition of multiple types of mail using external composing  agents.   The  result  of  the
              composing  program  may be data that is not yet suitable for mail transport -- that is, a Content-
              Transfer-Encoding may need to be applied to the data.

       <b>composetyped=</b><u>&lt;program-string&gt;</u>
              The "composetyped" command is similar to "compose", but is to be used when the  composing  program
              needs  to specify the Content-type header field to be applied to the composed data.  The "compose"
              option is simpler, and is  preferred  for  use  with  existing  (non-mail-oriented)  programs  for
              composing  data  in  a given format.  The "composetyped" option is necessary when the Content-type
              information must include auxiliary parameters, and the composition program must then  know  enough
              about mail formats to produce output that includes the mail type information.

       <b>edit=</b><u>&lt;program-string&gt;</u>
              The  "edit"  command may be used to specify a program that can be used to edit a body or body part
              in the given format.  In many cases, it may be identical in content to the "compose" command.

       <b>print=</b><u>&lt;program-string&gt;</u>
              The "print" command may be used to specify a program that can be used to print a message  or  body
              part in the given format.

   <b>Modifiers</b>
       These options are modifiers to all the commands specified on the command line.

       <b>test=</b><u>&lt;conditional&gt;</u>
              The  "test" option may be used to test some external condition (e.g., the machine architecture, or
              the window system in use) to determine whether or not the mailcap line applies.   It  specifies  a
              program  to  be run to test some condition.  If the test fails, a subsequent mailcap entry will be
              sought.  Multiple test options are not permitted -- since a  test  can  call  a  program,  it  can
              already be arbitrarily complex.

              <b>Note:</b> When testing for X by looking at the <u>DISPLAY</u> environment variable, please use one of:

                      test=test -z "$DISPLAY"     (no X)
                or    test=test -n "$DISPLAY"     (have X)

              Many programs recognize these strings and optimize for them.

       <b>needsterminal</b>
              The  "needsterminal"  option,  if given, indicates that the commands must be run on an interactive
              terminal.  This is needed to inform window-oriented user agents that an  interactive  terminal  is
              needed.  (The decision is not left exclusively to the command because in some circumstances it may
              not  be possible for such programs to tell whether or not they are on interactive terminals.)  The
              needsterminal command applies to the view, compose and edit commands, if they  exist.   Note  that
              this  is  NOT  a  test  --  it  is  a requirement for the environment in which the program will be
              executed, and will typically cause the creation of a terminal window when not executed on either a
              real terminal or a terminal window.

       <b>copiousoutput</b>
              The "copiousoutput" option, if given, indicates that the output from the view-command will  be  an
              extended  stream  of  output and is to be interpreted as advice to the UA (User Agent mail-reading
              program) that the output should be either paged or made scrollable.  Note that it  is  probably  a
              mistake if needsterminal and copiousoutput are both specified.

   <b>Content-Type</b> <b>Info</b>
       These options provide additional information about the given content-type.

       <b>description=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              The "description" option simply provides a textual description that describes the type of data, to
              be used optionally by mail readers that wish to describe the data before offering to display it.

       <b>textualnewlines</b>
              The  "textualnewlines"  option,  if  given,  indicates that this type of data is line-oriented and
              that, if encoded in a binary format, all newlines should be converted  to  canonical  form  (CRLF)
              before  encoding,  and  will  be  in that form after decoding.  In general, this is needed only if
              there is line-oriented data of some type other than text/* or non-line-oriented  data  that  is  a
              subtype of text.

       <b>x11-bitmap=</b><u>&lt;pathname&gt;</u>
              The  "x11-bitmap"  option names a file, in X11 bitmap (xbm) format, which points to an appropriate
              icon to be used to visually denote the presence of this kind of data.

       <b>nametemplate=</b><u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              The "nametemplate" option gives a file name format, in which %s will be replaced by a short unique
              string to give the name of the temporary file to be passed to the viewing command.  This  is  only
              expected  to be relevant in environments where filename extensions are meaningful, e.g., one could
              specify that a GIF file being passed to a gif viewer should have a name ending in ".gif" by  using
              "nametemplate=%s.gif".

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       Packages that wish to provide MIME access to themselves should <b>not</b> depend on, recommend, or suggest <b>mime-</b>
       <b>support,</b> as the the file they create in <u><a href="file:/usr/lib/mime/packages">/usr/lib/mime/packages</a></u> will cause <b>update-mime</b> to be automatically
       run via a Dpkg trigger.

</pre><h4><b>DESKTOP</b> <b>ENTRIES</b></h4><pre>
       In   addition   to   the   abovementioned   mechanism   <b>update-mime</b>   also   parses  desktop  entries  in
       <a href="file:/usr/share/applications/">/usr/share/applications/</a> to generate mailcap entries. These entries are given a lower priority than those
       in /usr/lib/mime/packages.
