       bfb-install - BFB installing script for BlueField SoC over rshim driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bfb-install</b>  -b,  --bfb  &lt;bfb_file&gt; -r, --rshim [&lt;ip:&gt;[:port]:]rshim&lt;N&gt; [-c, --config &lt;config_file&gt;] [-f,
       --rootfs &lt;rootfs_file&gt;] [-h, --help] [-k, --keep-log] [-m, --remote-mode &lt;scp|nc|ncpipe&gt;] [-R, --reverse-
       nc] [-u, --runtime] [-v, --verbose]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       bfb-install is a utility script to install BFB images on BlueField SoC over the rshim driver.

       When the "--rshim" option doesn't provide an "ip" argument, the script will run in local mode and try  to
       access the local rshim device and install the BFB image through it.

       When the "--rshim" option provides an "ip" argument, the script will run in remote mode and try to access
       the remote rshim device and install the BFB image through it.  There are three remote modes: "scp", "nc",
       and  "ncpipe".  The default remote mode is "scp". "scp" uses the scp command to transfer the BFB image to
       the remote rshim device. "nc" uses the nc command to transfer the BFB image to the remote  rshim  device.
       "ncpipe" is similar to "nc" but uses a named pipe on the remote device to help transfer the BFB image and
       achieve faster speed.

       The  "--reverse-nc"  flag,  used with "nc" or "ncpipe" remote modes, enables a reversed connection method
       where the remote host operates as a netcat server  and  the  local  host,  as  a  client,  initiates  the
       connection.  This  method is particularly useful for environments with firewall restrictions on the local
       host side.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -b, --bfb

              This is the BFB image to use, which is pushed as the boot stream.

       -c, --config

              This is an optional configuration file to use, usually called bf.cfg.

       -f, --rootfs

              This is the optional rootfs tar.xz file which is uaually used when installing Yocto.

       -h, --help

              Show the help message.

       -k, --keep-log

              Do not clear rshim log buffer after reading during bfb install.

       -m , --remote-mode

              Specify the remote mode to use. The default mode is "scp". The available modes  are  "scp",  "nc",
              and "ncpipe".

       -r, --rshim

              This  is the rshim device to use, in the format of [&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;:]rshim&lt;N&gt;. The "ip" and "port" are
              optional and only used when the remote mode is specified.  These two fields will be  ignored  when
              the  remote mode is not specified. Both IP address and host name are supported for the "ip" field.
              If the port is not provided, the default port 9527 is used. The "N" is the  rshim  device  number,
              usually 0 or 1.

       -R, --reverse-nc

              Enables  a  reverse  connection for "nc" and "ncpipe" modes, allowing the local host to initiate a
              connection to a netcat server running on the remote.

       -u, --runtime

              Run upgrade in runtime mode (BF3 + local rshim only).

       -v, --verbose
              Show verbose output.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To install a BFB image using the host rshim method:

              bfb-install --bfb bluefield.bfb --rshim rshim0

       To install a BFB image using the BMC rshim scp method:

              bfb-install --bfb bluefield.bfb --rshim 10.15.8.200:rshim0

       To install a BFB image using the BMC rshim nc method:

              bfb-install --bfb bluefield.bfb --rshim 10.15.8.200:rshim0 --remote-mode nc

       To install a BFB image using the BMC rshim ncpipe method with custom port number and verbose output:

              bfb-install --bfb bluefield.bfb --rshim 10.15.8.200:9709:rshim0 --remote-mode ncpie --verbose

       To install a BFB image in local mode with a custom configuration file:

              bfb-install --bfb bluefield.bfb --rshim rshim0 --config bf.cfg

       To install a BFB image with the BMC rshim  using  the  netcat  pipe  method  and  a  reverse  connection,
       specifying a local port within the rshim value:

              bfb-install --bfb bluefield.bfb --rshim 10.15.8.200:9709:rshim0 --remote-mode ncpipe --reverse-nc

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       When using remote mode nc or ncpipe, there's a short window of time when there is a netcat server running
       on  the local or remote host on the specified TCP port (default 9527). This could be a potential security
       risk. So these two methods should only be used on a secure network  and  the  security  implications  are
       understood.
