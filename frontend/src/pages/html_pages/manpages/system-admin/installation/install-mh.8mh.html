</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       install-mh - initialize the nmh environment

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>/usr/lib/mh/install-mh</b> [<b>-help</b>] [<b>-version</b>] [<b>-auto</b>] [<b>-check</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>install-mh</b> creates the initial setup for a first-time <b>nmh</b> user.  <b>install-mh</b> is installed in two locations
       for historical reasons.

       The <b>-auto</b> switch does things as automatically as possible and makes <b>install-mh</b> less chatty.

       The user is prompted for the name of the directory to be designated as the user's <b>nmh</b> directory.  If this
       directory  does not exist, the user is asked if it should be created.  Normally, this directory should be
       under the user's home directory, and has the default  name  of  <u>`Mail'</u>.   <b>install-mh</b>  writes  an  initial
       <u>.mh_profile</u> for the user.

       As  with  all  <b>nmh</b>  commands,  <b>install-mh</b> first checks for the existence of the <b>$MH</b> environment variable,
       since that, if set, gives the profile path.  If it isn't set, the <b>$HOME</b> environment variable is consulted
       to determine the user's home directory.  If <b>$HOME</b> is not set, then the <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u> file is consulted.

       When creating the user's <u>.mh_profile</u>, <b>install-mh</b> will check for the existence  of  a  global  profile  at
       <u>/etc/nmh/mh.profile</u>.  If found, this will be used to initialize the new <u>.mh_profile</u>.

       The  <b>-check</b>  switch  checks if <b>nmh</b> is installed.  (This can be used by other programs to determine if <b>nmh</b>
       has been installed.)

       <b>install-mh</b> sets up the user's profile to support the <u><a href="../man5/mh-draft.5.html">mh-draft</a></u>(5) draft folder facility.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       $HOME/.mh_profile   The user's profile.
       /etc/nmh/mh.profile Used to initialize user's profile.

</pre><h4><b>PROFILE</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Path:               To set the user's nmh directory.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man5/mh-draft.5.html">mh-draft</a></u>(5)

</pre><h4><b>CONTEXT</b></h4><pre>
       With <b>-auto</b>, the current folder is changed to “<u>inbox</u>”.

</pre><h4><b>UNDOING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       If you only ran install-mh to try out <b>nmh</b> briefly, you might like to remove the  configuration  files  it
       creates.  (This  is not obligatory -- <b>install-mh</b> creates only a few small files so simply leaving them in
       place will not cause problems.)

       Most <b>nmh</b> configuration information lives in the user's <b>nmh</b> directory; you can print its name by running

       <b>mhpath</b> <b>+</b>

       Basically all plain files in the <b>nmh</b> directory are configuration files and can be removed.

       <u>Attention:</u> The <b>nmh</b> directory holds not just configuration  files!  Its  subdirectories  contain  all  the
       emails  you have written or received with <b>nmh.</b>  Don't delete the <b>nmh</b> directory without carefully checking
       that there are no mail files that you might want later!

       The only configuration file that lives outside the <b>nmh</b> directory is your profile file. You can print  its
       name by running

       <b>echo</b> <b>${MH:-$HOME/.mh-profile}</b>

       If you aren't using nmh any more you can delete this file, too.
