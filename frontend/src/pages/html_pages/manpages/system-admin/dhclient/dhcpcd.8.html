</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dhcpcd</b>  is  an implementation of the DHCP client specified in <b>RFC</b> <b>2131</b>.  <b>dhcpcd</b> gets the host information
       (IP address, routes, etc) from a DHCP server and configures the network <u>interface</u> of the machine on which
       it is running.  <b>dhcpcd</b> then runs the configuration script which writes DNS information to  <u><a href="../man8/resolvconf.8.html">resolvconf</a></u>(8),
       if  available,  otherwise  directly  to  <u><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></u>.  If the hostname is currently blank, (null) or
       localhost, or <u>force_hostname</u> is YES or TRUE or 1 then <b>dhcpcd</b> sets the hostname to the one supplied by the
       DHCP server.  <b>dhcpcd</b> then daemonises and waits for the lease renewal time to lapse.  It will then attempt
       to renew its lease and reconfigure if the new lease changes when the lease begins to expire or  the  DHCP
       server sends a message to renew early.

       If  any  interface reports a working carrier then <b>dhcpcd</b> will try to obtain a lease before forking to the
       background, otherwise it will fork right away.  This behaviour can be modified with the <b>-b</b>,  <b>--background</b>
       and <b>-w</b>, <b>--waitip</b> options.

       <b>dhcpcd</b> is also an implementation of the BOOTP client specified in <b>RFC</b> <b>951</b>.

       <b>dhcpcd</b> is also an implementation of the IPv6 Router Solicitor as specified in <b>RFC</b> <b>4861</b> and <b>RFC</b> <b>6106</b>.

       <b>dhcpcd</b>  is  also  an  implementation of the IPv6 Privacy Extensions to AutoConf as specified in <b>RFC</b> <b>4941</b>.
       This feature needs to be enabled in the kernel and <b>dhcpcd</b> will start using it.

       <b>dhcpcd</b> is also an implementation of the DHCPv6 client as specified in <b>RFC</b> <b>3315</b>.  By default, <b>dhcpcd</b>  only
       starts  DHCPv6  when  instructed to do so by an IPV6 Router Advertisement.  If no Identity Association is
       configured, then a Non-temporary Address is requested.

   <b>Local</b> <b>Link</b> <b>configuration</b>
       If <b>dhcpcd</b> failed to obtain a lease, it probes for a valid IPv4LL address (aka ZeroConf, aka APIPA).  Once
       obtained it restarts the process of looking for a DHCP server to get a proper address.

       When using IPv4LL, <b>dhcpcd</b> nearly always succeeds and returns an exit code of 0.   In  the  rare  case  it
       fails, it normally means that there is a reverse ARP proxy installed which always defeats IPv4LL probing.
       To disable this behaviour, you can use the <b>-L</b>, <b>--noipv4ll</b> option.

   <b>Multiple</b> <b>interfaces</b>
       If  a  list  of  interfaces  are given on the command line, then <b>dhcpcd</b> only works with those interfaces,
       otherwise <b>dhcpcd</b> discovers available Ethernet interfaces that can be  configured.   When  <b>dhcpcd</b>  is  not
       limited  to  one  interface  on  the  command line, it is running in Manager mode.  The <b>dhcpcd-ui</b> project
       expects dhcpcd to be running this way.

       If a single interface is given then <b>dhcpcd</b> only works for that interface and runs as a separate  instance
       to other <b>dhcpcd</b> processes.  The <b>-w</b>, <b>--waitip</b> option is enabled in this instance to maintain compatibility
       with  older  versions.  Using a single interface, optionally further limited to an address protocol, also
       affects the <b>-k</b>, <b>-N</b>, <b>-n</b> and <b>-x</b> options, where the same interface and any address protocol will need to  be
       specified,  as  a  lack  of an interface will imply Manager mode which this is not.  To force starting in
       Manager mode with only one interface, the <b>-M</b>, <b>--manager</b> option can be used.

       Interfaces are preferred by carrier, DHCP lease/IPv4LL and then lowest metric.  For systems that  support
       route  metrics, each route will be tagged with the metric, otherwise <b>dhcpcd</b> changes the routes to use the
       interface with the same route and the lowest metric.  See options below for controlling which  interfaces
       we allow and deny through the use of patterns.

       Non-ethernet  interfaces  and  some  virtual  ethernet  interfaces  such as TAP and bridge are ignored by
       default, as is the FireWire interface.  To work with these devices they either need to  be  specified  on
       the command line, be listed in <b>--allowinterfaces</b> or have an interface directive in <u><a href="file:/etc/dhcpcd.conf">/etc/dhcpcd.conf</a></u>.

   <b>Hooking</b> <b>into</b> <b>events</b>
       <b>dhcpcd</b>  runs  <u><a href="file:/usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-run-hooks">/usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-run-hooks</a></u>, or the script specified by the <b>-c</b>, <b>--script</b> option.  This
       script runs  each  script  found  in  <u><a href="file:/usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks">/usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks</a></u>  in  a  lexical  order.   The  default
       installation  supplies  the scripts <u>01-test</u>, <u>20-resolv.conf</u> and <u>30-hostname</u>.  You can disable each script
       by using the <b>-C</b>, <b>--nohook</b> option.  See <u><a href="../man8/dhcpcd-run-hooks.8.html">dhcpcd-run-hooks</a></u>(8) for details on how these scripts work.  <b>dhcpcd</b>
       currently ignores the exit code of the script.

       More   scripts   are   supplied   in   <u><a href="file:/usr/share/dhcpcd/hooks">/usr/share/dhcpcd/hooks</a></u>    and    need    to    be    copied    to
       <u><a href="file:/usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks">/usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks</a></u>   if   you   intend   to   use   them.    For  example,  you  could  install
       <u>29-lookup-hostname</u> so that <b>dhcpcd</b> can lookup the hostname of the IP address in  DNS  if  no  hostname  is
       given by the lease and one is not already set.

   <b>Fine</b> <b>tuning</b>
       You can fine-tune the behaviour of <b>dhcpcd</b> with the following options:

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--background</b>
               Background immediately.  This is useful for startup scripts which don't disable link messages for
               carrier status.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--script</b> <u>script</u>
               Use this <u>script</u> instead of the default <u><a href="file:/usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-run-hooks">/usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-run-hooks</a></u>.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--duid</b> [<u>ll</u> | <u>lt</u> | <u>uuid</u> | <u>value</u>]
               Use  a  DHCP  Unique  Identifier.  If persistent storage is available then a DUID-LLT (link local
               address + time) is generated, otherwise DUID-LL is generated (link local address).  The DUID type
               can be hinted as an optional parameter if the file <u><a href="file:/var/lib/dhcpcd/duid">/var/lib/dhcpcd/duid</a></u> does not exist.   If  not
               <u>ll</u>, <u>lt</u> or <u>uuid</u> then <u>value</u> will be converted from 00:11:22:33 format.  This, plus the IAID will be
               used  as  the <b>-I</b>, <b>--clientid</b>.  The DUID generated will be held in <u><a href="file:/var/lib/dhcpcd/duid">/var/lib/dhcpcd/duid</a></u> and should
               not be copied to other hosts.  This file also takes precedence over the above  rules  except  for
               setting a value.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
               Echo debug messages to the stderr and syslog.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--lastlease</b>
               If <b>dhcpcd</b> cannot obtain a lease, then try to use the last lease acquired for the interface.

       <b>--lastleaseextend</b>
               Same  as the above, but the lease will be retained even if it expires.  <b>dhcpcd</b> will give it up if
               any other host tries to claim it for their own via ARP.  This violates  RFC  2131,  section  3.7,
               which states the lease should be dropped once it has expired.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--env</b> <u>value</u>
               Push  <u>value</u>  to  the  environment for use in <u><a href="../man8/dhcpcd-run-hooks.8.html">dhcpcd-run-hooks</a></u>(8).  For example, you can force the
               hostname hook to always set the hostname with <b>-e</b> <u>force_hostname=YES</u>.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--reconfigure</b>
               <b>dhcpcd</b> will re-apply IP address, routing and run <u><a href="../man8/dhcpcd-run-hooks.8.html">dhcpcd-run-hooks</a></u>(8) for each interface.  This is
               useful so that a 3rd party such as PPP or VPN can change the routing table and / or DNS, etc  and
               then  instruct  <b>dhcpcd</b>  to  put things back afterwards.  <b>dhcpcd</b> does not read a new configuration
               when this happens - you should rebind if you need that functionality.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--fqdn</b> <u>fqdn</u>
               Requests that the DHCP server update DNS using FQDN instead of just a hostname.  Valid values for
               <u>fqdn</u> are disable, none, ptr and both.  <b>dhcpcd</b> itself never does any DNS updates.  <b>dhcpcd</b>  encodes
               the FQDN hostname as specified in <b>RFC</b> <b>1035</b>.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--config</b> <u>file</u>
               Specify  a  config  to load instead of <u><a href="file:/etc/dhcpcd.conf">/etc/dhcpcd.conf</a></u>.  <b>dhcpcd</b> always processes the config file
               before any command line options.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--hostname</b> <u>hostname</u>
               Sends <u>hostname</u> to the DHCP server so it can be registered in DNS.  If <u>hostname</u> is an empty string
               then the current system hostname is sent.  If <u>hostname</u> is a FQDN (i.e., contains  a  .)  then  it
               will be encoded as such.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--clientid</b> <u>clientid</u>
               Send  the  <u>clientid</u>.   If  the  string  is of the format 01:02:03 then it is encoded as hex.  For
               interfaces whose hardware address is longer than 8 bytes, or if the <u>clientid</u> is an  empty  string
               then <b>dhcpcd</b> sends a default <u>clientid</u> of the hardware family and the hardware address.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--vendorclassid</b> <u>vendorclassid</u>
               Override      the      DHCPv4      <u>vendorclassid</u>      field     sent.      The     default     is
               dhcpcd-&lt;version&gt;:&lt;os&gt;:&lt;machine&gt;:&lt;platform&gt;.  For example
                     dhcpcd-5.5.6:NetBSD-6.99.5:i386:i386
               If not set then none is sent.  Some badly configured DHCP servers reject unknown  vendorclassids.
               To work around it, try and impersonate Windows by using the MSFT vendorclassid.

       <b>-j</b>, <b>--logfile</b> <u>logfile</u>
               Writes to the specified <u>logfile</u>.  <b>dhcpcd</b> still writes to <u><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></u>(3).  The <u>logfile</u> is reopened when
               <b>dhcpcd</b> receives the SIGUSR2 signal.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--release</b> [<u>interface</u>]
               This  causes  an  existing  <b>dhcpcd</b>  process running on the <u>interface</u> to release its lease and de-
               configure the <u>interface</u> regardless of the <b>-p</b>, <b>--persistent</b> option.  If no <u>interface</u> is  specified
               then  this  applies to all interfaces in Manager mode.  If no interfaces are left running, <b>dhcpcd</b>
               will exit.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--leasetime</b> <u>seconds</u>
               Request a lease time of <u>seconds</u>.  <u>-1</u> represents an infinite lease time.  By default  <b>dhcpcd</b>  does
               not request any lease time and leaves it in the hands of the DHCP server.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--manager</b>
               Start  <b>dhcpcd</b>  in Manager mode even if only one interface specified on the command line.  See the
               Multiple Interfaces section above.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--metric</b> <u>metric</u>
               Metrics are used to prefer an interface over another one, lowest  wins.   <b>dhcpcd</b>  will  supply  a
               default metric of 1000 + <u><a href="../man3/if_nametoindex.3.html">if_nametoindex</a></u>(3).  This will be offset by 2000 for wireless interfaces,
               with additional offsets of 1000000 for IPv4LL and 2000000 for roaming interfaces.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--rebind</b> [<u>interface</u>]
               Notifies  <b>dhcpcd</b> to reload its configuration and rebind the specified <u>interface</u>.  If no <u>interface</u>
               is specified then this applies to all interfaces in Manager mode.  If <b>dhcpcd</b> is not running, then
               it starts up as normal.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--renew</b> [<u>interface</u>]
               Notifies <b>dhcpcd</b> to renew existing addresses on the  specified  <u>interface</u>.   If  no  <u>interface</u>  is
               specified then this applies to all interfaces in Manager mode.  If <b>dhcpcd</b> is not running, then it
               starts  up  as normal.  Unlike the <b>-n</b>, <b>--rebind</b> option above, the configuration for <b>dhcpcd</b> is not
               reloaded.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--option</b> <u>option</u>
               Request the DHCP <u>option</u> variable for use in <u><a href="file:/usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-run-hooks">/usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-run-hooks</a></u>.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--persistent</b>
               <b>dhcpcd</b> de-configures the <u>interface</u> when it exits unless this option is enabled.  Sometimes,  this
               isn't  desirable  if,  for example, you have root mounted over NFS or SSH clients connect to this
               host and they need to be notified of the host shutting down.  You can use  this  option  to  stop
               this from happening.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--request</b> <u>address</u>
               Request  the <u>address</u> in the DHCP DISCOVER message.  There is no guarantee this is the address the
               DHCP server will actually give.  If no <u>address</u> is given then the first address currently assigned
               to the <u>interface</u> is used.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--inform</b> <u>address</u>[<u>/cidr</u>[<u>/broadcast_address</u>]]
               Behaves like <b>-r</b>, <b>--request</b> as above, but sends a DHCP INFORM instead of  DISCOVER/REQUEST.   This
               does  not  get  a lease as such, just notifies the DHCP server of the <u>address</u> in use.  You should
               also include the optional <u>cidr</u> network number in case the address is not  already  configured  on
               the  interface.   <b>dhcpcd</b>  remains running and pretends it has an infinite lease.  <b>dhcpcd</b> will not
               de-configure the interface when it exits.  If <b>dhcpcd</b> fails to  contact  a  DHCP  server  then  it
               returns a failure instead of falling back on IPv4LL.

       <b>--inform6</b>
               Performs  a  DHCPv6  Information  Request.   No  address is requested or specified, but all other
               DHCPv6 options are allowed.  This is  normally  performed  automatically  when  the  IPv6  Router
               Advertises that the client should perform this operation.  This option is only needed when <b>dhcpcd</b>
               is not processing IPv6RA messages and the need for DHCPv6 Information Request exists.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--static</b> <u>value</u>
               Configures  a  static DHCP <u>value</u>.  If you set <b>ip_address</b> then <b>dhcpcd</b> will not attempt to obtain a
               lease and just use the value for the address with an infinite lease time.

               Here is an example which configures a static address, routes and DNS.
                     dhcpcd -S ip_address=192.168.0.10/24 \
                     -S routers=192.168.0.1 \
                     -S domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1 \
                     eth0

               You cannot presently set static DHCPv6 values.  Use the <b>-e</b>, <b>--env</b> option instead.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--timeout</b> <u>seconds</u>
               Timeout after <u>seconds</u>, instead of the default 30.  On  timeout,  <b>dhcpcd</b>  will  exit  if  the  <b>-1</b>,
               <b>--oneshot</b>  option  has been given, otherwise it will fork into the background and keep on trying.
               A setting of 0 <u>seconds</u> causes <b>dhcpcd</b> to wait forever to get a lease.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--userclass</b> <u>class</u>
               Tags the DHCPv4 message with the userclass <u>class</u>.  DHCP servers use this to give members  of  the
               class DHCP options other than the default, without having to know things like hardware address or
               hostname.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--vendor</b> <u>code</u>,<u>value</u>
               Add  an  encapsulated  vendor  option.  <u>code</u> should be between 1 and 254 inclusive.  To add a raw
               vendor string, omit <u>code</u> but keep the comma.  Examples.

               Set the vendor option 01 with an IP address.
                     dhcpcd -v 01,192.168.0.2 eth0
               Set the vendor option 02 with a hex code.
                     dhcpcd -v 02,01:02:03:04:05 eth0
               Set the vendor option 03 with an IP address as a string.
                     dhcpcd -v 03,\"192.168.0.2\" eth0
               Set un-encapsulated vendor option to hello world.
                     dhcpcd -v ,"hello world" eth0

       <b>--version</b>
               Display both program version and copyright information.   <b>dhcpcd</b>  then  exits  before  doing  any
               configuration.

       <b>-w</b>      Wait  for an address to be assigned before forking to the background.  Does not take an argument,
               unlike the below option.

       <b>--waitip</b>=[4 | 6]
               Wait for an address to be assigned before forking to the background.  4 means wait  for  an  IPv4
               address  to  be  assigned.   6  means wait for an IPv6 address to be assigned.  If no argument is
               given, <b>dhcpcd</b> will wait for any address protocol to be assigned.  It is possible to wait for more
               than one address protocol and <b>dhcpcd</b> will only fork to the background when all waiting conditions
               are satisfied.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--exit</b> [<u>interface</u>]
               This will signal an existing <b>dhcpcd</b> process running on the <u>interface</u> to exit.  If no <u>interface</u> is
               specified, then the above is applied to all interfaces in Manager mode.  See the <b>-p</b>, <b>--persistent</b>
               option  to  control  configuration  persistence  on  exit,  which  is  enabled  by   default   in
               <u><a href="../man5/dhcpcd.conf.5.html">dhcpcd.conf</a></u>(5).  <b>dhcpcd</b> then waits until this process has exited.

       <b>-y</b>, <b>--reboot</b> <u>seconds</u>
               Allow  <u>reboot</u>  seconds before moving to the discover phase if we have an old lease to use.  Allow
               <u>reboot</u> seconds before starting fallback states from the discover phase.  IPv4LL is  started  when
               the  first  <u>reboot</u>  timeout is reached.  The default is 5 seconds.  A setting of 0 seconds causes
               <b>dhcpcd</b> to skip the reboot phase and go straight into discover.  This  has  no  effect  on  DHCPv6
               other than skipping the reboot phase.

   <b>Restricting</b> <b>behaviour</b>
       <b>dhcpcd</b>  will  try  to do as much as it can by default.  However, there are sometimes situations where you
       don't want the things to be configured exactly how the DHCP server wants.  Here  are  some  options  that
       deal with turning these bits off.

       Note  that  when <b>dhcpcd</b> is restricted to a single interface then the interface also needs to be specified
       when asking <b>dhcpcd</b> to exit using the commandline.  If  the  protocol  is  restricted  as  well  then  the
       protocol needs to be included with the exit instruction.

       <b>-1</b>, <b>--oneshot</b>
               Exit after configuring an interface.  Use the <b>-w</b>, <b>--waitip</b> option to specify which protocol(s) to
               configure before exiting.

       <b>-4</b>, <b>--ipv4only</b>
               Configure IPv4 only.

       <b>-6</b>, <b>--ipv6only</b>
               Configure IPv6 only.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--noarp</b>
               Don't request or claim the address by ARP.  This also disables IPv4LL.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--nobackground</b>
               Don't run in the background when we acquire a lease.  This is mainly useful for running under the
               control of another process, such as a debugger or a network manager.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--nohook</b> <u>script</u>
               Don't run this hook script.  Matches full name, or prefixed with 2 numbers optionally ending with
               <u>.sh</u>.

               So to stop <b>dhcpcd</b> from touching your DNS settings you would do:-
                     dhcpcd -C resolv.conf eth0

       <b>-G</b>, <b>--nogateway</b>
               Don't set any default routes.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--xidhwaddr</b>
               Use  the  last four bytes of the hardware address as the DHCP xid instead of a randomly generated
               number.

       <b>-J</b>, <b>--broadcast</b>
               Instructs the DHCP server to broadcast replies back to the client.  Normally this is only set for
               non-Ethernet interfaces, such as FireWire and InfiniBand.  In most  instances,  <b>dhcpcd</b>  will  set
               this automatically.

       <b>-K</b>, <b>--nolink</b>
               Don't  receive  link  messages  for  carrier status.  You should only have to use this with buggy
               device drivers or running <b>dhcpcd</b> through a network manager.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--noipv4ll</b>
               Don't use IPv4LL (aka APIPA, aka Bonjour, aka ZeroConf).

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--nooption</b> <u>option</u>
               Removes the <u>option</u> from the DHCP message before processing.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--printpidfile</b>
               Print the <u>pidfile</u> <b>dhcpcd</b> will use based on command-line arguments to stdout.

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--require</b> <u>option</u>
               Requires the <u>option</u> to be present in all DHCP messages, otherwise the  message  is  ignored.   To
               enforce  that  <b>dhcpcd</b>  only  responds  to  DHCP  servers  and  not  BOOTP  servers,  you  can  <b>-Q</b>
               <u>dhcp_message_type</u>.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
               Quiet <b>dhcpcd</b> on the command line, only warnings and errors will be displayed.  If this option  is
               used  another  time  then  all  console  output is disabled.  These messages are still logged via
               <u><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></u>(3).

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--test</b>
               On receipt of DHCP messages just call <u><a href="file:/usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-run-hooks">/usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-run-hooks</a></u> with the  reason  of  TEST
               which  echos the DHCP variables found in the message to the console.  The interface configuration
               isn't touched and neither are any configuration files.  The <u>rapid_commit</u> option is  not  sent  in
               TEST mode so that the server does not lease an address.  To test INFORM the interface needs to be
               configured with the desired address before starting <b>dhcpcd</b>.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--dumplease</b> [<u>interface</u>]
               Dumps  the  current  lease  for  the  <u>interface</u>  to  stdout.   If  no <u>interface</u> is given then all
               interfaces are dumped.  Use the <b>-4</b> or <b>-6</b> flags to specify an address family.  If a lease is piped
               in via standard input then use the  special  interface  named  <u>-</u>  to  dump  it.   In  this  case,
               specifying an address family is mandatory.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--variables</b>
               Display   a   list   of   option   codes,  the  associated  variable  and  encoding  for  use  in
               <u><a href="../man8/dhcpcd-run-hooks.8.html">dhcpcd-run-hooks</a></u>(8).  Variables are prefixed with new_ and old_ unless the option  number  is  -.
               Variables without an option are part of the DHCP message and cannot be directly requested.

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--whitelist</b> <u>address</u>[/cidr]
               Only accept packets from <u>address</u>[/cidr].  <b>-X</b>, <b>--blacklist</b> is ignored if <b>-W</b>, <b>--whitelist</b> is set.

       <b>-X</b>, <b>--blacklist</b> <u>address</u>[<u>/cidr</u>]
               Ignore all packets from <u>address</u>[<u>/cidr</u>].

       <b>-Z</b>, <b>--denyinterfaces</b> <u>pattern</u>
               When  discovering interfaces, the interface name must not match <u>pattern</u> which is a space or comma
               separated list of patterns passed to <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3).

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--allowinterfaces</b> <u>pattern</u>
               When discovering interfaces, the interface name must match <u>pattern</u> which  is  a  space  or  comma
               separated  list  of  patterns  passed  to  <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3).   If  the same interface is matched in <b>-Z</b>,
               <b>--denyinterfaces</b> then it is still denied.

       <b>--inactive</b>
               Don't start any interfaces other than those specified on the command line.  This allows <b>dhcpcd</b> to
               be started in Manager mode and then wait for subsequent <b>dhcpcd</b> commands to start  each  interface
               as required.

       <b>--configure</b>
               Allows   <b>dhcpcd</b>   to   configure   the   system.    This   is  the  default  behaviour  and  sets
               if_configured=true.

       <b>--noconfigure</b>
               <b>dhcpcd</b> will not configure the system at all.  This is only of use if  the  <b>--script</b>  that  <b>dhcpcd</b>
               calls  at  each  network  event configures the system instead.  This is different from <b>-T</b>, <b>--test</b>
               mode in that it's not one shot and the  only  change  to  the  environment  is  the  addition  of
               if_configured=false.

       <b>--nodev</b>
               Don't load any <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> management modules.

</pre><h4><b>3RDPARTY</b> <b>LINK</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Some  interfaces  require  configuration  by  3rd  parties,  such  as  PPP  or  VPN.   When  an interface
       configuration in <b>dhcpcd</b> is marked as STATIC or INFORM without an address then  <b>dhcpcd</b>  will  monitor  the
       interface  until  an  address  is  added  or  removed  from  it  and act accordingly.  For point to point
       interfaces (like PPP), a default route to its destination is automatically added  to  the  configuration.
       If the point to point interface is configured for INFORM, then <b>dhcpcd</b> unicasts INFORM to the destination,
       otherwise it defaults to STATIC.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dhcpcd</b>  requires  a Berkeley Packet Filter, or BPF device on BSD based systems and a Linux Socket Filter,
       or LPF device on Linux based systems for all IPv4 configuration.

       If restricting <b>dhcpcd</b> to a single interface and optionally address family via the command-line  then  all
       further calls to <b>dhcpcd</b> to rebind, reconfigure or exit need to include the same restrictive flags so that
       <b>dhcpcd</b> knows which process to signal.

       Some  DHCP  servers  implement ClientID filtering.  If <b>dhcpcd</b> is replacing an in-use DHCP client then you
       might need to adjust the clientid option <b>dhcpcd</b> sends to  match.   If  using  a  DUID  in  place  of  the
       ClientID, edit <u><a href="file:/var/lib/dhcpcd/duid">/var/lib/dhcpcd/duid</a></u> accordingly.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
