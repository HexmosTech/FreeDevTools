</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Internet  Systems  Consortium  DHCP  Client,  <b>dhclient</b>, provides a means for configuring one or more
       network interfaces using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, BOOTP protocol, or if  these  protocols
       fail, by statically assigning an address.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  DHCP protocol allows a host to contact a central server which maintains a list of IP addresses which
       may be assigned on one or more subnets.  A DHCP client may request an address from this  pool,  and  then
       use  it  on  a temporary basis for communication on network.  The DHCP protocol also provides a mechanism
       whereby a client can learn important details about the network to which  it  is  attached,  such  as  the
       location of a default router, the location of a name server, and so on.

       There  are two versions of the DHCP protocol DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.  At startup the client may be started for
       one or the other via the <b>-4</b> or <b>-6</b> options.

       On startup, <b>dhclient</b> reads the dhclient.conf for configuration instructions.  It then gets a list of  all
       the  network  interfaces  that  are configured in the current system.  For each interface, it attempts to
       configure the interface using the DHCP protocol.

       In order to keep track of leases across system reboots and server restarts,  <b>dhclient</b>  keeps  a  list  of
       leases  it  has  been  assigned in the dhclient.leases file.  On startup, after reading the dhclient.conf
       file, <b>dhclient</b> reads the dhclient.leases file to refresh  its  memory  about  what  leases  it  has  been
       assigned.

       When a new lease is acquired, it is appended to the end of the dhclient.leases file.  In order to prevent
       the  file  from becoming arbitrarily large, from time to time <b>dhclient</b> creates a new dhclient.leases file
       from its in-core lease database.  The old version of the dhclient.leases file is retained under the  name
       <u>dhclient.leases~</u> until the next time <b>dhclient</b> rewrites the database.

       Old  leases  are  kept  around  in  case  the  DHCP  server is unavailable when <b>dhclient</b> is first invoked
       (generally during the initial system boot process).  In that event, old leases from  the  dhclient.leases
       file  which  have not yet expired are tested, and if they are determined to be valid, they are used until
       either they expire or the DHCP server becomes available.

       A mobile host which may sometimes need to access a  network  on  which  no  DHCP  server  exists  may  be
       preloaded  with  a lease for a fixed address on that network.  When all attempts to contact a DHCP server
       have failed, <b>dhclient</b> will try to validate the static lease, and if it  succeeds,  will  use  that  lease
       until it is restarted.

       A  mobile  host  may  also  travel to some networks on which DHCP is not available but BOOTP is.  In that
       case, it may be advantageous to arrange with  the  network  administrator  for  an  entry  on  the  BOOTP
       database,  so  that the host can boot quickly on that network rather than cycling through the list of old
       leases.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b></h4><pre>
       The names of the network interfaces that <b>dhclient</b> should attempt to configure may  be  specified  on  the
       command  line.   If  no interface names are specified on the command line <b>dhclient</b> will normally identify
       all network interfaces, eliminating non-broadcast interfaces if possible, and attempt to  configure  each
       interface.

       It is also possible to specify interfaces by name in the dhclient.conf file.  If interfaces are specified
       in  this  way,  then  the  client  will  only  configure  interfaces  that  are  either  specified in the
       configuration file or on the command line, and will ignore all other interfaces.

       The client normally prints no output during its startup  sequence.   It  can  be  made  to  emit  verbose
       messages  displaying  the  startup  sequence  events until it has acquired an address by supplying the <b>-v</b>
       command line argument.  In either case, the client logs messages using the <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a>(3)</b> facility.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-4</b>     Use the DHCPv4 protocol to obtain an IPv4 address  and  configuration  parameters.   This  is  the
              default and cannot be combined with <b>-6</b>.

       <b>-6</b>     Use  the  DHCPv6 protocol to obtain whatever IPv6 addresses are available along with configuration
              parameters.  It cannot be combined with <b>-4</b>.  The <b>-S</b> <b>-T</b> <b>-P</b> <b>-N</b> and <b>-D</b> arguments provide more control
              over aspects of the DHCPv6 processing.  Note: it is not recommended to mix  queries  of  different
              types together or even to share the lease file between them.

       <b>-4o6</b> <u>port</u>
              Participate  in  the  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 protocol specified by RFC 7341.  This associates a DHCPv4
              and a DHCPv6 client to allow the v4 client to send  v4  requests  encapsulated  in  a  v6  packet.
              Communication  between the two clients is done on a pair of UDP sockets bound to ::1 <u>port</u> and <u>port</u>
              <u>+</u> <u>1</u>. Both clients must be launched using the same <u>port</u> argument.

       <b>-1</b>     Try to get a lease once.  On failure exit with code 2.  In DHCPv6 this sets the  maximum  duration
              of the initial exchange to <u>timeout</u> (from dhclient.conf with a default of sixty seconds).

       <b>-d</b>     Force  <b>dhclient</b>  to  run  as  a  foreground  process.   Normally  the  DHCP client will run in the
              foreground until is has configured an interface at which time it will revert  to  running  in  the
              background.   This  option  is useful when running the client under a debugger, or when running it
              out of inittab on System V systems.  This implies <b>-v</b>.

       <b>-nw</b>    Become a daemon immediately (nowait) rather than waiting until an IP address has been acquired.

       <b>-q</b>     Be quiet at startup, this is the default.

       <b>-v</b>     Enable verbose log messages.

       <b>-w</b>     Continue running even if no broadcast interfaces were found.  Normally DHCP client will exit if it
              isn't able to identify any network  interfaces  to  configure.   On  laptop  computers  and  other
              computers  with  hot-swappable  I/O  buses, it is possible that a broadcast interface may be added
              after system startup.  This flag can be used to cause the client not to exit when it doesn't  find
              any  such interfaces.  The <b><a href="../man1/omshell.1.html">omshell</a>(1)</b> program can then be used to notify the client when a network
              interface has been added or removed, so that the client can attempt to configure an IP address  on
              that interface.

       <b>-n</b>     Do  not  configure  any  interfaces.   This is most likely to be useful in combination with the <b>-w</b>
              flag.

       <b>-e</b> <u>VAR=value</u>
              Define additional environment variables for the environment where <b>dhclient-script</b>  executes.   You
              may specify multiple <b>-e</b> options on the command line.

       <b>-r</b>     Release the current lease and stop the running DHCP client as previously recorded in the PID file.
              When  shutdown  via  this  method  <b>dhclient-script</b>  will  be executed with the specific reason for
              calling the script set.  The client normally doesn't release the current  lease  as  this  is  not
              required  by  the  DHCP protocol but some cable ISPs require their clients to notify the server if
              they wish to release an assigned IP address.

       <b>-x</b>     Stop the running DHCP client without releasing the current lease.  Kills existing <b>dhclient</b> process
              as previously recorded in the PID file.  When shutdown via this  method  <b>dhclient-script</b>  will  be
              executed with the specific reason for calling the script set.

       <b>-p</b> <u>port-number</u>
              The UDP port number on which the DHCP client should listen and transmit.  If unspecified, <b>dhclient</b>
              uses  the  default port of 68.  This is mostly useful for debugging purposes.  If a different port
              is specified on which the client should listen and transmit, the client will also use a  different
              destination port - one less than the specified port.

       <b>-s</b> <u>server-addr</u>
              Specify  the  server  IP  address  or fully qualified domain name to use as a destination for DHCP
              protocol messages before <b>dhclient</b> has acquired an IP address.  Normally, <b>dhclient</b> transmits  these
              messages  to 255.255.255.255 (the IP limited broadcast address).  Overriding this is mostly useful
              for debugging purposes.  This feature is not supported in DHCPv6 (<b>-6</b>) mode.

       <b>-g</b> <u>relay</u>
              Set the giaddr field of all packets to the <u>relay</u> IP address simulating a relay agent.  This is for
              testing purposes only and should not be expected to work in any consistent or useful way.

       <b>-i</b>     Use a DUID with DHCPv4 clients.  If no DUID is available in the lease file one will be constructed
              and saved.  The DUID will be used to construct a RFC4361 style client id that will be included  in
              the  client's  messages.   This  client  id  can  be  overridden  by  setting  a  client id in the
              configuration file.  Overriding the client id in this fashion is discouraged.

       <b>-I</b>     Use the standard DDNS scheme from RFCs 4701 &amp; 4702.

       <b>--decline-wait-time</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Specify the time (in seconds) that an IPv4 client should wait after declining  an  address  before
              issuing a discover.  The default is 10 seconds as recommended by RFC 2131, Section 3.1.5.  A value
              of zero equates to no wait at all.

       <b>--version</b> Print version number and exit.

       <u>Options</u> <u>available</u> <u>for</u> <u>DHCPv6</u> <u>mode:</u>

       <b>-S</b>     Use  Information-request  to  get only stateless configuration parameters (i.e., without address).
              This implies <b>-6</b>.  It also doesn't rewrite the lease database.

       <b>-T</b>     Ask for IPv6 temporary addresses, one set per <b>-T</b> flag.  This implies  <b>-6</b>  and  also  disables  the
              normal address query.  See <b>-N</b> to restore it.

       <b>-P</b>     Enable  IPv6  prefix delegation.  This implies <b>-6</b> and also disables the normal address query.  See
              <b>-N</b> to restore it.  Multiple prefixes can be requested with  multiple  <b>-P</b>  flags.   Note  only  one
              requested interface is allowed.

       <b>-R</b>     Require  that responses include all of the items requested by any <b>-N</b>, <b>-T</b>, or <b>-P</b> options.  Normally
              even if the command line includes a number of these the client will be willing to accept the  best
              lease it can even if the lease doesn't include all of the requested items.  This option causes the
              client to only accept leases that include all of the requested items.

              Note  well:  enabling this may prevent the client from using any leases it receives if the servers
              aren't configured to supply all of the items.

       <b>-D</b> <u>LL</u> <u>or</u> <u>LLT</u>
              Override the default when selecting the type of DUID to use.  By default, DHCPv6 <b>dhclient</b>  creates
              an  identifier  based on the link-layer address (DUID-LL) if it is running in stateless mode (with
              <b>-S</b>, not requesting an address), or it creates an identifier based on the link-layer address plus a
              timestamp (DUID-LLT) if it is running in stateful mode (without <b>-S</b>, requesting an address).   When
              DHCPv4 is configured to use a DUID using <b>-i</b> option the default is to use a DUID-LLT.  <b>-D</b> overrides
              these default, with a value of either <u>LL</u> or <u>LLT</u>.

       <b>-N</b>     Restore  normal  address  query for IPv6. This implies <b>-6</b>.  It is used to restore normal operation
              after using <b>-T</b> or <b>-P</b>.  Multiple addresses can be requested with multiple <b>-N</b> flags.

       <b>--address-prefix-len</b> <u>length</u>
              Specify the length of the prefix for IPv6 addresses. This value is passed  by  dhclient  into  the
              client  script  via  the  environment  variable,  ip6_prefixlen, when binding IPv6 addresses.  The
              default value is 128.  Alternatively you may  change  the  default  at  compile  time  by  setting
              DHCLIENT_DEFAULT_PREFIX_LEN in includes/site.h.

       <b>--dad-wait-time</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Specify  maximum time (in seconds) that the client should wait for the duplicate address detection
              (DAD) to complete on an  interface.  This  value  is  propagated  to  the  dhclient  script  in  a
              dad_wait_time  environment  variable.  If any of the IPv6 addresses on the interface are tentative
              (DAD is in progress), the script will wait  for  the  specified  number  of  seconds  for  DAD  to
              complete. If the script ignores this variable the parameter has no effect.

       <b>--prefix-len-hint</b> <u>length</u>
              When  used  in  conjunction with -P, it directs the client to use the given length to use a prefix
              hint of, "::/length", when requesting new prefixes.

       <u>Modifying</u> <u>default</u> <u>file</u> <u>locations:</u> The following options can be used to modify the locations a client uses
       for its files.  They can be particularly useful if, for example, <b>/var/lib/dhcp</b> or <b><a href="file:/var/run">/var/run</a></b> have not  been
       mounted when the DHCP client is started.

       <b>-cf</b> <u>config-file</u>
              Path  to  the  client  configuration file.  If unspecified, the default <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf</b> is
              used.  See <b><a href="../man5/dhclient.conf.5.html">dhclient.conf</a>(5)</b> for a description of this file.

       <b>-df</b> <u>duid-lease-file</u>
              Path to a secondary lease file.  If the primary lease file doesn't contain a DUID this  file  will
              be searched.  The DUID read from the secondary will be written to the primary.  This option can be
              used  to  allow  an  IPv4  instance  of  the  client to share a DUID with an IPv6 instance.  After
              starting one of the instances the second can be started with this option  pointing  to  the  lease
              file of the first instance.  There is no default.  If no file is specified no search is made for a
              DUID should one not be found in the main lease file.

       <b>-lf</b> <u>lease-file</u>
              Path  to  the  lease  database file.  If unspecified, the default <b>/var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.leases</b> is
              used.  See <b><a href="../man5/dhclient.leases.5.html">dhclient.leases</a>(5)</b> for a description of this file.

       <b>-pf</b> <u>pid-file</u>
              Path to the process ID file.  If unspecified, the default <b>/var/run/dhclient.pid</b> is used.

       <b>--no-pid</b>
              Option to disable writing pid files.  By default the program  will  write  a  pid  file.   If  the
              program is invoked with this option it will not attempt to kill any existing client processes even
              if invoked with <b>-r</b> or <b>-x</b>.

       <b>-sf</b> <u>script-file</u>
              Path  to  the  network  configuration  script  invoked  by  <b>dhclient</b>  when  it  gets  a lease.  If
              unspecified, the default <b>/sbin/dhclient-script</b> is used.  See <b><a href="../man8/dhclient-script.8.html">dhclient-script</a>(8)</b> for a  description
              of this file.

</pre><h4><b>PORTS</b></h4><pre>
       During  operations the client may use multiple UDP ports to provide different functions.  Which ports are
       opened depends on both the way you compiled your code and the configuration you  supply.   The  following
       should provide you an idea of what ports may be in use.

       Normally  a  DHCPv4  client  will open a raw UDP socket to receive and send most DHCPv4 packets.  It also
       opens a fallback UDP socket for use in sending unicast packets.  Normally these will both  use  the  well
       known port number for BOOTPC.

       For  DHCPv6  the  client  opens a UDP socket on the well known client port and a fallback UDP socket on a
       random port for use in sending unicast messages.  Unlike DHCPv4 the well known socket doesn't need to  be
       opened in raw mode.

       If  you  have included an omapi port statement in your configuration file then the client will open a TCP
       socket on that port to listen for OMPAI connections.  When something connects another port will  be  used
       for the established connection.

       When  DDNS  is  enabled at compile time (see includes/site.h) the client will open both a v4 and a v6 UDP
       socket on random ports.  These ports are not opened unless/until the  client  first  attempts  to  do  an
       update.  If the client is not configured to do updates, the ports will never be opened.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The syntax of the <b><a href="../man5/dhclient.conf.5.html">dhclient.conf</a>(5)</b> file is discussed separately.

</pre><h4><b>OMAPI</b></h4><pre>
       The  DHCP  client  provides  some  ability  to control it while it is running, without stopping it.  This
       capability is provided using OMAPI, an API for manipulating remote objects.  OMAPI clients connect to the
       client using TCP/IP, authenticate, and can then examine the client's current status and make  changes  to
       it.

       Rather than implementing the underlying OMAPI protocol directly, user programs should use the dhcpctl API
       or  OMAPI  itself.  Dhcpctl is a wrapper that handles some of the housekeeping chores that OMAPI does not
       do automatically.  Dhcpctl and OMAPI are documented in <b><a href="../man3/dhcpctl.3.html">dhcpctl</a>(3)</b> and <b><a href="../man3/omapi.3.html">omapi</a>(3)</b>.  Most things  you'd  want
       to  do  with  the client can be done directly using the <b><a href="../man1/omshell.1.html">omshell</a>(1)</b> command, rather than having to write a
       special program.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>OBJECT</b></h4><pre>
       The control object allows you to shut the client down, releasing all leases that it  holds  and  deleting
       any  DNS  records  it  may  have  added.   It also allows you to pause the client - this unconfigures any
       interfaces the client is using.   You  can  then  restart  it,  which  causes  it  to  reconfigure  those
       interfaces.   You  would  normally  pause the client prior to going into hibernation or sleep on a laptop
       computer.  You would then resume it after the power comes back.  This allows PC cards  to  be  shut  down
       while  the  computer  is hibernating or sleeping, and then reinitialized to their previous state once the
       computer comes out of hibernation or sleep.

       The control object has one attribute - the state attribute.  To shut  the  client  down,  set  its  state
       attribute  to 2.  It will automatically do a DHCPRELEASE.  To pause it, set its state attribute to 3.  To
       resume it, set its state attribute to 4.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables may be defined to override the builtin defaults for  file  locations.
       Note  that  use  of  the  related command-line options will ignore the corresponding environment variable
       settings.

       <b>PATH_DHCLIENT_CONF</b>
              The dhclient.conf configuration file.

       <b>PATH_DHCLIENT_DB</b>
              The dhclient.leases database.

       <b>PATH_DHCLIENT_PID</b>
              The dhclient PID file.

       <b>PATH_DHCLIENT_SCRIPT</b>
              The dhclient-script file.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/sbin/dhclient-script,</b>  <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf,</b>  <b>/var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.leases,</b>   <b>/var/run/dhclient.pid,</b>

       This client was substantially modified and enhanced by Elliot Poger for use on Linux while he was working
       on the MosquitoNet project at Stanford.

       The  current  version  owes  much  to  Elliot's Linux enhancements, but was substantially reorganized and
       partially rewritten by Ted Lemon so as to use the same networking framework  that  the  Internet  Systems
       Consortium  DHCP  server  uses.  Much system-specific configuration code was moved into a shell script so
       that as support for more operating systems is added, it will  not  be  necessary  to  port  and  maintain
       system-specific  configuration code to these operating systems - instead, the shell script can invoke the
       native tools to accomplish the same purpose.

                                                                                                     <u><a href="../man8/dhclient.8.html">dhclient</a></u>(8)
