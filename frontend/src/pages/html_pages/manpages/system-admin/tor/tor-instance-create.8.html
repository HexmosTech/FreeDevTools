</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tor-instance-create - Set up a new tor instance

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tor-instance-create</b> <u>instance_name</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Tor Debian package supports running multiple instances of the Tor daemon. This can be useful if you
       want to run multiple relays or bridge relays on a single system, of if you want to provide a hidden
       service in addition to running a relay.

       <b>tor-instance-create</b> is the tool that creates a new instance of Tor on a Debian system. In particular, it
       creates a new UNIX user with a home directory and a mostly empty tor configuration file.

       The new user and group are named <b>_tor-</b><u>instance_name</u>. The userâ€™s home directory, which is also the
       DataDirectory of the new tor instance, is <b>/var/lib/tor-instances/</b><u>instance_name</u>. The configuration file
       for that instance is <b>/etc/tor/instances/</b><u>instance_name</u><b>/torrc</b>. Logs go to syslog by default.

       To start this new service, use <b>systemctl</b> <b>start</b> <b>tor@</b><u>instance_name</u>. Stopping, restarting, and reloading the
       config works accordingly. Stopping/Starting/.. the <b>tor</b> service should affect all instances. The "main"
       instance which lives in /var/lib/tor and has /etc/tor/torrc as its configuration file is known to systemd
       as <b>tor@default</b>.

       There currently is no <b>tor-instance-remove</b> script. To remove an instance, delete the user and its
       homedirectory once you are convinced there are no files or processes on your system still owned by that
       user. Then also remove the corresponding directory tree in /etc/tor/instances.
