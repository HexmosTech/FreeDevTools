</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wallet-admin - Wallet server administrative commands

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wallet-admin</b> <u>command</u> [<u>args</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wallet-admin</b> provides a command-line interface for performing administrative actions for the wallet
       system, such as setting up a new database or running reports.  It is intended to be run on the wallet
       server as a user with access to the wallet database and configuration.

       This program is a fairly thin wrapper around Wallet::Admin that translates command strings into method
       calls and returns the results.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wallet-admin</b> takes no traditional options.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       destroy
           Deletes  all  data  in  the wallet database and drops all of the wallet-created tables, restoring the
           database to its state prior to an "initialize" command.  Since this command is destructive and cannot
           be easily recovered from, <b>wallet-admin</b> will prompt first to be sure the user intends to do this.

       initialize &lt;principal&gt;
           Given an empty database, initializes it for use with the wallet  server  by  creating  the  necessary
           tables  and  initial  metadata.   Also  creates  an  ACL with the name ADMIN, used for administrative
           privileges to the wallet system, and adds an ACL entry to it with a scheme of "krb5" and an  instance
           of  &lt;principal&gt;.   This  bootstraps  the  authentication  system and allows that user to make further
           changes to the ADMIN ACL and the rest of the wallet database.  "initialize" uses "localhost"  as  the
           hostname  and  &lt;principal&gt; as the user when logging the history of the ADMIN ACL creation and for any
           subsequent actions required to initialize the database.

           Before running "initialize", the wallet system has to be configured.  See <b>Wallet::<a href="../man3/Config.3.html">Config</a></b>(3) for  more
           details.   Depending  on  the  database  backend  used,  the  database may also have to be created in
           advance.

       register (object | verifier) &lt;type&gt; &lt;class&gt;
           Registers an implementation of a wallet object or ACL verifier in  the  wallet  database.   The  Perl
           class  &lt;class&gt;  is registered as the implementation of an object of type &lt;type&gt; or an ACL verifier of
           scheme &lt;type&gt;, allowing creation of objects with that type or ACL lines with that scheme.

           All object and ACL implementations that come with  wallet  are  registered  by  default  as  part  of
           database  initialization,  so  this  command  is  used primarily to register local implementations of
           additional object types or ACL schemes.

       upgrade
           Upgrades the database to the latest schema version, preserving data as much as possible.
