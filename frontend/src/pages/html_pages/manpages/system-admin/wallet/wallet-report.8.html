</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wallet-report - Wallet server reporting interface

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wallet-report</b> <u>type</u> [<u>args</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wallet-report</b> provides a command-line interface for running reports on the wallet database.  It is
       intended to be run on the wallet server as a user with access to the wallet database and configuration,
       but can also be made available via remctl to users who should have reporting privileges.

       This program is a fairly thin wrapper around Wallet::Report that translates command strings into method
       calls and returns the results.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wallet-report</b> takes no traditional options.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       acls
       acls duplicate
       acls empty
       acls entry &lt;scheme&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
       acls unused
           Returns  a  list  of ACLs in the database.  Except for the "duplicate" report, ACLs will be listed in
           the form:

               &lt;name&gt; (ACL ID: &lt;id&gt;)

           where &lt;name&gt; is the human-readable name and &lt;id&gt; is the numeric ID.  The numeric ID  is  what's  used
           internally by the wallet system.  There will be one line per ACL.

           For  the  "duplicate"  report, the output will instead be one duplicate set per line.  This will be a
           set of ACLs that all have the same entries.  Only the names will be given, separated by spaces.

           If no search type is given, all the ACLs in the database will be returned.  If  a  search  type  (and
           possible search arguments) are given, then the ACLs will be limited to those that match the search.

           The currently supported ACL search types are:

           acls duplicate
               Returns all sets of ACLs that are duplicates, meaning that they contain exactly the same entries.
               Each line will be the names of the ACLs in a set of duplicates, separated by spaces.

           acls empty
               Returns all ACLs which have no entries, generally so that abandoned ACLs can be destroyed.

           acls entry &lt;scheme&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
               Returns  all  ACLs  containing  an entry with given scheme and identifier.  The scheme must be an
               exact match, but the &lt;identifier&gt; string will match any identifier containing that string.

           acls nested &lt;acl&gt;
               Returns all ACLs that contain this ACL as a nested entry.

           acls unused
               Returns all ACLs that are not referenced by any of the objects in the wallet database, either  as
               an owner or on one of the more specific ACLs.

       audit acls name
       audit objects name
           Returns  all  ACLs or objects that violate the current site naming policy.  Objects will be listed in
           the form:

               &lt;type&gt; &lt;name&gt;

           and ACLs in the form:

               &lt;name&gt; (ACL ID: &lt;id&gt;)

           where &lt;name&gt; is the human-readable name and &lt;id&gt; is the numeric ID.  The numeric ID  is  what's  used
           internally by the wallet system.  There will be one line per object or ACL.

       help
           Displays a summary of all available commands.

       objects
       objects acl &lt;acl&gt;
       objects flag &lt;flag&gt;
       objects owner &lt;owner&gt;
       objects type &lt;type&gt;
       objects unused
       objects unstored
           Returns a list of objects in the database.  Objects will be listed in the form:

               &lt;type&gt; &lt;name&gt;

           There will be one line per object.

           If  no  search  type  is  given, all objects in the database will be returned.  If a search type (and
           possible search arguments) are given, the objects will be limited to those that match the search.

           The currently supported object search types are:

           objects acl &lt;acl&gt;
               Returns all objects for which the given ACL name or ID has any permissions.  This includes  those
               objects owned by the ACL as well as those where that ACL has any other, more limited permissions.

           objects flag &lt;flag&gt;
               Returns all objects which have the given flag set.

           objects host &lt;hostname&gt;
               Returns  all  objects that belong to the given host.  This requires adding local configuration to
               identify objects that belong to a given host.  See "OBJECT HOST-BASED  NAMES"  in  Wallet::Config
               for more information.

           objects owner &lt;acl&gt;
               Returns all objects owned by the given ACL name or ID.

           objects type &lt;type&gt;
               Returns all objects of the given type.

           objects unused
               Returns  all  objects  that  have  never  been  downloaded  (have  never been the target of a get
               command).

       owners &lt;type-pattern&gt; &lt;name-pattern&gt;
           Returns a list of all ACL entries in owner ACLs for all  objects  matching  both  &lt;type-pattern&gt;  and
           &lt;name-pattern&gt;.   These  can  be the type or name of objects or they can be patterns using "%" as the
           wildcard character following the normal rules of SQL patterns.

           The output will be one line per ACL line in the form:

               &lt;scheme&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;

           with duplicates suppressed.

       schemes
           Returns a list of all registered ACL schemes.

       types
           Returns a list of all registered object types.
