</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gdisk - Interactive GUID partition table (GPT) manipulator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gdisk</b> [ -l ] <u>device</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       GPT  fdisk  (aka  <b>gdisk</b>)  is  a  text-mode menu-driven program for creation and manipulation of partition
       tables. It will automatically convert an old-style Master  Boot  Record  (MBR)  partition  table  or  BSD
       disklabel  stored  without  an  MBR  carrier  partition  to  the  newer Globally Unique Identifier (GUID)
       Partition Table (GPT) format, or will load a GUID partition table. When used  with  the  <u>-l</u>  command-line
       option, the program displays the current partition table and then exits.

       GPT  fdisk  operates  mainly on the GPT headers and partition tables; however, it can and will generate a
       fresh protective MBR, when required. (Any boot loader code in the protective MBR will not be  disturbed.)
       If  you've  created  an  unusual  protective  MBR, such as a hybrid MBR created by <b>gptsync</b> or <b>gdisk</b>'s own
       hybrid MBR creation feature, this should not be disturbed by most ordinary actions.  Some  advanced  data
       recovery  options require you to understand the distinctions between the main and backup data, as well as
       between the GPT headers and the partition tables. For  information  on  MBR  vs.  GPT,  as  well  as  GPT
       terminology  and  structure,  see the extended <b>gdisk</b> documentation at <u>https://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/</u> or
       consult Wikipedia.

       The <b>gdisk</b> program employs a user interface similar to that of  Linux's  <b>fdisk</b>,  but  <b>gdisk</b>  modifies  GPT
       partitions.  It  also  has  the  capability  of  transforming  MBR  partitions or BSD disklabels into GPT
       partitions. Like the original <b>fdisk</b> program, <b>gdisk</b> does not modify disk structures until  you  explicitly
       write  them to disk, so if you make a mistake, you can exit from the program with the 'q' option to leave
       your partitions unmodified.

       Ordinarily, <b>gdisk</b> operates on disk device files, such as <u>/dev/sda</u> or  <u>/dev/hda</u>  under  Linux,  <u>/dev/disk0</u>
       under  Mac OS X, or <u>/dev/ad0</u> or <u>/dev/da0</u> under FreeBSD. The program can also operate on disk image files,
       which can be either copies of whole disks (made with <b>dd</b>,  for  instance)  or  raw  disk  images  used  by
       emulators  such  as  QEMU  or  VMWare. Note that only <u>raw</u> disk images are supported; <b>gdisk</b> cannot work on
       compressed or other advanced disk image formats.

       The MBR partitioning system uses a combination of cylinder/head/sector (CHS) addressing and logical block
       addressing (LBA). The former is klunky and limiting. GPT drops CHS addressing and uses  64-bit  LBA  mode
       exclusively.  Thus, GPT data structures, and therefore <b>gdisk</b>, do not need to deal with CHS geometries and
       all the problems they create. Users of <b>fdisk</b> will note that  <b>gdisk</b>  lacks  the  options  and  limitations
       associated with CHS geometries.

       For  best  results, you should use an OS-specific partition table program whenever possible. For example,
       you should make Mac OS X partitions with the Mac OS X Disk Utility program and Linux partitions with  the
       Linux <b>gdisk</b> or GNU Parted program.

       Upon start, <b>gdisk</b> attempts to identify the partition type in use on the disk. If it finds valid GPT data,
       <b>gdisk</b>  will  use  it.  If  <b>gdisk</b>  finds  a valid MBR or BSD disklabel but no GPT data, it will attempt to
       convert the MBR or disklabel into GPT form. (BSD disklabels are likely  to  have  unusable  first  and/or
       final  partitions because they overlap with the GPT data structures, though.) GPT fdisk can identify, but
       not use data in, Apple Partition Map (APM) disks, which are used on 680x0- and PowerPC-based Macintoshes.
       Upon exiting with the 'w' option, <b>gdisk</b> replaces the  MBR  or  disklabel  with  a  GPT.  <u>This</u>  <u>action</u>  <u>is</u>
       <u>potentially</u>  <u>dangerous!</u>  Your system may become unbootable, and partition type codes may become corrupted
       if the disk uses unrecognized type codes. Boot problems are particularly likely if  you're  multi-booting
       with  any  GPT-unaware OS. If you mistakenly launch <b>gdisk</b> on an MBR disk, you can safely exit the program
       without making any changes by using the 'q' option.

       The MBR-to-GPT conversion will leave at least one gap in the partition numbering if the original MBR used
       logical partitions. These gaps are harmless, but you can eliminate them by using the 's' option,  if  you
       like.  (Doing this may require you to update your <u><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></u> file.)

       When creating a fresh partition table, certain considerations may be in order:

       <b>*</b>      For  data  (non-boot) disks, and for boot disks used on BIOS-based computers with GRUB as the boot
              loader, partitions may be created in whatever order and in whatever sizes are desired.

       <b>*</b>      Boot disks for EFI-based systems require an <u>EFI</u> <u>System</u>  <u>Partition</u>  (<b>gdisk</b>  internal  code  0xEF00)
              formatted  as  FAT-32.  I recommended making this partition 550 MiB. (Smaller ESPs are common, but
              some EFIs have flaky FAT drivers that necessitate a  larger  partition  for  reliable  operation.)
              Boot-related files are stored here. (Note that GNU Parted identifies such partitions as having the
              "boot flag" set.)

       <b>*</b>      Some  boot  loaders  for BIOS-based systems make use of a <u>BIOS</u> <u>Boot</u> <u>Partition</u> (<b>gdisk</b> internal code
              0xEF02), in which the secondary  boot  loader  is  stored,  possibly  without  the  benefit  of  a
              filesystem.  (GRUB2  may  optionally  use such a partition.) This partition can typically be quite
              small (roughly 32 to 200 KiB, although 1 MiB is more common in practice), but you  should  consult
              your boot loader documentation for details.

       <b>*</b>      If Windows is to boot from a GPT disk, a partition of type <u>Microsoft</u> <u>Reserved</u> (<b>gdisk</b> internal code
              0x0C01)  is recommended. This partition should be about 128 MiB in size. It ordinarily follows the
              EFI System Partition and immediately precedes the Windows data partitions. (Note that old versions
              of GNU Parted create all FAT partitions as this type, which actually makes the partition  unusable
              for normal file storage in both Windows and Mac OS X.)

       <b>*</b>      Some  OSes'  GPT  utilities  create some blank space (typically 128 MiB) after each partition. The
              intent is to enable future disk utilities to use this space. Such free space is  not  required  of
              GPT  disks,  but creating it may help in future disk maintenance. You can use GPT fdisk's relative
              partition positioning option (specifying the starting sector as '+128M', for instance) to simplify
              creating such gaps.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-l</b>     List the partition table for the specified device and then exits.

       Most interactions with <b>gdisk</b> occur with its interactive text-mode menus.  Three  menus  exist:  the  main
       menu,  the  recovery  &amp;  transformation menu, and the experts' menu. The main menu provides the functions
       that are most likely to be  useful  for  typical  partitioning  tasks,  such  as  creating  and  deleting
       partitions, changing partition type codes, and so on. Specific functions are:

       <b>b</b>      Save  partition data to a backup file. You can back up your current in-memory partition table to a
              disk file using this option. The resulting file is a binary file consisting of the protective MBR,
              the main GPT header, the backup GPT header, and one copy of the partition table,  in  that  order.
              Note  that  the  backup is of the current in-memory data structures, so if you launch the program,
              make changes, and then use this option, the backup will reflect your changes. Note also  that  the
              restore  option is on the recovery &amp; transformation menu; the backup option is on the main menu to
              encourage its use.

       <b>c</b>      Change the GPT name of a partition. This name is encoded as a UTF-16 string, but proper entry  and
              display  of  anything beyond basic ASCII values requires suitable locale and font support. For the
              most part, Linux ignores the partition name, but it may be important in some OSes. GPT fdisk  sets
              a  default  name  based  on the partition type code. Note that the GPT partition name is different
              from the filesystem name, which is encoded in the filesystem's data structures.

       <b>d</b>      Delete a partition. This action deletes the entry from the partition table but  does  not  disturb
              the  data within the sectors originally allocated to the partition on the disk. If a corresponding
              hybrid MBR partition exists, <b>gdisk</b> deletes it, as well, and expands any adjacent  0xEE  (EFI  GPT)
              MBR protective partition to fill the new free space.

       <b>i</b>      Show  detailed  partition  information.  The  summary  information  produced  by  the  'p' command
              necessarily omits many details, such as the partition's unique GUID and the translation of <b>gdisk</b>'s
              internal partition type code to a plain type name. The 'i' option displays this information for  a
              single partition.

       <b>l</b>      Display  a  summary of partition types. GPT uses a GUID to identify partition types for particular
              OSes and purposes. For ease of data  entry,  <b>gdisk</b>  compresses  these  into  two-byte  (four-digit
              hexadecimal)  values that are related to their equivalent MBR codes. Specifically, the MBR code is
              multiplied by hexadecimal 0x0100. For instance, the code for Linux swap space in MBR is 0x82,  and
              it's  0x8200  in <b>gdisk</b>. A one-to-one correspondence is impossible, though. Most notably, the codes
              for all varieties of FAT and NTFS partition correspond to a single GPT code (entered as 0x0700  in
              <b>gdisk</b>).  Some  OSes use a single MBR code but employ many more codes in GPT. For these, <b>gdisk</b> adds
              code numbers sequentially, such as 0xa500 for a FreeBSD disklabel, 0xa501 for FreeBSD boot, 0xa502
              for FreeBSD swap, and so on. Note that these two-byte codes are unique to  <b>gdisk</b>.  The  type  code
              list  may  optionally  be  filtered  by  a  search string; for instance, entering <b>linux</b> shows only
              partition type codes with descriptions that include the string <u>Linux</u>.  This  search  is  performed
              case-insensitively.

       <b>n</b>      Create  a  new partition. This command is modeled after the equivalent <b>fdisk</b> option, although some
              differences exist. You enter a partition number, starting sector, and an ending sector. Both start
              and end sectors can be specified in absolute terms as sector numbers or as positions  measured  in
              kibibytes  (K),  mebibytes  (M), gibibytes (G), tebibytes (T), or pebibytes (P); for instance, <b>40M</b>
              specifies a position 40MiB from the start of the disk. You can specify locations relative  to  the
              start  or end of the specified default range by preceding the number by a '+' or '-' symbol, as in
              <b>+2G</b> to specify a point 2GiB after the default start sector, or <b>-200M</b> to  specify  a  point  200MiB
              before  the  last  available  sector.  Pressing  the Enter key with no input specifies the default
              value, which is the start of the largest available block for the start sector and the end  of  the
              same  block for the end sector. Default start and end points may be adjusted to optimize partition
              alignment.

       <b>o</b>      Clear out all partition data. This includes GPT header data, all partition  definitions,  and  the
              protective  MBR.  The  sector  alignment is reset to the default (1 MiB, or 2048 sectors on a disk
              with 512-byte sectors).

       <b>p</b>      Display basic partition summary data. This includes partition numbers, starting and ending  sector
              numbers,  partition  sizes,  <b>gdisk</b>'s  partition  types  codes, and partition names. For additional
              information, use the 'i' command.

       <b>q</b>      Quit from the program <u>without</u> <u>saving</u> <u>your</u> <u>changes</u>.  Use this option if you  just  wanted  to  view
              information or if you make a mistake and want to back out of all your changes.

       <b>r</b>      Enter  the  recovery  &amp; transformation menu. This menu includes emergency recovery options (to fix
              damaged GPT data structures) and options to transform  to  or  from  other  partitioning  systems,
              including creating hybrid MBRs.

       <b>s</b>      Sort  partition entries. GPT partition numbers need not match the order of partitions on the disk.
              If you want them to match, you can use this option.  Note that some  partitioning  utilities  sort
              partitions whenever they make changes. Such changes will be reflected in your device filenames, so
              you may need to edit <u><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></u> if you use this option.

       <b>t</b>      Change  a  single  partition's  type  code.  You  enter the type code using a two-byte hexadecimal
              number, as described earlier. You may also enter a GUID  directly,  if  you  have  one  and  <b>gdisk</b>
              doesn't know it.

       <b>v</b>      Verify  disk.  This option checks for a variety of problems, such as incorrect CRCs and mismatched
              main and backup data. This option does not automatically correct most problems, though; for  that,
              you must use options on the recovery &amp; transformation menu. If no problems are found, this command
              displays a summary of unallocated disk space.

       <b>w</b>      Write data. Use this command to save your changes.

       <b>x</b>      Enter  the  experts'  menu.  Using this option provides access to features you can use to get into
              even more trouble than the main menu allows.

       <b>?</b>      Print the menu. Type this command (or  any  other  unrecognized  command)  to  see  a  summary  of
              available options.

       The  second  <b>gdisk</b>  menu  is  the  recovery &amp; transformation menu, which provides access to data recovery
       options and features related to the transformation of partitions between partitioning schemes (converting
       BSD disklabels into GPT partitions or creating hybrid MBRs, for instance).  A few options  on  this  menu
       duplicate functionality on the main menu, for the sake of convenience. The options on this menu are:

       <b>b</b>      Rebuild  GPT  header from backup. You can use the backup GPT header to rebuild the main GPT header
              with this option. It's likely to be useful if your main GPT header was damaged or destroyed  (say,
              by sloppy use of <b>dd</b>).

       <b>c</b>      Load  backup  partition  table. Ordinarily, <b>gdisk</b> uses only the main partition table (although the
              backup's integrity is checked when you launch the program). If the main partition table  has  been
              damaged,  you  can use this option to load the backup from disk and use it instead. Note that this
              will almost certainly produce no or strange partition entries if you've just converted an MBR disk
              to GPT format, since there will be no backup partition table on disk.

       <b>d</b>      Use main GPT header and rebuild the backup. This option is likely to be useful if the  backup  GPT
              header has been damaged or destroyed.

       <b>e</b>      Load  main  partition  table.  This  option  reloads the main partition table from disk. It's only
              likely to be useful if you've tried to use the backup partition table (via 'c') but it's in  worse
              shape then the main partition table.

       <b>f</b>      Load MBR and build fresh GPT from it. Use this option if your GPT is corrupt or conflicts with the
              MBR and you want to use the MBR as the basis for a new set of GPT partitions.

       <b>g</b>      Convert  GPT into MBR and exit. This option converts as many partitions as possible into MBR form,
              destroys the GPT data structures, saves the new MBR, and exits.  Use this option if  you've  tried
              GPT  and find that MBR works better for you.  Note that this function generates up to four primary
              MBR partitions or three primary partitions and as many logical partitions  as  can  be  generated.
              Each logical partition requires at least one unallocated block immediately before its first block.
              Therefore, it may be possible to convert a maximum of four partitions on disks with tightly-packed
              partitions;  however, if free space was inserted between partitions when they were created, and if
              the disk is under 2 TiB in size, it should be possible to convert all the partitions to MBR  form.
              See also the 'h' option.

       <b>h</b>      Create a hybrid MBR. This is an ugly workaround that enables GPT-unaware OSes, or those that can't
              boot  from a GPT disk, to access up to three of the partitions on the disk by creating MBR entries
              for them. Note that these hybrid MBR entries can easily go out  of  sync  with  the  GPT  entries,
              particularly  when  hybrid-unaware GPT utilities are used to edit the disk.  Thus, you may need to
              re-create the hybrid MBR if you use such tools. Unlike  the  'g'  option,  this  option  does  not
              support converting any partitions into MBR logical partitions.

       <b>i</b>      Show detailed partition information. This option is identical to the 'i' option on the main menu.

       <b>l</b>      Load  partition  data from a backup file. This option is the reverse of the 'b' option on the main
              menu. Note that restoring partition data from anything but the original disk is not recommended.

       <b>m</b>      Return to the main menu. This option enables you to enter main-menu commands.

       <b>o</b>      Print protective MBR data. You can see a summary of the  protective  MBR's  partitions  with  this
              option.  This  may enable you to spot glaring problems or help identify the partitions in a hybrid
              MBR.

       <b>p</b>      Print the partition table. This option is identical to the 'p' option in the main menu.

       <b>q</b>      Quit without saving changes. This option is identical to the 'q' option in the main menu.

       <b>t</b>      Transform BSD partitions into GPT partitions. This option works on BSD disklabels held within  GPT
              (or  converted  MBR)  partitions.  Converted  partitions'  type  codes  are  likely to need manual
              adjustment. <b>gdisk</b> will attempt to convert BSD disklabels stored on the main  disk  when  launched,
              but  this conversion is likely to produce first and/or last partitions that are unusable. The many
              BSD variants means that the probability of <b>gdisk</b> being unable to convert a BSD disklabel  is  high
              compared to the likelihood of problems with an MBR conversion.

       <b>v</b>      Verify disk. This option is identical to the 'v' option in the main menu.

       <b>w</b>      Write table to disk and exit. This option is identical to the 'w' option in the main menu.

       <b>x</b>      Enter the experts' menu. This option is identical to the 'x' option in the main menu.

       <b>?</b>      Print the menu. This option (or any unrecognized entry) displays a summary of the menu options.

       The  third  <b>gdisk</b>  menu  is  the  experts'  menu. This menu provides advanced options that aren't closely
       related to recovery or transformation between partitioning systems. Its options are:

       <b>a</b>      Set attributes. GPT provides a 64-bit attributes field that can be used to set features  for  each
              partition.  <b>gdisk</b>  supports  four  attributes:  <u>system</u>  <u>partition</u>,  <u>read-only</u>,  <u>hidden</u>, and <u>do</u> <u>not</u>
              <u>automount</u>. You can set other attributes, but their numbers aren't translated into anything useful.
              In practice, most OSes seem to ignore these attributes.

       <b>b</b>      Swap the byte order for the name of the specified partition. Some  partitioning  tools,  including
              GPT  fdisk  1.0.7  and earlier, can write the partition name in the wrong byte order on big-endian
              computers, such as the IBM s390 mainframes and PowerPC-based  Macs.  This  feature  corrects  this
              problem.

       <b>c</b>      Change partition GUID. You can enter a custom unique GUID for a partition using this option. (Note
              this  refers to the GUID that uniquely identifies a partition, not to its type code, which you can
              change with the 't' main-menu option.) Ordinarily, <b>gdisk</b> assigns this  number  randomly;  however,
              you  might  want  to  adjust  the  number  manually  if  you've wound up with the same GUID on two
              partitions because of buggy  GUID  assignments  (hopefully  not  in  <b>gdisk</b>)  or  sheer  incredible
              coincidence.

       <b>d</b>      Display the sector alignment value. See the description of the 'l' option for more details.

       <b>e</b>      Move  backup GPT data structures to the end of the disk. Use this command if you've added disks to
              a RAID array, thus creating a virtual disk with space that follows the backup GPT data structures.
              This command moves the backup GPT data structures to the end of the disk, where they belong.

       <b>f</b>      Randomize the disk's GUID and all partitions' unique GUIDs (but  not  their  partition  type  code
              GUIDs). This function may be used after cloning a disk with another utility in order to render all
              GUIDs once again unique.

       <b>g</b>      Change  disk GUID. Each disk has a unique GUID code, which <b>gdisk</b> assigns randomly upon creation of
              the GPT data structures. You can generate a fresh random GUID or  enter  one  manually  with  this
              option.

       <b>h</b>      Recompute  CHS  values  in  protective  or  hybrid  MBR.  This option can sometimes help if a disk
              utility, OS, or BIOS doesn't like the CHS values used by  the  partitions  in  the  protective  or
              hybrid  MBR.  In  particular, the GPT specification requires a CHS value of 0xFFFFFF for over-8GiB
              partitions, but this value is technically illegal by the usual standards. Some BIOSes hang if they
              encounter this value. This option will recompute a more normal CHS value -- 0xFEFFFF for over-8GiB
              partitions, enabling these BIOSes to boot.

       <b>i</b>      Show detailed partition information. This option is identical to the 'i' option on the main menu.

       <b>j</b>      Adjust the location of the main partition table. This value is normally 2, but it may need  to  be
              increased  in some cases, such as when a system-on-chip (SoC) is hard-coded to read boot code from
              sector 2. I recommend against adjusting this value unless doing so is absolutely necessary.

       <b>k</b>      Adjust the location of the backup partition table. This partition table is normally  located  just
              before  the  backup metadata at the end of the disk, but it may need to be moved in some very rare
              cases. I recommend against adjusting this value unless doing so is absolutely necessary.

       <b>l</b>      Change the sector alignment value. Disks with more logical sectors per physical sectors  (such  as
              modern  Advanced  Format  drives),  some  RAID  configurations,  and  many SSD devices, can suffer
              performance problems if partitions are not aligned properly for their internal data structures. On
              new disks, GPT fdisk attempts to align partitions on 1 MiB boundaries (2048 sectors on disks  with
              512-byte  sectors)  by  default,  which  optimizes  performance  for  all  of these disk types. On
              pre-partitioned disks, GPT fdisk attempts to identify the alignment value used on that  disk,  but
              will  set  8-sector  alignment  on  disks  larger  than 300 GB even if lesser alignment values are
              detected. In either case, it can be changed by  using  this  option.   The  alignment  value  also
              affects the default end sector value when creating a new partition; it will be aligned to one less
              than a multiple of the alignment value, if possible. This should keep partitions a multiple of the
              alignment  value in size. Some disk encryption tools require partitions to be sized to some value,
              typically 4096 bytes, so the default alignment of 1 MiB works well for them.

       <b>m</b>      Return to the main menu. This option enables you to enter main-menu commands.

       <b>n</b>      Create a new protective MBR. Use this option if the current protective MBR is  damaged  in  a  way
              that <b>gdisk</b> doesn't automatically detect and correct, or if you want to convert a hybrid MBR into a
              "pure" GPT with a conventional protective MBR.

       <b>o</b>      Print  protective  MBR  data.  You  can see a summary of the protective MBR's partitions with this
              option. This may enable you to spot glaring problems or help identify the partitions in  a  hybrid
              MBR.

       <b>p</b>      Print the partition table. This option is identical to the 'p' option in the main menu.

       <b>q</b>      Quit without saving changes. This option is identical to the 'q' option in the main menu.

       <b>r</b>      Enter  the recovery &amp; transformations menu. This option is identical to the 'r' option on the main
              menu.

       <b>s</b>      Resize partition table. The default partition table size is 128  entries.   Officially,  sizes  of
              less  than  16KB  (128  entries,  given  the  normal  entry  size)  are  unsupported  by  the  GPT
              specification; however, in practice they seem to work, and can sometimes be useful  in  converting
              MBR  disks.  Larger  sizes  also  work  fine.  OSes  may  impose their own limits on the number of
              partitions, though.

       <b>t</b>      Swap two partitions' entries in the partition table. One partition may be empty. For instance,  if
              partitions  1-4  are defined, transposing 1 and 5 results in a table with partitions numbered from
              2-5. Transposing partitions in this way has no effect on their  disk  space  allocation;  it  only
              alters their order in the partition table.

       <b>u</b>      Replicate the current device's partition table on another device. You will be prompted to type the
              new  device's filename. After the write operation completes, you can continue editing the original
              device's partition table.  Note that the replicated partition table is an  exact  copy,  including
              all  GUIDs; if the device should have its own unique GUIDs, you should use the <b>f</b> option on the new
              disk.

       <b>v</b>      Verify disk. This option is identical to the 'v' option in the main menu.

       <b>z</b>      Zap (destroy) the GPT data structures and exit. Use this option if you want to repartition  a  GPT
              disk  using <b>fdisk</b> or some other GPT-unaware program.  You'll be given the choice of preserving the
              existing MBR, in case it's a hybrid MBR with salvageable partitions or if you've  already  created
              new  MBR  partitions  and  want  to  erase  the remnants of your GPT partitions. <u>If</u> <u>you've</u> <u>already</u>
              <u>created</u> <u>new</u> <u>MBR</u> <u>partitions,</u> <u>it's</u> <u>conceivable</u> <u>that</u> <u>this</u> <u>option</u> <u>will</u> <u>damage</u> <u>the</u>  <u>first</u>  <u>and/or</u>  <u>last</u>
              <u>MBR</u>  <u>partitions!</u> Such an event is unlikely, but could occur if your new MBR partitions overlap the
              old GPT data structures.

       <b>?</b>      Print the menu. This option (or any unrecognized entry) displays a summary of the menu options.

       In many cases, you can press the Enter key to select a default option when entering data. When  only  one
       option is possible, <b>gdisk</b> usually bypasses the prompt entirely.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Known bugs and limitations include:

       <b>*</b>      The  program compiles correctly only on Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Windows.  Linux versions for
              x86-64 (64-bit), x86 (32-bit), and PowerPC (32-bit) have been  tested,  with  the  x86-64  version
              having  seen  the most testing. Under FreeBSD, 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x86-64) versions have been
              tested. Only 32-bit versions for Mac OS X and Windows have been tested  by  the  author,  although
              I've heard of 64-bit versions being successfully compiled.

       <b>*</b>      The  FreeBSD  version  of  the  program  can't write changes to the partition table to a disk when
              existing partitions on that disk are mounted. (The same problem exists  with  many  other  FreeBSD
              utilities,  such  as  <b>gpt</b>,  <b>fdisk</b>,  and  <b>dd</b>.)  This  limitation  can  be overcome by typing <b>sysctl</b>
              <b>kern.geom.debugflags=16</b> at a shell prompt.

       <b>*</b>      The fields used to display the start and end sector numbers for partitions in the 'p' command  are
              14  characters  wide.  This  translates  to  a  limitation  of  about 45 PiB. On larger disks, the
              displayed columns will go out of alignment.

       <b>*</b>      In the Windows version, only ASCII characters are supported in the partition  name  field.  If  an
              existing partition uses non-ASCII UTF-16 characters, they're likely to be corrupted in the 'i' and
              'p'  menu options' displays; however, they should be preserved when loading and saving partitions.
              Binaries for Linux, FreeBSD, and OS X support full UTF-16 partition names.

       <b>*</b>      The program can load only up to 128 partitions (4 primary partitions and 124  logical  partitions)
              when  converting  from  MBR format. This limit can be raised by changing the <u>#define</u> <u>MAX_MBR_PARTS</u>
              line in the <u>basicmbr.h</u> source code file and recompiling; however, such a change will require using
              a larger-than-normal partition table. (The limit of 128 partitions was chosen because that  number
              equals the 128 partitions supported by the most common partition table size.)

       <b>*</b>      Converting  from  MBR  format  sometimes fails because of insufficient space at the start or (more
              commonly) the end of the disk. Resizing the partition table (using the 's' option in the  experts'
              menu) can sometimes overcome this problem; however, in extreme cases it may be necessary to resize
              a partition using GNU Parted or a similar tool prior to conversion with <b>gdisk</b>.

       <b>*</b>      MBR  conversions  work  only  if the disk has correct LBA partition descriptors. These descriptors
              should be present on any disk over 8 GiB in size or on smaller disks partitioned with any but very
              ancient software.

       <b>*</b>      BSD disklabel support can create first and/or last partitions  that  overlap  with  the  GPT  data
              structures.  This  can  sometimes  be  compensated  by  adjusting the partition table size, but in
              extreme cases the affected partition(s) may need to be deleted.

       <b>*</b>      Because of the highly variable nature of BSD disklabel structures, conversions from this form  may
              be  unreliable  --  partitions may be dropped, converted in a way that creates overlaps with other
              partitions, or converted with incorrect start or end values. Use this feature with caution!

       <b>*</b>      Booting after converting an MBR or BSD  disklabel  disk  is  likely  to  be  disrupted.  Sometimes
              re-installing  a  boot  loader  will  fix the problem, but other times you may need to switch boot
              loaders. Except on EFI-based platforms, Windows through at least Windows 7 doesn't support booting
              from GPT disks. Creating a hybrid MBR (using the 'h' option on the recovery &amp; transformation menu)
              or abandoning GPT in favor of MBR may be your only options in this case.
