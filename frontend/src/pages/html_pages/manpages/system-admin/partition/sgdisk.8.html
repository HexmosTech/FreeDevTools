</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sgdisk - Command-line GUID partition table (GPT) manipulator for Linux and Unix

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sgdisk</b> [ options ] <u>device</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       GPT  fdisk  is  a  text-mode  menu-driven  package  for creation and manipulation of partition tables. It
       consists of two programs: the text-mode interactive <b>gdisk</b> and the  command-line  <b>sgdisk</b>.  Either  program
       will  automatically convert an old-style Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table or BSD disklabel stored
       without an MBR carrier partition to the newer Globally Unique Identifier  (GUID)  Partition  Table  (GPT)
       format, or will load a GUID partition table. This man page documents the command-line <b>sgdisk</b> program.

       Some  advanced  data manipulation and recovery options require you to understand the distinctions between
       the main and backup data, as well as between the GPT headers and the partition tables. For information on
       MBR vs. GPT, as well  as  GPT  terminology  and  structure,  see  the  extended  <b>gdisk</b>  documentation  at
       <u>https://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/</u> or consult Wikipedia.

       The <b>sgdisk</b> program employs a user interface that's based entirely on the command line, making it suitable
       for  use  in  scripts or by experts who want to make one or two quick changes to a disk. (The program may
       query the user when certain errors are encountered, though.) The program's name is based on  <b>sfdisk</b>,  but
       the user options of the two programs are entirely different from one another.

       Ordinarily,  <b>sgdisk</b>  operates  on disk device files, such as <u>/dev/sda</u> or <u>/dev/hda</u> under Linux, <u>/dev/disk0</u>
       under Mac OS X, or <u>/dev/ad0</u> or <u>/dev/da0</u> under FreeBSD. The program can also operate on disk image  files,
       which  can  be  either  copies  of  whole  disks  (made with <b>dd</b>, for instance) or raw disk images used by
       emulators such as QEMU or VMWare. Note that only <u>raw</u> disk images are supported;  <b>sgdisk</b>  cannot  work  on
       compressed or other advanced disk image formats.

       The MBR partitioning system uses a combination of cylinder/head/sector (CHS) addressing and logical block
       addressing  (LBA).  The  former is klunky and limiting. GPT drops CHS addressing and uses 64-bit LBA mode
       exclusively. Thus, GPT data structures, and therefore <b>sgdisk</b>, do not need to deal with CHS geometries and
       all the problems they create.

       For best results, you should use an OS-specific partition table program whenever possible.  For  example,
       you  should make Mac OS X partitions with the Mac OS X Disk Utility program and Linux partitions with the
       Linux <b>gdisk</b>, <b>sgdisk</b>, or GNU Parted programs.

       Upon start, <b>sgdisk</b> attempts to identify the partition type in use on the disk.  If  it  finds  valid  GPT
       data,  <b>sgdisk</b>  will use it. If <b>sgdisk</b> finds a valid MBR or BSD disklabel but no GPT data, it will attempt
       to convert the MBR or disklabel into GPT form. (BSD disklabels are likely to have unusable  first  and/or
       final  partitions because they overlap with the GPT data structures, though.) GPT fdisk can identify, but
       not use data in, Apple Partition Map (APM) disks, which are used on 680x0- and PowerPC-based Macintoshes.
       If you specify any option that results in changes to an  MBR  or  BSD  disklabel,  <b>sgdisk</b>  ignores  those
       changes  unless  the  <u>-g</u>  (<u>--mbrtogpt</u>),  <u>-z</u>  (<u>--zap</u>), or <u>-Z</u> (<u>--zap-all</u>) option is used. If you use the <u>-g</u>
       option, <b>sgdisk</b> replaces the MBR or disklabel with a GPT.  <u>This</u>  <u>action</u>  <u>is</u>  <u>potentially</u>  <u>dangerous!</u>  Your
       system may become unbootable, and partition type codes may become corrupted if the disk uses unrecognized
       type codes. Boot problems are particularly likely if you're multi-booting with any GPT-unaware OS.

       The MBR-to-GPT conversion will leave at least one gap in the partition numbering if the original MBR used
       logical  partitions. These gaps are harmless, but you can eliminate them by using the <u>-s</u> (<u>--sort</u>) option,
       if you like. (Doing this may require you to update your <u><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></u> file.)

       When creating a fresh partition table, certain considerations may be in order:

       <b>*</b>      For data (non-boot) disks, and for boot disks used on BIOS-based computers with GRUB as  the  boot
              loader, partitions may be created in whatever order and in whatever sizes are desired.

       <b>*</b>      Boot  disks  for  EFI-based  systems  require an <u>EFI</u> <u>System</u> <u>Partition</u> (<b>gdisk</b> internal code 0xEF00)
              formatted as FAT-32. I recommended making this partition 550 MiB. (Smaller ESPs  are  common,  but
              some  EFIs  have  flaky  FAT  drivers that necessitate a larger partition for reliable operation.)
              Boot-related files are stored here. (Note that GNU Parted identifies such partitions as having the
              "boot flag" set.)

       <b>*</b>      Some boot loaders for BIOS-based systems make use of a <u>BIOS</u> <u>Boot</u> <u>Partition</u>  (<b>gdisk</b>  internal  code
              0xEF02),  in  which  the  secondary  boot  loader  is  stored,  possibly  without the benefit of a
              filesystem. (GRUB2 may optionally use such a partition.) This partition  can  typically  be  quite
              small  (roughly  32 to 200 KiB, although 1 MiB is more common in practice), but you should consult
              your boot loader documentation for details.

       <b>*</b>      If Windows is to boot from a GPT disk, a partition of type  <u>Microsoft</u>  <u>Reserved</u>  (<b>sgdisk</b>  internal
              code 0x0C01) is recommended. This partition should be about 128 MiB in size. It ordinarily follows
              the  EFI  System  Partition  and  immediately precedes the Windows data partitions. (Note that GNU
              Parted creates all FAT partitions as this type, which actually makes the  partition  unusable  for
              normal file storage in both Windows and Mac OS X.)

       <b>*</b>      Some  OSes'  GPT  utilities  create some blank space (typically 128 MiB) after each partition. The
              intent is to enable future disk utilities to use this space. Such free space is  not  required  of
              GPT disks, but creating it may help in future disk maintenance.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Some  options take no arguments, others take one argument (typically a partition number), and others take
       compound arguments with colon delimitation. For instance, <u>-n</u> (<u>--new</u>) takes a partition number, a starting
       sector number, and an ending sector number, as in <b>sgdisk</b> <b>-n</b> <b>2:2000:50000</b> <b>/dev/sdc</b>, which  creates  a  new
       partition, numbered 2, starting at sector 2000 an ending at sector 50,000, on <u>/dev/sdc</u>.

       Unrelated  options  may be combined; however, some such combinations will be nonsense (such as deleting a
       partition and then changing its GUID type code).  <b>sgdisk</b> interprets options in the order in which they're
       entered, so effects can vary depending on order. For instance, <b>sgdisk</b> <b>-s</b> <b>-d</b> <b>2</b> sorts the  partition  table
       entries  and then deletes partition 2 from the newly-sorted list; but <b>sgdisk</b> <b>-d</b> <b>2</b> <b>-s</b> deletes the original
       partition 2 and then sorts the modified partition table.

       Error checking and opportunities to  correct  mistakes  in  <b>sgdisk</b>  are  minimal.  Although  the  program
       endeavors  to  keep  the GPT data structures legal, it does not prompt for verification before performing
       its actions. Unless you require a command-line-driven program,  you  should  use  the  interactive  <b>gdisk</b>
       instead of <b>sgdisk</b>, since <b>gdisk</b> allows you to quit without saving your changes, should you make a mistake.

       Although  <b>sgdisk</b>  is  based  on  the  same  partition-manipulation code as <b>gdisk</b>, <b>sgdisk</b> implements fewer
       features than its interactive sibling. Options available in <b>sgdisk</b> are:

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--set-alignment=value</b>
              Set the sector alignment multiple. GPT fdisk aligns the start of partitions to  sectors  that  are
              multiples  of this value, which defaults to 1 MiB (2048 on disks with 512-byte sectors) on freshly
              formatted disks. This alignment value is necessary to  obtain  optimum  performance  with  Western
              Digital  Advanced  Format  and similar drives with larger physical than logical sector sizes, with
              some types of RAID arrays, and with SSD devices. When the <u>-I</u> option is used, this  same  alignment
              value is used to determine partition end points; but partitions end at one less than a multiple of
              this value, to keep the partition length a multiple of this value.

       <b>-A,</b> <b>--attributes=list|[partnum:show|or|nand|xor|=|set|clear|toggle|get[:bitnum|hexbitmask]]</b>
              View  or  set  partition  attributes.  Use  <u>list</u> to see defined (known) attribute values. Omit the
              partition number (and even the device filename) when using  this  option.  The  others  require  a
              partition  number. The <u>show</u> and <u>get</u> options show the current attribute settings (all attributes or
              for a particular bit, respectively). The <u>or</u>, <u>nand</u>, <u>xor</u>, <u>=</u>, <u>set</u>, <u>clear</u>, and <u>toggle</u>  options  enable
              you  to  change  the  attribute  bit  value. The <u>set</u>, <u>clear</u>, <u>toggle</u>, and <u>get</u> options work on a bit
              number; the others work on a hexadecimal bit mask. For example, type <b>sgdisk</b> <b>-A</b> <b>4:set:2</b> <b>/dev/sdc</b> to
              set the bit 2 attribute (legacy BIOS bootable) on partition 4 on <u>/dev/sdc</u>.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--backup=file</b>
              Save partition data to a backup file. You can back up your current in-memory partition table to  a
              disk file using this option. The resulting file is a binary file consisting of the protective MBR,
              the  main  GPT  header, the backup GPT header, and one copy of the partition table, in that order.
              Note that the backup is of the current in-memory data structures, so if you  launch  the  program,
              make  changes,  and  then  use  this option, the backup will reflect your changes. If the GPT data
              structures are damaged, the backup may not accurately reflect the  damaged  state;  instead,  they
              will reflect GPT fdisk's first-pass interpretation of the GPT.

       <b>-B,</b> <b>--byte-swap-name=partnum</b>
              Swap  the  byte  order for the name of the specified partition. Some partitioning tools, including
              GPT fdisk 1.0.7 and earlier, can write the partition name in the wrong byte  order  on  big-endian
              computers,  such  as  the  IBM  s390 mainframes and PowerPC-based Macs. This feature corrects this
              problem.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--change-name=partnum:name</b>
              Change the GPT name of a partition. This name is encoded as a UTF-16 string, but proper entry  and
              display  of  anything beyond basic ASCII values requires suitable locale and font support. For the
              most part, Linux ignores the partition name, but it may be important in some OSes. If you want  to
              set  a  name that includes a space, enclose it in quotation marks, as in <u>sgdisk</u> <u>-c</u> <u>1:"Sample</u> <u>Name"</u>
              <u>/dev/sdb</u>. Note that the GPT name of a partition is distinct from the  filesystem  name,  which  is
              encoded in the filesystem's data structures.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--recompute-chs</b>
              Recompute  CHS  values  in  protective  or  hybrid  MBR.  This option can sometimes help if a disk
              utility, OS, or BIOS doesn't like the CHS values used by  the  partitions  in  the  protective  or
              hybrid  MBR.  In  particular, the GPT specification requires a CHS value of 0xFFFFFF for over-8GiB
              partitions, but this value is technically illegal by the usual standards. Some BIOSes hang if they
              encounter this value. This option will recompute a more normal CHS value -- 0xFEFFFF for over-8GiB
              partitions, enabling these BIOSes to boot.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--delete=partnum</b>
              Delete a partition. This action deletes the entry from the partition table but  does  not  disturb
              the  data within the sectors originally allocated to the partition on the disk. If a corresponding
              hybrid MBR partition exists, <b>gdisk</b> deletes it, as well, and expands any adjacent  0xEE  (EFI  GPT)
              MBR protective partition to fill the new free space.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--display-alignment</b>
              Display  current  sector  alignment  value.  Partitions will be created on multiples of the sector
              value reported by this option. You can change the alignment value with the -a option.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--move-second-header</b>
              Move backup GPT data structures to the end of the disk. Use this option if you've added disks to a
              RAID array, thus creating a virtual disk with space that follows the backup GPT  data  structures.
              This command moves the backup GPT data structures to the end of the disk, where they belong.

       <b>-E,</b> <b>--end-of-largest</b>
              Displays  the  sector  number  of the end of the largest available block of sectors on the disk. A
              script may store this value and pass it back as part of <u>-n</u>'s option to create a partition.  If  no
              unallocated sectors are available, this function returns the value 0.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--first-in-largest</b>
              Displays  the  sector number of the start of the largest available block of sectors on the disk. A
              script may store this value and pass it back as part of <u>-n</u>'s option to create a partition.  If  no
              unallocated  sectors are available, this function returns the value 0. Note that this parameter is
              blind to partition alignment; when you actually create a  partition,  its  start  point  might  be
              changed from this value.

       <b>-F,</b> <b>--first-aligned-in-largest</b>
              Similar  to  <u>-f</u>  (<u>--first-in-largest</u>), except returns the sector number with the current alignment
              correction applied. Use this function if you need to compute  the  actual  partition  start  point
              rather  than a theoretical start point or the actual start point if you set the alignment value to
              1.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--mbrtogpt</b>
              Convert an MBR or BSD disklabel disk to a GPT disk. As a safety measure, use  of  this  option  is
              required  on  MBR  or  BSD disklabel disks if you intend to save your changes, in order to prevent
              accidentally damaging such disks.

       <b>-G,</b> <b>--randomize-guids</b>
              Randomize the disk's GUID and all partitions' unique GUIDs (but  not  their  partition  type  code
              GUIDs).  This  function  may  be used after cloning a disk in order to render all GUIDs once again
              unique.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--hybrid</b>
              Create a hybrid MBR. This option takes from one to three partition numbers, separated  by  colons,
              as arguments. You may optionally specify a final partition "EE" to indicate that the EFI GPT (type
              0xEE)  should  be  placed  last  in  the table, otherwise it will be placed first, followed by the
              partition(s) you specify.  Their type codes are based on the  GPT  fdisk  type  codes  divided  by
              0x0100,  which  is  usually  correct for Windows partitions. If the active/bootable flag should be
              set, you must do so in another program, such as <b>fdisk</b>. The <b>gdisk</b> program offers additional  hybrid
              MBR creation options.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--info=partnum</b>
              Show  detailed  partition  information.  The  summary  information  produced  by  the  <u>-p</u>  command
              necessarily omits many details, such as  the  partition's  unique  GUID  and  the  translation  of
              <b>sgdisk</b>'s  internal  partition  type  code  to  a  plain  type  name.  The  <u>-i</u> option displays this
              information for a single partition.

       <b>-I,</b> <b>--align-end</b>
              When possible, align the end points of partitions to one less than a  multiple  of  the  alignment
              value. When both start and end points are aligned, partitions should be multiples of the alignment
              value  in size, which is necessary for some partition encryption tools to function correctly. This
              option applies to all partitions created <b>after</b> this option on the command  line.  Note  that  this
              alignment  is  not  always  possible; for instance, if the free space at the end of a disk is less
              than the alignment value, with the current final partition being aligned, and if <b>sgdisk</b>  is  asked
              to create a partition in that space, then it will <b>not</b> be end-aligned.

       <b>-j,</b> <b>--move-main-table=sector</b>
              Sets the start sector of the main partition table. This value is normally 2, but it may need to be
              increased  in some cases, such as when a system-on-chip (SoC) is hard-coded to read boot code from
              sector 2. I recommend against adjusting this value unless doing so is absolutely necessary.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--move-backup-table=sector</b>
              Sets the start sector of the second/backup partition table. The backup  table  is  usually  placed
              just before the last sector, which holds the backup header.  The default value is thus the size of
              the  disk, minus one, minus the total size of the partition table (in sectors, usually 32).  There
              are probably very few reasons to ever change this, and while the EFI standard does not mandate it,
              most tooling assumes the backup table to be at the very end of the disk.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--load-backup=file</b>
              Load partition data from a backup file. This option is the reverse of the  <u>-b</u>  option.  Note  that
              restoring  partition data from anything but the original disk is not recommended. This option will
              work even if the disk's original partition table is bad; however, most other options on  the  same
              command line will be ignored.

       <b>-L,</b> <b>--list-types</b>
              Display  a  summary of partition types. GPT uses a GUID to identify partition types for particular
              OSes and purposes. For ease of data entry,  <b>sgdisk</b>  compresses  these  into  two-byte  (four-digit
              hexadecimal)  values that are related to their equivalent MBR codes. Specifically, the MBR code is
              multiplied by hexadecimal 0x0100. For instance, the code for Linux swap space in MBR is 0x82,  and
              it's  0x8200  in <b>gdisk</b>. A one-to-one correspondence is impossible, though. Most notably, the codes
              for all varieties of FAT and NTFS partition correspond to a single GPT code (entered as 0x0700  in
              <b>sgdisk</b>). Some OSes use a single MBR code but employ many more codes in GPT. For these, <b>sgdisk</b> adds
              code numbers sequentially, such as 0xa500 for a FreeBSD disklabel, 0xa501 for FreeBSD boot, 0xa502
              for  FreeBSD  swap, and so on. Note that these two-byte codes are unique to <b>gdisk</b> and <b>sgdisk</b>. This
              option does not require you to specify a valid disk device filename.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--gpttombr</b>
              Convert disk from GPT to MBR form. This option takes from one to four partition numbers, separated
              by colons, as arguments. Their type codes are based on the GPT fdisk type codes divided by 0x0100.
              If the active/bootable flag should be set, you must do so in another program, such as <b>fdisk</b>.   The
              <b>gdisk</b>  program  offers  additional MBR conversion options. It is not possible to convert more than
              four partitions from GPT to MBR form or to convert partitions that start above the  2TiB  mark  or
              that are larger than 2TiB.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--new=partnum:start:end</b>
              Create  a new partition. You enter a partition number, starting sector, and an ending sector. Both
              start and end sectors can be specified in  absolute  terms  as  sector  numbers  or  as  positions
              measured  in  kibibytes  (K),  mebibytes  (M), gibibytes (G), tebibytes (T), or pebibytes (P); for
              instance, <b>40M</b> specifies a position 40MiB from the start of the disk.  You  can  specify  locations
              relative  to  the  start or end of the specified default range by preceding the number by a '+' or
              '-' symbol, as in <b>+2G</b> to specify a point 2GiB after the default start sector, or <b>-200M</b> to  specify
              a  point  200MiB before the last available sector. A start or end value of 0 specifies the default
              value, which is the start of the largest available block for the start sector and the end  of  the
              same  block for the end sector. A partnum value of 0 causes the program to use the first available
              partition number. Subsequent uses of the <u>-A</u> (<u>--attributes</u>), <u>-c</u> (<u>--change-name</u>),  <u>-t</u>  (<u>--typecode</u>),
              and <u>-u</u> (<u>--partition-guid</u>) options may also use <u>0</u> to refer to the same partition.

       <b>-N,</b> <b>--largest-new=num</b>
              Create  a  new  partition that fills the largest available block of space on the disk. You can use
              the <u>-a</u> (<u>--set-alignment</u>) option to adjust the alignment, if desired. A num value of 0  causes  the
              program  to use the first available partition number. Subsequent uses of the <u>-A</u> (<u>--attributes</u>), <u>-c</u>
              (<u>--change-name</u>), <u>-t</u> (<u>--typecode</u>), and <u>-u</u> (<u>--partition-guid</u>) options may also use <u>0</u> to refer to the
              same partition.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--clear</b>
              Clear out all partition data. This includes GPT header data, all partition  definitions,  and  the
              protective MBR. Note that this operation will, like most other operations, fail on a damaged disk.
              If you want to prepare a disk you know to be damaged for GPT use, you should first wipe it with -Z
              and  then partition it normally. This option will work even if the disk's original partition table
              is bad; however, most other options on the same command line will be ignored.

       <b>-O,</b> <b>--print-mbr</b>
              Display basic <u>MBR</u> partition summary data. This includes partition  numbers,  starting  and  ending
              sector  numbers,  partition  sizes, MBR partition types codes, and partition names. This option is
              useful mainly for diagnosing partition table problems, particularly on disks with hybrid MBRs.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--print</b>
              Display basic GPT partition summary data. This includes partition  numbers,  starting  and  ending
              sector  numbers,  partition  sizes,  <b>sgdisk</b>'s  partition  types  codes,  and  partition names. For
              additional information, use the <u>-i</u> (<u>--info</u>) option.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--pretend</b>
              Pretend to make specified changes. In-memory GPT data structures are altered  according  to  other
              parameters, but changes are not written to disk.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--transpose</b>
              Swap two partitions' entries in the partition table. One or both partitions may be empty, although
              swapping  two  empty  partitions  is  pointless.  For  instance,  if  partitions  1-4 are defined,
              transposing 1 and 5 results in a table with partitions numbered from 2-5.  Transposing  partitions
              in  this  way  has  no  effect  on  their disk space allocation; it only alters their order in the
              partition table.

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--replicate=second_device_filename</b>
              Replicate the main device's partition table  on  the  specified  second  device.   Note  that  the
              replicated  partition  table  is an exact copy, including all GUIDs; if the device should have its
              own unique GUIDs, you should use the -G option on the new disk.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--sort</b>
              Sort partition entries. GPT partition numbers need not match the order of partitions on the  disk.
              If  you  want  them to match, you can use this option.  Note that some partitioning utilities sort
              partitions whenever they make changes. Such changes will be reflected in your device filenames, so
              you may need to edit <u><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></u> if you use this option.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--typecode=partnum:{hexcode|GUID}</b>
              Change a single partition's type code. You enter the type code using either a two-byte hexadecimal
              number,   as   described    earlier,    or    a    fully-specified    GUID    value,    such    as
              EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7.

       <b>-T,</b> <b>--transform-bsd=partnum</b>
              Transform  BSD partitions into GPT partitions. This option works on BSD disklabels held within GPT
              (or converted MBR) partitions.  Converted  partitions'  type  codes  are  likely  to  need  manual
              adjustment.  <b>sgdisk</b>  will attempt to convert BSD disklabels stored on the main disk when launched,
              but this conversion is likely to produce first and/or last partitions that are unusable. The  many
              BSD  variants means that the probability of <b>sgdisk</b> being unable to convert a BSD disklabel is high
              compared to the likelihood of problems with an MBR conversion.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--partition-guid=partnum:guid</b>
              Set the partition unique GUID for an individual partition. The GUID may be a complete GUID or  'R'
              to set a random GUID.

       <b>-U,</b> <b>--disk-guid=guid</b>
              Set the GUID for the disk. The GUID may be a complete GUID or 'R' to set a random GUID.

       <b>--usage</b>
              Print a brief summary of available options.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verify</b>
              Verify  disk.  This option checks for a variety of problems, such as incorrect CRCs and mismatched
              main and backup data. This option does not automatically correct most problems, though; for  that,
              you must use options on the recovery &amp; transformation menu. If no problems are found, this command
              displays  a  summary  of unallocated disk space. This option will work even if the disk's original
              partition table is bad; however, most other options on the same command line will be ignored.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Display program version information. This option may be used without specifying a device filename.

       <b>-z,</b> <b>--zap</b>
              Zap (destroy) the GPT data structures and then exit. Use this option if you want to repartition  a
              GPT  disk  using  <b>fdisk</b>  or some other GPT-unaware program. This option destroys only the GPT data
              structures; it leaves the MBR intact. This makes it useful for  wiping  out  GPT  data  structures
              after  a  disk has been repartitioned for MBR using a GPT-unaware utility; however, there's a risk
              that it will damage boot loaders or even the start of the first or end of the last MBR  partition.
              If  you  use  it  on  a  valid GPT disk, the MBR will be left with an inappropriate EFI GPT (0xEE)
              partition definition, which you can delete using another utility.

       <b>-Z,</b> <b>--zap-all</b>
              Zap (destroy) the GPT and MBR data structures and then exit. This option works much like  <u>-z</u>,  but
              as it wipes the MBR as well as the GPT, it's more suitable if you want to repartition a disk after
              using this option, and completely unsuitable if you've already repartitioned the disk.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sgdisk</b> returns various values depending on its success or failure:

       <b>0</b>      Normal program execution

       <b>1</b>      Too few arguments

       <b>2</b>      An error occurred while reading the partition table

       <b>3</b>      Non-GPT disk detected and no <u>-g</u> option, but operation requires a write action

       <b>4</b>      An error prevented saving changes

       <b>5</b>      An  error  occurred  while  reading  standard  input (should never occur with sgdisk, but may with
              gdisk)

       <b>8</b>      Disk replication operation (-R) failed

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Known bugs and limitations include:

       <b>*</b>      The program compiles correctly only on Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X.  Linux  versions  for  x86-64
              (64-bit), x86 (32-bit), and PowerPC (32-bit) have been tested, with the x86-64 version having seen
              the most testing.

       <b>*</b>      The  FreeBSD  version  of  the  program  can't write changes to the partition table to a disk when
              existing partitions on that disk are mounted. (The same problem exists  with  many  other  FreeBSD
              utilities,  such  as  <b>gpt</b>,  <b>fdisk</b>,  and  <b>dd</b>.)  This  limitation  can  be overcome by typing <b>sysctl</b>
              <b>kern.geom.debugflags=16</b> at a shell prompt.

       <b>*</b>      The fields used to display the start and end sector numbers for partitions in the <u>-p</u> option are 14
              characters wide. This translates to a limitation of about 45 PiB. On larger disks,  the  displayed
              columns will go out of alignment.

       <b>*</b>      The  program  can load only up to 128 partitions (4 primary partitions and 124 logical partitions)
              when converting from MBR format. This limit can be raised by changing  the  <u>#define</u>  <u>MAX_MBR_PARTS</u>
              line in the <u>basicmbr.h</u> source code file and recompiling; however, such a change will require using
              a  larger-than-normal partition table. (The limit of 128 partitions was chosen because that number
              equals the 128 partitions supported by the most common partition table size.)

       <b>*</b>      Converting from MBR format sometimes fails because of insufficient space at  the  start  or  (more
              commonly)  the end of the disk. Resizing the partition table (using the 's' option in the experts'
              menu) can sometimes overcome this problem; however, in extreme cases it may be necessary to resize
              a partition using GNU Parted or a similar tool prior to conversion with <b>gdisk</b>.

       <b>*</b>      MBR conversions work only if the disk has correct LBA  partition  descriptors.  These  descriptors
              should be present on any disk over 8 GiB in size or on smaller disks partitioned with any but very
              ancient software.

       <b>*</b>      BSD  disklabel  support  can  create  first  and/or last partitions that overlap with the GPT data
              structures. This can sometimes be compensated by  adjusting  the  partition  table  size,  but  in
              extreme cases the affected partition(s) may need to be deleted.

       <b>*</b>      Because  of the highly variable nature of BSD disklabel structures, conversions from this form may
              be unreliable -- partitions may be dropped, converted in a way that creates  overlaps  with  other
              partitions, or converted with incorrect start or end values. Use this feature with caution!

       <b>*</b>      Booting  after  converting  an  MBR  or  BSD  disklabel  disk is likely to be disrupted. Sometimes
              re-installing a boot loader will fix the problem, but other times you  may  need  to  switch  boot
              loaders.  Except  on  EFI-based  platforms,  Windows through at least Windows 7 RC doesn't support
              booting from GPT  disks.  Creating  a  hybrid  MBR  (using  the  'h'  option  on  the  recovery  &amp;
              transformation menu) or abandoning GPT in favor of MBR may be your only options in this case.
