</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>opendmarc</b> - DMARC email policy filter for MTAs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>opendmarc</b>  [-A]  [-c  configfile]  [-f] [-l] [-n] [-p socketspec] [-P pidfile] [-t file[,file[...]]]  [-u
       userid[:group]] [-v] [-V]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>opendmarc</b> implements the proposed <b>DMARC</b> specification for authentication  of  message  and  reporting  of
       observed traffic.

       <b>opendmarc</b>  uses  the  <u>milter</u> interface, originally distributed as part of version 8.11 of <b><a href="../man8/sendmail.8.html">sendmail</a>(8),</b> to
       provide a DMARC processing service for mail transiting a milter-aware MTA.

       Most, if not all, of the command line options listed below can also be set using  a  configuration  file.
       See the <u>-c</u> option for details.

       <b>opendmarc</b>  relies  on  addition  of Authentication-Results fields by upstream filters on trusted hosts to
       collect input to the DMARC algorithm.  It does not itself do DKIM or SPF evaluation.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-A</u>     Automatically re-start on failures.  Use with caution; if the  filter  fails  instantly  after  it
              starts,  this  can  cause  a  tight  <u><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a>(2)</u> loop.  This can be mitigated using some values in the
              configuration file to limit restarting.  See <u><a href="../man5/opendmarc.conf.5.html">opendmarc.conf</a>(5).</u>

       <u>-c</u> <u>configfile</u>
              Read the named configuration file.  See the <u><a href="../man5/opendmarc.conf.5.html">opendmarc.conf</a>(5)</u> man page for details.  Values in the
              configuration file are overridden when their equivalents are provided on the command line until  a
              configuration  reload  occurs.   The  OPERATION  section describes how reloads are triggered.  The
              default is to read a configuration file from <u>/etc/opendmarc.conf</u> if one exists,  or  otherwise  to
              apply defaults to all values.

       <u>-f</u>     Normally  <u>opendmarc</u>  forks  and  exits immediately, leaving the service running in the background.
              This flag suppresses that behaviour so that it runs in the foreground.

       <u>-l</u>     Log via calls to <u><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a>(3)</u> any interesting activity.

       <u>-n</u>     Parse the configuration file and command line arguments, reporting  any  errors  found,  and  then
              exit.   The  exit  value  will  be  0  if the filter would start up without complaint, or non-zero
              otherwise.

       <u>-p</u> <u>socketspec</u>
              Specifies the socket that should  be  established  by  the  filter  to  receive  connections  from
              <u><a href="../man8/sendmail.8.html">sendmail</a>(8)</u>  in  order  to  provide  service.  <u>socketspec</u> is in one of two forms: <u>local:path</u> which
              creates a UNIX domain socket at the specified <u>path,</u> or <u>inet:port[@host]</u> or <u>inet6:port[@host]</u> which
              creates a TCP socket on the specified <u>port</u> within the specified protocol family.  If the  <u>host</u>  is
              not  given  as either a hostname or an IP address, the socket will be listening on all interfaces.
              If neither socket type is specified, <u>local</u> is assumed, meaning the parameter is interpreted  as  a
              path  at  which  the  socket  should be created.  If an IP address is used, it must be enclosed in
              square brackets.  This parameter is mandatory.

       <u>-P</u> <u>pidfile</u>
              Specifies a file into which the filter should write its process ID at startup.

       <u>-t</u> <u>file[,file[,...]]</u>
              Reads email messages from the named files and processes them as  if  they  were  received  by  the
              filter.   The  service  is  not started, and actions normally sent back to the MTA will instead be
              printed on standard output.

       <u>-u</u> <u>userid[:group]</u>
              Attempts to be come the specified <u>userid</u> before starting operations.  The process will be assigned
              all of the groups and primary group ID of the named <u>userid</u> unless an alternate <u>group</u> is specified.
              See the FILE PERMISSIONS section for more information.

       <u>-v</u>     Increase verbose output during test mode (see <u>-t</u> above).  May  be  specified  more  than  once  to
              request increasing amounts of output.

       <u>-V</u>     Print  the  version  number and supported canonicalization and signature algorithms, and then exit
              without doing anything else.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       Upon receiving SIGUSR1, if the filter was started with a configuration file, it will be re-read  and  the
       new values used.  Note that any command line overrides provided at startup time will be lost when this is
       done.  Also, the following configuration file values (and their corresponding command line items, if any)
       are  not  reloaded through this process: AutoRestart (-A), AutoRestartCount, AutoRestartRate, Background,
       MilterDebug, PidFile (-P), Socket (-p), UMask, UserID (-u).  The filter does not automatically check  the
       configuration file for changes and reload.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This man page covers version 1.4.2 of <u>opendmarc.</u>
