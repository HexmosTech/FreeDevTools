</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       symlinks - symbolic link maintenance utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>symlinks</b> [ <b>-cdorstv</b> ] dirlist

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>symlinks</b>  is a useful utility for maintainers of FTP sites, CDROMs, and Linux software distributions.  It
       scans directories for symbolic links and lists them on stdout, often revealing flaws  in  the  filesystem
       tree.

       Each link is output with a classification of <b>relative</b>, <b>absolute</b>, <b>dangling</b>, <b>messy</b>, <b>lengthy</b>, or <b>other_fs</b>.

       <b>relative</b>  links are those expressed as paths relative to the directory in which the links reside, usually
       independent of the mount point of the filesystem.

       <b>absolute</b> links are those given as an absolute path from the root directory  as  indicated  by  a  leading
       slash (/).

       <b>dangling</b> links are those for which the target of the link does not currently exist.  This commonly occurs
       for <b>absolute</b> links when a filesystem is mounted at other than its customary mount point (such as when the
       normal root filesystem is mounted at <a href="file:/mnt">/mnt</a> after booting from alternative media).

       <b>messy</b>  links  are  links  which contain unnecessary slashes or dots in the path.  These are cleaned up as
       well when <b>-c</b> is specified.

       <b>lengthy</b> links are links which use "../" more than necessary in the path (eg.  <a href="file:/bin/vi">/bin/vi</a> → ..<a href="file:/bin/vim">/bin/vim</a>) These
       are only detected when <b>-s</b> is specified, and are only cleaned up when <b>-c</b> is also specified.

       <b>other_fs</b> are those links whose target currently resides on a different filesystem from where symlinks was
       run (most useful with <b>-r</b> ).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-c</u>     convert absolute links (within the same filesystem) to relative  links.   This  permits  links  to
              maintain  their validity regardless of the mount point used for the filesystem — a desirable setup
              in most cases.  This option also causes any <b>messy</b> links to be cleaned up,  and,  if  <b>-s</b>  was  also
              specified,  then <b>lengthy</b> links are also shortened.  Links affected by <b>-c</b> are prefixed with <b>changed</b>
              in the output.

       <u>-d</u>     causes <b>dangling</b> links to be removed.

       <u>-o</u>     fix  links  on  other  filesystems  encountered  while  recursing.   Normally,  other  filesystems
              encountered are not modified by symlinks.

       <u>-r</u>     recursively operate on subdirectories within the same filesystem.

       <u>-s</u>     causes <b>lengthy</b> links to be detected.

       <u>-t</u>     is  used  to  test  for  what  <b>symlinks</b> would do if <b>-c</b> were specified, but without really changing
              anything.

       <u>-v</u>     show all symbolic links.  By default, <b>relative</b> links are not shown unless <b>-v</b> is specified.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>symlinks</b> does not recurse or change links across filesystems.
