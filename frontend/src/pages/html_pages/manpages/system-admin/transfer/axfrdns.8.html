</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       axfrdns - a DNS zone-transfer server.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>axfrdns</b>  reads  a zone-transfer request in DNS-over-TCP format from its standard input, and responds with
       locally configured information.

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b></h4><pre>
       Normally <b>axfrdns</b> is set up by the <b><a href="../man8/axfrdns-conf.8.html">axfrdns-conf</a></b>(8) program.

       <b>axfrdns</b> runs chrooted in the directory specified by the <u>$ROOT</u> environment variable, under the uid and gid
       specified by the <u>$UID</u> and <u>$GID</u> environment variables.

       Normally <b>axfrdns</b> runs under <b><a href="../man1/tcpserver.1.html">tcpserver</a></b>(1) to handle TCP connections on port 53 of a local IP address.

       <b><a href="../man1/tcpserver.1.html">tcpserver</a></b>(1) is responsible  for  rejecting  connections  from  hosts  not  authorized  to  perform  zone
       transfers.

       <b>axfrdns</b> can also run under secure connection tools offering an UCSPI-compliant interface.

       <b>axfrdns</b>  looks  up  zone-transfer results in <u>data.cdb</u>, a binary file created by <b><a href="../man8/tinydns-data.8.html">tinydns-data</a></b>(8).  It also
       responds to normal client queries, such as SOA queries, which usually precede zone-transfer requests.

       <b>axfrdns</b> allows zone transfers for any zone listed in the <u>$AXFR</u> environment variable.

       <u>$AXFR</u> is a slash-separated list of domain names.  If <u>$AXFR</u> is not set, <b>axfrdns</b> allows zone transfers  for
       all zones available in <u>data.cdb</u>.

       <b>axfrdns</b>  aborts  if  it runs out of memory, or has trouble reading <u>data.cdb</u>, or receives a request larger
       than 512 bytes, or receives a truncated request, or receives a zone-transfer request disallowed by <u>$AXFR</u>,
       or receives a request not answered by <u>data.cdb</u>, or waits 60 seconds with nothing happening.

</pre><h4><b>Further</b> <b>notes</b> <b>on</b> <b>zone</b> <b>transfers</b></h4><pre>
       <b>axfrdns</b> provides every record it can find inside the target domain.  This may include  records  in  child
       zones.  Some of these records (such as glue inside a child zone) are essential; others are not.  It is up
       to the client to decide which out-of-zone records to keep.

       <b>axfrdns</b> does not provide glue records outside the target domain.

       The  zone-transfer  protocol  does not support timestamps.  If a record is scheduled to be created in the
       future, <b>axfrdns</b> does not send it; after  the  starting  time,  the  zone-transfer  client  will  continue
       claiming  that  the  record  doesn't  exist,  until it contacts <b>axfrdns</b> again.  Similarly, if a record is
       scheduled to die in the future, <b>axfrdns</b> sends it (with a 2-second TTL); after the ending time, the  zone-
       transfer client will continue providing the old record, until it contacts <b>axfrdns</b> again.

       Zone-transfer clients rely on zone serial numbers changing for every zone modification.

       <b><a href="../man8/tinydns-data.8.html">tinydns-data</a></b>(8)  uses  the modification time of the <u>data</u> file as its serial number for all zones.  Do not
       make more than one modification per second.

       BIND's zone-transfer client, <b>named-xfer</b>, converts zone-transfer data to zone-file  format.   Beware  that
       zone-file format has no generic mechanism to express records of arbitrary types;

       <b>named-xfer</b> chokes if it does not recognize a record type used in <u>data.cdb</u>.
