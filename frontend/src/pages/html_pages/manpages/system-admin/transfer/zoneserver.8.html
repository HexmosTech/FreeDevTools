</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       zoneserver - handle zone transfers and other TCP functions for MaraDNS

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>zoneserver</b> listens on port 53/tcp and handles DNS zone transfers and any DNS query done over TCP instead
       of UDP.  <b>zoneserver</b> uses a configuration file, <b>/etc/mararc</b> by default, to determine its parameters.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>zoneserver</b> <b>-f</b> <u>pointer_to_mararc_file</u>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f</b>  Specifies  the  location of the configuration file. MaraDNS uses the same configuration file for both
           the main dns server and the zoneserver.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The file format for the mararc file can be found  in  the  <b><a href="../man5/mararc.5.html">mararc</a>(5)</b>  manual  page.  In  particular,  the
       zoneserver  uses  the  zone_transfer_acl,  tcp_convert_acl,  tcp_convert_server,  and bind_address mararc
       parameters.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>MARARC</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       In this example mararc file, which is used both by maradns and zoneserver, we allow 10.1.2.3,  10.1.14.7,
       and  192.168.116.{any} to transfer zones, and we allow anyone on the internet to perform TCP queries. The
       only zone served in this example is example.com:

       ipv4_bind_addresses = "10.1.1.1" # Our IP
       tcp_convert_server = "10.1.1.1" # IP of UDP DNS server
       tcp_convert_acl = "0.0.0.0/0" # Anyone may do DNS-over-TCP
       chroot_dir = "/etc/maradns" # Where zone files are
       csv2 = {} # Initialize list of zone files
       csv2["example.com."] = "db.example.com" # example.com zone file
       # The next line is a list of who can transfer zones from us
       zone_transfer_acl = "10.1.2.3, 10.1.14.7, 192,168.116.0/24"

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The man pages <b><a href="../man8/maradns.8.html">maradns</a>(8)</b> and <b><a href="../man5/mararc.5.html">mararc</a>(5)</b>

       <a href="http://www.maradns.org">http://www.maradns.org</a>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>zoneserver</b> assumes that the authoritative NS records are immediately after the SOA record, and that there
       is at least one non-NS between that last authority NS record for the zone and  the  first  delegation  NS
       record.

       IXFR  requests  are  incremental  zone transfers, meaning that the DNS server should only display records
       changed since the last IXFR request.  <b>zoneserver</b>, however, treats an IXFR as if it were an AXFR  request,
       outputting all of the records for the zone in question.

       <b>zoneserver</b> closes the TCP connection after transferring the requested zone.

       If  an  unauthorized client attempts to connect to the zoneserver, <b>zoneserver</b> immediately disconnects the
       unauthorized client.
