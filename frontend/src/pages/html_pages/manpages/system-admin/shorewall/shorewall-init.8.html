</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       shorewall-init - Companion package

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>shorewall-init</b> [start|stop]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Shorewall-init is an optional package (added in Shorewall 4.4.10) that can be installed along with
       Shorewall, Shorewall6, Shorewall-lite and/or Shorewall6-lite. It provides two key features:

        1. It can close (stop) the firewall during boot prior to starting the network. This can prevent unwanted
           connections from being accepted after the network comes up but before the firewall is started.

        2. It can interface with your distribution's ifup/ifdown scripts and/or NetworkManager to allow firewall
           actions when an interface starts or stops.

       These two capabilities can be enabled separately.

       After you install the shorewall-init package, you can activate it by modifying the Shorewall-init
       configuration file:

       •   On Debian-based system, the file is /etc/default/shorewall-init.

       •   On other systems, the file is /etc/sysconfig/shorewall-init.

       To activate the safe boot feature, edit the configuration file and set PRODUCTS to a space-separated list
       of Shorewall products that you want to be closed before networking starts.

       Example:
           PRODUCTS="shorewall shorewall6"

       You also must insure that the compiled scripts for the listed products are compiled using Shorewall
       4.4.10 or later.

       Shorewall
           <b>shorewall</b> <b>compile</b>

       Shorewall6
           <b>shorewall6</b> <b>compile</b>

       Shorewall-lite
           On the administrative system, enter the command <b>shorewall</b> <b>export</b> <b>firewall</b> from the firewall's
           configuration directory.

       Shorewall6-lite
           On the administrative system, enter the command <b>shorewall6</b> <b>export</b> <b>firewall</b> from the firewall's
           configuration directory.

       The second feature (ifup/ifdown and NetworkManager integration) should only be activated on systems that
       do not use a link status monitor line swping or LSM.

       •   Edit the configuration file and set IFUPDOWN=1

       For NetworkManager integration, you will want to disable firewall startup at boot and delay it to when
       your interface comes up. For this to work correctly, you must set the required or the optional option on
       at least one interface then:

       •   On Debian-based systems, edit <a href="file:/etc/default/">/etc/default/</a><u>product</u> for each <u>product</u> listed in the PRODUCTS setting
           and set <b>startup=0</b>.

       •   On other systems, use the distribution's service control tool (insserv, chkconfig, etc.) to disable
           startup of the products listed in the PRODUCTS setting.

       On a laptop with both Ethernet and wireless interfaces, you will want to make both interfaces optional
       and set the REQUIRE_INTERFACE option to Yes in <b>shorewall.conf</b>[1](5) or <b>shorewall6.conf</b>[1] (5). This
       causes the firewall to remain stopped until at least one of the interfaces comes up.
