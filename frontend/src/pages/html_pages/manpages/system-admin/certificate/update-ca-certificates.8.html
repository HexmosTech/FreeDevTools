</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       update-ca-certificates - update <a href="file:/etc/ssl/certs">/etc/ssl/certs</a> and ca-certificates.crt

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>update-ca-certificates</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>update-ca-certificates</b> command.

       <b>update-ca-certificates</b> is a program that manages the collection of TLS certificates for the local machine
       and  generates  ca-certificates.crt.   ca-certificates.crt is a single-file of concatenated certificates.
       The collection of individual certificates is stored at /etc/ssl/certs.

       The program reads the configuration file /etc/ca-certificates.conf. Each line gives a pathname  of  a  CA
       certificate  under  <a href="file:/usr/share/ca-certificates">/usr/share/ca-certificates</a>  that  should  be  trusted.  Lines that begin with "#" are
       comment lines and thus ignored.  Lines that begin with "!" are deselected, causing  the  deactivation  of
       the CA certificate in question.

       Certificates  must  be  in  PEM  format  and  have a .crt extension in order to be included by update-ca-
       certificates. Furthermore, all certificates  with  a  .crt  extension  found  below  /usr/local/share/ca-
       certificates are also included and implicitly trusted.

       To  add  one  or  more  certificates  to  the machine, copy the certificates in PEM format with the *.crt
       extension to /usr/local/share/ca-certificates. There should be one certificate per file, and not multiple
       certificates in a single file. Then run update-ca-certificates to merge the  new  certificates  into  the
       existing machine store at /etc/ssl/certs.

       Before  terminating,  <b>update-ca-certificates</b> invokes <b>run-parts</b> on <a href="file:/etc/ca-certificates/update.d">/etc/ca-certificates/update.d</a> and calls
       each hook with a list of certificates: those added are prefixed with a +, those removed are prefixed with
       a -.
