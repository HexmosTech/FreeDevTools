       gnt-node - Node administration

</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gnt-node</b> {command} [arguments...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>gnt-node</b> is used for managing the (physical) nodes in the Ganeti system.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ADD</b>
       <b>add</b> [--readd] [{-s|--secondary-ip} <u>secondary_ip</u>]
       [{-g|--node-group} <u>nodegroup</u>]
       [--master-capable=yes|no] [--vm-capable=yes|no]
       [--node-parameters <u>ndparams</u>]
       [--disk-state <u>diskstate</u>]
       [--hypervisor-state <u>hvstate</u>]
       [--no-node-setup]
       {<u>node-name</u>}

       Adds the given node to the cluster.

       This  command  is used to join a new node to the cluster.  You will have to provide credentials to ssh as
       root to the node to be added.  Forwarding of an ssh agent (the -A option of ssh) works, if an appropriate
       authorized key is set up on the node to be added.  If the other node allows password  authentication  for
       root,  another  way  of  providing  credentials  is  to provide the root password once asked for it.  The
       command needs to be run on the Ganeti master.

       Note that the command is potentially destructive, as it will forcibly join  the  specified  host  to  the
       cluster, not paying attention to its current status (it could be already in a cluster, etc.)

       The  -s  (--secondary-ip)  is used in dual-home clusters and specifies the new node's IP in the secondary
       network.  See the discussion in <b><a href="../man8/gnt-cluster.8.html">gnt-cluster</a></b>(8) for more information.

       In case you're re-adding a node after hardware failure, you can use the --readd parameter.  In this case,
       you don't need to pass the secondary IP again, it will be reused from the cluster.  Also, the drained and
       offline flags of the node will be cleared before re-adding it.  Note that even for re-added nodes, a  new
       SSH key is generated and distributed and previous Ganeti keys are removed from the machine.

       The -g (--node-group) option is used to add the new node into a specific node group, specified by UUID or
       name.  If only one node group exists you can skip this option, otherwise it's mandatory.

       The  --no-node-setup  option that used to prevent Ganeti from performing the initial SSH setup on the new
       node is no longer valid.  Instead, Ganeti considers the modify ssh setup configuration  parameter  (which
       is set using --no-ssh-init during cluster initialization) to determine whether or not to do the SSH setup
       on  a  new  node  or  not.   If this parameter is set to False, Ganeti will not touch the SSH keys or the
       authorized_keys file of the node at all.  Using this option, it lies in the administrators responsibility
       to ensure SSH connectivity between the hosts by other means.

       The vm_capable, master_capable, ndparams, diskstate and hvstate options are described in  <b><a href="../man7/ganeti.7.html">ganeti</a></b>(7),  and
       are used to set the properties of the new node.

       The  command  performs some operations that change the state of the master and the new node, like copying
       certificates and starting the node daemon on the new node, or updating <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> on the master node.  If
       the command fails at a later stage, it doesn't undo such changes.  This should not be  a  problem,  as  a
       successful run of gnt-node add will bring everything back in sync.

       If  the  node was previously part of another cluster and still has daemons running, the node-cleanup tool
       can be run on the machine to be added to clean remains of the previous cluster from the node.

       Example:

              # gnt-node add node5.example.com
              # gnt-node add -s 192.0.2.5 node5.example.com
              # gnt-node add -g group2 -s 192.0.2.9 node9.group2.example.com

   <b>EVACUATE</b>
       <b>evacuate</b> [-f] [--early-release] [--submit] [--print-jobid]
       [{-I--new-secondary} <u>destination_node</u>]
       [--ignore-soft-errors]
       [{-p--secondary-only} ]
        {<u>node</u>}

       This command will move instances away from the given node.  If  --primary-only  is  given,  only  primary
       instances  are evacuated, with --secondary-only only secondaries.  If neither is given, all instances are
       evacuated.  It works only for instances having a drbd disk template.

       The new location for the instances can be specified in two ways:

       • as a single node for all instances, via the -n (--new-secondary) option

       • or via the -I (--iallocator) option, giving a script name  as  parameter  (or  .  to  use  the  default
         allocator), so each instance will be in turn placed on the (per the script) optimal node

       The  --early-release  changes  the  code so that the old storage on node being evacuated is removed early
       (before the resync is completed) and the internal Ganeti locks are also released  for  both  the  current
       secondary and the new secondary, thus allowing more parallelism in the cluster operation.  This should be
       used  only  when recovering from a disk failure on the current secondary (thus the old storage is already
       broken) or when the storage on the primary node is known to be fine (thus we won't need the  old  storage
       for potential recovery).

       Note  that  this  command  is  equivalent  to  using  per-instance  commands  for  each affected instance
       individually:

       • --primary-only is equivalent to performing gnt-instance migrate for every primary instance  running  on
         the  node  that  can  be  migrated  and gnt-instance failover for every primary instance that cannot be
         migrated.

       • --secondary-only  is  equivalent  to  gnt-instance  replace-disks  in  secondary   node   change   mode
         (--new-secondary) for every DRBD instance that the node is a secondary for.

       • when neither of the above is done a combination of the two cases is run

       Note  that the iallocator currently only considers disk information of the default disk template, even if
       the instance's disk templates differ from that.

       The --ignore-soft-errors option is passed through to the allocator.

       See <b><a href="../man7/ganeti.7.html">ganeti</a></b>(7) for a description of --submit and other common options.

       Example:

              # gnt-node evacuate -I hail node3.example.com

       Note that, due to an issue with the iallocator interface, evacuation of all instances at once is not  yet
       implemented.   Full  evacuation  can  currently  be  achieved  by  sequentially  evacuating primaries and
       secondaries.  :

              # gnt-node evacuate -p node3.example.com
              # gnt-node evacuate -s node3.example.com

   <b>FAILOVER</b>
       <b>failover</b> [-f] [--ignore-consistency] {<u>node</u>}

       This command will fail over all instances having the given node as  primary  to  their  secondary  nodes.
       This works only for instances having a drbd disk template.

       Note  that  failover  will stop any running instances on the given node and restart them again on the new
       primary.  See also FAILOVER in <b><a href="../man8/gnt-instance.8.html">gnt-instance</a></b>(8).

       Normally the failover will check the consistency of the disks before failing over the instance.   If  you
       are trying to migrate instances off a dead node, this will fail.  Use the --ignore-consistency option for
       this purpose.

       Example:

              # gnt-node failover node1.example.com

   <b>INFO</b>
       <b>info</b> [<u>node</u>...]

       Show  detailed  information  about  the nodes in the cluster.  If you don't give any arguments, all nodes
       will be shown, otherwise the output will be restricted to the given names.

   <b>LIST</b>
       <b>list</b>
       [--no-headers] [--separator=*SEPARATOR*]
       [--units=*UNITS*] [-v] [{-o|--output} <u>[+]FIELD,...</u>]
       [--filter]
       [<u>node-name</u>...]

       Lists the nodes in the cluster.

       The --no-headers option will skip the initial header line.  The  --separator  option  takes  an  argument
       which denotes what will be used between the output fields.  Both these options are to help scripting.

       The  units  used  to display the numeric values in the output varies, depending on the options given.  By
       default, the values will be formatted in the most appropriate unit.  If the --separator option is  given,
       then  the  values  are shown in mebibytes to allow parsing by scripts.  In both cases, the --units option
       can be used to enforce a given output unit.

       Queries of nodes will be done in parallel with any running jobs.  This might  give  inconsistent  results
       for the free disk/memory.

       The -v option activates verbose mode, which changes the display of special field states (see <b><a href="../man7/ganeti.7.html">ganeti</a></b>(7)).

       The  -o  (--output) option takes a comma-separated list of output fields.  The available fields and their
       meaning are:

       bootid Random UUID renewed for each system reboot, can be used for detecting reboots by tracking changes

       cnodes Number of NUMA domains on node (if exported by hypervisor)

       cnos   Number of logical processors used by the node OS (dom0 for Xen)

       ndp/exclusive_storage
              The "exclusive_storage" node parameter

       ndp/oob_program
              The "oob_program" node parameter

       ndp/ovs
              The "ovs" node parameter

       ndp/ovs_link
              The "ovs_link" node parameter

       ndp/ovs_name
              The "ovs_name" node parameter

       ndp/spindle_count
              The "spindle_count" node parameter

       ndp/ssh_port
              The "ssh_port" node parameter

       ndparams
              Merged node parameters

       offline
              Whether node is marked offline

       pinst_cnt
              Number of instances with this node as primary

       pinst_list
              List of instances with this node as primary

       pip    Primary IP address

       sinst_cnt
              Number of instances with this node as secondary

       sinst_list
              List of instances with this node as secondary

       sip    Secondary IP address

       spfree Available spindles in volume group (exclusive storage only)

       sptotal
              Total spindles in volume group (exclusive storage only)

       tags   Tags

       uuid   Node UUID

       vm_capable
              Whether node can host instances

       If the value of the option starts with the character +, the new fields will be added to the default list.
       This  allows  one to quickly see the default list plus a few other fields, instead of retyping the entire
       list of fields.

       Note that some of these fields are known from the configuration of the cluster (e.g.  name, pinst, sinst,
       pip, sip) and thus the master does not need to contact the node for this data (making the listing fast if
       only fields from this set are selected), whereas the other fields are "live" fields and require  a  query
       to the cluster nodes.

       Depending  on  the virtualization type and implementation details, the mtotal, mnode and mfree fields may
       have slightly varying meanings.  For example, some solutions share the  node  memory  with  the  pool  of
       memory  used  for instances (KVM), whereas others have separate memory for the node and for the instances
       (Xen).

       Note that the field 'dtotal' and 'dfree' refer to the storage type that is defined by  the  default  disk
       template.   The  default disk template is the first on in the list of cluster-wide enabled disk templates
       and can be set with gnt-cluster modify.  Currently, only the disk templates 'plain', 'drbd', 'file',  and
       'sharedfile' support storage reporting, for all others '0' is displayed.

       If exactly one argument is given and it appears to be a query filter (see <b><a href="../man7/ganeti.7.html">ganeti</a></b>(7)), the query result is
       filtered  accordingly.   For  ambiguous  cases  (e.g.  a single field name as a filter) the --filter (-F)
       option forces the argument to be treated as a filter (e.g.  gnt-node list -F master_candidate).

       If no node names are given, then all nodes are queried.  Otherwise, only the given nodes will be listed.

   <b>LIST-DRBD</b>
       <b>list-drbd</b> [--no-headers] [--separator=*SEPARATOR*] <u>node</u>

       Lists the mapping of DRBD minors for a given node.  This outputs a static  list  of  fields  (it  doesn't
       accept the --output option), as follows:

       Node   The (full) name of the node we are querying

       Minor  The DRBD minor

       Instance
              The instance the DRBD minor belongs to

       Disk   The disk index that the DRBD minor belongs to

       Role   Either primary or secondary, denoting the role of the node for the instance (note: this is not the
              live status of the DRBD device, but the configuration value)

       PeerNode
              The node that the minor is connected to on the other end

       This  command  can  be  used  as a reverse lookup (from node and minor) to a given instance, which can be
       useful when debugging DRBD issues.

       Note that this command queries Ganeti via <b><a href="../man8/ganeti-confd.8.html">ganeti-confd</a></b>(8), so it won't be available if support for  confd
       has  not  been  enabled  at build time; furthermore, in Ganeti 2.6 this is only available via the Haskell
       version of confd (again selected at build time).

   <b>LIST-FIELDS</b>
       <b>list-fields</b> [field...]

       Lists available fields for nodes.

   <b>MIGRATE</b>
       <b>migrate</b> [-f] [--non-live] [--migration-mode=live|non-live]
       [--ignore-ipolicy] [--submit] [--print-jobid] {<u>node</u>}

       This command will migrate all instances having the given node as primary to their secondary nodes.   This
       works only for instances having a drbd disk template.

       As for the <b>gnt-instance</b> <b>migrate</b> command, the options --no-live, --migration-mode and --no-runtime-changes
       can be given to influence the migration type.

       If --ignore-ipolicy is given any instance policy violations occurring during this operation are ignored.

       See <b><a href="../man7/ganeti.7.html">ganeti</a></b>(7) for a description of --submit and other common options.

       Example:

              # gnt-node migrate node1.example.com

   <b>MODIFY</b>
       <b>modify</b> [-f] [--submit] [--print-jobid]
       [{-C|--master-candidate} yes|no]
       [{-D--offline} yes|no]
       [--master-capable=yes|no] [--vm-capable=yes|no] [--auto-promote]
       [{-s|--secondary-ip} <u>secondary_ip</u>]
       [--node-parameters <u>ndparams</u>]
       [--node-powered=yes|no]
       [--hypervisor-state <u>hvstate</u>]
       [--disk-state <u>diskstate</u>]
       {<u>node-name</u>}

       This  command  changes the role of the node.  Each options takes either a literal yes or no, and only one
       option should be given as yes.  The meaning  of  the  roles  and  flags  are  described  in  the  manpage
       <b><a href="../man7/ganeti.7.html">ganeti</a></b>(7).

       The  option  --node-powered  can  be  used  to  modify  state-of-record if it doesn't reflect the reality
       anymore.

       In case a node is demoted from the master candidate role, the operation will be refused unless  you  pass
       the  --auto-promote option.  This option will cause the operation to lock all cluster nodes (thus it will
       not be able to run in parallel with most other jobs), but it allows automated maintenance of the  cluster
       candidate  pool.   If  locking  all  cluster node is too expensive, another option is to promote manually
       another node to master candidate before demoting the current one.

       Example (setting a node offline, which will demote it from master candidate role if is in that role):

              # gnt-node modify --offline=yes node1.example.com

       The -s (--secondary-ip) option can be used to change the node's secondary ip.  No drbd instances  can  be
       running  on  the  node,  while  this  operation  is taking place.  Remember that the secondary ip must be
       reachable from the master secondary ip, when being changed, so be sure that  the  node  has  the  new  IP
       already  configured  and  active.  In order to convert a cluster from single homed to multi-homed or vice
       versa --force is needed as well, and the target node for the first change must be the master.

       See <b><a href="../man7/ganeti.7.html">ganeti</a></b>(7) for a description of --submit and other common options.

       Example (setting the node back to online and master candidate):

              # gnt-node modify --offline=no --master-candidate=yes node1.example.com

   <b>REMOVE</b>
       <b>remove</b> {<u>node-name</u>}

       Removes a node from the cluster.  Instances must be removed or migrated to another cluster before.

       Example:

              # gnt-node remove node5.example.com

   <b>VOLUMES</b>
       <b>volumes</b> [--no-headers] [--human-readable]
       [--separator=*SEPARATOR*] [{-o|--output} <u>FIELDS</u>]
       [<u>node-name</u>...]

       Lists all logical volumes and their physical disks from the node(s) provided.

       The --no-headers option will skip the initial header line.  The  --separator  option  takes  an  argument
       which denotes what will be used between the output fields.  Both these options are to help scripting.

       The  units  used  to display the numeric values in the output varies, depending on the options given.  By
       default, the values will be formatted in the most appropriate unit.  If the --separator option is  given,
       then  the  values  are shown in mebibytes to allow parsing by scripts.  In both cases, the --units option
       can be used to enforce a given output unit.

       The -o (--output) option takes a comma-separated list of output fields.  The available fields  and  their
       meaning are:

       node   the node name on which the volume exists

       phys   the physical drive (on which the LVM physical volume lives)

       vg     the volume group name

       name   the logical volume name

       size   the logical volume size

       instance
              The  name  of  the  instance  to which this volume belongs, or (in case it's an orphan volume) the
              character "-"

       Example:

              # gnt-node volumes node5.example.com
              Node              PhysDev   VG    Name                                 Size Instance
              node1.example.com /dev/hdc1 xenvg instance1.example.com-sda_11000.meta 128  instance1.example.com
              node1.example.com /dev/hdc1 xenvg instance1.example.com-sda_11001.data 256  instance1.example.com

   <b>LIST-STORAGE</b>
       <b>list-storage</b> [--no-headers] [--human-readable]
       [--separator=*SEPARATOR*] [--storage-type=*STORAGE_TYPE*]
       [{-o|--output} <u>FIELDS</u>]
       [<u>node-name</u>...]

       Lists the available storage units and their details for the given node(s).

       The --no-headers option will skip the initial header line.  The  --separator  option  takes  an  argument
       which denotes what will be used between the output fields.  Both these options are to help scripting.

       The  units  used  to display the numeric values in the output varies, depending on the options given.  By
       default, the values will be formatted in the most appropriate unit.  If the --separator option is  given,
       then  the  values  are shown in mebibytes to allow parsing by scripts.  In both cases, the --units option
       can be used to enforce a given output unit.

       The --storage-type option can be used to choose a  storage  unit  type.   Possible  choices  are  lvm-pv,
       lvm-vg, file, sharedfile and gluster.

       The  -o  (--output) option takes a comma-separated list of output fields.  The available fields and their
       meaning are:

       node   the node name on which the volume exists

       type   the type of the storage unit (currently just what is passed in via --storage-type)

       name   the path/identifier of the storage unit

       size   total size of the unit; for the file type see a note below

       used   used space in the unit; for the file type see a note below

       free   available disk space

       allocatable
              whether we the unit is available for allocation (only lvm-pv can change this  setting,  the  other
              types always report true)

       Note  that  for the "file" type, the total disk space might not equal to the sum of used and free, due to
       the method Ganeti uses to compute each of them.  The total and free values are computed as the total  and
       free  space values for the filesystem to which the directory belongs, but the used space is computed from
       the used space under that directory <u>only</u>, which might not be necessarily the root of the filesystem,  and
       as  such  there could be files outside the file storage directory using disk space and causing a mismatch
       in the values.

       Example:

              node1# gnt-node list-storage node2
              Node  Type   Name        Size Used   Free Allocatable
              node2 lvm-pv /dev/sda7 673.8G 1.5G 672.3G Y
              node2 lvm-pv /dev/sdb1 698.6G   0M 698.6G Y

   <b>MODIFY-STORAGE</b>
       <b>modify-storage</b> [--allocatable={yes|no}] [--submit] [--print-jobid]
       {<u>node-name</u>} {<u>storage-type</u>} {<u>volume-name</u>}

       Modifies storage volumes on a node.  Only LVM physical volumes can be modified at the moment.  They  have
       a storage type of "lvm-pv".

       Example:

              # gnt-node modify-storage --allocatable no node5.example.com lvm-pv /dev/sdb1

   <b>REPAIR-STORAGE</b>
       <b>repair-storage</b> [--ignore-consistency] ]--submit]
       {<u>node-name</u>} {<u>storage-type</u>} {<u>volume-name</u>}

       Repairs  a storage volume on a node.  Only LVM volume groups can be repaired at this time.  They have the
       storage type "lvm-vg".

       On LVM volume groups, <b>repair-storage</b> runs vgreduce --removemissing.

       <b>Caution:</b> Running this command can lead to data loss.  Use it with care.

       The --ignore-consistency option will ignore any inconsistent disks (on the nodes paired with  this  one).
       Use of this option is most likely to lead to data-loss.

       Example:

              # gnt-node repair-storage node5.example.com lvm-vg xenvg

   <b>POWERCYCLE</b>
       <b>powercycle</b> [--yes] [--force] [--submit] [--print-jobid] {<u>node-name</u>}

       This  command  (tries  to)  forcefully  reboot  a  node.   It  is  a command that can be used if the node
       environment is broken, such that the admin can no longer login over SSH, but the Ganeti  node  daemon  is
       still working.

       Note  that  this  command  is  not  guaranteed to work; it depends on the hypervisor how effective is the
       reboot attempt.  For Linux, this command requires the kernel option CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ to be enabled.

       The --yes option can be used to skip confirmation, while the --force option is needed if the target  node
       is the master node.

       See <b><a href="../man7/ganeti.7.html">ganeti</a></b>(7) for a description of --submit and other common options.

   <b>POWER</b>
       <b>power</b> [--force] [--ignore-status] [--all] [--power-delay] oncycle|status [<u>node-name</u>...]

       This  command  calls  out to out-of-band management to change the power state of given node.  With status
       you get the power status as reported by the out-of-band management script.

       Note that this command will only work if the out-of-band functionality is configured and enabled  on  the
       cluster.  If this is not the case, please use the <b>powercycle</b> command above.

       Currently  this  only  has  effect  for off and cycle.  For safety, Ganeti will not allow either of these
       operations to be run on the master node.  However, it will print a command line which  can  then  be  run
       manually  on the master.  Note that powering off the master is potentially dangerous, and Ganeti does not
       support doing this.

       Providing --force will skip confirmations for the operation.

       Providing --ignore-status will ignore the offline=N state of a node and continue with power off.

       --power-delay specifies the time in seconds (factions allowed) waited between powering on the next  node.
       This is by default 2 seconds but can increased if needed with this option.

       The  list  of  node  names  is optional.  If not provided it will call out for every node in the cluster.
       Except for the off and cycle command where you've to explicit use --all to select all.

   <b>HEALTH</b>
       <b>health</b> [<u>node-name</u>...]

       This command calls out to out-of-band management to ask for the health status of all or given nodes.  The
       health contains the node name and then the items element with  their  status  in  a  item=status  manner.
       Where  item  is  script  specific  and status can be one of OK, WARNING, CRITICAL or UNKNOWN.  Items with
       status WARNING or CRITICAL are logged and annotated in the command line output.

   <b>RESTRICTED-COMMAND</b>
       <b>restricted-command</b> [-M] [--sync]
       { -g <u>group</u> <u>command</u> | <u>command</u> <u>node-name</u>...  }

       Executes a restricted command on the specified nodes.  Restricted commands are not  arbitrary,  but  must
       reside  in  /etc/ganeti/restricted-commands  on  a  node,  either as a regular file or as a symlink.  The
       directory must be owned by root and not be world- or group-writable.  If a command fails verification  or
       otherwise fails to start, the node daemon log must be consulted for more detailed information.

       Example for running a command on two nodes:

              # gnt-node restricted-command mycommand \
                node1.example.com node2.example.com

       The -g option can be used to run a command only on a specific node group, e.g.:

              # gnt-node restricted-command -g default mycommand

       The -M option can be used to prepend the node name to all command output lines.  --sync forces the opcode
       to acquire the node lock(s) in exclusive mode.

   <b>Tags</b>
   <b>ADD-TAGS</b>
       <b>add-tags</b> [--from <u>file</u>] {<u>node-name</u>} {<u>tag</u>...}

       Add  tags  to  the given node.  If any of the tags contains invalid characters, the entire operation will
       abort.

       If the --from option is given, the list of tags will be extended with the contents  of  that  file  (each
       line  becomes  a tag).  In this case, there is not need to pass tags on the command line (if you do, both
       sources will be used).  A file name of - will be interpreted as stdin.

   <b>LIST-TAGS</b>
       <b>list-tags</b> {<u>node-name</u>}

       List the tags of the given node.

   <b>REMOVE-TAGS</b>
       <b>remove-tags</b> [--from <u>file</u>] {<u>node-name</u>} {<u>tag</u>...}

       Remove tags from the given node.  If any of the tags are not existing on the node, the  entire  operation
       will abort.

       If  the --from option is given, the list of tags to be removed will be extended with the contents of that
       file (each line becomes a tag).  In this case, there is not need to pass tags on the command line (if you
       do, tags from both sources will be removed).  A file name of - will be interpreted as stdin.
