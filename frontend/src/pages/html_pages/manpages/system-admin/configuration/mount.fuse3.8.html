</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fuse - configuration and mount options for FUSE file systems

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       FUSE  (Filesystem  in  Userspace)  is  a  simple  interface  for  userspace  programs to export a virtual
       filesystem to the Linux kernel. FUSE also aims to provide a secure method for  non  privileged  users  to
       create and mount their own filesystem implementations.

</pre><h4><b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FUSE</b>   The in-kernel filesystem that forwards requests to a user-space process.

       <b>filesystem</b>
              The user-space process that responds to requests received from the kernel.

       <b>libfuse</b>
              The  shared  library  that  most (user-space) filesystems use to communicate with FUSE (the kernel
              filesystem). libfuse also provides the <b>fusermount3</b> (or <b>fusermount</b> if you  have  older  version  of
              libfuse) helper to allow non-privileged users to mount filesystems.

       <b>filesystem</b> <b>owner</b>
              The  user  that  starts  the filesystem and instructs the kernel to associate it with a particular
              mountpoint. The latter is typically done by the filesystem itself on start-up. When using libfuse,
              this is done by calling the <b>fusermount3</b> utility.

       <b>client</b> Any process that interacts with the mountpoint.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Some options regarding mount policy can be set in the file <u><a href="file:/etc/fuse.conf">/etc/fuse.conf</a></u>. Currently these options are:

       <b>mount_max</b> <b>=</b> <b>NNN</b>
              Set the maximum number of FUSE mounts allowed to non-root users. The default is 1000.

       <b>user_allow_other</b>
              Allow non-root users to specify the <b>allow_other</b> or <b>allow_root</b> mount options (see below).

       These limits are enforced by the <b>fusermount3</b> helper, so they can be avoided by filesystems that run as
       root.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Most of the generic mount options described in <b>mount</b> are supported (<b>ro</b>, <b>rw</b>,  <b>suid</b>,  <b>nosuid</b>,  <b>dev</b>,  <b>nodev</b>,
       <b>exec</b>,  <b>noexec</b>,  <b>atime</b>,  <b>noatime</b>,  <b>sync</b>,  <b>async</b>,  <b>dirsync</b>).  Filesystems  are mounted with <b>nodev,nosuid</b> by
       default, which can only be overridden by a privileged user.

   <b>General</b> <b>mount</b> <b>options:</b>
       These are FUSE specific mount options that can be specified for all filesystems:

       <b>default_permissions</b>
              This option instructs the kernel to perform its own permission  check  instead  of  deferring  all
              permission  checking  to  the  filesystem.  The  check  by  the  kernel is done in addition to any
              permission checks by the filesystem, and both have to succeed for an operation to be allowed.  The
              kernel  performs  a  standard  UNIX  permission  check  (based  on  mode bits and ownership of the
              directory entry, and uid/gid of the client).

              This mount option is activated implicitly if the filesystem enables ACL support during the initial
              feature negotiation when opening the device fd. In this case, the kernel  performs  both  ACL  and
              standard unix permission checking.

              Filesystems  that  do  not  implement  any  permission  checking  should generally add this option
              internally.

       <b>allow_other</b>
              This option overrides the security measure restricting file access to  the  filesystem  owner,  so
              that all users (including root) can access the files.

       <b>rootmode=M</b>
              Specifies the file mode of the filesystem's root (in octal representation).

       <b>blkdev</b> Mount  a  filesystem  backed  by  a block device.  This is a privileged option. The device must be
              specified with the <b>fsname=NAME</b> option.

       <b>blksize=N</b>
              Set the block size for the filesystem. This option is only valid for 'fuseblk'  type  mounts.  The
              default is 512.

              In  most  cases, this option should not be specified by the filesystem owner but set internally by
              the filesystem.

       <b>max_read=N</b>
              With this option the maximum size of read operations can be set.  The  default  is  infinite,  but
              typically  the  kernel enforces its own limit in addition to this one. A value of zero corresponds
              to no limit.

              This option should not be specified by the  filesystem  owner.  The  correct  (or  optimum)  value
              depends on the filesystem implementation and should thus be set by the filesystem internally.

              This  mount  option  is  deprecated in favor of direct negotiation over the device fd (as done for
              e.g. the maximum size of write operations). For the time  being,  libfuse-using  filesystems  that
              want  to  limit the read size must therefore use this mount option <u>and</u> set the same value again in
              the init() handler.

       <b>fd=N</b>   The file descriptor to use for communication between the userspace filesystem and the kernel.  The
              file descriptor must have been obtained by opening the FUSE device (/dev/fuse).

              This option should not be specified by the filesystem owner. It is set by libfuse (or, if  libfuse
              is not used, must be set by the filesystem itself).

       <b>user_id=N</b>
              <b>group_id=N</b> Specifies the numeric uid/gid of the mount owner.

              This  option should not be specified by the filesystem owner. It is set by libfuse (or, if libfuse
              is not used, must be set by the filesystem itself).

       <b>fsname=NAME</b>
              Sets the filesystem source (first field in <u><a href="file:/etc/mtab">/etc/mtab</a></u>). The default is the name of  the  filesystem
              process.

       <b>subtype=TYPE</b>
              Sets  the  filesystem  type  (third field in <u><a href="file:/etc/mtab">/etc/mtab</a></u>). The default is the name of the filesystem
              process. If the kernel supports it, <u><a href="file:/etc/mtab">/etc/mtab</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/proc/mounts">/proc/mounts</a></u> will show the  filesystem  type  as
              <b>fuse.TYPE</b>

              If the kernel doesn't support subtypes, the source field will be <b>TYPE#NAME</b>, or if <b>fsname</b> option is
              not specified, just <b>TYPE</b>.

   <b>libfuse-specific</b> <b>mount</b> <b>options:</b>
       These  following  options  are  not actually passed to the kernel but interpreted by libfuse. They can be
       specified for all filesystems that use libfuse:

       <b>allow_root</b>
              This option is similar to <b>allow_other</b> but file access is limited to the filesystem owner and root.
              This option and <b>allow_other</b> are mutually exclusive.

       <b>auto_unmount</b>
              This option enables automatic release of the mountpoint if filesystem terminates for  any  reason.
              Normally  the  filesystem  is  responsible  for  releasing  the  mountpoint,  which means that the
              mountpoint becomes inaccessible if the filesystem terminates without first unmounting.

              This option is dangerous and should only be used after careful consideration of the risks.

              Automatically unmounting the filesystem means that if the filesystem crashes  the  mountpoint  may
              suddenly  appear  empty, which may have unintended consequences. For example, a running backup and
              mirroring program may conclude that all the data in the filesystem has been deleted and proceed to
              propagate this deletion to  the  backup  /  remote  system.  If  the  mountpoint  instead  becomes
              inaccessible (the default), most programs will behave correctly (report an error).

              This  feature  may  also  accidentally  unmount  the  wrong filesystem due to race conditions. For
              example, if another filesystem was mounted underneath the same mountpoint, or if a new  filesystem
              is mounted after the FUSE process has crashed, it may accidentally get unmounted.

              At  the moment, this option implies that the filesystem will also be mounted with <b>nodev</b> and <b>nosuid</b>
              (even when mounted by root). This restriction may be lifted in the future.

   <b>High-level</b> <b>mount</b> <b>options:</b>
       These following options are not actually passed to the kernel but interpreted by libfuse. They  can  only
       be specified for filesystems that use the high-level libfuse API:

       <b>kernel_cache</b>
              This  option  disables flushing the cache of the file contents on every <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2).  This should only
              be enabled on filesystems, where the file data  is  never  changed  externally  (not  through  the
              mounted   FUSE   filesystem).   Thus  it  is  not  suitable  for  network  filesystems  and  other
              "intermediate" filesystems.

              <b>NOTE</b>: if this option is not specified (and neither <b>direct_io</b>)  data  is  still  cached  after  the
              <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2), so a <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2) system call will not always initiate a read operation.

       <b>auto_cache</b>
              This option is an alternative to <b>kernel_cache</b>. Instead of unconditionally keeping cached data, the
              cached data is invalidated on <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2) if the modification time or the size of the file has changed
              since it was last opened.

       <b>umask=M</b> <b>fmask=M</b> <b>dmask=M</b>
              Override  the  permission bits set by the filesystem in <u>st_mode</u>. The resulting permission bits are
              the ones missing from the mask value, which is given in  octal  representation.  <b>fmask</b>  and  <b>dmask</b>
              (respectively)  may  be  used  to control the permission bits of files and directories separately.
              umask is overridden by the individual fmask and dmask options.

       <b>uid=N</b>  Override the <u>st_uid</u> field set by the filesystem (N is numeric).

       <b>gid=N</b>  Override the <u>st_gid</u> field set by the filesystem (N is numeric).

       <b>entry_timeout=T</b>
              The timeout in seconds for which name lookups will be cached. The default is 1.0 second.  For  all
              the timeout options, it is possible to give fractions of a second as well (e.g. <b>entry_timeout=2.8</b>)

       <b>negative_timeout=T</b>
              The  timeout  in  seconds for which a negative lookup will be cached. This means, that if file did
              not exist (lookup returned <b>ENOENT</b>), the lookup will only be redone  after  the  timeout,  and  the
              file/directory  will  be assumed to not exist until then.  The default is 0.0 second, meaning that
              caching negative lookups are disabled.

       <b>attr_timeout=T</b>
              The timeout in seconds for which file/directory attributes are cached.  The default is 1.0 second.

       <b>ac_attr_timeout=T</b>
              The timeout in seconds for which file attributes  are  cached  for  the  purpose  of  checking  if
              <b>auto_cache</b> should flush the file data on  open. The default is the value of <b>attr_timeout</b>

       <b>noforget</b>

       <b>remember=T</b>
              Normally,  libfuse  assigns  inodes to paths only for as long as the kernel is aware of them. With
              this option inodes are instead assigned for at least <b>T</b> seconds (or, in the case of  <b>noforget</b>,  the
              life-time  of  the  filesystem).  This  will  require more memory, but may be necessary when using
              applications that make use of inode numbers.

       <b>modules=M1[:M2...]</b>
              Add modules to the filesystem stack.  Modules are pushed in the order they are specified, with the
              original filesystem being on the bottom of the stack.

   <b>mount.fuse3</b> <b>options:</b>
       These options are interpreted by <b>mount.fuse3</b> and are thus only available when mounting a file system  via
       <b>mount.fuse3</b>  (such  as  when  mounting via the generic <b><a href="../man1/mount.1.html">mount</a></b>(1) command or <u><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></u>). Supported options
       are:

       <b>setuid=USER</b>
              Switch to <b>USER</b> and its primary group before launching the FUSE file  system  process.  mount.fuse3
              must be run as root or with <b>CAP_SETUID</b> and <b>CAP_SETGID</b> for this to work.

       <b>drop_privileges</b>
              Perform  setup  of the FUSE file descriptor and mounting the file system before launching the FUSE
              file system process. <b>mount.fuse3</b> requires privilege to do so, i.e. must be run as root or at least
              with <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> and <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b>. It will launch the file  system  process  fully  unprivileged,
              i.e.  without  <b><a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</a></b>(7)  and <b><a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</a></b>(2) flags set up such that privileges can't be reacquired
              (e.g. via setuid or fscaps binaries). This reduces risk in the  event  of  the  FUSE  file  system
              process getting compromised by malicious file system data.

</pre><h4><b>FUSE</b> <b>MODULES</b> <b>(STACKING)</b></h4><pre>
       Modules  are  filesystem stacking support to high level API. Filesystem modules can be built into libfuse
       or loaded from shared object

   <b>iconv</b>
       Perform file name character set conversion.  Options are:

       <b>from_code=CHARSET</b>
              Character set to convert from (see <b>iconv</b> <b>-l</b> for a list of possible values). Default is <b>UTF-8</b>.

       <b>to_code=CHARSET</b>
              Character set to convert to.  Default is determined by the current locale.

   <b>subdir</b>
       Prepend a given directory to each path. Options are:

       <b>subdir=DIR</b>
              Directory to prepend to all paths.  This option is <u>mandatory</u>.

       <b>rellinks</b>
              Transform absolute symlinks into relative

       <b>norellinks</b>
              Do not transform absolute symlinks into relative.  This is the default.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       The fusermount3 program is installed set-user-gid to fuse. This is done to allow users from fuse group to
       mount their own filesystem implementations.  There must however be some limitations, in order to  prevent
       Bad User from doing nasty things.  Currently those limitations are:

       1.     The user can only mount on a mountpoint, for which it has write permission

       2.     The mountpoint is not a sticky directory which isn't owned by the user (like <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> usually is)

       3.     No other user (including root) can access the contents of the mounted filesystem.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       FUSE filesystems are unmounted using the <b><a href="../man1/fusermount3.1.html">fusermount3</a></b>(1) command (<b>fusermount3</b> <b>-u</b> <b>mountpoint</b>).
