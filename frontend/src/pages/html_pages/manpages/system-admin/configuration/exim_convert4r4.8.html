</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       exim_convert4r4 - Convert Exim configuration from v3 to v4 format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>exim_convert4r4</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This script is provided to assist in updating Exim configuration files.  It reads an Exim 3 configuration
       file  on  the standard input, and writes a modified file on the standard output.  It also writes comments
       about what it has done to the standard error file.   It  assumes  that  the  input  is  a  valid  Exim  3
       configuration file.  A typical call to the conversion script might be

       <u>exim_convert4r4</u> <u>&lt;</u> <u>/etc/exim/exim.conf</u> <u>&gt;</u> <u>/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.new</u>

       The  output  file  <b>MUST</b>  be  checked and tested before trying to use it on a live system.  The conversion
       script is just an aid which does a lot of the “grunt work”.  It does not guarantee to produce an  Exim  4
       configuration that behaves exactly the same as the Exim 3 configuration it reads.

       Each option change in the new file is preceded by an identifying comment.  In fact, the conversion script
       tends  to  make quite a mess of your configuration, and you should expect to go through it afterwards and
       tidy it up by hand.

       Unless you are running a very straightforward  configuration,  the  automatic  conversion  is  likely  to
       generate  a  non-optimal  configuration.   You  should not only check it thoroughly, but also run as many
       tests as you can, to ensure that it is working as you expect.  In particular,  you  should  test  address
       routing,  using  -bt  and  -bv, and the policy controls, using -bh.  If possible, you should also do some
       live tests (i.e. send and receive some messages) before putting Exim 4 into service.

       If you have a very complicated configuration, it is possible that exim_convert4r4 will break it  in  some
       situations, which is why thorough testing is strongly recommended.

       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff than us and has more experience in
       writing manual pages, any patches would be greatly appreciated.
