              Only  use  this  option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products that do not otherwise work with
              the tool.  This option will enable a trial and error method  that  attempts  sending  various  ATA
              Identify  commands  through  vendor  specific  means.  Because  of this, certain products that may
              respond in unintended ways since they may interpret these commands  differently  than  the  bridge
              chip the command was designed for.

       <b>--forceATA</b>

              Using  this  option  will  force the current drive to be treated as a ATA drive. Only ATA commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>--forceATADMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the  protocol  set
              to DMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAPIO</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using  this  option  will  force  the tool to issue PIO commands to ATA device when possible. This

       Utility Arguments =================

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--device</b> [deviceHandle | all]

              Use  this option with most commands to specify the device handle on which to perform an operation.
              Example: /dev/sg&lt;#&gt; CSMI device handles can be specified as &lt;error&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&gt;  To  run  across  all
              devices  detected  in  the system, use the "all" argument instead of a device handle.  Example: <b>-d</b>
              all NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the

       specified options on each drive detected in the
              OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please use a script opening a separate instance for each
              device handle.

       <b>--displayLBA</b> [LBA]

              This option will read and display the contents of the specified LBA to  the  screen.  The  display
              format is hexadecimal with an ASCII translation on the side (when available).

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--scanFlags</b> [option list]

              Use  this  option  to control the output from scan with the options listed below. Multiple options
              can be combined.

       ata - show only ATA (SATA) devices
              usb - show only USB devices scsi - show only SCSI (SAS) devices nvme  -  show  only  NVMe  devices
              interfaceATA  -  show  devices  on an ATA interface interfaceUSB - show devices on a USB interface
              interfaceSCSI - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface interfaceNVME = show devices  on  an  NVMe
              interface sd - show sd device handles sgtosd - show the sd and sg device handle mapping ignoreCSMI
              - do not scan for any CSMI devices allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD handles

              to show up multiple times in the list

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--deviceInfo</b>

              Show information and features for the storage device

       <b>--llInfo</b>

              Dump low-level information about the device to assist with debugging.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--scan</b>

              Scan  the  system  and  list all storage devices with logical /dev/sg&lt;#&gt; assignments. Shows model,
              serial and firmware numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately  after  booting,
              then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--Scan</b>

              This  option  is the same as <b>--scan</b> or <b>-s</b>, however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick
              up other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may  cause  the
              OS  to  re-enumerate  them.   Use  this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a
              normal scan.  NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all  interfaces  or  all  OSs.  The
              low-level  rescan  is  not  guaranteed to find additional devices in the system when the device is
              unable to come to a ready state.

       <b>--SATInfo</b>

              Displays SATA device information on any interface using both SCSI Inquiry /  VPD  /  Log  reported
              data (translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log reported data.

       <b>--testUnitReady</b>

              Issues  a  SCSI  Test  Unit  Ready command and displays the status. If the drive is not ready, the
              sense key, asc, ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable translation from the SPC spec
              will be displayed if one is available.

       <b>--fastDiscovery</b>

       Use this option
              to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.

       <b>--bufferTest</b>

              This option will perform a test using the device's echo buffer.  The write buffer and read  buffer
              commands  are  used  to  send  &amp;  receive  different  data patterns. The patterns are compared and
              interface CRC errors are also checked (when available).  Test patterns performed are all 0's,  all
              F's, all 5's, all A's, walking 1's, walking 0's, and random data patterns.  At completion, a count
              of the number of errors will be displayed.

       <b>--butterflyTest</b>

              Use  this  option to start a butterfly test.  A butterfly test is a test that moves back and forth
              between the OD and ID of the drive over and over again until the time has expired This is a  timed
              operation.  Use  the  time  options to control how long to run this test for. The default time for
              this test is 1 minute.

       <b>--diameterTest</b> [O | M | I]

              Use this option to perform a generic read/write/verify test  at  the  specified  diameter  of  the
              drive.   Use the time options to specify a time based test or the <b>--diameterTestRange</b> option for a
              range based test.

       O - outer diameter
              M - middle diameter I - inner diameter

              The different diameters can be  combined  or  run  individually.   Ex1:  <b>--diameterTest</b>  OMI  Ex2:
              <b>--diameterTest</b> O Ex3: <b>--diameterTest</b> MI

              Inner,  middle,  and outer diameter tests refer to the physical beginning and ending sections of a
              hard disk drive with rotating magnetic media.In the case of SSD devices, these tests refer to  the
              logical beginning and ending sections of the solid state drive.

       <b>--diameterTestRange</b> [range]

              Use  this  option  with  the  <b>--diameterTest</b>  option  to perform a range based test. If a range is
              specified without any units, it is assumed to be an LBA count.  Valid units are KB, KiB, MB,  MiB,
              GB,   GiB,   TB   and   TiB.    Ex1:   "--diameterTestRange   1234567"   for  an  LBA  count  Ex2:
              "--diameterTestRange 2GB" for a 2GB range.

       <b>--errorLimit</b> [limit in number of LBAs]

              Use this option to specify a different error limit for a user generic or long generic read test or
              DST and Clean. This must be a number of

              logical LBAs to have errors. If a drive has multiple logical sectors  per  physical  sector,  this
              number will

              be adjusted for you to reflect the drive architecture.

       <b>--genericMode</b> [ read | write | verify ]

              This  options allows selection of the type of commands to use while performing a generic test. The
              modes supported are listed below:

       read - performs a generic test using read commands
              write - performs a generic test using write commands verify - performs a generic test using verify
              commands

       <b>--hours</b> [hours]

              Use this option to specify a time in hours for a timed operation to run.

       <b>--longGeneric</b>

              This option will run a long generic read test on a specified device.  A  long  generic  read  test
              reads every LBA on the device and gives a report of error LBAs at the end of the test, or when the
              error limit has been reached. Using the <b>--stopOnError</b> option will make this test stop on the first
              read  error  that  occurs.  The default error limit is 50 x number of logical sectors per physical
              sector. Example error limits are as follows:

       512L/512P: error limit = 50
              4096L/4096P: error limit = 50 512L/4096P: error limit = 400 (50 * 8)

       <b>--minutes</b> [minutes]

              Use this option to specify a time in minutes for a timed operation to run.

       <b>--randomTest</b>

              Use this option to start a random test.  This is a  timed  operation.  Use  the  time  options  to
              control how long to run this test for. The default time for this test is 1 minute.

       <b>--seconds</b> [seconds]

              Use this option to specify a time in seconds for a timed operation to run.

       <b>--shortGeneric</b>

              This  option  will  run a short generic read test on a specified device. A short generic read test
              has 3 components. A read at the Outer Diameter (OD) of the drive for 1% of the LBAs, then  a  read
              at the Inner Diameter of the drive for 1% of the LBAs, and lastly a random read of 5000 LBAs. This
              test  will  stop on the first read error that occurs.  Inner and outer diameter tests refer to the
              physical beginning and ending sections of a hard disk drive with rotating  magnetic  media.In  the
              case  of  SSD devices, these tests refer to the logical beginning and ending sections of the solid
              state drive.

       <b>--stopOnError</b>

              Use this option to make a generic read test stop on the first error found.

       <b>--twoMinuteGeneric</b>

              This option will run a 2 minute generic read test on

       a specified device. There are 3 components to this test.  A read at the Outer Diameter (OD) of the  drive
       for 45

              seconds,  then  a read at the Inner Diameter of the drive for 45 seconds, and lastly a random read
              test for 30 seconds. This test will stop on the first read error that  occurs.   Inner  and  outer
              diameter  tests  refer  to  the  physical  beginning and ending sections of a hard disk drive with
              rotating magnetic media.In the case of SSD devices, these tests refer to the logical beginning and
              ending sections of the solid state drive.

       <b>--userGenericStart</b> [LBA]

              Use this option to specify the starting LBA number for a generic read test. The <b>--userGenericRange</b>
              option must be used with this one in order to start the test.   Use  the  stop  on  error,  repair
              flags, and/or error limit flags to further customize this test.

       <b>--userGenericRange</b> [range in # of LBAs]

              Use  this option to specify the range for a generic read test. See the <b>--userGenericStart</b> help for
              additional information about using the User Generic Read tests.

       Data Destructive Commands =========================

       <b>--repairAtEnd</b>

              Use this option to repair any bad sectors found during a long or user generic read test at the end
              of the test.

       <b>--repairOnFly</b>

              Use this option to repair any bad sectors found during a long or user generic read  test  as  they
              are found.
