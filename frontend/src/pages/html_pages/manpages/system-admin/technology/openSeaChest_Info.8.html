       Utility Options ===============

       <b>--csmiIgnorePort</b> (Obsolete)

              This option is obsolete and will be removed in future versions.

       <b>--csmiUsePort</b> (Obsolete)

              This option is obsolete and will be removed in future versions.

       <b>--csmiVerbose</b> (Obsolete)

       <b>--echoCommandLine</b>

              Echo the command line entered into the utility on the screen.

       <b>--enableLegacyUSBPassthrough</b>

              Only  use  this  option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products that do not otherwise work with
              the tool.  This option will enable a trial and error method  that  attempts  sending  various  ATA
              Identify  commands  through  vendor  specific  means.  Because  of this, certain products that may
              respond in unintended ways since they may interpret these commands  differently  than  the  bridge
              chip the command was designed for.

       <b>--forceATA</b>

              Using  this  option  will  force the current drive to be treated as a ATA drive. Only ATA commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>--forceATADMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the  protocol  set
              to DMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAPIO</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using  this  option  will  force  the tool to issue PIO commands to ATA device when possible. This
              option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAUDMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the  protocol  set
              to UDMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceSCSI</b>

              Using  this  option will force the current drive to be treated as a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>

              Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now) Please report bugs/suggestions to

       Utility Arguments =================

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--device</b> [deviceHandle | all]

              Use  this option with most commands to specify the device handle on which to perform an operation.
              Example: /dev/sg&lt;#&gt; CSMI device handles can be specified as &lt;error&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&gt;  To  run  across  all
              devices  detected  in  the system, use the "all" argument instead of a device handle.  Example: <b>-d</b>
              all NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the

       specified options on each drive detected in the
              OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please use a script opening a separate instance for each
              device handle.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--scanFlags</b> [option list]

              Use this option to control the output from scan with the options listed  below.  Multiple  options
              can be combined.

       ata - show only ATA (SATA) devices
              usb  -  show  only  USB  devices scsi - show only SCSI (SAS) devices nvme - show only NVMe devices
              interfaceATA - show devices on an ATA interface interfaceUSB - show devices  on  a  USB  interface
              interfaceSCSI  -  show  devices on a SCSI or SAS interface interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe
              interface sd - show sd device handles sgtosd - show the sd and sg device handle mapping ignoreCSMI
              - do not scan for any CSMI devices allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD handles

              to show up multiple times in the list

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--deviceInfo</b>

              Show information and features for the storage device

       <b>--llInfo</b>

              Dump low-level information about the device to assist with debugging.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--scan</b>

              Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical  /dev/sg&lt;#&gt;  assignments.  Shows  model,
              serial  and  firmware numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately after booting,
              then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--Scan</b>

              This option is the same as <b>--scan</b> or <b>-s</b>, however it will also perform a low level rescan  to  pick
              up  other  devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may cause the
              OS to re-enumerate them.  Use this option when a device is plugged in  and  not  discovered  in  a
              normal  scan.   NOTE:  A  low-level  rescan may not be available on all interfaces or all OSs. The
              low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional devices in the system  when  the  device  is
              unable to come to a ready state.

       <b>--SATInfo</b>

              Displays  SATA  device  information  on any interface using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported
              data (translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log reported data.

       <b>--testUnitReady</b>

              Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the status. If the  drive  is  not  ready,  the
              sense key, asc, ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable translation from the SPC spec
              will be displayed if one is available.

       <b>--fastDiscovery</b>

       Use this option
              to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.

       <b>--csmiInfo</b>

              Use  this  option  to  show  some information reported by the CSMI compliant driver. This includes
              driver information, controller information, PHY information, SAS address, and  SATA  signature  as
              they  were  reported  by  the  driver.  This  information  can be useful when troubleshooting CSMI
              system/driver compatibility issues.

       <b>--deviceStatistics</b>

              Use this option to display the device statistics reported by the device. On SATA,  this  uses  the
              Device  Statistics  log,  and the notifications log (if DSN feature is supported) to display these
              statistics. On SAS, various  log  pages  are  read  to  collect  a  bunch  of  reported  parameter
              information.

       <b>--showConcurrentRanges</b>

              Use  this  option  to  display the concurrent positioning ranges supported by a device. Concurrent
              positioning ranges are used to inform which actuator is used for a given range in LBA space.

       <b>--partitionInfo</b>

              Use this option to look for a partition table and dump the list of partitions  on  a  given  disk.
              Currently only MBR and GPT partition tables are supported.

              SATA Only: ========= <b>--showPhyEvents</b> (SATA Only)

              Use this option to display a SATA device's supported event counters.

       <b>--smartAttributes</b> [raw | hybrid | analyzed]
              (SATA Only)

              The drive will display its list of supported SMART attributes.  Some attributes names are commonly
              standard  and  most  others are vendor unique. In either case, the attribute thresholds are always
              vendor unique. Most attributes are informational and not used to determine a warranty return.  Use
              the  <b>--smartCheck</b> command to determine if one of the warranty attributes has been tripped. Seagate
              Support does not help to analyze SMART attributes.  Output modes:

              raw - All hex output for those that need every single bit.  hybrid - classic table view with  some
              interpretation of some

       fields. Partial raw interpretation, but not all drive
              and firmware combinations are supported.

       analyzed - a full breakdown of all parts of each individual
              attribute's data. Full raw data interpretation only available on select devices.

              NOTE: Migration to device statistics is recommended.

              SAS  Only:  ========= <b>--defectFormat</b> [ # | shortBlock | longBlock | xbfi | xchs | bfi | chs ] (SAS
              Only)

              This option set the format of the defects to output.  Not  all  drives  will  support  all  defect
              modes!  SSDs will only support block modes!  Arguments: (name | #)

              shortBlock  | 0 - show the defects in short block address mode (drives &lt; 32bit LBA) xbfi       | 1
              - show the defects in extended bytes from index mode xchs       | 2 - show the defects in extended
              physical cylinder-head-sector mode longBlock  | 3 - show the defects in long  block  address  mode
              (drives  &gt;  32bit LBA) bfi        | 4 - show the defects in bytes from index mode chs        | 5 -
              show the defects in physical cylinder-head-sector mode

       <b>--showSCSIDefects</b> [ p | g | pg ]
              (SAS Only)

              This option will display the SCSI defects on the screen.  The arguments to this will tell  whether
              to  get  the  grown, primary, or primary and grown defects from the drive.  Use the <b>--defectFormat</b>
              option to  specify  the  mode  to  display  the  defects.   If  no  mode  is  specified,  physical
              cylinder-head-sector mode is assumed Arguments:

              p  - use this option to pull and display the primary (factory) defects g - use this option to pull
              and display the grown (reallocated) defects

              The above options can be combined to pull and display both defect lists.
