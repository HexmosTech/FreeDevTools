       Utility Options ===============

       <b>--csmiIgnorePort</b> (Obsolete)

              This option is obsolete and will be removed in future versions.

       <b>--csmiUsePort</b> (Obsolete)

              This option is obsolete and will be removed in future versions.

       <b>--csmiVerbose</b> (Obsolete)

              This option is obsolete and will be removed in future versions.

       <b>--echoCommandLine</b>

              Echo the command line entered into the utility on the screen.

       <b>--enableLegacyUSBPassthrough</b>

              Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products that do not  otherwise  work  with
              the  tool.   This  option  will  enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various ATA
              Identify commands through vendor specific means.  Because  of  this,  certain  products  that  may
              respond  in  unintended  ways  since they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
              chip the command was designed for.

       <b>--forceATA</b>

              Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as a ATA  drive.  Only  ATA  commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>--forceATADMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using  this  option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the protocol set
              to DMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAPIO</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to  ATA  device  when  possible.  This
              option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAUDMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using  this  option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the protocol set
              to UDMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceSCSI</b>

              Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as a SCSI drive. Only  SCSI  commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>

              Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now) Please report bugs/suggestions to
              <a href="mailto:seaboard@seagate.com">seaboard@seagate.com</a>.  Include the output of <b>--version</b> information in the email.

       <b>--license</b>

              Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

       <b>--modelMatch</b> [model Number]

              Use  this option to run on all drives matching the provided model number. This option will provide
              a closest match although an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001

       <b>--newFW</b> [firmware revision]

              Use this option to skip drives matching the provided firmware revision. This option will  only  do
              an  exact  match.   This option should be used to skip performing an update if a drive already has
              this firmware revision loaded.

       <b>--noBanner</b>

              Use this option to suppress the text banner that displays each time openSeaChest is run.

       <b>--onlyFW</b> [firmware revision]

              Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided firmware  revision.  This  option  will
              only do an exact match.

       <b>--onlySeagate</b>

              Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options provided

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>

              Run openSeaChest_Firmware in quiet mode. This is the same as <b>-v</b> 0 or <b>--verbose</b> 0

       <b>-v</b> [0-4], <b>--verbose</b> [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]

              Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are: 0 - quiet 1 - default 2 - command descriptions 3 -
              command  descriptions  and values 4 - command descriptions, values, and data buffers Example: <b>-v</b> 3

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>

              Show openSeaChest_Firmware version and copyright information &amp; exit

       Utility Arguments =================

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--device</b> [deviceHandle | all]

              Use this option with most commands to specify the device handle on which to perform an  operation.
              Example:  /dev/sg&lt;#&gt;  CSMI  device  handles can be specified as &lt;error&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&gt; To run across all
              devices detected in the system, use the "all" argument instead of a device  handle.   Example:  <b>-d</b>
              all NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the

       specified options on each drive detected in the
              OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please use a script opening a separate instance for each
              device handle.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--scanFlags</b> [option list]

              Use  this  option  to control the output from scan with the options listed below. Multiple options
              can be combined.

       ata - show only ATA (SATA) devices
              usb - show only USB devices scsi - show only SCSI (SAS) devices nvme  -  show  only  NVMe  devices
              interfaceATA  -  show  devices  on an ATA interface interfaceUSB - show devices on a USB interface
              interfaceSCSI - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface interfaceNVME = show devices  on  an  NVMe
              interface sd - show sd device handles sgtosd - show the sd and sg device handle mapping ignoreCSMI
              - do not scan for any CSMI devices allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD handles

              to show up multiple times in the list

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--deviceInfo</b>

              Show information and features for the storage device

       <b>--llInfo</b>

              Dump low-level information about the device to assist with debugging.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--scan</b>

              Scan  the  system  and  list all storage devices with logical /dev/sg&lt;#&gt; assignments. Shows model,
              serial and firmware numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately  after  booting,
              then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--Scan</b>

              This  option  is the same as <b>--scan</b> or <b>-s</b>, however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick
              up other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may  cause  the
              OS  to  re-enumerate  them.   Use  this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a
              normal scan.  NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all  interfaces  or  all  OSs.  The
              low-level  rescan  is  not  guaranteed to find additional devices in the system when the device is
              unable to come to a ready state.

       <b>--SATInfo</b>

              Displays SATA device information on any interface using both SCSI Inquiry /  VPD  /  Log  reported
              data (translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log reported data.

       <b>--testUnitReady</b>

              Issues  a  SCSI  Test  Unit  Ready command and displays the status. If the drive is not ready, the
              sense key, asc, ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable translation from the SPC spec
              will be displayed if one is available.

       <b>--fastDiscovery</b>

       Use this option
              to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.

       <b>--activateFW</b>

              Use this option to issue the command to activate code that was sent to the drive using a  deferred
              download  command.  This  will  immediately  activate the new code on the drive.  You can use this
              along with a <b>--downloadFW</b> &amp; <b>--downloadMode</b> to automatically issue the activate command  after  the
              download has completed.

       WARNING: Firmware activation may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--downloadFW</b> [firmware_filename]

              Download  firmware  to a Seagate storage product. Use only device manufacturer authorized firmware
              data files which are designated for the specific model drive. Improper use of this option may harm
              a device and or its data. You may specify the path (without spaces) if the firmware data  file  is
              in  a  different  location.   This  option  will  use  segmented  download  by  default.  Use  the
              <b>--downloadMode</b> option to specify a different download mode.

       WARNING: Firmware updates may affect all LUNs/namespaces
              for devices with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--downloadMode</b> [ auto | full | segmented | deferred | deferred+activate ]

              Use this option along with the <b>--downloadFW</b> option to set the firmware download  mode.   Supported
              Modes:

       auto - automatically determines the best mode to use to
              perform the firmware update.

       full - performs a download in one large
              transfer to the device.

       segmented - downloads the firmware in multiple
              segments to the device. (Most compatible)

       deferred - performs a segmented download to the
              device, but does not activate the new firmware until a powercycle or activate command is sent.

       deferred+activate - performs a deferred download and
              automatically acitvates it for you.  Similar to how a segmented download works but uses a separate
              activate  command.  This is the recommended mode that "auto" will select when possible for maximum
              compatibility with Windows 10 and later operating systems.

       WARNING: Firmware Updates may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--firmwareSlot</b>/--fwBufferID slot#

              Use this option to specify  a  firmware  slot  (NVMe)  or  a  buffer  ID  (SCSI)  along  with  the
              <b>--downloadMode</b>  (SCSI) or <b>--activateFW</b> (NVMe &amp; SCSI) options.  If this option is not used, a value
              of zero will be used instead, which means the drive will automatically select the slot number.

       <b>--fwdlInfo</b>

              Use this option to show the firmware download support information for a drive.

       <b>--showLockedRegions</b>

              This option should only be used when performing firmware updates on  legacy  products.  What  this
              does is it ignores a failing error code from the OS on the final segment of a firmware update, but
              this update is actually successful.  This is needed to workaround hardware or firmware limitations
              that were present in some old products.

       <b>--fwdlSegSize</b> [segment size in 512B blocks]

              Use  this  option  to  specify  a  segment  size in 512B blocks to use for a segmented or deferred
              download. This option will not affect an immediate download (full buffer at  once).   The  default
              segment size used is 64. Larger segment sizes may be faster, however they may also be incompatible
              with  controllers  or  drivers in the system. Smaller values are more likely to be compatible, but
              also slower.  Use this option if the default used  by  the  tool  is  not  working  correctly  for
              firmware updates.

       <b>--switchFW</b>
              (NVMe Only)

              Use  this  option to switch to a different firmware slot on an NVMe drive. You must specify a slot
              with the <b>--firmwareSlot</b> option or this will fail. The specified slot must  already  have  a  valid
              firmware image in it as well.

       WARNING: Switching firmware may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.
