              Only  use  this  option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products that do not otherwise work with
              the tool.  This option will enable a trial and error method  that  attempts  sending  various  ATA
              Identify  commands  through  vendor  specific  means.  Because  of this, certain products that may
              respond in unintended ways since they may interpret these commands  differently  than  the  bridge
              chip the command was designed for.

       <b>--forceATA</b>

              Using  this  option  will  force the current drive to be treated as a ATA drive. Only ATA commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>--forceATADMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the  protocol  set
              to DMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAPIO</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using  this  option  will  force  the tool to issue PIO commands to ATA device when possible. This
              option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAUDMA</b>

       Utility Arguments =================

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--device</b> [deviceHandle | all]

              Use  this option with most commands to specify the device handle on which to perform an operation.
              Example: /dev/sg&lt;#&gt; CSMI device handles can be specified as &lt;error&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&gt;  To  run  across  all
              devices  detected  in  the system, use the "all" argument instead of a device handle.  Example: <b>-d</b>
              all NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the

       specified options on each drive detected in the
              OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please use a script opening a separate instance for each
              device handle.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--scanFlags</b> [option list]

              Use this option to control the output from scan with the options listed  below.  Multiple  options
              can be combined.

       ata - show only ATA (SATA) devices
              usb  -  show  only  USB  devices scsi - show only SCSI (SAS) devices nvme - show only NVMe devices
              interfaceATA - show devices on an ATA interface interfaceUSB - show devices  on  a  USB  interface
              interfaceSCSI  -  show  devices on a SCSI or SAS interface interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe
              interface sd - show sd device handles sgtosd - show the sd and sg device handle mapping ignoreCSMI
              - do not scan for any CSMI devices allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD handles

              to show up multiple times in the list

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--deviceInfo</b>

              Show information and features for the storage device

       <b>--llInfo</b>

              Dump low-level information about the device to assist with debugging.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--scan</b>

              Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical  /dev/sg&lt;#&gt;  assignments.  Shows  model,
              serial  and  firmware numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately after booting,
              then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--Scan</b>

              This option is the same as <b>--scan</b> or <b>-s</b>, however it will also perform a low level rescan  to  pick
              up  other  devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may cause the
              OS to re-enumerate them.  Use this option when a device is plugged in  and  not  discovered  in  a
              normal  scan.   NOTE:  A  low-level  rescan may not be available on all interfaces or all OSs. The
              low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional devices in the system  when  the  device  is
              unable to come to a ready state.

       <b>--SATInfo</b>

              Displays  SATA  device  information  on any interface using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported
              data (translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log reported data.

       <b>--testUnitReady</b>

              Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the status. If the  drive  is  not  ready,  the
              sense key, asc, ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable translation from the SPC spec
              will be displayed if one is available.

       <b>--fastDiscovery</b>

       Use this option
              to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.

       <b>--checkPowerMode</b>

              Get  the  current  power  mode  of a drive.  On SCSI devices, this will only work if the drive has
              transitioned from active state to another state.

       <b>--EPCfeature</b> [enable | disable]

              Enables or disables Extended Power Conditions (EPC)  support  for  devices.  To  disable  EPC  use
              <b>--EPCfeature</b>  disable.  Note  that  the  EPC  Feature  Set  is  not supported on all devices.  Use
              <b>--deviceInfo</b> option to see if EPC is supported.

       WARNING: The EPC settings may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--idle_a</b> [ enable | disable | default | timerValueMilliseconds ]

       Use this setting to change the EPC Idle_A power mode settings.

       <b>--powerMeasurementMode</b> [all | 5 | 12]
              (Seagate Only)

              Use this option along with <b>--requestPowerMeasurement</b> to specify which sources to measure power  on
              for the requested time.

              all - measure all power sources 5   - measure only the 5v power 12  - measure only the 12v power

       <b>--requestPowerMeasurement</b> [seconds to perform measurement]
              (Seagate Only)

              This  option is used to specify a time to perform a power measurement for. The minimum measurement
              time is 22 seconds and the maximum is 65535 seconds. If a time less than 22 seconds  is  provided,
              22  seconds  will  be used by the drive. A value greater than 65535 will result in error.  Use the
              <b>--powerMeasurementMode</b> option to specify which mode to measure.

       <b>--powerBalanceFeature</b> [ info | enable | disable | limited]
              (Seagate Only)

              Use this option to see the state of the Seagate Power Balance feature  or  to  change  its  state.
              Seagate's  PowerBalance  feature  will adjust drive performance during random operations to reduce
              power consumption of the drive.

              info - will dump the state of the Power Balance feature on the screen enable - use this to  enable
              Power  Balance  (lowest  power  consumption)  disable - use this to disable Power Balance (hihgest
              power consumption) limited - 12w limited mode. Dual actuator SATA only

              Note: While this  feature  is  available  on  some  SAS  products,  it  is  recommended  that  the
              <b>--setPowerConsumption</b>  option is used instead since it allows more levels of control.  This option
              and the <b>--setPowerConsumption</b> option are incompatible because they use the same mode  page  fields
              (1Ah-01h).

       WARNING: Seagate Power Balance may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--showEPCSettings</b>

              Use  this  option  to show the current EPC settings on the screen.  Only drives supporting the EPC
              feature will show this data and only supported power conditions will be shown.

       <b>--showPowerTelemetry</b>
              (Seagate Only)

              Use this option to show the power telemetry data from a Seagate  drive  that  supports  the  power
              telemetry  feature If a measurement was not previously requested, this will show free-running mode
              data from the last 10 minutes.  If this option  is  provided  while  a  measurement  is  still  in
              progress,  this  will  show all data that is currently available Use the <b>--requestPowerMeasurement</b>
              option to request a power measurement with a set time window.

       NOTE: Power measurements are for the full device, not individual
              logical units. All logical units will be measured for this data.

       <b>--spinDown</b>

              Removes power to the disk drive motor with the Standby Immediate command. Use this before moving a
              hard disk drive. The drive will spin back up if the operating  system  selects  the  drive.   This
              means that an active drive will not stay spun down.

       WARNING: Spindown may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--standby</b> [ enable | disable | default | timerValueMilliseconds ] (Some settings are SAS only)

              Use  this  setting  to  change  the standby power mode settings.  NOTE: This is the legacy standby
              timer before EPC drives.

       If this is used on an EPC drive, this will modify
              the standby_z power state and timer values.

       enable - enable the power state    (SAS Only)

       disable - disable the power state
              (SAS Only)

       timerValue - number of milliseconds to set for the timer
              used in this power state. If a timer is provided the state will also be enabled, if  not  already.
              Spec  timers  are  set  in  100  millisecond  increments.   Timers  will  be  truncated to fit 100
              millisecond increments.

              ATA drives can only change the standby timer, not disable it.  On ATA drives,  the  standby  timer
              set by this command is volatile and drive defaults are restored on next power cycle.

       WARNING: EPC Settings may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--standby_y</b> [ enable | disable | default | timerValueMilliseconds ]

       spinup - issue the PUIS spinup set features command to spin up

       the device to active/idle state.
              enable   -  enable  the  PUIS feature using setfeatures command disable - disable the PUIS feature
              using setfeatures command

       Note: If this is configured on the drive with a jumper, this
              command will fail.

              Note2: Not all products support this feature.   WARNING:  Before  enabling  this  feature  on  any
              SAS/SATA HBA,

       check the HBA documentation to see if this feature
              is supported by the HBA. Enabling this on an HBA that does not support this feature will cause the
              drive to stop showing up to the host OS or even in the HBA's firmware/BIOS/UEFI configuration.

       <b>--setAPMLevel</b> [1 - 254]
              (SATA Only)

              Use this option to set the APM level of a device.  Valid values are between 1 and 254.

       1 = Minimum power consumption with standby mode
              2-127 = Intermediate power management with standby

       mode   128  =  Minimum  power  consumption  without  standby mode 129-253 = Intermediate power management
              without

       standby mode
              254 = Maximum Performance.

       <b>--showAPMLevel</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Use this option to show the current APM level of a device

              SAS Only: ========= <b>--idle</b> [ enable | disable | default | timerValueMilliseconds ]  (SAS Only)

              Use this setting to change the idle power mode settings.  NOTE: This  is  the  legacy  idle  timer
              before EPC drives.

       If this is used on an EPC drive, this will modify
              the idle_a power state and timer values.

       enable - enable the power state

       disable - disable the power state
              default - restore default settings for this power state timerValue - number of milliseconds to set
              for the timer

       used in this power state. If a timer is provided
              the  state  will  also  be  enabled,  if  not  already.   Spec  timers  are set in 100 millisecond
              increments.  Timers will be truncated to fit 100 millisecond increments.

              This is only available on SAS/SCSI drives as ATA drives did not have a separate configurable  idle
              timer.

       WARNING: EPC Settings may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.
