       Utility Options ===============

       <b>--csmiIgnorePort</b> (Obsolete)

              This option is obsolete and will be removed in future versions.

       <b>--csmiUsePort</b> (Obsolete)

              This option is obsolete and will be removed in future versions.

       <b>--csmiVerbose</b> (Obsolete)

              This option is obsolete and will be removed in future versions.

       <b>--echoCommandLine</b>

              Echo the command line entered into the utility on the screen.

       <b>--enableLegacyUSBPassthrough</b>

              Only  use  this  option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products that do not otherwise work with
              the tool.  This option will enable a trial and error method  that  attempts  sending  various  ATA
              Identify  commands  through  vendor  specific  means.  Because  of this, certain products that may
              respond in unintended ways since they may interpret these commands  differently  than  the  bridge
              chip the command was designed for.

       <b>--forceATA</b>

              Using  this  option  will  force the current drive to be treated as a ATA drive. Only ATA commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>--forceATADMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the  protocol  set
              to DMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAPIO</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using  this  option  will  force  the tool to issue PIO commands to ATA device when possible. This
              option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAUDMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the  protocol  set
              to UDMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceSCSI</b>

              Using  this  option will force the current drive to be treated as a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>

              Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now) Please report bugs/suggestions to
              <a href="mailto:seaboard@seagate.com">seaboard@seagate.com</a>.  Include the output of <b>--version</b> information in the email.

       <b>--license</b>

              Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

       <b>--modelMatch</b> [model Number]

              Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided model number. This option will  provide
              a closest match although an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001

       <b>--onlyFW</b> [firmware revision]

              Use  this  option  to  run on all drives matching the provided firmware revision. This option will
              only do an exact match.

       <b>--noTimeLimit</b>

              Use with utility command arguments which have a built in timeout value.  For  example,  <b>--shortDST</b>
              has  a  10  minute  default timeout. In some cases a good drive may need more time to complete the
              test due to other legitimate system activity.

       <b>--noBanner</b>

              Use this option to suppress the text banner that displays each time openSeaChest is run.

       <b>--onlySeagate</b>

              Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options provided

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>

              Run openSeaChest_SMART in quiet mode. This is the same as <b>-v</b> 0 or <b>--verbose</b> 0

       <b>-v</b> [0-4], <b>--verbose</b> [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]

              Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are: 0 - quiet 1 - default 2 - command descriptions 3 -
              command descriptions and values 4 - command descriptions, values, and data buffers Example:  <b>-v</b>  3
              or <b>--verbose</b> 3

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>

              Show openSeaChest_SMART version and copyright information &amp; exit

       Utility Arguments =================

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--device</b> [deviceHandle | all]

              Use  this option with most commands to specify the device handle on which to perform an operation.
              Example: /dev/sg&lt;#&gt; CSMI device handles can be specified as &lt;error&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&gt;  To  run  across  all
              devices  detected  in  the system, use the "all" argument instead of a device handle.  Example: <b>-d</b>
              all NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the

       specified options on each drive detected in the
              OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please use a script opening a separate instance for each
              device handle.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--scanFlags</b> [option list]

              Use this option to control the output from scan with the options listed  below.  Multiple  options
              can be combined.

       ata - show only ATA (SATA) devices
              usb  -  show  only  USB  devices scsi - show only SCSI (SAS) devices nvme - show only NVMe devices
              interfaceATA - show devices on an ATA interface interfaceUSB - show devices  on  a  USB  interface
              interfaceSCSI  -  show  devices on a SCSI or SAS interface interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe
              interface sd - show sd device handles sgtosd - show the sd and sg device handle mapping ignoreCSMI
              - do not scan for any CSMI devices allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD handles

              to show up multiple times in the list

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--deviceInfo</b>

              Show information and features for the storage device

       <b>--llInfo</b>

              Dump low-level information about the device to assist with debugging.

       <b>--poll</b>

              Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress  until  it  has  completed.   This
              argument does not return to the command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)

       the final test result.
              Full drive procedures will take a

       very long time.
              Used with <b>--sanitize</b>, or <b>--writeSame</b> (SATA).

       <b>--progress</b> [dst, idd]

              Get  the  progress  for  a test that was started quietly without the polling option (default). You
              must specify a test you wish to get progress from. Ex: "--progress dst" or  "--progress  sanitize"
              The progress counts up from 0% to 100%.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--scan</b>

              Scan  the  system  and  list all storage devices with logical /dev/sg&lt;#&gt; assignments. Shows model,
              serial and firmware numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately  after  booting,
              then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--Scan</b>

              This  option  is the same as <b>--scan</b> or <b>-s</b>, however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick
              up other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may  cause  the
              OS  to  re-enumerate  them.   Use  this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a
              normal scan.  NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all  interfaces  or  all  OSs.  The
              low-level  rescan  is  not  guaranteed to find additional devices in the system when the device is
              unable to come to a ready state.

       <b>--SATInfo</b>

              Displays SATA device information on any interface using both SCSI Inquiry /  VPD  /  Log  reported
              data (translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log reported data.

       <b>--testUnitReady</b>

              Issues  a  SCSI  Test  Unit  Ready command and displays the status. If the drive is not ready, the
              sense key, asc, ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable translation from the SPC spec
              will be displayed if one is available.

       <b>--fastDiscovery</b>

       Use this option
              to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.

       <b>--abortDST</b>

              Abort a diagnostic Drive Self Test that is in progress.

       <b>--abortIDD</b> (Seagate Only)

              Abort a Seagate In Drive Diagnostic (IDD) that is in progress.  This may return failure if IDD  is
              not running or has already completed running.

       <b>--captive</b> or <b>--foreground</b>

              Use this option to run a DST operation in captive/foreground mode. This mode may allow a device to
              test more of itself and may be slightly faster than offline/background mode since it does not need
              to  service  additional  command during the test.  When using this mode, the utility must wait the
              entire time for the DST to complete and progress cannot be indicated during this time.

       <b>--conveyanceDST</b>

              Execute a conveyance diagnostic drive self test. A conveyance test can be used to check if a drive
              has incurred handling damage.  This test can take up to 2 minutes  to  complete.  Use  the  <b>--poll</b>
              argument  to make this operation poll for progress until complete.  Use the <b>--progress</b> dst command
              to check on the completion percentage (%) and test result.  NOTE: conveyance DST may  take  longer
              if  there is other disk usage while the DST is running. If the DST takes longer than 10 minutes it
              will automatically be aborted while polling for progress.  To  override  this  behavior,  use  the
              <b>--noTimeLimit</b> option.

       <b>--deviceStatistics</b>

              Use  this  option  to display the device statistics reported by the device. On SATA, this uses the
              Device Statistics log, and the notifications log (if DSN feature is supported)  to  display  these
              statistics.  On  SAS,  various  log  pages  are  read  to  collect  a  bunch of reported parameter
              information.

       <b>--errorLimit</b> [limit in number of LBAs]

              Use this option to specify a different error limit for a user generic or long generic read test or
              DST and Clean. This must be a number of

              logical LBAs to have errors. If a drive has multiple logical sectors  per  physical  sector,  this
              number will

              be adjusted for you to reflect the drive architecture.

       <b>--idd</b> [short | long]
              (Seagate Only)

              Start  an  In  Drive  Diagnostic (IDD) test on a Seagate drive. Not all tests are supported by all
              products. If a selected test is not supported, the utility will return a error code  meaning  "not
              supported".  Short:  Reset and Recalibration test. Be careful running this

              test on the boot device.

       Long:  Reset and Recalibration test and test G list and P list

       Note: the <b>--captive</b> option can be added to run the long test in
              foreground/captive  mode.  This  allows  for  G-list  healing  and  some  additional  checks to be
              performed. This may not work on some products.

       Note: Progress cannot be checked for the first 2 minutes of IDD.
              The drive is busy with the test and is not able  to  respond.   Attempting  to  retrieve  progress
              during  this  time  will  hang  and  may  cause the IDD to abort due to the host issuing resets to
              recover access to the drive.

       <b>--longDST</b>

              Execute a long diagnostic drive self test. This test takes hours to complete.   A  2TB  drive  may
              take  six  (6)  hours to complete. Use with the <b>--poll</b> argument to let SeaChest check for progress
              and print it to the screen until complete.  Use  the  <b>--progress</b>  dst  command  to  check  on  the
              completion  percentage(%)  and test result.  This test stops on the first error. Use <b>--abortDST</b> to
              manually stop the test. SAS drives give status in 1% increments. SATA drives give  status  in  10%
              increments which means more than an hour may elapse between updates on a SATA drive &gt; 2TB.

              If  the <b>--longDST</b> poll option is running and you want to abort the test then you will need to open
              a second terminal window and run the <b>--abortDST</b> command. Otherwise, it  is  safe  to  restart  the
              system  while  long  DST  is  running which also ends the test.  NOTE: Long DST may take longer if
              there is other disk usage while the DST is running. If the DST takes  longer  than  5x  the  drive
              reported  time,  it  will  automatically  be aborted while polling for progress.  To override this
              behavior, use the--noTimeLimit option.

       <b>--shortDST</b>

              Execute a short diagnostic drive self test. This test can take up to 2 minutes  to  complete.  Use
              the  <b>--poll</b>  argument  to make this operation poll for progress until complete. Use the <b>--progress</b>
              dst command to check on the completion percentage (%) and test result.  NOTE: Short DST  may  take
              longer  if  there  is  other  disk usage while the DST is running. If the DST takes longer than 10
              minutes it will automatically be aborted while polling for progress.  To override  this  behavior,
              use the <b>--noTimeLimit</b> option.

       <b>--showDSTLog</b>

              This  option  will  show the entries in the DST log.  Up to 21 entries may be shown (pending drive
              support) and will be shown with the most recent entry first.

       <b>--smartCheck</b>

              Perform a SMART check on a device to see if any internal thresholds have been tripped  or  if  the
              drive is still operating within specification.

       <b>--smartFeature</b> [ enable | disable ]
              (SATA Only)

              Use  this  option  to  enable or disable the SMART feature on a SATA drive.  Note: This command is
              declared obsolete in ACS4.

              SATA Only: ========= <b>--smartAttributes</b> [raw | hybrid | analyzed]     (SATA Only)

              The drive will display its list of supported SMART attributes.  Some attributes names are commonly
              standard and most others are vendor unique. In either case, the attribute  thresholds  are  always
              vendor  unique. Most attributes are informational and not used to determine a warranty return. Use
              the <b>--smartCheck</b> command to determine if one of the warranty attributes has been tripped.  Seagate
              Support does not help to analyze SMART attributes.  Output modes:

              raw  - All hex output for those that need every single bit.  hybrid - classic table view with some
              interpretation of some

       fields. Partial raw interpretation, but not all drive
              and firmware combinations are supported.

       analyzed - a full breakdown of all parts of each individual
              attribute's data. Full raw data interpretation only available on select devices.

              NOTE: Migration to device statistics is recommended.

       <b>--smartAttributeAutosave</b> [ enable | disable ]
              (SATA Only)

              Use this option to enable or disable SMART attribute  auto-save  on  an  ATA  drive.   Note:  This
              command is declared obsolete in ACS4.

       <b>--smartAutoOffline</b> [ enable | disable ]
              (SATA Only)

              Use this option to enable or disable SMART auto-off-line feature on an ATA drive.

       <b>--shortDST</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Execute  the SMART off-line data collection routine on an ATA drive.  This will run for the amount
              of time the device specifies that this operation will take to complete. Progress updates  are  not
              available while this is running. Some drives allow other commands to be processed and some require
              no  interruption  while  this  routine  completes.   This routine does vendor unique activities to
              update the SMART data and SMART attributes the device reports.  If the SMART auto-off-line feature
              is supported and enabled, then this routine is already running  automatically  in  the  background
              periodically.

       <b>--showSMARTErrorLog</b> [ summary | comprehensive ] (SATA Only)

              This option will display the ATA SMART Error log on the screen.  Use "summary" to view the summary
              SMART  error  log  (last  5  entries)  Use  "comprehensive"  to view all the entires the drive has
              available.  Specifying "comprehensive" will automatically pull the ext error log  on  drives  that
              support 48bit LBAs.  Note: The summary error log will truncate 48bit commands, so some information

              will be missing to describe the operation of certain commands.

       <b>--smartErrorLogFormat</b> [ raw | detailed ]
              (SATA Only)

              Use  this  option  to  change  the  format  of the output from the <b>--showSMARTErrorLog</b> option. The
              default mode is "detailed"

       <b>--smartInfo</b> (SATA Only)

              This option will show SMART information reported by a given device.

              SAS Only: ========= <b>--defectFormat</b> [ # | shortBlock | longBlock | xbfi | xchs | bfi | chs  ]  (SAS
              Only)

              This  option  set  the  format  of  the defects to output.  Not all drives will support all defect
              modes!  SSDs will only support block modes!  Arguments: (name | #)

              shortBlock | 0 - show the defects in short block address mode (drives &lt; 32bit LBA) xbfi       |  1
              - show the defects in extended bytes from index mode xchs       | 2 - show the defects in extended
              physical  cylinder-head-sector  mode  longBlock  | 3 - show the defects in long block address mode
              (drives &gt; 32bit LBA) bfi        | 4 - show the defects in bytes from index mode chs        |  5  -
              show the defects in physical cylinder-head-sector mode

       <b>--setMRIE</b> [ default | 0 - 6 ]
              (SAS Only)

              Use this option to change the MRIE mode on the informational exceptions mode page.

       default - set to the drive default
              0 - disable exception reporting 1 - Asynchronous reporting (obsolete) 2 - Establish unit attention
              condition  3 - Conditionally generate recovered error 4 - Unconditionally generate recovered error
              5 - Generate no sense 6 - Report on request

       WARNING: Changing MRIE may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--showSCSIDefects</b> [ p | g | pg ]
              (SAS Only)

              This option will display the SCSI defects on the screen.  The arguments to this will tell  whether
              to  get  the  grown, primary, or primary and grown defects from the drive.  Use the <b>--defectFormat</b>
              option to  specify  the  mode  to  display  the  defects.   If  no  mode  is  specified,  physical
              cylinder-head-sector mode is assumed Arguments:

              p  - use this option to pull and display the primary (factory) defects g - use this option to pull
              and display the grown (reallocated) defects

              The above options can be combined to pull and display both defect lists.

              NVMe Only: ========= <b>--showNvmeHealth</b>        (NVMe Only)

              The drive will display the NVMe Health log (also called SMART log). All standardized  fields  will
              be printed to the screen for the device.

       Data Destructive Commands =========================

       <b>--dstAndClean</b>

              Runs  DST,  then  checks  for an error and repairs the error if possible. This continues until all
              errors reported by DST are fixed, or when the error limit is reached.  The  default  limit  is  50
              errors.
