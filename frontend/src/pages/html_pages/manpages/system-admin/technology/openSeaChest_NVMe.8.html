       <b>-s</b>, <b>--scan</b>

              Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical  /dev/sg&lt;#&gt;  assignments.  Shows  model,
              serial  and  firmware numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately after booting,
              then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--scanFlags</b> [option list]

              Use this option to control the output from scan with the options listed  below.  Multiple  options
              can be combined.

       ata - show only ATA (SATA) devices
              usb  -  show  only  USB  devices scsi - show only SCSI (SAS) devices nvme - show only NVMe devices
              interfaceATA - show devices on an ATA interface interfaceUSB - show devices  on  a  USB  interface
              interfaceSCSI  -  show  devices on a SCSI or SAS interface interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe
              interface sd - show sd device handles sgtosd - show the sd and sg device handle mapping ignoreCSMI
              - do not scan for any CSMI devices allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD handles

              to show up multiple times in the list

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--device</b> [deviceHandle | all]

              Use this option with most commands to specify the device handle on which to perform an  operation.
              Example:  /dev/sg&lt;#&gt;  CSMI  device  handles can be specified as &lt;error&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&gt; To run across all
              devices detected in the system, use the "all" argument instead of a device  handle.   Example:  <b>-d</b>
              all NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the

       specified options on each drive detected in the
              OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please use a script opening a separate instance for each
              device handle.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--deviceInfo</b>

              Show information and features for the storage device

       <b>--llInfo</b>

              Dump low-level information about the device to assist with debugging.

       <b>--SATInfo</b>

              Displays  SATA  device  information  on any interface using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported
              data (translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log reported data.

       <b>--testUnitReady</b>

              Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the status. If the  drive  is  not  ready,  the
              sense key, asc, ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable translation from the SPC spec
              will be displayed if one is available.

       <b>--fastDiscovery</b>

       Use this option
              to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.

       <b>--activateFW</b>

              Use  this option to issue the command to activate code that was sent to the drive using a deferred
              download command. This will immediately activate the new code on the  drive.   You  can  use  this
              along  with  a <b>--downloadFW</b> &amp; <b>--downloadMode</b> to automatically issue the activate command after the
              download has completed.

       WARNING: Firmware activation may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--checkPowerMode</b>

              Get the current power mode of a drive.  On SCSI devices, this will only  work  if  the  drive  has
              transitioned from active state to another state.

       <b>--transitionPowerState</b> [new power state]
              (NVMe Only)

              Use  this  option  to transition to a specific power state.  WARNING: Transitioning the drive to a
              non-operational power state

       may make the device stop responding. The operating system
              may or may not block this transition. It is recommended to only use this  option  for  operational
              power states

              HINT:

              Use <b>--showNVMPowerStates</b> to view the supported states

       <b>--downloadFW</b> [firmware_filename]

              Download  firmware  to a Seagate storage product. Use only device manufacturer authorized firmware
              data files which are designated for the specific model drive. Improper use of this option may harm
              a device and or its data. You may specify the path (without spaces) if the firmware data  file  is
              in  a  different  location.   This  option  will  use  segmented  download  by  default.  Use  the
              <b>--downloadMode</b> option to specify a different download mode.

       WARNING: Firmware updates may affect all LUNs/namespaces
              for devices with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--downloadMode</b> [ auto | full | segmented | deferred | deferred+activate ]

              Use this option along with the <b>--downloadFW</b> option to set the firmware download  mode.   Supported
              Modes:

       auto - automatically determines the best mode to use to
              perform the firmware update.

       full - performs a download in one large
              transfer to the device.

       segmented - downloads the firmware in multiple
              segments to the device. (Most compatible)

       deferred - performs a segmented download to the
              device, but does not activate the new firmware until a powercycle or activate command is sent.

       deferred+activate - performs a deferred download and
              automatically acitvates it for you.  Similar to how a segmented download works but uses a separate
              activate  command.  This is the recommended mode that "auto" will select when possible for maximum
              compatibility with Windows 10 and later operating systems.

       WARNING: Firmware Updates may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--firmwareSlot</b>/--fwBufferID slot#

              Use this option to specify  a  firmware  slot  (NVMe)  or  a  buffer  ID  (SCSI)  along  with  the
              <b>--downloadMode</b>  (SCSI) or <b>--activateFW</b> (NVMe &amp; SCSI) options.  If this option is not used, a value
              of zero will be used instead, which means the drive will automatically select the slot number.

       <b>--fwdlSegSize</b> [segment size in 512B blocks]

              Use this option to specify a segment size in 512B blocks  to  use  for  a  segmented  or  deferred
              download.  This  option  will not affect an immediate download (full buffer at once).  The default
              segment size used is 64. Larger segment sizes may be faster, however they may also be incompatible
              with controllers or drivers in the system. Smaller values are more likely to  be  compatible,  but
              also  slower.   Use  this  option  if  the  default  used by the tool is not working correctly for
              firmware updates.

       <b>--getFeatures</b>
              [ help | list | # ]

              Use this option to list the NVMe features Supported Modes:

       help   - prints the descriptions of all

       the features
              list  - lists raw values of all mandatory

       features supported by device
              #     - feature number will print the

              humanized details

       <b>--getNvmeLogPage</b>
              [ error | smart | fwSlots | suppCmds | selfTest | # ]

              Use this option to get the NVMe log pages Supported Modes:

       error  - lists the valid entries found in the

       Error Information Log.
              smart   - lists information found in the

       SMART/Health Information Log
              fwSlots - lists currently active Firmware slot

       and Firmware Revision in each slot.
              suppCmds - lists the commands that the controller

       supports and the effects of those commands.
              selfTest - lists the status of any device

       self-test operation in progress
              and the results of the last 20 device self-test operations.

       #      - option to get the log page using

              a number

       <b>--getTelemetry</b> [host | ctrl]

              Use this option to get the NVMe Telemetry data for a device.  Use the  <b>--telemetryDataArea</b>  option
              to control the amount of data collected.

       Supported Modes:
              host - get Host Telemetry ctrl - get Ctrl Telemetry

       <b>--telemetryDataArea</b> [1 | 2 | 3]

              This  is  a  sub-command  which defines the amount of data collected by the <b>--getTelemetry</b> option.
              Data Area 3 is assumed if this option is not used.

              Supported Data Area.  1 - get minimal telemetry data 2 - get telemetry  data  additional  to  data
              area 2 3 - get telemetry data additional to data area 3 (default data area)

       <b>--listSupportedLogs</b>

              Displays a list of all supported logs by this device type.

       <b>--onlyFW</b> [firmware revision]

              Use  this  option  to  run on all drives matching the provided firmware revision. This option will
              only do an exact match.

       <b>--clearPciErr</b>

              Use this option to clear correctable errors.

       <b>--poll</b>

              Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress  until  it  has  completed.   This
              argument does not return to the command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)

       the final test result.
              Full drive procedures will take a

       very long time.
              Used with <b>--sanitize</b>, or <b>--writeSame</b> (SATA).

       <b>--progress</b> [nvmformat]

              Get  the  progress  for  a test that was started quietly without the polling option (default). You
              must specify a test you wish to get progress from. Ex: "--progress dst" or  "--progress  sanitize"
              The progress counts up from 0% to 100%.

       <b>--extSmartLog</b>

              Use this option to Extract the Extended Smart Log Attributes.

       <b>--logMode</b>
              [ raw | binary ]

              Use  this  option  with  others options such as <b>--getNvmeLogPage</b> and <b>--deviceInfo</b> to show a buffer
              output or to create a binary file.  Supported Modes:

       raw    - prints the raw buffer on stdout

       binary - writes data to a file with device
              Serial Number &amp; time stamp

       <b>--tempStats</b>

              Use this option to get the NVMe Temperature Statistics

       <b>--pciStats</b>

              Use this option to get the NVMe PCIe Statistics

       <b>--showNVMPowerStates</b>
              (NVMe Only)

              Use this option to display a device's supported power states.

       <b>--showSupportedFormats</b>

              This option will show the supported formats of a device.  These can be used to change  the  sector
              size  or  used with a format operation. On SAS, this is the supported block lengths and protection
              types VPD page. (SBC4 and later) On SATA, this is the sector configuration log. (ACS4  and  later)
              If the device does not report supported sector sizes, please consult your product manual.

       WARNING: Customer unique firmware may have specific requirements that
              restrict  sector  sizes  on some products. It may not be possible to format/ fast format to common
              sizes like 4K or 512B due to these customer requirements.

       Data Destructive Commands =========================

       <b>--nvmFmtMetadataSet</b> [ xlba | separate ] (NVMe Only)

              Use this option to specify how metadata is transmitted to the host system.  Options:

              xlba - metadata is transferred  as  part  of  the  logical  block  data  separate  -  metadata  is
              transferred as a separate buffer

              Note:  Not  all  devices  support specifying this.  If this option is not provided, the NVM format
              will reuse the current setting.

       <b>--nvmFmtMS</b> [ # of bytes for metadata ]
              (NVMe Only)

              This option is used to specify the length of metadata with a requested  logical  block  size.  The
              device  must support the combination of logical block size and metadata size or the format will be
              rejected by the device.

       <b>--nvmFmtNSID</b> [all | current]
              (NVMe Only)

              This option changes the NSID used when issuing the NVM format command. This can be used to control
              formatting an entire device or a specific namespace if the  device  supports  specifying  specific
              namespaces  for  a  format  command.  Not all devices support this behavior. This has no effect on
              devices that do not support targeting a specific namespace and will format the  entire  device  If
              this option is not given, the format will be issued to all namespaces by default.

       <b>--nvmFmtPI</b> [ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 ]
              (NVMe Only)

              Use  this  option to specify the protection type to format the medium with.  Note: Not all devices
              support protection types.  If this option is not provided, the NVM format will reuse  the  current
              setting.

       <b>--nvmFmtPIL</b> [ beginning | end ] (NVMe Only)

              Use this option to specify the location protection information in an NVM device's metadata.  Note:
              Not  all  devices  support  specifying  this.  If this option is not provided, the NVM format will
              reuse the current setting.

       <b>--nvmFmtSecErase</b> [none | user | crypto] (NVMe Only)
              (None | Clear | Clear, Possible Purge)

              This option is used to specify the type of erase to perform during an NVM  format  operation.  All
              user  data  will  be inaccessible upon completion of an NVM format, no matter the erase requested.
              Options:

       none - no secure erase requested (previous data will not be accessible,
              however the media may not have been erased by the controller.)

              user - requests all user data is erased by the device. (Clear) crypto - requests  a  cryptographic
              erase of all user data. Note: this mode

       <b>--nvmFormat</b> [current | format # | sector size]
              (NVMe Only)

              This option is used to start an NVM format operation.  Use "current" to perform a format operation
              with  the  Sector size currently being used.  If a value between 0 and 15 is given, then that will
              issue the NVM format with the specified sector size/metadata size for that supported format on the
              drive.  Values 512 and higher will be treated as a new sector  size  to  switch  to  and  will  be
              matched  to an appropriate lba format supported by the drive.  This command will erase all data on
              the drive.  Combine this option with--poll to poll for progress until the format is  complete.   A
              data  sanitization  compliant  with  IEEE  2883  Clear  requires the <b>--nvmFmtSecErase</b> option to be
              provided. Without this option the controller may not erase all user data and substitute  returning
              zeroes for performance instead.
