       <b>--enableLegacyUSBPassthrough</b>

              Only  use  this  option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products that do not otherwise work with
              the tool.  This option will enable a trial and error method  that  attempts  sending  various  ATA
              Identify  commands  through  vendor  specific  means.  Because  of this, certain products that may
              respond in unintended ways since they may interpret these commands  differently  than  the  bridge
              chip the command was designed for.

       <b>--forceATA</b>

              Using  this  option  will  force the current drive to be treated as a ATA drive. Only ATA commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>--forceATADMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the  protocol  set
              to DMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAPIO</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using  this  option  will  force  the tool to issue PIO commands to ATA device when possible. This
              option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAUDMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the  protocol  set
              to UDMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceSCSI</b>

              Using  this  option will force the current drive to be treated as a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>

              Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now) Please report bugs/suggestions to
              <a href="mailto:seaboard@seagate.com">seaboard@seagate.com</a>.  Include the output of <b>--version</b> information in the email.

       <b>--hideLBACounter</b>

              Use this option to suppress the output from options that show LBA counters without turning off all
              output to the screen.

       Utility Arguments =================

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--scan</b>

              Scan  the  system  and  list all storage devices with logical /dev/sg&lt;#&gt; assignments. Shows model,
              serial and firmware numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately  after  booting,
              then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--scanFlags</b> [option list]

              Use  this  option  to control the output from scan with the options listed below. Multiple options
              can be combined.

       ata - show only ATA (SATA) devices
              usb - show only USB devices scsi - show only SCSI (SAS) devices nvme  -  show  only  NVMe  devices
              interfaceATA  -  show  devices  on an ATA interface interfaceUSB - show devices on a USB interface
              interfaceSCSI - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface interfaceNVME = show devices  on  an  NVMe
              interface sd - show sd device handles sgtosd - show the sd and sg device handle mapping ignoreCSMI
              - do not scan for any CSMI devices allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD handles

              to show up multiple times in the list

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--Scan</b>

              This  option  is the same as <b>--scan</b> or <b>-s</b>, however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick
              up other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may  cause  the
              OS  to  re-enumerate  them.   Use  this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a
              normal scan.  NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all  interfaces  or  all  OSs.  The
              low-level  rescan  is  not  guaranteed to find additional devices in the system when the device is
              unable to come to a ready state.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--device</b> [deviceHandle | all]

              Use this option with most commands to specify the device handle on which to perform an  operation.
              Example:  /dev/sg&lt;#&gt;  CSMI  device  handles can be specified as &lt;error&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&gt; To run across all
              devices detected in the system, use the "all" argument instead of a device  handle.   Example:  <b>-d</b>
              all NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the

       specified options on each drive detected in the
              OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please use a script opening a separate instance for each
              device handle.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--deviceInfo</b>

              Show information and features for the storage device

       <b>--llInfo</b>

              Dump low-level information about the device to assist with debugging.

       <b>--SATInfo</b>

              Displays  SATA  device  information  on any interface using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported
              data (translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log reported data.

       <b>--testUnitReady</b>

              Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the status. If the  drive  is  not  ready,  the
              sense key, asc, ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable translation from the SPC spec
              will be displayed if one is available.

       <b>--fastDiscovery</b>

       Use this option
              to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.

       <b>--capacityModelNumberMapping</b>

              Use this option to display the capacity model number mapping TBD

       <b>--changeIdString</b>

              Use  this  option  to  change  ID string according to capacity - model number mapping. Need to use
              together with <b>--setMaxLBA</b> or <b>--restoreMaxLBA</b>

       <b>--checkPowerMode</b>

              Get the current power mode of a drive.  On SCSI devices, this will only  work  if  the  drive  has
              transitioned from active state to another state.

       <b>--displayLBA</b> [LBA]

              This  option  will  read  and display the contents of the specified LBA to the screen. The display
              format is hexadecimal with an ASCII translation on the side (when available).

       <b>--activateFW</b>

              Use this option to issue the command to activate code that was sent to the drive using a  deferred
              download  command.  This  will  immediately  activate the new code on the drive.  You can use this
              along with a <b>--downloadFW</b> &amp; <b>--downloadMode</b> to automatically issue the activate command  after  the
              download has completed.

       WARNING: Firmware activation may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--downloadFW</b> [firmware_filename]

              Download  firmware  to a Seagate storage product. Use only device manufacturer authorized firmware
              data files which are designated for the specific model drive. Improper use of this option may harm
              a device and or its data. You may specify the path (without spaces) if the firmware data  file  is
              in  a  different  location.   This  option  will  use  segmented  download  by  default.  Use  the
              <b>--downloadMode</b> option to specify a different download mode.

       WARNING: Firmware updates may affect all LUNs/namespaces
              for devices with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--downloadMode</b> [ auto | full | segmented | deferred | deferred+activate ]

              Use this option along with the <b>--downloadFW</b> option to set the firmware download  mode.   Supported
              Modes:

       auto - automatically determines the best mode to use to
              perform the firmware update.

       full - performs a download in one large
              transfer to the device.

       segmented - downloads the firmware in multiple
              segments to the device. (Most compatible)

       deferred - performs a segmented download to the
              device, but does not activate the new firmware until a powercycle or activate command is sent.

       deferred+activate - performs a deferred download and
              automatically acitvates it for you.  Similar to how a segmented download works but uses a separate
              activate  command.  This is the recommended mode that "auto" will select when possible for maximum
              compatibility with Windows 10 and later operating systems.

       WARNING: Firmware Updates may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--showLockedRegions</b>

              This option should only be used when performing firmware updates on  legacy  products.  What  this
              does is it ignores a failing error code from the OS on the final segment of a firmware update, but
              this update is actually successful.  This is needed to workaround hardware or firmware limitations
              that were present in some old products.

       <b>--shortDST</b>

              Execute  a  short  diagnostic drive self test. This test can take up to 2 minutes to complete. Use
              the <b>--poll</b> argument to make this operation poll for progress until complete.  Use  the  <b>--progress</b>
              dst  command  to check on the completion percentage (%) and test result.  NOTE: Short DST may take
              longer if there is other disk usage while the DST is running. If the  DST  takes  longer  than  10
              minutes  it  will automatically be aborted while polling for progress.  To override this behavior,
              use the <b>--noTimeLimit</b> option.

       <b>--poll</b>

              Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress  until  it  has  completed.   This
              argument does not return to the command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)

       the final test result.
              Full drive procedures will take a

       very long time.
              Used with <b>--sanitize</b>, or <b>--writeSame</b> (SATA).

       <b>--progress</b> [dst]

              Get  the  progress  for  a test that was started quietly without the polling option (default). You
              must specify a test you wish to get progress from. Ex: "--progress dst" or  "--progress  sanitize"
              The progress counts up from 0% to 100%.

       <b>--abortDST</b>

              Abort a diagnostic Drive Self Test that is in progress.

       <b>--phySpeed</b> [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5]

              Use  this  option to change the PHY speed to a new maximum value. On SAS, this option will set all
              phys to the specified speed unless the <b>--sasPhy</b> option is given to select a  specific  phy.   0  -
              allow  full  negotiation  (default  drive  behavior) 1 - allow negotiation up to 1.5Gb/s 2 - allow
              negotiation up to 3.0Gb/s 3 - allow negotiation up to 6.0Gb/s 4 - allow negotiation up to 12.0Gb/s
              (SAS Only) 5 - allow negotiation up to 22.5Gb/s (SAS Only)

              NOTE: SATA phy speed changes are only available on Seagate drives.

       WARNING: Check the minimum phy speed supported by your adapter before
              using this option. A phy speed below the adapter's capability will result in the drive  not  being
              seen by the adapter or the OS.

       WARNING: Changing Phy speed may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--readLookAhead</b> [info | enable | disable]

              Use  this  option to enable or disable read look-ahead support on a drive. Use the "info" argument
              to get the current status of the read look ahead feature.

       WARNING: Changing Read look-ahead may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--restoreMaxLBA</b>

              Restore the max accessible address of your drive to its native size. A  power  cycle  is  required
              after this command before setting a new max LBA.

       <b>--setMaxLBA</b> newMaxLBA

              Set  the  max  accessible address of your drive to any value less than the device's default native
              size. A power cycle is required after this command before resetting or setting a new max LBA.

       <b>--showConcurrentRanges</b>

              Use this option to display the concurrent positioning ranges supported  by  a  device.  Concurrent
              positioning ranges are used to inform which actuator is used for a given range in LBA space.

       <b>--smartCheck</b>

              Perform  a  SMART  check on a device to see if any internal thresholds have been tripped or if the
              drive is still operating within specification.

       <b>--spinDown</b>

              Removes power to the disk drive motor with the Standby Immediate command. Use this before moving a
              hard disk drive. The drive will spin back up if the operating  system  selects  the  drive.   This
              means that an active drive will not stay spun down.

       WARNING: Spindown may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--writeCache</b> [info | enable | disable]

              Use  this  option  to enable or disable write cache support on a drive. Use the "info" argument to
              get the current status of the write cache feature.

       WARNING: Changing Write Cache may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

              SATA Only: ========= <b>--smartAttributes</b> [raw | hybrid | analyzed]     (SATA Only)

              The drive will display its list of supported SMART attributes.  Some attributes names are commonly
              standard and most others are vendor unique. In either case, the attribute  thresholds  are  always
              vendor  unique. Most attributes are informational and not used to determine a warranty return. Use
              the <b>--smartCheck</b> command to determine if one of the warranty attributes has been tripped.  Seagate
              Support does not help to analyze SMART attributes.  Output modes:

              raw  - All hex output for those that need every single bit.  hybrid - classic table view with some
              interpretation of some

       fields. Partial raw interpretation, but not all drive
              and firmware combinations are supported.

       analyzed - a full breakdown of all parts of each individual
              attribute's data. Full raw data interpretation only available on select devices.

              NOTE: Migration to device statistics is recommended.

              SAS Only: ========= <b>--readyLED</b> [info | on | off | default] (SAS Only)

              Use this option to get the current state or change the behavior of the ready  LED.   See  the  SPL
              spec for full details on how this changes LED

       info - gets the current state of the ready LED.
              on - sets the ready LED to usually off unless

       processing a command.
              off - sets the ready LED to usually on unless

       processing a command
              default - sets the ready LED to the drive's default value

       WARNING: The EPC settings may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--sasPhy</b> [phy number] (SAS Only)

              Use  this  option  to specify a specific phy to use with another option that uses a phy identifier
              value.  Some tool options will assume all SAS Phys when this option is not  present.  Others  will
              produce  an error when a specific phy is needed for an operation.  Use the <b>-i</b> option to learn more
              about the supported phys.

       Data Destructive Commands =========================

       <b>--overwrite</b> [starting LBA]
              (Clear)

              Use this option to start an overwrite erase at the specified starting  LBA.  Combine  this  option
              with overwriteRange or time options (hours, minutes seconds) to erase a portion of the drive.

       <b>--overwriteRange</b> [range in # of LBAs]
              (Clear)

              Use with the overwrite option (<b>--overwrite</b>) to erase a range of LBAs on the selected drive.

       <b>--provision</b> newMaxLBA

              Provision your drive to a new max LBA to any value less than the device's current max LBA. A power
              cycle  is  required  after  this command before resetting the max LBA or changing the provisioning
              again. This command erases all data between the new maxLBA specified and the current maxLBA of the
              device.  using a TRIM/UNMAP command.

       <b>--trim</b> or <b>--unmap</b> [starting LBA]

              Use one of these options to start a trim or unmap operation on a drive at  the  provided  LBA.   A
              range must also be provided with the range option.

       <b>--trimRange</b> or <b>--unmapRange</b> [range in # of LBAs]

              Use  one of these options to specify a range to trim or unmap on a drive. A starting point must be
              specified with the <b>--trim</b>/--unmapRange option.
