       <b>--echoCommandLine</b>

              Echo the command line entered into the utility on the screen.

       <b>--enableLegacyUSBPassthrough</b>

              Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products that do not  otherwise  work  with
              the  tool.   This  option  will  enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various ATA
              Identify commands through vendor specific means.  Because  of  this,  certain  products  that  may
              respond  in  unintended  ways  since they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
              chip the command was designed for.

       <b>--forceATA</b>

              Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as a ATA  drive.  Only  ATA  commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>--forceATADMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using  this  option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the protocol set
              to DMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAPIO</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to  ATA  device  when  possible.  This
              option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAUDMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using  this  option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the protocol set
              to UDMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceSCSI</b>

              Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as a SCSI drive. Only  SCSI  commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       Utility Arguments =================

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--device</b> [deviceHandle | all]

              Use this option with most commands to specify the device handle on which to perform an  operation.
              Example:  /dev/sg&lt;#&gt;  CSMI  device  handles can be specified as &lt;error&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&gt; To run across all
              devices detected in the system, use the "all" argument instead of a device  handle.   Example:  <b>-d</b>
              all NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the

       specified options on each drive detected in the
              OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please use a script opening a separate instance for each
              device handle.

       <b>--displayLBA</b> [LBA]

              This  option  will  read  and display the contents of the specified LBA to the screen. The display
              format is hexadecimal with an ASCII translation on the side (when available).

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--scanFlags</b> [option list]

              Use this option to control the output from scan with the options listed  below.  Multiple  options
              can be combined.

       ata - show only ATA (SATA) devices
              usb  -  show  only  USB  devices scsi - show only SCSI (SAS) devices nvme - show only NVMe devices
              interfaceATA - show devices on an ATA interface interfaceUSB - show devices  on  a  USB  interface
              interfaceSCSI  -  show  devices on a SCSI or SAS interface interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe
              interface sd - show sd device handles sgtosd - show the sd and sg device handle mapping ignoreCSMI
              - do not scan for any CSMI devices allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD handles

              to show up multiple times in the list

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--deviceInfo</b>

              Show information and features for the storage device

       <b>--llInfo</b>

              Dump low-level information about the device to assist with debugging.

       <b>--poll</b>

              Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress  until  it  has  completed.   This
              argument does not return to the command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)

       the final test result.
              Full drive procedures will take a

       very long time.
              Used with <b>--sanitize</b>, or <b>--writeSame</b> (SATA).

       <b>--progress</b> [sanitize | format | nvmformat]

              Get  the  progress  for  a test that was started quietly without the polling option (default). You
              must specify a test you wish to get progress from. Ex: "--progress dst" or  "--progress  sanitize"
              The progress counts up from 0% to 100%.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--scan</b>

              Scan  the  system  and  list all storage devices with logical /dev/sg&lt;#&gt; assignments. Shows model,
              serial and firmware numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately  after  booting,
              then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--Scan</b>

              This  option  is the same as <b>--scan</b> or <b>-s</b>, however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick
              up other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may  cause  the
              OS  to  re-enumerate  them.   Use  this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a
              normal scan.  NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all  interfaces  or  all  OSs.  The
              low-level  rescan  is  not  guaranteed to find additional devices in the system when the device is
              unable to come to a ready state.

       <b>--SATInfo</b>

              Displays SATA device information on any interface using both SCSI Inquiry /  VPD  /  Log  reported
              data (translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log reported data.

       <b>--testUnitReady</b>

              Issues  a  SCSI  Test  Unit  Ready command and displays the status. If the drive is not ready, the
              sense key, asc, ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable translation from the SPC spec
              will be displayed if one is available.

       <b>--fastDiscovery</b>

       Use this option
              to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.

       <b>--hours</b> [hours]

              Use this option to specify a time in hours for a timed operation to run.

       <b>--minutes</b> [minutes]

              Use this option to specify a time in minutes for a timed operation to run.

       <b>--seconds</b> [seconds]

              Use this option to specify a time in seconds for a timed operation to run.

       <b>--eraseRestoreMaxPrep</b>

              This option will attempt to restore the max LBA to the highest user addressable  sector  prior  to
              beginning  a  drive  erasure.   If  any failure is encountered while restoring the maxLBA, then an
              error will be indicated and  the  erase  will  not  be  started  or  attempted  until  other  user
              intervention  can  be  completed.  If a feature is frozen, locked, or has already been used during
              the current power cycle, then these things can cause a failure.  The solution is  to  power  cycle
              the  drive,  but  in  some  cases  it  may  be necessary to try a different computer or adapter as
              commands may be blocked by the system or automatically issued  by  the  BIOS  to  lock  access  to
              capacity  changing  commands.   This  option  will  handle the ATA HPA (Host Protected Area), AMAC
              (Accessible Max Address Configuration), HPA Security  Extension,  and  DCO  (Device  Configuration
              Overlay)  features in accordance with the specifications.  If the restore completes without error,
              then the erase will proceed and additional errors will  only  be  in  relation  to  those  erasure
              methods.

       <b>--refreshfs</b>

              This  option  will  call an OS unique low-level routine to rescan a device for any file systems it
              can detect through the  partition  table.  The  detected  filesystems  will  vary  by  OS  and  OS
              capabilities.   This  option is useful to call after completing a full disk erase as it may make a
              cached volume in the OS go away or detect that a device is empty and ready  to  have  a  new  file
              system written to it.

       <b>--showEraseSupport</b>

              This  option  checks  the drive to determine which methods of data erasure are supported and lists
              them, from fastest to slowest.

       WARNING: Some erase methods may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--zeroVerify</b> [full | quick]

              Use this option to verify drive content, whether it's set to zero or  not.   This  operation  will
              read  user  accessible address and validate if content at that address is zero or not.  Validation
              modes:

              full - Complete drive will be scanned for verification.  quick - 0.1% of total  capacity  will  be
              scanned for ID and OD validation along with

              2 random addresses from 10000 equal size sections each.

              SATA Only: ========= <b>--ataSATsecurityProtocol</b> [enable | disable]             (SATA only)

              This option can be used to force enable or disable using the ATA security protocol as specified in
              the  SAT  specification.   By default, the tool will use this method when it is supported to allow
              the SATL to understand and manage the security commands being performed and prevent other issues.

       <b>--ataSecPassword</b> ["ASCII password" | SeaChest | empty]
              (SATA only)

              Use this option to specify a password to use with an  ATA  security  operation.  If  specifying  a
              password  with  spaces,  quotes must be used.  If SeaChest is given, the default SeaChest password
              will be used.  If empty is given, an empty password will be used.  Examples:

              "This is a valid password" ThisIsAlsoValid  "This  password  uses  \"quotes\"  "This  password  is
              \/\/eird"

       <b>--ataSecPassType</b> [user | master]
              (SATA only)

              Use  this option to specify if the password being given with the <b>--ataSecPassword</b> option is a user
              or a master password.  If this option is not provided, user is assumed.

       <b>--ataSecPWMod</b> [byteswapped | zeropad | spacepad | fpad | leftAlign | rightAlign | uppercase | lowercase |
              invertcase] (SATA Only)

              Use this option to have the utility make modifications to the ATA  security  password  to  attempt
              other various ways it may be sent by a system bios. These are not guaranteed to work, but may help
              unlock  a  drive that was locked by a BIOS that encoded the password in a unique way.  This option
              can be presented multiple times to select multiple modificaitons.  EX:  <b>--ataSecPWMod</b>  byteswapped
              <b>--ataSecPWMod</b> invertcase

              byteswapped  -  byteswaps  the password. EX: blah -&gt; lbha zeropad - zero pads the password if less
              than 32 characters spacepad - space pads the password if less than 32 characters fpad -  pads  the
              passwords  with Fh (all 1's) if less than 32characters leftAlign - left aligns the password in the
              buffer rightAlign - right aligns the password in the buffer uppercase - sends the password as  all
              uppercase  lowercase  -  sends  the  password as all lowercase invertcase - switches uppercase for
              lower, and lowercase for upper

       Data Destructive Commands ========================= Data sanitization capabilities:

       Recommendation - Restore the MaxLBA of the device prior to any erase in
              order to allow the drive to erase all  user  addressable  sectors.  For  ATA  devices  this  means
              restoring  HPA  +  DCO  /  AMAC  to  restore  the  maxLBA.   Restoring the MaxLBA also allows full
              verification of all user addressable space on the device without a limitation from a lower maxLBA.

              Clear - Logical techniques are applied to all addressable storage

              locations, protecting against simple, non-invasive data recovery techniques.

              Clear, Possible Purge - Cryptographic erase is a purge if the vendor

              implementation meets the requirements in IEEE 2883-2022.

              Purge - Logical techniques that target user data, overprovisioning,

              unused space, and bad  blocks  rendering  data  recovery  infeasible  even  with  state-of-the-art
              laboratory techniques.

       This  utility  does  not  support  clear/purge  verification yet. All labels are written according to the
       expectation that the device firmware will meet these capabilities as defined in the appropriate standards
       from T10, T13, SATA - IO, and NVMexpress.  =========================

       <b>--ause</b>

              Use this option to allow running a sanitize operation in unrestricted mode. Without  this  option,
              all  sanitize  options are run in restricted mode by default.  In unrestricted mode, if a sanitize
              erase fails the drive enters a failure state. The failure state can be  cleared  with  a  Sanitize
              exit  failure  mode command, or it can be cleared with a successful sanitize erase.  In restricted
              mode, if a sanitize fails, the failure state can only be cleared with a successful sanitize erase.

       <b>--ipbp</b>

              Use this option to instruct the drive to invert the requested sanitize overwrite  pattern  between
              each overwrite pass.  For the default pattern of all zeroes, this means that after a first pass of
              zeroes, the second pass will be all 1's (binary) or all F's (hexadecimal)

       <b>--overwrite</b> [starting LBA]
              (Clear)

              Use  this  option  to  start an overwrite erase at the specified starting LBA. Combine this option
              with overwriteRange or time options (hours, minutes seconds) to erase a portion of the drive.

       <b>--overwriteRange</b> [range in # of LBAs]
              (Clear)

              Use with the overwrite option (<b>--overwrite</b>) to erase a range of LBAs on the selected drive.

       <b>--overwritepasses</b> [ number of overwrite passes ]

              Specify the number of overwrite passes to use during a sanitize overwrite operation.  By  default,
              only  a single overwrite pass is used unless this option specifies a different value.  The maximum
              number of passes varies by drive type: ATA:  16 passes NVMe: 16 passes SCSI:  31  passes  Use  the
              <b>--ipbp</b> option to instruct the device to invert the pattern between each overwrite pass.

       <b>--pattern</b> [repeat:asciinospaces | random | increment:startValue | file:filename]

              Use  this  option with overwrite, sanitize, and format unit operations to write a specific pattern
              to a range of LBAs or the whole drive.

              * repeat - without spaces, enter an ASCII text string or a  hexadecimal  string  terminated  by  a
              lower  case  "h".  This  pattern will be repeated until it fills the logical size of the LBA. i.e.
              helloword or FFFFFFFFh Note: A hexadecimal  pattern  will  be  interpreted  as  a  32bit  unsigned
              integer.  4  hex  bytes  (8 characters) must be given for a hex value to be used. Ex: 1F037AC8h or
              0000FFFFh * random - the entire logical sector size will be filled with random bytes.This  pattern
              will  be  written  to  all  LBAs in the desired range.  * increment - enter the starting numerical
              value. Starting with this value, each byte will be written with 1 + previous value.  * file - user
              supplied file name to use for a pattern. The file will be truncated or padded with  zeros  to  the
              logical  sector  size Note 1: Each file will be interpreted as a binary file.  Note 2: A path must
              also be provided if the file is not in the

              local directory.

       Note 3: Sanitize Overwrite on SATA only supports a 32bit pattern.
              The file option will get truncated to a 32bit pattern for SATA products.

       <b>--performQuickestErase</b>

              This option checks the drive to  determine  which  methods  of  data  erasure  are  supported  and
              determines  which  is  the  quickest  to  erase ALL data on the drive. It then starts the quickest
              erase. Combine this option with the <b>--poll</b> option to enable polling for progress  on  the  fastest
              erase.   Note:  Some erase methods require polling and will have polling enabled by default.  Note
              2: If revertSP is the fastest, it will not be started since the drive PSID must be  passed  in  on
              the command line.

       WARNING: Some erase methods may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       <b>--sanitize</b> [info | blockerase | cryptoerase |
              overwrite | freezelock | antifreezelock]    (Purge)

              Use  the  info  argument  to  show  supported  sanitize  operations.   Optionally, use blockerase,
              cryptoerase, or overwrite to start a sanitize operation.  Adding  the  <b>--poll</b>  option  will  cause
              openSeaChest_Erase  to poll the drive for progress until the operation is complete, or has aborted
              for some reason. All sanitize erase operations are persistent across a power cycle and  cannot  be
              stopped Example: <b>--sanitize</b> blockerase <b>--poll</b>

              By  default, sanitize runs in restricted exit mode, meaning the only way to exit a failed sanitize
              is to attempt sanitize again until it completes successfully. Add the  <b>--ause</b>  option  to  run  in
              unrestricted  mode.  In unrestricted mode, if sanitize fails you can exit this mode with the "exit
              failure mode" command or a successful sanitize command.

              For Zoned block devices, the <b>--znr</b> option can be used to stop the write  pointers  from  resetting
              allowing full drive verification to be performed upon completion of sanitize For NVMe devices that
              support  the  deallocate  feature  (TRIM),  the  <b>--nodeallocate</b>  option can be used to prevent the
              deallocation of blocks at completion of sanitize to allow for full drive verification.   NOTE:  An
              NVMe controller may inhibit the no deallocate behavior

       and may deallocate anyways or fail the sanitize command when
              no deallocate is specified.

              * blockerase on some solid state drives is very fast at less than one (1) second, while others may
              take  more  that  30 seconds This operation performs a physical low level block erase operation on
              all current, past, and potential user data.  The contents on  user  data  are  indeterminate  upon
              completion.

              *  cryptoerase  is  very fast at less than one (1) second. It changes the internal encryption keys
              that are used for user data causing all previous data to be useless.

              * overwrite is a physical overwrite on all current, past, and potential user data. The ATA,  NVMe,
              &amp;  SCSI  specifications  allow a user defined pattern and multiple passes. openSeaChest_Erase will
              use a zero pattern and a single pass for this operation  by  default.  Use  <b>--overwritepasses</b>  and
              <b>--ipbp</b>  to  specify  the number of passes and whether to invert the pattern between each overwrite
              pass.

       <b>--trim</b> or <b>--unmap</b> [starting LBA]

              Use one of these options to start a trim or unmap operation on a drive at  the  provided  LBA.   A
              range must also be provided with the range option.

       <b>--trimRange</b> or <b>--unmapRange</b> [range in # of LBAs]

              Use  one of these options to specify a range to trim or unmap on a drive. A starting point must be
              specified with the <b>--trim</b>/--unmapRange option.

       <b>--writeSame</b> [starting LBA]
              (Clear)

              Enter a starting lba to begin a write same on to erase a range of  data  on  the  drive.  On  SCSI
              devices,  this  uses the writesame16 command. On ATA devices, this uses the SCT writesame feature.
              Combine this option with the writeSameRange option to select the range. This operation will  write
              0's  to  the  device  for the specified range. For SATA drives, this option will poll for progress
              until the write same has completed. SAS/SCSI drives will hold the tool busy until the  write  same
              has  completed  without  progress  indication  since  this  is  not  possible  on  SAS/SCSI due to
              specification limitations on how write same was defined.  On SATA, if any other commands are  sent
              to  the  drive  while  it's  performing  a  write  same, the write same will be aborted.  NOTE: On
              SAS/SCSI drives this command is optional. Additionally,

       the range may be limited to much less than the full device
              size. Due to the history of this command, there is not a great  way  to  confirm  support  in  all
              cases.  Some  ranges  will  be  too  large, and some devices may or may not allow writing the full
              medium in a single command. If you wish to write an entire device, consider  a  different  command
              such as format unit or sanitize overwrite to accomplish this.

       <b>--writeSameRange</b> [range in # of LBAs]

              Specify  a  range  to  writesame to. Use this option with the writeSame option in order to begin a
              write same operation.

       <b>--znr</b>

              For ZBD's (Zoned Block Devices), use this option during  a  Sanitize  or  ATA  Security  Erase  to
              specify  leaving  all zones full so that full verification of erasure can be performed.  When this
              option is not specified, all zones will be empty upon completion of these erases.

              SATA Only: ========= <b>--ataSecureErase</b> [normal | enhanced]    (SATA only)     (Clear | Purge)

              Use "normal" to start a standard ATA security erase (Clear) or "enhanced" to start an enhanced ATA
              security erase (Purge).

              ATA Security Erase takes a very long time  to  complete  at  approximately  three  (3)  hours  per
              Tera-byte (HDD). Some Seagate SED models will perform a quick cryptographic erase in enhanced mode
              and  the  time  for  completion is reported as 2 minutes by the drive, but will take only seconds.
              This industry standard command begins by locking the drive with  a  temporary  password  which  is
              cleared  at the end of the erasure. Do not run this command unless you have ample time to allow it
              to run through to the end. If the procedure is interrupted prior to  completion,  then  the  drive
              will  remain  in  a  locked state and you must manually restart from the beginning again. The tool
              will attempt to automatically clear the password that was set upon failure. The  default  password
              used by the tool is "SeaChest", plain ASCII letters without the quotes

              * normal writes binary zeros (0) or ones (1) to all user data areas.

              * enhanced will fill all user data areas and reallocated user data with a vendor specific pattern.
              Some Seagate Instant Secure Erase will perform a cryptographic erase instead of an overwrite.

       <b>--sanitizeAntiFreeze</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Antifreezelock  is  a  command that is designed to block a freezelock command from locking out the
              sanitize feature set.  It is only available  on  ATA  drives  that  support  the  ACS3,  or  newer
              specification.

       <b>--sanitizeFreeze</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Freezelock  is  a  command  to  block  processing  of  sanitize  operations until a power cycle is
              performed on a device.  It is only available on ATA drives. Once this command has been  sent,  the
              freezelock  status  becomes  immediate and cannot be cleared until the drive has been powered off.
              All sanitize commands, except a sanitize status will be aborted.

              SAS Only: ========= <b>--fastFormat</b> [fast format mode] (SAS Only) (SBC4 required)

              Use this option with the <b>--formatUnit</b> option to run a  fast  format.   Changing  sector  sizes  is
              intended  for supported Seagate products used in some hardware RAID configurations. Please consult
              your hardware RAID documentation for information about compatibility and using 4K  native  sectors
              before using this option!  Software RAID or individual/JBOD drive solutions will see no benefit as
              modern  file  systems  and  modern  operating  systems  are already 4K aware even on 512 emulation
              drives. Modern operating systems already align file systems to 4K  boundaries  required  by  these
              drives  for  optimal  performance.   Performing a sector size change is data destructive and has a
              risk that the adapter, driver, or operating system may not know how to communicate with the device
              once this has completed.

       [49m[38;5;9m          There is an additional risk when performing a low-level fast format that may

              NVMe Only: ========= <b>--nodeallocate</b>  (NVMe Only)

              For NVMe devices, specify this option during a sanitize to leave  all  blocks  allocated  after  a
              sanitize  erase.  By  default an NVMe controller will deallocate (TRIM/Unmap) all the LBAs.  Using
              this option allows for full verification of erasure after  a  Sanitize  command.   NOTE:  An  NVMe
              controller  may  inhibit  this option in certain configurations meaning the sanitize may produce a
              warning or a failure depending on how this is configured on the controller.   After  verifying  an
              erasure  with  this  option,  run  a  deallocate/TRIM  across the entire device/namespace to match

       <b>--nvmFmtMetadataSet</b> [ xlba | separate ] (NVMe Only)

              Use this option to specify how metadata is transmitted to the host system.  Options:

              xlba - metadata is transferred  as  part  of  the  logical  block  data  separate  -  metadata  is
              transferred as a separate buffer

              Note:  Not  all  devices  support specifying this.  If this option is not provided, the NVM format
              will reuse the current setting.

       <b>--nvmFmtMS</b> [ # of bytes for metadata ]
              (NVMe Only)

              This option is used to specify the length of metadata with a requested  logical  block  size.  The
              device  must support the combination of logical block size and metadata size or the format will be
              rejected by the device.

       <b>--nvmFmtNSID</b> [all | current]
              (NVMe Only)

              This option changes the NSID used when issuing the NVM format command. This can be used to control
              formatting an entire device or a specific namespace if the  device  supports  specifying  specific
              namespaces  for  a  format  command.  Not all devices support this behavior. This has no effect on
              devices that do not support targeting a specific namespace and will format the  entire  device  If
              this option is not given, the format will be issued to all namespaces by default.

       <b>--nvmFmtPI</b> [ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 ]
              (NVMe Only)

              Use  this  option to specify the protection type to format the medium with.  Note: Not all devices
              support protection types.  If this option is not provided, the NVM format will reuse  the  current
              setting.

       <b>--nvmFmtPIL</b> [ beginning | end ] (NVMe Only)

              Use this option to specify the location protection information in an NVM device's metadata.  Note:
              Not  all  devices  support  specifying  this.  If this option is not provided, the NVM format will
              reuse the current setting.

       <b>--nvmFmtSecErase</b> [none | user | crypto] (NVMe Only)
              (None | Clear | Clear, Possible Purge)

              This option is used to specify the type of erase to perform during an NVM  format  operation.  All
              user  data  will  be inaccessible upon completion of an NVM format, no matter the erase requested.
              Options:

       none - no secure erase requested (previous data will not be accessible,
              however the media may not have been erased by the controller.)

              user - requests all user data is erased by the device. (Clear) crypto - requests  a  cryptographic
              erase of all user data. Note: this mode

              is not supported on all devices. (Clear, Possible Purge)

       <b>--nvmFormat</b> [current | format # | sector size]
              (NVMe Only)

              This option is used to start an NVM format operation.  Use "current" to perform a format operation
              with  the  Sector size currently being used.  If a value between 0 and 15 is given, then that will
              issue the NVM format with the specified sector size/metadata size for that supported format on the
              drive.  Values 512 and higher will be treated as a new sector  size  to  switch  to  and  will  be
              matched  to an appropriate lba format supported by the drive.  This command will erase all data on
              the drive.  Combine this option with--poll to poll for progress until the format is  complete.   A
              data  sanitization  compliant  with  IEEE  2883  Clear  requires the <b>--nvmFmtSecErase</b> option to be
              provided. Without this option the controller may not erase all user data and substitute  returning
              zeroes for performance instead.
