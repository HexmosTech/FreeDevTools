       Utility Options ===============

       <b>--csmiIgnorePort</b> (Obsolete)

              This option is obsolete and will be removed in future versions.

       <b>--csmiUsePort</b> (Obsolete)

              This option is obsolete and will be removed in future versions.

       <b>--csmiVerbose</b> (Obsolete)

              This option is obsolete and will be removed in future versions.

       <b>--echoCommandLine</b>

              Echo the command line entered into the utility on the screen.

       <b>--enableLegacyUSBPassthrough</b>

              Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products that do not  otherwise  work  with
              the  tool.   This  option  will  enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various ATA
              Identify commands through vendor specific means.  Because  of  this,  certain  products  that  may
              respond  in  unintended  ways  since they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
              chip the command was designed for.

       <b>--forceATA</b>

              Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as a ATA  drive.  Only  ATA  commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>--forceATADMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using  this  option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the protocol set
              to DMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAPIO</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to  ATA  device  when  possible.  This
              option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAUDMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using  this  option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the protocol set
              to UDMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceSCSI</b>

              Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as a SCSI drive. Only  SCSI  commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>

              Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now) Please report bugs/suggestions to
              <a href="mailto:seaboard@seagate.com">seaboard@seagate.com</a>.  Include the output of <b>--version</b> information in the email.

       <b>--license</b>

       Utility Arguments =================

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--device</b> [deviceHandle | all]

              Use this option with most commands to specify the device handle on which to perform an  operation.
              Example:  /dev/sg&lt;#&gt;  CSMI  device  handles can be specified as &lt;error&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&gt; To run across all
              devices detected in the system, use the "all" argument instead of a device  handle.   Example:  <b>-d</b>
              all NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the

       specified options on each drive detected in the
              OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please use a script opening a separate instance for each
              device handle.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--scanFlags</b> [option list]

              Use  this  option  to control the output from scan with the options listed below. Multiple options
              can be combined.

       ata - show only ATA (SATA) devices
              usb - show only USB devices scsi - show only SCSI (SAS) devices nvme  -  show  only  NVMe  devices
              interfaceATA  -  show  devices  on an ATA interface interfaceUSB - show devices on a USB interface
              interfaceSCSI - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface interfaceNVME = show devices  on  an  NVMe
              interface sd - show sd device handles sgtosd - show the sd and sg device handle mapping ignoreCSMI
              - do not scan for any CSMI devices allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD handles

              to show up multiple times in the list

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--deviceInfo</b>

              Show information and features for the storage device

       <b>--llInfo</b>

              Dump low-level information about the device to assist with debugging.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--scan</b>

              Scan  the  system  and  list all storage devices with logical /dev/sg&lt;#&gt; assignments. Shows model,
              serial and firmware numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately  after  booting,
              then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--Scan</b>

              This  option  is the same as <b>--scan</b> or <b>-s</b>, however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick
              up other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may  cause  the
              OS  to  re-enumerate  them.   Use  this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a
              normal scan.  NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all  interfaces  or  all  OSs.  The
              low-level  rescan  is  not  guaranteed to find additional devices in the system when the device is
              unable to come to a ready state.

       <b>--SATInfo</b>

              Displays SATA device information on any interface using both SCSI Inquiry /  VPD  /  Log  reported
              data (translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log reported data.

       <b>--testUnitReady</b>

              Issues  a  SCSI  Test  Unit  Ready command and displays the status. If the drive is not ready, the
              sense key, asc, ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable translation from the SPC spec
              will be displayed if one is available.

       <b>--fastDiscovery</b>

       Use this option
              to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.

       <b>--ptDriveHint</b> [ata | nvme]

              This option passes a hint to the software that the device being tested is an ATA or NVMe drive  so
              it can appropriately test it.  This option is most useful when also using <b>--ptTypeHint</b>

       <b>--ptTypeHint</b> [sat | legacyATA]

              Add  this  option if the device being tested is likely to support one of the supported passthrough
              types. This hints to the software to perform additional testing for these passthroughs if no other
              support is apparent.

       sat - device supports SAT ATA-passthrough commands (12 or 16 byte)
              legacyATA - device supports a legacy vendor unique method to passthrough

       ATA commands. You must also specify <b>--enableLegacyATAPTTest</b>
              in order for these commands to be tested.

       <b>--disablePassthroughTesting</b>

              Disables all ATA passthrough testing. Device will only be tested with SCSI commands from  SPC  and
              SBC specifications.

       <b>--enableLegacyATAPTTest</b>

              Add this option to the command line to allow sending legacy passthrough CDBs from old USB adapters
              or drivers. By default these are off since these operation codes may perform unintended actions on
              devices  that  don't  actually  support  passthrough.  For example: There is a USB thumbdrive that
              receives one of these and bricks immediately.  Only add this to the command line if you understand
              and have high confidence that the device you are  testing  is  likely  to  support  one  of  these
              passthroughs.  Most  of  these  devices will have been created prior to 2006 when the SAT spec was
              added for a standardized passthrough.

       <b>--enableHangCmdsTest</b> [all | zlr | sctgpl | rrTdir]

              There are some commands that are known to cause some translators to hang when they  are  received.
              This  option  covers some known commands for some devices This must be enabled manually for a more
              complete test, but if it hangs the device could  cause  problems.   Each  of  these  tests  has  a
              specific  hack/quirk  related to it, so if the device hangs, then it must be added to the list for
              higher compatibility. Not all hangs will be able to be detected by the software!  Put this  option
              on the command line multiple times to add different combinations of tests.

       all - run all known commands that may cause hangs
              zlr - do SCSI read commands with zero transfer length sctgpl - try reading the SCT status log with
              a  GPL  read  log  ext  command  rrTdir  - in the SAT return response information protocol, run it
              without setting the tdir bit as the spec allows

       <b>--forceRetest</b>

              Use this option to force this utility to retest this device if  it  reports  that  it  is  already
              known. This may be useful when testing multiple devices that use the same chip and are identified,
              or when trying to troubleshoot compatibility on another OS.

       <b>--runPTTest</b>

              This option is used to perform the passthrough test.  The passthrough test is an attempt to figure
              out  quirks  or  hacks with different translators in order to make the device more compatible with
              the rest of the openSeaChest software.  The default test is done using only what can be determined
              about the device from the SCSI reported data. Attempting to passthrough ATA or NVMe  commands  may
              not  be  done  depending  on  how  the device reports.  Using the other options can help tell this
              software to test for other behavior. The other options to control the test are as follows:

       <b>--ptDriveHint</b>
              <b>--ptTypeHint</b>     <b>--disablePassthroughTesting</b>     <b>--enableLegacyATAPTTest</b>      <b>--enableHangCmdsTest</b>
              <b>--forceRetest</b>
