       Utility Arguments =================

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--device</b> [deviceHandle | all]

              Use this option with most commands to specify the device handle on which to perform an  operation.
              Example:  /dev/sg&lt;#&gt;  CSMI  device  handles can be specified as &lt;error&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&gt; To run across all
              devices detected in the system, use the "all" argument instead of a device  handle.   Example:  <b>-d</b>
              all NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the

       specified options on each drive detected in the
              OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please use a script opening a separate instance for each
              device handle.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--scanFlags</b> [option list]

              Use  this  option  to control the output from scan with the options listed below. Multiple options
              can be combined.

              interfaceATA  -  show  devices  on an ATA interface interfaceUSB - show devices on a USB interface
              interfaceSCSI - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface interfaceNVME = show devices  on  an  NVMe
              interface sd - show sd device handles sgtosd - show the sd and sg device handle mapping ignoreCSMI
              - do not scan for any CSMI devices allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD handles

              to show up multiple times in the list

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--deviceInfo</b>

              Show information and features for the storage device

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--scan</b>

              Scan  the  system  and  list all storage devices with logical /dev/sg&lt;#&gt; assignments. Shows model,
              serial and firmware numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately  after  booting,
              then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--Scan</b>

              This  option  is the same as <b>--scan</b> or <b>-s</b>, however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick
              up other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may  cause  the
              OS  to  re-enumerate  them.   Use  this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a
              normal scan.  NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all  interfaces  or  all  OSs.  The
              low-level  rescan  is  not  guaranteed to find additional devices in the system when the device is
              unable to come to a ready state.

       <b>--SATInfo</b>

              Displays SATA device information on any interface using both SCSI Inquiry /  VPD  /  Log  reported
              data (translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log reported data.

       <b>--testUnitReady</b>

              Issues  a  SCSI  Test  Unit  Ready command and displays the status. If the drive is not ready, the
              sense key, asc, ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable translation from the SPC spec
              will be displayed if one is available.

       <b>--fastDiscovery</b>

       Use this option
              to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.

       <b>--dataDir</b> [in | out | none]

              Use this option to specify the data direction of the entered raw command.  in - transfer data from
              the device to host out - transfer data from the host to device none - no data is transferred

       <b>--dataLen</b> [length in bytes]

              Use this option to specify the data transfer length for  a  data-in  or  data-out  transfer.   The
              following post fixes are allowed for specifying a transfer length:

       BLOCKS - used to specify a transfer length
              in device logical blocks. (Preferred)

       KB - length in kilobytes (val * 1000)
              KiB  -  length  in kibibytes (val * 1024) MB - length in megabytes (val * 1000000) MiB - length in
              mebibytes (val * 1048576)

              You must enter a size that is greater than or equal to any length in the entered raw command data.
              If a lesser value is entered, then the utility may experience errors or crash.

       <b>--inputFile</b> [path/filename]

              Use this option to specify an input file to send to a device. Must be a binary file.

       <b>--inputOffset</b> [offset in bytes]

              Use this option to specify the offset within the raw input file to start sending data  from.   The
              following post fixes are allowed for specifying a transfer length:

       BLOCKS - used to specify an offset length
              in device logical blocks. (Preferred)

       KB - length in kilobytes (val * 1000)
              KiB  -  length  in kibibytes (val * 1024) MB - length in megabytes (val * 1000000) MiB - length in

       <b>--outputFile</b> [path/filename]

              Use this option to specify an output file to save data returned from a command, or in the case  of
              an  error,  the  returned  error  buffer.   This option will always append data to already created
              files. If an error occurs on a datain raw command, the returned error data will not be saved to  a
              file to prevent adding unexpected data to the created file.

       <b>--timeout</b> [time in seconds]

              Use this option to specify an timeout in seconds for a raw command being sent to a device.

              NOTE: All read/write commands should use "logical", all other data transfers should use 512

       <b>--tfrProtocol</b> [pio | dma | udma | fpdma | ncq | nodata | reset | dmaque | diag] (SATA Only)

              Use this option to specify the protocol for sending a raw SATA command. This option must match the
              definition  of  the  command  in the ATA/ACS specification.  This option must be provided before a
              command will be sent.  Arguments:

              pio - send as programmed IO protocol.  dma - send as direct memory access protocol udma - send  as
              ultra  direct memory access protocol fpdma/ncq - send as first party direct memory access protocol
              (NCQ) nodata - send as non-data protocol reset - send as reset protocol (ATAPI only) dmaque - send
              as direct memory access queued protocol (TCQ) diag - send as devie diagnostic protocol

              NOTE: If a command with dma doesn't work, try udma. Some SATLs like it better.  NOTE:  Most  SATLs
              don't allow sending queued commands as pass-through. Some OSs

              also will not allow queued pass-through commands.

       <b>--tfrSetChkCond</b> (SATA Only)

              Use  this option to set the check condition bit in the SAT CDB that may be sent to a translator to
              inform it to generate a check condition and return all task file results.  NOTE: This  option  may
              not work on all SATLs.

       <b>--tfrSize</b> [28 | 48 | complete]
              (SATA Only)

              Use  this option to specify the command type: 28bit or 48bit when issuing a raw SATA command. This
              option must match the definition of the command in the ATA/ACS specification.  This option must be
              provided before a command will be sent.  Arguments:

              28 - the command is a 28 bit command (ex: identify, SMART) 48 - the command is a  48  bit  command
              (ex: read DMA ext, read log ext) complete - 48 bit command that also sets ICC or AUX registers.

       use this to force a 32B CDB. If specifying 48 and AUX or ICC
              are set, 32B CDB will automatically be generated without needing this option explicitly set.

       NOTE: complete TFR requires SAT 32B cdb, which many devices or interfaces
              may not support. These commands may not be available.

       <b>--tfrXferLengthReg</b> [sectorCount | feature | tpsiu | nodata]
              (SATA Only)

              Use this option to specify the registers used to specify the length of data being sent or received
              when  issuing  a  raw  SATA  command.  This option must match the definition of the command in the
              ATA/ACS specification.  This option must be provided before a command will be sent.  Arguments:

              sectorCount - the sector count registers specify the number of blocks (most  commands)  feature  -
              the  feature registers specify the number of blocks (queued commands) tpsiu - a transport specific
              location will specify the length of the data transfer nodata - no data transfer. Used on  non-data
              protocol commands

       NOTE: tpsiu is generally only seen supported on USB adapters, but not all USB SATL's
              will recognize this option.

       NOTE: For commands, such as identify (ECh), that transfer data, but do not specify
              a  value  of  1  in  the  sector  count,  it is recommended that this is added to the sector count
              register and and "sectorCount" is used for better compatibility with various SATLs.

              SAS Only: ========= <b>--cdb</b> [csv CDB]

              Use this option to specify a specific CDB to send to a device. The entered value must be in  comma
              separated value (csv) format. To specify a value as hex, it must be either pre-pended with "0x" or
              post-pended with "h" or "H" Examples:

       1) inquiry: <b>--cdb</b> 12h,0,0,0,60h,0
              2) inquiry: <b>--cdb</b> 0x12,0,0,0,0x60,0 3) inquiry: <b>--cdb</b> 18,0,0,0,96,0

              All 3 examples send the same command to a drive

       <b>--cdbLen</b> [length in bytes]

              Use  this  option  to  specify the length of the CDB to send to the device. Max length is 255 Some
              OS's may not support CDBs larger than 16 bytes
