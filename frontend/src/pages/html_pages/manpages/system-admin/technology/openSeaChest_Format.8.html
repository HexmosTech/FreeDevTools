       Utility Options ===============

       <b>--csmiIgnorePort</b> (Obsolete)

              This option is obsolete and will be removed in future versions.

       <b>--csmiUsePort</b> (Obsolete)

              This option is obsolete and will be removed in future versions.

       <b>--csmiVerbose</b> (Obsolete)

              This option is obsolete and will be removed in future versions.

       <b>--echoCommandLine</b>

              Echo the command line entered into the utility on the screen.

       <b>--enableLegacyUSBPassthrough</b>

              Only  use  this  option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products that do not otherwise work with
              the tool.  This option will enable a trial and error method  that  attempts  sending  various  ATA
              Identify  commands  through  vendor  specific  means.  Because  of this, certain products that may
              respond in unintended ways since they may interpret these commands  differently  than  the  bridge
              chip the command was designed for.

       <b>--force</b>

              Use the <b>--force</b> option to attempt to override and force a specific operation on a drive in case it
              is  returning  "Not  supported"  messages. This can be used to override some checks for command or
              feature support. Be aware that sending unsupported commands may result in command failures, and in
              some circumstances, it may also cause indeterminate behavior of a device.  Do not use this command
              unless you are certain that a device supports the command or feature you are  attempting  to  use.
              This  option  is not guaranteed to make things work or fix issues. This option is not available to
              override every support check or other incompatibility check in the software.

       <b>--forceATA</b>

              Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as a ATA  drive.  Only  ATA  commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>--forceATADMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using  this  option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the protocol set
              to DMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAPIO</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to  ATA  device  when  possible.  This
              option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAUDMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using  this  option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the protocol set
              to UDMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceSCSI</b>

              Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as a SCSI drive. Only  SCSI  commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       Utility Arguments =================

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--device</b> [deviceHandle | all]

              Use this option with most commands to specify the device handle on which to perform an  operation.
              Example:  /dev/sg&lt;#&gt;  CSMI  device  handles can be specified as &lt;error&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&gt; To run across all
              devices detected in the system, use the "all" argument instead of a device  handle.   Example:  <b>-d</b>
              all NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the

       specified options on each drive detected in the
              OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please use a script opening a separate instance for each
              device handle.

       <b>--displayLBA</b> [LBA]

              This  option  will  read  and display the contents of the specified LBA to the screen. The display
              format is hexadecimal with an ASCII translation on the side (when available).

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--scanFlags</b> [option list]

              Use this option to control the output from scan with the options listed  below.  Multiple  options
              can be combined.

       ata - show only ATA (SATA) devices
              usb  -  show  only  USB  devices scsi - show only SCSI (SAS) devices nvme - show only NVMe devices
              interfaceATA - show devices on an ATA interface interfaceUSB - show devices  on  a  USB  interface
              interfaceSCSI  -  show  devices on a SCSI or SAS interface interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe
              interface sd - show sd device handles sgtosd - show the sd and sg device handle mapping ignoreCSMI
              - do not scan for any CSMI devices allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD handles

              to show up multiple times in the list

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--deviceInfo</b>

              Show information and features for the storage device

       <b>--llInfo</b>

              Dump low-level information about the device to assist with debugging.

       <b>--poll</b>

              Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress  until  it  has  completed.   This
              argument does not return to the command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)

       the final test result.
              Full drive procedures will take a

       very long time.
              Used with <b>--sanitize</b>, or <b>--writeSame</b> (SATA).

       <b>--progress</b> [format | nvmformat | depop | repop]

              Get  the  progress  for  a test that was started quietly without the polling option (default). You
              must specify a test you wish to get progress from. Ex: "--progress dst" or  "--progress  sanitize"
              The progress counts up from 0% to 100%.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--scan</b>

              Scan  the  system  and  list all storage devices with logical /dev/sg&lt;#&gt; assignments. Shows model,
              serial and firmware numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately  after  booting,
              then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--Scan</b>

              This  option  is the same as <b>--scan</b> or <b>-s</b>, however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick
              up other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may  cause  the
              OS  to  re-enumerate  them.   Use  this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a
              normal scan.  NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all  interfaces  or  all  OSs.  The
              low-level  rescan  is  not  guaranteed to find additional devices in the system when the device is
              unable to come to a ready state.

       <b>--SATInfo</b>

              Displays SATA device information on any interface using both SCSI Inquiry /  VPD  /  Log  reported
              data (translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log reported data.

       <b>--testUnitReady</b>

              Issues  a  SCSI  Test  Unit  Ready command and displays the status. If the drive is not ready, the
              sense key, asc, ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable translation from the SPC spec
              will be displayed if one is available.

       <b>--fastDiscovery</b>

       Use this option
              to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.

       <b>--depopulateMaxLBA</b> [requested MaxLBA]

              Use this option to specify a new maximum LBA  when  removing  (depopulating)  a  physical  storage
              element.   This  is  optional. If this is not specified, the device will determine the new maximum
              LBA.  NOTE: If you specify a maximum LBA the device does  not  support,  it  will  not  start  the
              depopulation.

       <b>--showPhysicalElementStatus</b>

              Use  this option to see the status/health of the storage elements inside a drive.  Use the element
              # shown with the <b>--removePhysicalElement</b> option to remove that storage  element  from  use.   This
              option can also be used to see if a depopulation is still in progress or if it has completed.

       <b>--showSupportedFormats</b>

              This  option  will show the supported formats of a device.  These can be used to change the sector
              size or used with a format operation. On SAS, this is the supported block lengths  and  protection
              types  VPD  page. (SBC4 and later) On SATA, this is the sector configuration log. (ACS4 and later)
              If the device does not report supported sector sizes, please consult your product manual.

       WARNING: Customer unique firmware may have specific requirements that
              restrict sector sizes on some products. It may not be possible to format/ fast  format  to  common
              sizes like 4K or 512B due to these customer requirements.

              SAS Only: ========= <b>--showFormatStatusLog</b> (SAS Only)

              Use  this  option  to  view  the  SCSI  format  status  log.  Note: This log is only valid after a
              successful format unit operation.

       Data Destructive Commands =========================

       <b>--pattern</b> [repeat:asciinospaces | random | increment:startValue | file:filename]

              Use this option with overwrite, sanitize, and format unit operations to write a  specific  pattern
              to a range of LBAs or the whole drive.

              *  repeat  -  without  spaces,  enter an ASCII text string or a hexadecimal string terminated by a
              lower case "h". This pattern will be repeated until it fills the logical size  of  the  LBA.  i.e.
              helloword  or  FFFFFFFFh  Note:  A  hexadecimal  pattern  will  be interpreted as a 32bit unsigned
              integer. 4 hex bytes (8 characters) must be given for a hex value to be  used.  Ex:  1F037AC8h  or
              0000FFFFh  * random - the entire logical sector size will be filled with random bytes.This pattern
              will be written to all LBAs in the desired range.  * increment  -  enter  the  starting  numerical
              value. Starting with this value, each byte will be written with 1 + previous value.  * file - user
              supplied  file  name  to use for a pattern. The file will be truncated or padded with zeros to the
              logical sector size Note 1: Each file will be interpreted as a binary file.  Note 2: A  path  must
              also be provided if the file is not in the

              local directory.

       Note 3: Sanitize Overwrite on SATA only supports a 32bit pattern.
              The file option will get truncated to a 32bit pattern for SATA products.

       <b>--removePhysicalElement</b> [element #]

              Use this option to remove a storage element from use on a drive. When this is done, the drive will
              erase  all user data and lower the capacity to a new point where the drive is still usable without
              the provided element #.  Use the <b>--showPhysicalElementStatus</b> option  to  see  the  status  of  the
              depopulation operation.

       [49m[38;5;9m           There  is  an  additional  risk  when  performing  a remove physical element as it

       <b>--repopulateElements</b>

              Use this option to repopulate any physical storage elements that have been removed  from  use.   A
              full disk overwrite is necessary before the drive is usable.

       [49m[38;5;9m          There is an additional risk when performing a repopulate as it low-level formats

       <b>--setSectorSize</b> [new sector size]

              Changing  sector  sizes  is  intended  for  supported  Seagate products used in some hardware RAID
              configurations.  Please  consult  your  hardware  RAID   documentation   for   information   about
              compatibility   and  using  4K  native  sectors  before  using  this  option!   Software  RAID  or
              individual/JBOD drive solutions will see no benefit as modern file systems  and  modern  operating
              systems  are already 4K aware even on 512 emulation drives. Modern operating systems already align
              file systems to 4K boundaries required by these drives  for  optimal  performance.   Performing  a
              sector  size  change  is  data  destructive  and has a risk that the adapter, driver, or operating
              system may not know how to communicate with the device once this has completed.

       [49m[38;5;9m          There is an additional risk when performing a low-level format/fast format that may

              make the drive inoperable if it is reset at any time while it is formatting.

       [0m            For SATA Drives, the set sector configuration command must be supported.

              On SAS Drives, fast format must be supported to make these changes.

              Use the <b>--showSupportedFormats</b> option to see the sector sizes the  drive  reports  supporting.  If
              this option doesn't list anything, please consult your product manual.  This option should be used
              to  quickly change between 5xxe and 4xxx sector sizes. Using this option to change from 512 to 520
              or similar is not recommended at this time due to limited drive support

       [49m[38;5;11m         WARNING: Any interruption to the device while it is formatting may render the

              drive inoperable! Use this at your own risk!

       WARNING: Set sector size may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       WARNING (SATA): Do not interrupt this operation once it has started or
              it may cause the drive to become unusable.  Stop  all  possible  background  activity  that  would
              attempt to communicate with the device while this operation is in progress

       WARNING: It is not recommended to do this on USB as not
              all USB adapters can handle a 4k sector size.

       WARNING: Disable any out-of-band management systems/services/daemons
              before  using  this  option.  Interruptions can be caused by these and may prevent completion of a
              sector size change.

       WARNING: It is recommended that this operation is done from a bootable environment
              (Live USB) to reduce the risk of OS background activities running and triggering  a  device  reset
              while reformating the drive.

       <b>--formatMaxLBA</b> [ new max LBA ]

              Use this option to specify a new Max LBA for a drive during a  format  unit  operation.  This  may
              speed  up  a  format  unit  if  formatting to test something, or also desiring to reduce a drive's
              capacity while formatting.  NOTE: Not all devices support reducing capacity during a format.  Some
              may ignore this parameter and format the full medium anyways.  This is not guaranteed to stick  or
              reduce formatting time.

       <b>--protectionIntervalExponent</b> [ exponent value ]

              Use  this  option  to  specify  the  protection interval exponent for protection types 2 &amp; 3. This
              option is ignored for all other protection types.

       <b>--protectionType</b> [ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 ]

              Use this option to specify the protection type to format the medium with.  Note: Not  all  devices
              support protection types.

       <b>--fastFormat</b> [fast format mode] (SAS Only) (SBC4 required)

              Use  this  option  with  the  <b>--formatUnit</b>  option to run a fast format.  Changing sector sizes is
              intended for supported Seagate products used in some hardware RAID configurations. Please  consult
              your  hardware  RAID documentation for information about compatibility and using 4K native sectors
              before using this option!  Software RAID or individual/JBOD drive solutions will see no benefit as
              modern file systems and modern operating systems are  already  4K  aware  even  on  512  emulation
              drives.  Modern  operating  systems  already align file systems to 4K boundaries required by these
              drives for optimal performance.  Performing a sector size change is data  destructive  and  has  a
              risk that the adapter, driver, or operating system may not know how to communicate with the device
              once this has completed.

       [49m[38;5;9m          There is an additional risk when performing a low-level fast format that may

              make the drive inoperable if it is reset at any time while it is formatting.

   <b>[0m</b>            <b>Available</b> <b>fast</b> <b>format</b> <b>modes:</b>
       0 - This is a standard format unit command. All logical
              blocks will be overwritten. This command will take a very long time

       1 - This is a fast format unit command keeping existing
              data  in  physical  sector.  This option can be used to quickly change the the logical sector size
              between 5xxe and 4xxx. The media may be readable, but data may be unspecified or may return errors
              on read access according to it's error processing algorithms.

       2 - This is a fast format unit command that can change the
              logical sector size quickly. Media may or may not be  read  accessible  until  a  write  has  been
              performed to the media.

       [49m[38;5;11m         WARNING: Any interruption to the device while it is formatting may render the

              drive inoperable! Use this at your own risk!

       WARNING: Set sector size may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       WARNING: Disable any out-of-band management systems/services/daemons
              before  using  this  option.  Interruptions can be caused by these and may prevent completion of a
              sector size change.

       WARNING: It is recommended that this operation is done from a bootable environment
              (Live USB) to reduce the risk of OS background activities running and triggering  a  device  reset
              while reformating the drive.

       [0m    <b>--formatUnit</b> [current | new sector size]        (SAS Only)      (Clear)

              This  option  will  start a format unit operation on a SAS drive Use "current" to perform a format
              unit operation with the Sector size currently being used, otherwise enter a new sector size to use
              upon format completion. This command will erase all data on the drive. Combine  this  option  with
              <b>--poll</b>  to  poll for progress until the format is complete.  Changing sector sizes is intended for
              supported Seagate products used in some hardware RAID configurations. Please consult your hardware
              RAID documentation for information about compatibility and supported/required sector sizes!

       WARNING: Format Unit may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
              with multiple logical units or namespaces.

       WARNING: Customer unique firmware may have specific requirements that
              restrict sector sizes on some products. It may not be possible to format/ fast  format  to  common
              sizes like 4K or 512B due to these customer requirements.

       <b>--securityInitialize</b>

              Use this option to set the security initialize bit in the initialization pattern for a format unit
              command.  SBC recommends migrating to sanitize to overwrite previously reallocated sectors.  Note:
              Not all products support this option.

       <b>--stopOnListError</b>

              Use  this  option  to  set  the  stop format bit in a format unit.  If the device cannot locate or
              access an existing primary or grown defect list, the format will stop and return with an error.

              NVMe Only: ========= <b>--nvmFmtMetadataSet</b> [ xlba | separate ] (NVMe Only)

              Use this option to specify how metadata is transmitted to the host system.  Options:

              xlba - metadata is transferred  as  part  of  the  logical  block  data  separate  -  metadata  is
              transferred as a separate buffer

              Note:  Not  all  devices  support specifying this.  If this option is not provided, the NVM format
              will reuse the current setting.

       <b>--nvmFmtMS</b> [ # of bytes for metadata ]
              (NVMe Only)

              This option is used to specify the length of metadata with a requested  logical  block  size.  The
              device  must support the combination of logical block size and metadata size or the format will be
              rejected by the device.

       <b>--nvmFmtNSID</b> [all | current]
              (NVMe Only)

              This option changes the NSID used when issuing the NVM format command. This can be used to control
              formatting an entire device or a specific namespace if the  device  supports  specifying  specific
              namespaces  for  a  format  command.  Not all devices support this behavior. This has no effect on
              devices that do not support targeting a specific namespace and will format the  entire  device  If
              this option is not given, the format will be issued to all namespaces by default.

       <b>--nvmFmtPI</b> [ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 ]
              (NVMe Only)

              Use  this  option to specify the protection type to format the medium with.  Note: Not all devices
              support protection types.  If this option is not provided, the NVM format will reuse  the  current
              setting.

       <b>--nvmFmtPIL</b> [ beginning | end ] (NVMe Only)

              Use this option to specify the location protection information in an NVM device's metadata.  Note:
              Not  all  devices  support  specifying  this.  If this option is not provided, the NVM format will
              reuse the current setting.

       <b>--nvmFmtSecErase</b> [none | user | crypto] (NVMe Only)
              (None | Clear | Clear, Possible Purge)

              This option is used to specify the type of erase to perform during an NVM  format  operation.  All
              user  data  will  be inaccessible upon completion of an NVM format, no matter the erase requested.
              Options:

       none - no secure erase requested (previous data will not be accessible,
              however the media may not have been erased by the controller.)

              user - requests all user data is erased by the device. (Clear) crypto - requests  a  cryptographic
              erase of all user data. Note: this mode

              is not supported on all devices. (Clear, Possible Purge)

       <b>--nvmFormat</b> [current | format # | sector size]
              (NVMe Only)

              This option is used to start an NVM format operation.  Use "current" to perform a format operation
              with  the  Sector size currently being used.  If a value between 0 and 15 is given, then that will
              issue the NVM format with the specified sector size/metadata size for that supported format on the
              drive.  Values 512 and higher will be treated as a new sector  size  to  switch  to  and  will  be
              matched  to an appropriate lba format supported by the drive.  This command will erase all data on
              the drive.  Combine this option with--poll to poll for progress until the format is  complete.   A
              data  sanitization  compliant  with  IEEE  2883  Clear  requires the <b>--nvmFmtSecErase</b> option to be
              provided. Without this option the controller may not erase all user data and substitute  returning
              zeroes for performance instead.
