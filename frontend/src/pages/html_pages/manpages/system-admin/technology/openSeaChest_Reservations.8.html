              Only  use  this  option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products that do not otherwise work with
              the tool.  This option will enable a trial and error method  that  attempts  sending  various  ATA
              Identify  commands  through  vendor  specific  means.  Because  of this, certain products that may
              respond in unintended ways since they may interpret these commands  differently  than  the  bridge
              chip the command was designed for.

       <b>--forceATA</b>

              Using  this  option  will  force the current drive to be treated as a ATA drive. Only ATA commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>--forceATADMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the  protocol  set
              to DMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAPIO</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using  this  option  will  force  the tool to issue PIO commands to ATA device when possible. This
              option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAUDMA</b>

       Utility Arguments =================

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--device</b> [deviceHandle | all]

              Use  this option with most commands to specify the device handle on which to perform an operation.
              Example: /dev/sg&lt;#&gt; CSMI device handles can be specified as &lt;error&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&gt;  To  run  across  all
              devices  detected  in  the system, use the "all" argument instead of a device handle.  Example: <b>-d</b>
              all NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the

       specified options on each drive detected in the
              OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please use a script opening a separate instance for each
              device handle.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--scanFlags</b> [option list]

              Use this option to control the output from scan with the options listed  below.  Multiple  options
              can be combined.

       ata - show only ATA (SATA) devices
              usb  -  show  only  USB  devices scsi - show only SCSI (SAS) devices nvme - show only NVMe devices
              interfaceATA - show devices on an ATA interface interfaceUSB - show devices  on  a  USB  interface
              interfaceSCSI  -  show  devices on a SCSI or SAS interface interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe
              interface sd - show sd device handles sgtosd - show the sd and sg device handle mapping ignoreCSMI
              - do not scan for any CSMI devices allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD handles

              to show up multiple times in the list

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--deviceInfo</b>

              Show information and features for the storage device

       <b>--llInfo</b>

              Dump low-level information about the device to assist with debugging.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--scan</b>

              Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical  /dev/sg&lt;#&gt;  assignments.  Shows  model,
              serial  and  firmware numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately after booting,
              then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--Scan</b>

              This option is the same as <b>--scan</b> or <b>-s</b>, however it will also perform a low level rescan  to  pick
              up  other  devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may cause the
              OS to re-enumerate them.  Use this option when a device is plugged in  and  not  discovered  in  a
              normal  scan.   NOTE:  A  low-level  rescan may not be available on all interfaces or all OSs. The
              low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional devices in the system  when  the  device  is
              unable to come to a ready state.

       <b>--SATInfo</b>

              Displays  SATA  device  information  on any interface using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported
              data (translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log reported data.

       <b>--testUnitReady</b>

              Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the status. If the  drive  is  not  ready,  the
              sense key, asc, ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable translation from the SPC spec
              will be displayed if one is available.

       <b>--fastDiscovery</b>

       Use this option
              to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.

       <b>--prAllTargetPorts</b>
              (NVMe &amp; SAS only)

              Use  this option when registering a new key to specify that it applies to all target ports.  NOTE:
              Not all devices will support this option

       <b>--prClear</b>
              (NVMe &amp; SAS only)

              Use this option to clear all reservations using a key that is specified  by  the  <b>--prKey</b>  option.

       <b>--prKey</b> [key]
              (NVMe &amp; SAS Only)

              Use  this  option to specify the key to use for persistent reservation options. When registering a
              key, this provides the value expected for your use. It should continue  to  be  used  through  all
              persistent reseve operations until unregistered or cleared.

       <b>--prPersistThroughPowerLoss</b>
              (NVMe &amp; SAS only)

              Use  this option when registering a new key to activate the persist through power loss capability.

       <b>--prPreempt</b> [reservation key to preempt]
              (NVMe &amp; SAS only)

              Use this option to preempt another reservation using a registration key

              that is specified by the <b>--prKey</b> option.

              The specified key must already  be  registered  with  the  device.   This  is  used  to  remove  a
              reservation  from  another  initiator  and  start  a new one using the specified registration key.
              <b>--prType</b> must also be provided to specify the type of reservation that should be active  once  the
              preempt  has  completed.   Use  with the <b>--prPreemptAbort</b> option to cause the preempt to abort all
              outstanding commands to the previous reservation holder.
