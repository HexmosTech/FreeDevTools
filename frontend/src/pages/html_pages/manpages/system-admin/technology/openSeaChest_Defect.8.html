              Echo the command line entered into the utility on the screen.

       <b>--enableLegacyUSBPassthrough</b>

              Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products that do not  otherwise  work  with
              the  tool.   This  option  will  enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various ATA
              Identify commands through vendor specific means.  Because  of  this,  certain  products  that  may
              respond  in  unintended  ways  since they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
              chip the command was designed for.

       <b>--forceATA</b>

              Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as a ATA  drive.  Only  ATA  commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>--forceATADMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using  this  option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the protocol set
              to DMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAPIO</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to  ATA  device  when  possible.  This
              option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceATAUDMA</b>
              (SATA Only)

              Using  this  option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the protocol set
              to UDMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with <b>--forceATA</b>

       <b>--forceSCSI</b>

              Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as a SCSI drive. Only  SCSI  commands
              will be used to talk to the drive.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>

              Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now) Please report bugs/suggestions to

       Utility Arguments =================

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--device</b> [deviceHandle | all]

              Use this option with most commands to specify the device handle on which to perform an  operation.
              Example:  /dev/sg&lt;#&gt;  CSMI  device  handles can be specified as &lt;error&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&lt;#&gt;&gt; To run across all
              devices detected in the system, use the "all" argument instead of a device  handle.   Example:  <b>-d</b>
              all NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the

       specified options on each drive detected in the
              OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please use a script opening a separate instance for each
              device handle.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--scanFlags</b> [option list]

              Use  this  option  to control the output from scan with the options listed below. Multiple options
              can be combined.

       ata - show only ATA (SATA) devices
              usb - show only USB devices scsi - show only SCSI (SAS) devices nvme  -  show  only  NVMe  devices
              interfaceATA  -  show  devices  on an ATA interface interfaceUSB - show devices on a USB interface
              interfaceSCSI - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface interfaceNVME = show devices  on  an  NVMe
              interface sd - show sd device handles sgtosd - show the sd and sg device handle mapping ignoreCSMI
              - do not scan for any CSMI devices allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD handles

              to show up multiple times in the list

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--deviceInfo</b>

              Show information and features for the storage device

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--scan</b>

              Scan  the  system  and  list all storage devices with logical /dev/sg&lt;#&gt; assignments. Shows model,
              serial and firmware numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately  after  booting,
              then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--Scan</b>

              This  option  is the same as <b>--scan</b> or <b>-s</b>, however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick
              up other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may  cause  the
              OS  to  re-enumerate  them.   Use  this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a
              normal scan.  NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all  interfaces  or  all  OSs.  The
              low-level  rescan  is  not  guaranteed to find additional devices in the system when the device is
              unable to come to a ready state.

       <b>--SATInfo</b>

              Displays SATA device information on any interface using both SCSI Inquiry /  VPD  /  Log  reported
              data (translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log reported data.

       <b>--testUnitReady</b>

              Issues  a  SCSI  Test  Unit  Ready command and displays the status. If the drive is not ready, the
              sense key, asc, ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable translation from the SPC spec
              will be displayed if one is available.

       <b>--fastDiscovery</b>

       Use this option
              to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.

       <b>--errorLimit</b> [limit in number of LBAs]

              Use this option to specify a different error limit for a user generic or long generic read test or
              DST and Clean. This must be a number of

              logical LBAs to have errors. If a drive has multiple logical sectors  per  physical  sector,  this
              number will

              be adjusted for you to reflect the drive architecture.

       <b>--checkGrownListCount</b> [count to check]

              Use this option to check if the grown defect list count is greater than the provided value.

       <b>--checkPendingListCount</b> [count to check]

              Use  this  option  to  check  if the pending defect list count is greater than the provided value.
              NOTE: This only works on SAS products that support the Pending Defects log page from SBC4 or later

       <b>--showPendingList</b> (Seagate Only)

              Use this option to show the pending defect list as it  is  reported  by  the  drive.   NOTE:  SBC4
              pending log required for SAS support.

              SAS Only:

       <b>--defectFormat</b> [ # | shortBlock | longBlock | xbfi | xchs | bfi | chs ] (SAS Only)

              This  option  set  the  format  of  the defects to output.  Not all drives will support all defect
              modes!  SSDs will only support block modes!  Arguments: (name | #)

              shortBlock | 0 - show the defects in short block address mode (drives &lt; 32bit LBA) xbfi       |  1
              - show the defects in extended bytes from index mode xchs       | 2 - show the defects in extended
              physical  cylinder-head-sector  mode  longBlock  | 3 - show the defects in long block address mode
              (drives &gt; 32bit LBA) bfi        | 4 - show the defects in bytes from index mode chs        |  5  -
              show the defects in physical cylinder-head-sector mode

       <b>--showSCSIDefects</b> [ p | g | pg ]
              (SAS Only)

              This  option will display the SCSI defects on the screen.  The arguments to this will tell whether
              to get the grown, primary, or primary and grown defects from the drive.   Use  the  <b>--defectFormat</b>
              option  to  specify  the  mode  to  display  the  defects.   If  no  mode  is  specified, physical
              cylinder-head-sector mode is assumed Arguments:

              p - use this option to pull and display the primary (factory) defects g - use this option to  pull
              and display the grown (reallocated) defects

              The above options can be combined to pull and display both defect lists.

       Data Destructive Commands (Seagate only) ========================================

       <b>--bytesToCorrupt</b> [# of bytes]
              (Seagate Only)

              Use  this  option  to  specify  the number of data bytes to change when used with the <b>--corruptLBA</b>
              option.

       <b>--dstAndClean</b>

              Runs DST, then checks for an error and repairs the error if possible.  This  continues  until  all
              errors  reported  by  DST  are  fixed, or when the error limit is reached. The default limit is 50
              errors.

       <b>--corruptLBA</b> [lba]
              (Seagate Only)

              Use this option to corrupt the data bytes of an LBA. The <b>--bytesToCorrupt</b> option can  be  used  to
              specify  the  number of bytes to corrupt. If that option is not given, a default will be used that
              attempts to create a correctable  error  on  the  drive.   This  option  can  be  used  to  create
              uncorrectable  or correctable errors on a drive, depending on it's ECC algorithm and the number of
              corrupted data bytes.

       <b>--corruptRandomLBAs</b> [# of LBAs to corrupt]
              (Seagate Only)

              This option will corrupt the specified number of LBAs randomly on the device. The <b>--bytesToCorrupt</b>
              option can be used to specify the number of bytes to corrupt. If  that  option  is  not  given,  a
              default will be used that attempts to create a correctable error on the drive.  This option can be
              used to create uncorrectable or correctable errors on a drive, depending on it's ECC algorithm and
              the number of corrupted data bytes.

       <b>--corruptRange</b> [# of LBAs]
              (Seagate Only)

              This option is used with the <b>--corruptLBA</b> option to corrupt a range of LBAs on the drive.

       <b>--disableReadUncorrectables</b>

              Use this option to disable issuing read commands to the LBAs where errors are written. This option
              should  only be used for debugging. When this option is used, the uncorrectable errors may not end
              up being logged in the Pending Defect List on the drive.

       <b>--flaggedUncorrectable</b>
              (Seagate Only)

              Use this option to flag an uncorrectable error instead of creating a  pseudo  uncorrectable  error
              with the <b>--psuedoUncorrectable</b> or <b>--randomUncorrectables</b> options.  Error types:

       Pseudo - creates a pseudo uncorrectable error. The device
              will perform full error recovery and logging on failure.

       Flagged - flags an error. The device will not perform error
              recovery and will not log on failure.

       <b>--psuedoUncorrectable</b> [lba]
              (Seagate Only)

              Use  this option to create a uncorrectable error at the specified LBA. Use <b>--uncorrectableRange</b> to
              specify a range.  By default, pseudo uncorrectable errors will be created for the entire  physical
              sector.  Use  the  <b>--flaggedUncorrectable</b> option to flag errors instead. Flagged errors do not get
              logged or have any error processing when encountered.

       <b>--randomUncorrectables</b> [number of errors]
              (Seagate Only)

              Use this option to create a number of random uncorrectable LBAs on a drive.

       <b>--uncorrectableRange</b> [range]
              (Seagate Only)

              Use this option to specify a range of LBAs to create an uncorrectable error at. This  option  must
              be used with the <b>--psuedoUncorrectable</b> or <b>--flaggedUncorrectable</b> options so that a starting LBA is
              specified.
