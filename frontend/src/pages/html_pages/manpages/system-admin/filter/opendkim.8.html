</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>opendkim</b> - DKIM signing and verifying filter for MTAs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>opendkim</b>  [-A]  [-b  modes] [-c canon] [-d domain[,...]]  [-D] [-e name] [-f] [-F time] [-k keyfile] [-l]
       [-L min] [-n] [-o hdrlist] [-p socketspec]  [-P  pidfile]  [-Q]  [-r]  [-s  selector]  [-S  signalg]  [-t
       testfiles] [-T secs] [-u userid[:group]] [-v] [-V] [-W] [-x configfile] [-X]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>opendkim</b> implements the <b>DKIM</b> standard for signing and verifying e-mail messages on a per-domain basis.

       <b>opendkim</b>  uses  the  <u>milter</u>  interface, originally distributed as part of version 8.11 of <b><a href="../man8/sendmail.8.html">sendmail</a>(8),</b> to
       provide DKIM signing and/or verifying service for mail transiting a milter-aware MTA.

       Most, if not all, of the command line options listed below can also be set using  a  configuration  file.
       See the <u>-x</u> option for details.

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>SETS</b></h4><pre>
       Many  of  the  command  line and configuration file parameters will refer to a "dataset" as their values.
       This refers to a string that either contains the list of desirable values, or to  a  file  that  contains
       them, or (if enabled at compile time) a database containing the data.

       Some  data  sets  require  that the value contain more than one entry.  How this is done depends on which
       data set type is used.

       Which type is used depends on the format of the specification string.  Note that not  all  of  these  are
       necessarily  supported  for  all  installations;  most of them depend on the availability of a particular
       third-party library at compile time.

       In particular:

       <u>a)</u>     If the string begins with "file:", then the remainder of the string is presumed to refer to a flat
              file that contains elements of the data set,  one  per  line.   If  a  line  contains  whitespace-
              separated  values,  then  the line is presumed to define a key and its corresponding value.  Blank
              lines are ignored, and the hash ("#") character denotes the  start  of  a  comment.   If  a  value
              contains multiple entries, the entries should be separated by colons.

       <u>b)</u>     If  the  string  begins  with "refile:", then the remainder of the string is presumed to specify a
              file that contains a set of patterns, one per line, and their associated values.  The  pattern  is
              taken  as  the start of the line to the first whitespace, and the portion after that whitespace is
              taken as the value to be used  when  that  pattern  is  matched.   Patterns  are  simple  wildcard
              patterns, matching all text except that the asterisk ("*") character is considered a wildcard.  If
              a value contains multiple entries, the entries should be separated by colons.

       <u>c)</u>     If  the  string begins with "db:" and the program was compiled with Sleepycat DB support, then the
              remainder of the string  is  presumed  to  identify  a  Sleepycat  database  containing  keys  and
              corresponding  values.   These  may  be  used  only to test for membership in the data set, or for
              storing keys and corresponding values.  If a value contains multiple entries, the  entries  should
              be separated by colons.

       <u>d)</u>     If  the  string  begins with "dsn:" and the OpenDKIM library was compiled to support that database
              type, then the remainder of the string  is  a  Data  Store  Name  describing  the  type,  location
              parameters and access credentials for an ODBC or SQL database.  The DSN is of the form:

              backend://[user[:pwd]@][port+]host/dbase[/key=value[?...]]

              where  <u>backend</u>  is  the  name  of  a supported backend database mechanism (e.g. "mysql"), <u>user</u> and
              <u>password</u> are optional login credentials for the database, <u>port</u> and <u>host</u> describe  the  destination
              of a TCP connection to connect to that database, <u>dbase</u> is the name of the database to be accessed,
              and  the  <u>key=value</u>  pairs must specify at least "table", "keycol" and "datacol" values specifying
              the name of the table, the name of the column to consider as the  key,  and  the  name(s)  of  the
              column(s) to be considered as the values (separated by commas).  For example (all in one line):

              mysql:://dbuser:dbpass@3306+dbhost/odkim/table=macros
                       ?keycol=host?datacol=v1,v2

              defines a MySQL database listening at port 3306 on host "dbhost"; the userid "dbuser" and password
              "dbpass"  should be used to access the database; the database name is "odkim", and the data are in
              columns "host" (the keys) and "v1" and "v2" (the values)  inside  table  "macros".   This  example
              would thus return two values when a match is found.

              The  key  may  also include a "filter" value which will be included in all generated SQL as an AND
              clause after the WHERE clause that declares the search criteria.  For example, given the above DSN
              specification with an additional "filter" value of "ID &gt; 1000", the generated SQL for a query  for
              "foo" would look like so:

              SELECT v1,v2 FROM macros WHERE host = 'foo' AND ID &gt; 1000

              No value within the DSN may contain any of the six punctuation characters (":", "/", "@", "+", "?"
              and  "=")  used to delimit portions of the DSN.  To include such characters within a value, encode
              them in quoted-printable style (e.g., "=20" will be translated into  a  single  space  character).
              Encoding of spaces is also advised.

       <u>e)</u>     If  the  string  begins with "ldap:", "ldaps:" or "ldapi:", it is presumed to be a space-separated
              set of one or more LDAP URLs that identify a set of servers to be queried.  The first  one  should
              be  a full RFC4516 LDAP URL indicating a base DN template and optional scope, filter and attribute
              names to use in queries.  When constructing a DN template or filter, the special tokens  "$d"  and
              "$D"  are replaced with the key being queried and the key broken into components, separated at "."
              characters, each component preceded by "dc=" and followed by "," (so  "example.com"  would  become
              "dc=example,dc=com").   If  a  data  set  requires multiple values to be returned, the appropriate
              attribute names should be given in the correct order to satisfy such requests.

       <u>f)</u>     If the string begins with "lua:", it is presumed to refer to a file that contains a Lua script  to
              be  executed  whenever a query is performed.  The key for the query is placed in a global variable
              called "query", which the called script can then access.  The script  may  return  any  number  of
              values as required for the type of query being performed.

       <u>g)</u>     If the string begins with "memcache:", it is presumed to refer to a memory cache database provided
              by  <b>memcached.</b>   The  remainder  of  the  string is a comma-separated list of hosts to which query
              attempts should be made, each optionally followed by ":" and a port  number;  that  list  must  be
              followed  by  a slash ("/") character and a string that will be used to prefix queries send to the
              cache.  For example:

              memcache:localhost,otherhost/keyname

              This would use either "localhost" or "otherhost" to conduct queries, and all strings sent  to  the
              dataset will be prefixed with "keyname:".

       <u>h)</u>     If  the  string  contains  none  of  these  prefixes  but  ends with ".db", it is presumed to be a
              Sleepycat DB as described above (if support for same is compiled in).

       <u>i)</u>     If the string contains none of these prefixes but starts with  a  slash  ("/")  character,  it  is
              presumed to be a flat file as described above.

       <u>j)</u>     If  the string begins with "csl:", the string is treated as a comma-separated list as described in
              m) below.

       <u>k)</u>     If the string begins with "erlang:", it is presumed to refer to a function called to  be  made  to
              the specified distributed Erlang node(s). The specification is of the form

              erlang:node@host[,...]:cookie:module:function

              where  <u>node[,...]</u>   is  a list of comma-separated erlang nodes, <u>cookie</u> is the cookie for the known
              nodes of the distributed Erlang setup, <u>module</u> is the name of the Erlang module where the  function
              to  be called resides, <u>function</u> is the name of the Erlang function to be called. For example, (all
              in one line):

              erlang:mynode@myhost,myothernode@myotherhost:
                     chocolate:dkim:lookup

              will   join   the   distributed   Erlang   setup   connecting   to   either   "mynode@myhost"   or
              "myothernode@myotherhost"  (connections  to  nodes  are  tried  in order) using "chocolate" as the
              cookie, and use the function "dkim:lookup/1" for lookups.

       <u>l)</u>     If the string begins with "mdb:", it refers to a directory that contains  a  memory  database,  as
              provided by libmdb from OpenLDAP.

       <u>m)</u>     In  any other case, the string is presumed to be a comma-separated list.  Elements in the list are
              either simple data elements that are part of the set or, in the case  of  an  entry  of  the  form
              "x=y", are stored as key-value pairs as described above.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-A</u>     Automatically  re-start  on  failures.   Use  with caution; if the filter fails instantly after it
              starts, this can cause a tight <u><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a>(2)</u> loop.  This can be  mitigated  using  some  values  in  the
              configuration file to limit restarting.  See <u><a href="../man5/opendkim.conf.5.html">opendkim.conf</a>(5).</u>

       <u>-b</u> <u>modes</u>
              Selects  operating  modes.   <u>modes</u> is a concatenation of characters that indicate which mode(s) of
              operation are desired.  Valid modes are <u>s</u> (signer) and <u>v</u> (verifier).  The default is <u>sv</u> except  in
              test mode (see <u>-t</u> below) in which case the default is <u>v.</u>

       <u>-c</u> <u>canon</u>
              Selects  the  canonicalization  method(s)  to  be used when signing messages.  When verifying, the
              message's DKIM-Signature: header specifies the canonicalization method.  The recognized values are
              <u>relaxed</u> and <u>simple</u> as defined by the DKIM specification.  The default is <u>simple.</u>   The  value  may
              include  two  different  canonicalizations separated by a slash ("/") character, in which case the
              first will be applied to the headers and the second to the body.

       <u>-d</u> <u>dataset</u>
              A set of domains whose mail should be signed by this filter.  Mail  from  other  domains  will  be
              verified rather than being signed.

       <u>-D</u>     Sign subdomains of those listed by the <u>-d</u> option as well as the actual domains.

       <u>-e</u> <u>name</u>
              Extracts the value of <u>name</u> from the configuration file (if any).

       <u>-f</u>     Normally  <u>opendkim</u>  forks  and  exits  immediately, leaving the service running in the background.
              This flag suppresses that behaviour so that it runs in the foreground.

       <u>-F</u> <u>time</u>
              Specifies a fixed time to use when generating signatures.  Ignored unless also used in conjunction
              with <u>-t</u> (see below).  The time must be expressed in the usual UNIX <u>time_t</u>  (seconds  since  epoch)
              format.

       <u>-k</u> <u>keyfile</u>
              Gives the location of a PEM-formatted private key to be used for signing all messages.  Ignored if
              a configuration file is referenced that defines a KeyTable.

       <u>-l</u>     Log via calls to <u><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a>(3)</u> any interesting activity.

       <u>-L</u> <u>min[%+]</u>
              Instructs  the  verification  code  to  fail  messages for which a partial signature was received.
              There are three possible formats: <u>min</u> indicating at least <u>min</u> bytes of the message must be  signed
              (or  if  the  message  is  smaller than <u>min</u> then all of it must be signed); <u>min%</u> requiring that at
              least <u>min</u> percent of the received message must be signed; and <u>min+</u> meaning there may  be  no  more
              than <u>min</u> bytes of unsigned data appended to the message for it to be considered valid.

       <u>-n</u>     Parse  the  configuration  file  and  command line arguments, reporting any errors found, and then
              exit.  The exit value will be 0 if the filter  would  start  up  without  complaint,  or  non-zero
              otherwise.

       <u>-o</u> <u>dataset</u>
              Specifies a list of headers that should be omitted when generating signatures.  If an entry in the
              list names any header which is mandated by the DKIM specification, the entry is ignored.  A set of
              headers  is  listed in the DKIM specification as "SHOULD NOT" be signed; the default list for this
              parameter contains those headers (Return-Path, Received, Comments, Keywords, Bcc,  Resent-Bcc  and
              DKIM-Signature).   To omit no headers, simply use the string "-" (or any string that will match no
              headers).

       <u>-p</u> <u>socketspec</u>
              Specifies the socket that should  be  established  by  the  filter  to  receive  connections  from
              <u><a href="../man8/sendmail.8.html">sendmail</a>(8)</u>  in  order  to  provide  service.  <u>socketspec</u> is in one of two forms: <u>local:path</u> which
              creates a UNIX domain socket at the specified <u>path,</u> or <u>inet:port[@host]</u> or <u>inet6:port[@host]</u> which
              creates a TCP socket on the specified <u>port</u> using the requested protocol family.  If  the  <u>host</u>  is
              not  given  as either a hostname or an IP address, the socket will be listening on all interfaces.
              A literal IP address must be enclosed in square brackets.  If neither socket  type  is  specified,
              <u>local</u>  is  assumed,  meaning  the parameter is interpreted as a path at which the socket should be
              created.  This parameter is mandatory either here or in the configuration file.

       <u>-P</u> <u>pidfile</u>
              Specifies a file into which the filter should write its process ID at startup.

       <u>-Q</u>     Query test mode.  The filter will read two lines from standard input, one  containing  a  database
              description  to  be opened and one containing a string of the form "q/n" where "q" is the query to
              be performed and "n" is the number of fields to be retrieved.

       <u>-r</u>     Checks all messages for compliance with RFC5322 header count requirements.  Non-compliant messages
              are rejected.

       <u>-s</u> <u>selector</u>
              Defines the name of the selector to be used when signing messages.  See the <b>DKIM</b> specification for
              details.

       <u>-S</u> <u>signalg</u>
              Selects the signing algorithm to use when generating signatures.  Use 'opendkim  -V'  to  see  the
              list  of supported algorithms.  The default is <u>rsa-sha256</u> if it is available, otherwise it will be
              <u>rsa-sha1.</u>

       <u>-t</u> <u>testfiles</u>
              Evaluates (verifies) one or more RFC5322-formatted message found  in  <u>testfiles</u>  and  exits.   The
              value  of <u>testfiles</u> should be a comma-separated list of one or more filenames, one of which may be
              "-" if the message should be read from standard input.

       <u>-T</u> <u>secs</u>
              Sets the DNS timeout in seconds.  A value of 0  causes  an  infinite  wait.   The  default  is  5.
              Ignored if not using an asynchronous resolver package.  See also the NOTES section below.

       <u>-u</u> <u>userid[:group]</u>
              Attempts to be come the specified <u>userid</u> before starting operations.  The process will be assigned
              all of the groups and primary group ID of the named <u>userid</u> unless an alternate <u>group</u> is specified.
              See the FILE PERMISSIONS section for more information.

       <u>-v</u>     Increase  verbose  output  during  test  mode  (see <u>-t</u> above).  May be specified more than once to
              request increasing amounts of output.

       <u>-V</u>     Print the version number and supported canonicalization and signature algorithms,  and  then  exit
              without doing anything else.

       <u>-W</u>     If  logging  is  enabled  (see  <u>-l</u> above), issues very detailed logging about the logic behind the
              filter's decision to either sign a message or verify it.  The "W" stands for  "Why?!"   since  the
              logic  behind the decision is non-trivial and can be confusing to administrators not familiar with
              its operation.  A description of how the decision is made can be found in the OPERATION section of
              this document.  This causes a large increase in the amount of log data generated for each message,
              so it should be limited to debugging use and not enabled for general operation.

       <u>-x</u> <u>configfile</u>
              Read the named configuration file.  See the <u><a href="../man5/opendkim.conf.5.html">opendkim.conf</a>(5)</u> man page for details.  Values in  the
              configuration  file are overridden when their equivalents are provided on the command line until a
              configuration reload occurs.  The OPERATION section describes  how  reloads  are  triggered.   The
              default  is  to  read  a configuration file from <u>/etc/opendkim.conf</u> if one exists, or otherwise to
              apply defaults to all values.

       <u>-X</u>     Tolerates configuration file items that have been internally  marked  as  "deprecated".   Normally
              when a configuration file item is removed from the package, it is flagged in this way for at least
              one full release cycle.  The presence of a deprecated configuration file item typically causes the
              filter  to  return an error and refuse to start.  Setting this flag will allow the filter to start
              and a warning is logged.  In some future release when the item is removed completely, a  different
              error  results,  and  it  will  not  be  possible  to  start  the filter.  Use of this flag is NOT
              RECOMMENDED; it could  effectively  hide  a  major  configuration  change  with  serious  security
              implications.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       A  message  will be verified unless it conforms to the signing criteria, which are: (1) the domain on the
       From: address (if present) must be listed by the <u>-d</u> command line switch or the <u>Domain</u> configuration  file
       setting,  and  (2)  (a)  the  client  connecting  to  the  MTA must have authenticated, or (b) the client
       connecting to the MTA must be listed in the file  referenced  by  the  <u>InternalHosts</u>  configuration  file
       setting (or be in the default list for that option), or (c) the client must be connected to a daemon port
       named  by  the  <u>MTAs</u> configuration file setting, or (d) the MTA must have set one or more macros matching
       the criteria set by the <u>MacroList</u> configuration file setting.

       For (a) above, the test is whether or not the MTA macro "{auth_type}" is set and contains  any  non-empty
       value.   This  means the MTA must pass the value of that macro to the filter before or during the end-of-
       header (EOH) phase in order for its value to be tested.  Check your MTA's configuration documentation for
       details.

       For (1) above, other header fields may be selected using the SenderHeaders  configuration  file  setting.
       See <u><a href="../man5/opendkim.conf.5.html">opendkim.conf</a>(5)</u> for more information.

       When  signing  a  message,  a  <u>DKIM-Signature:</u> header will be prepended to the message.  The signature is
       computed using the private key provided.  You must be running a version of <u><a href="../man8/sendmail.8.html">sendmail</a>(8)</u> recent  enough  to
       be able to do header prepend operations (8.13.0 or later).

       When verifying a message, an <u>Authentication-Results:</u> header will be prepended to indicate the presence of
       a signature and whether or not it could be validated against the body of the message using the public key
       advertised  by the sender's nameserver.  The value of this header can be used by mail user agents to sort
       or discard messages that were not signed or could not be verified.

       Upon receiving SIGUSR1, if the filter was started with a configuration file, it will be re-read  and  the
       new values used.  Note that any command line overrides provided at startup time will be lost when this is
       done.  Also, the following configuration file values (and their corresponding command line items, if any)
       are  not  reloaded through this process: AutoRestart (-A), AutoRestartCount, AutoRestartRate, Background,
       MilterDebug,  PidFile  (-P),  POPDBFile,  Quarantine  (-q),  QueryCache,  Socket  (-p),   StrictTestMode,
       TestPublicKeys,  UMask,  UserID (-u).  The filter does not automatically check the configuration file for
       changes and reload.

</pre><h4><b>MTA</b> <b>MACROS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>opendkim</b> makes use of three MTA-provided macros, plus any demanded by  configuration.   The  basic  three
       are:  "i"  (the  envelope  ID,  also  known  as  the  job ID or the queue ID), which is used for logging;
       "daemon_name" (the symbolic name given to the MTA instance that accepted the connection), which  is  used
       when  performing  tests  against  any  "MTAs"  setting  used; and "auth_type", which is used to determine
       whether or not the SMTP client authenticated to the MTA.  If the MTA does not provide  them  to  <b>opendkim</b>
       then  it  is  not  able  to  apply  their  corresponding  tests  or  do useful logging.  Consult your MTA
       documentation to determine how to adjust your  its  configuration  if  some  or  all  of  these  are  not
       available.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>PERMISSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       When  the filter is started as the superuser and the UserID (-u) setting is used, the filter gives up its
       root privileges by changing to  the  specified  user  after  the  following  steps  are  taken:  (1)  the
       configuration  file  (if any) is loaded; (2) if the KeyFile (-k) setting is used, that key is loaded into
       memory; (3) all data sets in the configuration file are opened, and those that are based  on  flat  files
       are  also  read  into  memory; and (4) if ChangeRootDirectory is set, the process root is changed to that
       directory.  This means on configuration reload, the filter will not  be  accessing  these  files  or  the
       configuration file as the superuser (and possibly from a different root), and any key files referenced by
       the KeyTable will also be accessed by the new user.

       Thus, keys referenced by the KeyTable must always be accessible for read by the unprivileged user.  Also,
       run-time  reloads  are  not  possible  if any of the other files will not be readable by the unprivileged
       user.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variable(s) can be used to adjust the behaviour of this filter:

       <u>DKIM_TMPDIR</u>
              The directory to use when creating temporary files.  The default is <u>/tmp.</u>

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       When using DNS timeouts (see the <u>-T</u> option above), be sure not to use a timeout that is larger  than  the
       timeout  being  used  for  interaction between <u>sendmail</u> and the filter.  Otherwise, the MTA could abort a
       message while waiting for a reply from the filter, which in turn is still waiting for a DNS reply.

       The POP authentication database is expected to be a Sleepycat DB file (formerly known as a  Berkeley  DB)
       in  hash  format with keys containing the IP address in text form without a terminating NULL.  The values
       of these records are not checked; only the existence of such records is of  interest.   The  filter  will
       attempt to establish a shared lock on the database before reading from it, so any programs which write to
       the  database  should  keep  their  lock  use  to a minimum or else this filter will appear to hang while
       waiting for the lock operation to complete.

       Features that involve specification of IPv4 addresses or CIDR blocks will use the  <u><a href="../man3/inet_addr.3.html">inet_addr</a>(3)</u>  function
       to  parse  that information.  Users should be familiar with the way that function handles the non-trivial
       cases (for example, "192.0.2/24" and "192.0.2.0/24" are not the same thing).

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       Filter exit status codes are selected according to <u><a href="../man3/sysexits.3.html">sysexits</a>(3).</u>

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       DKIM is an amalgam of Yahoo!'s <b>DomainKeys</b> proposal, and Cisco's <b>Internet</b> <b>Identified</b> <b>Mail</b> (IIM) proposal.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This man page covers version 2.11.0 of <u>opendkim.</u>
