</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       filter-a - filter A in DNS responses when AAAA is present

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>plugin</b> <b>query</b> "filter-a.so" [{ parameters }];

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>filter-a.so</b>  is  a  query  plugin  module  for  <u>named</u>,  enabling  <u>named</u>  to omit some IPv4 addresses when
       responding to clients.

       For example:

          plugin query "filter-a.so" {
                  filter-a-on-v6 yes;
                  filter-a-on-v4 yes;
                  filter-a { 192.0.2.1; 2001:db8:2::1; };
          };

       This module is intended to aid transition from IPv4 to  IPv6  by  withholding  IPv4  addresses  from  DNS
       clients  which  are not connected to the IPv4 Internet, when the name being looked up has an IPv6 address
       available. Use of this module is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.

       Note: This mechanism can erroneously cause other servers not to give A records to  their  clients.  If  a
       recursing  server  with both IPv6 and IPv4 network connections queries an authoritative server using this
       mechanism via IPv6, it is denied A records even if its client is using IPv4.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>filter-a</b>
              This option specifies a list of client addresses for which A  filtering  is  to  be  applied.  The
              default is <b>any</b>.

       <b>filter-a-on-v6</b>
              If  set  to  <b>yes</b>, this option indicates that the DNS client is at an IPv6 address, in <b>filter-a</b>. If
              the response does not include DNSSEC signatures, then all A records are deleted from the response.
              This filtering applies to all responses, not only authoritative ones.

              If set to <b>break-dnssec</b>, then A records are deleted even when DNSSEC is enabled.  As  suggested  by
              the  name,  this causes the response to fail to verify, because the DNSSEC protocol is designed to
              detect deletions.

              This mechanism can erroneously cause other servers not to give A records to their  clients.  If  a
              recursing server with both IPv6 and IPv4 network connections queries an authoritative server using
              this mechanism via IPv6, it is denied A records even if its client is using IPv4.

       <b>filter-a-on-v4</b>
              This  option  is  identical  to <b>filter-a-on-v6</b>, except that it filters A responses to queries from
              IPv4 clients instead of IPv6 clients. To filter all responses, set both options to <b>yes</b>.
