</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       filter-aaaa - filter AAAA in DNS responses when A is present

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>plugin</b> <b>query</b> "filter-aaaa.so" [{ parameters }];

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>filter-aaaa.so</b>  is  a  query  plugin  module  for  <u>named</u>, enabling <u>named</u> to omit some IPv6 addresses when
       responding to clients.

       Until BIND 9.12, this feature was implemented natively in <u>named</u> and enabled with the <b>filter-aaaa</b> ACL  and
       the  <b>filter-aaaa-on-v4</b> and <b>filter-aaaa-on-v6</b> options. These options are no longer available in <u>named.conf</u>
       but can be passed as parameters to the <b>filter-aaaa.so</b> plugin, for example:

          plugin query "filter-aaaa.so" {
                  filter-aaaa-on-v4 yes;
                  filter-aaaa-on-v6 yes;
                  filter-aaaa { 192.0.2.1; 2001:db8:2::1; };
          };

       This module is intended to aid transition from IPv4 to  IPv6  by  withholding  IPv6  addresses  from  DNS
       clients  which  are not connected to the IPv6 Internet, when the name being looked up has an IPv4 address
       available. Use of this module is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.

       Note: This mechanism can erroneously cause other servers not to give AAAA records to their clients. If  a
       recursing  server  with both IPv6 and IPv4 network connections queries an authoritative server using this
       mechanism via IPv4, it is denied AAAA records even if its client is using IPv6.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>filter-aaaa</b>
              This option specifies a list of client addresses for which AAAA filtering is to  be  applied.  The
              default is <b>any</b>.

       <b>filter-aaaa-on-v4</b>
              If set to <b>yes</b>, this option indicates that the DNS client is at an IPv4 address, in <b>filter-aaaa</b>. If
              the  response  does  not  include  DNSSEC  signatures,  then all AAAA records are deleted from the
              response. This filtering applies to all responses, not only authoritative ones.

              If set to <b>break-dnssec</b>, then AAAA records are deleted even when DNSSEC is enabled. As suggested by
              the name, this causes the response to fail to verify, because the DNSSEC protocol is  designed  to
              detect deletions.

              This mechanism can erroneously cause other servers not to give AAAA records to their clients. If a
              recursing server with both IPv6 and IPv4 network connections queries an authoritative server using
              this mechanism via IPv4, it is denied AAAA records even if its client is using IPv6.

       <b>filter-aaaa-on-v6</b>
              This  option  is  identical to <b>filter-aaaa-on-v4</b>, except that it filters AAAA responses to queries
              from IPv6 clients instead of IPv4 clients. To filter all responses, set both options to <b>yes</b>.
