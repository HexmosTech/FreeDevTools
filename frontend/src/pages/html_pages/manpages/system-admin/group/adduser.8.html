</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>adduser</b>  and  <b>addgroup</b>  add  users  and  groups  to  the  system  according  to  command line options and
       configuration information in <u><a href="file:/etc/adduser.conf">/etc/adduser.conf</a></u>.  They are more Debian specific front ends to the <b>useradd</b>,
       <b>groupadd</b> and <b>usermod</b> programs, which are more distribution agnostic.  <b>adduser</b>  and  <b>addgroup</b>  by  default
       choose  Debian policy conformant UID and GID values, create a home directory with skeletal configuration,
       run a custom script, and have other features.

       <b>adduser</b> and <b>addgroup</b> are intended as a policy layer, making it easier for package maintainers  and  local
       administrators  to  create local system accounts in the way Debian expects them to be created, taking the
       burden to adapt to the probably changing specifications of Debian policy.  <b>adduser</b> <b>--system</b> takes special
       attention on just needing a single call  in  the  package  maintainer  scripts  without  any  conditional
       wrappers, error suppression or other scaffolding.

       <b>adduser</b>  honors  the  distinction  between  <u>dynamically</u> <u>allocated</u> <u>system</u> <u>users</u> <u>and</u> <u>groups</u> and <u>dynamically</u>
       <u>allocated</u> <u>user</u> <u>accounts</u> that is documented in Debian Policy, Chapter 9.2.2.

       For a full list and explanations of all options, see the OPTIONS section.

       <b>adduser</b> and <b>addgroup</b> can be run in one of five modes:

   <b>Add</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>(non-system)</b> <b>user</b>
       If called with one non-option argument and without the <b>--system</b> or <b>--group</b> options, <b>adduser</b>  will  add  a
       regular  user,  that  means  a <u>dynamically</u> <u>allocated</u> <u>user</u> <u>account</u> in the sense of Debian Policy.  This is
       commonly referred to in <b>adduser</b> as a <u>non-system</u> <u>user.</u>

       <b>adduser</b> will choose the first available UID from the range specified by <b>FIRST_UID</b>  and  <b>LAST_UID</b>  in  the
       configuration file.  The range may be overridden with the <b>--firstuid</b> and <b>--lastuid</b> options.  Finally, the
       UID can be set fully manually with the <b>--uid</b> option.

       By  default,  each  user  is  given  a  corresponding  group with the same name.  This is commonly called
       <u>Usergroups</u> and allows group writable directories to be easily maintained by placing the appropriate users
       in the new group, setting the set-group-ID bit in the directory, and ensuring that all users use a  umask
       of 002.

       For  a  usergroup,  <b>adduser</b> will choose the first available GID from the range specified by <b>FIRST_GID</b> and
       <b>LAST_GID</b> in the configuration file.  The range may  be  overridden  with  the  <b>--firstgid</b>  and  <b>--lastgid</b>
       options.  Finally, the GID can be set fully manually with the <b>--gid</b> option.

       The interaction between <b>USERS_GID</b>, <b>USERS_GROUP</b>, and <b>USERGROUPS</b> is explained in detail in <b><a href="../man5/adduser.conf.5.html">adduser.conf</a></b>(5).

       The  new  user's  primary  group can also be overridden from the command line with the <b>--gid</b> or <b>--ingroup</b>
       options to set the group by id or  name,  respectively.   Also,  users  can  be  added  to  one  or  more
       supplemental  groups defined as <b>EXTRA_GROUPS</b> either by setting <b>ADD_EXTRA_GROUPS</b> to 1 in the configuration
       file, or by passing <b>--add-extra-groups</b> on the command line.

       <b>adduser</b> will copy files from <u><a href="file:/etc/skel">/etc/skel</a></u> into the home directory and prompt for the  comment  field  and  a
       password if those functions have not been turned off / overridden from the command line.

       UID,  comment,  home  directory  and shell might be pre-determined with the <b>UID_POOL</b> and <b>GID_POOL</b> option,
       documented in <b><a href="../man5/adduser.conf.5.html">adduser.conf</a></b>(5).

       To set up an encrypted home directory for  the  new  user,  add  the  <b>--encrypt-home</b>  option.   For  more
       information, refer to the -b option of <b><a href="../man1/ecryptfs-setup-private.1.html">ecryptfs-setup-private</a>(1).</b>

   <b>Add</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>user</b>
       If  called with one non-option argument and the <b>--system</b> option, <b>adduser</b> will add a <u>dynamically</u> <u>allocated</u>
       <u>system</u> <u>user,</u> often abbreviated as <u>system</u> <u>user</u> in the context of the <b>adduser</b> package.

       <b>adduser</b>  will  choose  the  first  available  UID  from  the  range  specified  by  <b>FIRST_SYSTEM_UID</b>  and
       <b>LAST_SYSTEM_UID</b> in the configuration file.  This can be overridden with the <b>--uid</b> option.

       By  default,  system users are assigned <b>nogroup</b> as primary group.  To assign an already existing group as
       primary group, use the <b>--gid</b> or <b>--ingroup</b> options.  If the <b>--group</b> option is given  and  the  identically
       named group does not already exist, it is created with the same ID.

       If  no  home  directory  is  specified, the default home directory for a new system user is <u>/nonexistent</u>.
       This directory should never exist on any Debian system, and <b>adduser</b> will never create it automatically.

       If a home directory is specified with the <b>--home</b> option,  and  the  directory  does  already  exist  (for
       example,  if  the package ships with files in that directory), <b>adduser</b> silently does not set the owner of
       the directory to the newly created user.  Setting the owner might override a decision of the local admin,
       and reporting the fact would break <b>adduser</b>'s silence during package installation.   If  you  use  <b>adduser</b>
       <b>--home</b>  in your package's maintainer scripts, you might want to issue an explicit recursive <b>chown</b> for the
       home directory after the call to <b>adduser</b>.

       Unless a shell is explicitly set with the <b>--shell</b> option, the new system user will have the shell set  to
       <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?nologin">/usr/sbin/nologin</a></u>.  <b>adduser</b> <b>--system</b> does not set a password for the new account.  Skeletal configuration
       files are not copied.

       Other  options  will  behave as for the creation of a regular user.  The files referenced by <b>UID_POOL</b> and
       <b>GID_POOL</b> are also honored.

   <b>Add</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b>
       If <b>adduser</b> is called with the <b>--group</b> option and without the  <b>--system</b>  option,  or  <b>addgroup</b>  is  called
       respectively, a user group will be added.

       A  <u>dynamically</u>  <u>allocated</u>  <u>system</u>  <u>group,</u> often abbreviated as <u>system</u> <u>group</u> in the context of the <b>adduser</b>
       package, will be created if <b>adduser</b> <b>--group</b> or <b>addgroup</b> are called with the <b>--system</b> option.

       A GID will be chosen from the respective range specified for GIDs in the configuration  file  (<b>FIRST_GID</b>,
       <b>LAST_GID</b>, <b>FIRST_SYSTEM_GID</b>, <b>LAST_SYSTEM_GID</b>).  To override that mechanism, you can give the GID using the
       <b>--gid</b> option.

       For  non-system  groups,  the  range  specified  in  the  configuration  file  may be overridden with the
       <b>--firstgid</b> and <b>--lastgid</b> options.

       The group is created with no members.

   <b>Add</b> <b>an</b> <b>existing</b> <b>user</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>existing</b> <b>group</b>
       If called with two non-option arguments, <b>adduser</b> will add an existing user to an existing group.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Different modes of <b>adduser</b> allow different options.  If no valid modes are listed for  a  option,  it  is
       accepted in all modes.

       Short  versions  for certain options may exist for historical reasons.  They are going to stay supported,
       but are removed from the documentation.  Users are advised to migrate to the long version of options.

       <b>--add-extra-groups</b>
              Add new user to extra groups defined in the configuration files' <b>EXTRA_GROUPS</b>  setting.   The  old
              spelling  <b>--add_extra_groups</b>  is  deprecated and will be supported in Debian bookworm only.  Valid
              modes: <b>adduser</b>, <b>adduser</b> <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--allow-all-names</b>
              Allow any user- and groupname which is supported by the underlying <b><a href="../man8/useradd.8.html">useradd</a></b>(8).   See  VALID  NAMES
              below.  Valid modes: <b>adduser</b>, <b>adduser</b> <b>--system</b>, <b>addgroup</b>, <b>addgroup</b> <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--allow-bad-names</b>
              Disable  <b>NAME_REGEX</b>  and  <b>SYS_NAME_REGEX</b>  check of names.  Only a weaker check for validity of the
              name is applied.  See VALID NAMES  below.   Valid  modes:  <b>adduser</b>,  <b>adduser</b>  <b>--system</b>,  <b>addgroup</b>,
              <b>addgroup</b> <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--comment</b> <u>comment</u>
              Set  the  comment  field for the new entry generated.  <b>adduser</b> will not ask for the information if
              this option is given.  This  field  is  also  known  under  the  name  GECOS  field  and  contains
              information  that  is used by the <b><a href="../man1/finger.1.html">finger</a></b>(1) command.  This used to be the <b>--gecos</b> option, which is
              deprecated and will be removed after Debian bookworm.  Valid modes: <b>adduser</b>, <b>adduser</b> <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--conf</b> <u>file</u>
              Use <u>file</u> instead of <u><a href="file:/etc/adduser.conf">/etc/adduser.conf</a></u>.  Multiple <b>--conf</b> options can be given.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Synonymous to <b>--stdoutmsglevel=debug.</b>  Deprecated.

       <b>--disabled-login</b>
       <b>--disabled-password</b>
              Do not run <b><a href="../man1/passwd.1.html">passwd</a></b>(1) to set a password.  In most situations, logins are still possible though (for
              example  using  SSH  keys  or  through  PAM)  for  reasons  that  are  beyond   <b>adduser</b>'s   scope.
              <b>--disabled-login</b> will additionally set the shell to <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?nologin">/usr/sbin/nologin</a></u>.  Valid mode: <b>adduser</b>.

       <b>--firstuid</b> <u>ID</u>
       <b>--lastuid</b> <u>ID</u>
       <b>--firstgid</b> <u>ID</u>
       <b>--lastgid</b> <u>ID</u>
              Override  the first UID / last UID / first GID / last GID in the range that the uid is chosen from
              (<b>FIRST_UID</b>, <b>LAST_UID</b>, <b>FIRST_GID</b> and <b>LAST_GID</b>, <b>FIRST_SYSTEM_UID</b>, <b>LAST_SYSTEM_UID</b>,  <b>FIRST_SYSTEM_GID</b>
              and  <b>LAST_SYSTEM_GID</b> in the configuration file).  If a group is created as a usergroup, <b>--firstgid</b>
              and <b>--lastgid</b> are ignored.  The group gets the same ID as the user.  Valid modes: <b>adduser</b>, <b>adduser</b>
              <b>--system</b>, for <b>--firstgid</b> and <b>--lastgid</b> also <b>addgroup</b>.

       <b>--force-badname</b>
       <b>--allow-badname</b>
              These are the deprecated forms of <b>--allow-bad-names</b>.  They will  be  removed  during  the  release
              cycle of Debian 13.

       <b>--extrausers</b>
              Uses extra users as the database.

       <b>--gid</b> <u>GID</u>
              When  creating  a  group,  this  option  sets  the  group ID number of the new group to <u>GID</u>.  When
              creating a user, this option sets the primary group ID number of  the  new  user  to  <u>GID</u>.   Valid
              modes: <b>adduser</b>, <b>adduser</b> <b>--system</b>, <b>addgroup</b>, <b>addgroup</b> <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--group</b>
              Using  this option in <b>adduser</b> <b>--system</b> indicates that the new user should get an identically named
              group as its primary group.  If that identically  named  group  is  not  already  present,  it  is
              created.   If  not  combined with <b>--system</b>, a group with the given name is created.  The latter is
              the default action if the  program  is  invoked  as  <b>addgroup</b>.   Valid  modes:  <b>adduser</b>  <b>--system</b>,
              <b>addgroup</b>, <b>addgroup</b> <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--help</b> Display brief instructions.

       <b>--home</b> <u>dir</u>
              Use  <u>dir</u> as the user's home directory, rather than the default specified by the configuration file
              (or <u>/nonexistent</u> if <b>adduser</b> <b>--system</b> is used).  If the directory does not exist,  it  is  created.
              Valid modes: <b>adduser</b>, <b>adduser</b> <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--ingroup</b> <u>GROUP</u>
              When  creating  a user, this option sets the primary group ID number of the new user to the GID of
              the named group.  Unlike with the <b>--gid</b> option, the group is specified here by name rather than by
              numeric ID number.  The group must already exist.  Valid modes: <b>adduser</b>, <b>adduser</b> <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--lastuid</b> <u>ID</u>
       <b>--lastgid</b> <u>ID</u>
              Override the last UID / last GID.  See <b>--firstuid</b>.

       <b>--no-create-home</b>
              Do not create a home directory for the new user.  Note that the pathname for the new  user's  home
              directory will still be entered in the appropriate field in the <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u> file.  The use of this
              option  does not imply that this field should be empty.  Rather, it indicates to <b>adduser</b> that some
              other mechanism will be responsible for initializing the new user's home directory.  Valid  modes:
              <b>adduser</b>, <b>adduser</b> <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--quiet</b>
              Synonymous to <b>--stdoutmsglevel=warn.</b>  Deprecated.

       <b>--shell</b> <u>shell</u>
              Use  <u>shell</u>  as the user's login shell, rather than the default specified by the configuration file
              (or <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?nologin">/usr/sbin/nologin</a></u> if <b>adduser</b> <b>--system</b> is used).  Valid modes: <b>adduser</b>, <b>adduser</b> <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--system</b>
              Normally, <b>adduser</b> creates <u>dynamically</u> <u>allocated</u> <u>user</u> <u>accounts</u> <u>and</u>  <u>groups</u>  as  defined  in  Debian
              Policy,  Chapter 9.2.2.  With this option, <b>adduser</b> creates a <u>dynamically</u> <u>allocated</u> <u>system</u> <u>user</u> <u>and</u>
              <u>group</u> and changes its mode respectively.  Valid modes: <b>adduser</b>, <b>addgroup</b>.

       <b>--uid</b> <u>ID</u>
              Force the new userid to be the given number.  <b>adduser</b> will fail if the userid  is  already  taken.
              Valid modes: <b>adduser</b>, <b>adduser</b> <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Synonymous to <b>--stdoutmsglevel=info.</b>  Deprecated.

       <b>--stdoutmsglevel</b> <u>prio</u>
       <b>--stderrmsglevel</b> <u>prio</u>
       <b>--logmsglevel</b> <u>prio</u>
              Minimum  priority for messages logged to syslog/journal and the console, respectively.  Values are
              <u>trace</u>, <u>debug</u>, <u>info</u>, <u>warn</u>, <u>err</u>, and <u>fatal</u>.  Messages with the  priority  set  here  or  higher  get
              printed  to  the  respective medium.  Messages printed to stderr are not repeated on stdout.  That
              allows  the  local  admin  to  control  <b>adduser</b>'s  chattiness  on  the  console  and  in  the  log
              independently,  keeping  probably  confusing  information  to  itself  while still leaving helpful
              information in the log.  stdoutmsglevel, stderrmsglevel, and logmsglevel default  to  warn,  warn,
              info, respectively.

       <b>-v</b> , <b>--version</b>
              Display version and copyright information.

</pre><h4><b>VALID</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       Historically,  <b><a href="../man8/adduser.8.html">adduser</a></b>(8)  and <b><a href="../man8/addgroup.8.html">addgroup</a></b>(8) enforced conformity to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, which allows only
       the following characters to appear in group- and usernames: letters,  digits,  underscores,  periods,  at
       signs  (@)  and  dashes.  The name may not start with a dash or @.  The "$" sign is allowed at the end of
       usernames to allow typical Samba machine accounts.

       The default settings for <b>NAME_REGEX</b> and <b>SYS_NAME_REGEX</b> allow usernames to  contain  letters  and  digits,
       plus dash (-) and underscore (_); the name must begin with a letter (or an underscore for system users).

       The  least  restrictive  policy,  available  by using the <b>--allow-all-names</b> option, simply makes the same
       checks as <b><a href="../man8/useradd.8.html">useradd</a></b>(8).  Please note that useradd's checks have become quite  a  bit  more  restrictive  in
       Debian 13.

       Changing the default behavior can be used to create confusing or misleading names; use with caution.

</pre><h4><b>LOGGING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Adduser</b>  uses  extensive  and  configurable  logging  to  tailor its verbosity to the needs of the system
       administrator.

       Every message that <b>adduser</b> prints has a priority value assigned by the authors.  This priority can not be
       changed at run time.  Available priority values are <b>crit</b>, <b>error</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>, and <b>trace</b>.

       If you find that a message has the wrong priority, please file a bug.

       Every time a message is generated, the code decides whether to print  the  message  to  standard  output,
       standard  error,  or  syslog.   This is mainly and independently controlled by the configuration settings
       <b>STDOUTMSGLEVEL</b>, <b>STDERRMSGLEVEL</b>, and <b>LOGMSGLEVEL</b>.  For testing purposes, these settings can be  overridden
       on the command line.

       Only  messages  with  a  priority  higher  or  equal  to  the  respective message level are logged to the
       respective output medium.  A message that was written to standard error is not written a second  time  to

       <b>0</b>      Success:  The  user  or  group exists as specified.  This can have 2 causes: The user or group was
              created by this call to <b>adduser</b> or the user  or  group  was  already  present  on  the  system  as
              specified  before <b>adduser</b> was invoked.  If <b>adduser</b> <b>--system</b> is invoked for a user already existing
              with the requested or compatible attributes, it will also return 0.

       <b>11</b>     The object that <b>adduser</b> was asked to create does already exist.

       <b>12</b>     The object that <b>adduser</b> or <b>deluser</b> was asked to operate on does not exist.

       <b>13</b>     The object that <b>adduser</b> or <b>deluser</b> was asked to operate on does not have the properties  that  are
              required  to complete the operation: A user (a group) that was requested to be created as a system
              user (group) does already exist and is not a system user (group),  or  a  user  (group)  that  was
              requested to be created with a certain UID (GID) does already exist and has a different UID (GID),
              or  a  system  user  (group) that was requested to be deleted does exist, but is not a system user
              (group).

       <b>21</b>     The UID (GID) that was explicitly requested for a new user (group) is already in use.

       <b>22</b>     There is no available UID (GID) in the requested range.

       <b>23</b>     There is no group with the requested GID for the primary group for a new user.

       <b>31</b>     The chosen name for a new user or a new group does not conform to the selected naming rules.

       <b>32</b>     The home directory of a new user must be an absolute path.

       <b>33</b>     useradd returned exit code 19 "invalid user or group name".  That means the  user  or  group  name
              chosen does not fit useradd's restrictions and adduser cannot create the user.

       <b>41</b>     The group that was requested to be deleted is not empty.

       <b>42</b>     The user that was requested to be removed from a group is not a member in the first place.

       <b>43</b>     It is not possible to remove a user from its primary group, or no primary group selected for a new
              user by any method.

       <b>51</b>     Incorrect number or order of command line parameters detected.

       <b>52</b>     Incompatible options set in configuration file.

       <b>53</b>     Mutually incompatible command line options detected.

       <b>54</b>     <b>adduser</b> and <b>deluser</b> invoked as non-root and thus cannot work.

       <b>55</b>     <b>deluser</b> will refuse to delete the <u>root</u> account.

       <b>56</b>     A  function was requested that needs more packages to be installed.  See Recommends: and Suggests:
              of the adduser package.

       <b>61</b>     <b>Adduser</b> was aborted for some reason and tried to roll back  the  changes  that  were  done  during
              execution.

       <b>62</b>     Internal <b>adduser</b> error.  This should not happen.  Please try to reproduce the issue and file a bug
              report.

       <b>72</b>     Error accessing the configuration file(s).

       <b>73</b>     Error accessing a pool file.

       <b>74</b>     Error reading a pool file, syntax error in file.

       <b>75</b>     Error accessing auxiliary files.

       <b>81</b>     An  executable  that  is needed by <b>adduser</b> or <b>deluser</b> cannot be found. Check your installation and
              dependencies.

       <b>82</b>     Executing an external command returned some unexpected error.

       <b>83</b>     An external command was terminated with a signal.

       <b>84</b>     A syscall terminated with unexpected error.

       Or for many other yet undocumented reasons which are printed to console then.  You may then  consider  to
       increase a log level to make <b>adduser</b> more verbose.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>adduser</b>  needs  root  privileges  and  offers,  via  the  <b>--conf</b>  command  line  option  to use different
       configuration files.  Do not use <b><a href="../man8/sudo.8.html">sudo</a></b>(8) or similar tools to give  partial  privileges  to  <b>adduser</b>  with
       restricted command line parameters.  This is easy to circumvent and might allow users to create arbitrary
       accounts.   If  you  want this, consider writing your own wrapper script and giving privileges to execute
       that script.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Unfortunately, the term <u>system</u> <u>account</u> suffers from double use in Debian.  It both means an  account  for
       the actual Debian system, distinguishing itself from an <u>application</u> <u>account</u> which might exist in the user
       database of some application running on Debian.  A <u>system</u> <u>account</u> in this definition has the potential to
       log  in  to  the  actual  system, has a UID, can be member in system groups, can own files and processes.
       Debian Policy, au contraire, in its Chapter 9.2.2,  makes  a  distinguishment  of  <u>dynamically</u>  <u>allocated</u>
       <u>system</u>  <u>users</u> <u>and</u> <u>groups</u> and <u>dynamically</u> <u>allocated</u> <u>user</u> <u>accounts</u>, meaning in both cases special instances
       of <u>system</u> <u>accounts</u>.  Care must be taken to not confuse this terminology.  Since  <b>adduser</b>  and  <b><a href="../man8/deluser.8.html">deluser</a></b>(8)
       never  address  <u>application</u>  <u>accounts</u>  and  everything in this package concerns <u>system</u> <u>accounts</u> here, the
       usage of the terms <u>user</u> <u>account</u> and <u>system</u> <u>account</u> is actually not  ambiguous  in  the  context  of  this
       package.  For clarity, this document uses the definition <u>local</u> <u>system</u> <u>account</u> <u>or</u> <u>group</u> if the distinction
       to <u>application</u> <u>accounts</u> or accounts managed in a directory service is needed.

       <b>adduser</b>  used  to  have  the  vision  to be the universal front end to the various directory services for
       creation and deletion of regular and system accounts in Debian since the 1990ies.  This vision  has  been
       abandoned as of 2022.  The rationale behind this includes: that in practice, a small server system is not
       going  to  have  write  access  to  an  enterprise-wide  directory service anyway, that locally installed
       packages are hard to manage with centrally controlled system accounts, that enterprise directory services
       have their own management processes anyway and that the personpower of the <b>adduser</b> team is unlikely to be
       ever strong enough to write and maintain support  for  the  plethora  of  directory  services  that  need
       support.

       <b>adduser</b>  will constrict itself to being a policy layer for the management of local system accounts, using
       the tools from the <b>passwd</b> package for the actual work.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Inconsistent use of terminology around the term <u>system</u> <u>account</u> in docs and code is a bug.  Please  report
       this and allow us to improve our docs.

       <b>adduser</b>  takes  special  attention to be directly usable in Debian maintainer scripts without conditional
       wrappers, error suppression and other scaffolding.  The only thing that  the  package  maintainer  should
       need to code is a check for the presence of the executable in the postrm script.  The <b>adduser</b> maintainers
       consider  the need for additional scaffolding a bug and encourage their fellow Debian package maintainers
       to file bugs against the <b>adduser</b> package in this case.
