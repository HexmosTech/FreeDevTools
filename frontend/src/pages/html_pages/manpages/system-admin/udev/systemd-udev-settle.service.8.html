       systemd-udev-settle.service - Wait for all pending udev events to be handled

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       systemd-udev-settle.service

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This service calls <b>udevadm</b> <b>settle</b> to wait until all events that have been queued by <b><a href="../man7/udev.7.html">udev</a></b>(7) have been
       processed. It is a crude way to wait until "all" hardware has been discovered. Services may pull in this
       service and order themselves after it to wait for the udev queue to be empty.

       <u>Using</u> <u>this</u> <u>service</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>recommended.</u>  There can be no guarantee that hardware is fully discovered at
       any specific time, because the kernel does hardware detection asynchronously, and certain buses and
       devices take a very long time to become ready, and also additional hardware may be plugged in at any
       time. Instead, services should subscribe to udev events and react to any new hardware as it is
       discovered. Services that, based on configuration, expect certain devices to appear, may warn or report
       failure after a timeout. This timeout should be tailored to the hardware type. Waiting for
       systemd-udev-settle.service usually slows boot significantly, because it means waiting for all unrelated
       events too.
