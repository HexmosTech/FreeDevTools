</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       NetworkManager - network management daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>NetworkManager</b> <b>[OPTIONS...]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The NetworkManager daemon attempts to make networking configuration and operation as painless and
       automatic as possible by managing the primary network connection and other network interfaces, like
       Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Mobile Broadband devices. NetworkManager will connect any network device when a
       connection for that device becomes available, unless that behavior is disabled. Information about
       networking is exported via a D-Bus interface to any interested application, providing a rich API with
       which to inspect and control network settings and operation.

</pre><h4><b>DISPATCHER</b> <b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
       NetworkManager-dispatcher service can execute scripts for the user in response to network events. See
       <b><a href="../man8/NetworkManager-dispatcher.8.html">NetworkManager-dispatcher</a></b>(8) manual.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--version</b> | <b>-V</b>
           Print the NetworkManager software version and exit.

       <b>--help</b> | <b>-h</b>
           Print NetworkManager's available options and exit.

       <b>--no-daemon</b> | <b>-n</b>
           Do not daemonize.

       <b>--debug</b> | <b>-d</b>
           Do not daemonize, and direct log output to the controlling terminal in addition to syslog.

       <b>--pid-file</b> | <b>-p</b>
           Specify location of a PID file. The PID file is used for storing PID of the running process and
           prevents running multiple instances.

       <b>--state-file</b>
           Specify file for storing state of the NetworkManager persistently. If not specified, the default
           value of /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state is used.

       <b>--config</b>
           Specify configuration file to set up various settings for NetworkManager. If not specified, the
           default value of /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf is used with a fallback to the older
           'nm-system-settings.conf' if located in the same directory. See <b><a href="../man5/NetworkManager.conf.5.html">NetworkManager.conf</a></b>(5) for more
           information on configuration file.

       <b>--configure-and-quit</b> [initrd]
           Quit after all devices reach a stable state. The optional initrd parameter enables mode, where no
           processes are left running after NetworkManager stops, which is useful for running from an initial
           ramdisk on rearly boot.

       <b>--plugins</b>
           List plugins used to manage system-wide connection settings. This list has preference over plugins
           specified in the configuration file. See main.plugins setting in <b><a href="../man5/NetworkManager.conf.5.html">NetworkManager.conf</a></b>(5) for supported
           options.

       <b>--log-level</b>
           Sets how much information NetworkManager sends to the log destination (usually syslog's "daemon"
           facility). By default, only informational, warning, and error messages are logged. See the section on
           logging in <b><a href="../man5/NetworkManager.conf.5.html">NetworkManager.conf</a></b>(5) for more information.

       <b>--log-domains</b>
           A comma-separated list specifying which operations are logged to the log destination (usually
           syslog). By default, most domains are logging-enabled. See the section on logging in
           <b><a href="../man5/NetworkManager.conf.5.html">NetworkManager.conf</a></b>(5) for more information.

       <b>--print-config</b>
           Print the NetworkManager configuration to stdout and exit. See <b><a href="../man5/NetworkManager.conf.5.html">NetworkManager.conf</a></b>(5). This does not
           include connection profiles. View them with <b>nmcli</b> <b>connection</b>.

           This reads configuration files from disk. If NetworkManager is currently running, make sure that it
           has the same configuration loaded.

</pre><h4><b>UDEV</b> <b>PROPERTIES</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man7/udev.7.html">udev</a></b>(7) device manager is used for the network device discovery. The following property influences how
       NetworkManager manages the devices:

       <u>NM_UNMANAGED</u>
           If set to "1" or "true", the device is configured as unmanaged by NetworkManager. Note that the user
           still can explicitly overrule this configuration via means like <b>nmcli</b> <b>device</b> <b>set</b> <b>"$DEVICE"</b> <b>managed</b>
           <b>yes</b> or "device*.managed=1" in NetworkManager.conf.

       <u>ID_NET_MANAGED_BY</u>
           If <u>NM_UNMANAGED</u> is set, this has no effect. Otherwise, if the attribute is set to anything but
           "org.freedesktop.NetworkManager", the device is unmanaged.

       <u>NM_AUTO_DEFAULT_LINK_LOCAL_ONLY</u>
           If set to "1" or "true", the automatically generated connections "Wired connection N" will only
           enable link local addressing for IPv4 and IPv6. This can be useful on thunderbolt devices or
           host-to-host USB devices.

       <u>ID_NET_AUTO_LINK_LOCAL_ONLY</u>
           Honored and treated the same as if <u>NM_AUTO_DEFAULT_LINK_LOCAL_ONLY</u> were set.

       <u>ID_NET_DHCP_BROADCAST</u>
           If set to "1" or "true", use broadcast requests for DHCPv4 offers. This can make sense of devices
           that can't handle unicast messages until being configured.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       NetworkManager process handles the following signals:

       <u>SIGHUP</u>
           The signal causes a reload of NetworkManager's configuration. Note that not all configuration
           parameters can be changed at runtime and therefore some changes may be applied only after the next
           restart of the daemon. A SIGHUP also involves further reloading actions, like doing a DNS update and
           restarting the DNS plugin. The latter can be useful for example when using the dnsmasq plugin and
           changing its configuration in /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d. However, it also means this will shortly
           interrupt name resolution. In the future, there may be further actions added. A SIGHUP means to
           update NetworkManager configuration and reload everything that is supported. Note that this does not
           reload connections from disk. For that there is a D-Bus API and nmcli's reload action

       <u>SIGUSR1</u>
           The signal forces a rewrite of DNS configuration. Contrary to SIGHUP, this does not restart the DNS
           plugin and will not interrupt name resolution. When NetworkManager is not managing DNS, the signal
           forces a restart of operations that depend on the DNS configuration (like the resolution of the
           system hostname via reverse DNS, or the resolution of WireGuard peers); therefore, it can be used to
           tell NetworkManager that the content of resolv.conf was changed externally. In the future, further
           actions may be added. A SIGUSR1 means to write out data like resolv.conf, or refresh a cache. It is a
           subset of what is done for SIGHUP without reloading configuration from disk.

       <u>SIGUSR2</u>
           The signal has no effect at the moment but is reserved for future use.

       An alternative to a signal to reload configuration is the Reload D-Bus call. It allows for more
       fine-grained selection of what to reload, it only returns after the reload is complete, and it is guarded
       by PolicyKit.

</pre><h4><b>DEBUGGING</b></h4><pre>
       NetworkManager only configures your system. So when your networking setup doesn't work as expected, the
       first step is to look at your system to understand what is actually configured, and whether that is
       correct. The second step is to find out how to tell NetworkManager to do the right thing.

       You can for example try to <b>ping</b> hosts (by IP address or DNS name), look at <b>ip</b> <b>link</b> <b>show</b>, <b>ip</b> <b>address</b> <b>show</b>
       and <b>ip</b> <b>route</b> <b>show</b>, and look at <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> for name resolution issues. Also look at the connection
       profiles that you have configured in NetworkManager (<b>nmcli</b> <b>connection</b> and <b>nmcli</b> <b>connection</b> <b>show</b>
       <b>"$PROFILE"</b>) and the configured interfaces (<b>nmcli</b> <b>device</b>).

       If that does not suffice, look at the logfiles of NetworkManager. NetworkManager logs to syslog, so
       depending on your system configuration you can call <b>journalctl</b> to get the logs. By default,
       NetworkManager logs are not verbose and thus not very helpful for investigating a problem in detail. You
       can change the logging level at runtime with <b>nmcli</b> <b>general</b> <b>logging</b> <b>level</b> <b>TRACE</b> <b>domains</b> <b>ALL</b>. But usually a
       better way is to collect full logs from the start, by configuring level=TRACE in NetworkManager.conf. See
       <b><a href="../man5/NetworkManager.conf.5.html">NetworkManager.conf</a></b>(5) manual. Note that trace logs of NetworkManager are verbose and systemd-journald
       might rate limit some lines. Possibly disable rate limiting first with the RateLimitIntervalSec and
       RateLimitBurst options of journald (see <b><a href="../man5/journald.conf.5.html">journald.conf</a></b>(5) manual).

       NetworkManager does not log any secrets. However, you are advised to check whether anything private
       sensitive gets logged before posting. When reporting an issue, provide complete logs and avoid
       modifications (for privacy) that distort the meaning.

</pre><h4><b>/VAR/LIB/NETWORKMANAGER/SECRET_KEY</b> <b>AND</b> <b>/ETC/MACHINE-ID</b></h4><pre>
       The identity of a machine is important as various settings depend on it. For example,
       ipv6.addr-gen-mode=stable and ethernet.cloned-mac-address=stable generate identifiers by hashing the
       machine's identity. See also the connection.stable-id connection property which is a per-profile seed
       that gets hashed with the machine identity for generating such addresses and identifiers.

       If you backup and restore a machine, the identity of the machine probably should be preserved. In that
       case, preserve the files /var/lib/NetworkManager/secret_key and /etc/machine-id. On the other hand, if
       you clone a virtual machine, you probably want that the clone has a different identity. There is already
       existing tooling on Linux for handling <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> (see <b><a href="../man5/machine-id.5.html">machine-id</a></b>(5)).

       The identity of the machine is determined by the /var/lib/NetworkManager/secret_key. If such a file does
       not exist, NetworkManager will create a file with random content. To generate a new identity just delete
       the file and after restart a new file will be created. The file should be read-only to root and contain
       at least 16 bytes that will be used to seed the various places where a stable identifier is used.

       Since 1.16.0, NetworkManager supports a version 2 of secret-keys. For such keys
       /var/lib/NetworkManager/secret_key starts with ASCII "nm-v2:" followed by at least 32 bytes of random
       data. Also, recent versions of NetworkManager always create such kinds of secret-keys, when the file does
       not yet exist. With version 2 of the secret-key, <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> is also hashed as part of the generation
       for addresses and identifiers. The advantage is that you can keep /var/lib/NetworkManager/secret_key
       stable, and only regenerate <a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a> when cloning a VM.
