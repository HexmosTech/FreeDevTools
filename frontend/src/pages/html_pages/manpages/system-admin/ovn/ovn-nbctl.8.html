</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ovn-nbctl - Open Virtual Network northbound db management utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ovn-nbctl</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u> [<u>arg</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ovn-nbctl</b>  program configures the <b>OVN_Northbound</b> database by providing a high-level interface to its
       configuration database. See <b><a href="../man5/ovn-nb.5.html">ovn-nb</a></b>(5) for comprehensive documentation of the database schema.

       <b>ovn-nbctl</b> connects to an <b>ovsdb-server</b> process that maintains an  OVN_Northbound  configuration  database.
       Using this connection, it queries and possibly applies changes to the database, depending on the supplied
       commands.

       <b>ovn-nbctl</b>  can perform any number of commands in a single run, implemented as a single atomic transaction
       against the database.

       The <b>ovn-nbctl</b> command line begins with global options (see <b>OPTIONS</b> below for details). The global options
       are followed by one or more commands. Each command should begin with  <b>--</b>  by  itself  as  a  command-line
       argument,  to separate it from the following commands. (The <b>--</b> before the first command is optional.) The
       command itself starts with command-specific options, if  any,  followed  by  the  command  name  and  any
       arguments.

</pre><h4><b>DAEMON</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       When  it  is  invoked  in  the  most  ordinary  way, <b>ovn-nbctl</b> connects to an OVSDB server that hosts the
       northbound database, retrieves a partial copy of the database that is complete enough  to  do  its  work,
       sends  a  transaction  request  to  the  server, and receives and processes the serverâ€™s reply. In common
       interactive use, this is fine, but if the database is large, the step  in  which  <b>ovn-nbctl</b>  retrieves  a
       partial copy of the database can take a long time, which yields poor performance overall.

       To  improve  performance in such a case, <b>ovn-nbctl</b> offers a "daemon mode," in which the user first starts
       <b>ovn-nbctl</b> running in the background and afterward uses the daemon to  execute  operations.  Over  several
       <b>ovn-nbctl</b>  command  invocations, this performs better overall because it retrieves a copy of the database
       only once at the beginning, not once per program run.

       Use the <b>--detach</b> option to start an <b>ovn-nbctl</b> daemon. With this option, <b>ovn-nbctl</b> prints the  name  of  a
       control  socket  to stdout. The client should save this name in environment variable <b>OVN_NB_DAEMON</b>. Under
       the Bourne shell this might be done like this:

             export OVN_NB_DAEMON=$(ovn-nbctl --pidfile --detach)

       When <b>OVN_NB_DAEMON</b> is set, <b>ovn-nbctl</b> automatically and transparently  uses  the  daemon  to  execute  its
       commands.

       When the daemon is no longer needed, kill it and unset the environment variable, e.g.:

             kill $(cat $OVN_RUNDIR/ovn-nbctl.pid)
             unset OVN_NB_DAEMON

       When using daemon mode, an alternative to the <b>OVN_NB_DAEMON</b> environment variable is to specify a path for
       the  Unix  socket.  When  starting  the  ovn-nbctl  daemon, specify the <b>-u</b> option with a full path to the
       location of the socket file. Here is an exmple:

             ovn-nbctl --detach -u /tmp/mysock.ctl

       Then to connect to the running daemon, use the <b>-u</b> option with the full path to the  socket  created  when
       the daemon was started:

             ovn-nbctl -u /tmp/mysock.ctl show

     <u>Daemon</u> <u>Commands</u>

       Daemon  mode  is  internally  implemented  using  the same mechanism used by <b>ovn-appctl</b>. One may also use
       <b>ovn-appctl</b> directly with the following commands:

              <b>run</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u> [<u>arg</u>...] [<b>--</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u> [<u>arg</u>...] ...]
                     Instructs the daemon process to run one or more  <b>ovn-nbctl</b>  commands  described  above  and
                     reply with the results of running these commands. Accepts the <b>--no-wait</b>, <b>--wait</b>, <b>--timeout</b>,
                     <b>--dry-run</b>,  <b>--oneline</b>, and the options described under <b>Table</b> <b>Formatting</b> <b>Options</b> in addition
                     to the the command-specific options.

              <b>exit</b>   Causes <b>ovn-nbctl</b> to gracefully terminate.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options listed below affect the behavior of <b>ovn-nbctl</b> as  a  whole.  Some  individual  commands  also
       accept  their  own  options,  which  are  given just before the command name. If the first command on the
       command line has options, then those options must be separated from the global options by <b>--</b>.

       <b>ovn-nbctl</b> also accepts options from the <b>OVN_NBCTL_OPTIONS</b> environment variable, in the same format as  on
       the command line. Options from the command line override those in the environment.

              <b>--no-wait</b> | <b>--wait=none</b>
              <b>--wait=sb</b>
              <b>--wait=hv</b>
                   These options control whether and how <b>ovn-nbctl</b> waits for the OVN system to become up-to-date
                   with changes made in an <b>ovn-nbctl</b> invocation.

                   By default, or if <b>--no-wait</b> or <b>--wait=none</b>, <b>ovn-nbctl</b> exits immediately after confirming that
                   changes have been committed to the northbound database, without waiting.

                   With  <b>--wait=sb</b>,  before  <b>ovn-nbctl</b>  exits,  it  waits for <b>ovn-northd</b> to bring the southbound
                   database up-to-date with the northbound database updates.

                   With  <b>--wait=hv</b>,  before  <b>ovn-nbctl</b>  exits,  it  additionally  waits  for  all  OVN   chassis
                   (hypervisors  and  gateways) to become up-to-date with the northbound database updates. (This
                   can become an indefinite wait if any chassis is malfunctioning.)

                   Ordinarily, <b>--wait=sb</b> or <b>--wait=hv</b> only waits for changes by the current <b>ovn-nbctl</b> invocation
                   to take effect. This means that, if none of the commands supplied  to  <b>ovn-nbctl</b>  change  the
                   database,  then  the  command  does  not  wait  at all. Use the <b>sync</b> command to override this
                   behavior.

              <b>--db</b> <u>database</u>
                   The OVSDB database remote to contact. If the <b>OVN_NB_DB</b> environment variable is set, its value
                   is used as the default. Otherwise, the default is <b>unix:/ovnnb_db.sock</b>, but  this  default  is
                   unlikely to be useful outside of single-machine OVN test environments.

              <b>--leader-only</b>
              <b>--no-leader-only</b>
                   By  default,  or  with  <b>--leader-only</b>,  when  the  database  server  is a clustered database,
                   <b>ovn-nbctl</b> will avoid servers other than the cluster leader. This ensures that any  data  that
                   <b>ovn-nbctl</b>  reads  and  reports  is  up-to-date. With <b>--no-leader-only</b>, <b>ovn-nbctl</b> will use any
                   server in the cluster, which means that for read-only transactions it can report and  act  on
                   stale   data  (transactions  that  modify  the  database  are  always  serialized  even  with
                   <b>--no-leader-only</b>).  Refer  to  <b>Understanding</b>  <b>Cluster</b>  <b>Consistency</b>  in  <b><a href="../man7/ovsdb.7.html">ovsdb</a></b>(7)   for   more
                   information.

              <b>--shuffle-remotes</b>
              <b>--no-shuffle-remotes</b>
                   By default, or with <b>--shuffle-remotes</b>, when there are multiple remotes specified in the OVSDB
                   connection  string  specified by <b>--db</b> or the <b>OVN_NB_DB</b> environment variable, the order of the
                   remotes will be shuffled before the client tries to connect. The  remotes  will  be  shuffled
                   only  once to a new order before the first connection attempt. The following retries, if any,
                   will follow the same new order. The default behavior is to make sure clients of  a  clustered
                   database  can  distribute  evenly  to  all members of the cluster. With <b>--no-shuffle-remotes</b>,
                   <b>ovn-nbctl</b> will use the original order specified in the connection  string  to  connect.  This
                   allows user to specify the preferred order, which is particularly useful for testing.

              <b>--no-syslog</b>
                   By  default, <b>ovn-nbctl</b> logs its arguments and the details of any changes that it makes to the
                   system log. This option disables this logging.

                   This option is equivalent to <b>--verbose=nbctl:syslog:warn</b>.

              <b>--oneline</b>
                   Modifies the output format so that the output for each command is printed on a  single  line.
                   New-line  characters  that  would  otherwise separate lines are printed as \fB\\n\fR, and any
                   instances of \fB\\\fR that would otherwise appear in the output are doubled. Prints  a  blank
                   line  for  each  command  that  has  no output. This option does not affect the formatting of
                   output from the <b>list</b> or <b>find</b> commands; see <b>Table</b> <b>Formatting</b> <b>Options</b> below.

              <b>--dry-run</b>
                   Prevents <b>ovn-nbctl</b> from actually modifying the database.

              <b>-t</b> <u>secs</u>
              <b>--timeout=</b><u>secs</u>
                   By default, or with a <u>secs</u> of <b>0</b>, <b>ovn-nbctl</b> waits forever for a response  from  the  database.
                   This  option  limits runtime to approximately <u>secs</u> seconds. If the timeout expires, <b>ovn-nbctl</b>
                   will exit with a <b>SIGALRM</b> signal. (A timeout would normally happen only if the database cannot
                   be contacted, or if the system is overloaded.)

              <b>--print-wait-time</b>
                   When <b>--wait</b> is specified, the option <b>--print-wait-time</b> can be used to print the time spent on
                   waiting, depending on the value specified in  <b>--wait</b> option. If <b>--wait=sb</b>  is  specified,  it
                   prints  "ovn-northd  delay  before  processing",  which is the time between the Northbound DB
                   update by the command and the moment when  <b>ovn-northd</b> starts processing the update, and "ovn-
                   northd completion", which is the time between the Northbound DB update and  the  moment  when
                   <b>ovn-northd</b>  completes  the Southbound DB updating successfully. If <b>--wait=hv</b> is specified, in
                   addition to the above information, it also prints "ovn-controller(s)  completion",  which  is
                   the time between the Northbound DB update and the moment when the slowest hypervisor finishes
                   processing the update.

   <b>Daemon</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--pidfile</b>[<b>=</b><u>pidfile</u>]
              Causes  a  file (by default, <u>program</u><b>.pid</b>) to be created indicating the PID of the running process.
              If the <u>pidfile</u> argument is not specified, or if it does not begin with <b>/</b>, then it is created in .

              If <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, no pidfile is created.

       <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b>
              By default, when <b>--pidfile</b> is specified and the specified pidfile already exists and is locked  by
              a running process, the daemon refuses to start. Specify <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b> to cause it to instead
              overwrite the pidfile.

              When <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, this option has no effect.

       <b>--detach</b>
              Runs  this  program  as  a background process. The process forks, and in the child it starts a new
              session, closes the standard file descriptors (which has the side effect of disabling  logging  to
              the  console),  and  changes  its  current directory to the root (unless <b>--no-chdir</b> is specified).
              After the child completes its initialization, the parent exits.

       <b>--monitor</b>
              Creates an additional process to monitor this program. If it dies due to a signal that indicates a
              programming error (<b>SIGABRT</b>,  <b>SIGALRM</b>,  <b>SIGBUS</b>,  <b>SIGFPE</b>,  <b>SIGILL</b>,  <b>SIGPIPE</b>,  <b>SIGSEGV</b>,  <b>SIGXCPU</b>,  or
              <b>SIGXFSZ</b>) then the monitor process starts a new copy of it. If the daemon dies or exits for another
              reason, the monitor process exits.

              This option is normally used with <b>--detach</b>, but it also functions without it.

       <b>--no-chdir</b>
              By  default,  when  <b>--detach</b> is specified, the daemon changes its current working directory to the
              root directory after it  detaches.  Otherwise,  invoking  the  daemon  from  a  carelessly  chosen
              directory  would  prevent  the  administrator  from  unmounting  the  file  system that holds that
              directory.

              Specifying <b>--no-chdir</b> suppresses this behavior, preventing the daemon from  changing  its  current
              working  directory.  This  may be useful for collecting core files, since it is common behavior to
              write core dumps into the current working directory and the root directory is not a good directory
              to use.

              This option has no effect when <b>--detach</b> is not specified.

       <b>--no-self-confinement</b>
              By default this daemon will try to  self-confine  itself  to  work  with  files  under  well-known
              directories  determined at build time. It is better to stick with this default behavior and not to
              use this flag unless some other Access Control is used to confine daemon. Note that in contrast to
              other access control implementations that are typically enforced from kernel-space  (e.g.  DAC  or
              MAC),  self-confinement  is  imposed  from  the  user-space  daemon itself and hence should not be
              considered as a full confinement strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional layer  of
              security.

       <b>--user=</b><u>user</u><b>:</b><u>group</u>
              Causes  this program to run as a different user specified in <u>user</u><b>:</b><u>group</u>, thus dropping most of the
              root privileges. Short forms <u>user</u> and <b>:</b><u>group</u> are also allowed, with current user or group assumed,
              respectively. Only daemons started by the root user accepts this argument.

              On Linux, daemons will be granted <b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b>  and  <b>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES</b>  before  dropping  root
              privileges.  Daemons  that  interact  with a datapath, such as <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>, will be granted three
              additional capabilities, namely <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>, <b>CAP_NET_BROADCAST</b> and <b>CAP_NET_RAW</b>.  The  capability
              change will apply even if the new user is root.

              On  Windows,  this option is not currently supported. For security reasons, specifying this option
              will cause the daemon process not to start.

   <b>Logging</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-v</b>[<u>spec</u>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<u>spec</u>]
            Sets logging levels. Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log level for every module and destination  to  <b>dbg</b>.
            Otherwise,  <u>spec</u>  is  a  list  of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from each
            category below:

            â€¢      A valid module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b> command on <b><a href="../man8/ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl</a></b>(8), limits  the  log
                   level change to the specified module.

            â€¢      <b>syslog</b>,  <b>console</b>,  or  <b>file</b>,  to limit the log level change to only to the system log, to the
                   console, or to a file, respectively.  (If  <b>--detach</b>  is  specified,  the  daemon  closes  its
                   standard file descriptors, so logging to the console will have no effect.)

                   On  Windows  platform,  <b>syslog</b>  is  accepted  as  a  word  and  is only useful along with the
                   <b>--syslog-target</b> option (the word has no effect otherwise).

            â€¢      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to control the log level. Messages of the given  severity
                   or  higher  will  be logged, and messages of lower severity will be filtered out. <b>off</b> filters
                   out all messages. See <b><a href="../man8/ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl</a></b>(8) for a definition of each log level.

            Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

            Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>, logging to a file will not take place  unless  <b>--log-file</b>
            is also specified (see below).

            For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
            Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to <b>--verbose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
            Sets  the  log  pattern  for <u>destination</u> to <u>pattern</u>. Refer to <b><a href="../man8/ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl</a></b>(8) for a description of the
            valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
            Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. <u>facility</u> can be one of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>,
            <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>, <b>news</b>, <b>uucp</b>, <b>clock</b>, <b>ftp</b>, <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>,  <b>clock2</b>,  <b>local0</b>,  <b>local1</b>,  <b>local2</b>,  <b>local3</b>,
            <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b> or <b>local7</b>. If this option is not specified, <b>daemon</b> is used as the default for
            the  local  system  syslog and <b>local0</b> is used while sending a message to the target provided via the
            <b>--syslog-target</b> option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
            Enables logging to a file. If <u>file</u> is specified, then it is used as the exact name for the log file.
            The default log file name used if <u>file</u> is omitted is <b>/var/log/ovn/</b><u>program</u><b>.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><u>host</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>
            Send syslog messages to UDP <u>port</u> on <u>host</u>, in addition to the system  syslog.  The  <u>host</u>  must  be  a
            numerical IP address, not a hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><u>method</u>
            Specify  <u>method</u>  as  how  syslog  messages  should be sent to syslog daemon. The following forms are
            supported:

            â€¢      <b>libc</b>, to use the libc <b>syslog()</b> function. Downside of using this options  is  that  libc  adds
                   fixed  prefix  to every message before it is actually sent to the syslog daemon over <b>/dev/log</b>
                   UNIX domain socket.

            â€¢      <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>, to use a UNIX domain socket directly. It is possible to specify arbitrary  message
                   format  with  this  option.  However,  <b>rsyslogd</b>  <b>8.9</b> and older versions use hard coded parser
                   function anyway that limits UNIX domain socket use. If you  want  to  use  arbitrary  message
                   format with older <b>rsyslogd</b> versions, then use UDP socket to localhost IP address instead.

            â€¢      <b>udp:</b><u>ip</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>,  to  use  a UDP socket. With this method it is possible to use arbitrary message
                   format also with  older  <b>rsyslogd</b>.  When  sending  syslog  messages  over  UDP  socket  extra
                   precaution  needs to be taken into account, for example, syslog daemon needs to be configured
                   to listen on the specified UDP port, accidental iptables  rules  could  be  interfering  with
                   local  syslog  traffic  and there are some security considerations that apply to UDP sockets,
                   but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

            â€¢      <b>null</b>, to discard all messages logged to syslog.

            The default is taken from the <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b> environment variable; if it is unset, the default is
            <b>libc</b>.

   <b>Table</b> <b>Formatting</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options control the format of output from the <b>list</b> and <b>find</b> commands.

              <b>-f</b> <u>format</u>
              <b>--format=</b><u>format</u>
                   Sets the type of table formatting. The following types of <u>format</u> are available:

                   <b>table</b>  2-D text tables with aligned columns.

                   <b>list</b> (default)
                          A list with one column per line and rows separated by a blank line.

                   <b>html</b>   HTML tables.

                   <b>csv</b>    Comma-separated values as defined in RFC 4180.

                   <b>json</b>   JSON format as defined in RFC 4627. The output is a sequence of JSON objects, each  of
                          which  corresponds  to  one table. Each JSON object has the following members with the
                          noted values:

                          <b>caption</b>
                                 The tableâ€™s caption. This member is omitted if the table has no caption.

                          <b>headings</b>
                                 An array with one element per table column. Each  array  element  is  a  string
                                 giving the corresponding columnâ€™s heading.

                          <b>data</b>   An array with one element per table row. Each element is also an array with one
                                 element per table column. The elements of this second-level array are the cells
                                 that  constitute  the  table. Cells that represent OVSDB data or data types are
                                 expressed in the format described in the OVSDB specification; other  cells  are
                                 simply expressed as text strings.

              <b>-d</b> <u>format</u>
              <b>--data=</b><u>format</u>
                   Sets the formatting for cells within output tables unless the table format is set to <b>json</b>, in
                   which  case  <b>json</b>  formatting  is  always  used when formatting cells. The following types of
                   <u>format</u> are available:

                   <b>string</b> (default)
                          The simple format described in the <b>Database</b> <b>Values</b> section of <b><a href="../man8/ovs-vsctl.8.html">ovs-vsctl</a></b>(8).

                   <b>bare</b>   The simple format with punctuation stripped off: <b>[]</b> and <b>{}</b> are  omitted  around  sets,
                          maps,  and  empty columns, items within sets and maps are space-separated, and strings
                          are never quoted. This format may be easier for scripts to parse.

                   <b>json</b>   The RFC 4627 JSON format as described above.

              <b>--no-headings</b>
                   This option suppresses the heading row that otherwise appears  in  the  first  row  of  table
                   output.

              <b>--pretty</b>
                   By  default,  JSON  in output is printed as compactly as possible. This option causes JSON in
                   output to be printed in a more readable fashion. Members of objects and  elements  of  arrays
                   are printed one per line, with indentation.

                   This option does not affect JSON in tables, which is always printed compactly.

              <b>--bare</b>
                   Equivalent to <b>--format=list</b> <b>--data=bare</b> <b>--no-headings</b>.

   <b>PKI</b> <b>Options</b>
       PKI configuration is required to use SSL/TLS for the connection to the database.

              <b>-p</b> <u>privkey.pem</u>
              <b>--private-key=</b><u>privkey.pem</u>
                   Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used as identity for outgoing SSL/TLS
                   connections.

              <b>-c</b> <u>cert.pem</u>
              <b>--certificate=</b><u>cert.pem</u>
                   Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the private key specified on  <b>-p</b>
                   or  <b>--private-key</b>  to  be  trustworthy.  The  certificate  must  be signed by the certificate
                   authority (CA) that the peer in SSL/TLS connections will use to verify it.

              <b>-C</b> <u>cacert.pem</u>
              <b>--ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
                   Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate for verifying  certificates  presented  to
                   this  program  by  SSL/TLS peers. (This may be the same certificate that SSL/TLS peers use to
                   verify the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or <b>--certificate</b>,  or  it  may  be  a  different  one,
                   depending on the PKI design in use.)

              <b>-C</b> <b>none</b>
              <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
                   Disables  verification of certificates presented by SSL/TLS peers. This introduces a security
                   risk, because it means that certificates cannot be verified to  be  those  of  known  trusted
                   hosts.

              <b>--bootstrap-ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
                     When  <u>cacert.pem</u> exists, this option has the same effect as <b>-C</b> or <b>--ca-cert</b>. If it does not
                     exist, then the executable will attempt to obtain the CA certificate from the SSL/TLS  peer
                     on  its first SSL/TLS connection and save it to the named PEM file. If it is successful, it
                     will immediately  drop  the  connection  and  reconnect,  and  from  then  on  all  SSL/TLS
                     connections  must  be  authenticated  by  a  certificate  signed by the CA certificate thus
                     obtained.

                     This option exposes the SSL/TLS connection to  a  man-in-the-middle  attack  obtaining  the
                     initial CA certificate, but it may be useful for bootstrapping.

                     This  option  is  only  useful  if the SSL/TLS peer sends its CA certificate as part of the
                     SSL/TLS certificate chain. SSL/TLS protocols do not require  the  server  to  send  the  CA
                     certificate.

                     This option is mutually exclusive with <b>-C</b> and <b>--ca-cert</b>.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b>
            Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
            Prints version information to the console.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following sections describe the commands that <b>ovn-nbctl</b> supports.

   <b>General</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>init</b>   Initializes  the  database,  if  it  is  empty. If the database has already been initialized, this
              command has no effect.

       <b>show</b> <b>[</b><u>switch</u> <b>|</b> <u>router</u><b>]</b>
              Prints a brief overview of the database contents. If <u>switch</u> is provided, only records  related  to
              that  logical switch are shown. If <u>router</u> is provided, only records related to that logical router
              are shown.

   <b>Logical</b> <b>Switch</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>ls-add</b> Creates a new, unnamed logical switch, which initially has no ports. The switch does  not  have  a
              name, other commands must refer to this switch by its UUID.

       [<b>--may-exist</b> | <b>--add-duplicate</b>] <b>ls-add</b> <u>switch</u>
              Creates a new logical switch named <u>switch</u>, which initially has no ports.

              The  OVN  northbound  database  schema does not require logical switch names to be unique, but the
              whole point to the names is to provide an easy way for humans to refer  to  the  switches,  making
              duplicate  names  unhelpful.  Thus,  without  any  options, this command regards it as an error if
              <u>switch</u> is a duplicate name. With <b>--may-exist</b>, adding a duplicate name succeeds but does not create
              a new logical switch. With <b>--add-duplicate</b>, the command really creates a new logical switch with a
              duplicate name. It is an error to specify both options. If there  are  multiple  logical  switches
              with a duplicate name, configure the logical switches using the UUID instead of the <u>switch</u> name.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>ls-del</b> <u>switch</u>
              Deletes <u>switch</u>. It is an error if <u>switch</u> does not exist, unless <b>--if-exists</b> is specified.

       <b>ls-list</b>
              Lists all existing switches on standard output, one per line.

   <b>ACL</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands operates on ACL objects for a given <u>entity</u>. The <u>entity</u> can be either a logical switch or a
       port  group.  The  <u>entity</u>  can be specified as uuid or name. The <b>--type</b> option can be used to specify the
       type of the <u>entity</u>, in case both a logical switch and a port groups exist with the  same  name  specified
       for <u>entity</u>. <b>type</b> must be either <b>switch</b> or <b>port-group</b>.

              [<b>--type=</b>{<b>switch</b> | <b>port-group</b>}] [<b>--log</b>] [<b>--meter=</b><u>meter</u>] [<b>--severity=</b><u>severity</u>] [<b>--name=</b><u>name</u>]
              [<b>--label=</b><u>label</u>] [<b>--sample-new=</b><u>sample</u>] [<b>--sample-est=</b><u>sample</u>] [<b>--may-exist</b>] [<b>--apply-after-lb</b>]
              [<b>--tier</b>] <b>acl-add</b> <u>entity</u> <u>direction</u> <u>priority</u> <u>match</u> <u>verdict</u>
                     Adds the specified ACL to <u>entity</u>. <u>direction</u> must be either <b>from-lport</b> or <b>to-lport</b>. <u>priority</u>
                     must  be between <b>0</b> and <b>32767</b>, inclusive. A full description of the fields are in <b><a href="../man5/ovn-nb.5.html">ovn-nb</a></b>(5).
                     If <b>--may-exist</b> is specified, adding a duplicated ACL succeeds but the  ACL  is  not  really
                     created. Without <b>--may-exist</b>, adding a duplicated ACL results in error.

                     The  <b>--log</b>  option  enables  packet  logging for the ACL. The options <b>--severity</b> and <b>--name</b>
                     specify a severity and name, respectively, for log entries (and also enable  logging).  The
                     severity  must  be  one  of  <b>alert</b>,  <b>warning</b>,  <b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>debug</b>. If a severity is not
                     specified, the default is <b>info</b>. The <b>--meter=</b><u>meter</u>  option  is  used  to  rate-limit  packet
                     logging. The <u>meter</u> argument names a meter configured by <b>meter-add</b>.

                     The  <b>--sample-new</b>  (and optionally <b>--sample-est</b>) enable ACL sampling. A valid uuid of a row
                     of the <b>Sample</b> table must be provided.

                     The <b>--apply-after-lb</b> option sets <b>apply-after-lb=true</b> in  the  <b>options</b>  column  of  the  <b>ACL</b>
                     table.  As  the option name suggests, the ACL will be applied after the logical switch load
                     balancer stage.

                     The <b>--tier</b> option sets the ACLâ€™s tier to the specified value. For  more  information  about
                     ACL tiers, see the documentation for the <b><a href="../man5/ovn-nb.5.html">ovn-nb</a></b>(5) database.

              [<b>--type=</b>{<b>switch</b> | <b>port-group</b>}] [<b>--tier</b>] <b>acl-del</b> <u>entity</u> [<u>direction</u> [<u>priority</u> <u>match</u>]]
                     Deletes  ACLs  from  <u>entity</u>.  If  only <u>entity</u> is supplied, all the ACLs from the <u>entity</u> are
                     deleted. If <u>direction</u> is also specified, then all the  flows  in  that  direction  will  be
                     deleted  from  the <u>entity</u>. If all the fields are given, then a single flow that matches all
                     the fields will be deleted.

                     If the <b>--tier</b> option is provided, then only ACLs of the given tier value will  be  deleted,
                     in addition to whatever other criteria have been provided.

              [<b>--type=</b>{<b>switch</b> | <b>port-group</b>}] <b>acl-list</b> <u>entity</u>
                     Lists the ACLs on <u>entity</u>.

   <b>Logical</b> <b>Switch</b> <b>QoS</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>Commands</b>
       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>qos-add</b> <u>switch</u> <u>direction</u> <u>priority</u> <u>match</u> [<b>mark=</b><u>mark</u>] [<b>dscp=</b><u>dscp</u>] [<b>rate=</b><u>rate</u> [<b>burst=</b><u>burst</u>]]
              Adds  QoS  marking  and metering rules to <u>switch</u>. <u>direction</u> must be either <b>from-lport</b> or <b>to-lport</b>.
              <u>priority</u> must be between <b>0</b> and <b>32767</b>, inclusive.

              If <b>dscp=</b><u>dscp</u> is specified, then matching packets will have DSCP  marking  applied.  <u>dscp</u>  must  be
              between  <b>0</b>  and  <b>63</b>, inclusive. If <b>rate=</b><u>rate</u> is specified then matching packets will have metering
              applied at <u>rate</u> kbps. If metering is configured, then <b>burst=</b><u>burst</u> specifies the burst  rate  limit
              in  kilobits.  <b>dscp</b>  and/or  <b>rate</b> are required arguments. If <b>mark=</b><u>mark</u> is specified, then matching
              packets will be marked (through <b>pkt.mark</b>). <u>mark</u> must be a positive integer.

              If <b>--may-exist</b> is specified, adding a duplicated QoS rule succeeds but the QoS rule is not  really
              created. Without <b>--may-exist</b>, adding a duplicated QoS rule results in error.

       <b>qos-del</b> <u>switch</u> [<u>direction</u> [<u>priority</u> <u>match</u>]]
              Deletes  QoS  rules  from  <u>switch</u>.  If only <u>switch</u> is supplied, all the QoS rules from the logical
              switch are deleted. If <u>direction</u> is also specified, then all the flows in that direction  will  be
              deleted  from  the logical switch. If all the fields are supplied, then a single flow that matches
              the given fields will be deleted.

              If <u>switch</u> and <u>uuid</u> are supplied, then the QoS rule with specified uuid is deleted.

       <b>qos-list</b> <u>switch</u>
              Lists the QoS rules on <u>switch</u>.

   <b>Meter</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>meter-add</b> <u>name</u> <u>action</u> <u>rate</u> <u>unit</u> [<u>burst</u>]
              Adds the specified meter. <u>name</u> must be a unique name to identify this meter. The  <u>action</u>  argument
              specifies what should happen when this meter is exceeded. The only supported action is <b>drop</b>.

              The  <u>unit</u>  specifies  the unit for the <u>rate</u> argument; valid values are <b>kbps</b> and <b>pktps</b> for kilobits
              per second and packets per second, respectively. The <u>burst</u> option  configures  the  maximum  burst
              allowed  for  the  band  in  kilobits  or packets depending on whether the <u>unit</u> chosen was <b>kbps</b> or
              <b>pktps</b>, respectively. If a burst is not supplied, the switch is  free  to  select  some  reasonable
              value depending on its configuration.

              <b>ovn-nbctl</b>  only  supports adding a meter with a single band, but the other commands support meters
              with multiple bands.

              Names that start with "__" (two underscores) are reserved for internal use by  OVN,  so  <b>ovn-nbctl</b>
              does not allow adding them.

       <b>meter-del</b> [<u>name</u>]
              Deletes  meters. By default, all meters are deleted. If <u>name</u> is supplied, only the meter with that
              name will be deleted.

       <b>meter-list</b>
              Lists all meters.

   <b>Logical</b> <b>Switch</b> <b>Port</b> <b>Commands</b>
       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>lsp-add</b> <u>switch</u> <u>port</u>
              Creates on <u>lswitch</u> a new logical switch port named <u>port</u>.

              It is an error if a logical port named <u>port</u>  already  exists,  unless  <b>--may-exist</b>  is  specified.
              Regardless  of  <b>--may-exist</b>,  it  is an error if the existing port is in some logical switch other
              than <u>switch</u> or if it has a parent port.

       [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>lsp-add</b> <u>switch</u> <u>port</u> <u>parent</u> <u>tag_request</u>
              Creates on <u>switch</u> a logical switch port named <u>port</u> that is a child of <u>parent</u>  that  is  identified
              with  VLAN  ID  <u>tag_request</u>,  which  must  be  between <b>0</b> and <b>4095</b>, inclusive. If <u>tag_request</u> is <b>0</b>,
              <b>ovn-northd</b> generates a tag that is unique in the scope of <u>parent</u>. This is useful in cases such  as
              virtualized  container  environments  where  Open vSwitch does not have a direct connection to the
              containerâ€™s port and it must be shared with the virtual machineâ€™s port.

              It is an error if a logical port named <u>port</u>  already  exists,  unless  <b>--may-exist</b>  is  specified.
              Regardless  of <b>--may-exist</b>, it is an error if the existing port is not in <u>switch</u> or if it does not
              have the specified <u>parent</u> and <u>tag_request</u>.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>lsp-del</b> <u>port</u>
              Deletes <u>port</u>. It is an error if <u>port</u> does not exist, unless <b>--if-exists</b> is specified.

       <b>lsp-list</b> <u>switch</u>
              Lists all the logical switch ports within <u>switch</u> on standard output, one per line.

       <b>lsp-get-parent</b> <u>port</u>
              If set, get the parent port of <u>port</u>. If not set, print nothing.

       <b>lsp-get-tag</b> <u>port</u>
              If set, get the tag for <u>port</u> traffic. If not set, print nothing.

       <b>lsp-set-addresses</b> <u>port</u> [<u>address</u>]...
              Sets the addresses associated with <u>port</u> to <u>address</u>. Each <u>address</u> should be one of the following:

              an Ethernet address, optionally followed by a space and one or more IP addresses
                     OVN delivers packets for the Ethernet address to this port.

              <b>unknown</b>
                     OVN delivers unicast Ethernet packets whose destination MAC address is not in  any  logical

              <b>dynamic</b>
                     Use  this  keyword  to make <b>ovn-northd</b> generate a globally unique MAC address and choose an
                     unused IPv4  address  with  the  logical  portâ€™s  subnet  and  store  them  in  the  portâ€™s
                     <b>dynamic_addresses</b> column.

              <b>router</b> Accepted  only  when the <b>type</b> of the logical switch port is <b>router</b>. This indicates that the

                     connected logical router port, as specified by <b>router-port</b> in <b>lsp-set-options</b>.

              Multiple addresses may be set. If no <u>address</u> argument  is  given,  <u>port</u>  will  have  no  addresses
              associated with it.

       <b>lsp-get-addresses</b> <u>port</u>
              Lists all the addresses associated with <u>port</u> on standard output, one per line.

       <b>lsp-set-port-security</b> <u>port</u> [<u>addrs</u>]...
              Sets  the port security addresses associated with <u>port</u> to <u>addrs</u>. Multiple sets of addresses may be
              set by using multiple <u>addrs</u> arguments. If no <u>addrs</u> argument is given,  <u>port</u>  will  not  have  port
              security enabled.

              Port  security limits the addresses from which a logical port may send packets and to which it may
              receive  packets.  See  the  <b><a href="../man5/ovn-nb.5.html">ovn-nb</a></b>(5)  documentation  for  the  <b>port_security</b>   column   in   the

       <b>lsp-get-up</b> <u>port</u>
              Prints the state of <u>port</u>, either <b>up</b> or <b>down</b>.

       <b>lsp-set-enabled</b> <u>port</u> <u>state</u>
              Set  the  administrative  state  of  <u>port</u>, either <b>enabled</b> or <b>disabled</b>. When a port is disabled, no
              traffic is allowed into or out of the port.

       <b>lsp-get-enabled</b> <u>port</u>
              Prints the administrative state of <u>port</u>, either <b>enabled</b> or <b>disabled</b>.

       <b>lsp-set-type</b> <u>port</u> <u>type</u> [<b>peer=</b><u>peer</u>]
              Set the type for the logical port. The type must be one of the following:

              <b>(empty</b> <b>string)</b>
                     A VM (or VIF) interface.

              <b>router</b> A connection to a logical router.

              <b>switch</b> A connection to another logical switch. The optional argument  <b>peer</b>  identifies  a  logical
                     switch port that connects to this one.

                     All  logical  switch  ports of that type have implicit â€™unknownâ€™ addresses and FDB learning
                     enabled (unless port security is set). This comes with all the positive and negative  sides
                     of  the â€™unknownâ€™ address. Static addresses-to-port mappings donâ€™t need to be maintained on
                     each node and only the actually used mappings are learned, but at a  cost  of  broadcasting
                     packets for which the destination address is not learned yet.

                     FDB  learning  will  also  cause not learned yet packets to be sent to controller from each
                     switch-switch connection they traverse. This  should  be  taken  into  consideration  while
                     planning to have many directly connected switches within a single availability zone.

              <b>localnet</b>
                     A  connection  to a locally accessible network from each ovn-controller instance. A logical
                     switch can only have a single  localnet  port  attached.  This  is  used  to  model  direct
                     connectivity to an existing network.

              <b>localport</b>
                     A  connection to a local VIF. Traffic that arrives on a localport is never forwarded over a
                     tunnel to another chassis. These ports are present on  every  chassis  and  have  the  same
                     address  in  all  of them. This is used to model connectivity to local services that run on
                     every hypervisor.

              <b>l2gateway</b>
                     A connection to a physical network.

              <b>vtep</b>   A port to a logical switch on a VTEP gateway.

       <b>lsp-get-type</b> <u>port</u>
              Get the type for the logical port.

       <b>lsp-set-options</b> <u>port</u> [<u>key=value</u>]...

              Get the type-specific options for the logical port.

       <b>lsp-set-dhcpv4-options</b> <u>port</u> <u>dhcp_options</u>
              Set the DHCPv4 options for the logical port. The <u>dhcp_options</u> is a UUID referring to a set of DHCP
              options in the <b>DHCP_Options</b> table.

       <b>lsp-get-dhcpv4-options</b> <u>port</u>
              Get the configured DHCPv4 options for the logical port.

              Set the DHCPv6 options for the logical port. The <u>dhcp_options</u> is a UUID referring to a set of DHCP
              options in the <b>DHCP_Options</b> table.

       <b>lsp-get-dhcpv6-options</b> <u>port</u>
              Get the configured DHCPv6 options for the logical port.

              Detaches the mirror <u>m</u> from the logical port <u>port</u>.

   <b>Forwarding</b> <b>Group</b> <b>Commands</b>
       [<b>--liveness</b>]<b>fwd-group-add</b> <u>group</u> <u>switch</u> <u>vip</u> <u>vmac</u> <u>ports</u>
              Creates a new forwarding group named <u>group</u> as the name with the provided <u>vip</u> and <u>vmac</u>. <u>vip</u>  should
              be  a  virtual IP address and <u>vmac</u> should be a virtual MAC address to access the forwarding group.
              <u>ports</u> are the logical switch port names that are put in the forwarding group. Example for <u>ports</u> is
              lsp1 lsp2 ... Traffic destined to virtual IP of the forwarding group will be load balanced to  all
              the child ports.

              When  <b>--liveness</b>  is  specified then child ports are expected to be bound to external devices like
              routers. BFD should be configured between hypervisors and the external  devices.  The  child  port
              selection will become dependent on BFD status with its external device.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>fwd-group-del</b> <u>group</u>
               Deletes <u>group</u>. It is an error if <u>group</u> does not exist, unless <b>--if-exists</b> is specified.

       <b>fwd-group-list</b> [<u>switch</u>]
              Lists  all  existing  forwarding  groups,  If  <u>switch</u> is specified then only the forwarding groups
              configured for <u>switch</u> will be listed.

   <b>Logical</b> <b>Router</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>lr-add</b> Creates a new, unnamed logical router, which initially has no ports. The router does  not  have  a
              name, other commands must refer to this router by its UUID.

       [<b>--may-exist</b> | <b>--add-duplicate</b>] <b>lr-add</b> <u>router</u>
              Creates a new logical router named <u>router</u>, which initially has no ports.

              The  OVN  northbound  database  schema does not require logical router names to be unique, but the
              whole point to the names is to provide an easy way for humans to  refer  to  the  routers,  making
              duplicate  names  unhelpful.  Thus,  without  any  options, this command regards it as an error if
              <u>router</u> is a duplicate name. With <b>--may-exist</b>, adding a duplicate name succeeds but does not create
              a new logical router. With <b>--add-duplicate</b>, the command really creates a new logical router with a
              duplicate name. It is an error to specify both options. If there are multiple logical routers with
              a duplicate name, configure the logical routers using the UUID instead of the <u>router</u> name.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>lr-del</b> <u>router</u>
              Deletes <u>router</u>. It is an error if <u>router</u> does not exist, unless <b>--if-exists</b> is specified.

       <b>lr-list</b>
              Lists all existing routers on standard output, one per line.

              address/netmask for each <u>network</u>.

              The  optional  argument  <b>peer</b>  identifies  a  logical  router  port that connects to this one. The
              following example adds a router port with an IPv4 and IPv6 address with peer <b>lr1</b>:

              It is an error if a  logical  router  port  named  <u>port</u>  already  exists,  unless  <b>--may-exist</b>  is
              specified.  Regardless  of  <b>--may-exist</b>,  it  is  an  error if the existing router port is in some
              logical router other than <u>router</u>.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>lrp-del</b> <u>port</u>
              Deletes <u>port</u>. It is an error if <u>port</u> does not exist, unless <b>--if-exists</b> is specified.

       <b>lrp-list</b> <u>router</u>
              Lists all the logical router ports within <u>router</u> on standard output, one per line.

       <b>lrp-set-enabled</b> <u>port</u> <u>state</u>
              Set the administrative state of <u>port</u>, either <b>enabled</b> or <b>disabled</b>. When  a  port  is  disabled,  no
              traffic is allowed into or out of the port.

       <b>lrp-get-enabled</b> <u>port</u>

       <b>lrp-set-gateway-chassis</b> <u>port</u> <u>chassis</u> [<u>priority</u>]
              Set  gateway  chassis for <u>port</u>. <u>chassis</u> is the name of the chassis. This creates a gateway chassis
              entry in Gateway_Chassis table.  It  wonâ€™t  check  if  chassis  really  exists  in  OVN_Southbound
              database.  Priority will be set to 0 if <u>priority</u> is not provided by user. <u>priority</u> must be between
              <b>0</b> and <b>32767</b>, inclusive.

       <b>lrp-del-gateway-chassis</b> <u>port</u> <u>chassis</u>
              Deletes gateway chassis from <u>port</u>. It is an error if gateway chassis with <u>chassis</u>  for  <u>port</u>  does

   <b>Logical</b> <b>Router</b> <b>Static</b> <b>Route</b> <b>Commands</b>
       [<b>--may-exist</b>] [<b>--policy</b>=<u>POLICY</u>] [<b>--ecmp</b>] [<b>--ecmp-symmetric-reply</b>] [<b>--bfd[=</b><u>UUID</u>]] <b>lr-route-add</b> <u>router</u>
       <u>prefix</u> <u>nexthop</u> [<u>port</u>]
              Adds the specified route to <u>router</u>. <u>prefix</u> describes an IPv4 or IPv6 prefix for this  route,  such
              as  <b>192.168.100.0/24</b>.  <u>nexthop</u> specifies the gateway to use for this route, which should be the IP
              address of one of <u>router</u> logical router ports or the IP address of a  logical  port.  If  <u>port</u>  is
              specified,  packets  that  match  this route will be sent out that port. When <u>port</u> is omitted, OVN
              infers the output port based on <u>nexthop</u>. Nexthop can be set to <u>discard</u> for dropping packets  which
              match the given route.

              <b>--policy</b>  describes  the  policy used to make routing decisions. This should be one of "dst-ip" or
              "src-ip". If not specified, the default is "dst-ip".

              The <b>--ecmp</b> option allows for multiple routes with the same <u>prefix</u> <u>POLICY</u> but different <u>nexthop</u> and
              <u>port</u> to be added.

              The <b>--ecmp-symmetric-reply</b> option makes it so that traffic that arrives over an  ECMP  route  will
              have  its  reply  traffic  sent  out  over that same route. Setting <b>--ecmp-symmetric-reply</b> implies
              <b>--ecmp</b> so it is not necessary to set both.

              <b>--bfd</b> option is used to link a BFD session to the OVN route. If the BFD session UUID is  provided,
              it  will  be used for the OVN route otherwise the next-hop will be used to perform a lookup in the
              OVN BFD table. If the lookup fails and <u>port</u> is specified, a new entry in the  BFD  table  will  be
              created using the <u>nexthop</u> as <u>dst_ip</u> and <u>port</u> as <u>logical_port</u>.

              It  is  an  error if a route with <u>prefix</u> and <u>POLICY</u> already exists, unless <b>--may-exist</b>, <b>--ecmp</b>, or
              <b>--ecmp-symmetric-reply</b>  is  specified.  If  <b>--may-exist</b>   is   specified   but   not   <b>--ecmp</b>   or
              <b>--ecmp-symmetric-reply</b>, the existed route will be updated with the new nexthop and port. If <b>--ecmp</b>
              or  <b>--ecmp-symmetric-reply</b>  is  specified,  a  new  route will be added, regardless of the existed
              route., which is useful when adding ECMP routes, i.e. routes  with  same  <u>POLICY</u>  and  <u>prefix</u>  but
              different <u>nexthop</u> and <u>port</u>.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] [<b>--policy</b>=<u>POLICY</u>] <b>lr-route-del</b> <u>router</u> [<u>prefix</u> [<u>nexthop</u> [<u>port</u>]]]
              Deletes routes from <u>router</u>. If only <u>router</u> is supplied, all the routes from the logical router are
              deleted. If <u>POLICY</u>, <u>prefix</u>, <u>nexthop</u> and/or <u>port</u> are also specified, then all the routes that match
              the conditions will be deleted from the logical router.

              It is an error if there is no matching route entry, unless <b>--if-exists</b> is specified.

       <b>lr-route-list</b> <u>router</u>
              Lists the routes on <u>router</u>.

   <b>Logical</b> <b>Router</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Commands</b>

       <u>key=value]</u>]
              Add  Policy  to  <u>router</u>  which provides a way to configure permit/deny and reroute policies on the
              router. Permit/deny policies are similar to OVN ACLs, but exist  on  the  logical-router.  Reroute
              policies  are needed for service-insertion and service-chaining. <u>nexthop</u> is an optional parameter.
              It needs to be provided only when <u>action</u> is <u>reroute</u>. Multiple <b>nexthops</b> can be specified  for  ECMP
              routing.  A  policy  is  uniquely identified by <u>priority</u> and <u>match</u>. Multiple policies can have the
              same <u>priority</u>. <u>options</u> sets the router policy options as key-value pair. The supported option is :
              <b>pkt_mark</b>.

              If <b>--may-exist</b> is specified, adding a duplicated routing policy with the same priority  and  match
              string  is  not really created. Without <b>--may-exist</b>, adding a duplicated routing policy results in
              error.

              <b>--bfd</b> option is used to link a BFD session to the OVN reroute policy. OVN will look for an already
              running BFD session using next-hop as lookup key in the BFD table. If  the  lookup  fails,  a  new
              entry in the BFD table will be created using the <u>nexthop</u> as <u>dst_ip</u>.

              The following example shows a policy to lr1, which will drop packets from<b>192.168.100.0/24</b>.

              are deleted. If <u>priority</u> and/or <u>match</u> are also specified, then all  the  polices  that  match  the
              conditions will be deleted from the logical router.

              If <u>router</u> and <u>uuid</u> are supplied, then the policy with specified uuid is deleted. It is an error if
              <u>uuid</u> does not exist, unless <b>--if-exists</b> is specified.

       [<u>external_port_range</u>]
              Adds  the  specified  NAT  to  <u>router</u>.  The  <u>type</u> must be one of <b>snat</b>, <b>dnat</b>, or <b>dnat_and_snat</b>. The
              <u>external_ip</u> is an IPv4 address. The <u>logical_ip</u> is an IPv4 network (e.g 192.168.1.0/24) or an  IPv4
              address.  The  <u>logical_port</u> and <u>external_mac</u> are only accepted when <u>router</u> is a distributed router
              (rather than a gateway router) and <u>type</u> is <b>dnat_and_snat</b>. The  <u>logical_port</u>  is  the  name  of  an
              existing  logical  switch  port  where  the  <u>logical_ip</u>  resides.  The <u>external_mac</u> is an Ethernet
              address.

              When <b>--stateless</b> is specified then it implies that we will be  not  use  connection  tracker,  i.e
              internal  ip  and  external ip are 1:1 mapped. This implies that <b>--stateless</b> is applicable only to
              dnat_and_snat type NAT rules. An external ip with <b>--stateless</b> NAT cannot be shared with any  other
              NAT rule.

              <b>--gateway-port</b>  option allows specifying the distributed gateway port of <u>router</u> where the NAT rule
              needs to be applied. <u>GATEWAY_PORT</u> should reference a <b>Logical_Router_Port</b> row that is a distributed
              gateway port of <u>router</u>. When <u>router</u> has multiple distributed gateway ports and  the  gateway  port
              for  this  NAT  canâ€™t  be  inferred  from  the  <u>external_ip</u>,  it  is  an  error to not specify the
              <u>GATEWAY_PORT</u>.

              If the <b>--portrange</b>  option  is  specified,  then  a  range  of  ports  may  be  specified  in  the
              <b>external_port_range</b>  part  of  the <b>lr-nat-add</b> command. If this option is omitted, then an external
              port range may not be specified. The  format  of  the  port  range  is  <b>port_low-port_high</b>,  where
              <u>port_low</u> is a lower number than <u>port_high</u>. When the packet is NATted, a random port from the range
              will be selected as the source port. The range for the <b>external_port_range</b> is <b>1-65535</b>.

              The  <b>--match</b> allows to specify the extra match condition. The extra match is for more fine-grained
              control over the NAT rule.

              The <b>--priority</b> option allows to specify order of NAT rule evaluation. Priority must be  between  <b>0</b>
              and <b>32767</b>, inclusive and can be only specified together with <b>--match</b>.

              When  <u>type</u>  is  <b>dnat</b>,  the  externally visible IP address <u>external_ip</u> is DNATted to the IP address
              <u>logical_ip</u> in the logical space.

              When <u>type</u> is <b>snat</b>, IP packets with their source IP address that either matches the IP  address  in
              <u>logical_ip</u>  or  is  in  the  network  provided  by  <u>logical_ip</u>  is  SNATed  into the IP address in
              <u>external_ip</u>.

              When <u>type</u> is <b>dnat_and_snat</b>, the externally visible IP address <u>external_ip</u> is  DNATted  to  the  IP
              address  <u>logical_ip</u>  in the logical space. In addition, IP packets with the source IP address that
              matches <u>logical_ip</u> is SNATed into the IP address in <u>external_ip</u>.

              When the <u>logical_port</u> and <u>external_mac</u> are specified, the NAT  rule  will  be  programmed  on  the
              chassis  where  the  <u>logical_port</u>  resides.  This  includes ARP replies for the <u>external_ip</u>, which
              return the value of <u>external_mac</u>.  All  packets  transmitted  with  source  IP  address  equal  to
              <u>external_ip</u> will be sent using the <u>external_mac</u>.

              It  is  an  error  if  a  NAT  already  exists  with the same values of <u>router</u>, <u>type</u>, <u>external_ip</u>,
              <u>logical_ip</u> and <u>GATEWAY_PORT</u> (in case of multiple distributed gateway ports), unless <b>--may-exist</b> is
              specified. When <b>--may-exist</b>, <u>logical_port</u>, and <u>external_mac</u> are all specified, the existing values
              of <u>logical_port</u> and <u>external_mac</u> are overwritten.

       [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>lr-nat-del</b> <u>router</u> [<u>type</u> [<u>ip</u>] [<u>gateway_port</u>]]
              Deletes NATs from <u>router</u>. If only <u>router</u> is supplied, all the NATs from  the  logical  router  are
              deleted. If <u>type</u> is also specified, then all the NATs that match the <u>type</u> will be deleted from the
              logical  router.  If  <u>ip</u> is also specified without specifying <u>gateway_port</u>, then all the NATs that
              match the <u>type</u> and <u>ip</u> will be deleted from  the  logical  router.  If  <u>gateway_port</u>  is  specified
              without specifying <u>ip</u>, then all the NATs that match the <u>type</u> and <u>gateway_port</u> will be deleted from
              the  logical  router.  If  all  the  fields are given, then a single NAT rule that matches all the
              fields will be deleted. When <u>type</u> is <b>snat</b>, the <u>ip</u> should be  logical_ip.  When  <u>type</u>  is  <b>dnat</b>  or
              <b>dnat_and_snat</b>, the <u>ip</u> should be external_ip.

              It  is  an  error  if  both  <u>ip</u> and <u>gateway_port</u> are specified and there is no matching NAT entry,
              unless <b>--if-exists</b> is specified.

   <b>Load</b> <b>Balancer</b> <b>Commands</b>
       [<b>--may-exist</b> | <b>--add-duplicate</b> | <b>--reject</b> | <b>--event</b>] <b>lb-add</b> <u>lb</u> <u>vip</u> <u>ips</u> [<u>protocol</u>]
              Creates a new load balancer named <u>lb</u> with the provided <u>vip</u> and <u>ips</u> or adds the <u>vip</u> to an  existing
              <u>lb</u>. <u>vip</u> should be a virtual IP address (or an IP address and a port number with <b>:</b> as a separator).
              Examples  for <u>vip</u> are <b>192.168.1.4</b>, <b>fd0f::1</b>, and <b>192.168.1.5:8080</b>. <u>ips</u> should be comma separated IP
              endpoints (or comma separated IP addresses and port numbers with <b>:</b> as a separator).  <u>ips</u>  must  be
              the    same    address    family    as    <u>vip</u>.    Examples   for   <u>ips</u>   are   <b>10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2</b>or
              <b>[fdef::1]:8800,[fdef::2]:8800</b>.

              The optional argument <u>protocol</u> must be either <b>tcp</b>, <b>udp</b> or <b>sctp</b>. This argument  is  useful  when  a
              port  number  is  provided as part of the <u>vip</u>. If the <u>protocol</u> is unspecified and a port number is
              provided as part of the <u>vip</u>, OVN assumes the <u>protocol</u> to be <b>tcp</b>.

              It is an error if the <u>vip</u> already exists in the load balancer  named  <u>lb</u>,  unless  <b>--may-exist</b>  is
              specified.  With  <b>--add-duplicate</b>, the command really creates a new load balancer with a duplicate
              name.

              If the load balancer is created with <b>--reject</b> option and it has no active backends,  a  TCP  reset
              segment  (for tcp) or an ICMP port unreachable packet (for all other kind of traffic) will be sent
              whenever an incoming packet is received for this load-balancer. Please note using <b>--reject</b>  option
              will disable empty_lb SB controller event for this load balancer.

              If the load balancer is created with <b>--event</b> option and it has no active backends, whenever the lb
              receives  traffic,  the  event is reported in the Controller_Event table in the SB db. Please note
              <b>--event</b> option canâ€™t be specified with <b>--reject</b> one.

              The following example adds a load balancer.

              Creates a new mirror in the <b>Mirror</b> table with the name <b>m</b> with the below mandatory arguments.

              <u>type</u> specifies the mirror type - <b>gre</b> , <b>erspan</b> or <b>local</b>.

              <u>index</u> specifies the tunnel index value (which is an integer) if the <u>type</u> is <b>gre</b> or <b>erspan</b>.

              <u>filter</u> specifies the mirror source selection. Can be <b>from-lport</b>, <b>to-lport</b> or <b>both</b>.

              <u>dest</u>  specifies  the  mirror destination IP (v4 or v6) if the <u>type</u> is <b>gre</b> or <b>erspan</b>. For a <u>type</u> of
              <b>local</b>, this field defines a local interface on the OVS integration bridge to be used as the mirror
              destination. The interface must possess external-ids:mirror-id that matches this string.

       <b>mirror-del</b> <u>m</u>
              Deletes the mirror <b>m</b>.

       <b>mirror-list</b>
              Lists the mirrors.

   <b>Synchronization</b> <b>Commands</b>
       sync   Ordinarily, <b>--wait=sb</b> or <b>--wait=hv</b> only waits for changes by the current <b>ovn-nbctl</b>  invocation  to
              take  effect.  This means that, if none of the commands supplied to <b>ovn-nbctl</b> change the database,
              then the command does not wait at all. With the <b>sync</b> command, however, <b>ovn-nbctl</b>  waits  even  for
              earlier  changes  to  the  database to propagate down to the southbound database or all of the OVN
              chassis, according to the argument to <b>--wait</b>.

   <b>Remote</b> <b>Connectivity</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands manipulate the <b>connections</b> column in the <b>NB_Global</b> table and rows in the <b>Connection</b> table.
       When <b>ovsdb-server</b> is configured to use the <b>connections</b> column for  OVSDB  connections,  this  allows  the
       administrator to use <b>ovn-nbctl</b> to configure database connections.

              <b>get-connection</b>
                     Prints the configured connection(s).

              <b>del-connection</b>
                     Deletes the configured connection(s).

              [<b>--inactivity-probe=</b><u>msecs</u>] <b>set-connection</b> <u>target</u>...
                     Sets the configured manager target or targets. Use <b>--inactivity-probe=</b><u>msecs</u> to override the
                     default idle connection inactivity probe time. Use 0 to disable inactivity probes.

   <b>SSL/TLS</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>get-ssl</b>
              Prints the SSL/TLS configuration.

       <b>del-ssl</b>
              Deletes the current SSL/TLS configuration.

       [<b>--bootstrap</b>] <b>set-ssl</b> <u>private-key</u> <u>certificate</u> <u>ca-cert</u> [<u>ssl-protocol-list</u> [<u>ssl-cipher-list</u> [<u>ssl-</u>
       <u>ciphersuites</u>]]]
              Sets the SSL/TLS configuration.

   <b>Database</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These  commands query and modify the contents of <b>ovsdb</b> tables. They are a slight abstraction of the <b>ovsdb</b>
       interface and as such they operate at a lower level than other <b>ovn-nbctl</b> commands.

       <u>Identifying</u> <u>Tables,</u> <u>Records,</u> <u>and</u> <u>Columns</u>

       Each of these commands has a <u>table</u> parameter to identify a table within the database. Many of  them  also
       take  a  <u>record</u> parameter that identifies a particular record within a table. The <u>record</u> parameter may be
       the UUID for a record, which may be abbreviated to its first 4 (or more) hex digits, as long as  that  is
       unique.  Many tables offer additional ways to identify records. Some commands also take <u>column</u> parameters
       that identify a particular field within the records in a table.

       For a list of tables and their columns, see <b><a href="../man5/ovn-nb.5.html">ovn-nb</a></b>(5) or see the table listing from the <b>--help</b> option.

       Record names must be specified in full  and  with  correct  capitalization,  except  that  UUIDs  may  be
       abbreviated  to  their first 4 (or more) hex digits, as long as that is unique within the table. Names of
       tables and columns are not case-sensitive, and <b>-</b> and <b>_</b> are treated interchangeably. Unique  abbreviations
       of  table  and  column  names  are  acceptable, e.g. <b>d</b> or <b>dhcp</b> is sufficient to identify the <b>DHCP_Options</b>
       table.

       <u>Database</u> <u>Values</u>

       Each column in the database accepts a fixed type of data. The currently defined basic  types,  and  their
       representations, are:

              integer
                     A decimal integer in the range -2**63 to 2**63-1, inclusive.

              real   A floating-point number.

              Boolean
                     True or false, written <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>, respectively.

              string An  arbitrary  Unicode  string, except that null bytes are not allowed. Quotes are optional
                     for most strings that begin with an English  letter  or  underscore  and  consist  only  of
                     letters,  underscores, hyphens, and periods. However, <b>true</b> and <b>false</b> and strings that match
                     the syntax of UUIDs (see below) must be enclosed in double quotes to distinguish them  from
                     other basic types. When double quotes are used, the syntax is that of strings in JSON, e.g.
                     backslashes  may be used to escape special characters. The empty string must be represented
                     as a pair of double quotes (<b>""</b>).

              UUID   Either   a   universally   unique   identifier   in   the   style   of   RFC   4122,   e.g.
                     <b>f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6</b>, or an <b>@</b><u>name</u> defined by a <b>get</b> or <b>create</b> command within
                     the same <b>ovs-vsctl</b> invocation.

       Multiple values in a single column may be separated by spaces or a single comma. When multiple values are
       present,  duplicates  are  not allowed, and order is not important. Conversely, some database columns can
       have an empty set of values, represented as <b>[]</b>, and square brackets may  optionally  enclose  other  non-
       empty sets or single values as well.

       A  few  database columns are ``mapsâ€™â€™ of key-value pairs, where the key and the value are each some fixed
       database type. These are specified in the form <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>, where <u>key</u> and <u>value</u> follow the syntax  for  the
       columnâ€™s key type and value type, respectively. When multiple pairs are present (separated by spaces or a
       comma),  duplicate  keys  are  not  allowed,  and  again the order is not important. Duplicate values are
       allowed. An empty map is represented as <b>{}</b>. Curly braces may optionally enclose non-empty  maps  as  well
       (but  use  quotes  to  prevent  the  shell  from  expanding  <b>other-config={0=x,1=y}</b> into <b>other-config=0=x</b>

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] [<b>--columns=</b><u>column</u>[<b>,</b><u>column</u>]...] <b>list</b> <u>table</u> [<u>record</u>]...
                     Lists the data in each specified <u>record</u>. If no records are specified, lists all the records
                     in <u>table</u>.

                     If <b>--columns</b> is specified, only the requested columns are listed, in the  specified  order.
                     Otherwise, all columns are listed, in alphabetical order by column name.

                     Without  <b>--if-exists</b>,  it  is  an  error  if  any  specified  <u>record</u>  does  not exist. With
                     <b>--if-exists</b>, the command ignores any <u>record</u> that does  not  exist,  without  producing  any
                     output.

              [<b>--columns=</b><u>column</u>[<b>,</b><u>column</u>]...] <b>find</b> <u>table</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>]...
                     Lists  the  data in each record in <u>table</u> whose <u>column</u> equals <u>value</u> or, if <u>key</u> is specified,
                     whose <u>column</u> contains a <u>key</u> with the specified <u>value</u>. The following operators may  be  used
                     where <b>=</b> is written in the syntax summary:

                     <b>=</b> <b>!=</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>&lt;=</b> <b>&gt;=</b>
                            Selects  records  in  which  <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]  equals,  does not equal, is less than, is
                            greater than, is less than or equal to, or  is  greater  than  or  equal  to  <u>value</u>,
                            respectively.

                            Consider  <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]  and <u>value</u> as sets of elements. Identical sets are considered
                            equal. Otherwise, if the sets have different numbers of elements, then the set  with
                            more  elements  is  considered to be larger. Otherwise, consider a element from each
                            set pairwise, in increasing order within each  set.  The  first  pair  that  differs
                            determines  the  result.  (For a column that contains key-value pairs, first all the
                            keys are compared, and values are considered only if the two sets contain  identical
                            keys.)

                     <b>{=}</b> <b>{!=}</b>
                            Test for set equality or inequality, respectively.

                     <b>{&lt;=}</b>   Selects   records  in  which  <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]  is  a  subset  of  <u>value</u>.  For  example,
                            <b>flood-vlans{&lt;=}1,2</b> selects records in which the <b>flood-vlans</b> column is the empty  set
                            or contains 1 or 2 or both.

                     <b>{&lt;}</b>    Selects  records  in  which  <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]  is a proper subset of <u>value</u>. For example,
                            <b>flood-vlans{&lt;}1,2</b> selects records in which the <b>flood-vlans</b> column is the  empty  set
                            or contains 1 or 2 but not both.

                     <b>{&gt;=}</b> <b>{&gt;}</b>
                            Same  as  <b>{&lt;=}</b>  and <b>{&lt;}</b>, respectively, except that the relationship is reversed. For
                            example, <b>flood-vlans{&gt;=}1,2</b> selects records in which the <b>flood-vlans</b> column contains
                            both 1 and 2.

                     The following operators are available only in Open vSwitch 2.16 and later:

                     <b>{in}</b>   Selects records in which every element in <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>] is also in  <u>value</u>.  (This  is
                            the same as <b>{&lt;=}</b>.)

                     <b>{not-in}</b>
                            Selects records in which every element in <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>] is not in <u>value</u>.

                     For  arithmetic operators (<b>=</b> <b>!=</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>&lt;=</b> <b>&gt;=</b>), when <u>key</u> is specified but a particular recordâ€™s
                     <u>column</u> does not contain <u>key</u>, the record is always  omitted  from  the  results.  Thus,  the
                     condition  <b>other-config:mtu!=1500</b>  matches  records  that have a <b>mtu</b> key whose value is not
                     1500, but not those that lack an <b>mtu</b> key.

                     For the set operators, when <u>key</u> is specified but a  particular  recordâ€™s  <u>column</u>  does  not
                     contain   <u>key</u>,   the  comparison  is  done  against  an  empty  set.  Thus,  the  condition
                     <b>other-config:mtu{!=}1500</b> matches records that have a <b>mtu</b> key whose value is  not  1500  and
                     those that lack an <b>mtu</b> key.

                     Donâ€™t forget to escape <b>&lt;</b> or <b>&gt;</b> from interpretation by the shell.

                     If  <b>--columns</b>  is specified, only the requested columns are listed, in the specified order.
                     Otherwise all columns are listed, in alphabetical order by column name.

                     The UUIDs shown for rows created in the same <b>ovs-vsctl</b> invocation will be wrong.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] [<b>--id=@</b><u>name</u>] <b>get</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]]...
                     Prints the value of each specified <u>column</u> in the given <u>record</u> in <u>table</u>. For map columns,  a
                     <u>key</u>  may optionally be specified, in which case the value associated with <u>key</u> in the column
                     is printed, instead of the entire map.

                     Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <u>record</u> does not exist or <u>key</u> is  specified,  if  <u>key</u>
                     does not exist in <u>record</u>. With <b>--if-exists</b>, a missing <u>record</u> yields no output and a missing
                     <u>key</u> prints a blank line.

                     If  <b>@</b><u>name</u>  is  specified, then the UUID for <u>record</u> may be referred to by that name later in
                     the same <b>ovs-vsctl</b> invocation in contexts where a UUID is expected.

                     Both <b>--id</b> and the <u>column</u> arguments are optional, but usually at  least  one  or  the  other
                     should  be  specified.  If  both  are omitted, then <b>get</b> has no effect except to verify that
                     <u>record</u> exists in <u>table</u>.

                     <b>--id</b> and <b>--if-exists</b> cannot be used together.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>set</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>...
                     Sets the value of each specified <u>column</u> in the given <u>record</u> in  <u>table</u>  to  <u>value</u>.  For  map
                     columns,  a <u>key</u> may optionally be specified, in which case the value associated with <u>key</u> in
                     that column is changed (or added, if none exists), instead of the entire map.

                     Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if  <u>record</u>  does  not  exist.  With  <b>--if-exists</b>,  this
                     command does nothing if <u>record</u> does not exist.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>add</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> [<u>key</u><b>=</b>]<u>value</u>...
                     Adds  the  specified  value  or key-value pair to <u>column</u> in <u>record</u> in <u>table</u>. If <u>column</u> is a
                     map, then <u>key</u> is required, otherwise it is prohibited. If  <u>key</u>  already  exists  in  a  map
                     column,  then the current <u>value</u> is not replaced (use the <b>set</b> command to replace an existing
                     value).

                     Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if  <u>record</u>  does  not  exist.  With  <b>--if-exists</b>,  this
                     command does nothing if <u>record</u> does not exist.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> <u>value</u>...

                     [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> <u>key</u>...

                     [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>...  Removes the specified values or key-
                     value  pairs from <u>column</u> in <u>record</u> in <u>table</u>. The first form applies to columns that are not
                     maps: each specified <u>value</u> is removed from the column. The second and third forms apply  to
                     map  columns:  if  only  a  <u>key</u> is specified, then any key-value pair with the given <u>key</u> is
                     removed, regardless of its value; if a <u>value</u> is given then a pair is removed only  if  both
                     key and value match.

                     It is not an error if the column does not contain the specified key or value or pair.

                     Without  <b>--if-exists</b>,  it  is  an  error  if  <u>record</u> does not exist. With <b>--if-exists</b>, this
                     command does nothing if <u>record</u> does not exist.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>clear</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u>...
                     Sets each <u>column</u> in <u>record</u> in <u>table</u> to the empty set or empty  map,  as  appropriate.  This
                     command applies only to columns that are allowed to be empty.

                     Without  <b>--if-exists</b>,  it  is  an  error  if  <u>record</u> does not exist. With <b>--if-exists</b>, this
                     command does nothing if <u>record</u> does not exist.

              [<b>--id=(@</b><u>name</u>|<u>uuid</u>)] <b>create</b> <u>table</u> <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>...
                     Creates a new record in <u>table</u> and sets the initial  values  of  each  <u>column</u>.  Columns  not
                     explicitly set will receive their default values. Outputs the UUID of the new row.

                     If  <b>@</b><u>name</u>  is  specified,  then  the  UUID  for the new row may be referred to by that name
                     elsewhere in the same  <b>\*(PN</b>  invocation  in  contexts  where  a  UUID  is  expected.  Such
                     references may precede or follow the <b>create</b> command.

                     If a valid <u>uuid</u> is specified, then it is used as the UUID of the new row.

                     Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                            Records  in  the Open vSwitch database are significant only when they can be reached
                            directly or indirectly from the <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table. Except for records in the <b>QoS</b> or
                            <b>Queue</b> tables, records that  are  not  reachable  from  the  <b>Open_vSwitch</b>  table  are
                            automatically  deleted from the database. This deletion happens immediately, without
                            waiting for additional <b>ovs-vsctl</b> commands or other database activity. Thus, a <b>create</b>
                            command must generally  be  accompanied  by  additional  commands  <u>within</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>same</u>
                            <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  <u>invocation</u>  to add a chain of references to the newly created record from
                            the top-level <b>Open_vSwitch</b> record. The <b>EXAMPLES</b> section  gives  some  examples  that
                            show how to do this.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>destroy</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u>...
                     Deletes  each  specified  <u>record</u>  from <u>table</u>. Unless <b>--if-exists</b> is specified, each <u>record</u>s
                     must exist.

              <b>--all</b> <b>destroy</b> <u>table</u>
                     Deletes all records from the <u>table</u>.

                     Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                            The <b>destroy</b> command is only useful for records in the <b>QoS</b> or <b>Queue</b>  tables.  Records
                            in  other  tables  are  automatically  deleted  from  the  database when they become
                            unreachable from the <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table. This means that deleting the last reference
                            to a record is sufficient for deleting the  record  itself.  For  records  in  these
                            tables,  <b>destroy</b>  is  silently  ignored.  See  the  <b>EXAMPLES</b>  section below for more
                            information.

              <b>wait-until</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>]...
                     Waits until <u>table</u> contains a record named <u>record</u> whose <u>column</u> equals <u>value</u> or,  if  <u>key</u>  is
                     specified,  whose <u>column</u> contains a <u>key</u> with the specified <u>value</u>. This command supports the
                     same operators and semantics described for the <b>find</b> command above.

                     If no <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u> arguments are given, this command waits only until <u>record</u>  exists.
                     If more than one such argument is given, the command waits until all of them are satisfied.

                     Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                            Usually <b>wait-until</b> should be placed at the beginning of a set of <b>ovs-vsctl</b> commands.
                            For  example,  <b>wait-until</b>  <b>bridge</b>  <b>br0</b>  <b>--</b>  <b>get</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>datapath_id</b> waits until a
                            bridge named <b>br0</b> is created, then prints its <b>datapath_id</b> column, whereas <b>get</b>  <b>bridge</b>
                            <b>br0</b>  <b>datapath_id</b>  <b>--</b>  <b>wait-until</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>br0</b> will abort if no bridge named <b>br0</b> exists
                            when <b>ovs-vsctl</b> initially connects to the database.

                     Consider  specifying  <b>--timeout=0</b>  along  with  <b>--wait-until</b>,  to  prevent  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  from
                     terminating after waiting only at most 5 seconds.

              <b>comment</b> [<u>arg</u>]...
                     This  command has no effect on behavior, but any database log record created by the command
                     will include the command and its arguments.
