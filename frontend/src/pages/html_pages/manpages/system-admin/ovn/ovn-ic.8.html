       ovn-ic - Open Virtual Network interconnection controller

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ovn-ic</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ovn-ic</b>,  OVN  interconnection  controller,  is  a  centralized  daemon  which  communicates  with  global
       interconnection databases IC_NB/IC_SB to configure and exchange data with local NB/SB for interconnecting
       with other OVN deployments.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--ovnnb-db=</b><u>database</u>
              The OVSDB database containing the OVN Northbound Database. If the <b>OVN_NB_DB</b>  environment  variable
              is set, its value is used as the default. Otherwise, the default is <b>unix:/ovnnb_db.sock</b>.

       <b>--ovnsb-db=</b><u>database</u>
              The  OVSDB  database containing the OVN Southbound Database. If the <b>OVN_SB_DB</b> environment variable
              is set, its value is used as the default. Otherwise, the default is <b>unix:/ovnsb_db.sock</b>.

       <b>--ic-nb-db=</b><u>database</u>
              The OVSDB database containing the OVN Interconnection Northbound  Database.  If  the  <b>OVN_IC_NB_DB</b>
              environment  variable  is  set,  its  value  is  used  as  the  default. Otherwise, the default is
              <b>unix:/ovn_ic_nb_db.sock</b>.

       <b>--ic-sb-db=</b><u>database</u>
              The OVSDB database containing the OVN Interconnection Southbound  Database.  If  the  <b>OVN_IC_SB_DB</b>
              environment  variable  is  set,  its  value  is  used  as  the  default. Otherwise, the default is
              <b>unix:/ovn_ic_sb_db.sock</b>.

       <u>database</u> in the above options must be an OVSDB active or  passive  connection  method,  as  described  in
       <b><a href="../man7/ovsdb.7.html">ovsdb</a></b>(7).

   <b>Daemon</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--pidfile</b>[<b>=</b><u>pidfile</u>]
              Causes  a  file (by default, <u>program</u><b>.pid</b>) to be created indicating the PID of the running process.
              If the <u>pidfile</u> argument is not specified, or if it does not begin with <b>/</b>, then it is created in .

              If <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, no pidfile is created.

       <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b>
              By default, when <b>--pidfile</b> is specified and the specified pidfile already exists and is locked  by
              a running process, the daemon refuses to start. Specify <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b> to cause it to instead
              overwrite the pidfile.

              When <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, this option has no effect.

       <b>--detach</b>
              Runs  this  program  as  a background process. The process forks, and in the child it starts a new
              session, closes the standard file descriptors (which has the side effect of disabling  logging  to
              the  console),  and  changes  its  current directory to the root (unless <b>--no-chdir</b> is specified).
              After the child completes its initialization, the parent exits.

       <b>--monitor</b>
              Creates an additional process to monitor this program. If it dies due to a signal that indicates a
              programming error (<b>SIGABRT</b>,  <b>SIGALRM</b>,  <b>SIGBUS</b>,  <b>SIGFPE</b>,  <b>SIGILL</b>,  <b>SIGPIPE</b>,  <b>SIGSEGV</b>,  <b>SIGXCPU</b>,  or
              <b>SIGXFSZ</b>) then the monitor process starts a new copy of it. If the daemon dies or exits for another
              reason, the monitor process exits.

              This option is normally used with <b>--detach</b>, but it also functions without it.

       <b>--no-chdir</b>
              By  default,  when  <b>--detach</b> is specified, the daemon changes its current working directory to the
              root directory after it  detaches.  Otherwise,  invoking  the  daemon  from  a  carelessly  chosen
              directory  would  prevent  the  administrator  from  unmounting  the  file  system that holds that
              directory.

              Specifying <b>--no-chdir</b> suppresses this behavior, preventing the daemon from  changing  its  current
              working  directory.  This  may be useful for collecting core files, since it is common behavior to
              write core dumps into the current working directory and the root directory is not a good directory
              to use.

              This option has no effect when <b>--detach</b> is not specified.

       <b>--no-self-confinement</b>
              By default this daemon will try to  self-confine  itself  to  work  with  files  under  well-known
              directories  determined at build time. It is better to stick with this default behavior and not to
              use this flag unless some other Access Control is used to confine daemon. Note that in contrast to
              other access control implementations that are typically enforced from kernel-space  (e.g.  DAC  or
              MAC),  self-confinement  is  imposed  from  the  user-space  daemon itself and hence should not be
              considered as a full confinement strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional layer  of
              security.

       <b>--user=</b><u>user</u><b>:</b><u>group</u>
              Causes  this program to run as a different user specified in <u>user</u><b>:</b><u>group</u>, thus dropping most of the
              root privileges. Short forms <u>user</u> and <b>:</b><u>group</u> are also allowed, with current user or group assumed,
              respectively. Only daemons started by the root user accepts this argument.

              On Linux, daemons will be granted <b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b>  and  <b>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES</b>  before  dropping  root
              privileges.  Daemons  that  interact  with a datapath, such as <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>, will be granted three
              additional capabilities, namely <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>, <b>CAP_NET_BROADCAST</b> and <b>CAP_NET_RAW</b>.  The  capability
              change will apply even if the new user is root.

              On  Windows,  this option is not currently supported. For security reasons, specifying this option
              will cause the daemon process not to start.

   <b>Logging</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-v</b>[<u>spec</u>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<u>spec</u>]
            Sets logging levels. Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log level for every module and destination  to  <b>dbg</b>.
            Otherwise,  <u>spec</u>  is  a  list  of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from each
            category below:

            •      A valid module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b> command on <b><a href="../man8/ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl</a></b>(8), limits  the  log
                   level change to the specified module.

            •      <b>syslog</b>,  <b>console</b>,  or  <b>file</b>,  to limit the log level change to only to the system log, to the
                   console, or to a file, respectively.  (If  <b>--detach</b>  is  specified,  the  daemon  closes  its
                   standard file descriptors, so logging to the console will have no effect.)

                   On  Windows  platform,  <b>syslog</b>  is  accepted  as  a  word  and  is only useful along with the
                   <b>--syslog-target</b> option (the word has no effect otherwise).

            •      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to control the log level. Messages of the given  severity
                   or  higher  will  be logged, and messages of lower severity will be filtered out. <b>off</b> filters
                   out all messages. See <b><a href="../man8/ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl</a></b>(8) for a definition of each log level.

            Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

            Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>, logging to a file will not take place  unless  <b>--log-file</b>
            is also specified (see below).

            For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
            Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to <b>--verbose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
            Sets  the  log  pattern  for <u>destination</u> to <u>pattern</u>. Refer to <b><a href="../man8/ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl</a></b>(8) for a description of the
            valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
            Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. <u>facility</u> can be one of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>,
            <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>, <b>news</b>, <b>uucp</b>, <b>clock</b>, <b>ftp</b>, <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>,  <b>clock2</b>,  <b>local0</b>,  <b>local1</b>,  <b>local2</b>,  <b>local3</b>,
            <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b> or <b>local7</b>. If this option is not specified, <b>daemon</b> is used as the default for
            the  local  system  syslog and <b>local0</b> is used while sending a message to the target provided via the
            <b>--syslog-target</b> option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
            Enables logging to a file. If <u>file</u> is specified, then it is used as the exact name for the log file.
            The default log file name used if <u>file</u> is omitted is <b>/var/log/ovn/</b><u>program</u><b>.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><u>host</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>
            Send syslog messages to UDP <u>port</u> on <u>host</u>, in addition to the system  syslog.  The  <u>host</u>  must  be  a
            numerical IP address, not a hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><u>method</u>
            Specify  <u>method</u>  as  how  syslog  messages  should be sent to syslog daemon. The following forms are
            supported:

            •      <b>libc</b>, to use the libc <b>syslog()</b> function. Downside of using this options  is  that  libc  adds
                   fixed  prefix  to every message before it is actually sent to the syslog daemon over <b>/dev/log</b>
                   UNIX domain socket.

            •      <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>, to use a UNIX domain socket directly. It is possible to specify arbitrary  message
                   format  with  this  option.  However,  <b>rsyslogd</b>  <b>8.9</b> and older versions use hard coded parser
                   function anyway that limits UNIX domain socket use. If you  want  to  use  arbitrary  message
                   format with older <b>rsyslogd</b> versions, then use UDP socket to localhost IP address instead.

            •      <b>udp:</b><u>ip</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>,  to  use  a UDP socket. With this method it is possible to use arbitrary message
                   format also with  older  <b>rsyslogd</b>.  When  sending  syslog  messages  over  UDP  socket  extra
                   precaution  needs to be taken into account, for example, syslog daemon needs to be configured
                   to listen on the specified UDP port, accidental iptables  rules  could  be  interfering  with
                   local  syslog  traffic  and there are some security considerations that apply to UDP sockets,
                   but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

            •      <b>null</b>, to discard all messages logged to syslog.

            The default is taken from the <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b> environment variable; if it is unset, the default is
            <b>libc</b>.

   <b>PKI</b> <b>Options</b>
       PKI configuration is required in order  to  use  SSL/TLS  for  the  connections  to  the  Northbound  and
       Southbound databases.

              <b>-p</b> <u>privkey.pem</u>
              <b>--private-key=</b><u>privkey.pem</u>
                   Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used as identity for outgoing SSL/TLS
                   connections.

              <b>-c</b> <u>cert.pem</u>
              <b>--certificate=</b><u>cert.pem</u>
                   Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the private key specified on  <b>-p</b>
                   or  <b>--private-key</b>  to  be  trustworthy.  The  certificate  must  be signed by the certificate
                   authority (CA) that the peer in SSL/TLS connections will use to verify it.

              <b>-C</b> <u>cacert.pem</u>
              <b>--ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
                   Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate for verifying  certificates  presented  to
                   this  program  by  SSL/TLS peers. (This may be the same certificate that SSL/TLS peers use to
                   verify the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or <b>--certificate</b>,  or  it  may  be  a  different  one,
                   depending on the PKI design in use.)

              <b>-C</b> <b>none</b>
              <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
                   Disables  verification of certificates presented by SSL/TLS peers. This introduces a security
                   risk, because it means that certificates cannot be verified to  be  those  of  known  trusted
                   hosts.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--unixctl=</b><u>socket</u>
              Sets  the name of the control socket on which <u>program</u> listens for runtime management commands (see
              <u>RUNTIME</u> <u>MANAGEMENT</u> <u>COMMANDS,</u> below). If <u>socket</u> does  not  begin  with  <b>/</b>,  it  is  interpreted  as
              relative  to  . If <b>--unixctl</b> is not used at all, the default socket is <b>/</b><u>program</u><b>.</b><u>pid</u><b>.ctl</b>, where <u>pid</u>
              is <u>program</u>’s process ID.

              On Windows a local named pipe is used to listen for runtime management commands. A file is created
              in the absolute path as pointed by <u>socket</u> or if <b>--unixctl</b> is not used at all, a file is created as
              <u>program</u> in the configured <u>OVS_RUNDIR</u> directory. The file exists just to mimic the  behavior  of  a
              Unix domain socket.

              Specifying <b>none</b> for <u>socket</u> disables the control socket feature.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b>
            Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
            Prints version information to the console.

</pre><h4><b>RUNTIME</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ovs-appctl</b>  can send commands to a running <b>ovn-ic</b> process. The currently supported commands are described
       below.

              <b>exit</b>   Causes <b>ovn-ic</b> to gracefully terminate.

              <b>pause</b>  Pauses the ovn-ic operation from processing any database changes. This will  also  instruct
                     ovn-ic to drop any lock on SB DB.

              <b>resume</b> Resumes  the  ovn-ic  operation  to process database contents. This will also instruct ovn-
                     northd to aspire for the lock on SB DB.

              <b>is-paused</b>
                     Returns "true" if ovn-ic is currently paused, "false" otherwise.

              <b>status</b> Prints this server’s status. Status will be "active" if ovn-ic has acquired OVSDB  lock  on
                     SB DB, "standby" if it has not or "paused" if this instance is paused.

</pre><h4><b>ACTIVE-STANDBY</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>HIGH</b> <b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       You  may  run  <b>ovn-ic</b> more than once in an OVN deployment. When connected to a standalone or clustered DB
       setup, OVN will automatically ensure that only one of them is active at a time. If multiple instances  of
       <b>ovn-ic</b>  are  running  and  the  active  <b>ovn-ic</b>  fails,  one  of  the hot standby instances of <b>ovn-ic</b> will
       automatically take over.

OVN 25.03.0                                          ovn-ic                                            <u><a href="../man8/ovn-ic.8.html">ovn-ic</a></u>(8)
