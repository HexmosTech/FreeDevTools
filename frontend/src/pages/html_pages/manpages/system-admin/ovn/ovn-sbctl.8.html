</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ovn-sbctl - Open Virtual Network southbound db management utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ovn-sbctl</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u> [<u>arg</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ovn-sbctl</b>  program configures the <b>OVN_Southbound</b> database by providing a high-level interface to its
       configuration database. See <b><a href="../man5/ovn-sb.5.html">ovn-sb</a></b>(5) for comprehensive documentation of the database schema.

       <b>ovn-sbctl</b> connects to an <b>ovsdb-server</b> process that maintains an  OVN_Southbound  configuration  database.
       Using this connection, it queries and possibly applies changes to the database, depending on the supplied
       commands.

       <b>ovn-sbctl</b>  can perform any number of commands in a single run, implemented as a single atomic transaction
       against the database.

       The <b>ovn-sbctl</b> command line begins with global options (see <b>OPTIONS</b> below for details). The global options
       are followed by one or more commands. Each command should begin with  <b>--</b>  by  itself  as  a  command-line
       argument,  to separate it from the following commands. (The <b>--</b> before the first command is optional.) The
       command itself starts with command-specific options, if  any,  followed  by  the  command  name  and  any
       arguments.

</pre><h4><b>DAEMON</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       When  it  is  invoked  in  the  most  ordinary  way, <b>ovn-sbctl</b> connects to an OVSDB server that hosts the
       southbound database, retrieves a partial copy of the database that is complete enough  to  do  its  work,
       sends  a  transaction  request  to  the  server, and receives and processes the server’s reply. In common
       interactive use, this is fine, but if the database is large, the step  in  which  <b>ovn-sbctl</b>  retrieves  a
       partial copy of the database can take a long time, which yields poor performance overall.

       To  improve  performance in such a case, <b>ovn-sbctl</b> offers a "daemon mode," in which the user first starts
       <b>ovn-sbctl</b> running in the background and afterward uses the daemon to  execute  operations.  Over  several
       <b>ovn-sbctl</b>  command  invocations, this performs better overall because it retrieves a copy of the database
       only once at the beginning, not once per program run.

       Use the <b>--detach</b> option to start an <b>ovn-sbctl</b> daemon. With this option, <b>ovn-sbctl</b> prints the  name  of  a
       control  socket  to stdout. The client should save this name in environment variable <b>OVN_SB_DAEMON</b>. Under
       the Bourne shell this might be done like this:

             export OVN_SB_DAEMON=$(ovn-sbctl --pidfile --detach)

       When <b>OVN_SB_DAEMON</b> is set, <b>ovn-sbctl</b> automatically and transparently  uses  the  daemon  to  execute  its
       commands.

       When the daemon is no longer needed, kill it and unset the environment variable, e.g.:

             kill $(cat $OVN_RUNDIR/ovn-sbctl.pid)
             unset OVN_SB_DAEMON

       When using daemon mode, an alternative to the <b>OVN_SB_DAEMON</b> environment variable is to specify a path for
       the  Unix  socket.  When  starting  the  ovn-sbctl  daemon, specify the <b>-u</b> option with a full path to the
       location of the socket file. Here is an exmple:

             ovn-sbctl --detach -u /tmp/mysock.ctl

       Then to connect to the running daemon, use the <b>-u</b> option with the full path to the  socket  created  when
       the daemon was started:

             ovn-sbctl -u /tmp/mysock.ctl show

     <u>Daemon</u> <u>Commands</u>

       Daemon  mode  is  internally  implemented  using  the same mechanism used by <b>ovn-appctl</b>. One may also use
       <b>ovn-appctl</b> directly with the following commands:

              <b>run</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u> [<u>arg</u>...] [<b>--</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u> [<u>arg</u>...] ...]
                     Instructs the daemon process to run one or more  <b>ovn-sbctl</b>  commands  described  above  and
                     reply  with  the  results  of  running  these  commands.  Accepts the <b>--timeout</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>,
                     <b>--oneline</b>, and the options described under <b>Table</b> <b>Formatting</b> <b>Options</b> in addition to the  the
                     command-specific options.

              <b>exit</b>   Causes <b>ovn-sbctl</b> to gracefully terminate.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  options  listed  below  affect  the  behavior of <b>ovn-sbctl</b> as a whole. Some individual commands also
       accept their own options, which are given just before the command name.  If  the  first  command  on  the
       command line has options, then those options must be separated from the global options by <b>--</b>.

       <b>ovn-sbctl</b>  also accepts options from the <b>OVN_SBCTL_OPTIONS</b> environment variable, in the same format as on
       the command line. Options from the command line override those in the environment.

              <b>--db</b> <u>database</u>
                     The OVSDB database remote to contact. If the <b>OVN_SB_DB</b> environment  variable  is  set,  its
                     value  is  used  as  the  default.  Otherwise, the default is <b>unix:/ovnsb_db.sock</b>, but this
                     default is unlikely to be useful outside of single-machine OVN test environments.

              <b>--leader-only</b>
              <b>--no-leader-only</b>
                   By default, or with  <b>--leader-only</b>,  when  the  database  server  is  a  clustered  database,
                   <b>ovn-sbctl</b>  will  avoid servers other than the cluster leader. This ensures that any data that
                   <b>ovn-sbctl</b> reads and reports is up-to-date. With  <b>--no-leader-only</b>,  <b>ovn-sbctl</b>  will  use  any
                   server  in  the cluster, which means that for read-only transactions it can report and act on
                   stale  data  (transactions  that  modify  the  database  are  always  serialized  even   with
                   <b>--no-leader-only</b>).   Refer   to  <b>Understanding</b>  <b>Cluster</b>  <b>Consistency</b>  in  <b><a href="../man7/ovsdb.7.html">ovsdb</a></b>(7)  for  more
                   information.

              <b>--shuffle-remotes</b>
              <b>--no-shuffle-remotes</b>
                   By default, or with <b>--shuffle-remotes</b>, when there are multiple remotes specified in the OVSDB
                   connection string specified by <b>--db</b> or the <b>OVN_SB_DB</b> environment variable, the order  of  the
                   remotes  will  be  shuffled  before the client tries to connect. The remotes will be shuffled
                   only once to a new order before the first connection attempt. The following retries, if  any,
                   will  follow  the same new order. The default behavior is to make sure clients of a clustered
                   database can distribute evenly to all members  of  the  cluster.  With  <b>--no-shuffle-remotes</b>,
                   <b>ovn-sbctl</b>  will  use  the  original order specified in the connection string to connect. This
                   allows user to specify the preferred order, which is particularly useful for testing.

              <b>--no-syslog</b>
                   By default, <b>ovn-sbctl</b> logs its arguments and the details of any changes that it makes to  the
                   system log. This option disables this logging.

                   This option is equivalent to <b>--verbose=sbctl:syslog:warn</b>.

              <b>--oneline</b>
                   Modifies  the  output format so that the output for each command is printed on a single line.
                   New-line characters that would otherwise separate lines are printed  as  \fB\\n\fR,  and  any
                   instances  of  \fB\\\fR that would otherwise appear in the output are doubled. Prints a blank
                   line for each command that has no output. This option  does  not  affect  the  formatting  of
                   output from the <b>list</b> or <b>find</b> commands; see <b>Table</b> <b>Formatting</b> <b>Options</b> below.

              <b>--dry-run</b>
                   Prevents <b>ovn-sbctl</b> from actually modifying the database.

              <b>-t</b> <u>secs</u>
              <b>--timeout=</b><u>secs</u>
                   By  default,  or  with a <u>secs</u> of <b>0</b>, <b>ovn-sbctl</b> waits forever for a response from the database.
                   This option limits runtime to approximately <u>secs</u> seconds. If the timeout  expires,  <b>ovn-sbctl</b>
                   will exit with a <b>SIGALRM</b> signal. (A timeout would normally happen only if the database cannot
                   be contacted, or if the system is overloaded.)

   <b>Daemon</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--pidfile</b>[<b>=</b><u>pidfile</u>]
              Causes  a  file (by default, <u>program</u><b>.pid</b>) to be created indicating the PID of the running process.
              If the <u>pidfile</u> argument is not specified, or if it does not begin with <b>/</b>, then it is created in .

              If <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, no pidfile is created.

       <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b>
              By default, when <b>--pidfile</b> is specified and the specified pidfile already exists and is locked  by
              a running process, the daemon refuses to start. Specify <b>--overwrite-pidfile</b> to cause it to instead
              overwrite the pidfile.

              When <b>--pidfile</b> is not specified, this option has no effect.

       <b>--detach</b>
              Runs  this  program  as  a background process. The process forks, and in the child it starts a new
              session, closes the standard file descriptors (which has the side effect of disabling  logging  to
              the  console),  and  changes  its  current directory to the root (unless <b>--no-chdir</b> is specified).
              After the child completes its initialization, the parent exits.

       <b>--monitor</b>
              Creates an additional process to monitor this program. If it dies due to a signal that indicates a
              programming error (<b>SIGABRT</b>,  <b>SIGALRM</b>,  <b>SIGBUS</b>,  <b>SIGFPE</b>,  <b>SIGILL</b>,  <b>SIGPIPE</b>,  <b>SIGSEGV</b>,  <b>SIGXCPU</b>,  or
              <b>SIGXFSZ</b>) then the monitor process starts a new copy of it. If the daemon dies or exits for another
              reason, the monitor process exits.

              This option is normally used with <b>--detach</b>, but it also functions without it.

       <b>--no-chdir</b>
              By  default,  when  <b>--detach</b> is specified, the daemon changes its current working directory to the
              root directory after it  detaches.  Otherwise,  invoking  the  daemon  from  a  carelessly  chosen
              directory  would  prevent  the  administrator  from  unmounting  the  file  system that holds that
              directory.

              Specifying <b>--no-chdir</b> suppresses this behavior, preventing the daemon from  changing  its  current
              working  directory.  This  may be useful for collecting core files, since it is common behavior to
              write core dumps into the current working directory and the root directory is not a good directory
              to use.

              This option has no effect when <b>--detach</b> is not specified.

       <b>--no-self-confinement</b>
              By default this daemon will try to  self-confine  itself  to  work  with  files  under  well-known
              directories  determined at build time. It is better to stick with this default behavior and not to
              use this flag unless some other Access Control is used to confine daemon. Note that in contrast to
              other access control implementations that are typically enforced from kernel-space  (e.g.  DAC  or
              MAC),  self-confinement  is  imposed  from  the  user-space  daemon itself and hence should not be
              considered as a full confinement strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional layer  of
              security.

       <b>--user=</b><u>user</u><b>:</b><u>group</u>
              Causes  this program to run as a different user specified in <u>user</u><b>:</b><u>group</u>, thus dropping most of the
              root privileges. Short forms <u>user</u> and <b>:</b><u>group</u> are also allowed, with current user or group assumed,
              respectively. Only daemons started by the root user accepts this argument.

              On Linux, daemons will be granted <b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b>  and  <b>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES</b>  before  dropping  root
              privileges.  Daemons  that  interact  with a datapath, such as <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>, will be granted three
              additional capabilities, namely <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>, <b>CAP_NET_BROADCAST</b> and <b>CAP_NET_RAW</b>.  The  capability
              change will apply even if the new user is root.

              On  Windows,  this option is not currently supported. For security reasons, specifying this option
              will cause the daemon process not to start.

   <b>Logging</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-v</b>[<u>spec</u>]
       <b>--verbose=</b>[<u>spec</u>]
            Sets logging levels. Without any <u>spec</u>, sets the log level for every module and destination  to  <b>dbg</b>.
            Otherwise,  <u>spec</u>  is  a  list  of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from each
            category below:

            •      A valid module name, as displayed by the <b>vlog/list</b> command on <b><a href="../man8/ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl</a></b>(8), limits  the  log
                   level change to the specified module.

            •      <b>syslog</b>,  <b>console</b>,  or  <b>file</b>,  to limit the log level change to only to the system log, to the
                   console, or to a file, respectively.  (If  <b>--detach</b>  is  specified,  the  daemon  closes  its
                   standard file descriptors, so logging to the console will have no effect.)

                   On  Windows  platform,  <b>syslog</b>  is  accepted  as  a  word  and  is only useful along with the
                   <b>--syslog-target</b> option (the word has no effect otherwise).

            •      <b>off</b>, <b>emer</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, or <b>dbg</b>, to control the log level. Messages of the given  severity
                   or  higher  will  be logged, and messages of lower severity will be filtered out. <b>off</b> filters
                   out all messages. See <b><a href="../man8/ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl</a></b>(8) for a definition of each log level.

            Case is not significant within <u>spec</u>.

            Regardless of the log levels set for <b>file</b>, logging to a file will not take place  unless  <b>--log-file</b>
            is also specified (see below).

            For compatibility with older versions of OVS, <b>any</b> is accepted as a word but has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
            Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to <b>--verbose=dbg</b>.

       <b>-vPATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
       <b>--verbose=PATTERN:</b><u>destination</u><b>:</b><u>pattern</u>
            Sets  the  log  pattern  for <u>destination</u> to <u>pattern</u>. Refer to <b><a href="../man8/ovs-appctl.8.html">ovs-appctl</a></b>(8) for a description of the
            valid syntax for <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>-vFACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
       <b>--verbose=FACILITY:</b><u>facility</u>
            Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. <u>facility</u> can be one of <b>kern</b>, <b>user</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>,
            <b>syslog</b>, <b>lpr</b>, <b>news</b>, <b>uucp</b>, <b>clock</b>, <b>ftp</b>, <b>ntp</b>, <b>audit</b>, <b>alert</b>,  <b>clock2</b>,  <b>local0</b>,  <b>local1</b>,  <b>local2</b>,  <b>local3</b>,
            <b>local4</b>, <b>local5</b>, <b>local6</b> or <b>local7</b>. If this option is not specified, <b>daemon</b> is used as the default for
            the  local  system  syslog and <b>local0</b> is used while sending a message to the target provided via the
            <b>--syslog-target</b> option.

       <b>--log-file</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
            Enables logging to a file. If <u>file</u> is specified, then it is used as the exact name for the log file.
            The default log file name used if <u>file</u> is omitted is <b>/var/log/ovn/</b><u>program</u><b>.log</b>.

       <b>--syslog-target=</b><u>host</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>
            Send syslog messages to UDP <u>port</u> on <u>host</u>, in addition to the system  syslog.  The  <u>host</u>  must  be  a
            numerical IP address, not a hostname.

       <b>--syslog-method=</b><u>method</u>
            Specify  <u>method</u>  as  how  syslog  messages  should be sent to syslog daemon. The following forms are
            supported:

            •      <b>libc</b>, to use the libc <b>syslog()</b> function. Downside of using this options  is  that  libc  adds
                   fixed  prefix  to every message before it is actually sent to the syslog daemon over <b>/dev/log</b>
                   UNIX domain socket.

            •      <b>unix:</b><u>file</u>, to use a UNIX domain socket directly. It is possible to specify arbitrary  message
                   format  with  this  option.  However,  <b>rsyslogd</b>  <b>8.9</b> and older versions use hard coded parser
                   function anyway that limits UNIX domain socket use. If you  want  to  use  arbitrary  message
                   format with older <b>rsyslogd</b> versions, then use UDP socket to localhost IP address instead.

            •      <b>udp:</b><u>ip</u><b>:</b><u>port</u>,  to  use  a UDP socket. With this method it is possible to use arbitrary message
                   format also with  older  <b>rsyslogd</b>.  When  sending  syslog  messages  over  UDP  socket  extra
                   precaution  needs to be taken into account, for example, syslog daemon needs to be configured
                   to listen on the specified UDP port, accidental iptables  rules  could  be  interfering  with
                   local  syslog  traffic  and there are some security considerations that apply to UDP sockets,
                   but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.

            •      <b>null</b>, to discard all messages logged to syslog.

            The default is taken from the <b>OVS_SYSLOG_METHOD</b> environment variable; if it is unset, the default is
            <b>libc</b>.

   <b>Table</b> <b>Formatting</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options control the format of output from the <b>list</b> and <b>find</b> commands.

              <b>-f</b> <u>format</u>
              <b>--format=</b><u>format</u>
                   Sets the type of table formatting. The following types of <u>format</u> are available:

                   <b>table</b>  2-D text tables with aligned columns.

                   <b>list</b> (default)
                          A list with one column per line and rows separated by a blank line.

                   <b>html</b>   HTML tables.

                   <b>csv</b>    Comma-separated values as defined in RFC 4180.

                   <b>json</b>   JSON format as defined in RFC 4627. The output is a sequence of JSON objects, each  of
                          which  corresponds  to  one table. Each JSON object has the following members with the
                          noted values:

                          <b>caption</b>
                                 The table’s caption. This member is omitted if the table has no caption.

                          <b>headings</b>
                                 An array with one element per table column. Each  array  element  is  a  string
                                 giving the corresponding column’s heading.

                          <b>data</b>   An array with one element per table row. Each element is also an array with one
                                 element per table column. The elements of this second-level array are the cells
                                 that  constitute  the  table. Cells that represent OVSDB data or data types are
                                 expressed in the format described in the OVSDB specification; other  cells  are
                                 simply expressed as text strings.

              <b>-d</b> <u>format</u>
              <b>--data=</b><u>format</u>
                   Sets the formatting for cells within output tables unless the table format is set to <b>json</b>, in
                   which  case  <b>json</b>  formatting  is  always  used when formatting cells. The following types of
                   <u>format</u> are available:

                   <b>string</b> (default)
                          The simple format described in the <b>Database</b> <b>Values</b> section of <b><a href="../man8/ovs-vsctl.8.html">ovs-vsctl</a></b>(8).

                   <b>bare</b>   The simple format with punctuation stripped off: <b>[]</b> and <b>{}</b> are  omitted  around  sets,
                          maps,  and  empty columns, items within sets and maps are space-separated, and strings
                          are never quoted. This format may be easier for scripts to parse.

                   <b>json</b>   The RFC 4627 JSON format as described above.

              <b>--no-headings</b>
                   This option suppresses the heading row that otherwise appears  in  the  first  row  of  table
                   output.

              <b>--pretty</b>
                   By  default,  JSON  in output is printed as compactly as possible. This option causes JSON in
                   output to be printed in a more readable fashion. Members of objects and  elements  of  arrays
                   are printed one per line, with indentation.

                   This option does not affect JSON in tables, which is always printed compactly.

              <b>--bare</b>
                   Equivalent to <b>--format=list</b> <b>--data=bare</b> <b>--no-headings</b>.

   <b>PKI</b> <b>Options</b>
       PKI configuration is required to use SSL/TLS for the connection to the database.

              <b>-p</b> <u>privkey.pem</u>
              <b>--private-key=</b><u>privkey.pem</u>
                   Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used as identity for outgoing SSL/TLS
                   connections.

              <b>-c</b> <u>cert.pem</u>
              <b>--certificate=</b><u>cert.pem</u>
                   Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the private key specified on  <b>-p</b>
                   or  <b>--private-key</b>  to  be  trustworthy.  The  certificate  must  be signed by the certificate
                   authority (CA) that the peer in SSL/TLS connections will use to verify it.

              <b>-C</b> <u>cacert.pem</u>
              <b>--ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
                   Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate for verifying  certificates  presented  to
                   this  program  by  SSL/TLS peers. (This may be the same certificate that SSL/TLS peers use to
                   verify the certificate specified on <b>-c</b> or <b>--certificate</b>,  or  it  may  be  a  different  one,
                   depending on the PKI design in use.)

              <b>-C</b> <b>none</b>
              <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
                   Disables  verification of certificates presented by SSL/TLS peers. This introduces a security
                   risk, because it means that certificates cannot be verified to  be  those  of  known  trusted
                   hosts.

              <b>--bootstrap-ca-cert=</b><u>cacert.pem</u>
                     When  <u>cacert.pem</u> exists, this option has the same effect as <b>-C</b> or <b>--ca-cert</b>. If it does not
                     exist, then the executable will attempt to obtain the CA certificate from the SSL/TLS  peer
                     on  its first SSL/TLS connection and save it to the named PEM file. If it is successful, it
                     will immediately  drop  the  connection  and  reconnect,  and  from  then  on  all  SSL/TLS
                     connections  must  be  authenticated  by  a  certificate  signed by the CA certificate thus
                     obtained.

                     This option exposes the SSL/TLS connection to  a  man-in-the-middle  attack  obtaining  the
                     initial CA certificate, but it may be useful for bootstrapping.

                     This  option  is  only  useful  if the SSL/TLS peer sends its CA certificate as part of the
                     SSL/TLS certificate chain. SSL/TLS protocols do not require  the  server  to  send  the  CA
                     certificate.

                     This option is mutually exclusive with <b>-C</b> and <b>--ca-cert</b>.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b>
            Prints a brief help message to the console.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
            Prints version information to the console.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following sections describe the commands that <b>ovn-sbctl</b> supports.

   <b>OVN_Southbound</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands work with an <b>OVN_Southbound</b> database as a whole.

              <b>init</b>   Initializes  the  database,  if  it is empty. If the database has already been initialized,
                     this command has no effect.

              <b>show</b>   Prints a brief overview of the database contents.

   <b>Chassis</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands manipulate <b>OVN_Southbound</b> chassis.

              [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>chassis-add</b> <u>chassis</u> <u>encap-type</u> <u>encap-ip</u>
                     Creates a new chassis named <u>chassis</u>. <u>encap-type</u> is a comma-separated list of tunnel  types.
                     The  chassis  will have one encap entry for each specified tunnel type with <u>encap-ip</u> as the
                     destination IP for each.

                     Without <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting  to  create  a  chassis  that  exists  is  an  error.  With
                     <b>--may-exist</b>, this command does nothing if <u>chassis</u> already exists.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <u>chassis-del</u> <u>chassis</u>
                     Deletes <u>chassis</u> and its <u>encaps</u> and <u>gateway_ports</u>.

                     Without  <b>--if-exists</b>,  attempting to delete a chassis that does not exist is an error. With
                     <b>--if-exists</b> attempting to delete a chassis that does not exist has no effect.

   <b>Port</b> <b>Binding</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands manipulate <b>OVN_Southbound</b> port bindings.

              [<b>--may-exist</b>] <b>lsp-bind</b> <u>logical-port</u> <u>chassis</u>
                     Binds the logical port named <u>logical-port</u> to <u>chassis</u>.

                     Without <b>--may-exist</b>, attempting to bind a logical port that has already been  bound  is  an
                     error.  With  <b>--may-exist</b>, this command does nothing if <u>logical-port</u> has already been bound
                     to a chassis.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>lsp-unbind</b> <u>logical-port</u>
                     Removes the binding of <u>logical-port</u>.

                     Without <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to unbind a logical port that is not  bound  is  an  error.
                     With <b>--if-exists</b>, attempting to unbind logical port that is not bound has no effect.

   <b>Logical</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Commands</b>
       [<b>--uuid</b>] [<b>--ovs</b>[<b>=</b><u>remote</u><b>]</b>] [<b>--stats</b>] [<b>--vflows</b>] <b>lflow-list</b> [<u>logical-datapath</u>] [<u>lflow</u>...]
              List  logical  flows. If <u>logical-datapath</u> is specified, only list flows for that logical datapath.
              The <u>logical-datapath</u> may be given as a UUID or as a datapath name (reporting an error if  multiple
              datapaths have the same name).

              If at least one <u>lflow</u> is given, only matching logical flows, if any, are listed. Each <u>lflow</u> may be
              specified  as  a  UUID  or the first few characters of a UUID, optionally prefixed by <b>0x</b>. (Because
              <b>ovn-controller</b> sets OpenFlow flow cookies to the first 32 bits of the corresponding logical flow’s
              UUID, this makes it easy to look up the logical flow that generated a particular OpenFlow flow.)

              If <b>--uuid</b> is specified, the output includes the first 32 bits of each logical  flow’s  UUID.  This
              makes it easier to find the OpenFlow flows that correspond to a given logical flow.

              If  <b>--ovs</b> is included, <b>ovn-sbctl</b> attempts to obtain and display the OpenFlow flows that correspond
              to each OVN logical flow. To do so, <b>ovn-sbctl</b> connects to <u>remote</u> (by  default,  <b>unix:/br-int.mgmt</b>)
              over  OpenFlow  and  retrieves  the  flows.  If <u>remote</u> is specified, it must be an active OpenFlow
              connection method described in <b><a href="../man7/ovsdb.7.html">ovsdb</a></b>(7). Please see the discussion of the similar <b>--ovs</b> option  in
              <b><a href="../man8/ovn-trace.8.html">ovn-trace</a></b>(8) for more information about the OpenFlow flow output.

              By  default,  OpenFlow  flow  output  includes  only match and actions. Add <b>--stats</b> to include all
              OpenFlow information, such as packet and byte counters, duration, and timeouts.

              If <b>--vflows</b> is included, other southbound database records directly used for  generating  OpenFlow
              flows  are also listed. This includes: <u>port-bindings</u>, <u>mac-bindings</u>, <u>multicast-groups</u>, <u>chassis</u>. The
              <b>--ovs</b> and <b>--stats</b> can also be used in conjunction with <b>--vflows</b>.

       [<b>--uuid</b>] <b>dump-flows</b> [<u>logical-datapath</u>]
              Alias for <b>lflow-list</b>.

       <b>count-flows</b> [<u>logical-datapath</u>]
              prints numbers of logical flows per table and per datapath.

   <b>Remote</b> <b>Connectivity</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands manipulate the <b>connections</b> column in the <b>SB_Global</b> table and rows in the <b>Connection</b> table.
       When <b>ovsdb-server</b> is configured to use the <b>connections</b> column for  OVSDB  connections,  this  allows  the
       administrator to use \fBovn\-sbctl\fR to configure database connections.

              <b>get-connection</b>
                     Prints the configured connection(s).

              <b>del-connection</b>
                     Deletes the configured connection(s).

              [<b>--inactivity-probe=</b><u>msecs</u>] <b>set-connection</b> <u>target</u>...
                     Sets the configured manager target or targets. Use <b>--inactivity-probe=</b><u>msecs</u> to override the
                     default idle connection inactivity probe time. Use 0 to disable inactivity probes.

   <b>SSL/TLS</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Commands</b>
       When <b>ovsdb-server</b> is configured to connect using SSL/TLS, the following parameters are required:

              <u>private-key</u>
                     Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used for SSL/TLS connections.

              <u>certificate</u>
                     Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing a certificate, signed by the certificate authority (CA)
                     used by the connection peers, that certifies the private  key,  identifying  a  trustworthy
                     peer.

              <u>ca-cert</u>
                     Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate used to verify that the connection peers
                     are trustworthy.

       These SSL/TLS settings apply to all SSL/TLS connections made by the southbound database server.

              <b>get-ssl</b>
                     Prints the SSL/TLS configuration.

              <b>del-ssl</b>
                     Deletes the current SSL/TLS configuration.

              [<b>--bootstrap</b>] <b>set-ssl</b> <u>private-key</u> <u>certificate</u> <u>ca-cert</u> [<u>ssl-protocol-list</u> [<u>ssl-cipher-list</u> [<u>ssl-</u>
              <u>ciphersuites</u>]]]
                     Sets the SSL/TLS configuration.

   <b>Database</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These  commands query and modify the contents of <b>ovsdb</b> tables. They are a slight abstraction of the <b>ovsdb</b>
       interface and as such they operate at a lower level than other <b>ovn-sbctl</b> commands.

       <u>Identifying</u> <u>Tables,</u> <u>Records,</u> <u>and</u> <u>Columns</u>

       Each of these commands has a <u>table</u> parameter to identify a table within the database. Many of  them  also
       take  a  <u>record</u> parameter that identifies a particular record within a table. The <u>record</u> parameter may be
       the UUID for a record, which may be abbreviated to its first 4 (or more) hex digits, as long as  that  is
       unique.  Many tables offer additional ways to identify records. Some commands also take <u>column</u> parameters
       that identify a particular field within the records in a table.

       For a list of tables and their columns, see <b><a href="../man5/ovn-sb.5.html">ovn-sb</a></b>(5) or see the table listing from the <b>--help</b> option.

       Record names must be specified in full  and  with  correct  capitalization,  except  that  UUIDs  may  be
       abbreviated  to  their first 4 (or more) hex digits, as long as that is unique within the table. Names of
       tables and columns are not case-sensitive, and <b>-</b> and <b>_</b> are treated interchangeably. Unique  abbreviations
       of  table  and  column  names  are  acceptable, e.g. <b>d</b> or <b>dhcp</b> is sufficient to identify the <b>DHCP_Options</b>
       table.

       <u>Database</u> <u>Values</u>

       Each column in the database accepts a fixed type of data. The currently defined basic  types,  and  their
       representations, are:

              integer
                     A decimal integer in the range -2**63 to 2**63-1, inclusive.

              real   A floating-point number.

              Boolean
                     True or false, written <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>, respectively.

              string An  arbitrary  Unicode  string, except that null bytes are not allowed. Quotes are optional
                     for most strings that begin with an English  letter  or  underscore  and  consist  only  of
                     letters,  underscores, hyphens, and periods. However, <b>true</b> and <b>false</b> and strings that match
                     the syntax of UUIDs (see below) must be enclosed in double quotes to distinguish them  from
                     other basic types. When double quotes are used, the syntax is that of strings in JSON, e.g.
                     backslashes  may be used to escape special characters. The empty string must be represented
                     as a pair of double quotes (<b>""</b>).

              UUID   Either   a   universally   unique   identifier   in   the   style   of   RFC   4122,   e.g.
                     <b>f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6</b>, or an <b>@</b><u>name</u> defined by a <b>get</b> or <b>create</b> command within
                     the same <b>ovs-vsctl</b> invocation.

       Multiple values in a single column may be separated by spaces or a single comma. When multiple values are
       present,  duplicates  are  not allowed, and order is not important. Conversely, some database columns can
       have an empty set of values, represented as <b>[]</b>, and square brackets may  optionally  enclose  other  non-
       empty sets or single values as well.

       A  few  database columns are ``maps’’ of key-value pairs, where the key and the value are each some fixed
       database type. These are specified in the form <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>, where <u>key</u> and <u>value</u> follow the syntax  for  the
       column’s key type and value type, respectively. When multiple pairs are present (separated by spaces or a
       comma),  duplicate  keys  are  not  allowed,  and  again the order is not important. Duplicate values are
       allowed. An empty map is represented as <b>{}</b>. Curly braces may optionally enclose non-empty  maps  as  well
       (but  use  quotes  to  prevent  the  shell  from  expanding  <b>other-config={0=x,1=y}</b> into <b>other-config=0=x</b>
       <b>other-config=1=y</b>, which may not have the desired effect).

       <u>Database</u> <u>Command</u> <u>Syntax</u>

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] [<b>--columns=</b><u>column</u>[<b>,</b><u>column</u>]...] <b>list</b> <u>table</u> [<u>record</u>]...
                     Lists the data in each specified <u>record</u>. If no records are specified, lists all the records
                     in <u>table</u>.

                     If <b>--columns</b> is specified, only the requested columns are listed, in the  specified  order.
                     Otherwise, all columns are listed, in alphabetical order by column name.

                     Without  <b>--if-exists</b>,  it  is  an  error  if  any  specified  <u>record</u>  does  not exist. With
                     <b>--if-exists</b>, the command ignores any <u>record</u> that does  not  exist,  without  producing  any
                     output.

              [<b>--columns=</b><u>column</u>[<b>,</b><u>column</u>]...] <b>find</b> <u>table</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>]...
                     Lists  the  data in each record in <u>table</u> whose <u>column</u> equals <u>value</u> or, if <u>key</u> is specified,
                     whose <u>column</u> contains a <u>key</u> with the specified <u>value</u>. The following operators may  be  used
                     where <b>=</b> is written in the syntax summary:

                     <b>=</b> <b>!=</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>&lt;=</b> <b>&gt;=</b>
                            Selects  records  in  which  <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]  equals,  does not equal, is less than, is
                            greater than, is less than or equal to, or  is  greater  than  or  equal  to  <u>value</u>,
                            respectively.

                            Consider  <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]  and <u>value</u> as sets of elements. Identical sets are considered
                            equal. Otherwise, if the sets have different numbers of elements, then the set  with
                            more  elements  is  considered to be larger. Otherwise, consider a element from each
                            set pairwise, in increasing order within each  set.  The  first  pair  that  differs
                            determines  the  result.  (For a column that contains key-value pairs, first all the
                            keys are compared, and values are considered only if the two sets contain  identical
                            keys.)

                     <b>{=}</b> <b>{!=}</b>
                            Test for set equality or inequality, respectively.

                     <b>{&lt;=}</b>   Selects   records  in  which  <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]  is  a  subset  of  <u>value</u>.  For  example,
                            <b>flood-vlans{&lt;=}1,2</b> selects records in which the <b>flood-vlans</b> column is the empty  set
                            or contains 1 or 2 or both.

                     <b>{&lt;}</b>    Selects  records  in  which  <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]  is a proper subset of <u>value</u>. For example,
                            <b>flood-vlans{&lt;}1,2</b> selects records in which the <b>flood-vlans</b> column is the  empty  set
                            or contains 1 or 2 but not both.

                     <b>{&gt;=}</b> <b>{&gt;}</b>
                            Same  as  <b>{&lt;=}</b>  and <b>{&lt;}</b>, respectively, except that the relationship is reversed. For
                            example, <b>flood-vlans{&gt;=}1,2</b> selects records in which the <b>flood-vlans</b> column contains
                            both 1 and 2.

                     The following operators are available only in Open vSwitch 2.16 and later:

                     <b>{in}</b>   Selects records in which every element in <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>] is also in  <u>value</u>.  (This  is
                            the same as <b>{&lt;=}</b>.)

                     <b>{not-in}</b>
                            Selects records in which every element in <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>] is not in <u>value</u>.

                     For  arithmetic operators (<b>=</b> <b>!=</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>&lt;=</b> <b>&gt;=</b>), when <u>key</u> is specified but a particular record’s
                     <u>column</u> does not contain <u>key</u>, the record is always  omitted  from  the  results.  Thus,  the
                     condition  <b>other-config:mtu!=1500</b>  matches  records  that have a <b>mtu</b> key whose value is not
                     1500, but not those that lack an <b>mtu</b> key.

                     For the set operators, when <u>key</u> is specified but a  particular  record’s  <u>column</u>  does  not
                     contain   <u>key</u>,   the  comparison  is  done  against  an  empty  set.  Thus,  the  condition
                     <b>other-config:mtu{!=}1500</b> matches records that have a <b>mtu</b> key whose value is  not  1500  and
                     those that lack an <b>mtu</b> key.

                     Don’t forget to escape <b>&lt;</b> or <b>&gt;</b> from interpretation by the shell.

                     If  <b>--columns</b>  is specified, only the requested columns are listed, in the specified order.
                     Otherwise all columns are listed, in alphabetical order by column name.

                     The UUIDs shown for rows created in the same <b>ovs-vsctl</b> invocation will be wrong.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] [<b>--id=@</b><u>name</u>] <b>get</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]]...
                     Prints the value of each specified <u>column</u> in the given <u>record</u> in <u>table</u>. For map columns,  a
                     <u>key</u>  may optionally be specified, in which case the value associated with <u>key</u> in the column
                     is printed, instead of the entire map.

                     Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if <u>record</u> does not exist or <u>key</u> is  specified,  if  <u>key</u>
                     does not exist in <u>record</u>. With <b>--if-exists</b>, a missing <u>record</u> yields no output and a missing
                     <u>key</u> prints a blank line.

                     If  <b>@</b><u>name</u>  is  specified, then the UUID for <u>record</u> may be referred to by that name later in
                     the same <b>ovs-vsctl</b> invocation in contexts where a UUID is expected.

                     Both <b>--id</b> and the <u>column</u> arguments are optional, but usually at  least  one  or  the  other
                     should  be  specified.  If  both  are omitted, then <b>get</b> has no effect except to verify that
                     <u>record</u> exists in <u>table</u>.

                     <b>--id</b> and <b>--if-exists</b> cannot be used together.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>set</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>...
                     Sets the value of each specified <u>column</u> in the given <u>record</u> in  <u>table</u>  to  <u>value</u>.  For  map
                     columns,  a <u>key</u> may optionally be specified, in which case the value associated with <u>key</u> in
                     that column is changed (or added, if none exists), instead of the entire map.

                     Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if  <u>record</u>  does  not  exist.  With  <b>--if-exists</b>,  this
                     command does nothing if <u>record</u> does not exist.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>add</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> [<u>key</u><b>=</b>]<u>value</u>...
                     Adds  the  specified  value  or key-value pair to <u>column</u> in <u>record</u> in <u>table</u>. If <u>column</u> is a
                     map, then <u>key</u> is required, otherwise it is prohibited. If  <u>key</u>  already  exists  in  a  map
                     column,  then the current <u>value</u> is not replaced (use the <b>set</b> command to replace an existing
                     value).

                     Without <b>--if-exists</b>, it is an error if  <u>record</u>  does  not  exist.  With  <b>--if-exists</b>,  this
                     command does nothing if <u>record</u> does not exist.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> <u>value</u>...

                     [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> <u>key</u>...

                     [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>remove</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u> <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>...  Removes the specified values or key-
                     value  pairs from <u>column</u> in <u>record</u> in <u>table</u>. The first form applies to columns that are not
                     maps: each specified <u>value</u> is removed from the column. The second and third forms apply  to
                     map  columns:  if  only  a  <u>key</u> is specified, then any key-value pair with the given <u>key</u> is
                     removed, regardless of its value; if a <u>value</u> is given then a pair is removed only  if  both
                     key and value match.

                     It is not an error if the column does not contain the specified key or value or pair.

                     Without  <b>--if-exists</b>,  it  is  an  error  if  <u>record</u> does not exist. With <b>--if-exists</b>, this
                     command does nothing if <u>record</u> does not exist.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>clear</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> <u>column</u>...
                     Sets each <u>column</u> in <u>record</u> in <u>table</u> to the empty set or empty  map,  as  appropriate.  This
                     command applies only to columns that are allowed to be empty.

                     Without  <b>--if-exists</b>,  it  is  an  error  if  <u>record</u> does not exist. With <b>--if-exists</b>, this
                     command does nothing if <u>record</u> does not exist.

              [<b>--id=(@</b><u>name</u>|<u>uuid</u>)] <b>create</b> <u>table</u> <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>...
                     Creates a new record in <u>table</u> and sets the initial  values  of  each  <u>column</u>.  Columns  not
                     explicitly set will receive their default values. Outputs the UUID of the new row.

                     If  <b>@</b><u>name</u>  is  specified,  then  the  UUID  for the new row may be referred to by that name
                     elsewhere in the same  <b>\*(PN</b>  invocation  in  contexts  where  a  UUID  is  expected.  Such
                     references may precede or follow the <b>create</b> command.

                     If a valid <u>uuid</u> is specified, then it is used as the UUID of the new row.

                     Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                            Records  in  the Open vSwitch database are significant only when they can be reached
                            directly or indirectly from the <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table. Except for records in the <b>QoS</b> or
                            <b>Queue</b> tables, records that  are  not  reachable  from  the  <b>Open_vSwitch</b>  table  are
                            automatically  deleted from the database. This deletion happens immediately, without
                            waiting for additional <b>ovs-vsctl</b> commands or other database activity. Thus, a <b>create</b>
                            command must generally  be  accompanied  by  additional  commands  <u>within</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>same</u>
                            <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  <u>invocation</u>  to add a chain of references to the newly created record from
                            the top-level <b>Open_vSwitch</b> record. The <b>EXAMPLES</b> section  gives  some  examples  that
                            show how to do this.

              [<b>--if-exists</b>] <b>destroy</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u>...
                     Deletes  each  specified  <u>record</u>  from <u>table</u>. Unless <b>--if-exists</b> is specified, each <u>record</u>s
                     must exist.

              <b>--all</b> <b>destroy</b> <u>table</u>
                     Deletes all records from the <u>table</u>.

                     Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                            The <b>destroy</b> command is only useful for records in the <b>QoS</b> or <b>Queue</b>  tables.  Records
                            in  other  tables  are  automatically  deleted  from  the  database when they become
                            unreachable from the <b>Open_vSwitch</b> table. This means that deleting the last reference
                            to a record is sufficient for deleting the  record  itself.  For  records  in  these
                            tables,  <b>destroy</b>  is  silently  ignored.  See  the  <b>EXAMPLES</b>  section below for more
                            information.

              <b>wait-until</b> <u>table</u> <u>record</u> [<u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u>]...
                     Waits until <u>table</u> contains a record named <u>record</u> whose <u>column</u> equals <u>value</u> or,  if  <u>key</u>  is
                     specified,  whose <u>column</u> contains a <u>key</u> with the specified <u>value</u>. This command supports the
                     same operators and semantics described for the <b>find</b> command above.

                     If no <u>column</u>[<b>:</b><u>key</u>]<b>=</b><u>value</u> arguments are given, this command waits only until <u>record</u>  exists.
                     If more than one such argument is given, the command waits until all of them are satisfied.

                     Caution (ovs-vsctl as example)
                            Usually <b>wait-until</b> should be placed at the beginning of a set of <b>ovs-vsctl</b> commands.
                            For  example,  <b>wait-until</b>  <b>bridge</b>  <b>br0</b>  <b>--</b>  <b>get</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>br0</b> <b>datapath_id</b> waits until a
                            bridge named <b>br0</b> is created, then prints its <b>datapath_id</b> column, whereas <b>get</b>  <b>bridge</b>
                            <b>br0</b>  <b>datapath_id</b>  <b>--</b>  <b>wait-until</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>br0</b> will abort if no bridge named <b>br0</b> exists
                            when <b>ovs-vsctl</b> initially connects to the database.

                     Consider  specifying  <b>--timeout=0</b>  along  with  <b>--wait-until</b>,  to  prevent  <b>ovs-vsctl</b>  from
                     terminating after waiting only at most 5 seconds.

              <b>comment</b> [<u>arg</u>]...
                     This  command has no effect on behavior, but any database log record created by the command
                     will include the command and its arguments.
