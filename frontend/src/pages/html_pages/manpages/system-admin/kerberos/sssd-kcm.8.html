       sssd-kcm - SSSD Kerberos Cache Manager

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page describes the configuration of the SSSD Kerberos Cache Manager (KCM). KCM is a process
       that stores, tracks and manages Kerberos credential caches. It originates in the Heimdal Kerberos
       project, although the MIT Kerberos library also provides client side (more details on that below) support
       for the KCM credential cache.

       In a setup where Kerberos caches are managed by KCM, the Kerberos library (typically used through an
       application, like e.g., <b><a href="../man1/kinit.1.html">kinit</a></b>(1), is a “"KCM client"” and the KCM daemon is being referred to as a “"KCM
       server"”. The client and server communicate over a UNIX socket.

       The KCM server keeps track of each credential caches's owner and performs access check control based on
       the UID and GID of the KCM client. The root user has access to all credential caches.

       The KCM credential cache has several interesting properties:

       •   since the process runs in userspace, it is subject to UID namespacing, unlike the kernel keyring

       •   unlike the kernel keyring-based cache, which is shared between all containers, the KCM server is a
           separate process whose entry point is a UNIX socket

       •   the SSSD implementation stores the ccaches in a database, typically located at <u>/var/lib/sss/secrets</u>
           allowing the ccaches to survive KCM server restarts or machine reboots.

       This allows the system to use a collection-aware credential cache, yet share the credential cache between
       some or no containers by bind-mounting the socket.

       The KCM default client idle timeout is 5 minutes, this allows more time for user interaction with command
       line tools such as kinit.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>KCM</b> <b>CREDENTIAL</b> <b>CACHE</b></h4><pre>
       In order to use KCM credential cache, it must be selected as the default credential type in <b><a href="../man5/krb5.conf.5.html">krb5.conf</a></b>(5),
       The credentials cache name must be only “KCM:” without any template expansions. For example:

           [libdefaults]
               default_ccache_name = KCM:

       Next, make sure the Kerberos client libraries and the KCM server must agree on the UNIX socket path. By
       default, both use the same path <u>/var/run/.heim_org.h5l.kcm-socket</u>. To configure the Kerberos library,
       change its “kcm_socket” option which is described in the <b><a href="../man5/krb5.conf.5.html">krb5.conf</a></b>(5) manual page.

       Finally, make sure the SSSD KCM server can be contacted. The KCM service is typically socket-activated by
       <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1). Unlike other SSSD services, it cannot be started by adding the “kcm” string to the “service”
       directive.

           systemctl start sssd-kcm.socket
           systemctl enable sssd-kcm.socket

       Please note your distribution may already configure the units for you.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>CREDENTIAL</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>STORAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The credential caches are stored in a database, much like SSSD caches user or group entries. The database
       is typically located at “/var/lib/sss/secrets”.

</pre><h4><b>OBTAINING</b> <b>DEBUG</b> <b>LOGS</b></h4><pre>
       The sssd-kcm service is typically socket-activated <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1). To generate debug logs, add the following
       either to the /etc/sssd/sssd.conf file directly or as a configuration snippet to /etc/sssd/conf.d/
       directory:

           [kcm]
           debug_level = 10

       Then, restart the sssd-kcm service:

           systemctl restart sssd-kcm.service

       Finally, run whatever use-case doesn't work for you. The KCM logs will be generated at
       /var/log/sssd/sssd_kcm.log. It is recommended to disable the debug logs when you no longer need the
       debugging to be enabled as the sssd-kcm service can generate quite a large amount of debugging
       information.

       Please note that configuration snippets are, at the moment, only processed if the main configuration file
       at /etc/sssd/sssd.conf exists at all.

</pre><h4><b>RENEWALS</b></h4><pre>
       The sssd-kcm service can be configured to attempt TGT renewal for renewable TGTs stored in the KCM
       ccache. Renewals are only attempted when half of the ticket lifetime has been reached. KCM Renewals are
       configured when the following options are set in the [kcm] section:

           tgt_renewal = true
           krb5_renew_interval = 60m

       SSSD can also inherit krb5 options for renewals from an existing domain.

           tgt_renewal = true
           tgt_renewal_inherit = domain-name

       The following krb5 options can be configured in the [kcm] section to control renewal behavior, these
       options are described in detail below

           krb5_renew_interval
           krb5_renewable_lifetime
           krb5_lifetime
           krb5_validate
           krb5_canonicalize
           krb5_auth_timeout

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The KCM service is configured in the “kcm” section of the sssd.conf file. Please note that because the
       KCM service is typically socket-activated, it is enough to just restart the “sssd-kcm” service after
       changing options in the “kcm” section of sssd.conf:

           systemctl restart sssd-kcm.service

       The KCM service is configured in the “kcm” For a detailed syntax reference, refer to the “FILE FORMAT”
       section of the <b><a href="../man5/sssd.conf.5.html">sssd.conf</a></b>(5) manual page.

       The generic SSSD service options such as “debug_level” or “fd_limit” are accepted by the kcm service.
       Please refer to the <b><a href="../man5/sssd.conf.5.html">sssd.conf</a></b>(5) manual page for a complete list. In addition, there are some
       KCM-specific options as well.

       socket_path (string)
           The socket the KCM service will listen on.

           Default: <u>/var/run/.heim_org.h5l.kcm-socket</u>

           Note: on platforms where systemd is supported, the socket path is overwritten by the one defined in
           the sssd-kcm.socket unit file.

       max_ccaches (integer)
           How many credential caches does the KCM database allow for all users.

           Default: 0 (unlimited, only the per-UID quota is enforced)

       max_uid_ccaches (integer)
           How many credential caches does the KCM database allow per UID. This is equivalent to “with how many
           principals you can kinit”.

           Default: 64

       max_ccache_size (integer)
           How big can a credential cache be per ccache. Each service ticket accounts into this quota.

           Default: 65536

       tgt_renewal (bool)
           Enables TGT renewals functionality.

           Default: False (Automatic renewals disabled)

       tgt_renewal_inherit (string)
           Domain to inherit krb5_* options from, for use with TGT renewals.

           Default: NULL

       krb5_auth_timeout (integer)
           Timeout in seconds after an online authentication request or change password request is aborted. If
           possible, the authentication request is continued offline.

           Default: 6

       krb5_validate (boolean)
           Verify with the help of krb5_keytab that the TGT obtained has not been spoofed. The keytab is checked
           for entries sequentially, and the first entry with a matching realm is used for validation. If no
           entry matches the realm, the last entry in the keytab is used. This process can be used to validate
           environments using cross-realm trust by placing the appropriate keytab entry as the last entry or the
           only entry in the keytab file.

           Default: false (IPA and AD provider: true)

           Please note that the ticket validation is the first step when checking the PAC (see 'pac_check' in
           the <b><a href="../man5/sssd.conf.5.html">sssd.conf</a></b>(5) manual page for details). If ticket validation is disabled the PAC checks will be
           skipped as well.

       krb5_renewable_lifetime (string)
           Request a renewable ticket with a total lifetime, given as an integer immediately followed by a time
           unit:

           <u>s</u> for seconds

           <u>m</u> for minutes

           <u>h</u> for hours

           <u>d</u> for days.

           If there is no unit given, <u>s</u> is assumed.

           NOTE: It is not possible to mix units. To set the renewable lifetime to one and a half hours, use
           '90m' instead of '1h30m'.

           Default: not set, i.e. the TGT is not renewable

       krb5_lifetime (string)
           Request ticket with a lifetime, given as an integer immediately followed by a time unit:

           <u>s</u> for seconds

           <u>m</u> for minutes

           <u>h</u> for hours

           <u>d</u> for days.

           If there is no unit given <u>s</u> is assumed.

           NOTE: It is not possible to mix units. To set the lifetime to one and a half hours please use '90m'
           instead of '1h30m'.

           Default: not set, i.e. the default ticket lifetime configured on the KDC.

       krb5_renew_interval (string)
           The time in seconds between two checks if the TGT should be renewed. TGTs are renewed if about half
           of their lifetime is exceeded, given as an integer immediately followed by a time unit:

           <u>s</u> for seconds

           <u>m</u> for minutes

           <u>h</u> for hours

           <u>d</u> for days.

           If there is no unit given, <u>s</u> is assumed.

           NOTE: It is not possible to mix units. To set the renewable lifetime to one and a half hours, use
           '90m' instead of '1h30m'.

           If this option is not set or is 0 the automatic renewal is disabled.

           Default: not set

       krb5_canonicalize (boolean)
           Specifies if the host and user principal should be canonicalized. This feature is available with MIT
           Kerberos 1.7 and later versions.

           Default: false
