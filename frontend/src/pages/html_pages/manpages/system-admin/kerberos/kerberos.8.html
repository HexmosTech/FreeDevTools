       kerberos — introduction to the Kerberos system

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Kerberos  is  a network authentication system. Its purpose is to securely authenticate users and services
       in an insecure network environment.

       This is done with a Kerberos server acting as a trusted third party, keeping a database with secret  keys
       for all users and services (collectively called <u>principals</u>).

       Each  principal  belongs  to  exactly  one <u>realm</u>, which is the administrative domain in Kerberos. A realm
       usually corresponds to an organisation, and the realm should normally be derived from that organisation's
       domain name. A realm is served by one or more Kerberos servers.

       The authentication process involves exchange of ‘tickets’ and ‘authenticators’ which together  prove  the
       principal's identity.

       When  you  login  to  the  Kerberos  system,  either through the normal system login or with the <u><a href="../man1/kinit.1.html">kinit</a></u>(1)
       program, you acquire a <u>ticket</u> <u>granting</u> <u>ticket</u> which allows you to get new  tickets  for  other  services,
       such as <b>telnet</b> or <b>ftp</b>, without giving your password.

       For  more information on how Kerberos works, and other general Kerberos questions see the Kerberos FAQ at
       <a href="http://www.cmf.nrl.navy.mil/krb/kerberos-faq.html">http://www.cmf.nrl.navy.mil/krb/kerberos-faq.html</a>.

       For setup instructions see the Heimdal Texinfo manual.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The Kerberos authentication system was developed in the late 1980's as part of the Athena Project at  the
       Massachusetts  Institute of Technology. Versions one through three never reached outside MIT, but version
       4 was (and still is) quite popular, especially in the academic community, but is also used in  commercial
       products like the AFS filesystem.

       The problems with version 4 are that it has many limitations, the code was not too well written (since it
       had  been developed over a long time), and it has a number of known security problems. To resolve many of
       these issues work on version five started, and resulted in IETF RFC 1510  in  1993.  IETF  RFC  1510  was
       obsoleted in 2005 with IETF RFC 4120, also known as Kerberos clarifications. With the arrival of IETF RFC
       4120, the work on adding extensibility and internationalization have started (Kerberos extensions), and a
       new RFC will hopefully appear soon.

       This  manual  page  is  part of the <b>Heimdal</b> Kerberos 5 distribution, which has been in development at the
       Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, since about 1997.
