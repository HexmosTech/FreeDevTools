</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       daptup - plugin for apt[itude] and cupt to list repository changes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>daptup</b> ( <b>--pre</b> | <b>--post</b> | <b>--last</b> ) [ <b>-h</b> | <b>--help</b> ] [ <b>--nocolor</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--pre</b>  Do only 'pre' stage: collect info that will be used as 'old'. Usually need to be specified only in
              apt hooks.

       <b>--post</b> Do  only  'post'  stage:  collect 'new' info and (if appropriate option is enabled in config file)
              output changes. Usually need to be specified only in apt hooks.

       <b>--last</b> Output changes only. This option is supposed to be specified when you want to see changes made  in
              the  last  update. Note that list of outdated packages, if daptup is configured to output it, will
              be rebuilt.

       <b>-h</b> <b>--help</b>
              prints the help

       <b>--nocolor</b>
              Disables color output, useful for scripts or when output is not  terminal.  Now  works  only  with
              <b>--last</b> option, however, you can disable color globally in configuration file.

       <b>daptup</b> is a script that outputs list of packages recently entered to repo, list of packages which got new
       updates, list of changes in 'watched' packages and, optionally, list of outdated packages.

       Starting  with  0.8.0 version, <b>daptup</b> uses apt hooks and you don't need to explicitly call it. It will be
       called automatically by all the supported package managers.

</pre><h4><b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       If <b>daptup</b> was interrupted while building the lists, the cached lists  can  stay  in  inconsistent  state,
       which  is inappropriate if you want to use <b>--last</b> option before the new update. There is nothing to do if
       interrupt occurred at the moment when old lists were building (besides running the new update).  However,
       if interrupt occurred when the new lists were building, you can easily redo this stage by calling 'daptup
       --post'.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/daptup.conf</b>
              self-documented configuration file

       <b>/var/spool/daptup/outdated</b>
              cached file with info about outdated packages
