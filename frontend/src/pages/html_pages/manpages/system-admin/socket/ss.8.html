</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ss - another utility to investigate sockets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ss</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>[</u> <u>FILTER</u> <u>]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ss</b>  is  used to dump socket statistics. It allows showing information similar to <u>netstat</u>.  It can display
       more TCP and state information than other tools.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       When no option is used ss displays a list of open non-listening sockets  (e.g.  TCP/UNIX/UDP)  that  have
       established connection.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show summary of options.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Output version information.

       <b>-H,</b> <b>--no-header</b>
              Suppress header line.

       <b>-Q,</b> <b>--no-queues</b>
              Suppress sending and receiving queue columns.

       <b>-O,</b> <b>--oneline</b>
              Print each socket's data on a single line.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--numeric</b>
              Do not try to resolve service names. Show exact bandwidth values, instead of human-readable.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--resolve</b>
              Try to resolve numeric address/ports.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--all</b>
              Display both listening and non-listening (for TCP this means established connections) sockets.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--listening</b>
              Display only listening sockets (these are omitted by default).

       <b>-B,</b> <b>--bound-inactive</b>
              Display  only  TCP bound but inactive (not listening, connecting, etc.) sockets (these are omitted
              by default).

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--options</b>
              Show timer information. For TCP protocol, the output format is:

              timer:(&lt;timer_name&gt;,&lt;expire_time&gt;,&lt;retrans&gt;)

                     allocate additional memory.

              <b>&lt;wmem_queued&gt;</b>
                     The memory allocated for sending packet (which has not been sent to layer 3)

       <b>--cgroup</b>
              Show cgroup information. Below fields may appear:

       <b>-K,</b> <b>--kill</b>
              Attempts to forcibly close sockets. This option displays sockets that are successfully closed  and
              silently skips sockets that the kernel does not support closing. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 sockets
              only.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--summary</b>
              Print  summary  statistics. This option does not parse socket lists obtaining summary from various
              sources. It is useful when amount of sockets is so huge that parsing <a href="file:/proc/net/tcp">/proc/net/tcp</a> is painful.

       <b>-E,</b> <b>--events</b>
              Continually display sockets as they are destroyed

       <b>-Z,</b> <b>--context</b>
              As the <b>-p</b> option but also shows process security context. If the <b>-T</b> option  is  used,  also  shows
              thread security context.

              For <b><a href="../man7/netlink.7.html">netlink</a></b>(7) sockets the initiating process context is displayed as follows:

                     1.  If valid pid show the process context.

                     2.  If destination is kernel (pid = 0) show kernel initial context.

                     3.  If  a  unique identifier has been allocated by the kernel or netlink user, show context
                         as "unavailable". This will generally indicate that a process has more than one netlink
                         socket active.

       <b>-z,</b> <b>--contexts</b>
              As the <b>-Z</b> option but also shows  the  socket  context.  The  socket  context  is  taken  from  the
              associated  inode  and  is not the actual socket context held by the kernel. Sockets are typically
              labeled with the context of the creating process, however  the  context  shown  will  reflect  any
              policy role, type and/or range transition rules applied, and is therefore a useful reference.

       <b>-N</b> <b>NSNAME,</b> <b>--net=NSNAME</b>
              Switch to the specified network namespace name.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--bpf</b>
              Show socket classic BPF filters (only administrators are allowed to get these information).

       <b>-4,</b> <b>--ipv4</b>
              Display only IP version 4 sockets (alias for -f inet).

       <b>-6,</b> <b>--ipv6</b>
              Display only IP version 6 sockets (alias for -f inet6).

       <b>-0,</b> <b>--packet</b>
              Display PACKET sockets (alias for -f link).

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--tcp</b>
              Display TCP sockets.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--udp</b>
              Display UDP sockets.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--dccp</b>
              Display DCCP sockets.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--raw</b>
              Display RAW sockets.

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--unix</b>
              Display Unix domain sockets (alias for -f unix).

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--sctp</b>
              Display SCTP sockets.

       <b>--tipc</b> Display tipc sockets (alias for -f tipc).

       <b>--vsock</b>
              Display vsock sockets (alias for -f vsock).

       <b>--xdp</b>  Display XDP sockets (alias for -f xdp).

       <b>-M,</b> <b>--mptcp</b>
              Display MPTCP sockets.

       <b>--inet-sockopt</b>
              Display inet socket options.

       <b>-f</b> <b>FAMILY,</b> <b>--family=FAMILY</b>
              Display  sockets  of  type  FAMILY.   Currently  the following families are supported: unix, inet,
              inet6, link, netlink, vsock, tipc, xdp.

       <b>-A</b> <b>QUERY,</b> <b>--query=QUERY,</b> <b>--socket=QUERY</b>
              List of socket tables to dump, separated by commas. The following identifiers are understood: all,
              inet, tcp, udp, raw, unix, packet, netlink, unix_dgram, unix_stream,  unix_seqpacket,  packet_raw,
              packet_dgram,  dccp,  sctp,  tipc, vsock_stream, vsock_dgram, xdp, mptcp. Any item in the list may
              optionally be prefixed by an exclamation mark (<b>!</b>)  to exclude that socket table from being dumped.

       <b>-D</b> <b>FILE,</b> <b>--diag=FILE</b>
              Do not display anything, just dump raw information  about  TCP  sockets  to  FILE  after  applying
              filters. If FILE is - stdout is used.

       <b>-F</b> <b>FILE,</b> <b>--filter=FILE</b>
              Read  filter  information  from  FILE.   Each line of FILE is interpreted like single command line
              option. If FILE is - stdin is used.

       <b>--bpf-maps</b>
              Pretty-print all the BPF socket-local data entries for each socket.

       <b>--bpf-map-id=MAP_ID</b>
              Pretty-print the BPF socket-local data entries for the requested map ID. Can  be  used  more  than
              once.

       <b>FILTER</b> <b>:=</b> <b>[</b> <b>state</b> <b>STATE-FILTER</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>EXPRESSION</b> <b>]</b>
              Please take a look at the official documentation for details regarding filters.

</pre><h4><b>STATE-FILTER</b></h4><pre>
       <b>STATE-FILTER</b> allows one to construct arbitrary set of states to match. Its syntax is sequence of keywords
       state and exclude followed by identifier of state.

       Available identifiers are:

              All  standard  TCP  states:  <b>established</b>,  <b>syn-sent</b>,  <b>syn-recv</b>, <b>fin-wait-1</b>, <b>fin-wait-2</b>, <b>time-wait</b>,
              <b>closed</b>, <b>close-wait</b>, <b>last-ack</b>, <b>listening</b> and <b>closing.</b>

              <b>all</b> - for all the states

              <b>connected</b> - all the states except for <b>listening</b> and <b>closed</b>

              <b>synchronized</b> - all the <b>connected</b> states except for <b>syn-sent</b>

              <b>bucket</b> - states, which are maintained as minisockets, i.e.  <b>time-wait</b> and <b>syn-recv</b>

              <b>big</b> - opposite to <b>bucket</b>

              <b>bound-inactive</b> - bound but otherwise inactive sockets (not listening, connecting, etc.)

</pre><h4><b>EXPRESSION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>EXPRESSION</b> allows filtering based on specific criteria.  <b>EXPRESSION</b> consists of a  series  of  predicates
       combined  by  boolean operators. The possible operators in increasing order of precedence are <b>or</b> (or | or
       ||), <b>and</b> (or &amp; or &amp;&amp;), and <b>not</b> (or !). If no operator is between consecutive predicates, an implicit  <b>and</b>
       operator is assumed. Subexpressions can be grouped with "(" and ")".

       The following predicates are supported:

       <b>{dst|src}</b> <b>[=]</b> <b>HOST</b>
              Test if the destination or source matches HOST. See HOST SYNTAX for details.

       <b>{dport|sport}</b> <b>[OP]</b> <b>[FAMILY:]:PORT</b>
              Compare  the  destination  or source port to PORT. OP can be any of "&lt;", "&lt;=", "=", "!=", "&gt;=" and
              "&gt;". Following normal arithmetic rules. FAMILY and PORT are as described in HOST SYNTAX below.

       <b>dev</b> <b>[=|!=]</b> <b>DEVICE</b>
              Match based on the device the connection uses. DEVICE can either be a device name or the index  of
              the interface.

       <b>fwmark</b> <b>[=|!=]</b> <b>MASK</b>
              Matches  based on the fwmark value for the connection. This can either be a specific mark value or
              a mark value followed by a "/" and a bitmask of which bits to use in the comparison.  For  example
              "fwmark = 0x01/0x03" would match if the two least significant bits of the fwmark were 0x01.

       <b>cgroup</b> <b>[=|!=]</b> <b>PATH</b>
              Match if the connection is part of a cgroup at the given path.

       <b>autobound</b>
              Match  if  the  port  or  path  of  the  source  address  was automatically allocated (rather than
              explicitly specified).

       Most operators have aliases. If no operator is supplied "=" is assumed.  Each of the following groups  of
       operators are all equivalent:

              • = == eq

              • != ne neq

              • &gt; gt

              • &lt; lt

              • &gt;= ge geq

              • &lt;= le leq

              • ! not

              • | || or

              • &amp; &amp;&amp; and

</pre><h4><b>HOST</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The general host syntax is [FAMILY:]ADDRESS[:PORT].

       FAMILY  must  be  one  of the families supported by the -f option. If not given it defaults to the family
       given with the -f option, and if that is also missing, will assume either inet or inet6.  Note  that  all
       host  conditions  in  the  expression  should either all be the same family or be only inet and inet6. If
       there is some other mixture of families, the results will probably be unexpected.

       The form of ADDRESS and PORT depends on the family used. "*" can be used as a  wildcard  for  either  the
       address or port. The details for each family are as follows:

       <b>unix</b>   ADDRESS  is  a  glob  pattern (see <b><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></b>(3)) that will be matched case-insensitively against the
              unix socket's address. Both path and abstract names are supported. Unix addresses do not support a
              port, and "*" cannot be used as a wildcard.

       <b>link</b>   ADDRESS is the case-insensitive name of an Ethernet protocol to match. PORT  is  either  a  device
              name or a device index for the desired link device, as seen in the output of ip link.

       <b>netlink</b>
              ADDRESS  is a descriptor of the netlink family. Possible values come from /etc/iproute2/nl_protos.
              PORT is the port id of the socket, which is usually the same as the owning process id.  The  value
              "kernel" can be used to represent the kernel (port id of 0).

       <b>vsock</b>  ADDRESS is an integer representing the CID address, and PORT is the port.

       <b>inet</b> and <b>inet6</b>
              ADDRESS is an ip address (either v4 or v6 depending on the family) or a DNS hostname that resolves
              to  an  ip  address  of  the  required version. An ipv6 address must be enclosed in "[" and "]" to
              disambiguate the port separator. The address may additionally have a prefix length given  in  CIDR
              notation  (a  slash  followed  by  the prefix length in bits). PORT is either the numerical socket
              port, or the service name for the port to match.
