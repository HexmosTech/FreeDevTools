       oping - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>oping</b> [<b>-4</b> | <b>-6</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>count</u>] [<b>-i</b> <u>interval</u>] <u>host</u> [<u>host</u> [<u>host</u> ...]]

       <b>oping</b> [<b>-4</b> | <b>-6</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>count</u>] [<b>-i</b> <u>interval</u>] <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>

       <b>noping</b> [<b>-4</b> | <b>-6</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>count</u>] [<b>-i</b> <u>interval</u>] <u>host</u> [<u>host</u> [<u>host</u> ...]]

       <b>noping</b> [<b>-4</b> | <b>-6</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>count</u>] [<b>-i</b> <u>interval</u>] <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>oping</b> uses ICMPv4 or ICMPv6 ECHO_REQUEST packets to measure a hosts reachability and the network latency.
       In contrast to the original <b><a href="../man8/ping.8.html">ping</a></b>(8) utility <b>oping</b> can send ICMP packets to multiple hosts in parallel and
       wait for all ECHO_RESPONSE packets to arrive. In contrast to the <b>fping</b> utility (URL is listed in "SEE
       ALSO") <b>oping</b> can use both, IPv4 and IPv6 transparently and side by side.

       <b>noping</b> is an ncurses-based front-end to <u>liboping</u> which displays ping statistics online and highlights
       aberrant round-trip times if the terminal supports colors.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-4</b>  Force the use of IPv4.

       <b>-6</b>  Force the use of IPv6.

       <b>-c</b> <u>count</u>
           Send (and receive) <u>count</u> ICMP packets, then stop and exit.

       <b>-i</b> <u>interval</u>
           Send one ICMP packet (per host) each <u>interval</u> seconds. This can be a floating-point number to specify
           sub-second precision.

       <b>-w</b> <u>timeout</u>
           Specifies  the  time  to  wait for an "ECHO REPLY" packet before giving up, in seconds. This can be a
           floating point number for sub-second precision. Defaults to <b>1.0</b> seconds.

       <b>-t</b> <u>ttl</u>
           Set the IP Time to Live to <u>ttl</u>. This must be a number between (and including) 1 and 255. If  omitted,
           the value <b>64</b> is used.

       <b>-I</b> <u>address</u>
           Set the source address to use. You may either specify an IP number or a hostname. You <b>cannot</b> pass the
           interface name, as you can with GNU's <b><a href="../man8/ping.8.html">ping</a></b>(8) - use the <b>-D</b> option for that purpose.

       <b>-D</b> <u>interface</u> <u>name</u>
           Set the outgoing network device to use.

       <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>
           Instead  of specifying hostnames on the command line, read them from <u>filename</u>. If <u>filename</u> is <b>-</b>, read
           from "STDIN".

           If <u>oping</u> is installed with the SetUID-bit, it will set the effective  UID  to  the  real  UID  before
           opening  the  file.  In  the special (but common) case that <u>oping</u> is owned by the super-user (UID 0),
           this means that privileges are temporarily dropped before opening the file, in order to prevent users
           from reading arbitrary files on the system.

           If your system doesn't provide <u>saved</u> <u>set-user</u> <u>IDs</u> (this was an optional feature  before  POSIX 2001),
           the  behavior is different because it is not possible to <u>temporarily</u> drop privileges. The alternative
           behavior is: If the real user ID (as returned by <b><a href="../man2/getuid.2.html">getuid</a></b>(2)) and the effective user ID (as returned by
           <b><a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid</a></b>(2)) differ, the only argument allowed for this option is "-" (i.e. standard input).

       <b>-O</b> <u>filename</u>
           Write measurements in <u>Comma</u> <u>Separated</u> <u>Values</u> (CSV) format to  <u>filename</u>.   This  option  writes  three
           columns  per  row:  wall  clock time in (fractional) seconds since epoch, hostname and the round trip
           time in milliseconds.

       <b>-Q</b> <u>qos</u>
           Specify the <u>Quality</u> <u>of</u> <u>Service</u> (QoS) for outgoing packets. This is a somewhat  tricky  option,  since
           the meaning of the bits in the IPv4 header has been revised several times.

           The  currently  recommended  method is <u>Differentiated</u> <u>Services</u> which is used in IPv6 headers as well.
           There are shortcuts for various predefined <u>per-hop</u> <u>behaviors</u> (PHBs):

           <b>be</b>  Selects the <u>Best</u> <u>Effort</u> behavior. This is the default behavior.

           <b>ef</b>  Selects the <u>Expedited</u> <u>Forwarding</u> (EF) per-hop behavior, as  defined  in  <u>RFC</u> <u>3246</u>.  This  PHB  is
               characterised by low delay, low loss and low jitter, i.e. high priority traffic.

           <b>va</b>  Selects  the  <u>Voice</u> <u>Admitted</u> (VA) per-hop behavior, as defined in <u>RFC</u> <u>5865</u>. This traffic class is
               meant for <u>Voice</u> <u>over</u> <u>IP</u> (VoIP) traffic which uses <u>Call</u>  <u>Admission</u>  <u>Control</u>  (CAC)  for  reserving
               network capacity.

           <b>af</b><u>cp</u>
               Selects  one  of  12 differentiated  services  code  points  (DSCPs), which are organized in four
               <u>classes</u> with three <u>priorities</u> each. Therefore, <u>c</u> must be a number between 1 through 4 and <u>p</u>  must
               be  a number between 1 through 3, for example "af13", "af22" and "af41". In each class, the lower
               priority number takes precedence over the higher priority number.

           <b>cs</b><u>n</u> Selects one of the eight <u>Class</u> <u>Selector</u> PHBs. <u>n</u>  is  a  number  between 0  through 7.  The  class
               selectors  have  been  defined  to  be  compatible  to the <u>Precedence</u> field in the IPv4 header as
               defined in <u>RFC</u> <u>791</u>. Please note that "cs0" is synonymous to "be".

           The old definition of the same bits in the IPv4 header was as <u>Type</u> <u>of</u> <u>Service</u> (ToS) field,  specified
           in  <u>RFC</u> <u>1349</u>.  It  defined four possible values which have appropriate aliases. Please note that this
           use of the bits is <b>deprecated</b> and the meaning is limited to IPv4!

           <b>lowdelay</b>
               Minimize delay

           <b>throughput</b>
               Maximize throughput

           <b>reliability</b>
               Maximize reliability

           <b>mincost</b>
               Minimize monetary cost

           Alternatively, you can also specify the byte manually. You can use either a decimal number (0-255), a
           hexadecimal number (0x00-0xff) or an octal number (00-0377) using the usual "0x" and "0" prefixes for
           hexadecimal and octal respectively.

           The printed lines will contain information about the QoS field of received packets if either  a  non-
           standard QoS setting was used on outgoing packets or if the QoS byte of incoming packets is not zero.
           In  other  words, the QoS information is omitted if both, the outgoing and the incoming QoS bytes are
           zero. The received byte is always interpreted  as  <u>Differentiated</u>  <u>Services</u>  <u>Code</u>  <u>Point</u>  (DSCP)  and
           <u>Explicit</u>  <u>Congestion</u>  <u>Notification</u>  (ECN),  even if the deprecated <u>Type</u> <u>of</u> <u>Service</u> (ToS) aliases were
           used to specify the bits of outgoing packets.

       <b>-m</b> <u>mark</u>
           <u>Linux</u> <u>only</u> Sets the <u>mark</u> (an integer number) on outgoing packets. This can be used by <b><a href="../man8/iptables.8.html">iptables</a></b>(8) and
           other networking infrastructure for filtering and routing.

       <b>-u</b>|<b>-U</b>
           <u>noping</u> <u>only</u> <b>-u</b> forces UTF-8 output, <b>-U</b> disables UTF-8 output. If neither is  given,  the  codeset  is
           automatically determined from the locale.

       <b>-g</b> <b>none</b>|<b>prettyping</b>|<b>boxplot</b>|<b>histogram</b>
           <u>noping</u> <u>only</u> Selects the graph to display.

           <b>none</b>
               Do not show a graph.

           <b>prettyping</b>
               Show  a graph with time on the x-axis, the y-axis shows the round-trip time.  This is the default
               graph.

               If your terminal supports unicode and colors, they are used to improve the precision of the  data
               shown:  a  green box is drawn for round-trip times up to one third of the configured timeout, the
               height representing the RTT. Longer RTTs will  start  to  fill  the  box  yellow  (with  a  green
               background)  and  then  red  (with  a  yellow  background). Lost packages are drawn as a bold red
               explamation mark.

           <b>boxplot</b>
               Show a <u>box</u> <u>plot</u> where the x-axis, i.e. the width of the  window,  is  the  round-trip  time.  The
               entire width of the window it the ping interval, set with the <b>-i</b> option.

               The  box  is  sized  so  it  contains 50% of the replies. The vertical line shows the median. The
               whiskers are sized to contain 95% of the replies -- 2.5% below the whiskers and 2.5% above.

                 |----------[#####|##########]--------------------------------------------|
                 ^          ^     ^          ^                                            ^
                2.5%       25%   50%        75%                                         97.5%

           <b>histogram</b>
               Show a <u>histrogram</u> of the round-trip times. The width of the window is taken  as  round-trip  time
               from 0ms on the left to the <u>interval</u> (the <b>-i</b> option, default 1000ms) on the right.

               The  height  of  the graph is scaled so that the most-used buckets vertically fills the line. The
               buckets are colored green up to and including the 80th percentile, yellow up to and including the
               95th percentile and red for the remainder.

       <b>-H</b> <u>height</u>
           Sets the height of the boxs containing each graph.  The &lt;height&gt; must be a number between  1  and  5.
           The default is <b>5</b> lines, which shows the maximum amount of information.  Reducing the size will remove
           the  textual information and will eventually remove the box drawn around the graph - showing only the
           graph when set to <b>1</b> line.

       <b>-b</b>  Audible bell. Print a ASCII BEL character (\a or 0x07) when a packet is received before  the  timeout
           occurs. This can be useful in order to monitory hosts' connectivity without looking physically at the
           console,  for example to trace network cables (start audible beep, disconnect cable N: if beep stops,
           the cable was in use) or to tell when a host returns from a reboot.

           This relies on the terminal bell to be functional. To enable the terminal  bell,  use  the  following
           instructions.

           •   the  visual  bell  is  disabled  in  your terminal emulator, with the +vb commandline flag or the
               following in your .Xresources:

                XTerm*visualBell: false

           •   the PC speaker module is loaded in your kernel:

                modprobe pcspkr

           •   X11 has the terminal bell enabled:

                xset b on; xset b 100

           •   and finally, if you are using PulseAudio, that the module-x11-bell module is loaded with  a  pre-
               loaded sample defined in your pulseaudio configuration:

                load-sample-lazy x11-bell /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga
                load-module module-x11-bell sample=x11-bell

       <b>-P</b> <u>percent</u>
           Configures  the  latency  percentile  to  report.  <u>percent</u>  must  be  a  number between zero and 100,
           exclusively in both cases. In general, defaults to <b>95</b>.  If <b>-c</b> is given and a  number  less  than  20,
           this  would  be  the  same as the maximum. In this case the default is chosen so that it excludes the
           maximum, e.g. if <b>-c</b> <b>5</b> is given, the default is <u>80</u>. The calculated percentile is based on the last 900
           packets (15 minutes with the default interval).

       <b>-Z</b> <u>percent</u>
           If any hosts have a drop rate higher than <u>percent</u>, where <u>percent</u> is a number  between  zero  and  100
           inclusively,  exit  with a non-zero exit status.  Since it is not possible to have a higher drop rate
           than 100%, passing this limit will effectively disable the feature (the default). Setting the  option
           to zero means that the exit status will only be zero if <u>all</u> replies for <u>all</u> hosts have been received.

           The exit status will indicate the number of hosts with more than <u>percent</u> packets lost, up to a number
           of 255 failing hosts.

</pre><h4><b>COLORS</b></h4><pre>
       If  supported  by  the terminal, <u>noping</u> will highlight the round-trip times (RTT) using the colors green,
       yellow and red. Green signals RTTs that are in the "expected"  range,  yellow  marks  moderately  unusual
       times and times that differ a lot from the expected value are printed in red.

       The  information  used  to categorize round-trip times is the <u>percentile</u>. RTTs in the 80th percentile are
       considered to be "normal" and are printed in green.  RTTs  within  the  95th  percentile  are  considered
       "moderately  unusual"  and  are printed in yellow. RTTs above that are considered to be "unusual" and are
       printed in red.

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>CONTROLS</b></h4><pre>
       When running <u>noping</u>, the type of graph being displayed can be changed by using the <b>g</b> key.  The height  of
       the  graph  boxes  can also be increased and decreased with <b>+</b> and <b>-</b> keys.  A new host can be added at any
       time with the <b>a</b> key.
