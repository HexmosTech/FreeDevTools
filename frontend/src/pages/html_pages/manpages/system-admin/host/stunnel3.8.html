       stunnel - universal SSL tunnel

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>stunnel</b>   [-c ⎪ -T]   [-D [facility.]level]   [-O a⎪l⎪r:option=value[:value]]  [-o file]  [-C cipherlist]
       [-p pemfile]  [-v level]  [-A certfile]  [-S sources]  [-a directory]  [-t timeout]   [-u ident_username]
       [-s setuid_user]  [-g setgid_group]  [-n protocol]  [-P { filename ⎪ '' } ] [-B bytes] [-R randfile] [-W]
       [-E socket] [-I host] [-d [host:]port [-f] ] [ -r [host:]port ⎪ { -l ⎪ -L } program [-- progname args] ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>stunnel</b> program is designed to work as <u>SSL</u>  encryption  wrapper  between  remote  clients  and  local
       (<u>inetd</u>-startable)  or  remote  servers.  The concept is that having non-SSL aware daemons running on your
       system you can easily set them up to communicate with clients over secure SSL channels.

       <b>stunnel</b> can be used to add SSL functionality to commonly used <u>inetd</u> daemons like POP-2, POP-3,  and  IMAP
       servers,  to  standalone  daemons  like  NNTP,  SMTP  and HTTP, and in tunneling PPP over network sockets
       without changes to the source code.

       This product includes cryptographic software written by Eric Young (<a href="mailto:eay@cryptsoft.com">eay@cryptsoft.com</a>)

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>  Print stunnel help menu

       <b>-D</b> level
           Debugging level

           Level is a one of the syslog level names or numbers emerg (0), alert (1), crit (2), err (3),  warning
           (4), notice (5), info (6), or debug (7).  All logs for the specified level and all levels numerically
           less  than  it  will  be  shown.  Use -D debug or -D 7 for greatest debugging output.  The default is
           notice (5).

           The syslog facility 'daemon' will be used unless a facility name is supplied.   (Facilities  are  not
           supported on windows.)

           Case is ignored for both facilities and levels.

       <b>-O</b> a⎪l⎪r:option=value[:value]
           Set an option on accept/local/remote socket

           The values for linger option are l_onof:l_linger. The values for time are tv_sec:tv_usec.

           <b>Examples:</b>

           <b>-O</b> <b>l:SO_LINGER=1:60</b> - set one minute timeout for closing local socket

           <b>-O</b> <b>r:TCP_NODELAY=1</b> - turn off the Nagle algorithm for remote sockets

           <b>-O</b> <b>r:SO_OOBINLINE=1</b> - place out-of-band data directly into the receive data stream for remote sockets

           <b>-O</b> <b>a:SO_REUSEADDR=0</b> - disable address reuse (enabled by default)

           <b>-O</b> <b>a:SO_BINDTODEVICE=lo</b> - only accept connections on loopback interface

           The available options and their defaults are:
               Option          Accept    Local     Remote    OS default
               SO_DEBUG            --        --        --             0

               TCP_NODELAY         --        --        --             0

       <b>-o</b> file
           Append log messages to a file.

       <b>-C</b> cipherlist
           Select permitted SSL ciphers

           A   colon   delimited   list   of   the  ciphers  to  allow  in  the  SSL  connection.   For  example
           DES-CBC3-SHA:IDEA-CBC-MD5

       <b>-c</b>  client mode (remote service uses SSL)

           default: server mode

       <b>-T</b>  transparent proxy mode

           Re-write address to appear as if wrapped daemon is connecting from the SSL client machine instead  of
           the  machine  running  stunnel. Available only on some operating systems (Linux only, we believe) and
           then only in server mode. Note that this option will not combine with  proxy  mode  (-r)  unless  the
           client's  default  route to the target machine lies through the host running stunnel, which cannot be
           localhost.

       <b>-p</b> pemfile
           private key and certificate chain PEM file name

           A PEM is always needed in server mode (by default located  in  <u>/etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem</u>).  Specifying
           this  flag in client mode will use this key and certificate chain as a client side certificate chain.
           Using client side certs is optional. The certificates must be  in  PEM  format  and  must  be  sorted
           starting with the certificate to the highest level (root CA).

       <b>-v</b> level
           verify peer certificate

           •       level 1 - verify peer certificate if present

           •       level 2 - verify peer certificate

           •       level 3 - verify peer with locally installed certificate

           •       default - no verify

       <b>-a</b> directory
           client certificate directory

           This  is  the  directory  in which stunnel will look for certificates when using the <u>-v</u> options. Note
           that the certificates in this directory should be named XXXXXXXX.0 where XXXXXXXX is the  hash  value
           of the cert.

       <b>-A</b> certfile
           Certificate Authority file

           This file contains multiple CA certificates, used with the <u>-v</u> options.

       <b>-t</b> timeout
           session cache timeout

           default: 300 seconds.

       <b>-N</b> servicename
           Service  name  to  use  for  tcpwrappers.  If  not  specified  then a tcpwrapper service name will be
           generated automatically for you. This will also be used when auto-generating pid filenames.

       <b>-u</b> ident_username
           Use IDENT (RFC 1413) username checking

       <b>-n</b> proto
           Negotiate SSL with specified protocol

           currently supported: smtp, pop3, nntp

       <b>-E</b> socket
           Entropy Gathering Daemon socket to use to feed OpenSSL random number generator.  (Available  only  if
           compiled with OpenSSL 0.9.5a or higher)

       <b>-R</b> filename
           File  containing random input.  The SSL library will use data from this file first to seed the random
           number generator.

       <b>-W</b>  Do not overwrite the random seed files with new random data.

       <b>-B</b> bytes
           Number of bytes of data read from random seed files.   With  SSL  versions  less  than  0.9.5a,  also
           determines  how  many  bytes of data are considered sufficient to seed the PRNG.  More recent OpenSSL
           versions have a builtin function to determine when sufficient randomness is available.

       <b>-I</b> host
           IP of the outgoing interface is used as source for remote connections.  Use this  option  to  bind  a
           static local IP address, instead.

       <b>-d</b> [host:]port
           daemon mode

           Listen  for  connections  on  [host:]port. If no host specified, defaults to all IP addresses for the
           local host.

           default: inetd mode

       <b>-f</b>  foreground mode

           Stay in foreground (don't fork) and log to stderr instead of via syslog (unless -o is specified).

           default: background in daemon mode

       <b>-l</b> program [-- programname [arg1 arg2 arg3...]  ]
           execute local inetd-type program.

       <b>-L</b> program [-- programname [arg1 arg2 arg3...]  ]
           open local pty and execute program.

       <b>-s</b> username
           <u>setuid()</u> to username in daemon mode

       <b>-g</b> groupname
           <u>setgid()</u> to groupname in daemon mode. Clears all other groups.

       <b>-P</b> { file ⎪ '' }
           Pid file location

           If the argument is a filename, then that filename will be used for the pid. If the argument is  empty
           ('', not missing), then no pid file will be created.

       <b>-r</b> [host:]port
           connect to remote service

           If no host specified, defaults to localhost.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       In order to provide SSL encapsulation to your local <u>imapd</u> service, use

         stunnel -d 993 -l /usr/sbin/imapd -- imapd

       In  order  to  let  your  local  e-mail  client connect to a SSL-enabled <u>imapd</u> service on another server,
       configure the e-mail client to connect to localhost on port 119 and use:

         stunnel -c -d 143 -r servername:993

       If you want to provide tunneling to your <u>pppd</u> daemon on port 2020, use something like

         stunnel -d 2020 -L /usr/sbin/pppd -- pppd local

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       If Stunnel is used to create local processes using the <b>-l</b> or  <b>-L</b>  options,  it  will  set  the  following
       environment variables

       REMOTE_HOST
           The IP address of the remote end of the connection.

       SSL_CLIENT_DN
           The  DN  (Distinguished Name, aka subject name) of the peer certificate, if a certificate was present
           and verified.

       SSL_CLIENT_I_DN
           The Issuer's DN of the peer's certificate, if a certificate was present and verified.

</pre><h4><b>CERTIFICATES</b></h4><pre>
       •   Each SSL enabled daemon needs to present a valid X.509 certificate to  the  peer.  It  also  needs  a
           private  key  to  decrypt the incoming data.  The easiest way to obtain a certificate and a key is to
           generate them with the free <u>openssl</u> package. You can find more information on certificates generation
           on pages listed below.

           Two things are important when generating certificate-key pairs for <b>stunnel</b>. The private key cannot be
           encrypted, because the server has no way to  obtain  the  password  from  the  user.  To  produce  an
           unencrypted key add the <u>-nodes</u> option when running the <b>req</b> command from the <u>openssl</u> kit.

           The  order  of contents of the <u>.pem</u> file is also important. It should contain the unencrypted private
           key first, then a signed certificate (not certificate request). There  should  be  also  empty  lines
           after certificate and private key. Plaintext certificate information appended on the top of generated
           certificate should be discarded. So the file should look like this:

             -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
             [encoded key]
             -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
             [empty line]
             -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
             [encoded certificate]
             -----END CERTIFICATE-----
             [empty line]

</pre><h4><b>RANDOMNESS</b></h4><pre>
       •   <u>stunnel</u>  needs  to  seed  the  PRNG  (pseudo  random  number  generator) in order for SSL to use good
           randomness.  The following sources are  loaded  in  order  until  sufficient  random  data  has  been
           gathered:

           •       The file specified with the <u>-R</u> flag.

           •       The file specified by the RANDFILE environment variable, if set.

           •       The file .rnd in your home directory, if RANDFILE not set.

           •       The file specified with '--with-random' at compile time.

           •       The contents of the screen if running on Windows.

           •       The egd socket specified with the <u>-E</u> flag.

           •       The egd socket specified with '--with-egd-sock' at compile time.

           •       The /dev/urandom device.

           With  recent  (&gt;=OpenSSL  0.9.5a)  version of SSL it will stop loading random data automatically when
           sufficient entropy has been gathered.  With previous versions it will continue to gather from all the
           above sources since no SSL function exists to tell when enough data is available.

           Note that on Windows machines that do not have console user interaction  (mouse  movements,  creating
           windows,  etc) the screen contents are not variable enough to be sufficient, and you should provide a
           random file for use with the <u>-R</u> flag.

           Note that the file specified with the <u>-R</u> flag should contain random data  --  that  means  it  should
           contain  different information each time <u>stunnel</u> is run.  This is handled automatically unless the <u>-W</u>
           flag is used.  If you wish to update this file manually, the <u>openssl</u> <u>rand</u> command in recent  versions
           of OpenSSL, would be useful.

           One  important  note -- if /dev/urandom is available, OpenSSL has a habit of seeding the PRNG with it
           even when checking the random state, so on systems with /dev/urandom you're likely  to  use  it  even
           though  it's  listed  at  the  very  bottom  of the list above.  This isn't stunnel's behaviour, it's
           OpenSSLs.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       •   <u>stunnel</u> cannot be used for the FTP daemon because of the nature of the FTP  protocol  which  utilizes
           multiple  ports  for  data  transfers.   There  are  available SSL enabled versions of FTP and telnet
           daemons, however.
