       opahostadmin

       <b>(Host)</b>  Performs  a  number  of  multi-step  host  initialization  and verification operations, including
       upgrading software or firmware, rebooting hosts, and other operations. In general,  operations  performed
       by opahostadmin involve a login to one or more host systems.

                           to average host performance).

</pre><h4><b>Example</b></h4><pre>
       opahostadmin -c reboot

       opahostadmin upgrade

       opahostadmin -h 'elrond arwen' reboot

       HOSTS='elrond arwen' opahostadmin reboot

</pre><h4><b>Details</b></h4><pre>
       opahostadmin provides detailed logging of its results. During each run, the following files are produced:

       •      test.res : Appended with summary results of run.

       •      test.log : Appended with detailed results of run.

       •      save_tmp/ : Contains a directory per failed test with detailed logs.

       •      test_tmp*/ : Intermediate result files while test is running.

       The -c option removes all log files.

       Results from opahostadmin are grouped into test suites, test cases,  and  test  items.  A  given  run  of
       opahostadmin  represents  a  single test suite. Within a test suite, multiple test cases occur; typically
       one test case per host being operated on. Some of the more complex  operations  may  have  multiple  test
       items per test case. Each test item represents a major step in the overall test case.

       Each  opahostadmin  run  appends to test.res and test.log, and creates temporary files in test_tmp$PID in
       the current directory. test.res provides an overall summary of operations performed  and  their  results.
       The  same  information  is  also  displayed  while  opahostadmin is executing. test.log contains detailed
       information about what was performed, including the specific commands executed and the resulting  output.
       The  test_tmp  directories  contain temporary files which reflect tests in progress (or killed). The logs
       for any failures are logged in the save_temp directory with a directory per failed test case. If the same
       test case fails more than once, save_temp retains the information from the first failure. Subsequent runs
       of opahostadmin are appended to test.log. Intel recommends reviewing failures and using the -c option  to
       remove old logs before subsequent runs of opahostadmin.

       opahostadmin  implicitly  performs  its  operations  in  parallel.  However,  as  for  the  other  tools,
       <b>FF_MAX_PARALLEL</b> can be exported to change the degree of parallelism.  1000  parallel  operations  is  the
       default.

</pre><h4><b>Environment</b> <b>Variables</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables are also used by this command:

       <b>HOSTS</b>

                 List of hosts, used if -h option not supplied.

       <b>HOSTS_FILE</b>

                 File containing list of hosts, used in absence of -f and -h.

       <b>FF_MAX_PARALLEL</b>

                 Maximum concurrent operations are performed.

       <b>FF_SERIALIZE_OUTPUT</b>

                 Serialize output of parallel operations (yes or no).

       <b>FF_TIMEOUT_MULT</b>

                 Multiplier for all timeouts associated with this command. Used if the systems are slow for some
                 reason.

</pre><h4><b>opahostadmin</b> <b>Operation</b> <b>Details</b></h4><pre>
       <b>(Host)</b> Intel recommends that you set up password SSH or SCP for use during this operation. Alternatively,
       the  -S option can be used to securely prompt for a password, in which case the same password is used for
       all hosts. Alternately, the password may be put in the environment or the opafastfabric.conf  file  using
       <b>FF_PASSWORD</b> and <b>FF_ROOTPASS</b>.

       load

                 Performs  an  initial  installation  of  Intel(R)  Omni-Path  Software on a group of hosts. Any
                 existing  installation  is  uninstalled  and  existing   configuration   files   are   removed.
                 Subsequently, the hosts are installed with a default Intel(R) Omni-Path Software configuration.
                 The  -I  option  can be used to select different install packages. Default is oftools ipoib mpi
                 The -r option can be used to specify a release to install other than the one that this host  is
                 presently  running.  The  <u>FF_PRODUCT</u>. <u>FF_PRODUCT_VERSION</u>.tgz file (for example, IntelOPA-Basic.
                 <u>version</u>.tgz) is expected to exist in the directory specified by  -d.  Default  is  the  current
                 working directory. The specified software is copied to all the selected hosts and installed.

       upgrade

                 Upgrades  all  selected  hosts  without  modifying  existing  configurations. This operation is
                 comparable to the -U option when running ./INSTALL manually. The  -r  option  can  be  used  to
                 upgrade to a release different from this host. The default is to upgrade to the same release as
                 this   host.   The   <u>FF_PRODUCT</u>.  <u>FF_PRODUCT_VERSION</u>.tgz  file  (for  example,  IntelOPA-Basic.
                 <u>version</u>.tgz) is expected to exist in the directory specified by -d. The default is the  current
                 working directory. The specified software is copied to all the end nodes and installed.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
              Only  components that are currently installed are upgraded. This operation fails for hosts that do
              not have Intel(R) Omni-Path Software installed.

       configipoib

                 Creates a ifcfg-ib1 configuration file for each node using  the  IP  address  found  using  the
                 resolver  on  the  node.  The  standard  Linux*  resolver is used through the host command. (If
                 running OFA Delta, this option configures ifcfg-ib0 .)

                 If the host is not found, <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> on the node is checked. The -i option specifies  an  IPoIB
                 suffix to apply to the host name to create the IPoIB host name for the node. The default suffix
                 is  -ib.  The  -m  option  specifies a netmask other than the default for the given class of IP
                 address, such as when dividing a class A or  B  address  into  smaller  IP  subnets.  IPoIB  is
                 configured  for  a  static  IP address and is autostarted at boot. For the Intel(R) OP Software
                 Stack, the default /etc/ipoib.cfg file is used, which provides a redundant IPoIB  configuration
                 using both ports of the first HFI in the system.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
              opahostadmin  configipoib  now  supports  DHCP  (auto or static options) for configuring the IPoIB
              interface.  You  must  specify  these   options   in   /etc/opa/opafastfabric.conf   against   the
              <b>FF_IPOIB_CONFIG</b> variable. If no options are found, the static IP configuration is used by default.
              If  auto is specified, then one IP address from either static or dhcp is chosen. Static is used if
              the IP address can be obtained out of <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> or the resolver, otherwise DHCP is used.

       reboot

                 Reboots the given hosts and ensures they go down and come back up by pinging  them  during  the
                 reboot  process.  The  ping  rate is slow (5 seconds), so if the servers boot faster than this,
                 false failures may be seen.

       sacache

                 Verifies the given hosts can properly communicate with the SA and any cached SA data that is up
                 to date. To run this command, Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric software must be installed and  running
                 on  the  given hosts. The subnet manager and switches must be up. If this test fails: opacmdall
                 'opasaquery -o desc' can be run against any problem hosts.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
              This operation requires that the hosts being queried are specified by  a  resolvable  TCP/IP  host
              name. This operation FAILS if the selected hosts are specified by IP address.

       ipoibping

                 Verifies  IPoIB  basic  operation  by  ensuring  that the host can ping all other nodes through
                 IPoIB. To run this command, Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric software must be installed, IPoIB must be
                 configured and running on the host, and the given hosts, the SM, and switches must be  up.  The
                 -i option can specify an alternate IPoIB hostname suffix.

       mpiperf

                 Verifies  that MPI is operational and checks MPI end-to-end latency and bandwidth between pairs
                 of nodes (for example, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6). Use this to verify switch latency/hops,  PCI  bandwidth,
                 and  overall  MPI  performance.  The  test.res  file contains the results of each pair of nodes
                 tested.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
              This option is available for the Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric Host Software OFA Delta packaging,  but
              is not presently available for other packagings of OFED.

              To obtain accurate results, this test should be run at a time when no other stressful applications
              (for example, MPI jobs or high stress file system operations) are running on the given hosts.

              Bandwidth issues typically indicate server configuration issues (for example, incorrect slot used,
              incorrect  BIOS  settings,  or incorrect HFI model), or fabric issues (for example, symbol errors,
              incorrect link width, or speed). Assuming opareport has previously been used  to  check  for  link
              errors and link speed issues, the server configuration should be verified.

              Note  that  BIOS settings and differences between server models can account for 10-20% differences
              in bandwidth. For more details about BIOS settings, consult  the  documentation  from  the  server
              supplier and/or the server PCI chipset manufacturer.

       mpiperfdeviation

                 Specifies  the enhanced version of mpiperf that verifies MPI performance. Can be used to verify
                 switch latency/hops, PCI bandwidth, and overall MPI performance. It performs assorted pair-wise
                 bandwidth and latency tests, and reports pairs outside an acceptable tolerance range. The  tool
                 identifies  specific  nodes  that  have problems and provides a concise summary of results. The
                 test.res file contains the results of each pair of nodes tested.

                 By default, concurrent mode is used to quickly analyze the fabric and host  performance.  Pairs
                 that  have  20%  less  bandwidth  or  50%  more  latency  than the average pair are reported as
                 failures.

                 The tool can be run in a sequential or a  concurrent  mode.  Sequential  mode  runs  each  host
                 against  a  reference  host.  By  default,  the  reference  host  is selected based on the best
                 performance from a quick test of the first 40 hosts. In concurrent mode, hosts  are  paired  up
                 and all pairs are run concurrently. Since there may be fabric contention during such a run, any
                 poor performing pairs are then rerun sequentially against the reference host.

                 Concurrent  mode  runs  the tests in the shortest amount of time, however, the results could be
                 slightly less accurate due to switch contention. In heavily oversubscribed fabric  designs,  if
                 concurrent mode is producing unexpectedly low performance, try sequential mode.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
              This  option is available for the Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric Host Software OFA Delta packaging, but
              is not presently available for other packagings of OFED.

              To obtain accurate results, this test should be run at a time when no other stressful applications
              (for example, MPI jobs, high stress file system operations) are running on the given hosts.

              Bandwidth issues typically indicate server configuration issues (for example, incorrect slot used,
              incorrect BIOS settings, or incorrect HFI model), or fabric issues (for  example,  symbol  errors,
              incorrect  link  width,  or  speed). Assuming opareport has previously been used to check for link
              errors and link speed issues, the server configuration should be verified.

              Note that BIOS settings and differences between server models can account for  10-20%  differences
              in  bandwidth.  A result 5-10% below the average is typically not cause for serious alarm, but may
              reflect limitations in the server design or the chosen BIOS settings.

              For more details about BIOS settings, consult the documentation from the  server  supplier  and/or
              the server PCI chipset manufacturer.

              The  deviation  application  supports  a number of parameters which allow for more precise control
              over the mode, benchmark and pass/fail criteria. The parameters to use can be selected  using  the
              <b>FF_DEVIATION_ARGS</b> configuration parameter in opafastfabric.conf
