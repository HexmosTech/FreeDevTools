</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       opauploadall

       <b>(Linux)</b> Copies one or more files from a group of hosts to this system. Since the file name is the same on
       each  host,  a  separate  directory on this system is created for each host and the file is copied to it.
       This is a convenient way to upload log files or configuration files for review. This  tool  can  also  be
       used  in  conjunction  with opadownloadall to upload a host specific configuration file, edit it for each
       host, and download the new version to all the hosts.

       <b>NOTE:</b> To copy files from this host to hosts in the cluster, use opascpall or opadownloadall. user@  style
       syntax cannot be used when specifying filenames.

</pre><h4><b>Syntax</b></h4><pre>
       opauploadall [-rp] [-f  <u>hostfile</u>] [-d  <u>upload_dir</u>] [-h '<u>hosts</u>'] [-u  <u>user</u>] <u>source_file</u> ...  <u>dest_file</u>

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       --help

                 Produces full help text.

       -p

                 Performs copy in parallel on all hosts.

       -r

                 Performs recursive upload of directories.

       -f <u>hostfile</u>

                 Specifies the file with hosts in cluster.
                 Default is /etc/opa/hosts file.

       -h <u>hosts</u>

                 Specifies the list of hosts to upload from.

       -u <u>user</u>

                 Specifies the user to perform copy to. Default is current user code.

       -d <u>upload_dir</u>

                 Specifies  the  directory  to  upload to. Default is uploads. If not specified, the environment
                 variable <b>UPLOADS_DIR</b> is used. If that is not exported, the default, /uploads, is used.

       <u>source_file</u>

                 Specifies the name of files to copy to this system, relative to the current directory. Multiple
                 files may be listed.

       <u>dest_file</u>

                 Specifies the name of the file or directory on this system  to  copy  to.  It  is  relative  to
                 <u>upload_dir</u>/<u>HOSTNAME</u> .A local directory within  <u>upload_dir</u>/ is created for each hostname.

                 Each uploaded file is copied to upload_dir/<u>HOSTNAME</u>/<u>dest_file</u> within the local system.

                 If more than one source file is specified or dest_file has a trailing / , a dest_file directory
                 will be created.
