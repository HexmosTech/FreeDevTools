       opafindgood

       Checks  for  hosts  that  are  able  to be pinged, accessed via SSH, and active on the Intel(R) Omni-Path
       Fabric. Produces a list of good hosts meeting all criteria. Typically used  to  identify  good  hosts  to
       undergo further testing and benchmarking during initial cluster staging and startup.

       The  resulting  good  file lists each good host exactly once and can be used as input to create <u>mpi_hosts</u>
       files for running mpi_apps and the HFI-SW cable test. The files alive, running, active, good, and bad are
       created in the selected directory listing hosts passing each criteria.

       This command assumes the Node Description for each host is based on the <u>hostname</u>-s output in  conjunction
       with  an  optional  hfi1_#  suffix.  When  using  a  /etc/opa/hosts  file  that lists the hostnames, this
       assumption may not be correct.

       This command automatically generates the file FF_RESULT_DIR/punchlist.csv. This file provides  a  concise
       summary  of the bad hosts found. This can be imported into Excel directly as a *.csv file. Alternatively,
       it can be cut/pasted into Excel, and the <b>Data/Text</b> <b>to</b>  <b>Columns</b>  toolbar  can  be  used  to  separate  the
       information into multiple columns at the semicolons.

       A sample generated output is:

       # opafindgood

       3 hosts will be checked

       2 hosts are pingable (alive)

       2 hosts are ssh'able (running)

       2 total hosts have FIs active on one or more fabrics (active)

       No Quarantine Node Records Returned

       1 hosts are alive, running, active (good)

       2 hosts are bad (bad)

       Bad hosts have been added to /root/punchlist.csv

       # cat /root/punchlist.csv

       2015/10/07 10:21:05;phs1swivd13u06;Switch not found in SA DB

       2015/10/09 14:36:48;phs1fnivd13u07n4;Doesn't ping

       2015/10/09 14:36:48;phs1fnivd13u07n3;No active port

       For  a  given run, a line is generated for each failing host. Hosts are reported exactly once for a given
       run. Therefore, a host that does not ping is NOT listed as can't ssh nor No active  port.  There  may  be
       cases  where ports could be active for hosts that do not ping, especially if Ethernet host names are used
       for the ping test. However, the lack of ping often implies there are other fundamental  issues,  such  as
       PXE  boot or inability to access DNS or DHCP to get proper host name and IP address. Therefore, reporting
       hosts that do not ping is typically of limited value.

       Note that opafindgood queries the SA for NodeDescriptions to determine hosts with active ports. As  such,
       ports may be active for hosts that cannot be accessed via SSH or pinged.

       By  default,  opafindgood checks for and reports nodes that are quarantined for security reasons. To skip
       this, use the -Q option.

</pre><h4><b>Syntax</b></h4><pre>
       opafindgood [-R|-A|-Q] [-d  <u>dir</u>] [-f  <u>hostfile</u>] [-h '<u>hosts</u>']
       [-t  <u>portsfile</u>] [-p  <u>ports</u>] [-T  <u>timelimit</u>]

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       --help

                 Produces full help text.

       -R

                 Skips the running test (SSH). Recommended if password-less SSH is not set up.

       -A

                 Skips the active test. Recommended if Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric software or fabric is not up.

       -Q

                 Skips the quarantine test. Recommended if Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric software or fabric  is  not
                 up.

       -d <u>dir</u>

                 Specifies the directory in which to create alive, active, running, good, and bad files. Default
                 is /etc/opa directory.

       -f <u>hostfile</u>

                 Specifies the file with hosts in cluster. Default is /etc/opa/hosts directory.

       -h <u>hosts</u>

                 Specifies the list of hosts to ping.

       -t <u>portsfile</u>

                 Specifies  the file with list of local HFI ports used to access fabric(s) for analysis. Default
                 is /etc/opa/ports file.

       -p <u>ports</u>

                 Specifies the list of local HFI ports used to access fabric(s) for analysis.

                 Default is first active port. The first HFI in the system is 1. The first port on an HFI is  1.
                 Uses the format hfi:port,
                 for example:

                 0:0       First active port in system.

                 0:y       Port <u>y</u> within system.

                 x:0       First active port on HFI <u>x</u>.

                 x:y       HFI <u>x</u>, port <u>y</u>.

       -T <u>timelimit</u>

                 Specifies the time limit in seconds for host to respond to SSH. Default is 20 seconds.
