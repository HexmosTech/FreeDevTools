</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mtinkd - daemon to control your EPSON printer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>mtinkd</b> [-dev <u>device_file</u>] [-name <u>model</u>] [-usbbase <u>pattern_device_file</u>] [-nodaemaon] [-model <u>model_name</u>]
              [-debug] [[start] | [stop] | [status]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>mtinkd</b> command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not
       have a manual page.

       <b>mtinkd</b> is a status monitor for EPSON ink jet printer

       It permits one to watch the remaining ink while printing.

       As it keeps /dev/lp* open, you have to change your printing parameter to link the printer to
       /var/run/mtink/printer

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes
       (`-'). A summary of options is included below.

       Options for <b>mtinkd</b>

       <b>-dev</b> <u>device_file</u>
           This option is mandatory and is also used in order to get the status or to stop a running server.
           Device file is the name of the character device on which the printer is attached (/dev/lp0,
           /dev/usb/lp0, /dev/ecpp0).

       <b>-nodaemon</b>
           This option is for test purpose, without this option mtink start in the background.

       <b>-name</b> <u>model</u>
           If the printer don't return it identity you may tell which printer is attached. The name is derived
           from the official name and space characters are to be replaced by the "_" character. This will be the
           case for the Stylus Scan 2500 (model name is Scan_2500).

           This option may also be useful for multifunction device as the Stylus Photo 895 under Linux. If the
           printer is powered off and then on, the usb kernel will not detect the printer properly and mtinkd
           must be at least stopped and started again.

       <b>-model</b> <u>model_name</u>
           The name of the named pipe will be set according to this name. If the -model option is not given,
           mtinkd will terminate if the identification returned don't comply with passed name.

       <b>-usbbase</b>
           This option requires a special system call which is only implemented into newer kernels.

           The -type name option is required !

           path and device file base may be /usr/usblp or /usr/usb/lp. All device files matching whith the
           passed name will be scanned for the wanted printer, the device file will then be used later.

           If the kernel don't support the special call, scanning will fail and if the -dev device_file option
           was given, the given device file name will then be used.

       <b>start</b>
           The server will be started. start may be ommited.

       <b>stop</b>
           An running server will be stopped.

       <b>status</b>
           This allow to ask if a server is running.
