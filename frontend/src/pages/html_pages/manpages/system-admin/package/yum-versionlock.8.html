</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       yum-versionlock - redirecting to DNF versionlock Plugin

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>versionlock</u>  is  a  plugin  that  takes  a  set of names and versions for packages and excludes all other
       versions of those packages. This allows you to protect packages from being  updated  by  newer  versions.
       Alternately,  it accepts a specific package version to exclude from updates, e.g. for when it’s necessary
       to skip a specific release of a package that has known issues.

       The plugin provides a command <u>versionlock</u> which allows you to view and edit the list of  locked  packages
       easily.

       The  plugin  will  walk  each  line  of  the  versionlock file, and parse out the name and version of the
       package. It will then exclude any package by that name that doesn’t match  one  of  the  versions  listed
       within  the  file.  This  is basically the same as using <u>dnf</u> <u>–exclude</u> for the package name itself (as you
       cannot exclude installed packages), but dnf will still see the versions you have  installed/versionlocked
       as available so that <u>dnf</u> <u>reinstall</u> will still work, etc.

       It  can  also work in the opposite way, like a fast exclude, by prefixing a ‘!’  character to the version
       recorded in the lock list file. This specifically excludes a package that matches the version exactly.

       Note the versionlock plugin does not apply any excludes in non-transactional operations  like  <u>repoquery</u>,
       <u>list</u>, <u>info</u>, etc.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dnf</b> <b>versionlock</b> <b>[options]</b> <b>[add|exclude|list|delete|clear]</b> <b>[&lt;package-name-spec&gt;]</b>

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>&lt;package-name-spec&gt;</b>
              Package spec to lock or exclude.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCOMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dnf</b> <b>versionlock</b> <b>add</b> <b>&lt;package-name-spec&gt;</b>
              Add  a  versionlock  for  all available packages matching the spec. It means that only versions of
              packages represented by <b>&lt;package-name-spec&gt;</b> will be available for  transaction  operations.   Each
              <b>&lt;package-name-spec&gt;</b> is converted to concrete NEVRAs which are used for locking. The NEVRAs to lock
              to  are  first  searched  among  installed  packages  and then (if none is found) in all currently
              available packages.

              Examples:

                 Locking a package to the version installed:

                     $ dnf repoquery --installed bash
                     bash-0:5.0.7-1.fc30.x86_64

                     $ dnf repoquery bash
                     bash-0:5.0.2-1.fc30.i686
                     bash-0:5.0.2-1.fc30.x86_64
                     bash-0:5.0.7-1.fc30.i686
                     bash-0:5.0.7-1.fc30.x86_64

                     $ dnf versionlock add bash
                     Adding versionlock on: bash-0:5.0.7-1.fc30.*

                 Locking not installed package to any of available versions:

                     $ dnf repoquery --installed mutt

                     $ dnf repoquery mutt
                     mutt-5:1.11.4-1.fc30.x86_64
                     mutt-5:1.12.1-3.fc30.x86_64

                     $ dnf versionlock add mutt
                     Adding versionlock on: mutt-5:1.11.4-1.fc30.*
                     Adding versionlock on: mutt-5:1.12.1-3.fc30.*

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Be careful when adding specific versions

                 If you add a package specifying a  version  with  <b>dnf</b>  <b>versionlock</b>  <b>mutt-5:1.11.4-1.fc30.x86_64</b>
                 then, if you run <b>dnf</b> <b>versionlock</b> <b>add</b> <b>mutt</b> versionlock will not add <b>mutt-5:1.12.1-3.fc30.x86_64</b>.

       <b>dnf</b> <b>versionlock</b> <b>exclude</b> <b>&lt;package-name-spec&gt;</b>
              Add  an  exclude (within  versionlock) for the available packages matching the spec. It means that
              packages represented by <b>&lt;package-name-spec&gt;</b> will be excluded from transaction operations.

       <b>dnf</b> <b>versionlock</b> <b>list</b> <b>or</b> <b>dnf</b> <b>versionlock</b>
              List the current versionlock entries.

       <b>dnf</b> <b>versionlock</b> <b>delete</b> <b>&lt;package-name-spec&gt;</b>
              Remove any matching versionlock entries.

       <b>dnf</b> <b>versionlock</b> <b>clear</b>
              Remove all versionlock entries.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All general DNF options are accepted, see <u>Options</u> in <b><a href="../man8/dnf.8.html">dnf</a>(8)</b> for details.

       <b>--raw</b>  Do not resolve <b>&lt;package-name-spec&gt;</b> to  NEVRAs  to  find  specific  version  to  lock  to.  Instead
              <b>&lt;package-name-spec&gt;</b>  are  used  as they are. This enables locking to not yet available versions of
              the package.  For example you may want to keep the <u>bash</u> package on major version 5 and consume any
              future updates as far as they keep the major version:

                 $ dnf versionlock add --raw 'bash-5.*'
                 Adding versionlock on: bash-5.*

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/dnf/plugins/versionlock.conf</b>

       The minimal content of conf file should contain <b>main</b> sections with <b>enabled</b> and <b>locklist</b> parameters.

       <b>locklist</b>
              This option is a string that points to the file which has the versionlock information in it.  Note
              that  the  file  has  to  exist (or the versionlock plugin will make dnf exit). However, it can be
              empty.

              The file takes entries in the format of <b>&lt;package-name-spec&gt;</b>  (optionally  prefixed  with  ‘!’  for
              excludes).  See <u>Specifying</u> <u>packages</u> in <b><a href="../man8/dnf.8.html">dnf</a>(8)</b> for details.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       A specified package does not have to exist within the available cache of repository data to be considered
       valid  for locking or exclusion. This is by design, to accommodate use cases such as a presently disabled
       repository. However, a package must exist in the repository cache when the <b>add</b> or <b>exclude</b> subcommands are
       invoked for it.
