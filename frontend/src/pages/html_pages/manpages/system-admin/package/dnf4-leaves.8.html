</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dnf4-leaves - DNF leaves Plugin

       List installed packages not required by any other installed package.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dnf</b> <b>leaves</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>leaves</u>  lists all the packages installed on your system which are not required as a dependency of another
       installed package. However two or more packages might depend on eachother in a dependency cycle. Packages
       in such cycles, which are not required by any other package, are also listed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All general DNF options are accepted, see <u>Options</u> in <b><a href="../man8/dnf.8.html">dnf</a>(8)</b> for details.

</pre><h4><b>WHY</b> <b>IS</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>USEFUL?</b></h4><pre>
       The list gives you a nice overview of what is installed on your system without flooding you with anything
       required by the packages already shown.  The following list of arguments basically says the same thing in
       different ways:

       • All the packages on this list is either needed by you, other users of the system or not needed at all –
         if it was required by another installed package it would not be on the list.

       • If you want to uninstall anything from your system (without breaking dependencies) it must  involve  at
         least one package on this list.

       • If there is anything installed on the system which is not needed it must be on this list – otherwise it
         would be required as a dependency by another package.
