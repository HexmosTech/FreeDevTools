</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pacman - package manager utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>pacman</u> &lt;operation&gt; [options] [targets]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pacman is a package management utility that tracks installed packages on a Linux system. It features
       dependency support, package groups, install and uninstall scripts, and the ability to sync your local
       machine with a remote repository to automatically upgrade packages. Pacman packages are a zipped tar
       format.

       Since version 3.0.0, pacman has been the front-end to <b><a href="../man3/libalpm.3.html">libalpm</a></b>(3), the “Arch Linux Package Management”
       library. This library allows alternative front-ends to be written (for instance, a GUI front-end).

       Invoking pacman involves specifying an operation with any potential options and targets to operate on. A
       <u>target</u> is usually a package name, file name, URL, or a search string. Targets can be provided as command
       line arguments. Additionally, if stdin is not from a terminal and a single hyphen (-) is passed as an
       argument, targets will be read from stdin.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-D,</b> <b>--database</b>
           Operate on the package database. This operation allows you to modify certain attributes of the
           installed packages in pacman’s database. It also allows you to check the databases for internal
           consistency. See Database Options below.

       <b>-Q,</b> <b>--query</b>
           Query the package database. This operation allows you to view installed packages and their files, as
           well as meta-information about individual packages (dependencies, conflicts, install date, build
           date, size). This can be run against the local package database or can be used on individual package
           files. In the first case, if no package names are provided in the command line, all installed
           packages will be queried. Additionally, various filters can be applied on the package list. See Query
           Options below.

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--remove</b>
           Remove package(s) from the system. Groups can also be specified to be removed, in which case every
           package in that group will be removed. Files belonging to the specified package will be deleted, and
           the database will be updated. Most configuration files will be saved with a <u>.pacsave</u> extension unless
           the <u>--nosave</u> option is used. See Remove Options below.

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--sync</b>
           Synchronize packages. Packages are installed directly from the remote repositories, including all
           dependencies required to run the packages. For example, pacman -S qt will download and install qt and
           all the packages it depends on. If a package name exists in more than one repository, the repository
           can be explicitly specified to clarify the package to install: pacman -S testing/qt. You can also
           specify version requirements: pacman -S "bash&gt;=3.2". Quotes are needed, otherwise the shell
           interprets "&gt;" as redirection to a file.

           In addition to packages, groups can be specified as well. For example, if gnome is a defined package
           group, then pacman -S gnome will provide a prompt allowing you to select which packages to install
           from a numbered list. The package selection is specified using a space- and/or comma-separated list
           of package numbers. Sequential packages may be selected by specifying the first and last package
           numbers separated by a hyphen (-). Excluding packages is achieved by prefixing a number or range of
           numbers with a caret (^).

           Packages that provide other packages are also handled. For example, pacman -S foo will first look for
           a foo package. If foo is not found, packages that provide the same functionality as foo will be
           searched for. If any package is found, it will be installed. A selection prompt is provided if
           multiple packages providing foo are found.

           You can also use pacman -Su to upgrade all packages that are out-of-date. See Sync Options below.
           When upgrading, pacman performs version comparison to determine which packages need upgrading. This
           behavior operates as follows:

               Alphanumeric:
                 1.0a &lt; 1.0b &lt; 1.0beta &lt; 1.0p &lt; 1.0pre &lt; 1.0rc &lt; 1.0 &lt; 1.0.a &lt; 1.0.1
               Numeric:
                 1 &lt; 1.0 &lt; 1.1 &lt; 1.1.1 &lt; 1.2 &lt; 2.0 &lt; 3.0.0

           Additionally, version strings can have an <u>epoch</u> value defined that will overrule any version
           comparison, unless the epoch values are equal. This is specified in an epoch:version-rel format. For
           example, 2:1.0-1 is always greater than 1:3.6-1.

       <b>-T,</b> <b>--deptest</b>
           Check dependencies; this is useful in scripts such as makepkg to check installed packages. This
           operation will check each dependency specified and return a list of dependencies that are not
           currently satisfied on the system. This operation accepts no other options. Example usage: pacman -T
           qt "bash&gt;=3.2".

       <b>-U,</b> <b>--upgrade</b>
           Upgrade or add package(s) to the system and install the required dependencies from sync repositories.
           Either a URL or file path can be specified. This is a “remove-then-add” process. See Upgrade Options
           below; also see Handling Config Files for an explanation on how pacman takes care of configuration
           files.

       <b>-F,</b> <b>--files</b>
           Query the files database. This operation allows you to look for packages owning certain files or
           display files owned by certain packages. Only packages that are part of your sync databases are
           searched. See File Options below.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
           Display version and exit.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
           Display syntax for the given operation. If no operation was supplied, then the general syntax is
           shown.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b,</b> <b>--dbpath</b> &lt;path&gt;
           Specify an alternative database location (the default is /var/lib/pacman). This should not be used
           unless you know what you are doing.  <b>NOTE</b>: If specified, this is an absolute path, and the root path
           is not automatically prepended.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--root</b> &lt;path&gt;
           Specify an alternative installation root (default is /). This should not be used as a way to install
           software into <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a> instead of /usr.  <b>NOTE</b>: If database path or log file are not specified on
           either the command line or in <b><a href="../man5/pacman.conf.5.html">pacman.conf</a></b>(5), their default location will be inside this root path.
           <b>NOTE</b>: This option is not suitable for performing operations on a mounted guest system. See <u>--sysroot</u>
           instead.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
           Output paths such as the Root, Conf File, DB Path, Cache Dirs, etc.

       <b>--arch</b> &lt;arch&gt;
           Specify an alternate architecture.

       <b>--cachedir</b> &lt;dir&gt;
           Specify an alternative package cache location (the default is /var/cache/pacman/pkg). Multiple cache
           directories can be specified, and they are tried in the order they are passed to pacman.  <b>NOTE</b>: This
           is an absolute path, and the root path is not automatically prepended.

       <b>--color</b> &lt;when&gt;
           Specify when to enable coloring. Valid options are <u>always</u>, <u>never</u>, or <u>auto</u>.  <u>always</u> forces colors on;
           <u>never</u> forces colors off; and <u>auto</u> only automatically enables colors when outputting onto a tty.

       <b>--config</b> &lt;file&gt;
           Specify an alternate configuration file.

       <b>--debug</b>
           Display debug messages. When reporting bugs, this option is recommended to be used.

       <b>--gpgdir</b> &lt;dir&gt;
           Specify a directory of files used by GnuPG to verify package signatures (the default is
           /etc/pacman.d/gnupg). This directory should contain two files: pubring.gpg and trustdb.gpg.
           pubring.gpg holds the public keys of all packagers.  trustdb.gpg contains a so-called trust database,
           which specifies that the keys are authentic and trusted.  <b>NOTE</b>: This is an absolute path, and the
           root path is not automatically prepended.

       <b>--hookdir</b> &lt;dir&gt;
           Specify a alternative directory containing hook files (the default is /etc/pacman.d/hooks). Multiple
           hook directories can be specified with hooks in later directories taking precedence over hooks in
           earlier directories.  <b>NOTE</b>: This is an absolute path, and the root path is not automatically
           prepended.

       <b>--logfile</b> &lt;file&gt;
           Specify an alternate log file. This is an absolute path, regardless of the installation root setting.

       <b>--noconfirm</b>
           Bypass any and all “Are you sure?” messages. It’s not a good idea to do this unless you want to run
           pacman from a script.

       <b>--confirm</b>
           Cancels the effects of a previous <u>--noconfirm</u>.

       <b>--disable-download-timeout</b>
           Disable defaults for low speed limit and timeout on downloads. Use this if you have issues
           downloading files with proxy and/or security gateway.

       <b>--sysroot</b> &lt;dir&gt;
           Specify an alternative system root. This path will be prepended to all other configuration
           directories and any repository servers beginning with file:/<a href="file:/.">/.</a> Any paths or URLs passed as targets
           will not be modified. This allows mounted guest systems to be properly operated on.

       <b>--disable-sandbox</b>
           Disable the default sandbox applied to the process downloading files on Linux systems. Useful if
           experiencing landlock related failures while downloading files when running a Linux kernel that does
           not support this feature.

</pre><h4><b>TRANSACTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>(APPLY</b> <b>TO</b> <b>-S,</b> <b>-R</b> <b>AND</b> <b>-U)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d,</b> <b>--nodeps</b>
           Skips dependency version checks. Package names are still checked. Normally, pacman will always check
           a package’s dependency fields to ensure that all dependencies are installed and there are no package
           conflicts in the system. Specify this option twice to skip all dependency checks.

       <b>--assume-installed</b> &lt;package=version&gt;
           Add a virtual package "package" with version "version" to the transaction to satisfy dependencies.
           This allows disabling the specific dependency checks without affecting all dependency checks. To
           disable all dependency checking, see the <u>--nodeps</u> option.

       <b>--dbonly</b>
           Adds/removes the database entry only, leaving all files in place.

       <b>--noprogressbar</b>
           Do not show a progress bar when downloading files. This can be useful for scripts that call pacman
           and capture the output.

       <b>--noscriptlet</b>
           If an install scriptlet exists, do not execute it. Do not use this unless you know what you are
           doing.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--print</b>
           Only print the targets instead of performing the actual operation (sync, remove or upgrade). Use
           <u>--print-format</u> to specify how targets are displayed. The default format string is "%l", which
           displays URLs with <u>-S</u>, file names with <u>-U</u>, and pkgname-pkgver with <u>-R</u>.

       <b>--print-format</b> &lt;format&gt;
           Specify a printf-like format to control the output of the <u>--print</u> operation. The possible attributes
           are: "%a" for arch, "%b" for builddate, "%d" for description, "%e" for pkgbase, "%f" for filename,
           "%g" for base64 encoded PGP signature, "%h" for sha256sum, "%m" for md5sum, "%n" for pkgname, "%p"
           for packager, "%v" for pkgver, "%l" for location, "%r" for repository, "%s" for size, "%C" for
           checkdepends, "%D" for depends, "%G" for groups, "%H" for conflicts, "%L" for licenses, "%M" for
           makedepends, "%O" for optional depends, "%P" for provides and "%R" for replaces. Implies <u>--print</u>.

</pre><h4><b>UPGRADE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>(APPLY</b> <b>TO</b> <b>-S</b> <b>AND</b> <b>-U)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-w,</b> <b>--downloadonly</b>
           Retrieve all packages from the server, but do not install/upgrade anything.

       <b>--asdeps</b>
           Install packages non-explicitly; in other words, fake their install reason to be installed as a
           dependency. This is useful for makepkg and other build-from-source tools that need to install
           dependencies before building the package.

       <b>--asexplicit</b>
           Install packages explicitly; in other words, fake their install reason to be explicitly installed.
           This is useful if you want to mark a dependency as explicitly installed so it will not be removed by
           the <u>--recursive</u> remove operation.

       <b>--ignore</b> &lt;package&gt;
           Directs pacman to ignore upgrades of package even if there is one available. Multiple packages can be
           specified by separating them with a comma.

       <b>--ignoregroup</b> &lt;group&gt;
           Directs pacman to ignore upgrades of all packages in <u>group</u>, even if there is one available. Multiple
           groups can be specified by separating them with a comma.

       <b>--needed</b>
           Do not reinstall the targets that are already up-to-date.

       <b>--overwrite</b> &lt;glob&gt;
           Bypass file conflict checks and overwrite conflicting files. If the package that is about to be
           installed contains files that are already installed and match <u>glob</u>, this option will cause all those
           files to be overwritten. Using <u>--overwrite</u> will not allow overwriting a directory with a file or
           installing packages with conflicting files and directories. Multiple patterns can be specified by
           separating them with a comma. May be specified multiple times. Patterns can be negated, such that
           files matching them will not be overwritten, by prefixing them with an exclamation mark. Subsequent
           matches will override previous ones. A leading literal exclamation mark or backslash needs to be
           escaped.

</pre><h4><b>QUERY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>(APPLY</b> <b>TO</b> <b>-Q)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c,</b> <b>--changelog</b>
           View the ChangeLog of a package if it exists.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--deps</b>
           Restrict or filter output to packages installed as dependencies. This option can be combined with <u>-t</u>
           for listing real orphans - packages that were installed as dependencies but are no longer required by
           any installed package.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--explicit</b>
           Restrict or filter output to explicitly installed packages. This option can be combined with <u>-t</u> to
           list explicitly installed packages that are not required by any other package.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--groups</b>
           Display all packages that are members of a named group. If a name is not specified, list all grouped
           packages.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--info</b>
           Display information on a given package. The <u>-p</u> option can be used if querying a package file instead
           of the local database. Passing two <u>--info</u> or <u>-i</u> flags will also display the list of backup files and
           their modification states.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--check</b>
           Check that all files owned by the given package(s) are present on the system. If packages are not
           specified or filter flags are not provided, check all installed packages. Specifying this option
           twice will perform more detailed file checking (including permissions, file sizes, and modification
           times) for packages that contain the needed mtree file.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--list</b>
           List all files owned by a given package. Multiple packages can be specified on the command line.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--foreign</b>
           Restrict or filter output to packages that were not found in the sync database(s). Typically these
           are packages that were downloaded manually and installed with <u>--upgrade</u>.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--native</b>
           Restrict or filter output to packages that are found in the sync database(s). This is the inverse
           filter of <u>--foreign</u>.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--owns</b> &lt;file&gt;
           Search for packages that own the specified file(s). The path can be relative or absolute, and one or
           more files can be specified.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--file</b>
           Signifies that the package supplied on the command line is a file and not an entry in the database.
           The file will be decompressed and queried. This is useful in combination with <u>--info</u> and <u>--list</u>.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
           Show less information for certain query operations. This is useful when pacman’s output is processed
           in a script. Search will only show package names and not version, group, and description information;
           owns will only show package names instead of "file is owned by pkg" messages; group will only show
           package names and omit group names; list will only show files and omit package names; check will only
           show pairs of package names and missing files; a bare query will only show package names rather than
           names and versions.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--search</b> &lt;regexp&gt;
           Search each locally-installed package for names or descriptions that match regexp. When including
           multiple search terms, only packages with descriptions matching ALL of those terms are returned.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--unrequired</b>
           Restrict or filter output to print only packages neither required nor optionally required by any
           currently installed package. Specify this option twice to include packages which are optionally, but
           not directly, required by another package.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--upgrades</b>
           Restrict or filter output to packages that are out-of-date on the local system. Only package versions
           are used to find outdated packages; replacements are not checked here. This option works best if the
           sync database is refreshed using <u>-Sy</u>.

</pre><h4><b>REMOVE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>(APPLY</b> <b>TO</b> <b>-R)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c,</b> <b>--cascade</b>
           Remove all target packages, as well as all packages that depend on one or more target packages. This
           operation is recursive and must be used with care, since it can remove many potentially needed
           packages.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--nosave</b>
           Instructs pacman to ignore file backup designations. Normally, when a file is removed from the
           system, the database is checked to see if the file should be renamed with a <u>.pacsave</u> extension.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--recursive</b>
           Remove each target specified including all of their dependencies, provided that (A) they are not
           required by other packages; and (B) they were not explicitly installed by the user. This operation is
           recursive and analogous to a backwards <u>--sync</u> operation, and it helps keep a clean system without
           orphans. If you want to omit condition (B), pass this option twice.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--unneeded</b>
           Removes targets that are not required by any other packages. This is mostly useful when removing a
           group without using the <u>-c</u> option, to avoid breaking any dependencies.

</pre><h4><b>SYNC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>(APPLY</b> <b>TO</b> <b>-S)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c,</b> <b>--clean</b>
           Remove packages that are no longer installed from the cache as well as currently unused sync
           databases to free up disk space. When pacman downloads packages, it saves them in a cache directory.
           In addition, databases are saved for every sync DB you download from and are not deleted even if they
           are removed from the configuration file <b><a href="../man5/pacman.conf.5.html">pacman.conf</a></b>(5). Use one <u>--clean</u> switch to only remove
           packages that are no longer installed; use two to remove all files from the cache. In both cases, you
           will have a yes or no option to remove packages and/or unused downloaded databases.

           If you use a network shared cache, see the <u>CleanMethod</u> option in <b><a href="../man5/pacman.conf.5.html">pacman.conf</a></b>(5).

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--groups</b>
           Display all the members for each package group specified. If no group names are provided, all groups
           will be listed; pass the flag twice to view all groups and their members.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--info</b>
           Display information on a given sync database package. Passing two <u>--info</u> or <u>-i</u> flags will also
           display those packages in all repositories that depend on this package.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--list</b>
           List all packages in the specified repositories. Multiple repositories can be specified on the
           command line.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
           Show less information for certain sync operations. This is useful when pacman’s output is processed
           in a script. Search will only show package names and not repository, version, group, and description
           information; list will only show package names and omit databases and versions; group will only show
           package names and omit group names.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--search</b> &lt;regexp&gt;
           This will search each package in the sync databases for names or descriptions that match regexp. When
           you include multiple search terms, only packages with descriptions matching ALL of those terms will
           be returned.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--sysupgrade</b>
           Upgrades all packages that are out-of-date. Each currently-installed package will be examined and
           upgraded if a newer package exists. A report of all packages to upgrade will be presented, and the
           operation will not proceed without user confirmation. Dependencies are automatically resolved at this
           level and will be installed/upgraded if necessary.

           Pass this option twice to enable package downgrades; in this case, pacman will select sync packages
           whose versions do not match with the local versions. This can be useful when the user switches from a
           testing repository to a stable one.

           Additional targets can also be specified manually, so that <u>-Su</u> <u>foo</u> will do a system upgrade and
           install/upgrade the "foo" package in the same operation.

       <b>-y,</b> <b>--refresh</b>
           Download a fresh copy of the master package databases <u>(repo.db)</u> from the server(s) defined in
           <b><a href="../man5/pacman.conf.5.html">pacman.conf</a></b>(5). This should typically be used each time you use <u>--sysupgrade</u> or <u>-u</u>. Passing two
           <u>--refresh</u> or <u>-y</u> flags will force a refresh of all package databases, even if they appear to be
           up-to-date.

</pre><h4><b>DATABASE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>(APPLY</b> <b>TO</b> <b>-D)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--asdeps</b> &lt;package&gt;
           Mark a package as non-explicitly installed; in other words, set their install reason to be installed
           as a dependency.

       <b>--asexplicit</b> &lt;package&gt;
           Mark a package as explicitly installed; in other words, set their install reason to be explicitly
           installed. This is useful if you want to keep a package installed even when it was initially
           installed as a dependency of another package.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--check</b>
           Check the local package database is internally consistent. This will check all required files are
           present and that installed packages have the required dependencies, do not conflict and that multiple
           packages do not own the same file. Specifying this option twice will perform a check on the sync
           databases to ensure all specified dependencies are available.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
           Suppress messages on successful completion of database operations.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>(APPLY</b> <b>TO</b> <b>-F)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-y,</b> <b>--refresh</b>
           Download fresh package file databases <u>(repo.files)</u> from the server. Use twice to force a refresh even
           if databases are up to date.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--list</b>
           List the files owned by the queried package.

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--regex</b>
           Interpret each query as a regular expression.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
           Show less information for certain file operations. This is useful when pacman’s output is processed
           in a script, however, you may want to use <u>--machinereadable</u> instead.

       <b>--machinereadable</b>
           Print each match in a machine readable output format. The format is
           <u>repository\0pkgname\0pkgver\0path\n</u> with <u>\0</u> being the NULL character and <u>\n</u> a linefeed.

</pre><h4><b>HANDLING</b> <b>CONFIG</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Pacman uses the same logic as <u>rpm</u> to determine action against files that are designated to be backed up.
       During an upgrade, three MD5 hashes are used for each backup file to determine the required action: one
       for the original file installed, one for the new file that is about to be installed, and one for the
       actual file existing on the file system. After comparing these three hashes, the following scenarios can
       result:

       original=X, current=X, new=X
           All three files are the same, so overwrites are not an issue. Install the new file.

       original=X, current=X, new=Y
           The current file is the same as the original, but the new one differs. Since the user did not ever
           modify the file, and the new one may contain improvements or bug fixes, install the new file.

       original=X, current=Y, new=X
           Both package versions contain the exact same file, but the one on the file system has been modified.
           Leave the current file in place.

       original=X, current=Y, new=Y
           The new file is identical to the current file. Install the new file.

       original=X, current=Y, new=Z
           All three files are different, so install the new file with a <u>.pacnew</u> extension and warn the user.
           The user must then manually merge any necessary changes into the original file.

       original=NULL, current=Y, new=Z
           The package was not previously installed, and the file already exists on the file system. Install the
           new file with a <u>.pacnew</u> extension and warn the user. The user must then manually merge any necessary
           changes into the original file.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       pacman -Ss ne.hack
           Search for regexp "ne.hack" in package database.

       pacman -S gpm
           Download and install gpm including dependencies.

       pacman -U /home/user/ceofhack-0.6-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.gz
           Install ceofhack-0.6-1 package from a local file.

       pacman -Syu
           Update package list and upgrade all packages afterwards.

       pacman -Syu gpm
           Update package list, upgrade all packages, and then install gpm if it wasn’t already installed.
