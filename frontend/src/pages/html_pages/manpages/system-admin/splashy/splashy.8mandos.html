</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       splashy - Mandos plugin to use splashy to get a password.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>splashy</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program prompts for a password using <b><a href="../man8/splashy_update.8.html">splashy_update</a></b>(8) and outputs any given password to standard
       output. If no <b><a href="../man8/splashy.8.html">splashy</a></b>(8) process can be found, this program will immediately exit with an exit code
       indicating failure.

       This program is not very useful on its own. This program is really meant to run as a plugin in the Mandos
       client-side system, where it is used as a fallback and alternative to retrieving passwords from a Mandos
       server.

       If this program is killed (presumably by <b><a href="../man8mandos/plugin-runner.8mandos.html">plugin-runner</a></b>(8mandos) because some other plugin provided the
       password), it cannot tell <b><a href="../man8/splashy.8.html">splashy</a></b>(8) to abort requesting a password, because <b><a href="../man8/splashy.8.html">splashy</a></b>(8) does not support
       this. Therefore, this program will then <u>kill</u> the running <b><a href="../man8/splashy.8.html">splashy</a></b>(8) process and start a <u>new</u> one, using
       “boot” as the only argument.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This program takes no options.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       If exit status is 0, the output from the program is the password as it was read. Otherwise, if exit
       status is other than 0, the program was interrupted or encountered an error, and any output so far could
       be corrupt and/or truncated, and should therefore be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cryptsource</b>, <b>crypttarget</b>
           If set, these environment variables will be assumed to contain the source device name and the target
           device mapper name, respectively, and will be shown as part of the prompt.

           These variables will normally be inherited from <b><a href="../man8mandos/plugin-runner.8mandos.html">plugin-runner</a></b>(8mandos), which might have in turn
           inherited them from its calling process.

           This behavior is meant to exactly mirror the behavior of <b>askpass</b>, the default password prompter.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /sbin/splashy_update
           This is the command run to retrieve a password from <b><a href="../man8/splashy.8.html">splashy</a></b>(8). See <b><a href="../man8/splashy_update.8.html">splashy_update</a></b>(8).

       <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a>
           To find the running <b><a href="../man8/splashy.8.html">splashy</a></b>(8), this directory will be searched for numeric entries which will be
           assumed to be directories. In all those directories, the exe entry will be used to determine the name
           of the running binary and the effective user and group ID of the process. See <b><a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</a></b>(5).

       /sbin/splashy
           This is the name of the binary which will be searched for in the process list. See <b><a href="../man8/splashy.8.html">splashy</a></b>(8).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Killing <b><a href="../man8/splashy.8.html">splashy</a></b>(8) and starting a new one is ugly, but necessary as long as it does not support aborting
       a password request.

       Please report bugs to the Mandos development mailing list: &lt;<a href="mailto:mandos-dev@recompile.se">mandos-dev@recompile.se</a>&gt; (subscription
       required). Note that this list is public. The developers can be reached privately at
       &lt;<a href="mailto:mandos@recompile.se">mandos@recompile.se</a>&gt; (OpenPGP key fingerprint 153A 37F1 0BBA 0435 987F 2C4A 7223 2973 CA34 C2C4 for
       encrypted mail).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Note that normally, this program will not be invoked directly, but instead started by the Mandos <b><a href="../man8mandos/pluginrunner.8mandos.html">plugin-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man8mandos/pluginrunner.8mandos.html">runner</a></b>(8mandos).

       This program takes no options.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       If this program is killed by a signal, it will kill the process ID which at the start of this program was
       determined to run <b><a href="../man8/splashy.8.html">splashy</a></b>(8) as root (see also the section called “FILES”). There is a very slight risk
       that, in the time between those events, that process ID was freed and then taken up by another process;
       the wrong process would then be killed. Now, this program can only be killed by the user who started it;
       see <b><a href="../man8mandos/plugin-runner.8mandos.html">plugin-runner</a></b>(8mandos). This program should therefore be started by a completely separate
       non-privileged user, and no other programs should be allowed to run as that special user. This means that
       it is not recommended to use the user "nobody" to start this program, as other possibly less trusted
       programs could be running as "nobody", and they would then be able to kill this program, triggering the
       killing of the process ID which may or may not be <b><a href="../man8/splashy.8.html">splashy</a></b>(8).

       The only other thing that could be considered worthy of note is this: This program is meant to be run by
       <b><a href="../man8mandos/plugin-runner.8mandos.html">plugin-runner</a></b>(8mandos), and will, when run standalone, outside, in a normal environment, immediately
       output on its standard output any presumably secret password it just received. Therefore, when running
       this program standalone (which should never normally be done), take care not to type in any real secret
       password by force of habit, since it would then immediately be shown as output.
