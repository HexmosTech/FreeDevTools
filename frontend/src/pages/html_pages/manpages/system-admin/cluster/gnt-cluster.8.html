</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       gnt-cluster - Ganeti administration, cluster-wide

</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gnt-cluster</b> {command} [arguments...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>gnt-cluster</b> is used for cluster-wide administration in the Ganeti system.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ACTIVATE-MASTER-IP</b>
       <b>activate-master-ip</b>

       Activates the master IP on the master node.

   <b>COMMAND</b>
       <b>command</b> [-n <u>node-name</u>] [-g <u>group</u>] [-M] {<u>command</u>}

       Executes  a command on all nodes.  This command is designed for simple usage.  For more complex use cases
       the commands <b><a href="../man1/dsh.1.html">dsh</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/cssh.1.html">cssh</a></b>(1) should be used instead.

       If the option -n is not given, the command will be executed on all nodes, otherwise it will  be  executed
       only on the node(s) specified.  Use the option multiple times for running it on multiple nodes, like:

              # gnt-cluster command -n node1.example.com -n node2.example.com date

       The -g option can be used to run a command only on a specific node group, e.g.:

              # gnt-cluster command -g default date

       The  -M option can be used to prepend the node name to all output lines.  The --failure-only option hides
       successful commands, making it easier to see failures.

       The command is executed serially on the selected nodes.  If the master node is present in the  list,  the
       command  will be executed last on the master.  Regarding the other nodes, the execution order is somewhat
       alphabetic,  so  that   node2.example.com   will   be   earlier   than   node10.example.com   but   after
       node1.example.com.

       So  given the node names node1, node2, node3, node10, node11, with node3 being the master, the order will
       be: node1, node2, node10, node11, node3.

       The command is constructed by concatenating all other command line arguments.  For example, to  list  the
       contents of the <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a> directory on all nodes, run:

              # gnt-cluster command ls -l <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>

       and the command which will be executed will be ls -l /etc.

   <b>COPYFILE</b>
       <b>copyfile</b> [--use-replication-network] [-n <u>node-name</u>] [-g <u>group</u>]
       {<u>file</u>}

       Copies  a  file to all or to some nodes.  The argument specifies the source file (on the current system),
       the -n argument specifies the target node, or nodes if the option is given multiple times.  If -n is  not
       given  at all, the file will be copied to all nodes.  The -g option can be used to only select nodes in a
       specific node group.  Passing the --use-replication-network option will cause the copy to  be  done  over
       the replication network (only matters if the primary/secondary IPs are different).  Example:

              # gnt-cluster copyfile -n node1.example.com -n node2.example.com /tmp/test

       This will copy the file /tmp/test from the current node to the two named nodes.

   <b>DEACTIVATE-MASTER-IP</b>
       <b>deactivate-master-ip</b> [--yes]

       Deactivates the master IP on the master node.

       This should be run only locally or on a connection to the node ip directly, as a connection to the master
       ip  will  be broken by this operation.  Because of this risk it will require user confirmation unless the
       --yes option is passed.

   <b>DESTROY</b>
       <b>destroy</b> {--yes-do-it}

       Remove all configuration files related to the cluster, so that a  <b>gnt-cluster</b>  <b>init</b>  can  be  done  again
       afterwards.

       Since this is a dangerous command, you are required to pass the argument <u>--yes-do-it.</u>

   <b>EPO</b>
       <b>epo</b> [--on] [--groups|--all] [--power-delay] <u>arguments</u>

       Performs  an  emergency  power-off on nodes given as arguments.  If --groups is given, arguments are node
       groups.  If --all is provided, the whole cluster will be shut down.

       The --on flag recovers the cluster after an emergency power-off.  When powering on the  cluster  you  can
       use --power-delay to define the time in seconds (fractions allowed) waited between powering on individual
       nodes.

       Please  note that the master node will not be turned down or up automatically.  It will just be left in a
       state, where you can manually perform the shutdown of that one node.  If the master is  in  the  list  of
       affected  nodes  and  this  is  not  a  complete  cluster emergency power-off (e.g.  using --all), you're
       required to do a master failover to another node not affected.

   <b>GETMASTER</b>
       <b>getmaster</b>

       Displays the current master node.

   <b>INFO</b>
       <b>info</b> [--roman]

       Shows runtime cluster information: cluster name, architecture (32 or 64 bit), master node, node list  and
       instance list.

       Passing the --roman option gnt-cluster info will try to print its integer fields in a latin friendly way.
       This allows further diffusion of Ganeti among ancient cultures.

   <b>SHOW-ISPECS-CMD</b>
       <b>show-ispecs-cmd</b>

       Shows  the  command line that can be used to recreate the cluster with the same options relative to specs
       in the instance policies.

       {<u>cluster-name</u>}

       This commands is only run once initially on the first node  of  the  cluster.   It  will  initialize  the
       cluster configuration, setup the ssh-keys, start the daemons on the master node, etc.  in order to have a
       working one-node cluster.

       Note  that  the <u>cluster-name</u> is not any random name.  It has to be resolvable to an IP address using DNS,
       and it is best if you give the fully-qualified domain name.  This hostname must resolve to an IP  address
       reserved exclusively for this purpose, i.e.  not already in use.

       The cluster can run in two modes: single-home or dual-homed.  In the first case, all traffic (both public
       traffic,  inter-node  traffic  and  data  replication  traffic)  goes  over  the  same interface.  In the
       dual-homed case, the data replication traffic goes over the  second  network.   The  -s  (--secondary-ip)
       option  here  marks  the  cluster  as  dual-homed and its parameter represents this node's address on the
       second network.  If you initialise the cluster with -s, all nodes added must have a secondary IP as well.

       Note that for Ganeti it doesn't matter if the secondary network is actually a separate physical  network,
       or  is  done using tunnelling, etc.  For performance reasons, it's recommended to use a separate network,
       of course.

       The --vg-name option will let you specify a volume group different than "xenvg" for Ganeti  to  use  when
       creating  instance  disks.   This volume group must have the same name on all nodes.  Once the cluster is
       initialized this can be altered by using the <b>modify</b> command.  Note that  if  the  volume  group  name  is
       modified  after  the  cluster  creation and DRBD support is enabled you might have to manually modify the
       metavg as well.

       If you don't want to use lvm storage at all use the --enabled-disk-templates option to restrict  the  set
       of  enabled  disk  templates.   Once the cluster is initialized you can change this setup with the <b>modify</b>
       command.

       The --master-netdev option is useful for specifying a  different  interface  on  which  the  master  will
       activate  its IP address.  It's important that all nodes have this interface because you'll need it for a
       master failover.

       The --master-netmask option allows to specify a netmask for the master IP.  The netmask must be specified
       as an integer, and will be interpreted as a CIDR netmask.  The default value is 32 for  an  IPv4  address
       and 128 for an IPv6 address.

       The  --use-external-mip-script option allows to specify whether to use an user-supplied master IP address
       setup script, whose location is /etc/ganeti/scripts/master-ip-setup.  If  the  option  value  is  set  to
       False, the default script (located at /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/master-ip-setup) will be executed.

       The  -m  (--mac-prefix)  option  will  let  you  specify  a three byte prefix under which the virtual MAC
       addresses of your instances will be generated.  The prefix must be specified in the format  XX:XX:XX  and
       the default is aa:00:00.

       The --no-etc-hosts option allows you to initialize the cluster without modifying the <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> file.

       The  --no-ssh-init  option  allows you to initialize the cluster without creating or distributing SSH key
       pairs.  This also sets the cluster-wide configuration parameter modify ssh setup to False.   When  adding
       nodes, Ganeti will consider this parameter to determine whether to create and distribute SSH key pairs on
       new nodes as well.

       The  --file-storage-dir,  --shared-file-storage-dir  and  --gluster-storage-dir options allow you set the
       directory to use for storing the instance disk files when using respectively the  file  storage  backend,
       the  shared file storage backend and the gluster storage backend.  Note that these directories must be an
       allowed    directory    for    file    storage.     Those    directories    are    specified    in    the
       /etc/ganeti/file-storage-paths file.  The file storage directory can also be a subdirectory of an allowed
       one.  The file storage directory should be present on all nodes.

       The  --prealloc-wipe-disks  sets  a cluster wide configuration value for wiping disks prior to allocation
       and size changes (gnt-instance grow-disk).  This increases security on instance  level  as  the  instance
       can't access untouched data from its underlying storage.

       The  --enabled-hypervisors option allows you to set the list of hypervisors that will be enabled for this
       cluster.  Instance hypervisors can only be chosen from the list of enabled  hypervisors,  and  the  first
       entry of this list will be used by default.  Currently, the following hypervisors are available:

       xen-pvm
              Xen PVM hypervisor

       xen-hvm
              Xen HVM hypervisor

       kvm    Linux KVM hypervisor

       chroot a simple chroot manager that starts chroot based on a script at the root of the filesystem holding
              the chroot

       fake   fake hypervisor for development/testing

       Either  a single hypervisor name or a comma-separated list of hypervisor names can be specified.  If this
       option is not specified, only the xen-pvm hypervisor is enabled by default.

       The --user-shutdown option enables or disables user  shutdown  detection  at  the  cluster  level.   User
       shutdown  detection  allows users to initiate instance poweroff from inside the instance, and Ganeti will
       report the instance status as 'USER_down' (as opposed, to 'ERROR_down') and the watcher will not  restart
       these  instances,  thus  preserving their instance status.  This option is disabled by default.  For KVM,
       the hypervisor parameter user_shutdown must also be set, either at the cluster level or on a per-instance
       basis (see <b><a href="../man8/gnt-instance.8.html">gnt-instance</a></b>(8)).

       The -H (--hypervisor-parameters) option allows you to set default hypervisor specific parameters for  the
       cluster.   The  format  of  this  option  is  the  name  of  the  hypervisor,  followed  by a colon and a
       comma-separated list of key=value pairs.  The keys available for each hypervisors  are  detailed  in  the
       <b><a href="../man8/gnt-instance.8.html">gnt-instance</a></b>(8)  man  page,  in the <b>add</b> command plus the following parameters which are only configurable
       globally (at cluster level):

       migration_port
              Valid for the Xen PVM and KVM hypervisors.

       migration_bandwidth
              Valid for the KVM hypervisor.

              This option specifies the maximum bandwidth that KVM will use for instance live  migrations.   The
              value is in MiB/s.

              This option is only effective with kvm versions &gt;= 78 and qemu-kvm versions &gt;= 0.10.0.

       The  -B  (--backend-parameters)  option allows you to set the default backend parameters for the cluster.
       The parameter format is a comma-separated list of key=value pairs with the following supported keys:

       vcpus  Number of VCPUs to set for an instance by default, must be an integer, will be  set  to  1  if  no
              specified.

       maxmem Maximum  amount  of  memory to allocate for an instance by default, can be either an integer or an
              integer followed by a unit (M for mebibytes and G for gibibytes are supported),  will  be  set  to
              128M if not specified.

       minmem Minimum  amount  of  memory to allocate for an instance by default, can be either an integer or an
              integer followed by a unit (M for mebibytes and G for gibibytes are supported),  will  be  set  to
              128M if not specified.

       auto_balance
              Value  of  the  auto_balance  flag  for  instances  to  use by default, will be set to true if not
              specified.

       always_failover
              Default value for the always_failover flag for instances; if not set, False is used.

       The -N (--nic-parameters) option allows you to set the  default  network  interface  parameters  for  the
       cluster.   The parameter format is a comma-separated list of key=value pairs with the following supported
       keys:

       mode   The default NIC mode, one of routed, bridged or openvswitch.

       link   In bridged or openvswitch mode the default interface where to attach  NICs.   In  routed  mode  it
              represents  an  hypervisor-vif-script  dependent  value  to  allow different instance groups.  For
              example under the KVM default network script it is interpreted as a routing table number or  name.
              Openvswitch  support  is also hypervisor dependent and currently works for the default KVM network
              script.  Under Xen a custom network script must be provided.

       The -D (--disk-parameters) option allows you to set the  default  disk  template  parameters  at  cluster
       level.   The  format  used  for this option is similar to the one use by the -H option: the disk template
       name must be specified first, followed by a colon and by  a  comma-separated  list  of  key-value  pairs.
       These  parameters  can only be specified at cluster and node group level; the cluster-level parameter are
       inherited by the node group at the moment of its creation, and can be  further  modified  at  node  group
       level using the <b><a href="../man8/gnt-group.8.html">gnt-group</a></b>(8) command.

       The  following  is  the  list  of disk parameters available for the <b>drbd</b> template, with measurement units
       specified in square brackets at the end of the description (when applicable):

       resync-rate
              Static re-synchronization rate.  [KiB/s]

       data-stripes
              Number of stripes to use for data LVs.

       meta-stripes
              Number of stripes to use for meta LVs.

       disk-barriers
              What kind of barriers to <b>disable</b> for disks.  It can  either  assume  the  value  "n",  meaning  no
              barrier  disabled,  or  a non-empty string containing a subset of the characters "bfd".  "b" means
              disable disk barriers, "f" means disable disk flushes, "d" disables disk drains.

       meta-barriers
              Boolean value indicating whether the meta barriers should be disabled (True) or not (False).

       metavg String containing the name of the default LVM volume group for DRBD metadata.  By default,  it  is
              set  to  xenvg.  It can be overridden during the instance creation process by using the metavg key
              of the --disk parameter.

       disk-custom
              String containing additional parameters to be appended to the arguments list of drbdsetup disk.

       net-custom
              String containing additional parameters to be appended to the arguments list of drbdsetup net.

       protocol
              Replication protocol for the DRBD device.  Has to be either "A", "B" or "C".  Refer  to  the  DRBD
              documentation for further information about the differences between the protocols.

       dynamic-resync
              Boolean  indicating  whether  to  use  the  dynamic  resync  speed controller or not.  If enabled,
              c-plan-ahead must be non-zero and all the c-* parameters will be used  by  DRBD.   Otherwise,  the
              value of resync-rate will be used as a static resync speed.

       c-plan-ahead
              Agility factor of the dynamic resync speed controller.  (the higher, the slower the algorithm will
              adapt the resync speed).  A value of 0 (that is the default) disables the controller.  [ds]

       c-fill-target
              Maximum amount of in-flight resync data for the dynamic resync speed controller.  [sectors]

       c-delay-target
              Maximum estimated peer response latency for the dynamic resync speed controller.  [ds]

       c-min-rate
              Minimum resync speed for the dynamic resync speed controller.  [KiB/s]

       c-max-rate
              Upper bound on resync speed for the dynamic resync speed controller.  [KiB/s]

       List of parameters available for the <b>plain</b> template:

       stripes
              Number of stripes to use for new LVs.

       List of parameters available for the <b>rbd</b> template:

       pool   The  RADOS  cluster  pool,  inside which all rbd volumes will reside.  When a new RADOS cluster is
              deployed, the default pool to put rbd volumes (Images in RADOS terminology) is 'rbd'.

       access If 'userspace', instances will access their disks directly without going through a  block  device,
              avoiding  expensive  context  switches  with  kernel  space and the potential for deadlocks in low
              memory scenarios.

              The default value is 'kernelspace' and it disables this  behaviour.   This  setting  may  only  be
              changed  to  'userspace' if all instance disks in the affected group or cluster can be accessed in
              userspace.

              Attempts to use this feature without rbd support compiled in KVM result in  a  "no  such  file  or
              directory" error messages.

       The  option  --maintain-node-health  allows one to enable/disable automatic maintenance actions on nodes.
       Currently these include automatic shutdown of instances and  deactivation  of  DRBD  devices  on  offline
       nodes;  in  the  future it might be extended to automatic removal of unknown LVM volumes, etc.  Note that
       this option is only useful if the use of ganeti-confd was enabled at compilation.

       The --uid-pool option initializes the user-id pool.  The <u>user-id</u> <u>pool</u> <u>definition</u> can contain  a  list  of
       user-ids  and/or  a  list  of  user-id ranges.  The parameter format is a comma-separated list of numeric
       user-ids or user-id ranges.  The ranges are defined by a lower and higher boundary, separated by a  dash.
       The  boundaries are inclusive.  If the --uid-pool option is not supplied, the user-id pool is initialized
       to an empty list.  An empty list means that the user-id pool feature is disabled.

       The -I (--default-iallocator) option specifies the default instance allocator.   The  instance  allocator
       will  be  used  for  operations like instance creation, instance and node migration, etc.  when no manual
       override is specified.  If this option is not specified and htools was not enabled  at  build  time,  the
       default  instance  allocator  will  be  blank,  which  means  that  relevant  operations will require the
       administrator to manually specify either an instance allocator, or a set of nodes.  If the option is  not
       specified  but  htools  was  enabled, the default iallocator will be <b><a href="../man1/hail.1.html">hail</a></b>(1) (assuming it can be found on
       disk).  The default iallocator can be changed later using the <b>modify</b> command.

       The option --default-iallocator-params sets the cluster-wide iallocator parameters used  by  the  default
       iallocator only on instance allocations.

       The  --primary-ip-version  option specifies the IP version used for the primary address.  Possible values
       are 4 and 6 for IPv4 and IPv6, respectively.  This option is used  when  resolving  node  names  and  the
       cluster name.

       The  --node-parameters  option  allows  you  to  set default node parameters for the cluster.  Please see
       <b><a href="../man7/ganeti.7.html">ganeti</a></b>(7) for more information about supported key=value pairs.

       The -C (--candidate-pool-size) option specifies the candidate_pool_size cluster parameter.  This  is  the
       number  of nodes that the master will try to keep as master_candidates.  For more details about this role
       and other node roles, see the <b><a href="../man7/ganeti.7.html">ganeti</a></b>(7).

       The  --specs-...  and  --ipolicy-...  options  specify  the  instance  policy  on   the   cluster.    The
       --ipolicy-bounds-specs  option sets the minimum and maximum specifications for instances.  The format is:
       min:<u>param</u>=*value*,.../max:<u>param</u>=*value*,...  and further specifications pairs can be added by using // as
       a separator.  The --ipolicy-std-specs option takes a list of parameter/value pairs.   For  both  options,
       <u>param</u> can be:

       • cpu-count: number of VCPUs for an instance

       • disk-count: number of disk for an instance

       • disk-size: size of each disk

       • memory-size: instance memory

       • nic-count: number of network interface

       • spindle-use: spindle usage for an instance

       For  the  --specs-...  options,  each  option  can have three values: min, max and std, which can also be
       modified on group level (except for std, which is defined once for the  entire  cluster).   Please  note,
       that  std  values  are  not  the  same  as defaults set by --beparams, but they are used for the capacity
       calculations.

       • --specs-cpu-count limits the number of VCPUs that can be used by an instance.

       • --specs-disk-count limits the number of disks

       • --specs-disk-size limits the disk size for every disk used

       • --specs-mem-size limits the amount of memory available

       • --specs-nic-count sets limits on the number of NICs used

       The --ipolicy-spindle-ratio option takes a decimal number.  The --ipolicy-disk-templates option  takes  a
       comma-separated  list  of  disk  templates.   This list of disk templates must be a subset of the list of
       cluster-wide enabled disk templates (which can be set with --enabled-disk-templates).

       • --ipolicy-spindle-ratio limits the instances-spindles ratio

       • --ipolicy-vcpu-ratio limits the vcpu-cpu ratio

       All the instance policy elements can be overridden at group level.  Group level overrides can be  removed
       by specifying default as the value of an item.

       The  --drbd-usermode-helper  option  can be used to specify a usermode helper.  Check that this string is
       the one used by the DRBD kernel.

       For details about how to use --hypervisor-state and --disk-state have a look at <b><a href="../man7/ganeti.7.html">ganeti</a></b>(7).

       The --enabled-disk-templates option specifies a list of disk templates that can be used by  instances  of
       the  cluster.   For  the possible values in this list, see <b><a href="../man8/gnt-instance.8.html">gnt-instance</a></b>(8).  Note that in contrast to the
       list of disk templates in the ipolicy, this list is a hard restriction.  It is  not  possible  to  create
       instances  with disk templates that are not enabled in the cluster.  It is also not possible to disable a
       disk template when there are still instances using it.  The first disk template in the  list  of  enabled
       disk  template  is the default disk template.  It will be used for instance creation, if no disk template
       is requested explicitly.

       The --install-image option specifies the location of the OS image to use to run the OS scripts  inside  a
       virtualized  environment.  This can be a file path or a URL.  In the case that a file path is used, nodes
       are expected to have the install image located at the given path, although  that  is  enforced  during  a
       instance create with unsafe OS scripts operation only.

       The --zeroing-image option specifies the location of the OS image to use to zero out the free space of an
       instance.  This can be a file path or a URL.  In the case that a file path is used, nodes are expected to
       have  the  zeroing  image located at the given path, although that is enforced during a zeroing operation
       only.

       The --compression-tools option specifies the tools that  can  be  used  to  compress  the  disk  data  of
       instances  in  transfer.  The default tools are: 'gzip', 'gzip-slow', and 'gzip-fast'.  For compatibility
       reasons, the 'gzip' tool cannot be excluded from the list of compression tools.  Ganeti knows how to  use
       certain  tools,  but  does not provide them as a default as they are not commonly present: currently only
       'lzop'.  The user should indicate their presence by specifying  them  through  this  option.   Any  other
       custom  tool  specified must have a simple executable name ('[-_a-zA-Z0-9]+'), accept input on stdin, and
       produce output on stdout.  The '-d' flag specifies that decompression rather than compression  is  taking
       place.   The  '-h'  flag  must  be  supported as a means of testing whether the executable exists.  These
       requirements are compatible with the gzip command line options, allowing many tools to be easily  wrapped
       and used.

       The  --ssh-key-type  and --ssh-key-bits options determine the properties of the SSH keys Ganeti generates
       and uses to execute commands on nodes.  The supported types are currently 'dsa', 'rsa', and 'ecdsa'.  The
       supported bit sizes vary across keys, reflecting the options <b><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></b>(1) exposes.  These are currently:

       • dsa: 1024 bits

       • rsa: &gt;=768 bits

       • ecdsa: 256, 384, or 521 bits

       Ganeti defaults to using 2048-bit RSA keys.

   <b>MASTER-FAILOVER</b>
       <b>master-failover</b> [--no-voting] [--yes-do-it]
       [--ignore-offline-nodes]

       Failover the master role to the current node.

       The --no-voting option skips the remote node agreement checks.  This is dangerous, but necessary in  some
       cases  (for  example failing over the master role in a 2 node cluster with the original master down).  If
       the original master then comes up, it won't be able to start its master  daemon  because  it  won't  have
       enough  votes,  but  so  won't  the  new master, if the master daemon ever needs a restart.  You can pass
       --no-voting to <b>ganeti-luxid</b> and  <b>ganeti-wconfd</b>  on  the  new  master  to  solve  this  problem,  and  run
       <b>gnt-cluster</b> <b>redist-conf</b> to make sure the cluster is consistent again.

       The  option  --yes-do-it is used together with --no-voting, for skipping the interactive checks.  This is
       even more dangerous, and should only be used in conjunction with  other  means  (e.g.   a  HA  suite)  to
       confirm that the operation is indeed safe.

       Note that in order for remote node agreement checks to work, a strict majority of nodes still needs to be
       functional.   To avoid situations with daemons not starting up on the new master, master-failover without
       the --no-voting option verifies a healthy majority of nodes and refuses the operation otherwise.

       The --ignore-offline-nodes flag ignores offline nodes when the cluster is  voting  on  the  master.   Any
       nodes  that  are  offline  are  not  counted towards the vote or towards the healthy nodes required for a
       majority, as they will be brought into sync with the rest of the cluster during a node readd operation.

   <b>MASTER-PING</b>
       <b>master-ping</b>

       Checks if the master daemon is alive.

       If the master daemon is alive and can respond to a basic query (the equivalent of <b>gnt-cluster</b> <b>info</b>), then
       the exit code of the command will be 0.  If the master daemon is not alive (either  due  to  a  crash  or
       because this is not the master node), the exit code will be 1.

       --compression-tools,   and   --enabled-disk-templates   options   are  described  in  the  <b>init</b>  command.
       --master-netdev, --master-netmask, --use-external-mip-script, --drbd-usermode-helper, --file-storage-dir,
       --shared-file-storage-dir, --enabled-disk-templates, and --user-shutdown options  are  described  in  the
       <b>init</b> command.

       The --modify-etc-hosts option is described by --no-etc-hosts in the <b>init</b> command.

       The --hypervisor-state and --disk-state options are described in detail in <b><a href="../man7/ganeti.7.html">ganeti</a></b>(7).

       The  --max-running-jobs  options  allows to set limit on the number of jobs in non-finished jobs that are
       not queued, i.e., the number of jobs that are  in  waiting  or  running  state.   The  --max-tracked-jobs
       options  allows  to  set  the limit on the tracked jobs.  Normally, Ganeti will watch waiting and running
       jobs by tracking their job file with inotify.  If this limit is exceeded, however, Ganeti will  back  off
       and only periodically pull for updates.

       The --add-uids and --remove-uids options can be used to modify the user-id pool by adding/removing a list
       of user-ids or user-id ranges.

       The  option  --reserved-lvs  specifies  a  list  (comma-separated) of logical volume group names (regular
       expressions) that will be ignored by the cluster verify operation.  This is useful if  the  volume  group
       used  for  Ganeti is shared with the system for other uses.  Note that it's not recommended to create and
       mark as ignored logical volume names which match Ganeti's own name format (starting with  UUID  and  then
       .diskN), as this option only skips the verification, but not the actual use of the names given.

       To remove all reserved logical volumes, pass in an empty argument to the option, as in --reserved-lvs= or
       --reserved-lvs ''.

       The  -I  (--default-iallocator)  is described in the <b>init</b> command.  To clear the default iallocator, just
       pass an empty string ('').

       The option --default-iallocator-params is described in the <b>init</b> command.  To clear the default iallocator
       parameters, just pass an empty string ('').

       The --ipolicy-... options are described in the <b>init</b> command.

       The --instance-communication-network enables instance communication by specifying the name of the  Ganeti
       network  that  should be used for instance communication.  If the supplied network does not exist, Ganeti
       will create a new network with the supplied name with the default parameters for instance  communication.
       If  the  supplied network exists, Ganeti will check its parameters and warn about unusual configurations,
       but it will still use that network for instance communication.

       The --enabled-data-collectors and --data-collector-interval options are to control the  behavior  of  the
       <b><a href="../man8/ganeti-mond.8.html">ganeti-mond</a></b>(8).   The  first  expects a list name=bool pairs to activate or deactivate the mentioned data
       collector.  The second option expects similar pairs of collector name and number  of  seconds  specifying
       the interval at which the collector shall be collected.

       See <b>gnt-cluster</b> <b>init</b> for a description of --install-image and --zeroing-image.

       See <b><a href="../man7/ganeti.7.html">ganeti</a></b>(7) for a description of --submit and other common options.

   <b>QUEUE</b>
       <b>queue</b> {drain | undrain | info}

       Change job queue properties.

       The drain option sets the drain flag on the job queue.  No new jobs will be accepted, but jobs already in
       the queue will be processed.

       The undrain will unset the drain flag on the job queue.  New jobs will be accepted.

       The info option shows the properties of the job queue.

   <b>WATCHER</b>
       <b>watcher</b> {pause <u>duration</u> | continue | info}

       Make the watcher pause or let it continue.

       The pause option causes the watcher to pause for <u>duration</u> seconds.

       The continue option will let the watcher continue.

       The info option shows whether the watcher is currently paused.

   <b>REDIST-CONF</b>
       <b>redist-conf</b> [--submit] [--print-jobid]

       This  command  forces  a  full push of configuration files from the master node to the other nodes in the
       cluster.  This is normally not needed, but can  be  run  if  the  <b>verify</b>  complains  about  configuration
       mismatches.

       See <b><a href="../man7/ganeti.7.html">ganeti</a></b>(7) for a description of --submit and other common options.

   <b>RENAME</b>
       <b>rename</b> [-f] {<u>new-name</u>}

       Renames the cluster and in the process updates the master IP address to the one the new name resolves to.
       At  least  one  of  either  the name or the IP address must be different, otherwise the operation will be
       aborted.

       Note that since this command can be dangerous (especially when run over SSH), the  command  will  require
       confirmation unless run with the -f option.

   <b>RENEW-CRYPTO</b>
       <b>renew-crypto</b> [-f]
       [--new-cluster-certificate] | [--new-node-certificates]
       [--new-confd-hmac-key]
       [--new-rapi-certificate] [--rapi-certificate <u>rapi-cert</u>]
       [--new-spice-certificate | --spice-certificate <u>spice-cert</u>
       --spice-ca-certificate <u>spice-ca-cert</u>]
       [--new-ssh-keys] [--no-ssh-key-check]
       [--new-cluster-domain-secret] [--cluster-domain-secret <u>filename</u>]
       [--ssh-key-type <u>type</u>] | [--ssh-key-bits <u>bits</u>]

       This  command  will stop all Ganeti daemons in the cluster and start them again once the new certificates
       and keys are replicated.  The option --new-confd-hmac-key can be used to regenerate the HMAC key used  by
       <b><a href="../man8/ganeti-confd.8.html">ganeti-confd</a></b>(8).

       The  option  --new-cluster-certificate  will regenerate the cluster-internal server SSL certificate.  The
       option --new-node-certificates will generate new node SSL certificates for all nodes.  Note that for  the
       regeneration  of  of  the  server  SSL certificate will invoke a regeneration of the node certificates as
       well, because node certificates are signed by the server certificate and thus have to  be  recreated  and
       signed by the new server certificate.  Nodes which are offline during a renewal of the server or the node
       certificates  are not accessible anymore once they are marked as online again.  To fix this, please readd
       the node instead.

       To generate a new self-signed RAPI certificate (used by <b><a href="../man8/ganeti-rapi.8.html">ganeti-rapi</a></b>(8))  specify  --new-rapi-certificate.
       If  you  want  to  use  your  own certificate, e.g.  one signed by a certificate authority (CA), pass its
       filename to --rapi-certificate.

       To generate a new self-signed SPICE certificate, used  for  SPICE  connections  to  the  KVM  hypervisor,
       specify  the  --new-spice-certificate option.  If you want to provide a certificate, pass its filename to
       --spice-certificate and pass the signing CA certificate to --spice-ca-certificate.

       The option --new-ssh-keys renews all SSH keys of all nodes and updates the authorized_keys files  of  all
       nodes  to  contain  only  the (new) public keys of all master candidates.  To avoid having to confirm the
       fingerprint of each node use the --no-ssh-key-check option.  Be aware of that this  includes  a  security
       risk as you omit verifying the machines' identities.

       Finally    --new-cluster-domain-secret   generates   a   new,   random   cluster   domain   secret,   and
       --cluster-domain-secret reads the secret from a  file.   The  cluster  domain  secret  is  used  to  sign
       information exchanged between separate clusters via a third party.

       The  options  --ssh-key-type  and ssh-key-bits determine the properties of the disk types used.  They are
       described in more detail in the init option description.

   <b>REPAIR-DISK-SIZES</b>
       <b>repair-disk-sizes</b> [instance-name...]

       This command checks that the recorded size of the given instance's disks  matches  the  actual  size  and
       updates  any  mismatches  found.  This is needed if the Ganeti configuration is no longer consistent with
       reality, as it will impact some disk operations.  If no  arguments  are  given,  all  instances  will  be
       checked.  When exclusive storage is active, also spindles are updated.

       Note  that  only  active  disks  can  be checked by this command; in case a disk cannot be activated it's
       advised to use <b>gnt-instance</b> <b>activate-disks</b> <b>--ignore-size</b> <b>...</b> to force activation without  regard  to  the
       current size.

       When all the disk sizes are consistent, the command will return no output.  Otherwise it will log details
       about the inconsistencies in the configuration.

   <b>UPGRADE</b>
       <b>upgrade</b> {--to <u>version</u> | --resume}

       This command safely switches all nodes of the cluster to a new Ganeti version.  It is a prerequisite that
       the  new  version  is  already  installed,  albeit not activated, on all nodes; this requisite is checked
       before any actions are done.

       If called with the --resume option, any pending upgrade is continued, that was  interrupted  by  a  power
       failure or similar on master.  It will do nothing, if not run on the master node, or if no upgrade was in
       progress.

   <b>VERIFY</b>
       <b>verify</b> [--no-nplus1-mem] [--no-hv-param-assessment]
       [--node-group <u>nodegroup</u>]
       [--error-codes] [{-I|--ignore-errors} <u>errorcode</u>]
       [{-I|--ignore-errors} <u>errorcode</u>...]
       [--verify-ssh-clutter]

       Verify  correctness of cluster configuration.  This is safe with respect to running instances, and incurs
       no downtime of the instances.

       If the --no-nplus1-mem option is given, Ganeti won't check whether if it loses a node it can restart  all
       the instances on their secondaries (and report an error otherwise).

       The  --no-hv-param-assessment  option  disables  the  evaluation  of  hypervisor  parameters  set  on the
       cluster-level.  By default Ganeti will warn about suboptimal settings,  if  implemented  by  the  enabled
       hypervisors.  This will only generate warnings and never influence the return code of the verify run.

       With  --node-group,  restrict the verification to those nodes and instances that live in the named group.
       This will not verify global settings, but will allow to perform  verification  of  a  group  while  other
       operations are ongoing in other groups.

       The    --error-codes    option    outputs    each    error    in    the   following   parseable   format:
       <u>ftype</u>:<u>ecode</u>:<u>edomain</u>:<u>name</u>:<u>msg</u>.  These fields have the following meaning:

       ftype  Failure type.  Can be <u>WARNING</u> or <u>ERROR</u>.

       ecode  Error code of the failure.  See below for a list of error codes.

       edomain
              Can be <u>cluster</u>, <u>node</u> or <u>instance</u>.

       name   Contains the name of the item that is affected from the failure.

       msg    Contains a descriptive error message about the error

       gnt-cluster verify will have a non-zero exit code if at least one of the failures that are found  are  of
       type <u>ERROR</u>.

       The --ignore-errors option can be used to change this behaviour, because it demotes the error represented
       by  the error code received as a parameter to a warning.  The option must be repeated for each error that
       should be ignored (e.g.: -I ENODEVERSION -I ENODEORPHANLV).  The --error-codes  option  can  be  used  to
       determine the error code of a given error.

       Note  that  the  verification  of the configuration file consistency across master candidates can fail if
       there are other concurrently running operations that modify the configuration.

       The --verify-ssh-clutter option checks if more than one SSH key for the same 'user@hostname' pair  exists
       in  the 'authorized_keys' file.  This is only checked for hostnames of nodes which belong to the cluster.
       This check is optional, because there might be other systems manipulating  the  'authorized_keys'  files,
       which would cause too many false positives otherwise.

   <b>VERIFY-DISKS</b>
       <b>verify-disks</b> [--node-group <u>nodegroup</u>] [--no-strict]

       The command checks which instances have degraded DRBD disks and activates the disks of those instances.

       With --node-group, restrict the verification to those nodes and instances that live in the named group.

       The  --no-strict  option  runs the group verify disks job in a non-strict mode.  This only verifies those
       disks whose node locks could be acquired in a best-effort attempt and will skip nodes that are recognized
       as busy with other jobs.

       This command is run from the <b>ganeti-watcher</b> tool, which also has a different, complementary algorithm for
       doing this check.  Together, these two should ensure that DRBD disks are kept consistent.

   <b>VERSION</b>
       <b>version</b>

       Show the cluster version.

   <b>Tags</b>
   <b>ADD-TAGS</b>
       <b>add-tags</b> [--from <u>file</u>] {<u>tag</u>...}

       Add tags to the cluster.  If any of the tags contains  invalid  characters,  the  entire  operation  will
       abort.

       If  the  --from  option  is given, the list of tags will be extended with the contents of that file (each
       line becomes a tag).  In this case, there is not need to pass tags on the command line (if you  do,  both
       sources will be used).  A file name of - will be interpreted as stdin.

   <b>LIST-TAGS</b>
       <b>list-tags</b>

       List the tags of the cluster.

   <b>REMOVE-TAGS</b>
       <b>remove-tags</b> [--from <u>file</u>] {<u>tag</u>...}

       Remove  tags  from the cluster.  If any of the tags are not existing on the cluster, the entire operation
       will abort.

       If the --from option is given, the list of tags to be removed will be extended with the contents of  that
       file (each line becomes a tag).  In this case, there is not need to pass tags on the command line (if you
       do, tags from both sources will be removed).  A file name of - will be interpreted as stdin.

   <b>SEARCH-TAGS</b>
       <b>search-tags</b> {<u>pattern</u>}

       Searches  the  tags on all objects in the cluster (the cluster itself, the nodes and the instances) for a
       given pattern.  The pattern is interpreted as a regular expression and a search will be done on it  (i.e.
       the  given  pattern  is not anchored to the beginning of the string; if you want that, prefix the pattern
       with ^).

       If no tags are matching the pattern, the exit code of the command will be one.  If there is at least  one
       match, the exit code will be zero.  Each match is listed on one line, the object and the tag separated by
       a  space.   The cluster will be listed as /cluster, a node will be listed as /nodes/<u>name</u>, and an instance
       as /instances/<u>name</u>.  Example:

              # gnt-cluster search-tags time
              /cluster ctime:2007-09-01
              /nodes/node1.example.com mtime:2007-10-04
