       apt - command-line interface

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>apt</b> [<b>-h</b>] [<b>-o=</b><u>config_string</u>] [<b>-c=</b><u>config_file</u>] [<b>-t=</b><u>target_release</u>] [<b>-a=</b><u>architecture</u>] {list | search | show
           | update | install <u>pkg</u> [{=<u>pkg_version_number</u> | /<u>target_release</u>}]...  | remove <u>pkg</u>...  | upgrade |
           full-upgrade | edit-sources | {-v | --version} | {-h | --help}}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apt</b> provides a high-level commandline interface for the package management system. It is intended as an
       end user interface and enables some options better suited for interactive usage by default compared to
       more specialized APT tools like <b><a href="../man8/apt-get.8.html">apt-get</a></b>(8) and <b><a href="../man8/apt-cache.8.html">apt-cache</a></b>(8).

       Much like <b>apt</b> itself, its manpage is intended as an end user interface and as such only mentions the most
       used commands and options partly to not duplicate information in multiple places and partly to avoid
       overwhelming readers with a cornucopia of options and details.

       <b>update</b> (<b><a href="../man8/apt-get.8.html">apt-get</a></b>(8))
           <b>update</b> is used to download package information from all configured sources. Other commands operate on
           this data to e.g. perform package upgrades or search in and display details about all packages
           available for installation.

       <b>upgrade</b> (<b><a href="../man8/apt-get.8.html">apt-get</a></b>(8))
           <b>upgrade</b> is used to install available upgrades of all packages currently installed on the system from
           the sources configured via <b><a href="../man5/sources.list.5.html">sources.list</a></b>(5). New packages will be installed if required to satisfy
           dependencies, but existing packages will never be removed. If an upgrade for a package requires the
           removal of an installed package the upgrade for this package isn't performed.

           When a package is supplied as an argument, the package will be installed prior to the upgrade action.

       <b>full-upgrade</b> (<b><a href="../man8/apt-get.8.html">apt-get</a></b>(8))
           full-upgrade performs the function of upgrade but will remove currently installed packages if this is
           needed to upgrade the system as a whole.

           When a package is supplied as an argument, the package will be installed prior to the upgrade action.

       <b>install</b>, <b>reinstall</b>, <b>remove</b>, <b>purge</b> (<b><a href="../man8/apt-get.8.html">apt-get</a></b>(8))
           Performs the requested action on one or more packages specified via <b><a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex</a></b>(7), <b><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></b>(7) or exact match.
           The requested action can be overridden for specific packages by appending a plus (+) to the package
           name to install this package or a minus (-) to remove it.

           A specific version of a package can be selected for installation by following the package name with
           an equals (=) and the version of the package to select. Alternatively the version from a specific
           release can be selected by following the package name with a forward slash (/) and codename (trixie,
           forky, sid ...) or suite name (stable, testing, unstable). This will also select versions from this
           release for dependencies of this package if needed to satisfy the request.

           Removing a package removes all packaged data, but leaves usually small (modified) user configuration
           files behind, in case the remove was an accident. Just issuing an installation request for the
           accidentally removed package will restore its function as before in that case. On the other hand you
           can get rid of these leftovers by calling <b>purge</b> even on already removed packages. Note that this does
           not affect any data or configuration stored in your home directory.

       <b>autoremove</b> (<b><a href="../man8/apt-get.8.html">apt-get</a></b>(8))
           autoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for
           other packages and are now no longer needed as dependencies changed or the package(s) needing them
           were removed in the meantime.

           You should check that the list does not include applications you have grown to like even though they
           were once installed just as a dependency of another package. You can mark such a package as manually
           installed by using <b><a href="../man8/apt-mark.8.html">apt-mark</a></b>(8). Packages which you have installed explicitly via <b>install</b> are also
           never proposed for automatic removal.

       <b>satisfy</b> (<b><a href="../man8/apt-get.8.html">apt-get</a></b>(8))
           <b>satisfy</b> satisfies dependency strings, as used in Build-Depends. It also handles conflicts, by
           prefixing an argument with "Conflicts: ".

           Example: apt satisfy "foo, bar (&gt;= 1.0)" "Conflicts: baz, fuzz"

       <b>why,</b> <b>why-not</b>
           These commands print the reasoning path from the solver. They are similar to the equivalent aptitude
           commands for many use cases, but are different in that they print the actual reason the solver picked
           rather than the potential strongest path.

           The <b>why</b> command determines why an installed package is installed. This provides reasonable feedback
           as to why an automatically installed package is installed; for a manually installed package no other
           reason is given. If the package is not installed, no reason can be determined.

           The <b>why-not</b> command determines why a package was determined to not be installable. This may not
           always yield a result, even if a package is uninstallable.

           Both commands take a single argument, the name of a package.

       <b>search</b> (<b><a href="../man8/apt-cache.8.html">apt-cache</a></b>(8))
           <b>search</b> can be used to search for the given <b><a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex</a></b>(7) term(s) in the list of available packages and
           display matches. This can e.g. be useful if you are looking for packages having a specific feature.
           If you are looking for a package including a specific file try <b><a href="../man1/apt-file.1.html">apt-file</a></b>(1).

       <b>show</b> (<b><a href="../man8/apt-cache.8.html">apt-cache</a></b>(8))
           Show information about the given package(s) including its dependencies, installation and download
           size, sources the package is available from, the description of the packages content and much more.
           It can e.g. be helpful to look at this information before allowing <b><a href="../man8/apt.8.html">apt</a></b>(8) to remove a package or
           while searching for new packages to install.

       <b>list</b>
           <b>list</b> is somewhat similar to <b>dpkg-query</b> <b>--list</b> in that it can display a list of packages satisfying
           certain criteria. It supports <b><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></b>(7) patterns for matching package names, <b><a href="../man7/apt-patterns.7.html">apt-patterns</a></b>(7), as well
           as options to list installed (<b>--installed</b>), upgradeable (<b>--upgradeable</b>) or all available
           (<b>--all-versions</b>) versions.

       <b>edit-sources</b> (work-in-progress)
           edit-sources lets you edit your <b><a href="../man5/sources.list.5.html">sources.list</a></b>(5) files in your preferred text editor while also
           providing basic sanity checks.

       <b>showsrc,</b> <b>depends,</b> <b>rdepends,</b> <b>policy</b> (summarised in <b><a href="../man8/apt-cache.8.html">apt-cache</a></b>(8))

       <b>source,</b> <b>build-dep,</b> <b>download,</b> <b>changelog,</b> <b>clean,</b> <b>distclean,</b> <b>autoclean</b> (summarised in <b><a href="../man8/apt-get.8.html">apt-get</a></b>(8))

</pre><h4><b>SCRIPT</b> <b>USAGE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DIFFERENCES</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>APT</b> <b>TOOLS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b><a href="../man8/apt.8.html">apt</a></b>(8) commandline is designed as an end-user tool and it may change behavior between versions. While
       it tries not to break backward compatibility this is not guaranteed either if a change seems beneficial
       for interactive use.

       All features of <b><a href="../man8/apt.8.html">apt</a></b>(8) are available in dedicated APT tools like <b><a href="../man8/apt-get.8.html">apt-get</a></b>(8) and <b><a href="../man8/apt-cache.8.html">apt-cache</a></b>(8) as well.
       <b><a href="../man8/apt.8.html">apt</a></b>(8) just changes the default value of some options (see <b><a href="../man5/apt.conf.5.html">apt.conf</a></b>(5) and specifically the Binary
       scope). So you should prefer using these commands (potentially with some additional options enabled) in
       your scripts as they keep backward compatibility as much as possible.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apt</b> returns zero on normal operation, decimal 100 on error.
