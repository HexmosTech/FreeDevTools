</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dhcp6c — DHCPv6 client daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dhcp6c</b> [<b>-c</b> <u>configfile</u>] [<b>-Ddfi</b>] [<b>-p</b> <u>pid-file</u>] [<b>-P</b> <u>profile</u>] <u>interface</u> [<u>interfaces...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dhcp6c</b>  works  as  a  DHCPv6  client  and gets information from DHCPv6 servers to configure the specified
       <u>interface</u>.  Multiple <u>interfaces</u> can be specified separated by spaces or tabs, in which case  <b>dhcp6c</b>  will
       work on all the interfaces simultaneously.

       The command line options are:

       <b>-c</b> <u>configfile</u>
               Use <u>configfile</u> as the configuration file.

       <b>-d</b>      Print debugging messages.

       <b>-D</b>      Even more debugging information is printed.

       <b>-f</b>      Foreground  mode  (useful when debugging).  Although <b>dhcp6c</b> usually prints warning, debugging, or
               error messages to <u><a href="../man8/syslog.8.html">syslog</a></u>(8), it  prints  the  messages  to  standard  error  if  this  option  is
               specified.

       <b>-i</b>      Info-req  mode.  In this mode, stateless DHCPv6 is executed with the following configuration, and
               the obtained info is written to stdout.  After this output, <b>dhcp6c</b> is terminated.  (suits  for  a
               use in shell-script etc).

                interface (interface given in the argument) {
                       information-only;
                       script (a script which displays the received information to stdout);
                };

               Since the configuration is internally generated, you cannot provide a configuration in this mode.
               If  you  want to have different actions for the stateless DHCPv6 information, you should write an
               appropriate configuration and invoke <b>dhcp6c</b> without this option.

       <b>-p</b> <u>pid-file</u>
               Use <u>pid-file</u> to dump the process ID of <b>dhcp6c</b>.

       <b>-P</b> <u>profile</u>
               Use the given <u>profile</u> defined in the <b>dhcp6c</b> configuration file for <u>interfaces</u> which do not have a
               specific configuration.

       The program will daemonize itself on invocation unless the <b>-f</b> or <b>-i</b> option is specified.

       Upon receipt of the SIGHUP or SIGTERM signals, <b>dhcp6c</b> will remove all stateful resources from the system.
       In the former case the daemon will then reinvoke itself, while it will stop running in the  latter  case.
       In either case, <b>dhcp6c</b> will send DHCPv6 Release messages to release resources assigned from servers.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/var/run/dhcp6c.pid</u>           is the default file that contains pid of the currently running <b>dhcp6c</b>.
       <u>/etc/wide-dhcpv6/dhcp6c.conf</u>  is the default configuration file.
       <u>/var/lib/dhcpv6/dhcp6c_duid</u>   is the file to store the client's DUID.

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>Script</b></h4><pre>
       When  <b>dhcp6c</b>  receives  a reply message, it will invoke a supplementary configuration script specified in
       the <u><a href="../man5/dhcp6c.conf.5.html">dhcp6c.conf</a></u>(5) file.  The daemon will provide the script with configuration parameters as environment
       variables, which include:

       <b>REASON</b>  The reason why the script is invoked.  As of this writing, the value is  always  "NBI"  and  thus
               meaningless.
       <b>new_domain_name_servers</b>
               A  list  of available DNS servers, each of which is an IPv6 numeric address and is separated by a
               white space character.
       <b>new_domain_name</b>
               A list of DNS names, which provides DNS name search path.
       <b>new_ntp_servers</b>
               A list of available NTP servers, each of which is an IPv6 numeric address and is separated  by  a
               white space character.
       <b>new_sip_servers</b>
               A  list  of  available  SIP  server  addresses,  each  of which is an IPv6 numeric address and is
               separated by a white space character.
       <b>new_sip_name</b>
               A list of SIP server domain names.
       <b>new_nis_servers</b>
               A list of available NIS server addresses, each of  which  is  an  IPv6  numeric  address  and  is
               separated by a white space character.
       <b>new_nis_name</b>
               A list of NIS domain names.
       <b>new_nisp_servers</b>
               A  list  of  available  NIS+  server  addresses,  each of which is an IPv6 numeric address and is
               separated by a white space character.
       <b>new_nisp_name</b>
               A list of NIS+ domain names.
       <b>new_bcmcs_servers</b>
               A list of available BCMCS server addresses, each of which is  an  IPv6  numeric  address  and  is
               separated by a white space character.
       <b>new_bcmcs_name</b>
               A list of BCMCS server domain names.

       Note  that  the  daemon does not always provide all the parameters.  It sets an environment variable only
       when the corresponding configuration parameter is provided by the DHCPv6 server.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>dhcp6c</b> command first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dhcp6c</b> is incomplete and violates DHCPv6 protocol spec, in several  aspects.   In  particular,  temporary
       address assignment is intentionally omitted.

       Information  Refresh  Time  Option  is  not recognized in Info-req mode, since <b>dhcp6c</b> terminates after it
       receives a REPLY message.
