       module-assistant - manage kernel modules packages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>module-assistant</b> [ <b>-fihnqstv</b> ] [ <b>-k</b> <u>source/headers</u> <u>directory</u> ] [ <b>-l</b> <u>kernel</u> <u>versions</u> ] { <b>update</b> | <b>search</b> |
       <b>prepare</b>  | <b>auto-install</b> | <b>list</b> | <b>list-available</b> | <b>list-installed</b> | <b>auto-unpacked</b> | <b>get</b> | <b>unpack</b> | <b>build</b> |

       <b>m-a</b> <b>...</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>module-assistant</b> is the command-line tool for handling module-source packages that have been prepared for
       the Debian distribution. It helps users to build and install module package(s) easily  for  one  or  more
       custom kernels.

       Unless  the  <b>-h</b>,  or  <b>--help</b>  option  is  given,  one of the commands below should be present to invoke a
       function explicitly. If no (or no valid) command is specified and the dialog tool is available, a  simple
       graphical user interface will pop up and guide you trough the available functionality.

       NOTE:  don't  even  think  about  using  some  random linux-source-x.y.z package contents (or linux-x.y.z
       tarball from the Internet) to specify the kernel source for your currently running kernel.  <b>Don't!</b>  Those
       source  is  not exactly what have been used to build the running kernel and its configuration most likely
       does not match yours. You need the configured kernel source directory or  at  least  the  derived  linux-
       headers-...  package  containing  the kernel configuration for the exact kernel version (complete version
       string).  If you do not understand  anything  of  the  above,  run  "m-a  prepare"  and/or  look  at  the
       description  and  contents  of  some  linux-headers-... package.  Please run the <b>module-assistant</b> <b>prepare</b>
       command once before you do anything else.

       For some packages, linux-headers (reduced source) is not enough. You  will  have  the  choice  to  run  a
       completely customized kernel, or to recreate the source that have been used to build the current one. The
       <b>fakesource</b> function may be useful, see below.

       In  order  to  configure  a  kernel  source  properly,  you  need to make sure that the file version.h is
       generated. To get it, configure the options as usual (<b>make</b> <b>menuconfig</b> etc.)  and run <b>make</b> <b>dep</b> (for kernel
       2.4.x) or <b>make</b> <b>prepare</b> (for newer ones).

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Most commands require a specification of the package names that they should be applied on.  <b>pkg</b> can be  a
       single  word (package name) or multiple names. The word <b>all</b> will be expanded to the list of all available
       packages, the word <b>alli</b> to the list of currently installed (source) packages and the word  <b>allu</b>  will  be
       expanded to the list of packages that seem to be installed and unpacked in the base source directory.  If
       a  source  package  with the given name is not available, <b>module-assistant</b> (abbreviated: <b>m-a</b>) will extend
       the package name with the popular suffixes like -kernel, -driver, -module, -source  and  combinations  of
       them.

       Multiple  commands  can  be specified in one invocation, eg. "<b>m-a</b> <b>clean,get,build</b> <b>arla</b> <b>cdfs</b>" is the short
       way to write "module-assistant clean arla-modules-source ;  module-assistant  clean  cdfs-src  ;  module-
       assistant  get  arla-modules-source  cdfs-src  ; module-assistant build arla-modules-source cdfs-src" (or
       similar).

       If you do not like the dialog/whiptail GUI, feel free to use the <b>-t</b> switch to disable it.

       <b>update</b> update is used to resynchronize the version index files from  their  sources.  This  happens  with
              helper  scripts  provided  by  the  packages.  <b>module-assistant</b> has a default built-in list of the
              packages that it should look for but other packages can be registered by <b>module-assistant</b>  if  the
              maintainer adds the helper script.

       <b>prepare</b>
              Tries  to  determine  the  name of the required linux-headers package (either the one matching the
              currently running kernel or for the versions specified with <b>-l</b>), installs it if needed and creates
              the /usr/src/linux symlink if needed. Also installs the build-essential package to ensure  that  a
              sane compiler environment is established.

       <b>fakesource</b>
              Experimental  function  which  tries to determine the name of the required/compatible linux-source
              package,  installs  it,  modifies  the  Makefile  to  look  like  the  original  source  and  runs
              configuration  routines  as  needed.  Warning: DO NOT RELY ON THE RESULTING SOURCE. It may be very
              different from the original version.

       <b>list</b> <b>|</b> <b>list-available</b> <b>|</b> <b>la</b>
              list-available (abbreviated with  la)  presents  a  list  of  details  about  specified  packages,
              including  installed  version,  installable  versions  and  recently built binary packages. If the
              package names are omitted, shows all known packages. With <b>-v</b>, prints long package paths.

       <b>list-installed</b> <b>|</b> <b>li</b>
              Synonym to list alli. Acts like list-available  but  limits  the  list  to  the  installed  source
              packages.

       <b>search</b> Synonym  to  list  -s.  Looks for locally compiled packages first and (if none found) searches for
              alternative installation candidates with apt-cache.

       <b>get</b>    get followed by the package list installs the package source,  downloading  source  packages  when
              needed.

       <b>unpack</b> unpack  is  followed  by one or more previously-installed source packages that should be extracted
              from their source tarballs into build directories.

       <b>build</b>  build is followed by one or more source packages that should  be  built.  It  chooses  the  kernel
              source  appropriate  for  the  currently  running  kernel  unless  different directories have been
              specified. If the build fails, look for the most recent log  file  in  /var/cache/modass  (or  the
              user-specified location).

       <b>install</b>
              install  is  followed by one or more packages desired for installation. The last built package for
              the current running kernel is chosen.

       <b>auto-install</b> <b>|</b> <b>a-i</b>
              auto-install is followed by one or more packages desired for installation. It will run prepare  to
              configure  your  system to build packages, get the package source, try to build it for the current
              kernel and install it.  You can use alli or allu shortcuts to select all installed modules  source
              packages  or  only  those  that  have been unpacked before (similar to the make-kpkg tool normally
              does, looking in $MODULE_LOC)

       <b>auto-build</b> <b>|</b> <b>a-b</b>
              like auto-install but does not install the package immediately

       <b>clean</b>  clean clears the build directories of the kernel packages.

       <b>purge</b>  purge clears the information cache of a source package and removes  all  binary  packages  locally
              built from it (that module-assistant knows about). USE WITH CARE!

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-t</b>

       <b>--text-mode</b>
              Show pure build/install/update logs, no progress bars.

       <b>-k</b>

       <b>--kernel-dir</b>
              The  kernel  source  directories  to be used for builds. You can specify multiple directories with
              multiple options or separated by commas or line separators (e.g using  <b>-k</b>  <b>"`echo</b>  <b>/usr/src/linux-</b>
              <b>headers-*`"</b>  ).   The  kernel versions detected in this directories are automatically added to the
              list of target kernel versions (see <b>--kvers-list</b> for details).

       <b>-l</b>

       <b>--kvers-list</b>
              List of kernel version strings (as in KVERS) to act on. If omitted,  the  version  string  of  the
              currently running kernel is inserted. If <b>--kernel-dir</b> specifies additional source directories, the
              kernel versions that belong to them will be inserted too.

              The  locations  of  the  kernel source (or headers) that belong to this kernel versions are either
              detected by a lookup in the "usual" locations on Linux systems, or they must be specified with the
              <b>--kernel-dir</b> option.

       <b>-v</b>

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Shows a bit more information, like full paths of the binary packages.

       <b>-n</b>

       <b>--no-rebuild</b>
              If a package that is to be generated does already exist in the target directory (maybe in on older
              version), <b>-n</b> prevents from building the package again.

              The default behaviour is to skip when exactly the same file (with the  same  filename)  is  to  be
              generated  as  the one that already exists, and the new filename could be detected before starting
              the build process (depends on the module package).

       <b>-f</b>

       <b>--force</b>
              Never look for target file (in another version) and force a build.  For the get command,  download
              a newer version of a package even if it is already installed.

       <b>-u</b>

       <b>--userdir</b>
              All  relevant environment variables with paths will be redirected to new directories under the one
              specified with this option.

       <b>-i</b>

       <b>--non-inter</b>
              When the package build was not successful,  just  continue  with  other  candidates.  By  default,
              module-assistant  will suggest to examine the build log. This option may also modify the behaviour
              of dpkg and apt-get to reduce the need for human interaction and  install  build  dependencies  as
              needed.

       <b>-o</b>

       <b>--unpack-once</b>
              Try  to not unpack twice. The option needs to be also specified when the package is being unpacked
              for the first time.  Experimental option, don't rely on it.

       <b>-O</b>

       <b>--not-unpack</b>
              Never unpack the source tarball. Useful after manual manipulation of module source.

       <b>-q</b>

       <b>--quiet</b>
              Suppress some of the noisy messages during the processing.

       <b>-S</b>

       <b>--sudo-cmd</b>
              A replacement command for superuser commands to be used instead of sudo.

       <b>-s</b>

       <b>--apt-search</b>
              See search command for details.

       <b>-h</b>

       <b>--help</b> Prints the usage overview.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       You can export the following environment variables to modify the behaviour of  the  build  scripts.  Some
       packages may ignore them or interpret them differently.

       <b>KPKG_DEST_DIR</b>
              KPKG_DEST_DIR  specify the target directory where the resulting Debian package should be installed
              into. However, many packages ignore this variable and install the file into  the  directory  above
              the kernel source directory or above the current directory.

       <b>KERNELDIRS</b>
              KERNELDIRS  specifies or extends the list of kernel source/header directory which m-a should build
              modules for. See /-k/-Option for details.

       <b>SIGNCHANGES</b>
              If SIGNCHANGES is set, .changes files will be  generated  (calling  kdist_image  rule  instead  of
              kdist) and debsign (or gpg or pgp) will be executed to sign the changes.

       <b>KMAINT</b> <b>|</b> <b>DEBFULLNAME</b> <b>|</b> <b>DEBNAME</b>
              Specifies the realname of the person building the package (interesting for .changes file only)

       <b>KEMAIL</b> <b>|</b> <b>DEBEMAIL</b>
              Specifies  the  email  address  of  the person building the package (interesting for .changes file
              only).

       <b>MODULE_LOC</b>
              A  different  location  for  the  (already  extracted)  module  source  directories.  Default   is
              <u>/usr/src/modules</u>.

       <b>MA_VARDIR</b>
              A  different  location  for  cached data, used by helper scripts from <b>module-assistant</b>. Default is
              <u>/var/cache/modass</u>.

       <b>MA_APTCMD</b>
              Command to download install packages, to use instead of the <b>apt-get</b>.

       <b>MOD_SRCDIR</b>
              A different location for module source tarballs. Default is <u><a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a></u>.

       <b>ROOT_CMD</b>
              Wrapper command to execute command as root. If you are not root, fakeroot is chosen automatically.
              This variable must be interpreted by individual packages so some of them may ignore  it.  However,
              you can still run module-assistant inside of the ROOT_CMD wrapper.

</pre><h4><b>NON-ROOT</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>module-assistant</b> can work without being root. However you won't be able to use apt-get or dpkg to install
       the  packages,  and  you cannot write to <u>/var/cache/modass</u> on a normal Debian system. So the commands are
       <b>get</b>, <b>install</b>, <b>auto-install</b> and <b>prepare</b> are taboo for regular users.  However,  if  the  sudo  program  is
       installed,  it  will  be  invoked for apt-get and dpkg operations.  All remaining commands except of <b>list</b>
       require additional environment variables to move the target paths to locations  writable  for  the  user.
       They all can be trimmed to a certain location (a writable directory) using the <b>-u</b> switch.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/usr/share/modass/packages/*</u>
              List of helper scripts shipped with the module-assistant package.

       <u>/usr/share/modass/overrides/*</u>
              Helper scripts installed by other packages.
