</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dkms - Dynamic Kernel Module Support

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dkms</b> [<b>action</b>] [<b>options</b>] [<b>module/module-version</b>] [<b>/path/to/source-tree</b>] [<b>/path/to/tarball.tar</b>]
            [<b>/path/to/driver.rpm</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dkms</b> is a framework which allows kernel modules to be dynamically built for each kernel on your system in
       a simplified and organized fashion.

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>add</b> [<b>module/module-version</b>|<b>/path/to/source-tree</b>|<b>/path/to/tarball.tar</b>]

           Adds   a   module/module-version   combination   to   the   tree   for   builds   and  installs.   If
           <u>module/module-version</u>, <u>-m</u>  <u>module/module-version</u>,  or  <u>-m</u>  <u>module</u> <u>-v</u>  <u>module-version</u>  are  passed  as
           options,  this  command  requires source in <u><a href="file:/usr/src/">/usr/src/</a>&lt;module&gt;-&lt;module-version&gt;/</u> as well as a properly
           formatted <u>dkms.conf</u> file. If <u>/path/to/source-tree</u> is passed as an option, and source-tree contains  a
           <u>dkms.conf</u>   file,   it   will   copy   <u>/path/to/source-tree</u>  to  <u>/usr/src/module-module-version</u>.   If
           <u>/path/to/tarball.tar</u> is passed, this command behaves like the <b>ldtarball</b> command.

       <b>remove</b> [<b>module/module-version</b>] [<b>-k</b> <u>kernel/arch</u>] [<b>--all</b>]

           Removes a module/version or module/version/kernel/arch combination from the tree. If  the  module  is
           currently   installed,  it  first  uninstalls  it  and  if  applicable,  will  replace  it  with  its
           original_module. Use the <b>--all</b> option in order to remove all instances for every kernel at once.

       <b>build</b> [<b>module/module-version</b>] [<b>-k</b> <u>kernel/arch</u>] [<b>--force</b>]

           Builds the specified module/version combo for the specified kernel/arch. If  the  <u>-k</u>  option  is  not
           specified  it  builds  for  the  currently running kernel and arch. All builds occur in the directory
           <u>/var/lib/dkms/&lt;module&gt;/&lt;module-version&gt;/build/.</u>  If the  module/module-version  combo  has  not  been
           added,  dkms will try to add it, and in that case <b>build</b> can take the same arguments that <b>add</b> can.  If
           the module is already built, it will not be rebuilt again by default, and the <b>--force</b>  option  should
           be used to override this.

       <b>unbuild</b> [<b>module/module-version</b>] [<b>-k</b> <u>kernel/arch</u>] [<b>--all</b>]

           Undoes the build for a module/version or module/version/kernel/arch combination from the tree. If the
           module  is  currently  installed,  it first uninstalls it and if applicable, will replace it with its
           original_module. Finally all binary kernel modules are removed. Use the  <b>--all</b>  option  in  order  to
           remove all instances for every kernel at once.

       <b>install</b> [<b>module/module-version</b>] [<b>-k</b> <u>kernel/arch</u>] [<b>--force</b>] [<b>/path/to/driver.rpm</b>]

           Installs  a  built module/version combo onto the kernel it was built for. If the kernel option is not
           specified it assumes the currently running kernel.  If the module has not been built, dkms  will  try
           to  build  it.  If the module has not been added, dkms will try to add it. In both cases, the <b>install</b>
           command can then take the same arguments as the <b>build</b> or <b>add</b> commands.   If  the  module  is  already
           installed,  it  will  not  be  reinstalled again by default, and the <b>--force</b> option should be used to
           override this.  If you pass a .rpm file, dkms will try to install that file with  <b>rpm</b>  <b>-Uvh</b>,  and  it
           will  perform  an  <b>autoinstall</b>  action to be sure that everything is built for your kernel if the RPM
           installed successfully.

       <b>uninstall</b> [<b>module/module-version</b>] [<b>-k</b> <u>kernel/arch</u>] [<b>--all</b>]

           Uninstalls an installed module/module-version combo from the kernel/arch passed in the -k option,  or
           the  current  kernel  if the -k option was not passed. Use the <b>--all</b> option in order to uninstall all
           instances for every kernel at once.  After uninstall completion, the driver will be left in the built
           state.  To completely remove a driver, the remove action should be utilized.

       <b>match</b> [<b>--templatekernel</b> <u>kernel/arch</u>] [<b>-k</b> <u>kernel/arch</u>]

           Match installs modules onto the specified kernel by looking at the  configuration  of  the  specified
           <b>templatekernel.</b>   Every  module that is installed on the <b>templatekernel</b> within <b>dkms</b> is then installed
           on that specified kernel.

       <b>mktarball</b> [<b>module/module-version</b>] [<b>-k</b> <u>kernel/arch</u>] [<b>--archive</b> <u>/path/to/tarball.tar</u>] [<b>--source-only</b>]
                 [<b>--binaries-only</b>]

           Creates a tarball archive for the specified module/version of all files in the  DKMS  tree  for  that
           module/version  combination.  This  includes the source and any built modules for kernels in the tree
           (as specified).  Otherwise, you can specify a singular kernel to archive only, or multiple kernels to
           archive (-k kernel1/arch1 -k kernel2/arch2). Optionally, you can use <b>--archive</b> to  specify  the  file
           that  you  would  like  to save this tarball to. You can also specify <b>--binaries-only</b> if you want the
           resultant tarball not to include the module source. Likewise, <b>--source-only</b> can be  used  to  specify
           that  no  prebuilt  binaries  should  be included in the tarball.  In general, <b>mktarball</b> is great for
           systems management purposes as you can build your driver on just one system and then use <b>ldtarball</b> on
           all of your other systems to get the same built modules loaded without having to wait for anything to
           compile.

       <b>ldtarball</b> [<b>/path/to/tarball.tar</b>] [<b>--force</b>]

           This takes a tarball made from the <b>mktarball</b> command and loads it into  your  DKMS  tree.  This  will
           leave  any  newly  added modules in the built state and <b>dkms</b> <b>install</b> should then be called to install
           any of them. If files already exist where <b>ldtarball</b> is attempting to place them, it will warn and not
           copy over them. The <b>--force</b> option should be used to override this.

       <b>status</b> [<b>module/module-version</b>] [<b>-k</b> <u>kernel/arch</u>]

           Returns the current status of modules, versions and kernels within the tree as well as  whether  they
           have  been  added,  built  or  installed.   Status  can be shown for just a certain module, a certain
           kernel, a module/version combination or a module/version/kernel combination.

       <b>autoinstall</b>

           Attempt to install the latest revision of all modules that  have  been  installed  for  other  kernel
           revisions.  dkms_autoinstaller is a stub that uses this action to perform its work.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-m</b> <b>&lt;module&gt;/&lt;module-version&gt;</b>
              The  name  of  the module and module version you want to operate on. The <b>-m</b> part of this option is
              optional, and can be omitted in virtually all circumstances.

       <b>-v</b> <b>&lt;module-version&gt;</b>
              The version of the module to execute the specified  action  upon.  This  option  only  has  to  be
              specified if you pass a <b>-m</b> option without a &lt;module-version&gt; component of its own.

       <b>-k</b> <b>&lt;kernel-version&gt;/&lt;arch&gt;</b>
              The kernel and arch to perform the action upon. You can specify multiple kernel version/arch pairs
              on  the  command  line  by  repeating  the  -k  argument with a different kernel version and arch.
              However, not all actions support multiple kernel versions (it will error out in this  case).   The
              arch part can be omitted, and DKMS will assume you want it to be the arch of the currently running
              system.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--arch</b>
              The  system  architecture to perform the action upon. It is optional if you pass it as part of the
              <b>-k</b> option. If not specified, it assumes the arch of the currently running system (`uname -m`). You
              can specify multiple arch parameters on the same command line by repeating the -a argument with  a
              different  arch  name. When multiple architectures are specified, there must be a 1:1 relationship
              between -k arguments to -a arguments. DKMS will then assume the first -a argument aligns with  the
              first -k kernel and so on for the second, third, etc.

              For  example,  if you were to specify: -k kernel1 -k kernel2 -a i386 -k kernel3 -a i686 -a x86_64,
              DKMS would process this as: kernel1-i386, kernel2-i686, kernel3-x86_64.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Quiet.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Prints the currently installed version of dkms and exits.

       <b>-c</b> <b>&lt;dkms.conf-location&gt;</b>
              The location of the <u>dkms.conf</u> file. This is needed for the add action and if not specified, it  is
              assumed  to  be located in <u><a href="file:/usr/src/">/usr/src/</a>&lt;module&gt;-&lt;module-version&gt;<a href="file:/.">/.</a></u>  See below for more information on
              the format of <u>dkms.conf.</u>

       <b>--config</b> <b>&lt;kernel-.config-location&gt;</b>
              During a <b>build</b> this option is used to specify an alternate location for the  kernel  .config  file
              which  was  used  to  compile  that  kernel. Normally, <b>dkms</b> uses the Red Hat standard location and
              config filenames located in <u>/usr/src/linux-&lt;kernel&gt;/configs/.</u>  If the config for the  kernel  that
              you  are  building  a  module  for  is not located here or does not have the expected name in this
              location, you will need to tell <b>dkms</b> where the necessary .config can be found so that your  kernel
              can be properly prepared for the module build.

       <b>--archive</b> <b>&lt;tarball-location&gt;</b>
              This  option  is used during a <b>ldtarball</b> action to specify the location of the tarball you wish to
              load into your DKMS tree. You  only  have  to  specify  the  <b>--archive</b>  part  of  this  option  if
              &lt;tarball-location&gt; does not already exist as a file.

       <b>--templatekernel</b> <b>&lt;kernel-version&gt;</b>
              This  option  is  required for the action: <b>match.</b>  Match will look at the templatekernel specified
              and install all of the same module/version combinations on the other kernel.

       <b>--force</b>
              This option can be used in conjunction with <b>ldtarball</b> to force copying over of extant files.

       <b>--binaries-only</b>
              This option can be used in conjunction with <b>mktarball</b> in order to create a DKMS tarball which does
              not contain the source for the module within it. This can be helpful in reducing the size  of  the
              tarball  if you know that the system which this tarball will be loaded upon already has the source
              installed. In order to load a tarball made as binaries-only <b>you</b> <b>must</b> have  the  module  source  in
              that systems DKMS tree. If you do not, DKMS <b>will</b> <b>refuse</b> to load a binaries-only tarball.

       <b>--source-only</b>
              This  option  can  be used in conjunction with <b>mktarball</b> but do not want the tarball you create to
              have any prebuilt modules within it, passing this option will keep its internal DKMS tarball  from
              containing any prebuilt modules.

       <b>--all</b>  This  option can be used to automatically specify all relevant kernels/arches for a module/module-
              version. This can be used for things like remove, unbuild and uninstall. This saves the trouble of
              having to actually specify -k kernel1 -a arch1 -k kernel2 -a arch2 for every kernel you have built
              your module for.

       <b>--no-depmod</b>
              This option prevents DKMS from running the depmod command during <b>install</b> and <b>uninstall</b> which  will
              avoid (re)calculating module dependencies and thereby save time.

       <b>--modprobe-on-install</b>
              This option executes modprobe on the modules upon successful installation.

       <b>--kernelsourcedir</b> <b>&lt;kernel-source-directory-location&gt;</b>
              Using  this  option  you can specify the location of your kernel source directory. Most likely you
              will   not   need   to    set    this    if    your    kernel    source    is    accessible    via
              <u><a href="file:/lib/modules/">/lib/modules/</a>$kernel_version/build.</u>

       <b>--directive</b> <b>&lt;"cli-directive=cli-value"&gt;</b>
              Using  this  option,  you can specify additional directives from the command line. The <b>--directive</b>
              option can be used multiple times on the same command-line to specify multiple additional  command
              line directives.

       <b>--rpm_safe_upgrade</b>
              This  flag  should  be  used  when  packaging DKMS enabled modules in RPMs. It should be specified
              during both the <b>add</b> and <b>remove</b> actions in the  RPM  spec  to  ensure  that  DKMS  and  RPM  behave
              correctly  in  all  scenarios when upgrading between various versions of a dkms enabled module RPM
              package.

       <b>--dkmstree</b> <b>path/to/place</b>
              Provides a destination tree for building and installing modules to. Useful in cases that you don't
              want to contaminate a system when using solely for building.

       <b>--sourcetree</b> <b>path/to/place</b>
              Provides a location to build a DKMS package from. Useful for systems that you may  not  have  root
              access, but would still like to be able to build DKMS packages.

       <b>--installtree</b> <b>path/to/place</b>
              Provides a location to place modules when a <u>dkms</u> <u>install</u> command is issued.

       <b>-j</b> <b>number</b>
              Run no more than <u>number</u> jobs in parallel; see the -j option of <u><a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a>(1).</u>  Defaults to the number of
              CPUs  in the system, detected by <u><a href="../man1/nproc.1.html">nproc</a>(1).</u>  Specify 0 to impose no limit on the number of parallel
              jobs.

</pre><h4><b>ORIGINAL</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       During the first install of a module for a &lt;kernelversion&gt;, <b>dkms</b> will search <u><a href="file:/lib/modules/">/lib/modules/</a>&lt;kernelversion&gt;</u>
       for a pre-existing module of the same name. If one is  found,  it  will  automatically  be  saved  as  an
       "original_module" so that if the newer module is later removed, <b>dkms</b> will put the original module back in
       its  place.  Currently,  DKMS  searches for these original modules with first preference going to modules
       located in <u><a href="file:/lib/modules/">/lib/modules/</a>&lt;kernelversion&gt;/updates/</u>  followed  by  <b>$DEST_MODULE_LOCATION</b>  (as  specified  in
       <u>dkms.conf</u>  ).  If  one  cannot  be  found  in either location, a find will be used to locate one for that
       kernel.  If none are found, then during a  later  uninstall,  your  kernel  will  not  have  that  module
       replaced.

       If  more than one is found, then the first one located (by preference indicated above) will be considered
       the "original_module". As well, all copies of the same-named module will be removed from your kernel tree
       and  placed  into  <u>/var/lib/dkms/&lt;module&gt;/original_module/$kernelver/collisions</u>  so  that  they  can   be
       *manually*  accessible  later. DKMS will never actually do anything with the modules found underneath the
       /collisions directory, and they will be stored there until you manually delete them.

</pre><h4><b>DKMS.CONF</b></h4><pre>
       When performing an <b>add</b>, a proper <u>dkms.conf</u> file  must  be  found.  A  properly  formatted  conf  file  is
       essential  for  communicating  to  <b>dkms</b>  how  and where the module should be installed. While not all the
       directives are required, providing as many as possible helps  to  limit  any  ambiguity.  Note  that  the
       <u>dkms.conf</u>  is  really  only  a shell-script of variable definitions which are then sourced in by the <b>dkms</b>
       executable  (of  the  format,  DIRECTIVE="directive  text  goes  here").  As  well,  the  directives  are
       case-sensitive and should be given in <b>ALL</b> <b>CAPS.</b>

       It  is  important  to  understand that many of the DKMS directives are arrays whose index values are tied
       together. These array associations can be  considered  families,  and  there  are  currently  three  such
       families  of  directive arrays. MAKE[#] and MAKE_MATCH[#] make up one family. PATCH[#] and PATCH_MATCH[#]
       make  up  the  second  family.  The  third  and  largest   family   consists   of   BUILT_MODULE_NAME[#],
       BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION[#],  DEST_MODULE_NAME[#], DEST_MODULE_LOCATION[#] and STRIP[#]. When indexing these
       arrays when creating your dkms.conf, each family should start at index value 0.

       <b>PACKAGE_NAME=</b>
              This directive is used to give the name associated with the entire package of modules. This is the
              same name that is used with the <b>-m</b> option when building, adding, etc. and may not  necessarily  be
              the same as the MODULE_NAME. This directive must be present in every dkms.conf.

       <b>PACKAGE_VERSION=</b>
              This  directive  is  used  to give the version associated with the entire package of modules being
              installed within that dkms package. This directive must be present in every dkms.conf.

       <b>BUILT_MODULE_NAME[#]=</b>
              This directive gives the name of the module just after it is built. If your  DKMS  module  package
              contains  more  than  one  module to install, this is a <b>required</b> directive for all of the modules.
              This directive should explicitly not contain any trailing ".o"  or  ".ko".   Note  that  for  each
              module   within  a  dkms  package,  the  numeric  value  of  <b>#</b>  must  be  the  same  for  each  of
              BUILT_MODULE_NAME, BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION, DEST_MODULE_NAME and DEST_MODULE_LOCATION and  that  the
              numbering should start at 0 (eg. BUILT_MODULE_NAME[0]="qla2200" BUILT_MODULE_NAME[1]="qla2300").

       <b>BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION[#]=</b>
              This  directive  tells DKMS where to find your built module after it has been built. This pathname
              should be given relative to the root directory of your source files (where your dkms.conf file can
              be found). If unset, DKMS expects to find your <b>BUILT_MODULE_NAME[#]</b> in the root directory of  your
              source files.  Note that for each module within a dkms package, the numeric value of <b>#</b> must be the
              same    for    each    of    BUILT_MODULE_NAME,    BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION,   DEST_MODULE_NAME   and
              DEST_MODULE_LOCATION    and    that    the    numbering     should     start     at     0     (eg.
              BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION[0]="some/dir/" BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION[1]="other/dir/").

       <b>DEST_MODULE_NAME[#]=</b>
              This  directive can be used to specify the name of the module as it should be installed. This will
              rename the  module  from  <b>BUILT_MODULE_NAME[#]</b>  to  <b>DEST_MODULE_NAME[#].</b>   This  directive  should
              explicitly not contain any trailing ".o" or ".ko". If unset, it is assumed to be the same value as
              <b>BUILT_MODULE_NAME[#].</b>   Note  that  for  each module within a dkms package, the numeric value of <b>#</b>
              must be the same  for  each  of  BUILT_MODULE_NAME,  BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION,  DEST_MODULE_NAME  and
              DEST_MODULE_LOCATION     and     that     the     numbering     should    start    at    0    (eg.
              DEST_MODULE_NAME[0]="qla2200_6x" DEST_MODULE_NAME[1]="qla2300_6x").

       <b>DEST_MODULE_LOCATION[#]=</b>
              This directive specifies the destination where a module should be installed to, once compiled.  It
              also  is  used  for finding original_modules. This is a <b>required</b> directive, except as noted below.
              This   directive   must   start   with   the   text   "/kernel"   which   is   in   reference   to
              <a href="file:/lib/modules/">/lib/modules/</a>&lt;kernelversion&gt;/kernel.  Note that for each module within a dkms package, the numeric
              value of <b>#</b> must be the same for each of BUILT_MODULE_NAME, BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION, DEST_MODULE_NAME
              and    DEST_MODULE_LOCATION    and    that    the    numbering    should    start    at   0   (eg.
              DEST_MODULE_LOCATION[0]="/kernel/drivers/something/"
              DEST_MODULE_LOCATION[1]="/kernel/drivers/other/").

              DEST_MODULE_LOCATION is ignored on  Fedora  and  Red  Hat  Enterprise  Linux,  Novell  SuSE  Linux
              Enterprise  Server  10  and  higher,  Novell  SuSE Linux 10.0 and higher, and Ubuntu. Instead, the
              proper distribution-specific directory is used.

       <b>STRIP[#]=</b>
              By default strip is considered to be "yes". If set to "no", DKMS will not  run  strip  -g  against
              your  built module to remove debug symbols from it.  STRIP[0] is used as the default for any unset
              entries in the STRIP array.

       <b>MAKE[#]=</b>
              The MAKE directive array tells DKMS which make command should be used for  building  your  module.
              The default make command should be put into <b>MAKE[0].</b>  Other entries in the MAKE array will only be
              used  if  their  corresponding entry in <b>MAKE_MATCH[#]</b> matches, as a regular expression (using grep
              -E), the kernel that the module is  being  built  for.   Note  that  if  no  value  is  placed  in
              <b>MAKE_MATCH[#]</b>  for any <b>MAKE[#]</b> where # &gt; 0, then that <b>MAKE</b> directive is ignored.  <b>MAKE_MATCH[0]</b> is
              optional and if it is populated, it will be used to determine if MAKE[0] should be used  to  build
              the module for that kernel. If multiple <b>MAKE_MATCH</b> directives match against the kernel being built
              for,  the  last  matching  <b>MAKE[#]</b>  will  be  used  to  build your module. If no MAKE directive is
              specified or if no MAKE_MATCH matches the kernel being built for,  DKMS  will  attempt  to  use  a
              generic MAKE command to build your module.

              KERNELRELEASE  will  be  automatically appended to MAKE[#]. If you want to suppress this behavior,
              you can quote the make command: 'make'.

       <b>MAKE_MATCH[#]=</b>
              See the above entry on <b>MAKE[#]</b> directives. This array should be populated with regular expressions
              which, when matched against the kernel being built for, will tell <b>DKMS</b> to  use  the  corresponding
              make command in the <b>MAKE[#]</b> directive array to build your module.

       <b>CLEAN=</b> CLEAN  specifies  the make clean command to be used to clean up both before and after building the
              module. If unset, it is assumed to be "make clean".

       <b>NO_WEAK_MODULES=</b>
              The <b>NO_WEAK_MODULES</b> parameter  prevents  dkms  from  creating  a  symlink  into  the  weak-updates
              directory,  which is the default on Red Hat derivatives. The weak modules facility was designed to
              eliminate the need to rebuild kernel modules when kernel upgrades occur and relies on the  symbols
              within the kABI.

              Fedora  does not guaranteed a stable kABI so it should be disabled in the specific module override
              by setting it to "yes". For example, for an Nvidia DKMS module you  would  set  the  following  in
              /etc/dkms/nvidia.conf:

              NO_WEAK_MODULES="yes"

       <b>OBSOLETE_BY=</b>
              This  directive  allows  you  to  specify  a  kernel version that obsoletes the necessity for this
              particular DKMS module. This can be specified as a particular upstream kernel or an ABI bump of  a
              kernel.  For  example, "2.6.24" would be an upstream kernel and "2.6.24-16" would represent an ABI
              bump for a kernel. Both are valid in this area.

              Please avoid the use of <b>OBSOLETE_BY</b> wherever possible. It's use indicates a lack of proper  module
              versioning  using  <b>MODULE_VERSION()</b>  tags  in  the  module  source itself. It is better to fix the
              <b>MODULE_VERSION()</b> tags than use <b>OBSOLETE_BY.</b>  This also introduces a implicit  distribution/version
              dependency  on  the  package,  as  the value of <b>OBSOLETE_BY</b> is meaningful only in the context of a
              single distribution/version.

              If you feel you must use it, please use as such in dkms.conf:

               ubuntu_804="Ubuntu
               8.04"
               if [ -x <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?lsb_release">/usr/bin/lsb_release</a> ]; then
                 if [ "$(<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?lsb_release">/usr/bin/lsb_release</a> -sir)" == "${ubuntu_804}" ]; then
                   OBSOLETE_BY="2.6.25"
                 fi
               fi

       <b>PATCH[#]=</b>
              Use the PATCH directive array to specify patches which should be applied to your source  before  a
              build  occurs.   All  patches  are expected to be in -p1 format and are applied with the patch -p1
              command.  Each directive should specify the filename of the patch to apply, and all  patches  must
              be     located     in     the    patches    subdirectory    of    your    source    directory    (
              <u><a href="file:/usr/src/">/usr/src/</a>&lt;module&gt;-&lt;module-version&gt;/patches/</u> ). If any patch fails to  apply,  the  build  will  be
              halted  and the rejections can be inspected in <u>/var/lib/dkms/&lt;module&gt;/&lt;module-version&gt;/build/.</u>  If
              a PATCH should only be applied conditionally, the <b>PATCH_MATCH[#]</b>  array  should  be  used,  and  a
              corresponding  regular expression should be placed in <b>PATCH_MATCH[#]</b> which will alert dkms to only
              use that <b>PATCH[#]</b> if the regular expression matches the kernel which the module is currently being
              built for.

       <b>PATCH_MATCH[#]=</b>
              See the above description for <b>PATCH[#]</b> directives. If you only want a  patch  applied  in  certain
              scenarios,  the  <b>PATCH_MATCH</b> array should be utilized by giving a regular expression which matches
              the kernels you intend the corresponding <b>PATCH[#]</b> to be applied to before building that module.

       <b>AUTOINSTALL=</b>
              If this directive  is  set  to  <b>yes</b>  then  the  service  <u>/etc/rc.d/init.d/dkms_autoinstaller</u>  will
              automatically  try  to  install  this  module  on  any  kernel  you  boot into. See the section on
              <b>dkms_autoinstaller</b> for more information.

       <b>BUILD_DEPENDS[#]=</b>
              This optional directive is an array that allows you to specify other modules as  dependencies  for
              your  module.  Each  array element should be the <b>PACKAGE_NAME</b> of another module that is managed by
              dkms. Do not specify a version or architecture in the dependency. Note that this directive is only
              advisory; missing or broken dependencies cause non-fatal warnings.

       <b>BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL=</b>
              This optional directive allows you to specify a regular expression which  defines  the  subset  of
              kernels  which  DKMS  is allowed to build your module for.  If the kernel being built for does not
              match against this regular expression (or does not  the  satisfy  the  constraints  of  any  other
              <b>BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_*</b>  directive),  the  dkms  build will error out with exit code 77.  Note that dkms
              autoinstall will ignore this type of error condition and simply skip the respective modules.   For
              example, if you set it as ="^2.4.*", your module would not be built for 2.6 or later kernels.

       <b>BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL_MIN=</b>
              and  <b>BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL_MAX=</b>  These  optional  directives allow one to specify the minimal and
              maximal kernel versions supported by the module. If one (or both) of these are defined, the module
              will not be built for kernels outside the specified version  limits.   For  example,  if  you  set
              <b>BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL_MIN</b>  as  "=3.5", your module would be built for e.g. "3.5-rc2", "3.6.18" or
              other  later  versions  but  not  for  "3.4.999"  or  earlier  kernels.   Similarly,  if  you  set
              <b>BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL_MAX</b>  as  ="4.12", your module would be built for e.g. "4.11.999", "3.9-rc5"
              or other earlier versions, but not for "4.12-rc1" or later kernels.

       <b>BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_ARCH=</b>
              This optional directive functions very similarly to <b>BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL</b> except that it  matches
              against  the  kernel architecture. For example, if you set it to ="i.86", your module would not be
              built for ia32e, x86_64, amd64, s390, etc.

       <b>BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_CONFIG=</b>
              This optional directive allows you to specify a  space  separated  list  of  kernel  configuration
              options  ("CONFIG_FOO")  that must be enabled in the targeted kernels ".config" file (either to be
              compiled in or to be built as a module) or absent (if prefixed  with  an  exclamation  mark,  e.g.
              "!CONFIG_BAR")  in  order  to  build  the  module.   For  example,  if  you set it as ="CONFIG_PCI
              !CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT", your module would only be built for kernels that have PCI enabled, but the RT
              patchset disabled.

       <b>POST_ADD=</b>
              The name of the script to be run after an <b>add</b> is performed. The path should be given  relative  to
              the root directory of your source.

       <b>POST_BUILD=</b>
              The  name of the script to be run after a <b>build</b> is performed. The path should be given relative to
              the root directory of your source.

       <b>POST_INSTALL=</b>
              The name of the script to be run after an <b>install</b> is performed. The path should be given  relative
              to the root directory of your source.

       <b>POST_REMOVE=</b>
              The name of the script to be run after a <b>remove</b> is performed. The path should be given relative to
              the root directory of your source.

       <b>PRE_BUILD=</b>
              The name of the script to be run before a <b>build</b> is performed. The path should be given relative to
              the root directory of your source.

       <b>PRE_INSTALL=</b>
              The name of the script to be run before an <b>install</b> is performed. The path should be given relative
              to  the root directory of your source. If the script exits with a non-zero value, the install will
              be aborted. This is typically used to perform a custom version comparison.

       <b>DKMS.CONF</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>
              Within your <u>dkms.conf</u> file, you can use certain variables which will be replaced at run-time  with
              their values.

       <b>$kernelver</b>
              This  variable can be used within a directive definition and during use, the actual kernel version
              in question will be substituted in its place. This is especially  useful  in  MAKE  commands  when
              specifying  which INCLUDE statements should be used when compiling your module (eg. MAKE="make all
              INCLUDEDIR=<a href="file:/lib/modules/">/lib/modules/</a>${kernelver}/build/include").

       <b>$kernel_source_dir</b>
              This variable holds the value of the location of your kernel source directory. Usually, this  will
              be <u><a href="file:/lib/modules/">/lib/modules/</a>$kernelver/build</u>, unless otherwise specified with the <b>--kernelsourcedir</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>DKMS.CONF</b> <b>OVERRIDES</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  override  the  module-provided <u>dkms.conf</u> files. Every time after a dkms.conf file is read, dkms
       will look for and read the following files in order:

       <u>/etc/dkms/&lt;module&gt;.conf</u>
       <u>/etc/dkms/&lt;module&gt;-&lt;module-version&gt;.conf</u>
       <u>/etc/dkms/&lt;module&gt;-&lt;module-version&gt;-&lt;kernel&gt;.conf</u>
       <u>/etc/dkms/&lt;module&gt;-&lt;module-version&gt;-&lt;kernel&gt;-&lt;arch&gt;.conf</u>

       You can use these files to override settings in the module-provided dkms.conf files.

</pre><h4><b>/etc/dkms/framework.conf</b></h4><pre>
       This configuration file controls how the overall DKMS framework handles. It is sourced in every time  the
       dkms command is run. Mainly it can currently be used to set different default values for the variables.

       The file contains descriptions for each directive it supports.

       Additionally  to  /etc/dkms/framework.conf,  <b>any</b> <b>file</b> <b>matching</b> <b>the</b> <b>glob</b> /etc/dkms/framework.conf.d/*.conf
       will be loaded as well.

       <b>$dkms_tree,</b> <b>$source_tree,</b> <b>$install_tree,</b> <b>$tmp_location</b>
              Control which folders DKMS uses for components and artifacts.

       <b>$verbose</b>
              Can be set to anything but a null value to enable verbose output in DKMS.

       <b>$symlink_modules</b>
              Controls whether binary modules are copied to <a href="file:/lib/modules">/lib/modules</a> or if only symlinks are created  there.
              Note  that  these  variables  can  also  be  manipulated  on  the  command  line  with --dkmstree,
              --sourcetree, --installtree and --symlink-modules options.

       <b>$autoinstall_all_kernels</b>
              Used by the common postinst for DKMS modules. It controls if the build  should  be  done  for  all
              installed  kernels  or  only  for  the current and latest installed kernel. It has no command line
              equivalent.

       <b>$sign_file</b>
              This is the path of the <u>sign-file</u> kernel binary that is used  to  sign  the  kernel  modules.  The
              variable  <b>$kernelver</b>  can be used in path to represent the target kernel version. The path for the
              binary depends on the distribution.

       <b>$mok_signing_key,</b> <b>$mok_certificate</b>
              Location of the key and certificate files used for Secure boot. The  variable  <b>$kernelver</b>  can  be
              used  in  path to represent the target kernel version.  <u>mok_signing_key</u> can also be a "pkcs11:..."
              string for PKCS#11 engine, as long as the sign_file program supports it.

       <b>$modprobe_on_install</b>
              Automatically load the built modules upon successful installation.

</pre><h4><b>dkms_autoinstaller</b></h4><pre>
       This boot-time service automatically installs any module which has <b>AUTOINSTALL="yes"</b> set in its <b>dkms.conf</b>
       file. The service works quite simply and if multiple versions of a module are in your system's DKMS tree,
       it will not do anything and instead explain that manual intervention is required.
