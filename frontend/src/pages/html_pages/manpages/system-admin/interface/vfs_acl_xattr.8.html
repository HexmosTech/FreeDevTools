       vfs_acl_xattr - Save NTFS-ACLs in Extended Attributes (EAs)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       vfs objects = acl_xattr

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This VFS module is part of the <b><a href="../man7/samba.7.html">samba</a></b>(7) suite.

       This module is made for systems which do not support standardized NFS4 ACLs but only a deprecated POSIX
       ACL draft implementation. This is usually the case on Linux systems. Systems that do support just use
       NFSv4 ACLs directly instead of this module. Such support is usually provided by the filesystem VFS module
       specific to the underlying filesystem that supports NFS4 ACLs

       The vfs_acl_xattr VFS module stores NTFS Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Extended Attributes (EAs). This
       enables the full mapping of Windows ACLs on Samba servers even if the ACL implementation is not capable
       of doing so.

       The NT ACLs are stored in the <u>security.NTACL</u> extended attribute of files and directories in a form
       containing the Windows SID representing the users and groups in the ACL. This is different from the uid
       and gids stored in local filesystem ACLs and the mapping from users and groups to Windows SIDs must be
       consistent in order to maintain the meaning of the stored NT ACL That extended attribute is <u>not</u> listed by
       the Linux command getfattr -d filename. To show the current value, the name of the EA must be specified
       (e.g.  getfattr -n security.NTACL filename).

       This module forces the following parameters:

              •   inherit acls = true

              •   dos filemode = true

              •   force unknown acl user = true

       This module is stackable.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       acl_xattr:security_acl_name = NAME
           This option allows to redefine the default location for the NTACL extended attribute (xattr). If not
           set, NTACL xattrs are written to security.NTACL which is a protected location, which means the
           content of the security.NTACL attribute is not accessible from normal users outside of Samba. When
           this option is set to use a user-defined value, e.g. user.NTACL then any user can potentially access
           and overwrite this information. The module prevents access to this xattr over SMB, but the xattr may
           still be accessed by other means (eg local access, SSH, NFS). This option must only be used when this
           consequence is clearly understood and when specific precautions are taken to avoid compromising the
           ACL content.

       acl_xattr:ignore system acls = [yes|no]
           When set to <u>yes</u>, a best effort mapping from/to the POSIX draft ACL layer will <u>not</u> be done by this
           module. The default is <u>no</u>, which means that Samba keeps setting and evaluating both the system ACLs
           and the NT ACLs. This is better if you need your system ACLs be set for local or NFS file access,
           too. If you only access the data via Samba you might set this to yes to achieve better NT ACL
           compatibility.

           If <u>acl_xattr:ignore</u> <u>system</u> <u>acls</u> is set to <u>yes</u>, the following additional settings will be enforced:

                  •   create mask = 0666

                  •   directory mask = 0777

                  •   map archive = no

                  •   map hidden = no

                  •   map readonly = no

                  •   map system = no

                  •   store dos attributes = yes

       acl_xattr:default acl style = [posix|windows|everyone]
           This parameter determines the type of ACL that is synthesized in case a file or directory lacks an
           <u>security.NTACL</u> xattr.

           When set to <u>posix</u>, an ACL will be synthesized based on the POSIX mode permissions for user, group and
           others, with an additional ACE for <u>NT</u> <u>Authority\SYSTEM</u> will full rights.

           When set to <u>windows</u>, an ACL is synthesized the same way Windows does it, only including permissions
           for the owner and <u>NT</u> <u>Authority\SYSTEM</u>.

           When set to <u>everyone</u>, an ACL is synthesized giving full permissions to everyone (S-1-1-0).

           The default for this option is <u>posix</u>.
