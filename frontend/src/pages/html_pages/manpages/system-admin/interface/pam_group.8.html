</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pam_group - PAM module for group access

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>pam_group.so</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The pam_group PAM module does not authenticate the user, but instead it grants group memberships (in the
       credential setting phase of the authentication module) to the user. Such memberships are based on the
       service they are applying for.

       By default rules for group memberships are taken from config file /etc/security/group.conf.

       This module's usefulness relies on the file-systems accessible to the user. The point being that once
       granted the membership of a group, the user may attempt to create a <b>setgid</b> binary with a restricted group
       ownership. Later, when the user is not given membership to this group, they can recover group membership
       with the precompiled binary. The reason that the file-systems that the user has access to are so
       significant, is the fact that when a system is mounted <u>nosuid</u> the user is unable to create or execute
       such a binary file. For this module to provide any level of security, all file-systems that the user has
       write access to should be mounted <u>nosuid</u>.

       The pam_group module functions in parallel with the <a href="file:/etc/group">/etc/group</a> file. If the user is granted any groups
       based on the behavior of this module, they are granted <u>in</u> <u>addition</u> to those entries <a href="file:/etc/group">/etc/group</a> (or
       equivalent).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This module does not recognise any options.

</pre><h4><b>MODULE</b> <b>TYPES</b> <b>PROVIDED</b></h4><pre>
