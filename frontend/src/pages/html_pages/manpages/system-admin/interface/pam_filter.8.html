</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pam_filter - PAM filter module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>pam_filter.so</b> [debug] [new_term] [non_term] run1|run2 <u>filter</u> [<u>...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is intended to be a platform for providing access to all of the input/output that passes
       between the user and the application. It is only suitable for tty-based and (stdin/stdout) applications.

       To function this module requires <u>filters</u> to be installed on the system. The single filter provided with
       the module simply transposes upper and lower case letters in the input and output streams. (This can be
       very annoying and is not kind to termcap based editors).

       Each component of the module has the potential to invoke the desired filter. The filter is always
       <b><a href="../man2/execv.2.html">execv</a></b>(2) with the privilege of the calling application and <u>not</u> that of the user. For this reason it
       cannot usually be killed by the user without closing their session.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       debug
           Print debug information.

       new_term
           The default action of the filter is to set the <u>PAM_TTY</u> item to indicate the terminal that the user is
           using to connect to the application. This argument indicates that the filter should set <u>PAM_TTY</u> to
           the filtered pseudo-terminal.

       non_term
           don't try to set the <u>PAM_TTY</u> item.

       runX
           In order that the module can invoke a filter it should know when to invoke it. This argument is
           required to tell the filter when to do this.

           Permitted values for <u>X</u> are <u>1</u> and <u>2</u>. These indicate the precise time that the filter is to be run. To
           understand this concept it will be useful to have read the <b><a href="../man3/pam.3.html">pam</a></b>(3) manual page. Basically, for each
           management group there are up to two ways of calling the module's functions. In the case of the
           <u>authentication</u> and <u>session</u> components there are actually two separate functions. For the case of
           authentication, these functions are <b><a href="../man3/pam_authenticate.3.html">pam_authenticate</a></b>(3) and <b><a href="../man3/pam_setcred.3.html">pam_setcred</a></b>(3), here <b>run1</b> means run the
           filter from the <b>pam_authenticate</b> function and <b>run2</b> means run the filter from <b>pam_setcred</b>. In the case
           of the session modules, <u>run1</u> implies that the filter is invoked at the <b><a href="../man3/pam_open_session.3.html">pam_open_session</a></b>(3) stage, and
           <u>run2</u> for <b><a href="../man3/pam_close_session.3.html">pam_close_session</a></b>(3).

           For the case of the account component. Either <u>run1</u> or <u>run2</u> may be used.

           For the case of the password component, <u>run1</u> is used to indicate that the filter is run on the first
           occasion of <b><a href="../man3/pam_chauthtok.3.html">pam_chauthtok</a></b>(3) (the <u>PAM_PRELIM_CHECK</u> phase) and <u>run2</u> is used to indicate that the
           filter is run on the second occasion (the <u>PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK</u> phase).

       filter
           The full pathname of the filter to be run and any command line arguments that the filter might
           expect.

</pre><h4><b>MODULE</b> <b>TYPES</b> <b>PROVIDED</b></h4><pre>
       All module types (<b>auth</b>, <b>account</b>, <b>password</b> and <b>session</b>) are provided.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       PAM_SUCCESS
           The new filter was set successfully.

       PAM_ABORT
           Critical error, immediate abort.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Add the following line to <a href="file:/etc/pam.d/login">/etc/pam.d/login</a> to see how to configure login to transpose upper and lower
       case letters once the user has logged in:

                   session required pam_filter.so run1 /lib/security/pam_filter/upperLOWER
