</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ubiquity — install Ubuntu from a live CD

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ubiquity</b> [<b>--desktop</b> <u>file</u>] [<b>--debug</b>] [<b>--pdb</b>] [<b>--cdebconf</b>] [<b>--automatic</b>] [<b>--only</b>] [<b>--query</b>] [<u>frontend</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ubiquity</b>  is a graphical installer for Ubuntu, written largely in Python, using <b>debian-installer</b> (<b>d-i</b>) as
       a backend for many of its functions.  It is  normally  invoked  from  a  desktop  icon,  and  presents  a
       "wizard"-style  graphical user interface.  <b>ubiquity</b> must be run as root, and will escalate privileges for
       itself using <b>gksudo</b>, <b>kdesu</b>, <b>kdesudo</b>, or <b>sudo</b> as appropriate.

       <b>ubiquity</b> has multiple frontends, including one written using  GTK+  (<b>gtk_ui</b>)  and  one  written  for  KDE
       (<b>kde_ui</b>).  The first non-option argument, if any, is interpreted as the name of the frontend to use.

       The following options are available:

       <b>--desktop</b> <u>file</u>
             This  option  is  passed  through  to  <b>gksudo</b>  to  provide  a better description for its privilege-
             escalation message.  It is only relevant when using the <b>gtk_ui</b> frontend.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
             Run in debugging mode, sending verbose information to <u>/var/log/installer/debug</u> that may  be  useful
             to   developers.    (The  <u><a href="file:/var/log/syslog">/var/log/syslog</a></u>  file  is  usually  required  in  any  case,  along  with
             <u>/var/log/partman</u> in the case of problems related to partitioning.)  <u>Note</u>  <u>that</u>  <u>passwords</u>  <u>will</u>  <u>be</u>
             <u>logged</u> <u>in</u> <u>debugging</u> <u>mode!</u>

       <b>--pdb</b>
             Drop  into  the  Python  debugger in the event of a crash.  Only effective if <b>ubiquity</b> is being run
             from a terminal.

       <b>--cdebconf</b>
             Use <b>cdebconf</b> instead of the traditional Perl <b>debconf</b> implementation.  In future  this  may  provide
             enough  memory  efficiency benefits to be made the default, but for now it is not really worthwhile
             and is therefore for experimental use only.

       <b>--automatic</b>
             Skip over questions that have been pre-answered by use of a  preseed  file.   This  is  useful  for
             unattended installations.

       <b>--only</b>
             Tell  <b>ubiquity</b>  that  it  is  the  only  desktop  program running so that it can customize its user
             interface to better suit a minimal environment.  This allows the installer to  be  run  standalone,
             reducing memory requirements.

       <b>--query</b>
             Print the frontend that would be used and then exit.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       Ubiquity  was  formerly  known  as  "Espresso",  and originally as "Ubuntu Express", which is written and
       maintained  by  Javier   Carranza   &lt;<a href="mailto:javier.carranza@interactors.coop">javier.carranza@interactors.coop</a>&gt;   and   Juanje   Ojeda   Croissier
       &lt;<a href="mailto:juanje@interactors.coop">juanje@interactors.coop</a>&gt;.   This  version  draws  on the work done on Ubuntu Express, but was renamed to
       avoid confusion, to reduce awkward branding considerations, and because Ubiquity concentrates on  reusing
       <b>debian-installer</b>  code  and  reducing  duplicated  translation  and  branding  work  as much as possible.
       Ubiquity has now substantially diverged from Ubuntu Express and is an independent project.

       <b>ubiquity</b> was mainly developed by Colin Watson &lt;<a href="mailto:cjwatson@ubuntu.com">cjwatson@ubuntu.com</a>&gt;  and  Evan  Dandrea  &lt;<a href="mailto:ev@ubuntu.com">ev@ubuntu.com</a>&gt;,
       with contributions from many others.

       The <b>mythbuntu_ui</b> frontend was developed by Mario Limonciello &lt;<a href="mailto:superm1@ubuntu.com">superm1@ubuntu.com</a>&gt;.
