</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sg_seek - send SCSI SEEK, <a href="../man10/PRE-FETCH.10.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(10) or <a href="../man16/PRE-FETCH.16.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(16) command

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sg_seek</b> [<u>--10</u>] [<u>--count=NC</u>] [<u>--grpnum=GN</u>] [<u>--help</u>] [<u>--immed</u>] [<u>--lba=LBA</u>] [<u>--num-blocks=NUM</u>] [<u>--pre-fetch</u>]
       [<u>--readonly</u>] [<u>--skip=SB</u>] [<u>--time</u>] [<u>--verbose</u>] [<u>--version</u>] [<u>--wrap-offset=WO</u>] <u>DEVICE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sends  a  SCSI  <a href="../man10/SEEK.10.html">SEEK</a>(10), <a href="../man10/PRE-FETCH.10.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(10) or <a href="../man16/PRE-FETCH.16.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(16) command to the <u>DEVICE</u>. The SEEK command has been
       obsolete since SBC-2 (2005) but still is supported on some hard disks and even  some  SSDs  (solid  state
       disks).  The  PRE-FETCH  command  can  be  viewed as SEEK's modern replacement.  Instead of talking about
       moving the disk heads to the track containing the sort after LBA, it talks about bringing the sort  after
       LBA  (and  a  given  number  of  blocks) into the disk's cache. Also the PRE-FETCH commands have an IMMED
       field.

       The PRE-FETCH commands can report "real" errors but usually they will report one of two "good"  statuses.
       To do this they return the rarely used CONDITION MET status. If the number of blocks does actually fit in
       the  cache  (when  IMMED=0)  or there is enough room in the cache when the command arrives (when IMMED=1)
       then a CONDITION MET status is returned. If the requested number of blocks did not fit (IMMED=0) or would
       not fit (IMMED=1) then status GOOD is returned. So if a disk has a large  cache  and  PRE-FETCH  is  used
       sparingly  then  the  command  is  more likely to return CONDITION MET than GOOD. This presents some SCSI
       sub-systems with problems as due to its rareness they mishandle CONDITION MET and treat it  as  an  error
       (see NOTES section below).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--10</b>
              use  a  10  byte  cdb  command,  either  <a href="../man10/SEEK.10.html">SEEK</a>(10)  or <a href="../man10/PRE-FETCH.10.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(10) command. In the absence of the
              <u>--pre-fetch</u> option, the <a href="../man10/SEEK.10.html">SEEK</a>(10) command is used. If the <u>--pre-fetch</u> option is given without  this
              option then a <a href="../man16/PRE-FETCH.16.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(16) command is used.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--count</b>=<u>NC</u>
              <u>NC</u>  is  the  number  of  commands  (one  of <a href="../man10/SEEK.10.html">SEEK</a>(10), <a href="../man10/PRE-FETCH.10.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(10) or <a href="../man16/PRE-FETCH.16.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(16)) that will be
              executed. The default value is 1. If an error occurs it is noted and the program  continues  until
              <u>NC</u> is exhausted.  If <u>NC</u> is 0 then options are checked and the <u>DEVICE</u> is opened but no commands are
              sent.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--grpnum</b>=<u>GN</u>
              <u>GN</u>  is  the  group  number,  a value between 0 and 63 (in hex: 0x3f). The default value is 0. This
              option is ignored if the selected command is <a href="../man10/SEEK.10.html">SEEK</a>(10).

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              output the usage message then exit.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--immed</b>
              this option only applies to <a href="../man10/PRE-FETCH.10.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(10) and <a href="../man16/PRE-FETCH.16.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(16), setting the IMMED bit.  Without  this
              option,  the  <u>DEVICE</u>  returns  after  it has completed transferring all, or part of, the requested
              blocks into the cache. If this option is given the <u>DEVICE</u> returns after it has done sanity  checks
              on the cdb (e.g. making sure the <u>LBA</u> is greater than the number of available blocks) and before it
              does the transfer into the cache.
              Note  that  even when this option is given, the return status from the PRE-FETCH commands is still
              either CONDITION MET status (if the cache seems to have enough free space for the transfer)  or  a
              GOOD status (if the cache does not seem to have enough free space).

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--lba</b>=<u>LBA</u>
              <u>LBA</u>  is the starting logical block address that is placed in the command descriptor block (cdb) of
              the selected command. Note that the <u>LBA</u> field in <a href="../man10/SEEK.10.html">SEEK</a>(10) and <a href="../man10/PRE-FETCH.10.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(10) is a 32 bit  quantity,
              while with <a href="../man16/PRE-FETCH.16.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(16) it is a 64 bit quantity. The default value is 0 .

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--num-blocks</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              <u>NUM</u>  is  the  number of blocks, starting at and including <u>LBA</u>, to place in the <u>DEVICE</u>'s cache. The
              <a href="../man10/SEEK.10.html">SEEK</a>(10) command does not use the <u>NUM</u> value. For <a href="../man10/PRE-FETCH.10.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(10) <u>NUM</u> is a 16 bit quantity, while for
              <a href="../man16/PRE-FETCH.16.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(16) it is a 32 bit quantity. The default value is 1 . If <u>NUM</u> is 0 then the  <u>DEVICE</u>  will
              attempt to transfer all blocks from the given <u>LBA</u> to the end of the medium.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pre-fetch</b>
              this  option selects either <a href="../man10/PRE-FETCH.10.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(10) or <a href="../man16/PRE-FETCH.16.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(16) commands. With the <u>--10</u> also given, the
              <a href="../man10/PRE-FETCH.10.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(10) command is selected; without that option <a href="../man16/PRE-FETCH.16.html">PRE-FETCH</a>(16) is selected. The default  (in
              the absence of this and other 'selecting' options) the <a href="../man10/SEEK.10.html">SEEK</a>(10) command is selected.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--readonly</b>
              this  option  sets a 'read-only' flag when the underlying operating system opens the given <u>DEVICE</u>.
              This may not work since operating systems can not easily determine whether  a  pass-through  is  a
              logical  read  or  write  operation  so they take a risk averse stance and require read-write type
              <u>DEVICE</u> opens irrespective of what is performed by the pass-through.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--skip</b>=<u>SB</u>
              <u>SB</u> is the number of logical block addresses to skip, between repeated commands when <u>NC</u> is  greater
              than  1.  The  default value of <u>SB</u> is 1 . <u>SB</u> may be set to 0 so that all <u>NC</u> PRE-FETCH commands use
              the same <u>LBA</u>.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--time</b>
              if given the elapsed time to execute <u>NC</u> commands is recorded. This  is  printed  out  before  this
              utility exits. If <u>NC</u> is greater than 1 then the the "per command" time is also printed.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print the version string and then exit.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--wrap-offset</b>=<u>WO</u>
              <u>WO</u>  is  the  number of blocks, relative to <u>LBA</u>, that when exceeded, set the next command's logical
              block address back to <u>LBA</u>. Whether this "reset-to-LBA" action occurs depends on the values <u>NC</u>  and
              <u>SB</u>.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Prior  to  Linux kernel 4.17 the CONDITION MET status was logged as an error.  Recent versions of FreeBSD
       handle the CONDITION MET status properly.

       If either the <u>--count=NC</u> or <u>--verbose</u> option is given then a summary line like the following is output:

           Command count=5, number of condition_mets=3, number of goods=2

       before the utility exits.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_seek is 0 (GOOD) or 25 (CONDITION_MET) when this utility is successful. If multiple
       commands are executed (e.g. when <u>NC</u> is greater than 1) then the result  of  the  last  executed  SEEK  or
       PRE-FETCH command sets the exit status. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.
