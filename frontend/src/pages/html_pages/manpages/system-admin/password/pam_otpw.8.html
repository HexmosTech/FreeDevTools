</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pam_otpw - verify one-time passwords

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pam_otpw</b> [ <u>arguments</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>OTPW</u>  is a one-time password authentication system. It compares entered passwords with hash values stored
       in the user's home directory in the file <b><a href="file:~/.otpw">~/.otpw</a></b>.  Once a password was entered correctly, its hash  value
       in <b><a href="file:~/.otpw">~/.otpw</a></b> will be overwritten with hyphens, which disables its use in future authentication. A lock file
       <b><a href="file:~/.otpw.lock">~/.otpw.lock</a></b>  prevents  that  the  same password challenge is issued on several concurrent authentication
       sessions. This helps to prevent an eavesdropper from  copying  a  one-time  password  as  it  is  entered
       instantly  into a second session, in the hope to get access by sending the final newline character faster
       than the user could.

       Both an authentication management and a session management function  are  offered  by  this  module.  The
       authentication  function  asks for and verifies one-time passwords. The session function prints a message
       after login that reminds the user of the remaining number of one-time passwords.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       debug  Turn on debugging via <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a>(3)</b>.

       nolock Disable locking. This option tells the  authentication  function  of  <u>pam_otpw.so</u>  to  ignore  any
              existing  <b><a href="file:~/.otpw.lock">~/.otpw.lock</a></b> lock file and not to generate any. With this option, <u>pam_otpw.so</u> will never
              ask for several passwords simultaneously.

</pre><h4><b>PSEUDO-USER</b> <b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       If a system pseudo user “otpw” exists in the user database (with UID &lt;  1000),  then  the  password  hash
       files  will  not be stored in the user's home directory. Instead of looking for <b>~john/.otpw.lock</b> the file
       has to be located in the home directory of the pseudo user “otpw”, and be  named  after  the  user  (e.g.
       “/var/lib/otpw/john”). It will be accessed with the effective UID and GID of that pseudo user.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>OTPW</u> package, which includes the <u>otpw-gen</u> program, has been developed by Markus Kuhn. The most recent
       version is available from &lt;<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/otpw.html">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/otpw.html</a>&gt;.
