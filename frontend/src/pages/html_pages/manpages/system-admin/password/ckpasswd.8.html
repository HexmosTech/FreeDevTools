       ckpasswd - nnrpd password authenticator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ckpasswd</b> [<b>-gs</b>] [<b>-d</b> <u>database</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>] [<b>-u</b> <u>username</u> <b>-p</b> <u>password</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ckpasswd</b> is the basic password authenticator for <b>nnrpd</b>, suitable for being run from an auth stanza in
       <u>readers.conf</u>.  See <a href="../man5/readers.conf.5.html">readers.conf</a>(5) for more information on how to configure an <b>nnrpd</b> authenticator.

       <b>ckpasswd</b> accepts a username and password from <b>nnrpd</b> and tells <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8) whether that's the correct
       password for that username.  By default, when given no arguments, it tries to check the password using
       PAM if support for PAM was found when INN was built.  Failing that, it tries to check the password
       against the password field returned by <a href="../man3/getpwnam.3.html">getpwnam</a>(3).  Note that these days most systems no longer make
       real passwords available via <a href="../man3/getpwnam.3.html">getpwnam</a>(3) (some still do if and only if the program calling <a href="../man3/getpwnam.3.html">getpwnam</a>(3) is
       running as root).

       When using PAM, <b>ckpasswd</b> identifies itself as "nnrpd", not as "ckpasswd", and the PAM configuration must
       be set up accordingly.  The details of PAM configuration are different on different operating systems
       (and even different Linux distributions); see "EXAMPLES" below for help getting started, and look for a
       <a href="../man7/pam.7.html">pam</a>(7) or <a href="../man4/pam.conf.4.html">pam.conf</a>(4) manual page on your system.

       When using any method other than PAM, <b>ckpasswd</b> expects all passwords to be stored encrypted by the system
       <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt</a>(3) function and calls <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt</a>(3) on the supplied password before comparing it to the expected
       password.  Any password hashing algorithm supported by your libc or libcrypt can be used.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> <u>database</u>
           Read  passwords  from  a database (ndbm, gdbm or dbm format depending on what your system has) rather
           than by using <a href="../man3/getpwnam.3.html">getpwnam</a>(3).  <b>ckpasswd</b> expects <u>database</u>.dir and <u>database</u>.pag  to  exist  and  to  be  a
           database keyed by username with the encrypted passwords as the values.

           While INN doesn't come with a program intended specifically to create such databases, on most systems
           it's fairly easy to write a Perl script to do so.  Something like:

               #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>
               use NDBM_File;
               use Fcntl;
               tie (%db, 'NDBM_File', '/path/to/database', O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0640)
                   or die "Cannot open /path/to/database: $!\n";
               $| = 1;
               print "Username: ";
               my $user = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
               chomp $user;
               print "Password: ";
               my $passwd = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
               chomp $passwd;
               my @alphabet = ('.', '/', 0..9, 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z');
               my $salt = join '', @alphabet[rand 64, rand 64];
               $db{$user} = crypt ($passwd, $salt);
               untie %db;

           Note  that  this will echo back the password when typed; there are obvious improvements that could be
           made to this, but it should be a reasonable start.  Sometimes a program like this will  be  available
           with the name <b>dbmpasswd</b>.

           This option will not be available on systems without ndbm, gdbm or dbm libraries.

       <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>
           Read  passwords from the given file rather than using <a href="../man3/getpwnam.3.html">getpwnam</a>(3).  Each line of the file should look
           something like:

               username:$5$Hlb2yXPd$2nOO/QR9P1mnRFr/i6L9ybxbgSDXd4UlatKqbcY4eoB
               joe:FCjOJnpOo50IE:Old weak hash algorithm used for Joe

           Each line has at least two fields separated by a colon.  The first field contains the  username;  the
           second  field  contains a password hashed with the <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt</a>(3) function.  Additional colons and data may
           appear after the encrypted password; that data will be ignored by <b>ckpasswd</b>.  Lines  starting  with  a
           number sign ("#") are ignored.

           INN  does  not  come with a utility to create the encrypted passwords, but OpenSSL can do so and it's
           also a quick job with Perl (see the one-line example script below).

           A line in <u>filename</u> for the user "user" with the password "pass" would be "user:"  followed  with  the
           output of the following command using SHA-256 as hashing scheme:

               % openssl passwd -5 pass
               $5$UIhtJSBOaC0Ap3Vk$nbKgmykshoQ2HmvA3s/nI.X4uhhNHBKTYhBS3pYLjJ6

           See  the  <a href="../man1/openssl-passwd.1.html">openssl-passwd</a>(1)  man page for the list of hashing schemes it can generate.  You must take
           one that your system <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt</a>(3) function handles (type "man 3 crypt" or  "man  5  crypt"  to  find  the
           supported hashing schemes).

           In  case  OpenSSL  is not installed on your server, you can also use the following Perl command which
           does the same job with SHA-256 (see details below to set "YourSalt" to an appropriate value;  "5"  is
           the prefix for SHA-256, which does not expect any parameters):

               % perl -le 'print crypt("pass", q{$5$YourSalt$})'
               $5$YourSalt$V5hqwFg1nhKb5as6md9KTe5b2NyavsMS6dBYVKfp5W7

           As Perl makes use of <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt</a>(3), you have access to all available hashing schemes on your systems.  For
           instance,  if  yescript  is  supported,  you can generate an encrypted password with an argument like
           "$y$j9T$YourSalt$" to Perl crypt function, where "y" is the prefix for yescript, "j9T" the parameters
           passed to <a href="../man3/crypt_gensalt.3.html">crypt_gensalt</a>(3) to generate the hashed password (these  parameters  control  the  yescript
           configuration, and correspond in this example to the "YESCRYPT_DEFAULTS" flag, the recommended flavor
           which  has  "j"  value  in  2023,  with  cost factor of 4096 as block count and 32 as block size) and
           "YourSalt" a string which should be chosen at random and different for each  user.   The  syntax  and
           optimal  length  of  the salt depend on the hashing scheme (e.g. a length multiple of 4 for yescript)
           and cryptographic recommendations (e.g. at least 32 random bits in length, following NIST  SP 800-63B
           recommendations in 2023).

           To  put  it  in a nutshell, in the following command, you only have to change the password "pass" and
           the "YourSalt" random string, different for <b>each</b> user, and leave the rest of the command as-is:

               % perl -le 'print crypt("pass", q{$y$j9T$YourSalt$})'
               $y$j9T$YourSalt$X4tB48vKNDT6mK0vNOc7ppKPWvEsyMg5LwoQfO50r2A

           A random salt of 12 characters can be obtained with the following command (the result corresponds  to
           72 random bits as each character is selected in a 6-bit range of 64 possible characters):

               % perl -le 'print join("",
                     (".", "/", 0..9, A..Z, a..z)[map {rand 64} (1..12)])'
               k2W/17eJu58r

       <b>-g</b>  Attempt to look up system group corresponding to username and return a string like "user@group" to be
           matched against in <u>readers.conf</u>.  This option is incompatible with the <b>-d</b> and <b>-f</b> options.

       <b>-p</b> <u>password</u>
           Use  <u>password</u>  as  the  password  for  authentication  rather than reading a password using the <b>nnrpd</b>
           authenticator  protocol.   This  option  is  useful  only  for  testing  your  authentication  system
           (particularly  since  it  involves  putting  a  password on the command line), and does not work when
           <b>ckpasswd</b> is run by <b>nnrpd</b>.  If this option is given, <b>-u</b> must also be given.

       <b>-s</b>  Check passwords against the result of <a href="../man3/getspnam.3.html">getspnam</a>(3) instead of <a href="../man3/getpwnam.3.html">getpwnam</a>(3).  This  function,  on  those
           systems  that  supports  it, reads from <u><a href="file:/etc/shadow">/etc/shadow</a></u> or similar more restricted files.  If you want to
           check passwords supplied to <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8) against system account passwords, you will probably have to  use
           this option on most systems.

           Most  systems  require special privileges to call <a href="../man3/getspnam.3.html">getspnam</a>(3), so in order to use this option you may
           need to make <b>ckpasswd</b> setgid to some group (like group "shadow") or even setuid root.   <b>ckpasswd</b>  has
           not been specifically audited for such uses!  It is, however, a very small program that you should be
           able to check by hand for security.

           This  configuration  is  not  recommended  if  it  can be avoided, for serious security reasons.  See
           "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS" in <a href="../man5/readers.conf.5.html">readers.conf</a>(5) for discussion.

       <b>-u</b> <u>username</u>
           Authenticate as <u>username</u>.  This option is useful  only  for  testing  (so  that  you  can  test  your
           authentication  system  easily)  and  does not work when <b>ckpasswd</b> is run by <b>nnrpd</b>.  If this option is
           given, <b>-p</b> must also be given.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       See <a href="../man5/readers.conf.5.html">readers.conf</a>(5) for examples of <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8) authentication configuration that  uses  <b>ckpasswd</b>  to  check
       passwords.

       An  example  PAM  configuration  for  <u><a href="file:/etc/pam.conf">/etc/pam.conf</a></u>  that tells <b>ckpasswd</b> to check usernames and passwords
       against system accounts is:

           nnrpd auth    required pam_unix.so
           nnrpd account required pam_unix.so

       Your system may want you to instead create a file named <u>nnrpd</u> in <u><a href="file:/etc/pam.d">/etc/pam.d</a></u> with lines like:

           auth    required pam_unix.so
           account required pam_unix.so

       This is only the simplest configuration.  You may be able to include common shared  files,  and  you  may
       want  to  stack  other modules, either to allow different authentication methods or to apply restrictions
       like lists of users who can't authenticate using <b>ckpasswd</b>.  The best guide is the documentation for  your
       system and the other PAM configurations you're already using.

       To  test  to  make  sure that <b>ckpasswd</b> is working correctly, you can run it manually and then give it the
       username (prefixed with "ClientAuthname:") and password (prefixed  with  "ClientPassword:")  on  standard
       input.  For example:

           (echo 'ClientAuthname: test' ; echo 'ClientPassword: testing') \
               | ckpasswd -f /path/to/passwd/file

       will  check a username of "test" and a password of "testing" against the username and passwords stored in
       <u>/path/to/passwd/file</u>.  On success, <b>ckpasswd</b> will print "User:test" and exit with status "0".  On failure,
       it will print some sort of error message and exit a non-zero status.
