</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       checkpassword - check a password

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>checkpassword</b> <u>prog</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>checkpassword</b> reads descriptor 3 through end of file and then closes descriptor 3.  There must be at most
       512 bytes of data before end of file.

       The information supplied on descriptor 3 is a login name terminated by \0, a password terminated by \0, a
       timestamp  terminated  by \0, and possibly more data.  There are no other restrictions on the form of the
       login name, password, and timestamp.

       If the password is unacceptable, <b>checkpassword</b> exits 1.  If <b>checkpassword</b> is misused, it may instead exit
       2.  If there is a temporary problem checking the password, <b>checkpassword</b> exits 111.

       If the password is acceptable, <b>checkpassword</b> runs <u>prog</u>.  <u>prog</u> consists of one or more arguments.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBLE</b> <b>TOOLS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  other  tools  that  offer  the  same  interface  as  <b>checkpassword</b>.   Applications  that  use
       <b>checkpassword</b> are encouraged to take the <b>checkpassword</b> name as an argument, so that they can be used with
       different tools.

       Note  that  these  tools do not follow the <b><a href="../man3/getopt.3.html">getopt</a></b>(3) interface.  Optional features are controlled through
       (1) the tool name and (2) environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>PASSWORD</b> <b>DATABASE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>checkpassword</b> checks the login name and  password  against  <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u>,  using  the  operating  system's
       <b><a href="../man3/getpwnam.3.html">getpwnam</a></b>(3)  and <b><a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt</a></b>(3) functions, supplemented by <b>getspnam</b>.  It rejects accounts with empty passwords.
       It ignores the timestamp.

       Other <b>checkpassword</b>-compatible tools have  different  interpretations  of  login  names,  passwords,  and
       timestamps.  Both the login name and the password should be treated as secrets by the application calling
       <b>checkpassword</b>;  the only distinction is for administrative convenience.  The timestamp should include any
       other information that the password is based on; for  example,  the  challenge  in  a  challenge-response
       system such as APOP.

       <b>WARNING:</b>  <b>getpwnam</b>  is  inherently  unreliable.   It  fails  to  distinguish between temporary errors and
       nonexistent users.  Future versions of <b><a href="../man3/getpwnam.3.html">getpwnam</a></b>(3) should return ETXTBSY to indicate temporary errors and
       ESRCH to indicate nonexistent users.

</pre><h4><b>PROCESS-STATE</b> <b>CHANGES</b></h4><pre>
       Before invoking <u>prog</u>, <b>checkpassword</b> sets up <b>$USER</b>, <b>$HOME</b>, <b>$SHELL</b>, its supplementary groups, its gid,  its
       uid, and its working directory.

       Other  <b>checkpassword</b>-compatible tools may make different changes to the process state.  It is crucial for
       these effects to be documented; different applications have different requirements.
