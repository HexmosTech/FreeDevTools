</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       john - a tool to find weak passwords of your users

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>john</b> [<u>options</u>] password-files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly  the  <b>john</b>  command.   This manual page was written for the Debian
       GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  <b>john</b>, better  known  as
       John the Ripper, is a tool to find weak passwords of users in a server. John can use a dictionary or some
       search  pattern as well as a password file to check for passwords. John supports different cracking modes
       and understands many ciphertext formats, like several DES variants, MD5 and blowfish. It can also be used
       to extract AFS and Windows NT passwords.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       To use John, you just need to supply it a password file and the desired options. If no mode is specified,
       john will try "single" first, then "wordlist" and finally "incremental".

       Once John finds a  password,  it  will  be  printed  to  the  terminal  and  saved  into  a  file  called
       <a href="file:~/.john/john.pot.">~/.john/john.pot.</a>  John  will  read  this  file  when it restarts so it doesn't try to crack already done
       passwords.

       To see the cracked passwords, use

       john -show passwd

       Important: do this under the same directory where the password  was  cracked  (when  using  the  cronjob,
       /var/lib/john), otherwise it won't work.

       While  cracking,  you  can  press  any  key  for  status,  or  Ctrl+C  to abort the session, saving point
       information to a file ( <u><a href="file:~/.john/john.rec">~/.john/john.rec</a></u> by default). By the way, if you press  Ctrl+C  twice  John  will
       abort  immediately without saving.  The point information is also saved every 10 minutes (configurable in
       the configuration file, <u><a href="file:~/.john/john.ini">~/.john/john.ini</a></u> or <u><a href="file:~/.john/john.conf">~/.john/john.conf</a></u> ) in case of a crash.

       To continue an interrupted session, run:

       john -restore

       Now, you may notice that many accounts have a disabled shell, you can make John ignore these (assume that
       shell is called <u>/etc/expired</u> ):

       john -show -shells:-/etc/expired passwd

       You might want to mail all the users who got weak passwords, to tell them to change the  passwords.  It's
       not  always a good idea though (unfortunately, lots of people seem to ignore such mail, it can be used as
       a hint for crackers, etc), but anyway, I'll assume you know what you're doing. Get a copy of the 'mailer'
       script supplied with John, so you won't change anything that's under <u><a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a></u>  ;  edit  the  message  it
       sends,  and  possibly the mail command inside it (especially if the password file is from a different box
       than you got John running on).  Then run:

        ./mailer passwd

       Anyway, you probably should have a look at <u>/usr/share/doc/john/OPTIONS</u> for a list of all the command line
       options, and at <u>/usr/share/doc/john/EXAMPLES</u> for more John usage examples with other cracking modes.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All the options recognized by john start with a single dash (`-').  A  summary  of  options  is  included
       below.

       <b>-external:MODE</b>
              Enables  an  external  mode, using external functions defined in <a href="file:~/john.ini">~/john.ini</a>'s [List.External:MODE]
              section.

       <b>-format:NAME</b>
              Allows you to override the ciphertext format detection. Currently, valid  format  names  are  DES,
              BSDI,  MD5,  BF,  AFS,  LM.  You can use this option when cracking or with '-test'. Note that John
              can't crack password files with different ciphertext formats at the same time.

       <b>-groups:[-]GID[,..]</b>
              Tells John to load users of the specified group(s) only.

       <b>-incremental[:MODE]</b>
              Enables   the   incremental   mode,   using   the   specified   <a href="file:~/john.ini">~/john.ini</a>   definition   (section
              [Incremental:MODE], or [Incremental:All] by default).

       <b>-makechars:FILE</b>
              Generates  a  charset file, based on character frequencies from <a href="file:~/.john/john.pot">~/.john/john.pot</a>, for use with the
              incremental mode. The entire <a href="file:~/.john/john.pot">~/.john/john.pot</a> will be used for the charset file unless you specify
              some password files. You can also use an external filter() routine with this option.

       <b>-restore[:FILE]</b>
              Continues an interrupted cracking session, reading  point  information  from  the  specified  file
              (<a href="file:~/.john/john.rec">~/.john/john.rec</a> by default).

       <b>-rules</b> Enables  wordlist  rules,  that are read from [List.Rules:Wordlist] in <u>/etc/john/john.conf</u> (or the
              alternative configuration file you might specify on the command line).
              This option <b>requires</b> the <b>-wordlist</b> option to be passed as well.

       <b>-salts:[-]COUNT</b>
              This feature sometimes allows you to achieve better performance. For example you  can  crack  only
              some salts using '-salts:2' faster, and then crack the rest using '-salts:-2'. Total cracking time
              will be about the same, but you will get some passwords cracked earlier.

       <b>-savemem:LEVEL</b>
              You  might  need  this  option if you don't have enough memory, or don't want John to affect other
              processes too much. Level 1 tells John not to waste memory on login names, so you won't  see  them
              while  cracking.  Higher  levels  have  a performance impact: you should probably avoid using them
              unless John doesn't work or gets into swap otherwise.

       <b>-session:FILE</b>
              Allows you to specify another point information file's name to use for this cracking session. This
              is useful for running multiple instances of John in parallel, or just to be  able  to  recover  an
              older session later, not always continue the latest one.

       <b>-shells:[-]SHELL[,..]</b>
              This option is useful to load accounts with a valid shell only, or not to load accounts with a bad
              shell.  You can omit the path before a shell name, so '-shells:csh' will match both '/bin/csh' and
              '/usr/bin/csh', while '-shells:/bin/csh' will only match '/bin/csh'.

       <b>-show</b>  Shows the cracked passwords in a convenient form. You should also specify the password files.  You
              can use this option while another John is cracking, to see what it did so far.

       <b>-single</b>
              Enables the "single crack" mode, using rules from [List.Rules:Single].

       <b>-status[:FILE]</b>
              Prints  status  of an interrupted or running session. To get an up to date status information of a
              detached running session, send that copy of John a SIGHUP before using this option.

       <b>-stdin</b> These are used to enable the wordlist mode (reading from stdin).

       <b>-stdout[:LENGTH]</b>
              When used with a cracking mode, except for "single crack", makes John print the words it generates
              to stdout instead of cracking. While applying wordlist rules, the significant password  length  is
              assumed to be LENGTH, or unlimited by default.

       <b>-test</b>  Benchmarks all the enabled ciphertext format crackers, and tests them for correct operation at the
              same time.
              This  option  does  <b>not</b>  need  any  file passed as argument. Its only function is to benchmark the
              system john is running on.

       <b>-users:[-]LOGIN|UID[,..]</b>
              Allows you to filter a few accounts for cracking, etc. A dash before  the  list  can  be  used  to
              invert the check (that is, load all the users that aren't listed).

       <b>-wordlist:FILE</b>
              These are used to enable the wordlist mode, reading words from FILE.

</pre><h4><b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       John can work in the following modes:

       <b>Wordlist</b>
              John  will  simply use a file with a list of words that will be checked against the passwords. See
              RULES for the format of wordlist files.

       <b>Single</b> <b>crack</b>
              In this mode, john will try to crack the password using the login/GECOS information as passwords.

       <b>Incremental</b>
              This is the most powerful mode. John will try any character combination to resolve  the  password.
              Details about these modes can be found in the MODES file in john's documentation, including how to
              define your own cracking methods.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/john/john.conf</u>
              is where you configure how john will behave.

       <u>/etc/john/john-mail.msg</u>
              has the message sent to users when their passwords are successfully cracked.

       <u>/etc/john/john-mail.conf</u>
              is used to configure how john will send messages to users that had their passwords cracked.
