</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This utility, when <u>DEVICE</u> is given, sends a SCSI INQUIRY command to it then  outputs  the  response.  All
       SCSI  devices  are  meant to respond to a "standard" INQUIRY command with at least a 36 byte response (in
       SCSI 2 and higher). An INQUIRY is termed as "standard" when both the EVPD and CmdDt (now  obsolete)  bits
       are  clear. Formally (i.e. as per SPC stardards) the name of a standard INQUIRY response is the "standard
       INQUIRY data format" but here the "standard  INQUIRY  response"  is  used  as  it  is  shorter  and  more
       descriptive.

       Alternatively  the  <u>--inhex=FN</u> option can be given. In this case <u>FN</u> is assumed to be a file name ('-' for
       stdin) containing ASCII hexadecimal representing an INQUIRY response.

       This utility supports two command line syntaxes. The preferred one is shown first in the synopsis and  is
       described  in  the  main OPTIONS section. A later section titled OLDER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS describes the
       second group of options.

       An important "non-standard" INQUIRY page is the Device  Identification  Vital  Product  Data  (VPD)  page
       [0x83].  Since SPC-3, support for this page is mandatory. The <u>--id</u> option decodes this page. New VPD page
       information is no longer being added to this utility. The <a href="../man8/sg_vpd.8.html">sg_vpd</a>(8) utility is specialized  for  decoding
       VPD pages and shares code with this utility for that purpose. The <a href="../man8/sdparm.8.html">sdparm</a>(8) utility which is in a package
       of that name also decodes VPD pages although its major purpose is to access and modify SCSI mode pages.

       In Linux, if the <u>DEVICE</u> exists and the SCSI INQUIRY fails (e.g. because the SG_IO ioctl is not supported)
       then  an  ATA  IDENTIFY  (PACKET)  DEVICE is tried. If it succeeds then device identification strings are
       output. The <u>--raw</u> and <u>--hex</u> options can be used to manipulate the output.  If the <u>--ata</u> option  is  given
       then  the  SCSI  INQUIRY  is  not  performed  and  the  <u>DEVICE</u>  is assumed to be ATA (or ATAPI). For more
       information see the ATA DEVICES section below.

       In some operating systems a NVMe device (e.g. SSD) may be given as the <u>DEVICE</u>. For more  information  see
       the NVME DEVICES section below.

       The  reference  document used for interpreting an INQUIRY is T10/BSR INCITS 566 Revision 6 which is draft
       SPC-6 dated 22 October 2021. It can be found at https://www.t10.org .  Obsolete and reserved items in the
       standard INQUIRY response output are displayed in square brackets.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to long options are mandatory  for  short  options  as  well.   The  options  are  arranged  in
       alphabetical order based on the long option name.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--ata</b>
              Assume  given  <u>DEVICE</u>  is  an  ATA  or  ATAPI  device which can receive ATA commands from the host
              operating system. Skip the SCSI INQUIRY command and use either the  ATA  IDENTIFY  DEVICE  command
              (for  non-packet  devices) or the ATA IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE command. To show the response in hex,
              add a '--verbose' option. This option is only available in Linux.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--block</b>=<u>0|1</u>
              this option controls how the file handle to the <u>DEVICE</u> is opened. If this argument is 0  then  the
              open  is non-blocking. If the argument is 1 then the open is blocking. In Unix a non-blocking open
              is indicated by a O_NONBLOCK flag while a blocking open is indicated by the absence of that  flag.
              The  default  value  depends  on  the  operating  system  and  the  type of <u>DEVICE</u> node. For Linux
              pass-throughs (i.e. the sg and bsg drivers) the default is 0.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--cmddt</b>
              set the Command Support Data (CmdDt) bit (defaults to <a href="../man0/clear.0.html">clear</a>(0)).  Used  in  conjunction  with  the
              <u>--page=PG</u> option where <u>PG</u> specifies the SCSI command opcode to query. When used twice (e.g. '-cc')
              this  utility  forms a list by looping over all 256 opcodes (0 to 255 inclusive) only outputting a
              line for commands that are found. The CmdDt bit is now obsolete;  it  has  been  replaced  by  the
              REPORT SUPPORTED OPERATION CODES command, see the <a href="../man8/sg_opcodes.8.html">sg_opcodes</a>(8) utility.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--descriptors</b>
              decodes and prints the version descriptors found in a standard INQUIRY response. There are up to 8
              of  them.  Version  descriptors  indicate  which  versions  of  standards and/or drafts the <u>DEVICE</u>
              complies with. The normal components of a standard INQUIRY are output (typically from the first 36
              bytes of the response) followed by the version descriptors if any.

       <b>-e</b>     see entry below for <u>--vpd</u>.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
              As a sanity check, the normal action when fetching VPD pages other than page 0x0  (the  "Supported
              VPD  pages"  VPD  page),  is  to first fetch page 0x0 and only if the requested page is one of the
              supported pages, to go ahead and fetch the requested page.
              When this option is given, skip checking of VPD page 0x0 before accessing the requested VPD  page.
              The prior check of VPD page 0x0 is known to crash certain USB devices, so use with care.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--export</b>
              prints  out  information  obtained  from the device. The output can be modified by selecting a VPD
              page with <u>PG</u> (from <u>--page=PG</u>). If the device identification VPD page 0x83 is given it  prints  out
              information  in  the  form:  "SCSI_IDENT_&lt;assoc&gt;_&lt;type&gt;=&lt;ident&gt;"  to  stdout. If the device serial
              number VPD page 0x80 is given it prints out information in the form: "SCSI_SERIAL=&lt;ident&gt;".  Other
              VPD  pages  are  not  supported.  If  no  VPD page is given it prints out information in the form:
              "SCSI_VENDOR=&lt;vendor&gt;", "SCSI_MODEL=&lt;model&gt;", and "SCSI_REVISION=&lt;rev&gt;", taken from  the  standard
              inquiry. This may be useful for tools like <a href="../man7/udev.7.html">udev</a>(7) in Linux.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>-x</b>, <b>--extended</b>
              prints  the  extended  INQUIRY  VPD  page  [0x86].  It has the same effect as giving the <u>--page=ei</u>
              option.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              print out the usage message then exit. When used twice, after the usage message, there is  a  list
              of available abbreviations than can be given to the <u>--page=PG</u> option.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b>
              rather  than decode a standard INQUIRY response, a VPD page or command support data; print out the
              response in hex and send the output to stdout.  Error messages and warnings are  typically  output
              to  stderr.  When  used  twice  with  the ATA Information VPD page [0x89] decodes the start of the
              response then outputs the ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE response in hexadecimal bytes (not  16  bit
              words).  When  used three times with the ATA Information VPD page [0x89] or the <u>--ata</u> option, this
              utility outputs the ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE response in hexadecimal words suitable for  input
              to 'hdparm --Istdin'.  See note below.
              To  generate output suitable for placing in a file that can be used by a later invocation with the
              <u>--inhex=FN</u> option, use the '-HHHH' option (e.g. 'sg_inq -p di -HHHH /dev/sg3 &gt; dev_id.hex').

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--id</b>
              prints the device identification VPD page [0x83]. It has the same effect as giving  the  <u>--page=di</u>
              option.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--inhex</b>=<u>FN</u>
              <u>FN</u>  is  expected  to  be a file name (or '-' for stdin) which contains ASCII hexadecimal or binary
              representing an INQUIRY (including  VPD  page)  response.  This  utility  will  then  decode  that
              response.  It  is preferable to also supply the <u>--page=PG</u> option, if not this utility will attempt
              to guess which VPD  page  (or  standard  INQUIRY)  that  the  response  is  associated  with.  The
              hexadecimal should be arranged as 1 or 2 digits representing a byte each of which is whitespace or
              comma  separated.  Anything from and including a hash mark to the end of a line is ignored. If the
              <u>--raw</u> option is also given then <u>FN</u> is treated as binary.

       <b>-j</b>[=<u>JO</u>], <b>--json</b>[=<u>JO</u>]
              output is in JSON format instead of plain text form. Note that arguments to  the  short  and  long
              form  are  themselves optional and if present start with "=" and no whitespace is permitted around
              that "=".
              See sg3_utils_json manpage or use '?' for <u>JO</u> to get a summary.

       <b>-J</b>, <b>--js-file</b>=<u>JFN</u>
              output is in JSON format and it is sent to a file named <u>JFN</u>.  If  that  file  exists  then  it  is
              truncated. By default, the JSON output is sent to stdout.
              When  this  option  is  given,  the  <u>--json[=JO]</u>  option  is  implied  and  need not be given. The
              <u>--json[=JO]</u> option may still be needed to set the <u>JO</u> parameter to non-default values.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--len</b>=<u>LEN</u>
              the number <u>LEN</u> is the "allocation length" field in the INQUIRY cdb.  This is the (maximum)  length
              of  the  response  returned  by the device. The default value of <u>LEN</u> is 0 which is interpreted as:
              first request is for 36 bytes and if necessary execute another INQUIRY if the "additional  length"
              field in the response indicates that more than 36 bytes is available.
              If  <u>LEN</u>  is greater than 0 then only one INQUIRY command is performed.  This means that the Serial
              Number (obtained from the Serial Number VPD pgae (0x80)) is not fetched and therefore not printed.
              See the NOTES section below about "36 byte INQUIRYs".

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--long</b>
              this option causes more information to be decoded from the Identify command sent to a NVMe <u>DEVICE</u>.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--maxlen</b>=<u>LEN</u>
              this option has the same action as the <u>--len=LEN</u> option above. It has been added for compatibility
              with the sg_vpd, sg_modes and sg_logs utilities.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--old</b>
              Switch to older style options. Please use as first option on the command line.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--only</b>
              Do not attempt to additionally retrieve the serial number VPD page (0x80) to enhance the output of
              a standard INQUIRY. So with this option given and no others, this utility  will  send  a  standard
              INQUIRY  SCSI  command and decode its response. No other SCSI commands will be sent to the <u>DEVICE</u>.
              Without this option an additional SCSI command is sent: a (non-standard) SCSI INQUIRY to fetch the
              Serial Number VPD page. However the Serial Number VPD page is  not  mandatory  (while  the  Device
              Identification  page is mandatory but a billion USB keys ignore that) and may cause nuisance error
              reports. In most cases if the <u>--maxlen=LEN</u> option is given and <u>LEN</u> is greater  than  0  then  this
              option is not needed.
              For  NVMe  devices  only  the  Identify  controller  is  performed,  even if the <u>DEVICE</u> includes a
              namespace identifier. For example in FreeBSD given a <u>DEVICE</u> named /dev/nvme0ns1 then  an  Identify
              controller is sent to /dev/nvme0 and nothing is sent to its "ns1" (first namespace).

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--page</b>=<u>PG</u>
              the  <u>PG</u>  argument  can  be  either  a  number  of an abbreviation for a VPD page. To enumerate the
              available abbreviations for VPD pages use '-hh' or a bad abbreviation  (e.g,  '--page=xxx').  When
              the  <u>--cmddt</u>  option  is  given  (once)  then  <u>PG</u>  is interpreted as an opcode number (so VPD page
              abbreviations make little sense).
              If <u>PG</u> is a negative number, then a standard INQUIRY is performed. This can  be  used  to  override
              some guessing logic associated with the <u>--inhex=FN</u> option.
              If  <u>PG</u>  is  not found in the 'Supported VPD pages' VPD page (0x0) then EDOM is returned. To bypass
              this check use the <u>--force</u> option.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              suppress the amount of decoding and error output.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>
              in the absence of <u>--inhex=FN</u> then the output response is in binary.  The output should be piped to
              a file or another utility when this option is used. The binary is sent to stdout, and  errors  are
              sent to stderr.
              If used with <u>--inhex=FN</u> then the contents of <u>FN</u> is treated as binary.

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--sinq_inraw</b>=<u>RFN</u>
              where  <u>RFN</u>  is  a  filename  containing  binary standard INQUIRY response data that matches either
              <u>DEVICE</u> or <u>FN</u>. Linux places this standard INQUIRY  response  in  its  sysfs  pseudo  filesystem.  A
              typical  location  is  at <a href="file:/sys/class/scsi_device/">/sys/class/scsi_device/</a>&lt;hctl&gt;/device/inquiry where &lt;hctl&gt; is a four part
              numeric tuple separated by colons. This tuple distinguishes the device  from  any  others  on  the
              system.  Linux also places some VPD page responses in binary in the same directory with names like
              "vpd_pg83" where the last two digits form the hexadecimal VPD page number  whose  binary  contents
              are therein.
              Some VPD pages (e.g. the Extended Inquiry VPD page) depend on knowing the settings in the standard
              INQUIRY  response  to  interpret the fields in that VPD page. This option together with the <u>--all</u>,
              <u>--examine</u> or <u>--page=PG</u> allows this utility to process both the standard INQUIRY response  and  VPD
              pages in the same invocation.
              The <u>--raw</u> option has no effect on this option. The <u>DEVICE</u> argument may be given with this option.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--vendor</b>
              output  a  standard  INQUIRY response's vendor specific fields from offset 36 to 55 in ASCII. When
              used twice (i.e. '-ss') also output the vendor specific field from offset 96  in  ASCII.  This  is
              only done if the data passes some simple sanity checks.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase level of verbosity. Can be used multiple times.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print out version string then exit.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--vpd</b>
              set  the Enable Vital Product Data (EVPD) bit (defaults to <a href="../man0/clear.0.html">clear</a>(0)). Used in conjunction with the
              <u>--page=PG</u> option where <u>PG</u> specifies the VPD page number to query. If the <u>--page=PG</u>  is  not  given
              then <u>PG</u> defaults to zero which is the "Supported VPD pages" VPD page.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Some  devices  with  weak  SCSI command set implementations lock up when they receive commands they don't
       understand (and some lock up if they receive response lengths that they don't expect). Such devices  need
       to  be  treated  carefully,  use  the  '--len=36'  option. Without this option this utility will issue an
       initial standard INQUIRY requesting 36 bytes of response data. If the  device  indicates  it  could  have
       supplied  more data then a second INQUIRY is issued to fetch the longer response. That second command may
       lock up faulty devices.

       ATA or ATAPI devices that use a SCSI to ATA Translation layer (see SAT at www.t10.org)  may  support  the
       SCSI  ATA  INFORMATION VPD page. This returns the IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE response amongst other things.
       The ATA Information VPD page can be fetched with '--page=ai'.

       In the INQUIRY standard response there is a 'MultiP' flag which is set when the  device  has  2  or  more
       ports. Some vendors use the preceding vendor specific ('VS') bit to indicate which port is being accessed
       by  the  INQUIRY  command  (0  -&gt;  relative port 1 (port "a"), 1 -&gt; relative port 2 (port "b")). When the
       'MultiP' flag is set, the preceding vendor specific bit is shown in parentheses. SPC-3 compliant  devices
       should  use the device identification VPD page (0x83) to show which port is being used for access and the
       SCSI ports VPD page (0x88) to show all available ports on the device.

       In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the <u>DEVICE</u> must be a SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6  series  and
       later  block  devices  (e.g.   disks and ATAPI DVDs) can also be specified. For example "sg_inq /dev/sda"
       will work in the 2.6 series kernels. From lk 2.6.6 other SCSI "char" device names may  be  used  as  well
       (e.g. "/dev/st0m").

       The  number  of  bytes  output  by  <u>--hex</u>  and  <u>--raw</u>  is  36  bytes or the number given to <u>--len=LEN</u> (or
       <u>--maxlen=LEN</u>). That number is reduced if the "resid" returned by the HBA indicates less bytes  were  sent
       back from <u>DEVICE</u>.

       The <u>DEVICE</u> is opened with a read-only flag (e.g. in Unix with the O_RDONLY flag).

</pre><h4><b>ATA</b> <b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       There are two major types of ATA devices: non-packet devices (e.g. ATA disks) and packet devices (ATAPI).
       The majority of ATAPI devices are CD/DVD/BD drives in which the ATAPI transport carries the MMC set (i.e.
       a  SCSI command set). Further, both types of ATA devices can be connected to a host computer via a "SCSI"
       (or some other) transport. When an ATA disk is controlled via a SCSI  (or  non-ATA)  transport  then  two
       approaches  are commonly used: tunnelling (e.g. STP in Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)) or by emulating a SCSI
       device (e.g. with a SCSI to ATA translation layer, see SAT at  www.t10.org  ).  Even  when  the  physical
       transport to the host computer is ATA (especially in the case of SATA) the operating system may choose to
       put a SAT layer in the driver "stack" (e.g. libata in Linux).

       The  main  identifying  command  for  any SCSI device is an INQUIRY. The corresponding command for an ATA
       non-packet device is IDENTIFY DEVICE while for an ATA packet device it is IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE.

       When this utility is invoked for an ATAPI device (e.g. a CD/DVD/BD drive with "sg_inq /dev/hdc")  then  a
       SCSI  INQUIRY  is  sent to the device and if it responds then the response to decoded and output and this
       utility exits. To see the response for an ATA IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE command add the <u>--ata</u>  option  (e.g.
       "sg_inq --ata /dev/hdc).

       This  utility  doesn't decode the response to an ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE command, hdparm does a good
       job at that. The '-HHH' option has been added for use with either the '--ata' or  '--page=ai'  option  to
       produce  a  format  acceptable  to  "hdparm  --Istdin".  An example: 'sg_inq --ata -HHH /dev/hdc | hdparm
       --Istdin'. See hdparm.

</pre><h4><b>NVME</b> <b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       Currently these device are typically SSDs (Solid State Disks) directly connected to a PCIe  connector  or
       via  a  specialized  connector  such  as  a M2 connector. Linux and FreeBSD treat NVMe storage devices as
       separate from SCSI storage with device names like /dev/nvme0n1 (in Linux) and /dev/nvme0ns1 (in FreeBSD).
       The NVM Express group has a document titled "NVM Express: SCSI Translation  Reference"  which  defines  a
       partial "SCSI to NVMe Translation Layer" often known by its acronym: SNTL.

       On operating systems where it is supported by this package, this utility will detect NVMe storage devices
       directly  connected  and  send  an Identify controller NVMe Admin command and decode its response. A NVMe
       controller is architecturally similar to a SCSI target device. If the NVMe <u>DEVICE</u> indicates  a  namespace
       then  an  Identify  namespace  NVMe  Admin command is sent to that namespace and its response is decoded.
       Namespaces are numbered sequentially starting from 1. Namespaces are similar to SCSI  Logical  Units  and
       their  identifiers (nsid_s) can be thought of as SCSI LUNs. In the Linux and FreeBSD example device names
       above the "n1" and the "ns1" parts indicate nsid 1 . If no namespace is given  in  the  <u>DEVICE</u>  then  all
       namespaces found in the controller are sent Identify namespace commands and the responses are decoded.

       To  get more details in the response use the <u>--long</u> option. To only get the controller's Identify decoded
       use the <u>--only</u> option.

       It is possible that even though the <u>DEVICE</u> presents as a NVMe device, it has  a  SNTL  and  accepts  SCSI
       commands.  In  this  case  to  send  a  SCSI  INQUIRY command (and fetch its VPD pages) use the <a href="../man8/sg_vpd.8.html">sg_vpd</a>(8)
       utility.

</pre><h4><b>SG_INQ</b> <b>and</b> <b>SG_VPD</b></h4><pre>
       Both these utilities have much in common since VPD pages are fetched with the SCSI  INQUIRY  command.  As
       more  VPD  pages  have  been  added  (and  existing pages expanded) the newer ones were only decoded with
       sg_vpd. Recently with the optional JSON output work, it was decided to place all VPD page decoding  in  a
       source file called sg_vpd_common.c that is linked in by both sg_inq and sg_vpd.

       This  means  that  the  VPD  page decoding capabilities of both sg_inq and sg_vpd will be the same. Their
       default actions remain as they were, namely when sg_inq is used without command line options, it  decodes
       the  "standard  INQUIRY data format" (usually called the "standard INQUIRY response") response while when
       sg_vpd is used without options, it decodes the "Supported VPD pages" VPD page.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_inq is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

</pre><h4><b>OLDER</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options in this section were the only ones available prior to sg3_utils version  1.23  .  Since  then
       this utility defaults to the newer command line options which can be overridden by using <u>--old</u> (or <u>-O</u>) as
       the  first  option. See the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section for another way to force the use of these older
       command line options.

       <b>-36</b>    only requests 36 bytes of response data for an INQUIRY. Furthermore even if the  device  indicates
              in  its  response  it  can supply more data, a second (longer) INQUIRY is not performed. This is a
              paranoid setting.  Equivalent to '--len=36' in the OPTIONS section.

       <b>-a</b>     fetch the ATA Information VPD page [0x89]. Equivalent to '--page=ai' in the OPTIONS section.  This
              page is defined in SAT (see at www.t10.org).

       <b>-A</b>     Assume given <u>DEVICE</u> is an ATA or ATAPI device.  Equivalent to <u>--ata</u> in the OPTIONS section.

       <b>-b</b>     decodes  the Block Limits VPD page [0xb0].  Equivalent to '--page=bl' in the OPTIONS section. This
              page is defined in SBC-2 (see www.t10.org) and later.

       <b>-B</b>=<u>0|1</u> equivalent to <u>--block=0|1</u> in OPTIONS section.

       <b>-c</b>     set the Command Support Data (CmdDt) bit (defaults to <a href="../man0/clear.0.html">clear</a>(0)).  Used  in  conjunction  with  the
              <u>-p=VPD_PG</u> option to specify the SCSI command opcode to query. Equivalent to <u>--cmddt</u> in the OPTIONS
              section.

       <b>-cl</b>    lists  the  command  data  for  all  supported  commands (followed by the command name) by looping
              through all 256 opcodes.  This  option  uses  the  CmdDt  bit  which  is  now  obsolete.  See  the
              <a href="../man8/sg_opcodes.8.html">sg_opcodes</a>(8) utility.  Equivalent to '--cmddt --cmddt' in the OPTIONS section.

       <b>-d</b>     decodes  depending  on context. If <u>-e</u> option is given, or any option that implies <u>-e</u> (e.g. '-i' or
              '-p=80'), then this utility attempts to decode the indicated  VPD  page.   Otherwise  the  version
              descriptors  (if any) are listed following a standard INQUIRY response. In the version descriptors
              sense, equivalent to <u>--descriptors</u> in the OPTIONS section.

       <b>-e</b>     enable (i.e. sets) the Vital Product Data (EVPD) bit (defaults to <a href="../man0/clear.0.html">clear</a>(0)).  Used in  conjunction
              with  the  <u>-p=VPD_PG</u>  option  to specify the VPD page to fetch. If <u>-p=VPD_PG</u> is not given then VPD
              page 0 (list supported VPD pages) is assumed.

       <b>-f</b>     Equivalent to <u>--force</u> in the OPTIONS section.

       <b>-h</b>     outputs INQUIRY response in hex rather than trying to decode  it.   Equivalent  to  <u>--hex</u>  in  the
              OPTIONS section.

       <b>-H</b>     same action as <u>-h</u>.  Equivalent to <u>--hex</u> in the OPTIONS section.

       <b>-i</b>     decodes the Device Identification VPD page [0x83]. Equivalent to <u>--id</u> in the OPTIONS section. This
              page  is  made up of several "designation descriptors". If <u>-h</u> is given then each descriptor header
              is decoded and the identifier itself is output in hex. To see the whole VPD 0x83 page response  in
              hex use '-p=83 -h'.

       <b>-I</b>=<u>FN</u>  equivalent to <u>--inhex=FN</u> in the OPTIONS section.

       <b>-j[</b>=<u>JO]</u>
              equivalent to <u>--json[=JO]</u> in the OPTIONS section.

       <b>-l</b>=<u>LEN</u> equivalent to <u>--len=LEN</u> in the OPTIONS section.

       <b>-L</b>     equivalent to <u>--long</u> in the OPTIONS section.

       <b>-m</b>     decodes  the  Management  network  addresses  VPD  page  [0x85]. Equivalent to '--page=mna' in the
              OPTIONS section.

       <b>-M</b>     decodes the Mode page policy VPD page [0x87].  Equivalent to '--page=mpp' in the OPTIONS section.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--new</b>
              Switch to the newer style options.

       <b>-o</b>     equivalent to <u>--only</u> in the OPTIONS section.

       <b>-p</b>=<u>VPD_PG</u>
              used in conjunction with the <u>-e</u> or <u>-c</u> option. If neither given then the <u>-e</u>  option  assumed.  When
              the  <u>-e</u> option is also given (or assumed) then the argument to this option is the VPD page number.
              The argument is interpreted as hexadecimal and is expected to be in the range 0 to  ff  inclusive.
              Only  VPD page 0 is decoded and it lists supported VPD pages and their names (if known). To decode
              the mandatory device identification page (0x83) use the <u>-i</u> option. A now obsolete  usage  is  when
              the <u>-c</u> option is given in which case the argument to this option is assumed to be a command opcode
              number.  Recent  SCSI  draft  standards  have  moved  this  facility  to  a  separate command (see
              <a href="../man8/sg_opcodes.8.html">sg_opcodes</a>(8)). Defaults to 0 so if <u>-e</u> is given without this option then VPD page 0 is output.

       <b>-P</b>     decodes the Unit Path Report VPD page [0xc0] which is EMC specific.  Equivalent to '--page=upr' in
              the OPTIONS section.

       <b>-r</b>     outputs the response in binary to stdout.  Equivalent to <u>--raw</u> in the  OPTIONS  section.   Can  be
              used  twice  (i.e. '-rr' (and '-HHH' has same effect)) and if used with the <u>-A</u> or <u>-a</u> option yields
              output with the same format as "cat /proc/ide/hd&lt;x&gt;/identify" so that it  can  then  be  piped  to
              "hdparm --Istdin".

       <b>-s</b>     decodes the SCSI Ports VPD page [0x88].  Equivalent to '--page=sp' in the OPTIONS section.

       <b>-u</b>     equivalent to '--export' in the OPTIONS section.

       <b>-v</b>     increase level of verbosity. Can be used multiple times.

       <b>-V</b>     print out version string then exit.

       <b>-x</b>     decodes  the  Extended  INQUIRY  data  VPD  [0x86] page.  Equivalent to '--page=ei' in the OPTIONS
              section.

       <b>-?</b>     output usage message and exit. Ignore all other parameters.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The examples in this page use Linux device names. For suitable device names in other supported  Operating
       Systems see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

       To view the standard inquiry response use without options:

          sg_inq /dev/sda

       Some  SCSI  devices  include  version  descriptors  indicating the various SCSI standards and drafts they
       support. They can be viewed with:

          sg_inq -d /dev/sda

       Modern SCSI devices include Vital Product Data (VPD)pages which can  be  viewed  with  the  SCSI  INQUIRY
       command. To list the supported VPD pages (but not their contents) try:

          sg_inq -e /dev/sda

       In  Linux,  binary  images of some important VPD page responses (e.g. 0, 80h and 83h) are cached in files
       within the sysfs pseudo file system. Since VPD pages hardly ever change their  contents,  decoding  those
       files  will  give  the same output as probing the device with the added benefit that decoding those files
       doesn't need root permissions. If /dev/sg3 is a disk at 2:0:0:0 , then  these  three  invocations  should
       result in the same output:

          sg_inq --raw --inhex=/sys/class/scsi_generic/sg3/device/vpd_pg83

          sg_inq -rI /sys/class/scsi_generic/sg3/device/vpd_pg83

          sg_inq -r -I /sys/class/scsi_disk/2:0:0:0/device/vpd_pg83

       Without  the  <u>--raw</u>  option,  the  <u>--inhex=FN</u>  option  would  expect  the  contents  of those files to be
       hexadecimal. vpd_pg83 contains the response (in binary) to the Device Identification VPD page whose  page
       number is 83h (i.e. hexadecimal).

       Some  VPD  pages  can  be  read  with the sg_inq utility but a newer utility called sg_vpd specializes in
       showing their contents. The sdparm utility can also be used to show the contents of VPD pages.

       Further   examples   of   sg_inq   together   with   some   typical    output    can    be    found    on
       https://sg.danny.cz/sg/sg3_utils.html web page.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Since sg3_utils version 1.23 the environment variable SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS can be given. When it is present
       this  utility will expect the older command line options. So the presence of this environment variable is
       equivalent to using <u>--old</u> (or <u>-O</u>) as the first command line option.
