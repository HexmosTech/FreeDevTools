</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Copy  data  to  and  from any files. Specialized for "files" that are Linux SCSI devices that support the
       SCSI EXTENDED COPY (XCOPY) command.

       This utility has similar syntax and semantics to <b><a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a>(1)</b> but with no "conversions" is supported.

       The first group in the synopsis above are "standard" Unix <b><a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a>(1)</b> operands.  The  second  group  are  extra
       options added by this utility.  Both groups are defined below in combined, alphabetical order.

       By  default  the  XCOPY  command  is  sent to <u>OFILE</u>. This can be changed with the <u>--on_src</u> or <u>iflag=xflag</u>
       options which cause the XCOPY command to be sent to <u>IFILE</u> instead. Also see the  section  on  ENVIRONMENT
       VARIABLES.

       In  the  SPC-4 standard the T10 committee has expanded the XCOPY command so that it now has two variants:
       "LID1" (for a List Identifier length of 1 byte) and "LID4" (for a List Identifier  length  of  4  bytes).
       This  utility  supports  the older, LID1 variant which is also found in SPC-3 and earlier. While the LID1
       variant in SPC-4 is command level (binary) compatible with XCOPY as defined in SPC-3, some of the command
       naming has changed. This utility uses the older, SPC-3 XCOPY names.

       The ddpt utility supports the same xcopy(LID1) functionality as this utility with the  same  options  and
       flags.  Additionally  ddpt supports a subset of xcopy(LID4) functionality variously called "xcopy version
       2, lite" or ODX.  ODX is a market name and stands for Offloaded Data Xfer (i.e. transfer).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>app</b>={0|1}
              if 1 start the destination of the copy at the end of OFILE. This assumes that OFILE is  a  regular
              file.  The default is 0 in which case the destination of the copy starts at the beginning of OFILE
              (possibly offset be SEEK). This option cannot be used with the <u>seek=SEEK</u> option.

       <b>bpt</b>=<u>BPT</u>
              each IO transaction will be made using <u>BPT</u> blocks (or less if near the end of the  copy).  Default
              is  128  for  logical block sizes less that 2048 bytes, otherwise the default is 32. So for bs=512
              the reads and writes will each convey 64 KiB of data by default (less  if  near  the  end  of  the
              transfer  or  memory  restrictions).  When  cd/dvd  drives are accessed, the logical block size is
              typically 2048 bytes and bpt defaults to 32 which again implies 64 KiB transfers.

       <b>bs</b>=<u>BS</u>  where <u>BS</u> <b>must</b> be the logical block size of the physical device (if  either  the  input  or  output
              files are accessed via SCSI commands). Note that this differs from <b><a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a>(1)</b> which permits <u>BS</u> to be an
              integral multiple. Defaults to the device logical block size.

       <b>cat</b>={0|1}
              sets the SCSI EXTENDED COPY command segment descriptor CAT bit to 0 or 1 (default: 0). The CAT bit
              (in  conjunction with the PAD bit) controls the handling of residual data. See section <b>HANDLING</b> <b>OF</b>
              <b>RESIDUAL</b> <b>DATA</b> for details.

       <b>conv</b>=<b>CONV</b>
              all <b>CONV</b> arguments are ignored.

       <b>count</b>=<u>COUNT</u>
              copy <u>COUNT</u> blocks from <u>IFILE</u> to <u>OFILE</u>. Default is the minimum (<u>IFILE</u> if <u>dc=0</u>  or  <u>OFILE</u>  if  <u>dc=1</u>)
              number  of  blocks that SCSI devices report from SCSI READ CAPACITY commands or that block devices
              (or their partitions) report. Normal files  are  not  probed  for  their  size.  If  <u>skip=SKIP</u>  or
              <u>seek=SEEK</u> are given and the count is derived (i.e. not explicitly given) then the derived count is
              scaled  back  so  that  the  copy  will not overrun the device. If the file name is a block device
              partition and <u>COUNT</u> is not given then the size of the partition rather than the size of the  whole
              device is used. If <u>COUNT</u> is not given (or <u>count=-1</u>) and cannot be derived then an error message is
              issued and no copy takes place.

       <b>dc</b>={0|1}
              sets  the  SCSI EXTENDED COPY command segment descriptor DC bit to 0 or 1 (default: 0). The DC bit
              controls whether <u>COUNT</u> refers to the source (<u>dc=0</u>) or the target (<u>dc=1</u>) descriptor.

       <b>fco</b>={0|1}
              sets the SCSI EXTENDED COPY command segment descriptor FCO bit to 0 or 1 (default:  0).  The  Fast
              Copy  Only  (FCO) bit set will result in the copy being done but a technique faster than SCSI READ
              and WRITE commands.  If the copy cannot but done in a faster manner then  a  sense  key  of  "Copy
              aborted" with and additional sense of "Fast copy not possible" is returned.

       <b>ibs</b>=<u>BS</u> if given must be the same as <u>BS</u> given to 'bs=' option.

       <b>id_usage</b>={hold|discard|disable}
              sets the SCSI EXTENDED COPY command parameter list field called LIST ID USAGE to 0 if the argument
              is 'hold', to 2 if the argument is 'discard', or to '3' if the argument is 'disable'.
              If  the  device has the ability to hold data (as indicated by "held data limit" being greater than
              zero) then <u>id_usage</u> defaults to 'hold' otherwise it defaults to 'discard'.

       <b>if</b>=<u>IFILE</u>
              read from <u>IFILE</u> instead of stdin. If <u>IFILE</u> is '-' then  stdin  is  read.  Starts  reading  at  the
              beginning of <u>IFILE</u> unless <u>SKIP</u> is given.

       <b>iflag</b>=<u>FLAGS</u>
              where  <u>FLAGS</u>  is  a  comma  separated  list  of one or more flags outlined below.  These flags are
              associated with <u>IFILE</u> and are ignored when <u>IFILE</u> is stdin.

       <b>list_id</b>=<u>ID</u>
              sets the SCSI EXTENDED COPY command parameter list field called LIST IDENTIFIER to <u>ID</u>.  <u>ID</u>  should
              be  a  value  between  0  and 255 (inclusive). <u>ID</u> usually defaults to 1 unless <u>id_usage=disable</u> in
              which case it defaults to 0.

       <b>obs</b>=<u>BS</u> if given must be the same as <u>BS</u> given to 'bs=' option.

       <b>of</b>=<u>OFILE</u>
              write to <u>OFILE</u> instead of stdout. If <u>OFILE</u> is '-' then writes to stdout.  If  <u>OFILE</u>  is  /dev/null
              then  no actual writes are performed.  If <u>OFILE</u> is '.' (period) then it is treated the same way as
              /dev/null (this is a shorthand notation). If <u>OFILE</u> exists  then  it  is  _not_  truncated;  it  is
              overwritten from the start of <u>OFILE</u> unless 'oflag=append' or <u>SEEK</u> is given.

       <b>oflag</b>=<u>FLAGS</u>
              where  <u>FLAGS</u>  is  a  comma  separated  list  of one or more flags outlined below.  These flags are
              associated with <u>OFILE</u> and are ignored when <u>OFILE</u> is /dev/null, '.' (period), or stdout.

       <b>prio</b>=<u>PRIO</u>
              sets the SCSI EXTENDED COPY command parameter list field called PRIORITY  to  <u>PRIO</u>.   The  default
              value is 1.

       <b>seek</b>=<u>SEEK</u>
              start  writing  <u>SEEK</u>  bs-sized  blocks from the start of <u>OFILE</u>.  Default is block 0 (i.e. start of
              file).

       <b>skip</b>=<u>SKIP</u>
              start reading <u>SKIP</u> bs-sized blocks from the start of <u>IFILE</u>.  Default is block  0  (i.e.  start  of
              file).

       <b>time</b>={0|1}
              when  1,  times  transfer  and  does throughput calculation, outputting the results (to stderr) at
              completion. When 0 (default) doesn't perform timing.

       <b>verbose</b>=<u>VERB</u>
              as <u>VERB</u> increases so does the amount of debug output sent to stderr.  Default value is zero  which
              yields  the  minimum  amount  of debug output.  A value of 1 reports extra information that is not
              repetitive. A value 2 reports cdbs and responses for SCSI commands that are not  repetitive  (i.e.
              other that READ and WRITE). Error processing is not considered repetitive. Values of 3 and 4 yield
              output for all SCSI commands (and Unix read() and write() calls) so there can be a lot of output.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              outputs usage message and exits.

       <b>--on_dst</b>
              send  the  XCOPY  command  to  the  output  file/device  (i.e.  <u>OFILE</u>). This is the default unless
              overridden by the <u>--on_src</u> or <u>iflag=xflag</u> options. Also  see  the  section  below  on  ENVIRONMENT
              VARIABLES.

       <b>--on_src</b>
              send the XCOPY command to the input file/device (i.e. <u>IFILE</u>).

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              equivalent to <u>verbose=1</u>. When used twice, equivalent to <u>verbose=2</u>, etc.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              outputs version number information and exits.

</pre><h4><b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a list of flags and their meanings:

       append causes  the  O_APPEND  flag  to be added to the open of <u>OFILE</u>. For regular files this will lead to
              data appended to the end of any existing data.  Cannot be used together with the <u>seek=SEEK</u>  option
              as  they  conflict.  The default action of this utility is to overwrite any existing data from the
              beginning of the file or, if <u>SEEK</u> is given, starting  at  block  <u>SEEK</u>.  Note  that  attempting  to
              'append'  to  a  device  file  (e.g.   a disk) will usually be ignored or may cause an error to be
              reported.

       excl   causes the O_EXCL flag to be added to the open of <u>IFILE</u> and/or <u>OFILE</u>.

       flock  after opening the associated file (i.e. <u>IFILE</u> and/or <u>OFILE</u>) an attempt is made to get an  advisory
              exclusive  lock  with the flock() system call. The flock arguments are "FLOCK_EX | FLOCK_NB" which
              will cause the lock to be taken if available else a "temporarily unavailable" error is  generated.
              An exit status of 90 is produced in the latter case and no copy is done.

       null   has no affect, just a placeholder.

       pad    sets  the  SCSI EXTENDED COPY command segment descriptor PAD bit. The PAD bit (in conjunction with
              the CAT bit) controls the handling of residual data.(See section <b>HANDLING</b>  <b>OF</b>  <b>RESIDUAL</b>  <b>DATA</b>  for
              details.

       xcopy  has no affect; for compatibility with ddpt.

</pre><h4><b>HANDLING</b> <b>OF</b> <b>RESIDUAL</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>pad</u> and <u>cat</u> bits control the handling of residual data. As the data can be specified either in terms
       of source or target logical block size and both might have different block sizes residual data is  likely
       to  happen  in  these  cases.   If  both  logical  block sizes are identical these bits have no effect as
       residual data will not occur.

       If none of these bits are  set,  the  EXTENDED  COPY  command  will  be  aborted  with  additional  sense
       'UNEXPECTED INEXACT SEGMENT'.

       If  only  the <u>cat</u> bit is set the residual data will be retained and made available for subsequent segment
       descriptors. Residual data will be discarded for the last segment descriptor.

       If the <u>pad</u> bit is set for the source descriptor only, any residual data for both  source  or  destination
       will be discarded.

       If  the  <u>pad</u> bit is set for the target descriptor only any residual source data will be handled as if the
       <u>cat</u> bit is set, but any residual destination data will be padded to make a whole block transfer.

       If the <u>pad</u> bit is set for both source and target any residual source data  will  be  discarded,  and  any
       residual destination data will be padded.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  command  line invocation does not explicitly (and unambiguously) indicate whether the XCOPY SCSI
       command should be sent to <u>IFILE</u> (i.e.  the source) or <u>OFILE</u> (i.e. the destination) then a check  is  made
       for  the  presence  of the XCOPY_TO_SRC and XCOPY_TO_DST environment variables. If either one exists (but
       not both) then it indicates where the SCSI XCOPY command will be sent. By default the  XCOPY  command  is
       sent to <u>OFILE</u>.

</pre><h4><b>RETIRED</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Here are some retired options that are still present:

       append=0 | 1
              when  set,  equivalent  to 'oflag=append'. When clear the action is to overwrite the existing file
              (if it exists); this is the default.  See the 'append' flag.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Copying data behind an Operating System's back can cause problems. In the case  of  Linux,  users  should
       look at this link:
         https://linux-mm.org/Drop_Caches

       This command sequence may be useful:
         sync; echo 3 &gt; <a href="file:/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches">/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</a>

       Various numeric arguments (e.g. <u>SKIP</u>) may include multiplicative suffixes or be given in hexadecimal. See
       the "NUMERIC ARGUMENTS" section in the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

       The  <u>COUNT</u>,  <u>SKIP</u>  and  <u>SEEK</u>  arguments  can take 64 bit values (i.e. very big numbers). Other values are
       limited to what can fit in a signed 32 bit number.

       All informative, warning and error output is sent to stderr so that dd's output file can  be  stdout  and
       remain unpolluted. If no options are given, then the usage message is output and nothing else happens.

       If  a device supports xcopy operations then it should set the 3PC field (3PC stands for Third Party Copy)
       in its standard INQUIRY response.  This utility will attempt a xcopy operation irrespective of the  value
       in the 3PC field but if it is zero (cleared) one would expect the xcopy operation to fail.

       The status of the SCSI EXTENDED COPY command can be queried with <b>sg_copy_results(sg3_utils)</b>

       Currently  only  block-to-block  transfers  are  implemented;  <u>IFILE</u> and <u>OFILE</u> must refer to a SCSI block
       device.

       No account is taken of partitions so, for example, /dev/sbc2, /dev/sdc,  /dev/sg2,  and  /dev/bsg/3:0:0:1
       would all refer to the same thing: the whole logical unit (i.e. the whole disk) starting at LBA 0. So any
       partition  indication  (e.g.  /dev/sdc2)  is  ignored.  The  user  should  set <u>SKIP</u>,  <u>SEEK</u> and <u>COUNT</u> with
       information obtained from a command like 'fdisk -l -u /dev/sdc' to account for partitions.

       XCOPY (LID1) capability has been added to the ddpt utility which is in a package of the  same  name.  The
       ddpt  utility  will  run on other OSes (e.g. FreeBSD and Windows) while sg_xcopy only runs on Linux. Also
       ddpt permits the arguments to <u>ibs=</u> and <u>ibs=</u> to be different.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Copy 2M of data from the start of one device to another:

       # sg_xcopy if=/dev/sdo of=/dev/sdp count=2048 list_id=2 dc=1
       sg_xcopy: if=/dev/sdo skip=0 of=/dev/sdp seek=0 count=1024
       Start of loop, count=1024, bpt=65535, lba_in=0, lba_out=0
       sg_xcopy: 1024 blocks, 1 command

       Check the status of the EXTENDED COPY command:

       # sg_copy_results --status --list_id=2 /dev/sdp
       Receive copy results (copy status):
           Held data discarded: Yes
           Copy manager status: Operation completed without errors
           Segments processed: 1
           Transfer count units: 0
           Transfer count: 0

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       The signal handling has been borrowed from dd: SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGPIPE output the number of remaining
       blocks to be transferred and the records in + out counts; then they have their default  action.   SIGUSR1
       causes the same information to be output yet the copy continues.  All output caused by signals is sent to
       stderr.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_xcopy is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

       An  additional exit status of 90 is generated if the flock flag is given and some other process holds the
       advisory exclusive lock.
