       MAKEFLOPPIES - Creates the default floppy device nodes.

</pre><h4><b>Note</b></h4><pre>
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically  generated  from  fdutils's texinfo documentation.  However, this
       process is only approximative, and some items, such as cross-references, footnotes and indices  are  lost
       in  this  translation  process.   Indeed,  these  items have no appropriate representation in the manpage
       format.  Moreover, only the items specific  to  each  command  have  been  translated,  and  the  general
       information about fdutils has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the
       original texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the following commands:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>dvi;</b> <b>dvips</b> <b>fdutils.dvi</b>

       *      To generate a HTML copy,  run:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>html</b>

              A pre-made HTML can be found at: `<a href="http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils">http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils</a>'

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs' info mode), run:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>info</b>

       The  texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as HTML.  Indeed, in the info version certain examples
       are difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
          MAKEFLOPPIES [-tlvng] [<u>drives</u>]

       The MAKEFLOPPIES shell script creates the new floppy  block  device  node.   It  uses  the  floppycontrol
       program  to  translate the minor device numbers into meaningful names. It also uses these names to decide
       whether to create a given block device file or not, depending on the type  of  the  physical  drive  (for
       instance, for a 3 1/2 drive, the formats corresponding to a 5 1/4 drive are not created).

       If  you  have more than two floppy drives, you need to tell the kernel the CMOS types of those additional
       drives using the floppy=<u>drive</u>,<u>type</u>,cmos lilo option.

       If the <u>drives</u>  parameter is given, only the device nodes for the listed drives are made. By default,  all
       only the two first drives are tried.

       MAKEFLOPPIES does not work if you redefine your default formats.

       <b>Caution</b>: MAKEFLOPPIES removes already existing floppy device nodes.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       -t     Use the old naming convention for 3 1/2 devices (e.g. `fd0H720' instead of `fd0u720').

       -m     Base  the  name  for  the  created  devices  on  the  type of the media (e.g. `fd0h720' instead of
              `fd0u720').

       -l     Local. Creates device nodes in the local directory, not <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a>

       -v     Verbose

       -n     Dry run. (just report what would be done, do not do anything)

       -g     Group.  Allow read/write access to floppy devices only for group `floppy'

</pre><h4><b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       The MAKEFLOPPIES script does not work on redefined "default" formats, If you  redefine  default  formats,
       you need to create the needed device nodes manually.
