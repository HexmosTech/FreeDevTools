</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Copy data to and from any files. Specialized for "files" that are Linux SCSI generic  (sg)  devices,  raw
       devices  or  other  devices  that  support  the  SG_IO ioctl (which are only found in the lk 2.6 series).
       Similar syntax and semantics to <b><a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a>(1)</b> command.

       The first group in the synopsis above are "standard" Unix <b><a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a>(1)</b> operands.  The  second  group  are  extra
       options added by this utility.  Both groups are defined below.

       When  the  <u>--verify</u>  option is given, then the read side is the same but the on the write side, the WRITE
       SCSI command is replaced by the VERIFY SCSI command. If  any  VERIFY  commands  yields  a  sense  key  of
       MISCOMPARE then the verify operation will stop. The <u>--verify</u> option can only be used when <u>OFILE</u> is either
       a  sg device or a block device with oflag=sgio also given. When the <u>--verify</u> option is used, this utility
       works in a similar fashion to the Unix <a href="../man1/cmp.1.html">cmp</a>(1) command.

       This utility is only supported on Linux whereas most other utilities in the sg3_utils package  have  been
       ported to other operating systems. A utility called "ddpt" has similar syntax and functionality to sg_dd.
       ddpt  drops some Linux specific features while adding some other generic features. This allows ddpt to be
       ported to other operating systems.

       For support of NVMe storage devices see the section below titled: NVME SUPPORT .

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>blk_sgio</b>={0|1}
              when set to 0, block devices (e.g. /dev/sda) are treated like  normal  files  (i.e.   <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a>(2)</b>  and
              <b><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a>(2)</b>  are used for IO). When set to 1, block devices are assumed to accept the SG_IO ioctl and
              SCSI commands are issued for IO. This is only supported for 2.6 series kernels.  Note  that  ATAPI
              devices  (e.g.  cd/dvd  players)  use the SCSI command set but ATA disks do not (unless there is a
              protocol conversion as often occurs in the USB mass storage class). If the input or output  device
              is  a  block  device  partition  (e.g.  /dev/sda3)  then  setting this option causes the partition
              information to be ignored (since access is directly to the underlying device). Default is  0.  See
              the 'sgio' flag.

       <b>bpt</b>=<u>BPT</u>
              each  IO  transaction will be made using <u>BPT</u> blocks (or less if near the end of the copy). Default
              is 128 for logical block sizes less that 2048 bytes, otherwise the default is 32.  So  for  bs=512
              the  reads  and  writes  will  each  convey 64 KiB of data by default (less if near the end of the
              transfer or memory restrictions). When cd/dvd drives are  accessed,  the  logical  block  size  is
              typically  2048 bytes and bpt defaults to 32 which again implies 64 KiB transfers. The block layer
              when the blk_sgio=1 option is used has relatively low upper limits for transfer sizes (compared to
              sg device nodes, see <a href="file:/sys/block/">/sys/block/</a>&lt;dev_name&gt;/queue/max_sectors_kb ).

       <b>bs</b>=<u>BS</u>  where <u>BS</u> <b>must</b> be the logical block size of the physical device (if  either  the  input  or  output
              files are accessed via SCSI commands). Note that this differs from <b><a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a>(1)</b> which permits <u>BS</u> to be an
              integral  multiple.  Default  is  512  which is usually correct for disks but incorrect for cdroms
              (which normally have 2048 byte blocks). For this utility the maximum size of  each  individual  IO
              operation is <u>BS</u> * <u>BPT</u> bytes.

       <b>cdbsz</b>={6|10|12|16}
              size  of  SCSI  READ  and/or  WRITE  commands  issued  on  sg  device names (or block devices when
              'iflag=sgio' and/or 'oflag=sgio' is given).  Default  is  10  byte  SCSI  command  blocks  (unless
              calculations  indicate  that  a 4 byte block number may be exceeded or <u>BPT</u> is greater than 16 bits
              (65535), in which case it defaults to 16 byte SCSI commands).

       <b>cdl</b>=<u>CDL</u>
              allows setting of command duration limits. <u>CDL</u> is either a single value or two values separated by
              a comma. If one value is given, it applies to both <u>IFILE</u>  and  <u>OFILE</u>  (if  they  are  pass-through
              devices).  If  two values are given, the first applies to <u>IFILE</u> while the second applies to <u>OFILE</u>.
              The value may be from 0 to 7 where 0 is the default  and  means  there  are  no  command  duration
              limits.  Command  duration  limits  are  only  supported  by 16 byte READ and WRITE commands (plus
              <a href="../man32/READ.32.html">READ</a>(32), <a href="../man32/WRITE.32.html">WRITE</a>(32) and the WRITE SCATTERED command, bit they are used by this  utility).  If  the
              cdbsz operand is not given and would have a value less than 16, then if <u>CDL</u> is greater than 0, the
              cdbsz is increased to 16.
              Command  duration  limits  can  be accesses and changed in the Command duration limit A and B mode
              pages, plus the Command duration limit T2A and T2B mode pages. The sdparm utility may be  used  to
              access and change these mode pages.

       <b>coe</b>={0|1|2|3}
              set  to  1  or  more  for continue on error ('coe'). Only applies to errors on sg devices or block
              devices with the 'sgio' flag set. Thus errors on other files will stop sg_dd. Default is  0  which
              implies stop on any error. See the 'coe' flag for more information.

       <b>coe_limit</b>=<u>CL</u>
              where  <u>CL</u>  is  the maximum number of consecutive bad blocks stepped over (due to "coe&gt;0") on reads
              before the copy terminates. This only applies when <u>IFILE</u> is accessed  via  the  SG_IO  ioctl.  The
              default  is  0  which is interpreted as no limit. This option is meant to stop the copy soon after
              unrecorded media is detected while still offering "continue on error" capability.

       <b>conv</b>=<b>sparse</b>
              see the CONVERSIONS section below.

       <b>count</b>=<u>COUNT</u>
              copy <u>COUNT</u> blocks from <u>IFILE</u> to <u>OFILE</u>. Default is the minimum  (of  <u>IFILE</u>  and  <u>OFILE</u>)  number  of
              blocks  that  sg  devices  report from SCSI READ CAPACITY commands or that block devices (or their
              partitions) report. Normal files are not probed for their size.  If  <u>skip=SKIP</u>  or  <u>seek=SEEK</u>  are
              given  and the count is derived (i.e.  not explicitly given) then the derived count is scaled back
              so that the copy will not overrun the device. If the file name is a  block  device  partition  and
              <u>COUNT</u>  is  not  given  then  the size of the partition rather than the size of the whole device is
              used. If <u>COUNT</u> is not given (or <u>count=-1</u>) and cannot be derived then an error  message  is  issued
              and no copy takes place.

       <b>dio</b>={0|1}
              default  is  0  which  selects indirect (buffered) IO on sg devices. Value of 1 attempts direct IO
              which, if not available, falls back to indirect IO and notes this at completion. If direct  IO  is
              selected  and <a href="file:/sys/module/sg/parameters/allow_dio">/sys/module/sg/parameters/allow_dio</a> has the value of 0 then a warning is issued (and
              indirect IO is performed). For finer grain control use 'iflag=dio' or 'oflag=dio'.

       <b>ibs</b>=<u>BS</u> if given must be the same as <u>BS</u> given to 'bs=' option.

       <b>if</b>=<u>IFILE</u>
              read from <u>IFILE</u> instead of stdin. If <u>IFILE</u> is '-' then  stdin  is  read.  Starts  reading  at  the
              beginning of <u>IFILE</u> unless <u>SKIP</u> is given.

       <b>iflag</b>=<u>FLAGS</u>
              where  <u>FLAGS</u>  is  a  comma  separated  list  of one or more flags outlined below.  These flags are
              associated with <u>IFILE</u> and are ignored when <u>IFILE</u> is stdin.

       <b>obs</b>=<u>BS</u> if given must be the same as <u>BS</u> given to 'bs=' option.

       <b>odir</b>={0|1}
              when set to one opens block devices (e.g. /dev/sda) with the O_DIRECT flag.  User  memory  buffers
              are  aligned to the page size when set. The default is 0 (i.e. the O_DIRECT flag is not used). Has
              no effect on sg, normal or raw files. If blk_sgio is  also  set  then  both  are  honoured:  block
              devices are opened with the O_DIRECT flag and SCSI commands are issued via the SG_IO ioctl.

       <b>of</b>=<u>OFILE</u>
              write  to  <u>OFILE</u>  instead of stdout. If <u>OFILE</u> is '-' then writes to stdout.  If <u>OFILE</u> is /dev/null
              then no actual writes are performed.  If <u>OFILE</u> is '.' (period) then it is treated the same way  as
              /dev/null  (this  is  a  shorthand  notation).  If  <u>OFILE</u> exists then it is _not_ truncated; it is
              overwritten from the start of <u>OFILE</u> unless 'oflag=append' or <u>SEEK</u> is given.

       <b>of2</b>=<u>OFILE2</u>
              write output to <u>OFILE2</u>. The default action is not to do this  additional  write  (i.e.  when  this
              option  is not given). <u>OFILE2</u> is assumed to be a normal file or a fifo (i.e. a named pipe). <u>OFILE2</u>
              is opened for writing, created if necessary, and closed at the end of the transfer. If <u>OFILE2</u> is a
              fifo (named pipe) then some other command should be consuming that data  (e.g.  'md5sum  OFILE2'),
              otherwise this utility will block.

       <b>oflag</b>=<u>FLAGS</u>
              where  <u>FLAGS</u>  is  a  comma  separated  list  of one or more flags outlined below.  These flags are
              associated with <u>OFILE</u> and are ignored when <u>OFILE</u> is /dev/null, '.' (period), or stdout.

       <b>retries</b>=<u>RETR</u>
              sometimes retries at the host are useful, for example when there is a transport error.  When  <u>RETR</u>
              is greater than zero then SCSI READs and WRITEs are retried on error, <u>RETR</u> times. Default value is
              zero.

       <b>seek</b>=<u>SEEK</u>
              start  writing  <u>SEEK</u>  bs-sized  blocks from the start of <u>OFILE</u>.  Default is block 0 (i.e. start of
              file).

       <b>skip</b>=<u>SKIP</u>
              start reading <u>SKIP</u> bs-sized blocks from the start of <u>IFILE</u>.  Default is block  0  (i.e.  start  of
              file).

       <b>sync</b>={0|1}
              when 1, does SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command on <u>OFILE</u> at the end of the transfer. Only active when <u>OFILE</u>
              is a sg device file name or a block device and 'blk_sgio=1' is given.

       <b>time</b>={0|1}[,<u>TO</u>]
              when  1,  times  transfer  and  does throughput calculation, outputting the results (to stderr) at
              completion. When 0 (default) doesn't perform timing.
              If that value is followed by a comma, then <u>TO</u> is the command timeout in  seconds  for  SCSI  READ,
              WRITE or VERIFY commands issued by this utility.  The default is 60 seconds.

       <b>verbose</b>=<u>VERB</u>
              as  <u>VERB</u> increases so does the amount of debug output sent to stderr.  Default value is zero which
              yields the minimum amount of debug output.  A value of 1 reports extra  information  that  is  not
              repetitive.  A  value 2 reports cdbs and responses for SCSI commands that are not repetitive (i.e.
              other that READ and WRITE). Error processing is not considered repetitive. Values of 3 and 4 yield
              output for all SCSI commands (and Unix read() and write() calls) so there can be a lot of  output.
              This  only  occurs for scsi generic (sg) devices and block devices when the 'blk_sgio=1' option is
              set.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>
              does all the command line parsing and preparation but bypasses  the  actual  copy  or  read.  That
              preparation  may  include  opening  <u>IFILE</u>  or <u>OFILE</u> to determine their lengths. This option may be
              useful for testing the syntax of complex command line invocations in advance of executing them.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              outputs usage message and exits.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--progress</b>
              this option causes a progress report to be output every two minutes until the  copy  is  complete.
              After the copy is complete a line with "completed" is printed to distinguish the final report from
              the  prior progress reports.  When used twice the progress report is every minute, when used three
              times the progress report is every 30 seconds.
              If this option is given then the 'time=1' option is set implicitly.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              when used once, this is equivalent to <u>verbose=1</u>. When used twice (e.g. "-vv") this  is  equivalent
              to <u>verbose=2</u>, etc.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--verify</b>
              do  a  verify  operation  (like  Unix  command  <a href="../man1/cmp.1.html">cmp</a>(1))  rather  than  a copy. Cannot be used with
              "oflag=sparse". <u>of=OFILE</u> must be given and <u>OFILE</u> must be an sg  device  or  a  block  device  with
              "oflag=sgio"  also  given. Uses the SCSI VERIFY command with the BYTCHK field set to 1. The VERIFY
              command is used instead of WRITE when this option is given. There is no <a href="../man6/VERIFY.6.html">VERIFY</a>(6)  command.  Stops
              on the first miscompare unless <u>oflag=coe</u> is given.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              outputs version number information and exits.

</pre><h4><b>CONVERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       One  or  more  conversions  can be given to the "conv=" option. If more than one is given, they should be
       comma separated. sg_dd does not perform the traditional dd conversions (e.g. ASCII to  EBCDIC).  Recently
       added conversions overlap somewhat with the flags so some conversions are now supported by sg_dd.

       nocreat
              this  conversion  has the same effect as "oflag=nocreat", namely: <u>OFILE</u> must exist, it will not be
              created.

       noerror
              this conversion is very close to "iflag=coe" and is treated as such. See the "coe" flag. Note that
              an error on <u>OFILE</u> will stop the copy.

       notrunc
              this conversion is accepted for compatibility with dd and ignored since the default action of this
              utility is not to truncate <u>OFILE</u>.

       null   has no affect, just a placeholder.

       sparse FreeBSD supports "conv=sparse" so the same syntax is supported in  sg_dd.   See  "sparse"  in  the
              FLAGS sections for more information.

       sync   is  ignored  by  sg_dd. With dd it means supply zero fill (rather than skip) and is typically used
              like this "conv=noerror,sync" to have the same functionality as sg_dd's "iflag=coe".

</pre><h4><b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a list of flags and their meanings:

       00     this flag is only active with <u>iflag=</u> and when given replaces <u>if=IFILE</u>. If both are given an  error
              is  generated.  The  input will be a stream of zeros, similar to using "if=/dev/zero" alone (but a
              little quicker), apart from the following case.
              If 'iflag=00,ff' is given then the block address (lower 32  bits,  in  4  bytes,  big  endian)  is
              placed, multiple times, in each block. The block address takes into account the <u>skip=SKIP</u> setting.
              The <b>sgp_dd</b> utility has a <u>--chkaddr</u> option that complements this option.

       append causes  the  O_APPEND  flag  to be added to the open of <u>OFILE</u>. For regular files this will lead to
              data appended to the end of any existing data. Cannot be used together with the  <u>seek=SEEK</u>  option
              as  they  conflict.  The default action of this utility is to overwrite any existing data from the
              beginning of the file or, if <u>SEEK</u> is given, starting  at  block  <u>SEEK</u>.  Note  that  attempting  to
              'append'  to  a  device  file  (e.g.  a  disk) will usually be ignored or may cause an error to be
              reported.

       coe    continue on error. Only active for sg devices and block devices that have  the  'sgio'  flag  set.
              'iflag=coe  oflag=coe'  and  'coe=1' are equivalent. Use this flag twice (e.g. 'iflag=coe,coe') to
              have the same action as the 'coe=2'.  A medium, hardware or blank check error while  reading  will
              re-read  blocks prior to the bad block, then try to recover the bad block, supplying zeros if that
              fails, and finally re-read the blocks after the bad block. A medium, hardware or blank check error
              while writing is noted and ignored. A miscompare sense key during a VERIFY command (i.e.  <u>--verify</u>
              given)  is noted and ignored when 'oflag=coe'. The recovery of the bad block when reading uses the
              SCSI READ LONG command if 'coe' given twice or more (also with the command line  option  'coe=2').
              Further, the READ LONG will set its CORRCT bit if 'coe' given thrice. SCSI disks may automatically
              try  and  remap  faulty  sectors (see the AWRE and ARRE in the read write error recovery mode page
              (the sdparm utility can access and possibly change these attributes)). Errors occurring  on  other
              files  types  will  stop  sg_dd.  Error  messages  are  sent  to  stderr.  This flag is similar to
              'conv=noerror,sync' in the <b><a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a>(1)</b> utility. See note about READ LONG below.

       dio    request the sg device node associated with  this  flag  does  direct  IO.  If  direct  IO  is  not
              available,  falls  back to indirect IO and notes this at completion.  If direct IO is selected and
              <a href="file:/sys/module/sg/parameters/allow_dio">/sys/module/sg/parameters/allow_dio</a> has the value of 0 then a warning is issued (and  indirect  IO
              is performed).

       direct causes  the  O_DIRECT  flag to be added to the open of <u>IFILE</u> and/or <u>OFILE</u>. This flag requires some
              memory alignment on IO. Hence user memory buffers are aligned to the page size. Has no  effect  on
              sg,  normal  or raw files. If 'iflag=sgio' and/or 'oflag=sgio' is also set then both are honoured:
              block devices are opened with the O_DIRECT flag and SCSI commands are issued via the SG_IO ioctl.

       dpo    set the DPO bit (disable page out) in SCSI READ and WRITE commands. Not supported for 6  byte  cdb
              variants of READ and WRITE. Indicates that data is unlikely to be required to stay in device (e.g.
              disk)  cache.  May  speed media copy and/or cause a media copy to have less impact on other device
              users.

       dsync  causes the O_SYNC flag to be added to the open of <u>IFILE</u> and/or <u>OFILE</u>.  The  'd'  is  prepended  to
              lower  confusion  with  the  'sync=0|1' option which has another action (i.e. a synchronisation to
              media at the end of the transfer).

       excl   causes the O_EXCL flag to be added to the open of <u>IFILE</u> and/or <u>OFILE</u>.

       ff     this flag is only active with <u>iflag=</u> and when given replaces <u>if=IFILE</u>. If both are given an  error
              is generated. The input will be a stream of 0xff bytes (or all bits set), apart from the following
              case.
              If  'iflag=00,ff'  is  given  then  the  block  address (lower 32 bits, in 4 bytes, big endian) is
              placed, multiple times, in each block. The block address takes into account the <u>skip=SKIP</u> setting.

       flock  after opening the associated file (i.e. <u>IFILE</u> and/or <u>OFILE</u>) an attempt is made to get an  advisory
              exclusive  lock  with the flock() system call. The flock arguments are "FLOCK_EX | FLOCK_NB" which
              will cause the lock to be taken if available else a "temporarily unavailable" error is  generated.
              An exit status of 90 is produced in the latter case and no copy is done.

       fua    causes the FUA (force unit access) bit to be set in SCSI READ and/or WRITE commands. This only has
              an  effect  with sg devices or block devices that have the 'sgio' flag set. The 6 byte variants of
              the SCSI READ and WRITE commands do not support the FUA bit.

       nocache
              use posix_fadvise() to advise corresponding file there is no need to fill  the  file  buffer  with
              recently read or written blocks.

       nocreat
              this  flag  is  only  active in <u>oflag=FLAGS</u>. If present then <u>OFILE</u> will be opened if it exists. If
              <u>OFILE</u> doesn't exist then an error is generated. Without this flag a  regular  (empty)  file  named
              <u>OFILE</u>  will  be  created (and then filled). For production quality scripts where <u>OFILE</u> is a device
              node (e.g. '/dev/sdc') this flag is recommended.  It guards  against  the  remote  possibility  of
              'dev/sdc'  disappearing  temporarily  (e.g. a USB memory key removed) resulting in a large regular
              file called '/dev/sdc' being created.

       null   has no affect, just a placeholder.

       pt     has the same meaning as the sgio flag. Added for compatibility with the ddpt utility.

       random this flag is only active with <u>iflag=</u> and when given replaces <u>if=IFILE</u>. If both are given an  error
              is  generated.  The  input  will be a stream of pseudo random bytes. The Linux <a href="../man2/getrandom.2.html">getrandom</a>(2) system
              call is used to create a seed and there after <a href="../man3/mrand48.3.html">mrand48</a>(3) is  used  to  generate  a  pseudo  random
              sequence,  4 bytes at a time. The quality of the randomness can be viewed with the <a href="../man1/ent.1.html">ent</a>(1) utility.
              This is not a high quality random number generator, it  is  built  for  speed,  not  quality.  One
              application is checking the correctness of the copy and verify operations of this utility.

       sgio   causes  block  devices  to  be  accessed  via the SG_IO ioctl rather than standard UNIX read() and
              write() commands. When the SG_IO ioctl is used the SCSI READ and WRITE commands are used  directly
              to move data. sg devices always use the SG_IO ioctl. This flag offers finer grain control compared
              to the otherwise identical 'blk_sgio=1' option.

       sparse after each <u>BS</u> * <u>BPT</u> byte segment is read from the input, it is checked for being all zeros. If so,
              nothing  is  written to the output file unless this is the last segment of the transfer. This flag
              is only active with the oflag option. It cannot be used when the  output  is  not  seekable  (e.g.
              stdout).  It  is ignored if the output file is /dev/null .  Note that this utility does not remove
              the <u>OFILE</u> prior to starting to write to it. Hence it may be advantageous to  manually  remove  the
              <u>OFILE</u>  if  it  is large prior to using oflag=sparse. The last segment is always written so regular
              files will show the same length and so programs like md5sum and sha1sum  will  generate  the  same
              value  regardless  of whether oflag=sparse is given or not. This option may be used when the <u>OFILE</u>
              is a raw device but is probably only useful if the device is known to contain zeros (e.g.  a  SCSI
              disk after a FORMAT command).

</pre><h4><b>RETIRED</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Here are some retired options that are still present:

       append=0 | 1
              when  set,  equivalent  to 'oflag=append'. When clear the action is to overwrite the existing file
              (if it exists); this is the default.  See the 'append' flag.

       fua=0 | 1 | 2 | 3
              force unit access bit. When 3, fua is set on both <u>IFILE</u> and <u>OFILE</u>; when 2, fua is set  on  <u>IFILE</u>;,
              when 1, fua is set on <u>OFILE</u>; when 0 (default), fua is cleared on both. See the 'fua' flag.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Block  devices  (e.g.  /dev/sda  and  /dev/hda)  can  be  given  for  <u>IFILE</u>.  If neither '-iflag=direct',
       'iflag=sgio' nor 'blk_sgio=1' is given then normal block IO involving buffering and caching is performed.
       If only '-iflag=direct' is given then the buffering and caching is bypassed (this is applicable  to  both
       SCSI  devices  and  ATA disks).  If 'iflag=sgio' or 'blk_sgio=1' is given then the SG_IO ioctl is used on
       the given file causing SCSI commands to be sent to the device and that also bypasses most of the  actions
       performed  by  the block layer (this is only applicable to SCSI devices, not ATA disks). The same applies
       for block devices given for <u>OFILE</u>.

       Various numeric arguments (e.g. <u>SKIP</u>) may include multiplicative suffixes or be given in hexadecimal. See
       the "NUMERIC ARGUMENTS" section in the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

       The <u>COUNT</u>, <u>SKIP</u> and <u>SEEK</u> arguments can take 64 bit values (i.e.  very  big  numbers).  Other  values  are
       limited to what can fit in a signed 32 bit number.

       Data usually gets to the user space in a 2 stage process: first the SCSI adapter DMAs into kernel buffers
       and  then the sg driver copies this data into user memory (write operations reverse this sequence).  This
       is called "indirect IO" and there is a 'dio' option to select "direct IO" which will  DMA  directly  into
       user memory. Due to some issues "direct IO" is disabled in the sg driver and needs a configuration change
       to activate it. This is typically done with 'echo 1 &gt; <a href="file:/sys/module/sg/parameters/allow_dio">/sys/module/sg/parameters/allow_dio</a>'.

       All  informative,  warning  and error output is sent to stderr so that dd's output file can be stdout and
       remain unpolluted. If no options are given, then the usage message is output and nothing else happens.

       Even if READ LONG succeeds on a "bad" block when 'coe=2' (or 'coe=3') is given, the  recovered  data  may
       not be useful. There are no guarantees that the user data will appear "as is" in the first 512 bytes.

       A raw device must be bound to a block device prior to using sg_dd.  See <b><a href="../man8/raw.8.html">raw</a>(8)</b> for more information about
       binding  raw  devices.  To  be  safe,  the sg device mapping to SCSI block devices should be checked with
       sg_map before use.

       Disk partition information can often be found with  <b><a href="../man8/fdisk.8.html">fdisk</a>(8)</b>  [the  "-ul"  argument  is  useful  in  this
       respect].

       For sg devices (and block devices when blk_sgio=1 is given) this utility issues SCSI READ and WRITE (SBC)
       commands which are appropriate for disks and reading from CD/DVD/HD-DVD/BD drives. Those commands are not
       formatted  correctly  for  tape devices so sg_dd should not be used on tape devices. If the largest block
       address of the requested transfer exceeds a 32 bit block number (i.e 0xffff) then a warning is issued and
       the sg device is accessed via SCSI <a href="../man16/READ.16.html">READ</a>(16) and <a href="../man16/WRITE.16.html">WRITE</a>(16) commands.

       The attributes of a block device (partition) are ignored when  'blk_sgio=1'  is  used.  Hence  the  whole
       device is read (rather than just the second partition) by this invocation:

          sg_dd if=/dev/sdb2 blk_sgio=1 of=t bs=512

</pre><h4><b>NVME</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Some  support  for copying from and to NVMe devices in Linux have been added.  There are two varieties of
       NVME "char" devices, examples: /dev/nvme&lt;cid&gt; and  /dev/ng&lt;cid&gt;n&lt;nsid&gt;  where  &lt;cid&gt;  is  the  controller
       identifier  (starting  at 0) and &lt;nsid&gt; is the NVMe namespace identifier (starting at 1). The latter form
       is  called   "nvme-generic"   in   <a href="file:/proc/devices">/proc/devices</a>   .    The   NVMe   block   devices   have   the   form:
       /dev/nvme&lt;cid&gt;n&lt;nsid&gt;[p&lt;part_id&gt;]  where  the optional &lt;part_id&gt; is the partition identifier (starting at
       1).  In the case of NVMe block devices the default action of sg_dd is to access them using standard  Unix
       IO  (i.e. <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a>(2) or <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a>(2)). To access them using SCSI/NVMe commands, the flag "sgio" or "pt" needs to
       be given (e.g. iflag=pt if=/dev/nvme0n1 ).

       Just as with partitions on SCSI  disks,  it  is  dangerous  to  access  NVMe  partitions  (e.g.  iflag=pt
       if=/dev/nvme0n1p2)  using  a  pass-through interface.  The reason is that both SCSI and NVMe commands are
       oblivious to any partitioning arrangement which Linux (or any other OS) has set up  on  those  disks.  In
       other words, in the above example the "p2" at the end of if=/dev/nvme0n1p2 is <b>ignored</b> when a pass-through
       is being used.

       The  READ  and  WRITE commands in NVMe are in the "NVM" command set which requires a NVMe namespace to be
       specified. This means that the char device /dev/nvme0 is not useful for the utility, only  administrative
       commands  can  be sent to it. That leaves the /dev/ng&lt;cid&gt;n&lt;nsid&gt; as the only NVMe "char" device that can
       be used with this utility. Since it is not a block device, the standard Unix <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a>(2)  and  <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a>(2)  will
       not work with it; so the pass-through interface, issuing SCSI/NVME commands, is assumed by this utility.

       The term "SCSI/NVME command" refers to the fact that this utility issues SCSI commands and a lower level,
       within  libsgutils,  converts  them to the corresponding NVMe commands. This action is known as a SCSI to
       NVMe Translation Layer (SNTL) and the NVMe consortium wrote a white paper on it early in the  development
       of NVMe.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Looks quite similar in usage to dd:

          sg_dd if=/dev/sg0 of=t bs=512 count=1MB

       This  will copy 1 million 512 byte blocks from the device associated with /dev/sg0 (which should have 512
       byte blocks) to a file called t.  Assuming /dev/sda and /dev/sg0 are the same device then  the  above  is
       equivalent to:

          dd if=/dev/sda iflag=direct of=t bs=512 count=1000000

       although  dd's  speed  may  improve  if  bs  was  larger  and  count was suitably reduced. The use of the
       'iflag=direct' option bypasses the buffering and caching that is usually done on a block device.

       Using a raw device to do something similar on a ATA disk:

          raw /dev/raw/raw1 /dev/hda
          sg_dd if=/dev/raw/raw1 of=t bs=512 count=1MB

       To copy a SCSI disk partition to an ATA disk partition:

          raw /dev/raw/raw2 /dev/hda3
          sg_dd if=/dev/sg0 skip=10123456 of=/dev/raw/raw2 bs=512

       This assumes a valid partition is found on the SCSI disk at the given skip block address (past the  5  GB
       point  of  that  disk)  and  that  the  partition  goes to the end of the SCSI disk. An explicit count is
       probably a safer option. The partition is copied to /dev/hda3 which  is  an  offset  into  the  ATA  disk
       /dev/hda . The exact number of blocks read from /dev/sg0 are written to /dev/hda (i.e. no padding).

       To time a streaming read of the first 1 GB (2 ** 30 bytes) on a disk this utility could be used:

          sg_dd if=/dev/sg0 of=/dev/null bs=512 count=2m time=1

       On completion this will output a line like: "time to transfer data was 18.779506 secs, 57.18 MB/sec". The
       "MB/sec" in this case is 1,000,000 bytes per second.

       The 'of2=' option can be used to copy data and take a md5sum of it without needing to re-read the data:

         mkfifo fif
         md5sum fif &amp;
         sg_dd if=/dev/sg3 iflag=coe of=sg3.img oflag=sparse of2=fif bs=512

       This  will  image /dev/sg3 (e.g. an unmounted disk) and place the contents in the (sparse) file sg3.img .
       Without re-reading the data it will also perform a md5sum calculation on the image.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       The signal handling has been borrowed from dd: SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGPIPE output the number of remaining
       blocks to be transferred and the records in + out counts; then they have their default  action.   SIGUSR1
       causes the same information to be output yet the copy continues.  All output caused by signals is sent to
       stderr.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The  exit status of sg_dd is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page. Since this
       utility works at a higher level than individual commands,  and  there  are  'coe'  and  'retries'  flags,
       individual SCSI command failures do not necessary cause the process to exit.

       An  additional exit status of 90 is generated if the flock flag is given and some other process holds the
       advisory exclusive lock.
