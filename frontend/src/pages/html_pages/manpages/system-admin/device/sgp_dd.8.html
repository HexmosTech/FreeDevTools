</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Copy  data  to  and  from  any  files.  Specialised  for "files" that are Linux SCSI generic (sg) and raw
       devices. Similar syntax and semantics to <b><a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a>(1)</b> but does not perform any conversions. Uses  POSIX  threads
       (often called "pthreads") to increase the amount of parallelism. This improves speed in some cases.

       The  first  group  in  the  synopsis above are "standard" Unix <b><a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a>(1)</b> operands. The second group are extra
       options added by this utility.  Both groups are defined below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bpt</b>=<u>BPT</u>
              each IO transaction will be made using <u>BPT</u> blocks (or less if near the end of the  copy).  Default
              is  128 for block sizes less that 2048 bytes, otherwise the default is 32. So for bs=512 the reads
              and writes will each convey 64 KiB of data by default (less if near the end  of  the  transfer  or
              memory  restrictions). When cd/dvd drives are accessed, the block size is typically 2048 bytes and
              bpt defaults to 32 which again implies 64 KiB transfers.

       <b>bs</b>=<u>BS</u>  where <u>BS</u> <b>must</b> be the block size of the physical device. Note that this differs  from  <b><a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a>(1)</b>  which
              permits  'bs'  to be an integral multiple of the actual device block size. Default is 512 which is
              usually correct for disks but incorrect for cdroms (which normally have 2048 byte blocks).

       <b>cdbsz</b>=6 | 10 | 12 | 16
              size of SCSI READ and/or WRITE commands issued on sg  device  names.   Default  is  10  byte  SCSI
              command  blocks (unless calculations indicate that a 4 byte block number may be exceeded, in which
              case it defaults to 16 byte SCSI commands).

       <b>coe</b>=0 | 1
              set to 1 for continue on error. Only applies to errors on sg devices.  Thus errors on other  files
              will  stop  sgp_dd.  Default  is  0  which  implies stop on any error. See the 'coe' flag for more
              information.

       <b>count</b>=<u>COUNT</u>
              copy <u>COUNT</u> blocks from <u>IFILE</u> to <u>OFILE</u>. Default is the minimum  (of  <u>IFILE</u>  and  <u>OFILE</u>)  number  of
              blocks  that  sg  devices  report from SCSI READ CAPACITY commands or that block devices (or their
              partitions) report. Normal files are not probed for their size.  If  <u>skip=SKIP</u>  or  <u>seek=SEEK</u>  are
              given and the count is deduced (i.e.  not explicitly given) then that count is scaled back so that
              the  copy  will  not overrun the device. If the file name is a block device partition and <u>COUNT</u> is
              not given then the size of the partition rather than the size of the  whole  device  is  used.  If
              <u>COUNT</u> is not given and cannot be deduced then an error message is issued and no copy takes place.

       <b>deb</b>=<u>VERB</u>
              outputs  debug  information. If <u>VERB</u> is 0 (default) then there is minimal debug information and as
              <u>VERB</u> increases so does the amount of debug (max debug output when <u>VERB</u> is 9).

       <b>dio</b>=0 | 1
              default is 0 which selects indirect IO. Value of 1 attempts direct IO  which,  if  not  available,
              falls  back  to  indirect  IO  and  notes  this  at  completion.  If  direct  IO  is  selected and
              <a href="file:/sys/module/sg/parameters/allow_dio">/sys/module/sg/parameters/allow_dio</a> has the value of 0 then a warning is issued (and  indirect  IO
              is performed) For finer grain control use 'iflag=dio' or 'oflag=dio'.

       <b>ibs</b>=<u>BS</u> if given must be the same as <u>BS</u> given to 'bs=' option.

       <b>if</b>=<u>IFILE</u>
              read  from  <u>IFILE</u>  instead  of  stdin.  If  <u>IFILE</u> is '-' then stdin is read. Starts reading at the
              beginning of <u>IFILE</u> unless <u>SKIP</u> is given.

       <b>iflag</b>=<u>FLAGS</u>
              where <u>FLAGS</u> is a comma separated list of one or  more  flags  outlined  below.   These  flags  are
              associated with <u>IFILE</u> and are ignored when <u>IFILE</u> is stdin.

       <b>obs</b>=<u>BS</u> if given must be the same as <u>BS</u> given to 'bs=' option.

       <b>of</b>=<u>OFILE</u>
              write  to  <u>OFILE</u>  instead of stdout. If <u>OFILE</u> is '-' then writes to stdout.  If <u>OFILE</u> is /dev/null
              then no actual writes are performed.  If <u>OFILE</u> is '.' (period) then it is treated the same way  as
              /dev/null  (this  is  a  shorthand  notation).  If  <u>OFILE</u> exists then it is _not_ truncated; it is
              overwritten from the start of <u>OFILE</u> unless 'oflag=append' or <u>SEEK</u> is given.

       <b>oflag</b>=<u>FLAGS</u>
              where <u>FLAGS</u> is a comma separated list of one or  more  flags  outlined  below.   These  flags  are
              associated with <u>OFILE</u> and are ignored when <u>OFILE</u> is /dev/null, '.' (period), or stdout.

       <b>seek</b>=<u>SEEK</u>
              start  writing  <u>SEEK</u>  bs-sized  blocks from the start of <u>OFILE</u>.  Default is block 0 (i.e. start of
              file).

       <b>skip</b>=<u>SKIP</u>
              start reading <u>SKIP</u> bs-sized blocks from the start of <u>IFILE</u>.  Default is block  0  (i.e.  start  of
              file).

       <b>sync</b>=0 | 1
              when 1, does SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command on <u>OFILE</u> at the end of the transfer. Only active when <u>OFILE</u>
              is a sg device file name.

       <b>thr</b>=<u>THR</u>
              where <u>THR</u> is the number or worker threads (default 4) that attempt to copy in parallel. Minimum is
              1 and maximum is 1024.

       <b>time</b>=0 | 1
              when  1, the transfer is timed and throughput calculation is performed, outputting the results (to
              stderr) at completion. When 0 (default) no timing is performed.

       <b>verbose</b>=<u>VERB</u>
              increase verbosity. Same as <u>deb=VERB</u>. Added for compatibility with sg_dd and sgm_dd.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--chkaddr</b>
              this option checks that every block read contains the (32 bit) block address  of  that  block.  If
              that  check  fails,  the  copy  exits  with a miscompare error.  This check complements the 'sg_dd
              iflag=00,ff' generation of blocks that contain their own (32 bit, big endian) block address.  When
              <u>--chkaddr</u>  is  used  once, only the first block address in each block is checked. When used twice,
              each block address (that fits in a block) is checked.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>
              does all the command line parsing and preparation but bypasses  the  actual  copy  or  read.  That
              preparation  may  include  opening  <u>IFILE</u>  or <u>OFILE</u> to determine their lengths. This option may be
              useful for testing the syntax of complex command line invocations in advance of executing them.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              outputs usage message and exits.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--progress</b>
              this option causes a progress report to be output every two minutes until the  copy  is  complete.
              After the copy is complete a line with "completed" is printed to distinguish the final report from
              the  prior progress reports.  When used twice the progress report is every minute, when used three
              times the progress report is every 30 seconds.
              If this option is given then the 'time=1' option is set implicitly.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              when used once, this is equivalent to <u>verbose=1</u>. When used twice (e.g. "-vv") this  is  equivalent
              to <u>verbose=2</u>, etc.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              outputs version number information and exits.

</pre><h4><b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a list of flags and their meanings:

       append causes the O_APPEND flag to be added to the open of <u>OFILE</u>. For normal files this will lead to data
              appended  to  the  end of any existing data.  Cannot be used together with the <u>seek=SEEK</u> option as
              they conflict.  The default action of this utility is to overwrite  any  existing  data  from  the
              beginning  of  the  file  or,  if  <u>SEEK</u>  is given, starting at block <u>SEEK</u>. Note that attempting to
              'append' to a device file (e.g.  a disk) will usually be ignored or  may  cause  an  error  to  be
              reported.

       coe    continue  on  error.  When given with 'iflag=', an error that is detected in a single SCSI command
              (typically 'bpt' blocks) is noted (by an error message sent to stderr), then zeros are substituted
              into the buffer for the corresponding write operation and the copy continues. Note that the  <b>sg_dd</b>
              utility  is  more  sophisticated  in  such  error  situations  when  'iflag=coe'.  When given with
              'oflag=', any error reported by a SCSI WRITE command is reported to stderr and the copy  continues
              (as if nothing went wrong).

       dio    request  the  sg  device  node  associated  with  this  flag  does direct IO.  If direct IO is not
              available, falls back to indirect IO and notes this at completion. If direct IO  is  selected  and
              <a href="file:/sys/module/sg/parameters/allow_dio">/sys/module/sg/parameters/allow_dio</a>  has  the value of 0 then a warning is issued (and indirect IO
              is performed).

       direct causes the O_DIRECT flag to be added to the open of <u>IFILE</u> and/or <u>OFILE</u>. This  flag  requires  some
              memory  alignment  on IO. Hence user memory buffers are aligned to the page size. Has no effect on
              sg, normal or raw files.

       dpo    set the DPO bit (disable page out) in SCSI READ and WRITE commands. Not supported for 6  byte  cdb
              variants of READ and WRITE. Indicates that data is unlikely to be required to stay in device (e.g.
              disk)  cache.   May speed media copy and/or cause a media copy to have less impact on other device
              users.

       dsync  causes the O_SYNC flag to be added to the open of <u>IFILE</u> and/or <u>OFILE</u>.  The  'd'  is  prepended  to
              lower  confusion  with  the  'sync=0|1' option which has another action (i.e. a synchronisation to
              media at the end of the transfer).

       excl   causes the O_EXCL flag to be added to the open of <u>IFILE</u> and/or <u>OFILE</u>.

       fua    causes the FUA (force unit access) bit to be set in SCSI READ and/or WRITE commands. This only has
              effect with sg devices. The 6 byte variants of the SCSI READ and WRITE commands do not support the
              FUA bit.  Only active for sg device file names.

       mmap   can only be used in the <u>iflag=FLAGS</u> or the <u>oflag=FLAGS</u> argument list but not both.  The  nominated
              side  of  the  copy will use memory mapped IO based on the <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a>(2) system call. The sg driver will
              remap its DMA destination or source buffer into the user space when the  <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a>(2)  system  call  is
              used on a sg device.

       null   has no affect, just a placeholder.

</pre><h4><b>RETIRED</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Here are some retired options that are still present:

       coe=0 | 1
              continue  on  error is 0 (off) by default. When it is 1, it is equivalent to 'iflag=coe oflag=coe'
              described in the FLAGS section above.  Similar to 'conv=noerror,sync' in <b><a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a>(1)</b> utility. Default is
              0 which implies stop on error. More advanced coe=1 processing on reads is performed by  the  sg_dd
              utility.

       fua=0 | 1 | 2 | 3
              force  unit  access bit. When 3, fua is set on both <u>IFILE</u> and <u>OFILE</u>; when 2, fua is set on <u>IFILE</u>;,
              when 1, fua is set on <u>OFILE</u>; when 0 (default), fua is cleared on both. See the 'fua' flag.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       A raw device must be bound to a block device prior to using sgp_dd.   See  <b><a href="../man8/raw.8.html">raw</a>(8)</b>  for  more  information
       about binding raw devices. To be safe, the sg device mapping to SCSI block devices should be checked with
       'sg_map' before use.

       Raw  device  partition information can often be found with <b><a href="../man8/fdisk.8.html">fdisk</a>(8)</b> [the "-ul" argument is useful in this
       respect].

       Various numeric arguments (e.g. <u>SKIP</u>) may include multiplicative suffixes or be given in hexadecimal. See
       the "NUMERIC ARGUMENTS" section in the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.

       The <u>COUNT</u>, <u>SKIP</u> and <u>SEEK</u> arguments can take 64 bit values (i.e.  very  big  numbers).  Other  values  are
       limited to what can fit in a signed 32 bit number.

       Data usually gets to the user space in a 2 stage process: first the SCSI adapter DMAs into kernel buffers
       and  then the sg driver copies this data into user memory (write operations reverse this sequence).  This
       is called "indirect IO" and there is a 'dio' option to select "direct IO" which will  DMA  directly  into
       user memory. Due to some issues "direct IO" is disabled in the sg driver and needs a configuration change
       to activate it.

       All  informative,  warning  and error output is sent to stderr so that dd's output file can be stdout and
       remain unpolluted. If no options are given, then the usage message is output and nothing else happens.

       Why use sgp_dd? Because in some cases it is twice as fast as dd (mainly with sg devices, raw devices give
       some improvement).  Another reason is that big copies fill the block device caches which has  a  negative
       impact on other machine activity.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       The signal handling has been borrowed from dd: SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGPIPE output the number of remaining
       blocks  to  be transferred and the records in + out counts; then they have their default action.  SIGUSR1
       causes the same information to be output yet the copy continues.  All output caused by signals is sent to
       stderr.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Looks quite similar in usage to dd:

          sgp_dd if=/dev/sg0 of=t bs=512 count=1MB

       This will copy 1 million 512 byte blocks from the device associated with /dev/sg0 (which should have  512
       byte  blocks)  to  a file called t.  Assuming /dev/sda and /dev/sg0 are the same device then the above is
       equivalent to:

          dd if=/dev/sda of=t bs=512 count=1000000

       although dd's speed may improve if bs was larger and count was correspondingly scaled. Using a raw device
       to do something similar on a ATA disk:

          raw /dev/raw/raw1 /dev/hda
          sgp_dd if=/dev/raw/raw1 of=t bs=512 count=1MB

       To copy a SCSI disk partition to an ATA disk partition:

          raw /dev/raw/raw2 /dev/hda3
          sgp_dd if=/dev/sg0 skip=10123456 of=/dev/raw/raw2 bs=512

       This assumes a valid partition is found on the SCSI disk at the given skip block address (past the  5  GB
       point  of  that  disk)  and  that  the  partition  goes to the end of the SCSI disk. An explicit count is
       probably a safer option.

       To do a fast copy from one SCSI disk to another one with similar geometry (stepping over  errors  on  the
       source disk):

          sgp_dd if=/dev/sg0 of=/dev/sg1 bs=512 coe=1

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sgp_dd is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page. Since this
       utility  works  at  a  higher  level  than  individual commands, and there are 'coe' and 'retries' flags,
       individual SCSI command failures do not necessary cause the process to exit.
