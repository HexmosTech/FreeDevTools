</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       vdostats - Display configuration and statistics of VDO volumes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vdostats</b> [<u>options</u> <u>...</u>] [<u>device</u> <u>[device</u> <u>...]</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vdostats</b>  displays  configuration and statistics information for the given VDO devices. If no devices are
       given, it displays information about all VDO devices.

       The VDO devices must be running in order for configuration and statistics
              information to be reported.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Show help message and exit.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
              This option is only for backwards compatibility. It is now equivalent to <b>--verbose</b>.

       <b>--human-readable</b>
              Display block values in readable form (Base 2: 1 KB = 2^10 bytes = 1024 bytes).

       <b>--si</b>   Modifies the output of the <b>--human-readable</b> option to use SI units (Base 10: 1 KB = 10^3  bytes  =
              1000 bytes). If the <b>--human-readable</b> option is not supplied, this option has no effect.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Displays the utilization and block I/O (bios) statistics for the selected VDO devices.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Prints the vdostats version number and exits

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The default output format is a table with the following columns, similar to that of the Linux <b>df</b> utility:

       <b>Device</b> The path to the VDO volume

       <b>1K-blocks</b>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following example shows sample output if no options are provided:

       /dev/mapper/my_vdo 1932562432 427698104  1504864328  22%  21%

       With the <b>--human-readable</b> option, block counts are converted to conventional units (1 KB = 1024 bytes):

       Device             Size   Used    Available   Use%   Space Saving%
       /dev/mapper/my_vdo 1.8T   407.9G  1.4T        22%    21%

       With the <b>--si</b> option as well, the block counts are reported using SI units (1 KB = 1000 bytes):

       Device             Size   Used    Available   Use%    Space Saving%
       /dev/mapper/my_vdo 2.0T   438G    1.5T        22%     21%
