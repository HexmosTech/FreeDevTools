</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sg_reset - sends SCSI device, target, bus or host reset; or checks reset state

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sg_reset</b> [<u>--bus</u>] [<u>--device</u>] [<u>--help</u>] [<u>--host</u>] [<u>--no-esc</u>] [<u>--target</u>] [<u>--verbose</u>] [<u>--version</u>] <u>DEVICE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  sg_reset  utility  with  no  options  (just a <u>DEVICE</u>) reports on the reset state (e.g. if a reset is
       underway) of the <u>DEVICE</u>. When given a <u>--device</u>, <u>--target</u>, <u>--bus</u> or <u>--host</u> option it  requests  a  device,
       target, bus or host reset respectively.

       A device reset is applied to the Logical Unit (LU) corresponding to <u>DEVICE</u>. It is most likely implemented
       by a Low level Driver (LLD) in Linux as a LOGICAL UNIT RESET task management function.

       The  ability  to  reset a SCSI target was added in Linux kernel 2.6.27 . A LLD may send Low level Drivers
       (LLDs) the I_T NEXUS RESET task management function. Alternatively it may use a transport mechanism to do
       the same thing (e.g. a hard reset on the link containing a SAS target).

       In the Linux kernel 2.6 and 3 series this utility can be called on sd,  sr  (cd/dvd),  st  or  sg  device
       nodes; if the user has appropriate permissions.

       Users  of this utility can check whether a reset recovery is already underway before trying to send a new
       reset with this utility. Calling this utility with no options, just the <u>DEVICE</u>, will do such a check.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b>, <b>--bus</b>
              attempt a SCSI bus reset. A bus reset is a SCSI Parallel Interface  (SPI)  concept  not  found  in
              modern  transports.  A  recent LLD may implement it as a series of resets on targets that might be
              considered as siblings to the target on the <u>DEVICE</u> path.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--device</b>
              attempt a SCSI device reset. This would typically  involve  sending  a  LOGICAL  UNIT  RESET  task
              management function to <u>DEVICE</u>.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--help</b>
              print the usage message then exit.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--host</b>
              attempt  a  host  reset.  The  "host" in this context is often called a Host Bus Adapter (HBA) and
              contains one or more SCSI initiators.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--no-esc</b>
              without this option, if a device reset (<u>--device</u>) fails then it will escalate to a  target  reset.
              And  if  a  target reset (<u>--target</u>) fails then it will escalate to a bus reset. And if a bus reset
              (<u>--bus</u>) fails then it will escalate to a host reset. With this option only the requested reset  is
              attempted. An alternate option name of <u>--no-escalate</u> is also accepted.

       <b>--no-escalate</b>
              The same as <b>-N</b>, <b>--no-esc</b>.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--target</b>
              attempt  a SCSI target reset. A SCSI target contains one or more LUs. This would typically involve
              sending a I_T NEXUS RESET task management function to <u>DEVICE</u> There may be a transport action  that
              is equivalent (e.g.  in SAS a hard reset on the link that contains the target).

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase the degree of verbosity (debug messages).

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              prints the version string then exits.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  error  recovery  code within the Linux kernel (SCSI mid-level) when faced with a SCSI command timing
       out and no response from the device (LU) does the following. First it tries a device reset and if that is
       not successful tries a target reset. If that is not successful it tries a  bus  reset.  If  that  is  not
       successful  it  tries  a  host reset. The "device,target,bus,host" order is the reset escalation that the
       <u>--no-esc</u> option attempts  to  stop.  In  large  storage  configurations  the  escalation  may  be  (very)
       undesirable.

       This  utility  calls  the  SG_SCSI_RESET  ioctl and as of lk 3.10.7 the <u>--no-esc</u> option is not supported.
       Patches to implement this functionality may be accepted in lk 3.18 or 3.19 .

       SAM-4 and 5 define a hard reset, a LOGICAL UNIT RESET and a I_T NEXUS RESET. A hard reset is  defined  to
       be  a power on condition, a microcode change or a transport reset event. LOGICAL UNIT RESET and I_T NEXUS
       RESET can be requested via task management functions (and support for LOGICAL UNIT RESET  is  mandatory).
       In  Linux  the  SCSI  subsystem  leaves  it  up  to the LLDs as to exactly what type (if any) of reset is
       performed.  The "bus reset" is SCSI Parallel Interface (SPI) concept that may not map well to recent SCSI
       transports so it may be a dummy operation. A "host reset" attempts to  re-initialize  the  HBA  that  the
       request  passes  through  en  route  to  the <u>DEVICE</u>. Note that a "host reset" and a "bus reset" may cause
       collateral damage.

       This utility does not allow individual SCSI commands to be aborted. SAM-4 defines ABORT  TASK  and  ABORT
       TASK SET task management functions for that.

       Prior  to  SAM-3 there was a TARGET RESET task management function. And in SAM-4 I_T NEXUS RESET appeared
       which seems closely related: the "I_T" stands for Initiator-Target.

       Transports may have their own types of resets not supported by this utility.  For example SAS has a  link
       reset  in  which  both  ends  of  a  physical  link  (e.g.   between a SAS expander and a SAS tape drive)
       renegotiate their connection.

       Prior to version 0.57 of this utility the command line had short options only (e.g. <u>-d</u> but not <u>--device</u>).
       Also <u>-h</u> invoked a host reset while in the current version <u>-h</u> is equivalent to  <u>--help</u>  and  both  <u>-H</u>  and
       <u>--host</u> invoke a host reset. For backward compatibility define the environment variable SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS
       or  SG_RESET_OLD_OPTS . In this case <u>-h</u> will invoke a host reset and the output will be verbose as it was
       previously (equivalent to using the <u>--verbose</u> option now).  For example:

           SG_RESET_OLD_OPTS=1 sg_reset -h /dev/sg1
       sg_reset: starting host reset
       sg_reset: completed host reset

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Since sg3_utils version 1.23 the environment variables SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS  or  SG_RESET_OLD_OPTS  can  be
       given.  When either is present this utility will expect the older command line options as outlined in the
       NOTES section.
