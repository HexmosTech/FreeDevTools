       lspci - list all PCI devices

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lspci</b> [<b>options</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lspci</b>  is  a  utility  for  displaying information about PCI buses in the system and devices connected to
       them.

       By default, it shows a brief list of devices. Use the options described below to request  either  a  more
       verbose output or output intended for parsing by other programs.

       If you are going to report bugs in PCI device drivers or in <u>lspci</u> itself, please include output of "lspci
       -vvx" or even better "lspci -vvxxx" (however, see below for possible caveats).

       Some  parts  of  the  output,  especially  in the highly verbose modes, are probably intelligible only to
       experienced  PCI  hackers.  For  exact  definitions  of  the  fields,  please  consult  either  the   PCI
       specifications or the <b>header.h</b> and <b><a href="file:/usr/include/linux/pci.h">/usr/include/linux/pci.h</a></b> include files.

       Access  to  some parts of the PCI configuration space is restricted to root on many operating systems, so
       the features of <u>lspci</u> available to normal users are limited. However, <u>lspci</u> tries its best to display  as
       much as available and mark all other information with <u>&lt;access</u> <u>denied&gt;</u> text.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Basic</b> <b>display</b> <b>modes</b>
       <b>-m</b>     Dump PCI device data in a backward-compatible machine readable form.  See below for details.

       <b>-mm</b>    Dump  PCI  device  data  in  a  machine  readable form for easy parsing by scripts.  See below for
              details.

       <b>-t</b>     Show a tree-like diagram containing all buses, bridges, devices and connections between them.

   <b>Display</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-v</b>     Be verbose and display detailed information about all devices.

       <b>-vv</b>    Be very verbose and display more details. This level includes everything deemed useful.

       <b>-vvv</b>   Be even more verbose and display everything we  are  able  to  parse,  even  if  it  doesn't  look
              interesting at all (e.g., undefined memory regions).

       <b>-k</b>     Show  kernel  drivers handling each device and also kernel modules capable of handling it.  Turned
              on by default when <b>-v</b> is given in the normal mode of output.  (Currently works only on Linux  with
              kernel 2.6 or newer.)

       <b>-x</b>     Show  hexadecimal  dump of the standard part of the configuration space (the first 64 bytes or 128
              bytes for CardBus bridges).

       <b>-xxx</b>   Show hexadecimal dump of the whole PCI configuration space.  It  is  available  only  to  root  as
              several  PCI  devices  <b>crash</b>  when  you  try to read some parts of the config space (this behavior
              probably doesn't violate the PCI standard, but it's at least very stupid). However,  such  devices
              are rare, so you needn't worry much.

       <b>-xxxx</b>  Show  hexadecimal  dump of the extended (4096-byte) PCI configuration space available on PCI-X 2.0
              and PCI Express buses.

       <b>-b</b>     Bus-centric view. Show all IRQ numbers and addresses as seen by the cards on the PCI  bus  instead
              of as seen by the kernel.

       <b>-D</b>     Always  show  PCI  domain  numbers.  By default, lspci suppresses them on machines which have only
              domain 0.

       <b>-P</b>     Identify PCI devices by path through each bridge, instead of by bus number.

       <b>-PP</b>    Identify PCI devices by path through each bridge, showing the bus number as  well  as  the  device
              number.

   <b>Options</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>resolving</b> <b>ID's</b> <b>to</b> <b>names</b>
       <b>-n</b>     Show PCI vendor and device codes as numbers instead of looking them up in the PCI ID list.

       <b>-nn</b>    Show PCI vendor and device codes as both numbers and names.

       <b>-q</b>     Use  DNS  to query the central PCI ID database if a device is not found in the local <b>pci.ids</b> file.
              If the DNS query succeeds, the result is cached in <b>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pci-ids</b> and it is recognized in
              subsequent runs even if <b>-q</b> is not given any more. Please use this switch inside automated  scripts
              only with caution to avoid overloading the database servers.

       <b>-qq</b>    Same as <b>-q</b>, but the local cache is reset.

       <b>-Q</b>     Query the central database even for entries which are recognized locally.  Use this if you suspect
              that the displayed entry is wrong.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>devices</b>
       <b>-s</b> <b>[[[[&lt;domain&gt;]:]&lt;bus&gt;]:][&lt;device&gt;][.[&lt;func&gt;]]</b>
              Show only devices in the specified domain (in case your machine has several host bridges, they can
              either  share  a  common  bus  number  space  or each of them can address a PCI domain of its own;
              domains are numbered from 0 to ffff), bus (0 to ff), device (0 to 1f) and function (0 to 7).  Each
              component of the device address can be omitted or set  to  "*",  both  meaning  "any  value".  All
              numbers are hexadecimal.  E.g., "0:" means all devices on bus 0, "0" means all functions of device
              0 on any bus, "0.3" selects third function of device 0 on all buses and ".4" shows only the fourth
              function of each device.

       <b>-d</b> <b>[&lt;vendor&gt;]:[&lt;device&gt;][:&lt;class&gt;[:&lt;prog-if&gt;]]</b>
              Show  only  devices  with specified vendor, device, class ID, and programming interface.  The ID's
              are given in hexadecimal and may be omitted or given as "*", both meaning "any value".  The  class
              ID can contain "x" characters which stand for "any digit".

   <b>Other</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-i</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Use <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> as the PCI ID list instead of /usr/share/misc/pci.ids.

       <b>-p</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Use  <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>  as  the  map  of  PCI  ID's  handled  by  kernel  modules.  By  default,  lspci  uses
              <a href="file:/lib/modules/">/lib/modules/</a><u>kernel_version</u>/modules.pcimap.  Applies only to  Linux  systems  with  recent  enough
              module tools.

       <b>-M</b>     Invoke  bus mapping mode which performs a thorough scan of all PCI devices, including those behind
              misconfigured bridges, etc. This option gives meaningful  results  only  with  a  direct  hardware
              access mode, which usually requires root privileges.  By default, the bus mapper scans domain. You
              can use the <b>-s</b> option to select a different domain.

       <b>--version</b>
              Shows <u>lspci</u> version. This option should be used stand-alone.

   <b>PCI</b> <b>access</b> <b>options</b>
       The PCI utilities use the PCI library to talk to PCI devices (see <b><a href="../man7/pcilib.7.html">pcilib</a></b>(7) for details). You can use the
       following options to influence its behavior:

       <b>-A</b> <b>&lt;method&gt;</b>
              The  library  supports  a  variety of methods to access the PCI hardware.  By default, it uses the
              first access method available, but you can use this option to override this decision. See <b>-A</b>  <b>help</b>
              for a list of available methods and their descriptions.

       <b>-O</b> <b>&lt;param&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              The  behavior of the library is controlled by several named parameters.  This option allows one to
              set the value of any of the parameters. Use <b>-O</b> <b>help</b> for a  list  of  known  parameters  and  their
              default values.

       <b>-H1</b>    Use  direct  hardware  access  via  Intel  configuration mechanism 1.  (This is a shorthand for <b>-A</b>
              <b>intel-conf1</b>.)

       <b>-H2</b>    Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 2.   (This  is  a  shorthand  for  <b>-A</b>
              <b>intel-conf2</b>.)

       <b>-F</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Instead  of  accessing  real  hardware, read the list of devices and values of their configuration
              registers from the given file produced by an earlier run of lspci -x.  This  is  very  useful  for
              analysis  of  user-supplied bug reports, because you can display the hardware configuration in any
              way you want without disturbing the user with requests for more dumps.

       <b>-G</b>     Increase debug level of the library.

</pre><h4><b>MACHINE</b> <b>READABLE</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       If you intend to process the output of lspci automatically, please use one of the machine-readable output
       formats (<b>-m</b>, <b>-vm</b>, <b>-vmm</b>) described in this section.  All  other  formats  are  likely  to  change  between
       versions of lspci.

       All  numbers  are  always  printed  in hexadecimal. If you want to process numeric ID's instead of names,
       please add the <b>-n</b> switch.

   <b>Simple</b> <b>format</b> <b>(-m)</b>
       In the simple format, each device is described on  a  single  line,  which  is  formatted  as  parameters
       suitable  for  passing  to  a  shell script, i.e., values separated by whitespaces, quoted and escaped if
       necessary.  Some of the arguments are positional: slot, class, vendor name, device name, subsystem vendor
       name and subsystem name (the last two are empty if the device has no subsystem); the remaining  arguments
       are option-like:

       <b>-r</b><u>rev</u>  Revision number.

       <b>-p</b><u>progif</u>
              Programming interface.

       The  relative order of positional arguments and options is undefined.  New options can be added in future
       versions, but they will always have a single argument not separated from the option  by  any  spaces,  so
       they can be easily ignored if not recognized.

   <b>Verbose</b> <b>format</b> <b>(-vmm)</b>
       The  verbose  output  is  a sequence of records separated by blank lines.  Each record describes a single
       device by a sequence of lines, each line containing a single `<u>tag</u>: <u>value</u>' pair. The <u>tag</u> and the <u>value</u> are
       separated by a single tab character.  Neither the records nor the  lines  within  a  record  are  in  any
       particular order.  Tags are case-sensitive.

       The following tags are defined:

       <b>Slot</b>   The  name of the slot where the device resides ([<u>domain</u>:]<u>bus</u>:<u>device</u>.<u>function</u>).  This tag is always
              the first in a record.

       <b>Class</b>  Name of the class.

       <b>Vendor</b> Name of the vendor.

       <b>Device</b> Name of the device.

       <b>SVendor</b>
              Name of the subsystem vendor (optional).

       <b>SDevice</b>
              Name of the subsystem (optional).

       <b>PhySlot</b>
              The physical slot where the device resides (optional, Linux only).

       <b>Rev</b>    Revision number (optional).

       <b>ProgIf</b> Programming interface (optional).

       <b>Driver</b> Kernel driver currently handling the device (optional, Linux only).

       <b>Module</b> Kernel module reporting that it is capable of handling the device (optional, Linux only). Multiple
              lines with this tag can occur.

       <b>NUMANode</b>
              NUMA node this device is connected to (optional, Linux only).

       <b>IOMMUGroup</b>
              IOMMU group that this device is part of (optional, Linux only).

       New tags can be added in future versions, so you should silently ignore any tags you don't recognize.

   <b>Backward-compatible</b> <b>verbose</b> <b>format</b> <b>(-vm)</b>
       In this mode, lspci tries to be perfectly compatible with its old versions.  It's almost the same as  the
       regular  verbose  format,  but the <b>Device</b> tag is used for both the slot and the device name, so it occurs
       twice in a single record. Please avoid using this format in any new code.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="file:/usr/share/misc/pci.ids">/usr/share/misc/pci.ids</a></b>
              A list  of  all  known  PCI  ID's  (vendors,  devices,  classes  and  subclasses).  Maintained  at
              https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/, use the <b>update-pciids</b> utility to download the most recent version.

       <b>/usr/share/misc/pci.ids.gz</b>
              If lspci is compiled with support for compression, this file is tried before pci.ids.

       <b>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pci-ids</b>
              All ID's found in the DNS query mode are cached in this file.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Sometimes, lspci is not able to decode the configuration registers completely.  This usually happens when
       not enough documentation was available to the authors.  In such cases, it at least prints the <b>&lt;?&gt;</b> mark to
       signal  that  there  is  potentially  something  more to say. If you know the details, patches will be of
       course welcome.

       Access to the extended configuration space is currently supported only by the <b>linux_sysfs</b> back-end.
