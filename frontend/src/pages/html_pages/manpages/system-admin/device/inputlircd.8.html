       inputlircd — zeroconf LIRC daemon using input event devices

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>inputlircd</b>  [<b>-d</b>  <u>socket</u>]  [<b>-f</b>]  [<b>-c</b>]  [<b>-r</b>  <u>repeat-rate</u>]  [<b>-g</b>] [<b>-m</b> <u>keycode</u>] [<b>-n</b> <u>device</u> <u>name</u>] [<b>-u</b> <u>username</u>]
                  [<b>-t</b> <u>path</u>] [<b>-N</b> <u>rc</u> <u>name</u>] <u>device</u> [<u>device</u> <b>...</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>inputlircd</b> is a small LIRC daemon that reads  from  <u>/dev/input/event</u>X  devices  and  sends  the  received
       keycodes  to  connecting LIRC clients.  <b>inputlircd</b> needs no configuration, it uses the standardised names
       for the keycodes as used by the kernel.  Many USB remote controls that present HID devices,  as  well  as
       multimedia keyboards should work out of the box.

       <b>inputlircd</b>  expects  a  list  of input event devices as commandline parameters.  It will only read events
       from those devices.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> <u>socket</u>
             Location of the UNIX socket to which LIRC clients can connect.  The default is <u>/run/lirc/lircd</u>.

       <b>-f</b>    Run in the foreground.

       <b>-c</b>    Capture modifier keys.  This causes the CTRL, SHIFT, ALT and META keys to  be  treated  as  modifer
             keys  that,  when used in combination with another keys, change the LIRC event from that key rather
             than being sent as their own LIRC events.

       <b>-r</b> <u>repeat-rate</u>
             Set the repeat rate (in milliseconds) of the remote control.  The default is 0. Repeated keys  that
             arrive less than <u>repeat-rate</u> milliseconds apart will be flagged as as repeat LIRC events.

       <b>-g</b>    Grab  the  input  device(s).  This gives <b>inputlircd</b> exclusive access to the input devices and stops
             events from propagating any further.

       <b>-m</b> <u>keycode</u>
             Minimum keycode to send to LIRC clients.  Keycodes lower than this number are  filtered  out.   The
             default  is  88,  this  filters  out  the  alphanumeric  section  and  the keypad section of normal
             keyboards, but allows all extended keys.  The rationale is that clients should not be able to  grab
             normal keypresses, this could be a security risk.

       <b>-n</b> <u>device</u> <u>name</u>
             Name  of an input device to read events from.  This scans all available input event devices, and if
             the symbolic name of an event device matches <u>device</u> <u>name</u>, adds it to the list of  devices  to  read
             from.   The  <u>device</u>  <u>name</u>  can  contain wildcard patterns, see <u><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></u>(7).  To get a list of available
             devices and their names, cat <u><a href="file:/proc/bus/input/devices">/proc/bus/input/devices</a></u> or use <u><a href="../man8/lsinput.8.html">lsinput</a></u>(8).

       <b>-u</b> <u>username</u>
             Set user and group id to that of <u>username</u> after opening the devices and UNIX socket as  root.   The
             default is nobody.

       <b>-t</b> <u>path</u>
             Provides  the  path  to  a file containing a mapping between input event key names and the commands
             which should be reported via lirc. The files should contain lines of the form <u>KEY_FOO</u> <u>=</u> <u>bar</u>.   This
             is useful for backward compatibility.  The default is not to use a translation table.

       <b>-N</b> <u>rc</u> <u>name</u>
             Set  the  remote  control  name, that is, a value of the last field of LIRC broadcast messages.  If
             there is more than one input event device, the specified name will be used for all of them.  If  <u>rc</u>
             <u>name</u>  is  not  specified, the filesystem path of each input event device will be used as its remote
             control name.

       <u>device</u>
             One or more input event devices.  If you want to use <b>inputlircd</b> to process multimedia keys  on  the
             keyboard,  then <u>/dev/input/event0</u> is the most likely choice.  If you have other input devices, such
             as USB remote controllers that act like a HID device, then you probably need one of the other event
             devices present.  See <u><a href="file:/proc/bus/input/devices">/proc/bus/input/devices</a></u> for a list of available input  devices.   If  unsure,
             you can add all available input event devices.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/run/lirc/lircd</u>
               Default location of the UNIX socket to which LIRC clients can connect.

       <u>/dev/input/event</u>X
               The kernel input layer's event device files.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/bus/input/devices">/proc/bus/input/devices</a></u>
               List of all input devices.
