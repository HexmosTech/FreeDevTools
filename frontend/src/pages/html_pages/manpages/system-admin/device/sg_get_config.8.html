</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sg_get_config - send SCSI GET CONFIGURATION command (MMC-4 +)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sg_get_config</b>   [<u>--brief</u>]  [<u>--current</u>]  [<u>--help</u>]  [<u>--hex</u>]  [<u>--inner-hex</u>]  [<u>--list</u>]  [<u>--raw</u>]  [<u>--readonly</u>]
       [<u>--rt=RT</u>] [<u>--starting=FC</u>] [<u>--verbose</u>] [<u>--version</u>] <u>DEVICE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sends a SCSI GET CONFIGURATION command to <u>DEVICE</u> and decodes the  response.  The  response  includes  the
       features and profiles of the device.  Typically these devices are CD, DVD, HD-DVD and BD players that may
       (but not necessarily) have media in them. These devices may well be connected via ATAPI, USB or IEEE 1394
       transports.  In  such  cases  they  are  "SCSI"  devices only in the sense that they use the "Multi-Media
       command" set  (MMC).   MMC  is  a  specialized  SCSI  command  set  whose  definition  can  be  found  at
       https://www.t10.org .

       This  utility is based on the MMC-4 and later draft standards. See section 5 on "Features and Profile for
       Multi_Media devices" for more information on specific feature parameters and profiles. The manufacturer's
       product manual may also be useful.

       Since modern DVD and BD writers support many features and profiles, the decoded output from this  utility
       can  be  large.  There  are  various  ways to cut down the output. If the <u>--brief</u> option is used only the
       feature names are shown and the feature parameters are not decoded. Alternatively if only one feature  is
       of  interest then this combination of options is appropriate: "--rt=2 --starting=<u>FC</u>". Another possibility
       is to show only the features that are relevant to the media  in  the  drive  (i.e.  "current")  with  the
       "--rt=1" option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--brief</b>
              show  the  feature names but don't decode the parameters of those features.  When used with <u>--list</u>
              outputs known feature names but not known profile names.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--current</b>
              output features marked as current. This option is equivalent to '--rt=1'.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              output the usage message then exit.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b>
              output the response in hex (don't decode response).

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--inner-hex</b>
              decode to the feature name level then output each feature's data in hex.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
              list all known feature and profile names. Ignore the device name (if  given).   Simply  lists  the
              feature  names  and  profiles  (followed  by  their  hex values) that this utility knows about. If
              <u>--brief</u> is also given then only feature names are listed.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--readonly</b>
              opens the DEVICE read-only rather than read-write which is the default. The Linux sg driver  needs
              read-write  access  for  the  SCSI  GET CONFIGURATION command but other access methods may require
              read-only access.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--rt</b>=<u>RT</u>
              where <u>RT</u> is the field of that name in the GET CONFIGURATION cdb.  Allowable values are 0, 1, 2, or
              3 . The command's action also depends on the value given to the <u>--starting=FC</u> option. The  default
              value  is  0.  When <u>RT</u> is 0 then all features, regardless of currency, are returned (whose feature
              code is greater than or equal to <u>FC</u> given to <u>--starting=</u>). When <u>RT</u> is 1 then all current  features
              are  returned  (whose  feature code is greater than or equal to <u>FC</u>). When <u>RT</u> is 2 then the feature
              whose feature code is equal to <u>FC</u>, if any, is returned.  When <u>RT</u> is 3  the  response  is  reserved
              (probably yields an "illegal field in cdb" error). To simplify the meanings of the <u>RT</u> values are:
                  <b>0</b> : all features, current on not
                  <b>1</b> : only current features
                  <b>2</b> : only feature whose code is <u>FC</u>
                  <b>3</b> : reserved

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--raw</b>
              output  response in binary (to stdout). Note that the short form is <u>-R</u> unlike most other utilities
              in this package that use <u>-r</u> for this action.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--starting</b>=<u>FC</u>
              where <u>FC</u> is the feature code value. This option works closely with  the  <u>--rt=RT</u>  option.  The  <u>FC</u>
              value is in the range 0 to 65535 (0xffff) inclusive. Its default value is 0. A value prefixed with
              "0x" (or a trailing 'h') is interpreted as hexadecimal.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              print the version string and then exit.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       There  are multiple versions of the MMC (draft) standards: MMC [1997], MMC-2 [2000],  MMC-3 [2002], MMC-4
       and MMC-5. The first three are now ANSI INCITS standards with the year they  became  standards  shown  in
       brackets.  The  draft  immediately  prior to standardization can be found at https://www.t10.org . In the
       initial MMC standard there was no GET CONFIGURATION command and the  relevant  information  was  obtained
       from the "CD capabilities and mechanical status mode page" (mode page 0x2a). It was later renamed the "MM
       capabilities  and  mechanical  status  mode  page" and has been made obsolete in MMC-4 and MMC-5. The GET
       CONFIGURATION command was introduced in MMC-2 and has become  a  replacement  for  that  mode  page.  New
       features  such as support for "BD" (blue ray) media type can only be found by using the GET CONFIGURATION
       command. Hence older CD players may not support the GET CONFIGURATION  command  in  which  case  the  "MM
       capabilities ..."  mode page can be checked with <a href="../man8/sdparm.8.html">sdparm</a>(8), <a href="../man8/sginfo.8.html">sginfo</a>(8) or <a href="../man8/sg_modes.8.html">sg_modes</a>(8).

       In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the <u>DEVICE</u> must be a SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block
       devices  can  also be specified. For example "sg_get_config /dev/hdc" will work in the 2.6 series kernels
       as long as /dev/hdc is an ATAPI device. In the 2.6 series external DVD writers attached via USB could  be
       queried with "sg_get_config /dev/scd1" for example.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_get_config is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.
