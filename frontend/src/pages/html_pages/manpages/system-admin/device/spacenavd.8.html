</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       spacenavd, spnavd_ctl - daemon for 3D-input-devices

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>spacenavd</b>
       <b>spnavd_ctl</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>spacenavd</b> commands.

       The  <b>spacenav</b>  project  provides  a  free,  compatible alternative, to the proprietary 3Dconnexion device
       driver and SDK, for their 3D input devices (called “space navigator”, “space pilot”,  “space  traveller”,
       etc).

       <b>spacenavd,</b>  is  a free software replacement user-space driver (daemon), for 3Dconnexion's space-something
       6dof input devices. It's compatible with the original 3dxsrv proprietary daemon provided by  3Dconnexion,
       and works perfectly with any program that was written for the 3Dconnexion driver.

   <b>Starting</b>
       Depending  on  how  your system startup process is set up, it might be the case that the spacenavd daemon
       starts before the X server (for instance if you don't use a graphical login). In  that  case  the  daemon
       will start properly, but won't connect to the X server until explicitly told to do so. You can do that by
       running  <b>spnavd_ctl</b>  <b>x11</b> <b>start</b> as root, or by using the graphical <b>spnavcfg</b> program. You don't really want
       to have to do that all the time though, so it's a  better  idea  to  add  the  aforementioned  <b>spnavd_ctl</b>
       command to either your <a href="file:~/.xsession">~/.xsession</a> or <a href="file:~/.xinitrd">~/.xinitrd</a> file, or the system-wide /etc/X11/Xsession file.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       The  <b>spacenavd</b>  daemon  reads a number of options from the /etc/spnavrc file. If that file doesn't exist,
       then it uses default values for everything. You may use the graphical <b>spnavcfg</b> program  to  interactively
       set  any  of  these  options.   The  daemon  should  respond  immediately  to  your changes, and also the
       configuration file should be updated automatically.
