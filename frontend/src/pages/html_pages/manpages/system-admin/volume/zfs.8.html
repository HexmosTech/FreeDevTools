</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>zfs</b>  command configures <b>ZFS</b> datasets within a <b>ZFS</b> storage pool, as described in <b><a href="../man1M/zpool.1M.html">zpool</a></b>(1M). A dataset
       is identified by a unique path within the <b>ZFS</b> namespace. For example:

         pool/{filesystem,volume,snapshot}

       where the maximum length of a dataset name is <b>MAXNAMELEN</b> (256 bytes).

       A dataset can be one of the following:

       <u>file</u> <u>system</u>

           A <b>ZFS</b> dataset of type <b>filesystem</b> can be mounted within the standard system namespace and behaves like
           other file systems. While <b>ZFS</b> file systems are designed to be <b>POSIX</b>  compliant,  known  issues  exist
           that  prevent  compliance in some cases. Applications that depend on standards conformance might fail
           due to nonstandard behavior when checking file system free space.

       <u>volume</u>

           A logical volume exported as a raw or block device. This type of dataset should only  be  used  under
           special circumstances. File systems are typically used in most environments.

       <u>snapshot</u>

           A  read-only  version  of  a  file  system  or  volume  at  a given point in time. It is specified as
           <u>filesystem@name</u> or <u>volume@name</u>.

   <b>ZFS</b> <b>File</b> <b>System</b> <b>Hierarchy</b>
       A <b>ZFS</b> storage pool is a logical collection of devices that provide space for datasets. A storage pool  is
       also the root of the <b>ZFS</b> file system hierarchy.

       The root of the pool can be accessed as a file system, such as mounting and unmounting, taking snapshots,
       and  setting  properties.  The  physical  storage  characteristics, however, are managed by the <b><a href="../man1M/zpool.1M.html">zpool</a></b>(1M)
       command.

       See <b><a href="../man1M/zpool.1M.html">zpool</a></b>(1M) for more information on creating and administering pools.

   <b>Snapshots</b>
       A snapshot is a read-only copy of a file system or volume. Snapshots can be  created  extremely  quickly,
       and initially consume no additional space within the pool. As data within the active dataset changes, the
       snapshot consumes more data than would otherwise be shared with the active dataset.

       Snapshots  can  have  arbitrary  names.  Snapshots of volumes can be cloned or rolled back, but cannot be
       accessed independently.

       File system snapshots can be accessed under the <b>.zfs/snapshot</b> directory in the root of the  file  system.
       Snapshots  are  automatically mounted on demand and may be unmounted at regular intervals. The visibility
       of the <b>.zfs</b> directory can be controlled by the <b>snapdir</b> property.

   <b>Clones</b>
       A clone is a writable volume or file system whose initial contents are the same as  another  dataset.  As
       with snapshots, creating a clone is nearly instantaneous, and initially consumes no additional space.

       Clones  can only be created from a snapshot. When a snapshot is cloned, it creates an implicit dependency
       between the parent and child. Even though the clone is created somewhere else in the  dataset  hierarchy,
       the  original  snapshot  cannot  be destroyed as long as a clone exists. The <b>origin</b> property exposes this
       dependency, and the <b>destroy</b> command lists any such dependencies, if they exist.

       The clone parent-child dependency relationship can be reversed by  using  the  <b>promote</b>  subcommand.  This
       causes  the  "origin" file system to become a clone of the specified file system, which makes it possible
       to destroy the file system that the clone was created from.

   <b>Mount</b> <b>Points</b>
       Creating a <b>ZFS</b> file system is a simple operation, so the number of file systems per system is  likely  to
       be  numerous.  To  cope with this, <b>ZFS</b> automatically manages mounting and unmounting file systems without
       the need to edit the <b>/etc/vfstab</b> file. All automatically managed file systems are mounted by <b>ZFS</b> at  boot
       time.

       By  default,  file  systems are mounted under <b>/</b><u>path</u>, where <u>path</u> is the name of the file system in the <b>ZFS</b>
       namespace. Directories are created and destroyed as needed.

       A file system can also have a mount point set in the <b>mountpoint</b> property. This directory  is  created  as
       needed,  and  <b>ZFS</b>  automatically mounts the file system when the <b>zfs</b> <b>mount</b> <b>-a</b> command is invoked (without
       editing <b>/etc/vfstab</b>). The <b>mountpoint</b> property can be inherited, so if <b>pool/home</b>  has  a  mount  point  of
       <b>/export/stuff</b>, then <b>pool/home/user</b> automatically inherits a mount point of <b>/export/stuff/user</b>.

       A file system <b>mountpoint</b> property of <b>none</b> prevents the file system from being mounted.

       If needed, <b>ZFS</b> file systems can also be managed with traditional tools (<b>mount</b>, <b>umount</b>, <b>/etc/vfstab</b>). If a
       file  system's  mount  point  is  set  to <b>legacy</b>, <b>ZFS</b> makes no attempt to manage the file system, and the
       administrator is responsible for mounting and unmounting the file system.

   <b>Zones</b>
       A <b>ZFS</b> file system can be added to a non-global zone by using the <b>zonecfg</b> <b>add</b> <b>fs</b> subcommand.  A  <b>ZFS</b>  file
       system that is added to a non-global zone must have its <b>mountpoint</b> property set to <b>legacy</b>.

       The  physical properties of an added file system are controlled by the global administrator. However, the
       zone administrator can create, modify, or destroy files within the added file system,  depending  on  how
       the file system is mounted.

       A  dataset  can  also  be delegated to a non-global zone by using the <b>zonecfg</b> <b>add</b> <b>dataset</b> subcommand. You
       cannot delegate a dataset to one zone and the children of the same dataset  to  another  zone.  The  zone
       administrator can change properties of the dataset or any of its children. However, the <b>quota</b> property is
       controlled by the global administrator.

       A  <b>ZFS</b>  volume  can be added as a device to a non-global zone by using the <b>zonecfg</b> <b>add</b> <b>device</b> subcommand.
       However, its physical properties can be modified only by the global administrator.

       For more information about <b>zonecfg</b> syntax, see <b><a href="../man1M/zonecfg.1M.html">zonecfg</a></b>(1M).

       After a dataset is delegated to a non-global zone, the <b>zoned</b> property is automatically set. A zoned  file
       system  cannot  be  mounted  in the global zone, since the zone administrator might have to set the mount
       point to an unacceptable value.

       The global administrator can forcibly clear the <b>zoned</b> property, though this should be done  with  extreme
       care. The global administrator should verify that all the mount points are acceptable before clearing the
       property.

   <b>Deduplication</b>
       Deduplication  is  the process for removing redundant data at  the block-level, reducing the total amount
       of data stored. If a file system has the <b>dedup</b>  property  enabled,  duplicate  data  blocks  are  removed
       synchronously.   The  result  is  that  only unique data is stored and common components are shared among
       files.

   <b>Native</b> <b>Properties</b>
       Properties are divided into two types, native properties and user-defined (or "user") properties.  Native
       properties  either export internal statistics or control <b>ZFS</b> behavior. In addition, native properties are
       either editable or read-only. User properties have no effect on <b>ZFS</b> behavior, but you  can  use  them  to
       annotate  datasets  in  a  way  that  is  meaningful in your environment. For more information about user
       properties, see the "User Properties" section, below.

       Every dataset has a set of properties that export statistics about the dataset as well as control various
       behaviors. Properties are inherited from the parent unless overridden by the child. Some properties apply
       only to certain types of datasets (file systems, volumes, or snapshots).

       The values of numeric properties can be specified using human-readable suffixes (for example, <b>k</b>,  <b>KB</b>,  <b>M</b>,
       <b>Gb</b>, and so forth, up to <b>Z</b> for zettabyte). The following are all valid (and equal) specifications:

         1536M, 1.5g, 1.50GB

       The  values  of  non-numeric  properties are case sensitive and must be lowercase, except for <b>mountpoint</b>,
       <b>sharenfs</b>, and <b>sharesmb</b>.

       The following native properties consist of read-only statistics about the dataset. These  properties  can
       be neither set, nor inherited. Native properties apply to all dataset types unless otherwise noted.

       <b>available</b>

           The  amount  of  space available to the dataset and all its children, assuming that there is no other
           activity in the pool. Because space is shared within a pool,  availability  can  be  limited  by  any
           number  of  factors, including physical pool size, quotas, reservations, or other datasets within the
           pool.

           This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>avail</b>.

       <b>compressratio</b>

           The compression ratio achieved for this dataset, expressed as a multiplier. Compression can be turned
           on by running: <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> <b>compression=on</b> <u>dataset</u>. The default value is <b>off</b>.

       <b>creation</b>

           The time this dataset was created.

       <b>defer_destroy</b>

           This property is <b>on</b> if the snapshot has been marked for deferred destroy by using the <b>zfs</b> <b>destroy</b>  <b>-d</b>
           command. Otherwise, the property is <b>off</b>.

       <b>mounted</b>

           For file systems, indicates whether the file system is currently mounted. This property can be either
           <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>.

       <b>origin</b>

           For  cloned file systems or volumes, the snapshot from which the clone was created. The origin cannot
           be destroyed (even with the <b>-r</b> or <b>-f</b> options) so long as a clone exists.

       <b>referenced</b>

           The amount of data that is accessible by this dataset, which may or may  not  be  shared  with  other
           datasets in the pool. When a snapshot or clone is created, it initially references the same amount of
           space as the file system or snapshot it was created from, since its contents are identical.

           This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>refer</b>.

       <b>type</b>

           The type of dataset: <b>filesystem</b>, <b>volume</b>, or <b>snapshot</b>.

       <b>used</b>

           The  amount  of  space  consumed  by  this dataset and all its descendents. This is the value that is
           checked against this dataset's quota and reservation. The space used does not include this  dataset's
           reservation,  but  does  take into account the reservations of any descendent datasets. The amount of
           space that a dataset consumes from its parent, as well as the amount of space that are freed if  this
           dataset is recursively destroyed, is the greater of its space used and its reservation.

           When snapshots (see the "Snapshots" section) are created, their space is initially shared between the
           snapshot and the file system, and possibly with previous snapshots. As the file system changes, space
           that  was previously shared becomes unique to the snapshot, and counted in the snapshot's space used.
           Additionally, deleting snapshots can increase the amount of space  unique  to  (and  used  by)  other
           snapshots.

           The  amount  of  space  used,  available,  or  referenced does not take into account pending changes.
           Pending changes are generally accounted for within a few seconds. Committing a change to a disk using
           <b><a href="../man3c/fsync.3c.html">fsync</a></b>(3c) or <b>O_SYNC</b> does not necessarily guarantee  that  the  space  usage  information  is  updated
           immediately.

       <b>usedby*</b>

           The  <b>usedby*</b>  properties  decompose  the <b>used</b> properties into the various reasons that space is used.
           Specifically, <b>used</b> = <b>usedbychildren</b> + <b>usedbydataset</b> + <b>usedbyrefreservation</b> +, <b>usedbysnapshots</b>.  These
           properties are only available for datasets created on <b>zpool</b> "version 13" pools.

       <b>usedbychildren</b>

           The  amount  of  space  used  by  children of this dataset, which would be freed if all the dataset's
           children were destroyed.

       <b>usedbydataset</b>

           The amount of space used by this dataset itself, which would be freed if the dataset  were  destroyed
           (after first removing any <b>refreservation</b> and destroying any necessary snapshots or descendents).

       <b>usedbyrefreservation</b>

           The  amount  of  space  used  by  a  <b>refreservation</b>  set on this dataset, which would be freed if the
           <b>refreservation</b> was removed.

       <b>usedbysnapshots</b>

           The amount of space consumed by snapshots of this dataset. In particular, it is the amount  of  space
           that  would  be freed if all of this dataset's snapshots were destroyed. Note that this is not simply
           the sum of the snapshots' <b>used</b> properties because space can be shared by multiple snapshots.

       <b>userused@</b><u>user</u>

           The amount of space consumed by the specified user in this dataset. Space is charged to the owner  of
           each  file,  as displayed by <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b>. The amount of space charged is displayed by <b>du</b> and <b>ls</b> <b>-s</b>. See the
           <b>zfs</b> <b>userspace</b> subcommand for more information.

           Unprivileged users can access only their own space usage. The root user,  or  a  user  who  has  been
           granted the <b>userused</b> privilege with <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b>, can access everyone's usage.

           The  <b>userused@</b>... properties are not displayed by <b>zfs</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b>. The user's name must be appended after
           the <b>@</b> symbol, using one of the following forms:

               o      <u>POSIX</u> <u>name</u> (for example, <b>joe</b>)

               o      <u>POSIX</u> <u>numeric</u> <u>ID</u> (for example, <b>789</b>)

               o      <u>SID</u> <u>name</u> (for example, <b>joe.smith@mydomain</b>)

               o      <u>SID</u> <u>numeric</u> <u>ID</u> (for example, <b>S-1-123-456-789</b>)

       <b>userrefs</b>

           This property is set to the number of user holds on this snapshot. User holds are set  by  using  the
           <b>zfs</b> <b>hold</b> command.

       <b>groupused@</b><u>group</u>

           The amount of space consumed by the specified group in this dataset. Space is charged to the group of
           each file, as displayed by <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b>. See the <b>userused@</b><u>user</u> property for more information.

           Unprivileged  users  can  only access their own groups' space usage. The root user, or a user who has
           been granted the <b>groupused</b> privilege with <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b>, can access all groups' usage.

       <b>volblocksize</b>=<u>blocksize</u>

           For volumes, specifies the block size of the volume. The <b>blocksize</b> cannot be changed once the  volume
           has been written, so it should be set at volume creation time. The default <b>blocksize</b> for volumes is 8
           Kbytes. Any power of 2 from 512 bytes to 128 Kbytes is valid.

           This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>volblock</b>.

       The following native properties can be used to change the behavior of a <b>ZFS</b> dataset.

       <b>aclinherit</b>=<b>discard</b> | <b>noallow</b> | <b>restricted</b> | <b>passthrough</b> | <b>passthrough-x</b>

           Controls  how <b>ACL</b> entries are inherited when files and directories are created. A file system with an
           <b>aclinherit</b> property of <b>discard</b> does not inherit any <b>ACL</b> entries. A file  system  with  an  <b>aclinherit</b>
           property  value of <b>noallow</b> only inherits inheritable <b>ACL</b> entries that specify "deny" permissions. The
           property value <b>restricted</b> (the default) removes the <b>write_acl</b> and <b>write_owner</b>  permissions  when  the
           <b>ACL</b>  entry  is inherited. A file system with an <b>aclinherit</b> property value of <b>passthrough</b> inherits all
           inheritable <b>ACL</b> entries without any modifications made to the <b>ACL</b> entries when they are inherited.  A
           file  system  with an <b>aclinherit</b> property value of <b>passthrough-x</b> has the same meaning as <b>passthrough</b>,
           except that the <b>owner@</b>, <b>group@</b>, and <b>everyone@</b> <b>ACE</b>s inherit the execute permission only  if  the  file
           creation mode also requests the execute bit.

           When  the  property  value  is  set  to  <b>passthrough</b>, files are created with a mode determined by the
           inheritable <b>ACE</b>s. If no inheritable <b>ACE</b>s exist that  affect  the  mode,  then  the  mode  is  set  in
           accordance to the requested mode from the application.

       <b>aclmode</b>=<b>discard</b> | <b>groupmask</b> | <b>passthrough</b>

           Controls  how  an  <b>ACL</b> is modified during <b><a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</a></b>(2). A file system with an <b>aclmode</b> property of <b>discard</b>
           deletes all <b>ACL</b> entries that do not represent the mode of the file. An <b>aclmode</b> property of  <b>groupmask</b>
           (the  default)  reduces user or group permissions. The permissions are reduced, such that they are no
           greater than the group permission bits, unless it is a user entry that has the same <b>UID</b> as the  owner
           of  the  file or directory. In this case, the <b>ACL</b> permissions are reduced so that they are no greater
           than owner permission bits. A file system with an <b>aclmode</b> property of <b>passthrough</b> indicates  that  no
           changes are made to the <b>ACL</b> other than generating the necessary <b>ACL</b> entries to represent the new mode
           of the file or directory.

       <b>atime</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>

           Controls  whether  the access time for files is updated when they are read. Turning this property off
           avoids producing write traffic when reading files and can result in  significant  performance  gains,
           though it might confuse mailers and other similar utilities. The default value is <b>on</b>.

       <b>canmount</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b> | <b>noauto</b>

           If  this  property  is set to <b>off</b>, the file system cannot be mounted, and is ignored by <b>zfs</b> <b>mount</b> <b>-a</b>.
           Setting this property to <b>off</b> is similar to setting the <b>mountpoint</b> property to <b>none</b>, except  that  the
           dataset  still has a normal <b>mountpoint</b> property, which can be inherited. Setting this property to <b>off</b>
           allows datasets to be used solely as a mechanism  to  inherit  properties.  One  example  of  setting
           <b>canmount=off</b>  is to have two datasets with the same <b>mountpoint</b>, so that the children of both datasets
           appear in the same directory, but might have different inherited characteristics.

           When the <b>noauto</b> option is set, a dataset can only be mounted and unmounted explicitly. The dataset is
           not mounted automatically when the dataset is created or imported, nor is it mounted by the <b>zfs</b> <b>mount</b>
           <b>-a</b> command or unmounted by the <b>zfs</b> <b>unmount</b> <b>-a</b> command.

           This property is not inherited.

       <b>checksum</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b> | <b>fletcher2,</b>| <b>fletcher4</b> | <b>sha256</b>

           Controls the checksum used to verify data integrity. The default value  is  <b>on</b>,  which  automatically
           selects  an appropriate algorithm (currently, <b>fletcher4</b>, but this may change in future releases). The
           value <b>off</b> disables integrity checking  on  user  data.  Disabling  checksums  is  <b>NOT</b>  a  recommended
           practice.

           Changing this property affects only newly-written data.

       <b>compression</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b> | <b>lzjb</b> | <b>gzip</b> | <b>gzip-</b><u>N</u> | <b>zle</b>

           Controls the compression algorithm used for this dataset. The <b>lzjb</b> compression algorithm is optimized
           for  performance  while  providing  decent  data compression. Setting compression to <b>on</b> uses the <b>lzjb</b>
           compression algorithm. The <b>gzip</b> compression algorithm  uses  the  same  compression  as  the  <b><a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a></b>(1)
           command.  You  can  specify  the  <b>gzip</b>  level  by using the value <b>gzip-</b><u>N</u> where <u>N</u> is an integer from 1
           (fastest) to 9 (best compression ratio). Currently, <b>gzip</b> is equivalent to <b>gzip-6</b> (which is  also  the
           default for <b><a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a></b>(1)).

           This  property  can also be referred to by its shortened column name <b>compress</b>. Changing this property
           affects only newly-written data.

       <b>copies</b>=<b>1</b> | <b>2</b> | <b>3</b>

           Controls the number of copies of data stored for this dataset. These copies are in  addition  to  any
           redundancy provided by the pool, for example, mirroring or RAID-Z. The copies are stored on different
           disks,  if possible. The space used by multiple copies is charged to the associated file and dataset,
           changing the <b>used</b> property and counting against quotas and reservations.

           Changing this property only affects newly-written data. Therefore, set this property at  file  system
           creation time by using the <b>-o</b> <b>copies=</b><u>N</u> option.

       <b>dedup</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b> | <b>verify</b> | <b>sha256</b>[,<b>verify</b>]

           Controls  whether  deduplication  is  in  effect for a dataset. The default value is <b>off</b>. The default
           checksum used for deduplication is <b>sha256</b> (subject to change).  When  <b>dedup</b>  is  enabled,  the  <b>dedup</b>
           checksum  algorithm  overrides  the  <b>checksum</b>  property. Setting the value to <b>verify</b> is equivalent to
           specifying <b>sha256,verify</b>.

           If the property is set to <b>verify</b>, then, whenever two blocks have the same signature, ZFS  will  do  a
           byte-for-byte comparison with the existing block to ensure that the contents are identical.

       <b>devices</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>

           Controls whether device nodes can be opened on this file system. The default value is <b>on</b>.

       <b>exec</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>

           Controls whether processes can be executed from within this file system. The default value is <b>on</b>.

       <b>mlslabel</b>=<u>label</u> | <b>none</b>

           The  <b>mlslabel</b>  property is a sensitivity label that determines if a dataset  can be mounted in a zone
           on a system with Trusted Extensions enabled. If the labeled dataset matches  the  labeled  zone,  the
           dataset can be mounted  and accessed from the labeled zone.

           When  the  <b>mlslabel</b> property is not set, the default value is <b>none</b>. Setting the  <b>mlslabel</b> property to
           <b>none</b> is equivalent to removing the property.

           The <b>mlslabel</b> property can be  modified  only  when  Trusted  Extensions  is  enabled  and  only  with
           appropriate  privilege.  Rights  to  modify it cannot be delegated. When changing a label to a higher
           label or setting the initial dataset label, the <b>{PRIV_FILE_UPGRADE_SL}</b> privilege  is  required.  When
           changing  a  label  to a lower label or the default (<b>none</b>), the <b>{PRIV_FILE_DOWNGRADE_SL}</b> privilege is
           required. Changing the dataset to labels other than the default can be done only when the dataset  is
           not  mounted.  When  a  dataset  with  the  default  label  is mounted into a labeled-zone, the mount
           operation automatically sets the <b>mlslabel</b> property to the label of that zone.

           When Trusted Extensions is <b>not</b> enabled, only datasets with the default label (<b>none</b>) can be mounted.

       <b>mountpoint</b>=<u>path</u> | <b>none</b> | <b>legacy</b>

           Controls the mount point used for  this  file  system.  See  the  "Mount  Points"  section  for  more
           information on how this property is used.

           When  the  <b>mountpoint</b>  property  is  changed for a file system, the file system and any children that
           inherit the mount point are unmounted. If the new  value  is  <b>legacy</b>,  then  they  remain  unmounted.
           Otherwise, they are automatically remounted in the new location if the property was previously <b>legacy</b>
           or  <b>none</b>,  or  if  they  were  mounted  before the property was changed. In addition, any shared file
           systems are unshared and shared in the new location.

       <b>nbmand</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>

           Controls whether the file system should be mounted with <b>nbmand</b> (Non Blocking mandatory  locks).  This
           is  used for <b>CIFS</b> clients. Changes to this property only take effect when the file system is umounted
           and remounted. See <b><a href="../man1M/mount.1M.html">mount</a></b>(1M) for more information on <b>nbmand</b> mounts.

       <b>primarycache</b>=<b>all</b> | <b>none</b> | <b>metadata</b>

           Controls what is cached in the primary cache (ARC). If this property is set to <b>all</b>,  then  both  user
           data  and metadata is cached. If this property is set to <b>none</b>, then neither user data nor metadata is
           cached. If this property is set to <b>metadata</b>, then only metadata is cached. The default value is <b>all</b>.

       <b>quota</b>=<u>size</u> | <b>none</b>

           Limits the amount of space a dataset and its descendents can consume. This property enforces  a  hard
           limit  on  the  amount of space used. This includes all space consumed by descendents, including file
           systems and snapshots. Setting a quota on a descendent of a dataset that already has a quota does not
           override the ancestor's quota, but rather imposes an additional limit.

           Quotas cannot be set on volumes, as the <b>volsize</b> property acts as an implicit quota.

       <b>userquota@</b><u>user</u>=<u>size</u> | <b>none</b>

           Limits the amount of space consumed by the specified user. Similar  to  the  <b>refquota</b>  property,  the
           <b>userquota</b>  space  calculation  does  not  include  space that is used by descendent datasets, such as
           snapshots and clones. User space consumption is identified by the <b>userspace@</b><u>user</u> property.

           Enforcement of user quotas may be delayed by several seconds. This delay  means  that  a  user  might
           exceed  her  quota  before  the system notices that she is over quota. The system would then begin to
           refuse additional writes with the <b>EDQUOT</b> error message . See the <b>zfs</b> <b>userspace</b>  subcommand  for  more
           information.

           Unprivileged  users  can  only access their own groups' space usage. The root user, or a user who has
           been granted the <b>userquota</b> privilege with <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b>, can get and set everyone's quota.

           This property is not available on volumes, on file systems before  version  4,  or  on  pools  before
           version  15.  The  <b>userquota@</b>... properties are not displayed by <b>zfs</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b>. The user's name must be
           appended after the <b>@</b> symbol, using one of the following forms:

               o      <u>POSIX</u> <u>name</u> (for example, <b>joe</b>)

               o      <u>POSIX</u> <u>numeric</u> <u>ID</u> (for example, <b>789</b>)

               o      <u>SID</u> <u>name</u> (for example, <b>joe.smith@mydomain</b>)

               o      <u>SID</u> <u>numeric</u> <u>ID</u> (for example, <b>S-1-123-456-789</b>)

       <b>groupquota@</b><u>group</u>=<u>size</u> | <b>none</b>

           Limits the amount of space consumed by the specified group. Group space consumption is identified  by
           the <b>userquota@</b><u>user</u> property.

           Unprivileged  users  can  access only their own groups' space usage. The root user, or a user who has
           been granted the <b>groupquota</b> privilege with <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b>, can get and set all groups' quotas.

       <b>readonly</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>

           Controls whether this dataset can be modified. The default value is <b>off</b>.

           This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>rdonly</b>.

       <b>recordsize</b>=<u>size</u>

           Specifies a suggested block size for files in the file system. This property is designed  solely  for
           use  with  database  workloads that access files in fixed-size records. <b>ZFS</b> automatically tunes block
           sizes according to internal algorithms optimized for typical access patterns.

           For databases that create very large files but access them in small random chunks,  these  algorithms
           may  be  suboptimal. Specifying a <b>recordsize</b> greater than or equal to the record size of the database
           can result in significant performance gains. Use of this property for general purpose file systems is
           strongly discouraged, and may adversely affect performance.

           The size specified must be a power of two greater than or equal to 512 and less than or equal to  128
           Kbytes.

           Changing  the  file  system's  <b>recordsize</b>  affects  only  files created afterward; existing files are
           unaffected.

           This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>recsize</b>.

       <b>refquota</b>=<u>size</u> | <b>none</b>

           Limits the amount of space a dataset can consume. This property enforces a hard limit on  the  amount
           of space used. This hard limit does not include space used by descendents, including file systems and
           snapshots.

       <b>refreservation</b>=<u>size</u> | <b>none</b>

           The  minimum  amount of space guaranteed to a dataset, not including its descendents. When the amount
           of space used is below this value, the dataset is treated as if it were taking up the amount of space
           specified by <b>refreservation</b>. The <b>refreservation</b> reservation is accounted for in the parent  datasets'
           space used, and counts against the parent datasets' quotas and reservations.

           If  <b>refreservation</b>  is  set, a snapshot is only allowed if there is enough free pool space outside of
           this reservation to accommodate the current number of "referenced" bytes in the dataset.

           This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>refreserv</b>.

       <b>reservation</b>=<u>size</u> | <b>none</b>

           The minimum amount of space guaranteed to a dataset and its descendents. When  the  amount  of  space
           used  is  below  this  value,  the  dataset  is  treated  as if it were taking up the amount of space
           specified by its reservation. Reservations are accounted for in the parent datasets' space used,  and
           count against the parent datasets' quotas and reservations.

           This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, <b>reserv</b>.

       <b>secondarycache</b>=<b>all</b> | <b>none</b> | <b>metadata</b>

           Controls  what  is  cached  in the secondary cache (L2ARC). If this property is set to <b>all</b>, then both
           user data and metadata is cached. If this property is  set  to  <b>none</b>,  then  neither  user  data  nor
           metadata  is  cached.  If this property is set to <b>metadata</b>, then only metadata is cached. The default
           value is <b>all</b>.

       <b>setuid</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>

           Controls whether the set-<b>UID</b> bit is respected for the file system. The default value is <b>on</b>.

       <b>shareiscsi</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>

           Like the <b>sharenfs</b> property, <b>shareiscsi</b> indicates whether a <b>ZFS</b> volume is exported as an <b>iSCSI</b> target.
           The acceptable values for this property are <b>on</b>, <b>off</b>, and <b>type=disk</b>. The default value is <b>off</b>. In  the
           future, other target types might be supported. For example, <b>tape</b>.

           You  might want to set <b>shareiscsi=on</b> for a file system so that all <b>ZFS</b> volumes within the file system
           are shared by default. However, setting this property on a file system has no direct effect.

       <b>sharesmb</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b> | <u>opts</u>

           Controls whether the file system is shared by using the Solaris <b>CIFS</b> service, and what options are to
           be used. A file system with the <b>sharesmb</b> property set to <b>off</b> is  managed  through  traditional  tools
           such  as  <b><a href="../man1M/sharemgr.1M.html">sharemgr</a></b>(1M).  Otherwise, the file system is automatically shared and unshared with the <b>zfs</b>
           <b>share</b> and <b>zfs</b> <b>unshare</b> commands. If the property is set to <b>on</b>, the  <b><a href="../man1M/sharemgr.1M.html">sharemgr</a></b>(1M)  command  is  invoked
           with  no  options.  Otherwise,  the  <b><a href="../man1M/sharemgr.1M.html">sharemgr</a></b>(1M)  command  is invoked with options equivalent to the
           contents of this property.

           Because <b>SMB</b> shares requires a resource name, a unique resource name is constructed from  the  dataset
           name.  The  constructed  name is a copy of the dataset name except that the characters in the dataset
           name, which would be illegal in the resource name, are replaced with  underscore  (<b>_</b>)  characters.  A
           pseudo  property  "name"  is  also  supported  that  allows  you  to replace the data set name with a
           specified name. The specified name is then used  to  replace  the  prefix  dataset  in  the  case  of
           inheritance.  For example, if the dataset <b>data/home/john</b> is set to <b>name=john</b>, then <b>data/home/john</b> has
           a resource name of <b>john</b>. If a child dataset of <b>data/home/john/backups</b>, it  has  a  resource  name  of
           <b>john_backups</b>.

           When SMB shares are created, the SMB share name appears as an entry in the <b>.zfs/shares</b> directory. You
           can use the <b>ls</b> or <b>chmod</b> command to display the share-level ACLs on the entries in this directory.

           When  the  <b>sharesmb</b>  property  is  changed for a dataset, the dataset and any children inheriting the
           property are re-shared with the new options, only if the property was previously set to  <b>off</b>,  or  if
           they were shared before the property was changed. If the new property is set to <b>off</b>, the file systems
           are unshared.

       <b>sharenfs</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b> | <u>opts</u>

           Controls  whether  the file system is shared via <b>NFS</b>, and what options are used. A file system with a
           <b>sharenfs</b> property of <b>off</b> is managed through traditional tools such  as  <b><a href="../man1M/share.1M.html">share</a></b>(1M),  <b><a href="../man1M/unshare.1M.html">unshare</a></b>(1M),  and
           <b><a href="../man4/dfstab.4.html">dfstab</a></b>(4). Otherwise, the file system is automatically shared and unshared with the <b>zfs</b> <b>share</b> and <b>zfs</b>
           <b>unshare</b>  commands.  If  the  property is set to <b>on</b>, the <b><a href="../man1M/share.1M.html">share</a></b>(1M) command is invoked with no options.
           Otherwise, the <b><a href="../man1M/share.1M.html">share</a></b>(1M) command is invoked with options equivalent to the contents of this property.

           When the <b>sharenfs</b> property is changed for a dataset, the dataset  and  any  children  inheriting  the
           property are re-shared with the new options, only if the property was previously <b>off</b>, or if they were
           shared before the property was changed. If the new property is <b>off</b>, the file systems are unshared.

       <b>logbias</b> = <b>latency</b> | <b>throughput</b>

           Provides  a  hint to ZFS about handling of synchronous requests in this dataset. If <b>logbias</b> is set to
           <b>latency</b> (the default), ZFS uses the pool's log devices (if configured) to handle the requests at  low
           latency.  If <b>logbias</b> is set to <b>throughput</b>, ZFS does not use the configured pool log devices. Instead,
           ZFS optimizes synchronous operations for global pool throughput and efficient use of resources.

       <b>snapdir</b>=<b>hidden</b> | <b>visible</b>

           Controls whether the <b>.zfs</b> directory is hidden or visible in the root of the file system as  discussed
           in the "Snapshots" section. The default value is <b>hidden</b>.

       <b>version</b>=<b>1</b> | <b>2</b> | <b>current</b>

           The  on-disk version of this file system, which is independent of the pool version. This property can
           only be set to later supported versions. See the <b>zfs</b> <b>upgrade</b> command.

       <b>volsize</b>=<u>size</u>

           For volumes, specifies the logical size of the volume. By default, creating a  volume  establishes  a
           reservation  of  equal size. For storage pools with a version number of 9 or higher, a <b>refreservation</b>
           is set instead. Any changes to <b>volsize</b> are reflected in an equivalent change to the  reservation  (or
           <b>refreservation</b>). The <b>volsize</b> can only be set to a multiple of <b>volblocksize</b>, and cannot be zero.

           The  reservation  is  kept  equal  to  the  volume's  logical size to prevent unexpected behavior for
           consumers. Without the reservation, the volume  could  run  out  of  space,  resulting  in  undefined
           behavior  or  data corruption, depending on how the volume is used. These effects can also occur when
           the volume size is changed while it is in use (particularly when shrinking the  size).  Extreme  care
           should be used when adjusting the volume size.

           Though  not  recommended,  a  "sparse  volume"  (also known as "thin provisioning") can be created by
           specifying the <b>-s</b> option to the <b>zfs</b> <b>create</b> <b>-V</b> command, or  by  changing  the  reservation  after  the
           volume  has been created. A "sparse volume" is a volume where the reservation is less then the volume
           size. Consequently, writes to a sparse volume can fail with <b>ENOSPC</b> when the pool is low on space. For
           a sparse volume, changes to <b>volsize</b> are not reflected in the reservation.

       <b>vscan</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>

           Controls whether regular files should be scanned for viruses when a file is  opened  and  closed.  In
           addition to enabling this property, the virus scan service must also be enabled for virus scanning to
           occur. The default value is <b>off</b>.

       <b>xattr</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>

           Controls whether extended attributes are enabled for this file system. The default value is <b>on</b>.

       <b>zoned</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>

           Controls  whether  the  dataset  is  managed from a non-global zone. See the "Zones" section for more
           information. The default value is <b>off</b>.

       The following three properties cannot be changed after the file system is created, and therefore,  should
       be set when the file system is created. If the properties are not set with the <b>zfs</b> <b>create</b> or <b>zpool</b> <b>create</b>
       commands,  these  properties  are  inherited  from  the parent dataset. If the parent dataset lacks these
       properties due to having been created prior to these features being supported, the new file  system  will
       have the default values for these properties.

       <b>casesensitivity</b>=<b>sensitive</b> | <b>insensitive</b> | <b>mixed</b>

           Indicates  whether the file name matching algorithm used by the file system should be case-sensitive,
           case-insensitive, or allow a combination of both styles  of  matching.  The  default  value  for  the
           <b>casesensitivity</b> property is <b>sensitive</b>. Traditionally, UNIX and POSIX file systems have case-sensitive
           file names.

           The  <b>mixed</b> value for the <b>casesensitivity</b> property indicates that the file system can support requests
           for both case-sensitive and case-insensitive matching behavior. Currently, case-insensitive  matching
           behavior on a file system that supports mixed behavior is limited to the Solaris CIFS server product.
           For more information about the <b>mixed</b> value behavior, see the <u>Solaris</u> <u>ZFS</u> <u>Administration</u> <u>Guide</u>.

       <b>normalization</b> = <b>none</b> | <b>formC</b> | <b>formD</b> | <b>formKC</b> | <b>formKD</b>

           Indicates  whether  the file system should perform a <b>unicode</b> normalization of file names whenever two
           file names are compared, and which normalization algorithm should be  used.  File  names  are  always
           stored unmodified, names are normalized as part of any comparison process. If this property is set to
           a  legal value other than <b>none</b>, and the <b>utf8only</b> property was left unspecified, the <b>utf8only</b> property
           is automatically set to <b>on</b>. The default value of the <b>normalization</b> property is  <b>none</b>.  This  property
           cannot be changed after the file system is created.

       <b>utf8only</b>=<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>

           Indicates  whether  the  file  system  should  reject file names that include characters that are not
           present in the <b>UTF-8</b> character code set. If this property is explicitly set to <b>off</b>, the normalization
           property must either not be explicitly set or be set to <b>none</b>. The  default  value  for  the  <b>utf8only</b>
           property is <b>off</b>. This property cannot be changed after the file system is created.

       The <b>casesensitivity</b>, <b>normalization</b>, and <b>utf8only</b> properties are also new permissions that can be assigned
       to non-privileged users by using the <b>ZFS</b> delegated administration feature.

   <b>Temporary</b> <b>Mount</b> <b>Point</b> <b>Properties</b>
       When  a  file  system is mounted, either through <b><a href="../man1M/mount.1M.html">mount</a></b>(1M) for legacy mounts or the <b>zfs</b> <b>mount</b> command for
       normal file systems, its mount options are set according  to  its  properties.  The  correlation  between
       properties and mount options is as follows:

             PROPERTY                MOUNT OPTION
              devices                 devices/nodevices
              exec                    exec/noexec
              readonly                ro/rw
              setuid                  setuid/nosetuid
              xattr                   xattr/noxattr

       In  addition,  these  options  can be set on a per-mount basis using the <b>-o</b> option, without affecting the
       property that is stored on disk. The values specified on the command line override the values  stored  in
       the  dataset.  The  <b>-nosuid</b>  option  is an alias for <b>nodevices,nosetuid</b>. These properties are reported as
       "temporary" by the <b>zfs</b> <b>get</b> command. If the properties are changed while the dataset is mounted,  the  new
       setting overrides any temporary settings.

   <b>User</b> <b>Properties</b>
       In  addition  to  the standard native properties, <b>ZFS</b> supports arbitrary user properties. User properties
       have no effect on <b>ZFS</b> behavior, but applications or administrators can  use  them  to  annotate  datasets
       (file systems, volumes, and snapshots).

       User  property  names must contain a colon (<b>:</b>) character to distinguish them from native properties. They
       may contain lowercase letters, numbers, and the following punctuation characters: colon  (<b>:</b>),  dash  (<b>-</b>),
       period  (<b>.</b>),  and  underscore  (<b>_</b>). The expected convention is that the property name is divided into two
       portions such as <u>module</u><b>:</b><u>property</u>, but this namespace is not enforced by <b>ZFS</b>. User property names  can  be
       at most 256 characters, and cannot begin with a dash (<b>-</b>).

       When  making  programmatic  use of user properties, it is strongly suggested to use a reversed <b>DNS</b> domain
       name for the <u>module</u> component of property names to reduce the  chance  that  two  independently-developed
       packages  use  the  same property name for different purposes. Property names beginning with <b>com.sun</b>. are
       reserved for use by Sun Microsystems.

       The values of user properties are arbitrary strings, are always inherited, and are never  validated.  All
       of  the  commands  that  operate  on properties (<b>zfs</b> <b>list</b>, <b>zfs</b> <b>get</b>, <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b>, and so forth) can be used to
       manipulate both native properties and user properties. Use the  <b>zfs</b>  <b>inherit</b>  command  to  clear  a  user
       property  . If the property is not defined in any parent dataset, it is removed entirely. Property values
       are limited to 1024 characters.

   <b>ZFS</b> <b>Volumes</b> <b>as</b> <b>Swap</b> <b>or</b> <b>Dump</b> <b>Devices</b>
       During an initial installation or a live upgrade from a <b>UFS</b> file system, a swap device  and  dump  device
       are  created on <b>ZFS</b> volumes in the <b>ZFS</b> root pool. By default, the swap area size is based on 1/2 the size
       of physical memory up to 2 Gbytes. The size of the dump device depends on the  kernel's  requirements  at
       installation time. Separate <b>ZFS</b> volumes must be used for the swap area and dump devices. Do not swap to a
       file on a <b>ZFS</b> file system. A <b>ZFS</b> swap file configuration is not supported.

       If  you  need  to change your swap area or dump device after the system is installed or upgraded, use the
       <b><a href="../man1M/swap.1M.html">swap</a></b>(1M) and <b><a href="../man1M/dumpadm.1M.html">dumpadm</a></b>(1M) commands. If you need to change the size of your swap area or dump  device,  see
       the <u>Solaris</u> <u>ZFS</u> <u>Administration</u> <u>Guide</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCOMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       All subcommands that modify state are logged persistently to the pool in their original form.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>?</b>

           Displays a help message.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>create</b> [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>property</u>=<u>value</u>] ... <u>filesystem</u>

           Creates  a  new <b>ZFS</b> file system. The file system is automatically mounted according to the <b>mountpoint</b>
           property inherited from the parent.

           <b>-p</b>

               Creates all the non-existing parent datasets. Datasets created in this manner  are  automatically
               mounted  according to the <b>mountpoint</b> property inherited from their parent. Any property specified
               on the command line using the <b>-o</b> option is ignored. If the target filesystem already exists,  the
               operation completes successfully.

           <b>-o</b> <u>property</u>=<u>value</u>

               Sets the specified property as if the command <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> <u>property</u>=<u>value</u> was invoked at the same time
               the  dataset was created. Any editable <b>ZFS</b> property can also be set at creation time. Multiple <b>-o</b>
               options can be specified. An error results if the same  property  is  specified  in  multiple  <b>-o</b>
               options.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>create</b> [<b>-ps</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>blocksize</u>] [<b>-o</b> <u>property</u>=<u>value</u>] ... <b>-V</b> <u>size</u> <u>volume</u>

           Creates   a   volume   of   the   given   size.   The  volume  is  exported  as  a  block  device  in
           <b>/dev/zvol/{dsk,rdsk}/</b><u>path</u>, where <u>path</u> is the name of the  volume  in  the  <b>ZFS</b>  namespace.  The  size
           represents  the  logical  size  as exported by the device. By default, a reservation of equal size is
           created.

           <u>size</u> is automatically rounded up to the nearest 128 Kbytes to ensure that the volume has an  integral
           number of blocks regardless of <u>blocksize</u>.

           <b>-p</b>

               Creates  all  the non-existing parent datasets. Datasets created in this manner are automatically
               mounted according to the <b>mountpoint</b> property inherited from their parent. Any property  specified
               on  the command line using the <b>-o</b> option is ignored. If the target filesystem already exists, the
               operation completes successfully.

           <b>-s</b>

               Creates a sparse volume with no reservation. See <b>volsize</b> in the  Native  Properties  section  for
               more information about sparse volumes.

           <b>-o</b> <u>property</u>=<u>value</u>

               Sets the specified property as if the <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> <u>property</u>=<u>value</u> command was invoked at the same time
               the  dataset was created. Any editable <b>ZFS</b> property can also be set at creation time. Multiple <b>-o</b>
               options can be specified. An error results if the same  property  is  specified  in  multiple  <b>-o</b>
               options.

           <b>-b</b> <u>blocksize</u>

               Equivalent  to  <b>-o</b>  <b>volblocksize</b>=<u>blocksize</u>.  If  this  option is specified in conjunction with <b>-o</b>
               <b>volblocksize</b>, the resulting behavior is undefined.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>destroy</b> [<b>-rRf</b>] <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>

           Destroys the given dataset. By default, the command unshares any  file  systems  that  are  currently
           shared,  unmounts  any file systems that are currently mounted, and refuses to destroy a dataset that
           has active dependents (children or clones).

           <b>-r</b>

               Recursively destroy all children.

           <b>-R</b>

               Recursively destroy all dependents, including cloned file systems outside the target hierarchy.

           <b>-f</b>

               Force an unmount of any file systems using the <b>unmount</b> <b>-f</b> command. This option has no  effect  on
               non-file systems or unmounted file systems.

           Extreme care should be taken when applying either the <b>-r</b> or the <b>-f</b> options, as they can destroy large
           portions of a pool and cause unexpected behavior for mounted file systems in use.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>destroy</b> [<b>-rRd</b>] <u>snapshot</u>

           The  given  snapshot  is  destroyed immediately if and only if the <b>zfs</b> <b>destroy</b> command without the <b>-d</b>
           option would have destroyed it. Such immediate destruction would occur, for example, if the  snapshot
           had no clones and the user-initiated reference count were zero.

           If  the  snapshot  does not qualify for immediate destruction, it is marked for deferred deletion. In
           this state, it exists as a usable, visible snapshot until both of the preconditions listed above  are
           met, at which point it is destroyed.

           <b>-d</b>

               Defer snapshot deletion.

           <b>-r</b>

               Destroy (or mark for deferred deletion) all snapshots with this name in descendent file systems.

           <b>-R</b>

               Recursively destroy all dependents.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>snapshot</b> [<b>-r</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>property</u>=<u>value</u>] ... <u>filesystem@snapname</u>|<u>volume@snapname</u>

           Creates  a snapshot with the given name. All previous modifications by successful system calls to the
           file system are part of the snapshot. See the "Snapshots" section for details.

           <b>-r</b>

               Recursively create snapshots of all descendent datasets. Snapshots are taken atomically, so  that
               all recursive snapshots correspond to the same moment in time.

           <b>-o</b> <u>property</u>=<u>value</u>

               Sets the specified property; see <b>zfs</b> <b>create</b> for details.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>rollback</b> [<b>-rRf</b>] <u>snapshot</u>

           Roll  back the given dataset to a previous snapshot. When a dataset is rolled back, all data that has
           changed since the snapshot is discarded, and the dataset reverts to the state  at  the  time  of  the
           snapshot.  By default, the command refuses to roll back to a snapshot other than the most recent one.
           In order to do so, all intermediate snapshots must be destroyed by specifying the <b>-r</b> option.

           The <b>-rR</b> options do not recursively destroy the child snapshots of a recursive snapshot. Only the top-
           level recursive snapshot is destroyed by either of these options. To completely roll back a recursive
           snapshot, you must rollback the individual child snapshots.

           <b>-r</b>

               Recursively destroy any snapshots more recent than the one specified.

           <b>-R</b>

               Recursively destroy any more recent snapshots, as well as any clones of those snapshots.

           <b>-f</b>

               Used with the <b>-R</b> option to force an unmount of any clone file systems that are to be destroyed.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>clone</b> [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>property</u>=<u>value</u>] ... <u>snapshot</u> <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>

           Creates a clone of the given snapshot. See the "Clones" section for details. The target  dataset  can
           be located anywhere in the <b>ZFS</b> hierarchy, and is created as the same type as the original.

           <b>-p</b>

               Creates  all  the non-existing parent datasets. Datasets created in this manner are automatically
               mounted according to  the  <b>mountpoint</b>  property  inherited  from  their  parent.  If  the  target
               filesystem or volume already exists, the operation completes successfully.

           <b>-o</b> <u>property</u>=<u>value</u>

               Sets the specified property; see <b>zfs</b> <b>create</b> for details.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>promote</b> <u>clone-filesystem</u>

           Promotes  a  clone  file  system  to  no  longer be dependent on its "origin" snapshot. This makes it
           possible to destroy the file  system  that  the  clone  was  created  from.  The  clone  parent-child
           dependency  relationship is reversed, so that the origin file system becomes a clone of the specified
           file system.

           The snapshot that was cloned, and any snapshots previous to this  snapshot,  are  now  owned  by  the
           promoted clone. The space they use moves from the origin file system to the promoted clone, so enough
           space  must  be available to accommodate these snapshots. No new space is consumed by this operation,
           but the space accounting is adjusted. The promoted clone must not have any conflicting snapshot names
           of its own. The <b>rename</b> subcommand can be used to rename any conflicting snapshots.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>rename</b> <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>|<u>snapshot</u>
       <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>|<u>snapshot</u>
       <b>zfs</b> <b>rename</b> [<b>-p</b>] <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u> <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>

           Renames the given dataset. The new target can be located anywhere in  the  <b>ZFS</b>  hierarchy,  with  the
           exception  of  snapshots. Snapshots can only be renamed within the parent file system or volume. When
           renaming a snapshot, the parent file system of the snapshot does not need to be specified as part  of
           the  second  argument.  Renamed  file  systems  can  inherit new mount points, in which case they are
           unmounted and remounted at the new mount point.

           <b>-p</b>

               Creates all the nonexistent parent datasets. Datasets created in this  manner  are  automatically
               mounted according to the <b>mountpoint</b> property inherited from their parent.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>rename</b> <b>-r</b> <u>snapshot</u> <u>snapshot</u>

           Recursively  rename the snapshots of all descendent datasets. Snapshots are the only dataset that can
           be renamed recursively.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>list</b> [<b>-r</b>|<b>-d</b> <u>depth</u>] [<b>-H</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>property</u>[,<u>...</u>]] [ <b>-t</b> <u>type</u>[,<u>...</u>]] [ <b>-s</b> <u>property</u> ] ... [ <b>-S</b> <u>property</u> ] ...
       [<u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>|<u>snapshot</u>] ...

           Lists the property information for the given datasets in tabular form. If  specified,  you  can  list
           property  information by the absolute pathname or the relative pathname. By default, all file systems
           and volumes are displayed. Snapshots are displayed if the <b>listsnaps</b> property is <b>on</b>  (the  default  is
           <b>off</b>) . The following fields are displayed, <b>name,used,available,referenced,mountpoint</b>.

           <b>-H</b>

               Used  for  scripting  mode.  Do  not print headers and separate fields by a single tab instead of
               arbitrary white space.

           <b>-r</b>

               Recursively display any children of the dataset on the command line.

           <b>-d</b> <u>depth</u>

               Recursively display any children of the dataset, limiting the recursion to <u>depth</u>. A  depth  of  <b>1</b>
               will display only the dataset and its direct children.

           <b>-o</b> <u>property</u>

               A comma-separated list of properties to display. The property must be:

                   o      One of the properties described in the "Native Properties" section

                   o      A user property

                   o      The value <b>name</b> to display the dataset name

                   o      The value <b>space</b> to display space usage properties on file systems and volumes. This is
                          a  shortcut  for specifying <b>-o</b> <b>name,avail,used,usedsnap,usedds,usedrefreserv,usedchild</b>
                          <b>-t</b> <b>filesystem,volume</b> syntax.

           <b>-s</b> <u>property</u>

               A property for sorting the output by column  in  ascending  order  based  on  the  value  of  the
               property.  The  property  must be one of the properties described in the "Properties" section, or
               the special value <b>name</b> to sort by the dataset name. Multiple properties can be specified  at  one
               time  using multiple <b>-s</b> property options. Multiple <b>-s</b> options are evaluated from left to right in
               decreasing order of importance.

               The following is a list of sorting criteria:

                   o      Numeric types sort in numeric order.

                   o      String types sort in alphabetical order.

                   o      Types inappropriate for a row sort that row to the literal bottom, regardless  of  the
                          specified ordering.

                   o      If no sorting options are specified the existing behavior of <b>zfs</b> <b>list</b> is preserved.

           <b>-S</b> <u>property</u>

               Same as the <b>-s</b> option, but sorts by property in descending order.

           <b>-t</b> <u>type</u>

               A  comma-separated  list of types to display, where <u>type</u> is one of <b>filesystem</b>, <b>snapshot</b> , <b>volume</b>,
               or <b>all</b>. For example, specifying <b>-t</b> <b>snapshot</b> displays only snapshots.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> <u>property</u>=<u>value</u> <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>|<u>snapshot</u> ...

           Sets the property to the given value for each dataset. Only some properties can be  edited.  See  the
           "Properties"  section  for  more  information  on  what  properties can be set and acceptable values.
           Numeric values can be specified as exact values, or in a human-readable form with a suffix of  <b>B</b>,  <b>K</b>,
           <b>M</b>,  <b>G</b>,  <b>T</b>,  <b>P</b>,  <b>E</b>,  <b>Z</b> (for bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, petabytes, exabytes, or
           zettabytes, respectively). User properties can be set on snapshots. For  more  information,  see  the
           "User Properties" section.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>get</b> [<b>-r</b>|<b>-d</b> <u>depth</u>] [<b>-Hp</b>] [<b>-o</b> <b>all</b> | <u>field</u>[,...] [<b>-s</b> <u>source</u>[,...]] <b>all</b> | <u>property</u>[,...]
       <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>|<u>snapshot</u> ...

           Displays  properties  for the given datasets. If no datasets are specified, then the command displays
           properties for all datasets on the system. For each property, the following columns are displayed:

                 name      Dataset name
                  property  Property name
                  value     Property value
                  source    Property source. Can either be local, default,
                            temporary, inherited, or none (-).

           All columns except the <b>RECEIVED</b> column are displayed by default; specify particular or  all  columns,
           using  the  <b>-o</b>  option.  This  command takes a comma-separated list of properties as described in the
           "Native Properties" and "User Properties" sections.

           The special value <b>all</b> can be used to display all properties that apply to the  given  dataset's  type
           (filesystem, volume, or snapshot).

           <b>-r</b>

               Recursively display properties for any children.

           <b>-d</b> <u>depth</u>

               Recursively  display  any  children of the dataset, limiting the recursion to <u>depth</u>. A depth of <b>1</b>
               will display only the dataset and its direct children.

           <b>-H</b>

               Display output in a form more easily parsed by scripts. Any headers are omitted, and  fields  are
               explicitly separated by a single tab instead of an arbitrary amount of space.

           <b>-o</b> <u>field</u>

               Set of fields to display. One or more of:

                 name,property,value,received,source

               Present multiple fields as a comma-separated list. The default value is:

                 name,property,value,source

               The keyword <b>all</b> specifies all sources.

           <b>-s</b> <u>source</u>

               A  comma-separated  list  of sources to display. Those properties coming from a source other than
               those in this list are ignored. Each source must be one of the following:

                 local,default,inherited,temporary,received,none

               The default value is all sources.

           <b>-p</b>

               Display numbers in parseable (exact) values.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>inherit</b> [<b>-rS</b>] <u>property</u> <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>|<u>snapshot</u> ...

           Clears the specified property, causing it to be inherited from an ancestor. If no  ancestor  has  the
           property  set,  then the default value is used. See the "Properties" section for a listing of default
           values, and details on which properties can be inherited.

           <b>-r</b>

               Recursively inherit the given property for all children.

           <b>-S</b>

               Revert to the received property value, if any. If the property does not have  a  received  value,
               the behavior of <b>zfs</b> <b>inherit</b> <b>-S</b> is the same as <b>zfs</b> <b>inherit</b> without <b>-S</b>. If the property does have a
               received  value,  <b>zfs</b> <b>inherit</b> masks the received value with the inherited value until <b>zfs</b> <b>inherit</b>
               <b>-S</b> reverts to the received value.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>upgrade</b> [<b>-v</b>]

           Displays a list of file systems that are not the most recent version.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>upgrade</b> [<b>-r</b>] [<b>-V</b> <u>version</u>] [<b>-a</b> | <u>filesystem</u>]

           Upgrades file systems to a new on-disk version. Once this is done, the file systems will no longer be
           accessible on systems running older versions of the software. <b>zfs</b> <b>send</b>  streams  generated  from  new
           snapshots of these file systems cannot be accessed on systems running older versions of the software.

           In general, the file system version is independent of the pool version. See <b><a href="../man1M/zpool.1M.html">zpool</a></b>(1M) for information
           on the <b>zpool</b> <b>upgrade</b> command.

           In  some  cases,  the  file system version and the pool version are interrelated and the pool version
           must be upgraded before the file system version can be upgraded.

           <b>-a</b>

               Upgrade all file systems on all imported pools.

           <u>filesystem</u>

               Upgrade the specified file system.

           <b>-r</b>

               Upgrade the specified file system and all descendent file systems

           <b>-V</b> <u>version</u>

               Upgrade to the specified <u>version</u>. If the <b>-V</b> flag is not specified, this command upgrades  to  the
               most  recent version. This option can only be used to increase the version number, and only up to
               the most recent version supported by this software.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>userspace</b> [<b>-niHp</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>field</u>[,...]] [<b>-sS</b> <u>field</u>]... [<b>-t</b> <u>type</u> [,...]] <u>filesystem</u> | <u>snapshot</u>

           Displays space consumed by, and quotas on, each user in the specified filesystem  or  snapshot.  This
           corresponds to the <b>userused@</b><u>user</u> and <b>userquota@</b><u>user</u> properties.

           <b>-n</b>

               Print numeric ID instead of user/group name.

           <b>-H</b>

               Do not print headers, use tab-delimited output.

           <b>-p</b>

               Use exact (parseable) numeric output.

           <b>-o</b> <u>field</u>[,...]

               Display  only the specified fields from the following set, <b>type,name,used,quota</b>.The default is to
               display all fields.

           <b>-s</b> <u>field</u>

               Sort output by this field. The <u>s</u> and <u>S</u> flags may be specified multiple times to sort first by one
               field, then by another. The default is <b>-s</b> <b>type</b> <b>-s</b> <b>name</b>.

           <b>-S</b> <u>field</u>

               Sort by this field in reverse order. See <b>-s</b>.

           <b>-t</b> <u>type</u>[,...]

               Print only the specified types from the following set, <b>all,posixuser,smbuser,posixgroup,smbgroup</b>.

               The default is <b>-t</b> <b>posixuser,smbuser</b>

               The default can be changed to include group types.

           <b>-i</b>

               Translate SID to POSIX ID. The POSIX ID may be ephemeral  if  no  mapping  exists.  Normal  POSIX
               interfaces  (for  example,  <b><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></b>(2), <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b>) perform this translation, so the <b>-i</b> option allows the
               output from <b>zfs</b> <b>userspace</b> to be compared directly with those utilities. However, <b>-i</b> may  lead  to
               confusion  if  some  files  were  created  by  an SMB user before a SMB-to-POSIX name mapping was
               established. In such a case, some files are owned by the SMB entity and some by the POSIX entity.
               However, the <b>-i</b> option will report that the POSIX entity has the total usage and quota for both.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>groupspace</b> [<b>-niHp</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>field</u>[,...]] [<b>-sS</b> <u>field</u>]... [<b>-t</b> <u>type</u> [,...]] <u>filesystem</u> | <u>snapshot</u>

           Displays space consumed by, and quotas on, each group in the specified filesystem or  snapshot.  This
           subcommand  is  identical  to  <b>zfs</b>  <b>userspace</b>,  except  that  the  default  types  to  display are <b>-t</b>
           <b>posixgroup,smbgroup</b>.

             -

       <b>zfs</b> <b>mount</b>

           Displays all <b>ZFS</b> file systems currently mounted.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>mount</b> [<b>-vO</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>options</u>] <b>-a</b> | <u>filesystem</u>

           Mounts <b>ZFS</b> file systems. Invoked automatically as part of the boot process.

           <b>-o</b> <u>options</u>

               An optional, comma-separated list of mount options to use temporarily for  the  duration  of  the
               mount. See the "Temporary Mount Point Properties" section for details.

           <b>-O</b>

               Perform an overlay mount. See <b><a href="../man1M/mount.1M.html">mount</a></b>(1M) for more information.

           <b>-v</b>

               Report mount progress.

           <b>-a</b>

               Mount all available <b>ZFS</b> file systems. Invoked automatically as part of the boot process.

           <u>filesystem</u>

               Mount the specified filesystem.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>unmount</b> [<b>-f</b>] <b>-a</b> | <u>filesystem</u>|<u>mountpoint</u>

           Unmounts currently mounted <b>ZFS</b> file systems. Invoked automatically as part of the shutdown process.

           <b>-f</b>

               Forcefully unmount the file system, even if it is currently in use.

           <b>-a</b>

               Unmount all available <b>ZFS</b> file systems. Invoked automatically as part of the boot process.

           <u>filesystem</u>|<u>mountpoint</u>

               Unmount the specified filesystem. The command can also be given a path to a <b>ZFS</b> file system mount
               point on the system.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>share</b> <b>-a</b> | <u>filesystem</u>

           Shares available <b>ZFS</b> file systems.

           <b>-a</b>

               Share all available <b>ZFS</b> file systems. Invoked automatically as part of the boot process.

           <u>filesystem</u>

               Share  the  specified  filesystem according to the <b>sharenfs</b> and <b>sharesmb</b> properties. File systems
               are shared when the <b>sharenfs</b> or <b>sharesmb</b> property is set.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>unshare</b> <b>-a</b> | <u>filesystem</u>|<u>mountpoint</u>

           Unshares currently shared <b>ZFS</b> file systems. This is invoked automatically as  part  of  the  shutdown
           process.

           <b>-a</b>

               Unshare all available <b>ZFS</b> file systems. Invoked automatically as part of the boot process.

           <u>filesystem</u>|<u>mountpoint</u>

               Unshare  the  specified  filesystem.  The  command  can also be given a path to a <b>ZFS</b> file system
               shared on the system.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>send</b> [<b>-DvRp</b>] [<b>-</b>[<b>iI</b>] <u>snapshot</u>] <u>snapshot</u>

           Creates a stream representation of the second <u>snapshot</u>, which is  written  to  standard  output.  The
           output can be redirected to a file or to a different system (for example, using <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1). By default, a
           full stream is generated.

           <b>-D</b>

               Perform  <b>dedup</b>  processing on the stream. Deduplicated streams cannot be received on systems that
               do not support the stream deduplication feature.

           <b>-i</b> <u>snapshot</u>

               Generate an incremental stream from the first <u>snapshot</u> to the second  <u>snapshot</u>.  The  incremental
               source  (the  first  <u>snapshot</u>)  can  be specified as the last component of the snapshot name (for
               example, the part after the <b>@</b>), and it is assumed to be from the same file system as  the  second
               <u>snapshot</u>.

               If  the  destination  is  a  clone,  the  source  may be the origin snapshot, which must be fully
               specified (for example, <b>pool/fs@origin</b>, not just <b>@origin</b>).

           <b>-I</b> <u>snapshot</u>

               Generate a stream package that sends all intermediary snapshots from the first  snapshot  to  the
               second  snapshot.  For  example, <b>-I</b> <b>@a</b> <b>fs@d</b> is similar to <b>-i</b> <b>@a</b> <b>fs@b;</b> <b>-i</b> <b>@b</b> <b>fs@c;</b> <b>-i</b> <b>@c</b> <b>fs@d</b>. The
               incremental source snapshot may be specified as with the <b>-i</b> option.

           <b>-R</b>

               Generate a replication stream package, which will replicate the  specified  filesystem,  and  all
               descendent  file  systems,  up  to  the named snapshot. When received, all properties, snapshots,
               descendent file systems, and clones are preserved.

               If the <b>-i</b> or <b>-I</b> flags are used in conjunction with the <b>-R</b> flag, an incremental replication stream
               is generated. The current values of properties, and current snapshot and file  system  names  are
               set  when  the  stream  is  received.  If  the <b>-F</b> flag is specified when this stream is received,
               snapshots and file systems that do not exist on the sending side are destroyed.

           <b>-p</b>

               Send properties.

           <b>-v</b>

               Print verbose information about the stream package generated.

           The format of the stream is committed. You will be able to receive your streams on future versions of
           <b>ZFS</b>.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>receive</b> [<b>-vnFu</b>] <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>|<u>snapshot</u>
       <b>zfs</b> <b>receive</b> [<b>-vnFu</b>] [<b>-d</b> | <b>-e</b>] <u>filesystem</u>

           Creates a snapshot whose contents are as specified in the stream provided on  standard  input.  If  a
           full stream is received, then a new file system is created as well. Streams are created using the <b>zfs</b>
           <b>send</b>  subcommand,  which  by  default creates a full stream. <b>zfs</b> <b>recv</b> can be used as an alias for <b>zfs</b>
           <b>receive</b>.

           If an incremental stream is received, then the destination file system must already  exist,  and  its
           most  recent  snapshot  must match the incremental stream's source. For <b>zvols</b>, the destination device
           link is destroyed and recreated,  which  means  the  <b>zvol</b>  cannot  be  accessed  during  the  <b>receive</b>
           operation.

           When  a  snapshot  replication  package  stream that is generated by using the <b>zfs</b> <b>send</b> <b>-R</b> command is
           received, any snapshots that do not exist on the sending location are  destroyed  by  using  the  <b>zfs</b>
           <b>destroy</b> <b>-d</b> command.

           The name of the snapshot (and file system, if a full stream is received) that this subcommand creates
           depends on the argument type and the <b>-d</b> or <b>-e</b> option.

           If  the  argument  is  a  snapshot name, the specified <u>snapshot</u> is created. If the argument is a file
           system or volume name, a snapshot with the same name as the  sent  snapshot  is  created  within  the
           specified  <u>filesystem</u> or <u>volume</u>. If the <b>-d</b> or <b>-e</b> option is specified, the snapshot name is determined
           by appending the sent snapshot's name to the specified filesystem. If the <b>-d</b> option is specified, all
           but the pool name of the sent snapshot path is  appended  (for  example,  <b>b/c@1</b>  appended  from  sent
           snapshot  <b>a/b/c@1</b>),  and  if  the  <b>-e</b> option is specified, only the tail of the sent snapshot path is
           appended (for example, <b>c@1</b> appended from sent snapshot <b>a/b/c@1</b>). In the case of <b>-d</b>, any file  systems
           needed to replicate the path of the sent snapshot are created within the specified file system.

           <b>-d</b>

               Use  all but the first element of the sent snapshot path (all but the pool name) to determine the
               name of the new snapshot as described in the paragraph above.

           <b>-e</b>

               Use the last element of the sent snapshot path to determine the  name  of  the  new  snapshot  as
               described in the paragraph above.

           <b>-u</b>

               File system that is associated with the received stream is not mounted.

           <b>-v</b>

               Print  verbose  information  about  the  stream  and  the  time  required  to perform the receive
               operation.

           <b>-n</b>

               Do not actually receive the stream. This can be useful in  conjunction  with  the  <b>-v</b>  option  to
               verify the name the receive operation would use.

           <b>-F</b>

               Force  a  rollback  of  the file system to the most recent snapshot before performing the receive
               operation. If receiving an incremental replication stream (for example, one generated by <b>zfs</b> <b>send</b>
               <b>-R</b> <b>-[iI]</b>), destroy snapshots and file systems that do not exist on the sending side.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> <u>filesystem</u> | <u>volume</u>

           Displays permissions that have been delegated on the specified filesystem or volume.  See  the  other
           forms of <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> for more information.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> [<b>-ldug</b>] "<u>everyone</u>"|<u>user</u>|<u>group</u>[,...] <u>perm</u>|@<u>setname</u>[,...] <u>filesystem</u>| <u>volume</u>
       <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> [<b>-ld</b>] <b>-e</b> <u>perm</u>|@<u>setname</u>[,...] <u>filesystem</u> | <u>volume</u>

           Delegates <b>ZFS</b> administration permission for the file systems to non-privileged users.

           <b>[-ug</b>] "<u>everyone</u>"|<u>user</u>|<u>group</u>[,...]

               Specifies  to  whom the permissions are delegated. Multiple entities can be specified as a comma-
               separated list. If neither of the <b>-ug</b> options are specified, then  the  argument  is  interpreted
               preferentially  as  the  keyword  "everyone", then as a user name, and lastly as a group name. To
               specify a user or group named "everyone", use the <b>-u</b> or <b>-g</b> options. To specify a group  with  the
               same name as a user, use the <b>-g</b> options.

           <b>[-e</b>] <u>perm</u>|@<u>setname</u>[,...]

               Specifies  that the permissions be delegated to "everyone." Multiple permissions may be specified
               as a comma-separated list. Permission names are the same as <b>ZFS</b> subcommand  and  property  names.
               See  the  property  list  below.  Property  set  names,  which begin with an at sign (<b>@</b>) , may be
               specified. See the <b>-s</b> form below for details.

           <b>[-ld</b>] <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>

               Specifies where the permissions are delegated. If neither of the <b>-ld</b> options  are  specified,  or
               both  are,  then  the  permissions  are  allowed  for  the  file system or volume, and all of its
               descendents. If only the <b>-l</b> option is used, then is allowed "locally" only for the specified file
               system. If only the <b>-d</b> option is used, then is allowed only for the descendent file systems.

       Permissions are generally the ability to use a <b>ZFS</b> subcommand or change a  <b>ZFS</b>  property.  The  following
       permissions are available:

       <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> <b>-c</b> <u>perm</u>|@<u>setname</u>[,...] <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>

           Sets  "create time" permissions. These permissions are granted (locally) to the creator of any newly-
           created descendent file system.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> <b>-s</b> @<u>setname</u> <u>perm</u>|@<u>setname</u>[,...] <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>

           Defines or adds permissions to a permission set. The set can be used by other <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> commands  for
           the  specified  file  system and its descendents. Sets are evaluated dynamically, so changes to a set
           are immediately reflected. Permission sets follow the same naming restrictions as ZFS  file  systems,
           but the name must begin with an "at sign" (<b>@</b>), and can be no more than 64 characters long.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>unallow</b> [<b>-rldug</b>] "<u>everyone</u>"|<u>user</u>|<u>group</u>[,...] [<u>perm</u>|@<u>setname</u>[, ...]] <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>
       <b>zfs</b> <b>unallow</b> [<b>-rld</b>] <b>-e</b> [<u>perm</u>|@<u>setname</u> [,...]] <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>
       <b>zfs</b> <b>unallow</b> [<b>-r</b>] <b>-c</b> [<u>perm</u>|@<u>setname</u>[,...]]
       <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>

           Removes  permissions  that  were  granted  with  the <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> command. No permissions are explicitly
           denied, so other permissions granted are still in effect. For example, if the permission  is  granted
           by  an ancestor. If no permissions are specified, then all permissions for the specified <u>user</u>, <u>group</u>,
           or <u>everyone</u> are removed. Specifying "everyone" (or using the <b>-e</b> option) only removes the  permissions
           that  were  granted  to  "everyone",  not all permissions for every user and group. See the <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b>
           command for a description of the <b>-ldugec</b> options.

           <b>-r</b>

               Recursively remove the permissions from this file system and all descendents.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>unallow</b> [<b>-r</b>] <b>-s</b> @<u>setname</u> [<u>perm</u>|@<u>setname</u>[,...]]
       <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>

           Removes permissions from a permission set. If no permissions are specified, then all permissions  are
           removed, thus removing the set entirely.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>hold</b> [<b>-r</b>] <u>tag</u> <u>snapshot</u>...

           Adds  a  single  reference, named with the <u>tag</u> argument, to the specified snapshot or snapshots. Each
           snapshot has its own tag namespace, and tags must be unique within that space.

           If a hold exists on a snapshot, attempts to destroy that snapshot by using the  <b>zfs</b>  <b>destroy</b>  command
           return <b>EBUSY</b>.

           <b>-r</b>

               Specifies  that  a  hold  with  the  given  tag  is  applied  recursively to the snapshots of all
               descendent file systems.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>holds</b> [<b>-r</b>] <u>snapshot</u>...

           Lists all existing user references for the given snapshot or snapshots.

           <b>-r</b>

               Lists the holds that are set on the named descendent snapshots, in addition to listing the  holds
               on the named snapshot.

       <b>zfs</b> <b>release</b> [<b>-r</b>] <u>tag</u> <u>snapshot</u>...

           Removes  a  single  reference, named with the <u>tag</u> argument, from the specified snapshot or snapshots.
           The tag must already exist for each snapshot.

           If a hold exists on a snapshot, attempts to destroy that snapshot by using the  <b>zfs</b>  <b>destroy</b>  command
           return <b>EBUSY</b>.

           <b>-r</b>

               Recursively releases a hold with the given tag on the snapshots of all descendent file systems.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Example</b> <b>1</b> Creating a ZFS File System Hierarchy

       The  following  commands  create a file system named <b>pool/home</b> and a file system named <b>pool/home/bob</b>. The
       mount point <b>/export/home</b> is set for the parent file system, and is automatically inherited by  the  child
       file system.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>create</b> <b>pool/home</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> <b>mountpoint=/export/home</b> <b>pool/home</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>create</b> <b>pool/home/bob</b>

       <b>Example</b> <b>2</b> Creating a ZFS Snapshot

       The  following  command  creates  a  snapshot  named <b>yesterday</b>. This snapshot is mounted on demand in the
       <b>.zfs/snapshot</b> directory at the root of the <b>pool/home/bob</b> file system.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>pool/home/bob@yesterday</b>

       <b>Example</b> <b>3</b> Creating and Destroying Multiple Snapshots

       The following command creates snapshots named <b>yesterday</b> of <b>pool/home</b>  and  all  of  its  descendent  file
       systems.  Each  snapshot  is  mounted  on  demand  in the <b>.zfs/snapshot</b> directory at the root of its file
       system. The second command destroys the newly created snapshots.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>-r</b> <b>pool/home@yesterday</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>-r</b> <b>pool/home@yesterday</b>

       <b>Example</b> <b>4</b> Disabling and Enabling File System Compression

       The following command disables the <b>compression</b> property for all file systems under  <b>pool/home</b>.  The  next
       command explicitly enables <b>compression</b> for <b>pool/home/anne</b>.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> <b>compression=off</b> <b>pool/home</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> <b>compression=on</b> <b>pool/home/anne</b>

       <b>Example</b> <b>5</b> Listing ZFS Datasets

       The following command lists all active file systems and volumes in the system. Snapshots are displayed if
       the <b>listsnaps</b> property is <b>on</b>. The default is <b>off</b>. See <b><a href="../man1M/zpool.1M.html">zpool</a></b>(1M) for more information on pool properties.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>list</b>
            NAME                      USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
            pool                      450K   457G    18K  /pool
            pool/home                 315K   457G    21K  /export/home
            pool/home/anne             18K   457G    18K  /export/home/anne
            pool/home/bob             276K   457G   276K  /export/home/bob

       <b>Example</b> <b>6</b> Setting a Quota on a ZFS File System

       The following command sets a quota of 50 Gbytes for <b>pool/home/bob</b>.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> <b>quota=50G</b> <b>pool/home/bob</b>

       <b>Example</b> <b>7</b> Listing ZFS Properties

       The following command lists all properties for <b>pool/home/bob</b>.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>pool/home/bob</b>

       The following command gets a single property value.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>get</b> <b>-H</b> <b>-o</b> <b>value</b> <b>compression</b> <b>pool/home/bob</b>
         on

       The following command lists all properties with local settings for <b>pool/home/bob</b>.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>get</b> <b>-r</b> <b>-s</b> <b>local</b> <b>-o</b> <b>name,property,value</b> <b>all</b> <b>pool/home/bob</b>
         NAME           PROPERTY              VALUE
         pool/home/bob  quota                 20G
         pool/home/bob  compression           on

       <b>Example</b> <b>8</b> Rolling Back a ZFS File System

       The  following  command  reverts the contents of <b>pool/home/anne</b> to the snapshot named <b>yesterday</b>, deleting
       all intermediate snapshots.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>rollback</b> <b>-r</b> <b>pool/home/anne@yesterday</b>

       <b>Example</b> <b>9</b> Creating a ZFS Clone

       The  following  command  creates  a  writable  file  system  whose  initial  contents  are  the  same  as
       <b>pool/home/bob@yesterday</b>.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>clone</b> <b>pool/home/bob@yesterday</b> <b>pool/clone</b>

       <b>Example</b> <b>10</b> Promoting a ZFS Clone

       The following commands illustrate how to test out changes to a file system, and then replace the original
       file system with the changed one, using clones, clone promotion, and renaming:

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>create</b> <b>pool/project/production</b>
           populate /pool/project/production with data
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>pool/project/production@today</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>clone</b> <b>pool/project/production@today</b> <b>pool/project/beta</b>
         make changes to /pool/project/beta and test them
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>promote</b> <b>pool/project/beta</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>rename</b> <b>pool/project/production</b> <b>pool/project/legacy</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>rename</b> <b>pool/project/beta</b> <b>pool/project/production</b>
         once the legacy version is no longer needed, it can be destroyed
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>pool/project/legacy</b>

       <b>Example</b> <b>11</b> Inheriting ZFS Properties

       The following command causes <b>pool/home/bob</b> and <b>pool/home/anne</b> to inherit the <b>checksum</b> property from their
       parent.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>inherit</b> <b>checksum</b> <b>pool/home/bob</b> <b>pool/home/anne</b>

       <b>Example</b> <b>12</b> Remotely Replicating ZFS Data

       The  following  commands send a full stream and then an incremental stream to a remote machine, restoring
       them into <b>poolB/received/fs@a</b>and <b>poolB/received/fs@b</b>, respectively. <b>poolB</b> must contain  the  file  system
       <b>poolB/received</b>, and must not initially contain <b>poolB/received/fs</b>.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>send</b> <b>pool/fs@a</b> <b>|</b> <b>\</b>
            <b>ssh</b> <b>host</b> <b>zfs</b> <b>receive</b> <b>poolB/received/fs@a</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>send</b> <b>-i</b> <b>a</b> <b>pool/fs@b</b> <b>|</b> <b>ssh</b> <b>host</b> <b>\</b>
            <b>zfs</b> <b>receive</b> <b>poolB/received/fs</b>

       <b>Example</b> <b>13</b> Using the <b>zfs</b> <b>receive</b> <b>-d</b> Option

       The  following  command  sends a full stream of <b>poolA/fsA/fsB@snap</b> to a remote machine, receiving it into
       <b>poolB/received/fsA/fsB@snap</b>. The <b>fsA/fsB@snap</b> portion of the received snapshot's name is determined  from
       the  name  of the sent snapshot. <b>poolB</b> must contain the file system <b>poolB/received</b>. If <b>poolB/received/fsA</b>
       does not exist, it is created as an empty file system.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>send</b> <b>poolA/fsA/fsB@snap</b> <b>|</b> <b>\</b>
            <b>ssh</b> <b>host</b> <b>zfs</b> <b>receive</b> <b>-d</b> <b>poolB/received</b>

       <b>Example</b> <b>14</b> Setting User Properties

       The following example sets the user-defined <b>com.example:department</b> property for a dataset.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> <b>com.example:department=12345</b> <b>tank/accounting</b>

       <b>Example</b> <b>15</b> Creating a ZFS Volume as an iSCSI Target Device

       The following example shows how to create a <b>ZFS</b> volume as an <b>iSCSI</b> target.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>create</b> <b>-V</b> <b>2g</b> <b>pool/volumes/vol1</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> <b>shareiscsi=on</b> <b>pool/volumes/vol1</b>
         # <b>iscsitadm</b> <b>list</b> <b>target</b>
         Target: pool/volumes/vol1
          iSCSI Name:
          iqn.1986-03.com.sun:02:7b4b02a6-3277-eb1b-e686-a24762c52a8c
          Connections: 0

       After the <b>iSCSI</b> target is created, set up the <b>iSCSI</b> initiator. For more  information  about  the  Solaris
       <b>iSCSI</b> initiator, see <b><a href="../man1M/iscsitadm.1M.html">iscsitadm</a></b>(1M).

       <b>Example</b> <b>16</b> Performing a Rolling Snapshot

       The  following  example  shows how to maintain a history of snapshots with a consistent naming scheme. To
       keep a week's worth of snapshots, the user destroys the oldest snapshot, renames the remaining snapshots,
       and then creates a new snapshot, as follows:

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>-r</b> <b>pool/users@7daysago</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>rename</b> <b>-r</b> <b>pool/users@6daysago</b> <b>@7daysago</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>rename</b> <b>-r</b> <b>pool/users@5daysago</b> <b>@6daysago</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>rename</b> <b>-r</b> <b>pool/users@yesterday</b> <b>@5daysago</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>rename</b> <b>-r</b> <b>pool/users@yesterday</b> <b>@4daysago</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>rename</b> <b>-r</b> <b>pool/users@yesterday</b> <b>@3daysago</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>rename</b> <b>-r</b> <b>pool/users@yesterday</b> <b>@2daysago</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>rename</b> <b>-r</b> <b>pool/users@today</b> <b>@yesterday</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>-r</b> <b>pool/users@today</b>

       <b>Example</b> <b>17</b> Setting <b>sharenfs</b> Property Options on a ZFS File System

       The following commands show how to set <b>sharenfs</b> property options to enable <b>rw</b> access  for  a  set  of  <b>IP</b>
       addresses and to enable root access for system <b>neo</b> on the <b>tank/home</b> file system.

         # <b>#</b> <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> <b>sharenfs='rw=@123.123.0.0/16,root=neo'</b> <b>tank/home</b>

       If you are using <b>DNS</b> for host name resolution, specify the fully qualified hostname.

       <b>Example</b> <b>18</b> Delegating ZFS Administration Permissions on a ZFS Dataset

       The  following  example  shows how to set permissions so that user <b>cindys</b> can create, destroy, mount, and
       take snapshots on <b>tank/cindys</b>. The permissions on <b>tank/cindys</b> are also displayed.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> <b>cindys</b> <b>create,destroy,mount,snapshot</b> <b>tank/cindys</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> <b>tank/cindys</b>
         -------------------------------------------------------------
         Local+Descendent permissions on (tank/cindys)
                   user cindys create,destroy,mount,snapshot
         -------------------------------------------------------------

       Because the <b>tank/cindys</b> mount point permission is set to 755 by default, user <b>cindys</b> will  be  unable  to
       mount  file  systems under <b>tank/cindys</b>. Set an <b>ACL</b> similar to the following syntax to provide mount point
       access:

         # <b>chmod</b> <b>A+user:cindys:add_subdirectory:allow</b> <b>/tank/cindys</b>

       <b>Example</b> <b>19</b> Delegating Create Time Permissions on a ZFS Dataset

       The following example shows how to grant anyone in the group <b>staff</b> to create file systems in  <b>tank/users</b>.
       This  syntax  also  allows staff members to destroy their own file systems, but not destroy anyone else's
       file system. The permissions on <b>tank/users</b> are also displayed.

         # <b>#</b> <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> <b>staff</b> <b>create,mount</b> <b>tank/users</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> <b>-c</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>tank/users</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> <b>tank/users</b>
         -------------------------------------------------------------
         Create time permissions on (tank/users)
                   create,destroy
         Local+Descendent permissions on (tank/users)
                   group staff create,mount
         -------------------------------------------------------------

       <b>Example</b> <b>20</b> Defining and Granting a Permission Set on a ZFS Dataset

       The following example shows how to define and grant a permission set on the <b>tank/users</b> file  system.  The
       permissions on <b>tank/users</b> are also displayed.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> <b>-s</b> <b>@pset</b> <b>create,destroy,snapshot,mount</b> <b>tank/users</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> <b>staff</b> <b>@pset</b> <b>tank/users</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> <b>tank/users</b>
         -------------------------------------------------------------
         Permission sets on (tank/users)
                 @pset create,destroy,mount,snapshot
         Create time permissions on (tank/users)
                 create,destroy
         Local+Descendent permissions on (tank/users)
                 group staff @pset,create,mount
         -------------------------------------------------------------

       <b>Example</b> <b>21</b> Delegating Property Permissions on a ZFS Dataset

       The  following  example  shows to grant the ability to set quotas and reservations on the <b>users/home</b> file
       system. The permissions on <b>users/home</b> are also displayed.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> <b>cindys</b> <b>quota,reservation</b> <b>users/home</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> <b>users/home</b>
         -------------------------------------------------------------
         Local+Descendent permissions on (users/home)
                 user cindys quota,reservation
         -------------------------------------------------------------
         cindys% <b>zfs</b> <b>set</b> <b>quota=10G</b> <b>users/home/marks</b>
         cindys% <b>zfs</b> <b>get</b> <b>quota</b> <b>users/home/marks</b>
         NAME              PROPERTY  VALUE             SOURCE
         users/home/marks  quota     10G               local

       <b>Example</b> <b>22</b> Removing ZFS Delegated Permissions on a ZFS Dataset

       The following example shows how to remove the snapshot permission from the <b>staff</b> group on the  <b>tank/users</b>
       file system. The permissions on <b>tank/users</b> are also displayed.

         # <b>zfs</b> <b>unallow</b> <b>staff</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>tank/users</b>
         # <b>zfs</b> <b>allow</b> <b>tank/users</b>
         -------------------------------------------------------------
         Permission sets on (tank/users)
                 @pset create,destroy,mount,snapshot
         Create time permissions on (tank/users)
                 create,destroy
         Local+Descendent permissions on (tank/users)
                 group staff @pset,create,mount
