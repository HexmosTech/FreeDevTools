</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       upsrw - Network UPS Tools device/driver variable administration tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>upsrw</b> [-l] <u>ups</u>

       <b>upsrw</b> -h

       <b>upsrw</b> -s <u>variable</u> [-u <u>username</u>] [-p <u>password</u>] [-w] [-t &lt;timeout&gt;] <u>ups</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>upsrw</b> allows you to view and change the read/write variables inside your UPS. It sends commands via the
       server <b><a href="../man8/upsd.8.html">upsd</a></b>(8) to your driver, which configures the hardware for you. You must use credentials defined in
       <b><a href="../man5/upsd.users.5.html">upsd.users</a></b>(5) file on that data server with appropriate permissions.

       The list of variables that allow you to change their values is based on the capabilities of your UPS
       equipment. Not all models support this feature. Typically, cheaper hardware does not support any of them.
       Run upsrw with a UPS identifier to see what will work for you.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-s</b> <u>variable</u>
           Specify the variable to be changed inside the UPS. For unattended mode such as in shell scripts, use
           the format VAR=VALUE to specify both the variable and the value, for example:

               -s input.transfer.high=129

           Without this argument, upsrw will just display the list of the variables and their possible values.

           Some variables are strings, and can be set to any value within the length limit. Others are
           enumerated types and can only be set to one of those values. Others may be within an allowed range of
           values. Refer to the list to know what’s available in your hardware.

       <b>-l</b>
           Just display the list of the variables and their possible values.

           Same as default activity without <u>-s</u> argument, provided for CLI similarity with other tools.

       <b>-u</b> <u>username</u>
           Set the NUT username for the connection to the server. This is optional, and you will be prompted for
           this when using the -s option if you don’t specify -u on the command line. NUT usernames are defined
           in <b><a href="../man5/upsd.users.5.html">upsd.users</a></b>(5), and are not linked to system usernames.

       <b>-p</b> <u>password</u>
           Set the password to authenticate to the server. This is also optional like -u, and you will be
           prompted for it if necessary.

       <b>-w</b>
           Wait for the completion of setting execution by the driver and return its actual result from the
           device. Note that this feature requires that both <b><a href="../man8/upsd.8.html">upsd</a></b>(8) and the driver support TRACKING (NUT
           version 2.8.0 or higher), or it will otherwise fail.

           The command will also block until an actual result is provided from the driver, or the timeout is
           reached (see <b>-t</b>).

       <b>-t</b> <u>seconds</u>
           Set a timeout when using <b>-w</b>. Defaults to 10 seconds.

       <u>ups</u>
           View or change the settings on this UPS. The format for this option is upsname[@hostname[:port]]. The
           default hostname is "localhost".

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>
           Show the command-line help message.

       <b>-V</b>
           Show NUT version banner. More details may be available if you also export NUT_DEBUG_LEVEL=1 or
           greater verbosity level.

       <b>-W</b> <u>secs</u>
           Set the timeout for initial network connections (by default they are indefinitely non-blocking, or
           until the system interrupts the attempt). Overrides the optional NUT_DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT
           environment variable.

</pre><h4><b>UNATTENDED</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       If you run this program inside a shell script or similar to set variables, you will need to specify all
       of the information on the command line. This means using -s VAR=VALUE, -u and -p. Otherwise it will put
       up a prompt and your program will hang.

       This is not necessary when displaying the list, as the username and password are not required for
       read-only mode.

       Moreover, if you run this program inside a shell script or similar, you should only consider using output
       from stdout, not stderr.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>upsrw</b> can’t set variables on your UPS unless you provide a valid username and password. If you get
       "access denied" errors, make sure that your <b><a href="../man5/upsd.users.5.html">upsd.users</a></b>(5) has an entry for you, and that the username you
       are using has permissions to SET variables.

       <b>upsrw</b> without <u>-w</u> would somewhat confusingly show "OK" meaning just that the data server connection was
       established, and the server did not immediately reject the request due to e.g. unknown driver variable
       name. If you care to know the actual results, do use the -w (-t NUM) option(s) to wait for them.

</pre><h4><b>VALUE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       When using <b>upsrw</b> to modify a numeric float value, that values must be given using decimal (base 10)
       english-based representation, so using a dot, in non-scientific notation. So hexadecimal, exponents, and
       comma for thousands separator are forbidden.

       For example: "1200.20" is valid, while "1,200.20" and "1200,20" are invalid.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       This program used to be called upsct2, which was ambiguous and confusing.
