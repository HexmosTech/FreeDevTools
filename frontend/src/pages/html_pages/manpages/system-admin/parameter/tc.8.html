</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tc</b> is used to configure Traffic Control in the Linux kernel. Traffic Control consists of the following:

       SHAPING
              When traffic is shaped, its rate of transmission is  under  control.  Shaping  may  be  more  than
              lowering  the  available  bandwidth  -  it is also used to smooth out bursts in traffic for better
              network behaviour. Shaping occurs on egress.

       SCHEDULING
              By scheduling the transmission of packets it is possible to improve interactivity for traffic that
              needs it while  still  guaranteeing  bandwidth  to  bulk  transfers.  Reordering  is  also  called
              prioritizing, and happens only on egress.

       POLICING
              Whereas  shaping  deals  with  transmission  of  traffic,  policing  pertains to traffic arriving.
              Policing thus occurs on ingress.

       DROPPING
              Traffic exceeding a set bandwidth may also be dropped forthwith, both on ingress and on egress.

       Processing of traffic is controlled by three kinds of objects: qdiscs, classes and filters.

</pre><h4><b>QDISCS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>qdisc</b> is short for 'queueing discipline' and it is elementary to understanding traffic control.  Whenever
       the  kernel  needs  to  send  a  packet  to an interface, it is <b>enqueued</b> to the qdisc configured for that
       interface. Immediately afterwards, the kernel tries to get as many packets as possible  from  the  qdisc,
       for giving them to the network adaptor driver.

       A  simple  QDISC  is  the  'pfifo' one, which does no processing at all and is a pure First In, First Out
       queue. It does however store traffic when the network interface can't handle it momentarily.

</pre><h4><b>CLASSES</b></h4><pre>
       Some qdiscs can contain classes, which contain further qdiscs - traffic may then be enqueued  in  any  of
       the  inner  qdiscs,  which are within the <b>classes.</b>  When the kernel tries to dequeue a packet from such a
       <b>classful</b> <b>qdisc</b> it can come from any of the classes. A qdisc may for example prioritize certain  kinds  of
       traffic by trying to dequeue from certain classes before others.

</pre><h4><b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       A  <b>filter</b>  is  used  by  a classful qdisc to determine in which class a packet will be enqueued. Whenever
       traffic arrives at a class with subclasses, it needs to be classified. Various methods may be employed to
       do so, one of these are the filters. All filters attached to the class are  called,  until  one  of  them
       returns with a verdict. If no verdict was made, other criteria may be available. This differs per qdisc.

       It is important to notice that filters reside <b>within</b> qdiscs - they are not masters of what happens.

       The available filters are:

       basic  Filter packets based on an ematch expression. See <b><a href="../man8/tc-ematch.8.html">tc-ematch</a></b>(8) for details.

       bpf    Filter packets using (e)BPF, see <b><a href="../man8/tc-bpf.8.html">tc-bpf</a></b>(8) for details.

       cgroup Filter packets based on the control group of their process. See <b><a href="../man8/tc-cgroup.8.html">tc-cgroup</a></b>(8) for details.

       flow, flower
              Flow-based classifiers, filtering packets based on their flow (identified by selectable keys). See
              <b><a href="../man8/tc-flow.8.html">tc-flow</a></b>(8) and <b><a href="../man8/tc-flower.8.html">tc-flower</a></b>(8) for details.

       fw     Filter based on fwmark. Directly maps fwmark value to traffic class. See <b><a href="../man8/tc-fw.8.html">tc-fw</a></b>(8).

       route  Filter packets based on routing table. See <b><a href="../man8/tc-route.8.html">tc-route</a></b>(8) for details.

       u32    Generic  filtering on arbitrary packet data, assisted by syntax to abstract common operations. See
              <b><a href="../man8/tc-u32.8.html">tc-u32</a></b>(8) for details.

       matchall
              Traffic control filter that matches every packet. See <b><a href="../man8/tc-matchall.8.html">tc-matchall</a></b>(8) for details.

</pre><h4><b>QEVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Qdiscs may invoke user-configured actions when certain interesting events take place in the  qdisc.  Each
       qevent  can either be unused, or can have a block attached to it. To this block are then attached filters
       using the "tc block BLOCK_IDX" syntax. The  block  is  executed  when  the  qevent  associated  with  the
       attachment  point  takes  place. For example, packet could be dropped, or delayed, etc., depending on the
       qdisc and the qevent in question.

       For example:

              tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: red limit 500K avpkt 1K \
                 qevent early_drop block 10
              tc filter add block 10 matchall action mirred egress mirror dev eth1

</pre><h4><b>CLASSLESS</b> <b>QDISCS</b></h4><pre>
       The classless qdiscs are:

       choke  CHOKe (CHOose and Keep for responsive  flows,  CHOose  and  Kill  for  unresponsive  flows)  is  a
              classless qdisc designed to both identify and penalize flows that monopolize the queue. CHOKe is a
              variation of RED, and the configuration is similar to RED.

       codel  CoDel  (pronounced  "coddle")  is  an  adaptive "no-knobs" active queue management algorithm (AQM)
              scheme that was developed to address the shortcomings of RED and its variants.

       [p|b]fifo
              Simplest usable qdisc, pure First In, First Out behaviour. Limited in packets or in bytes.

       fq     Fair Queue Scheduler realises TCP pacing and scales to millions of concurrent flows per qdisc.

       fq_codel
              Fair Queuing Controlled Delay is queuing discipline that combines Fair Queuing with the CoDel  AQM
              scheme.  FQ_Codel uses a stochastic model to classify incoming packets into different flows and is
              used to provide a fair share of the bandwidth to all the flows using the queue. Each such flow  is
              managed  by  the  CoDel  queuing  discipline.  Reordering  within  a  flow  is avoided since Codel
              internally uses a FIFO queue.

       fq_pie FQ-PIE (Flow Queuing with Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) is a queuing discipline  that
              combines  Flow  Queuing  with  the PIE AQM scheme. FQ-PIE uses a Jenkins hash function to classify
              incoming packets into different flows and is used to provide a fair share of the bandwidth to  all
              the flows using the qdisc. Each such flow is managed by the PIE algorithm.

       gred   Generalized  Random Early Detection combines multiple RED queues in order to achieve multiple drop
              priorities. This is required to realize Assured Forwarding (RFC 2597).

       hhf    Heavy-Hitter Filter differentiates between small flows and the opposite, heavy-hitters.  The  goal
              is  to  catch  the heavy-hitters and move them to a separate queue with less priority so that bulk
              traffic does not affect the latency of critical traffic.

       ingress
              This is a special qdisc as it applies to incoming traffic on an interface, allowing for it  to  be
              filtered and policed.

       mqprio The  Multiqueue Priority Qdisc is a simple queuing discipline that allows mapping traffic flows to
              hardware queue ranges using priorities and a configurable priority to  traffic  class  mapping.  A
              traffic  class  in  this  context  is  a set of contiguous qdisc classes which map 1:1 to a set of
              hardware exposed queues.

       multiq Multiqueue is a qdisc optimized for devices with  multiple  Tx  queues.  It  has  been  added  for
              hardware  that  wishes  to avoid head-of-line blocking.  It will cycle though the bands and verify
              that the hardware queue associated with the band is not stopped prior to dequeuing a packet.

       netem  Network Emulator is an enhancement of the Linux traffic control facilities that allow one  to  add
              delay, packet loss, duplication and more other characteristics to packets outgoing from a selected
              network interface.

       pfifo_fast
              Standard  qdisc for 'Advanced Router' enabled kernels. Consists of a three-band queue which honors
              Type of Service flags, as well as the priority that may be assigned to a packet.

       pie    Proportional Integral controller-Enhanced (PIE) is a control  theoretic  active  queue  management
              scheme. It is based on the proportional integral controller but aims to control delay.

       red    Random  Early  Detection  simulates  physical congestion by randomly dropping packets when nearing
              configured bandwidth allocation. Well suited to very large bandwidth applications.

       sfb    Stochastic Fair Blue is a classless qdisc to manage congestion  based  on  packet  loss  and  link
              utilization  history while trying to prevent non-responsive flows (i.e. flows that do not react to
              congestion marking or dropped packets) from impacting performance  of  responsive  flows.   Unlike
              RED, where the marking probability has to be configured, BLUE tries to determine the ideal marking
              probability automatically.

       sfq    Stochastic  Fairness  Queueing  reorders queued traffic so each 'session' gets to send a packet in
              turn.

       tbf    The Token Bucket Filter is suited for slowing traffic down to a precisely configured rate.  Scales
              well to large bandwidths.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURING</b> <b>CLASSLESS</b> <b>QDISCS</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  absence  of classful qdiscs, classless qdiscs can only be attached at the root of a device. Full
       syntax:

       <b>tc</b> <b>qdisc</b> <b>add</b> <b>dev</b> <u>DEV</u> <b>root</b> QDISC QDISC-PARAMETERS

       To remove, issue

       <b>tc</b> <b>qdisc</b> <b>del</b> <b>dev</b> <u>DEV</u> <b>root</b>

       The <b>pfifo_fast</b> qdisc is the automatic default in the absence of a configured qdisc.

</pre><h4><b>CLASSFUL</b> <b>QDISCS</b></h4><pre>
       The classful qdiscs are:

       ATM    Map flows to virtual circuits of an underlying asynchronous transfer mode device.

       DRR    The Deficit Round Robin Scheduler is a more flexible replacement for Stochastic Fairness  Queuing.
              Unlike  SFQ,  there  are  no built-in queues -- you need to add classes and then set up filters to
              classify packets accordingly.  This can be  useful  e.g.  for  using  RED  qdiscs  with  different
              settings for particular traffic. There is no default class -- if a packet cannot be classified, it
              is dropped.

       ETS    The  ETS  qdisc  is  a  queuing discipline that merges functionality of PRIO and DRR qdiscs in one
              scheduler. ETS makes it easy to configure a set of strict and bandwidth-sharing bands to implement
              the transmission selection described in 802.1Qaz.

       HFSC   Hierarchical Fair Service Curve guarantees precise bandwidth and delay allocation for leaf classes
              and allocates excess bandwidth fairly. Unlike HTB, it makes use of packet dropping to achieve  low
              delays which interactive sessions benefit from.

       HTB    The  Hierarchy Token Bucket implements a rich linksharing hierarchy of classes with an emphasis on
              conforming to existing practices. HTB facilitates guaranteeing bandwidth to  classes,  while  also
              allowing specification of upper limits to inter-class sharing. It contains shaping elements, based
              on TBF and can prioritize classes.

       PRIO   The  PRIO qdisc is a non-shaping container for a configurable number of classes which are dequeued
              in order. This allows for easy prioritization of traffic, where lower classes  are  only  able  to
              send  if  higher ones have no packets available. To facilitate configuration, Type Of Service bits
              are honored by default.

       QFQ    Quick Fair Queueing is an <a href="../man1/O.1.html">O</a>(1) scheduler that provides near-optimal guarantees, and is  the  first
              to achieve that goal with a constant cost also with respect to the number of groups and the packet
              length. The QFQ algorithm has no loops, and uses very simple instructions and data structures that
              lend themselves very well to a hardware implementation.

</pre><h4><b>THEORY</b> <b>OF</b> <b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       Classes  form  a  tree,  where  each class has a single parent.  A class may have multiple children. Some
       qdiscs allow for runtime addition of classes (HTB) while others (PRIO) are created with a  static  number
       of children.

       Qdiscs  which  allow dynamic addition of classes can have zero or more subclasses to which traffic may be
       enqueued.

       Furthermore, each class contains a <b>leaf</b> <b>qdisc</b> which by default  has  <b>pfifo</b>  behaviour,  although  another
       qdisc  can  be  attached in place. This qdisc may again contain classes, but each class can have only one
       leaf qdisc.

       When a packet enters a classful qdisc it can be <b>classified</b> to one of the classes within.  Three  criteria
       are available, although not all qdiscs will use all three:

       tc filters
              If tc filters are attached to a class, they are consulted first for relevant instructions. Filters
              can match on all fields of a packet header, as well as on the firewall mark applied by iptables.

       Type of Service
              Some qdiscs have built in rules for classifying packets based on the TOS field.

       skb-&gt;priority
              Userspace  programs  can  encode  a  <u>class-id</u>  in  the 'skb-&gt;priority' field using the SO_PRIORITY
              option.

       Each node within the tree can have its own filters but higher level filters may also  point  directly  to
       lower classes.

       If  classification  did not succeed, packets are enqueued to the leaf qdisc attached to that class. Check
       qdisc specific manpages for details, however.

</pre><h4><b>NAMING</b></h4><pre>
       All qdiscs, classes and filters have IDs, which can either be specified or be automatically assigned.

       IDs consist of a <b>major</b> number and a <b>minor</b> number, separated by a colon -  <b>major</b>:<b>minor</b>.   Both  <b>major</b>  and
       <b>minor</b> are hexadecimal numbers and are limited to 16 bits. There are two special values: root is signified
       by <b>major</b> and <b>minor</b> of all ones, and unspecified is all zeros.

       QDISCS A  qdisc,  which  potentially  can have children, gets assigned a <b>major</b> number, called a 'handle',
              leaving the <b>minor</b> number namespace available for classes. The handle is expressed as '10:'.  It is
              customary to explicitly assign a handle to qdiscs expected to have children.

       CLASSES
              Classes residing under a qdisc share their qdisc <b>major</b> number, but  each  have  a  separate  <b>minor</b>
              number  called  a  'classid'  that  has  no relation to their parent classes, only to their parent
              qdisc. The same naming custom as for qdiscs applies.

       FILTERS
              Filters have a three part ID, which is only needed when using a hashed filter hierarchy.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The following parameters are widely used in TC. For other parameters, see the man  pages  for  individual
       qdiscs.

       RATES  Bandwidths or rates.  These parameters accept a floating point number, possibly followed by either
              a  unit  (both  SI and IEC units supported), or a float followed by a '%' character to specify the
              rate as a percentage of the device's speed (e.g. 5%, 99.5%). Warning: specifying  the  rate  as  a
              percentage  means  a  fraction  of  the current speed; if the speed changes, the value will not be
              recalculated.

              bit or a bare number
                     Bits per second

              kbit   Kilobits per second

              mbit   Megabits per second

              gbit   Gigabits per second

              tbit   Terabits per second

              bps    Bytes per second

              kbps   Kilobytes per second

              mbps   Megabytes per second

              gbps   Gigabytes per second

              tbps   Terabytes per second

              To specify in IEC units, replace the SI prefix (k-, m-, g-, t-) with IEC prefix (ki-, mi-, gi- and
              ti-) respectively.

              TC store rates as a 32-bit unsigned integer in bps internally, so we can specify  a  max  rate  of
              4294967295 bps.

       TIMES  Length of time. Can be specified as a floating point number followed by an optional unit:

              s, sec or secs
                     Whole seconds

              ms, msec or msecs
                     Milliseconds

              us, usec, usecs or a bare number
                     Microseconds.

              TC  defined  its  own  time  unit (equal to microsecond) and stores time values as 32-bit unsigned
              integer, thus we can specify a max time value of 4294967295 usecs.

       SIZES  Amounts of data. Can be specified as a floating point number followed by an optional unit:

              b or a bare number

              TC stores sizes internally as 32-bit unsigned integer in byte, so we can specify  a  max  size  of
              4294967295 bytes.

       VALUES Other  values without a unit.  These parameters are interpreted as decimal by default, but you can
              indicate TC to  interpret  them  as  octal  and  hexadecimal  by  adding  a  '0'  or  '0x'  prefix
              respectively.

</pre><h4><b>TC</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following commands are available for qdiscs, classes and filter:

       add    Add  a  qdisc,  class  or  filter  to a node. For all entities, a <b>parent</b> must be passed, either by
              passing its ID or by attaching directly to the root of a device.   When  creating  a  qdisc  or  a
              filter, it can be named with the <b>handle</b> parameter. A class is named with the <b>classid</b> parameter.

       delete A  qdisc  can  be  deleted  by specifying its handle, which may also be 'root'. All subclasses and
              their leaf qdiscs are automatically deleted, as well as any filters attached to them.

       change Some entities can be modified 'in place'. Shares the syntax of 'add', with the exception that  the
              handle cannot be changed and neither can the parent. In other words, <b>change</b> cannot move a node.

       replace
              Performs  a  nearly atomic remove/add on an existing node id. If the node does not exist yet it is
              created.

       get    Displays a single filter given the interface <u>DEV</u>, <u>qdisc-id</u>, <u>priority</u>, <u>protocol</u> and <u>filter-id</u>.

       show   Displays all filters attached to the given interface. A valid parent ID must be passed.

       link   Only available for qdiscs and performs a replace where the node must exist already.

</pre><h4><b>MONITOR</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>tc</b> utility can monitor events generated by the kernel such  as  adding/deleting  qdiscs,  filters  or
       actions, or modifying existing ones.

       The following command is available for <b>monitor</b> :

       <b>file</b>   If the file option is given, the <b>tc</b> does not listen to kernel events, but opens the given file and
              dumps its contents. The file has to be in binary format and contain netlink messages.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b>, <b>-b</b> <b>filename</b>, <b>-batch</b>, <b>-batch</b> <b>filename</b>
              read  commands  from  provided  file  or standard input and invoke them.  First failure will cause
              termination of tc.

       <b>-force</b> don't terminate tc on errors in batch mode.  If there were any  errors  during  execution  of  the
              commands, the application return code will be non zero.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>-oneline</b>
              output  each  record  on  a  single  line,  replacing  line  feeds with the <b>'\'</b> character. This is
              convenient when you want to count records with <b><a href="../man1/wc.1.html">wc</a></b>(1) or to <b><a href="../man1/grep.1.html">grep</a></b>(1) the output.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>-net</b>, <b>-netns</b> &lt;NETNS&gt;
              switches <b>tc</b> to the specified network namespace <u>NETNS</u>.  Actually it just simplifies executing of:

              <b>ip</b> <b>netns</b> <b>exec</b> <u>NETNS</u> <b>tc</b> [ <u>OPTIONS</u> ] <u>OBJECT</u> { <u>COMMAND</u> | <b>help</b> }

              to

              <b>tc</b> -n[etns] <u>NETNS</u> [ <u>OPTIONS</u> ] <u>OBJECT</u> { <u>COMMAND</u> | <b>help</b> }

       <b>-N</b>, <b>-Numeric</b>
              Print the number of protocol, scope, dsfield, etc directly  instead  of  converting  it  to  human
              readable name.

       <b>-cf</b>, <b>-conf</b> &lt;FILENAME&gt;
              specifies  path  to  the  config file. This option is used in conjunction with other options (e.g.
              <b>-nm</b>).

       <b>-t</b>, <b>-timestamp</b>
              When <b>tc</b> <b>monitor</b> runs, print timestamp before the event message in format:
                 Timestamp: &lt;Day&gt; &lt;Month&gt; &lt;DD&gt; &lt;hh:mm:ss&gt; &lt;YYYY&gt; &lt;usecs&gt; usec

       <b>-ts</b>, <b>-tshort</b>
              When <b>tc</b> <b>monitor</b> runs, prints short timestamp before the event message in format:
                 [&lt;YYYY&gt;-&lt;MM&gt;-&lt;DD&gt;T&lt;hh:mm:ss&gt;.&lt;ms&gt;]

       <b>-echo</b>  Request the kernel to send the applied configuration back.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The show command has additional formatting options:

       <b>-s</b>, <b>-stats</b>, <b>-statistics</b>
              output more statistics about packet usage.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>-details</b>
              output more detailed information about rates and cell sizes.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>-raw</b>
              output raw hex values for handles.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>-pretty</b>
              for u32 filter, decode offset and mask values to equivalent filter commands based on  TCP/IP.   In
              JSON output, add whitespace to improve readability.

       <b>-iec</b>   print rates in IEC units (ie. 1K = 1024).

       <b>-g</b>, <b>-graph</b>
              shows  classes  as  ASCII  graph.  Prints  generic  stats  info  under each class if <b>-s</b> option was
              specified. Classes can be filtered only by <b>dev</b> option.

       <b>-c</b>[<b>color</b>][<b>=</b>{<b>always</b>|<b>auto</b>|<b>never</b>}
              Configure color output. If parameter is omitted or <b>always</b>, color output is enabled  regardless  of
              stdout  state.  If  parameter  is  <b>auto</b>,  stdout is checked to be a terminal before enabling color
              output. If parameter is <b>never</b>, color output is disabled. If specified multiple times, the last one
              takes precedence. This flag is ignored if <b>-json</b> is also given.

       <b>-j</b>, <b>-json</b>
              Display results in JSON format.

       <b>-nm</b>, <b>-name</b>
              resolve class name from <b>/etc/iproute2/tc_cls</b> file or from file specified by <b>-cf</b> option. This  file
              is just a mapping of <b>classid</b> to class name:

                 # Here is comment
                 1:40   voip # Here is another comment
                 1:50   web
                 1:60   ftp
                 1:2    home

              <b>tc</b>  will  not  fail if <b>-nm</b> was specified without <b>-cf</b> option but <b>/etc/iproute2/tc_cls</b> file does not
              exist, which makes it possible to pass <b>-nm</b> option for creating <b>tc</b> alias.

       <b>-br</b>, <b>-brief</b>
              Print only essential data needed to identify the filter and  action  (handle,  cookie,  etc.)  and
              stats. This option is currently only supported by <b>tc</b> <b>filter</b> <b>show</b> and <b>tc</b> <b>actions</b> <b>ls</b> commands.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       tc -g class show dev eth0
           Shows classes as ASCII graph on eth0 interface.

       tc -g -s class show dev eth0
           Shows classes as ASCII graph with stats info under each class.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tc</b> was written by Alexey N. Kuznetsov and added in Linux 2.2.
