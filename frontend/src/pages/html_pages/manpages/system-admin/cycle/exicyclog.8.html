</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       exicyclog - Cycle exim's logfiles

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>eximcyclog</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>exicyclog</b> script can be used to cycle (rotate) <u>mainlog</u> and <u>rejectlog</u> files.  This is not necessary if
       only  syslog  is  being used.  Some operating systems have their own standard mechanisms for log cycling,
       and these can be used instead of <b>exicyclog</b> if preferred.

       Each time <b>exicyclog</b> is run the file names get ‘shuffled down’ by one.  If  the  main  log  file  name  is
       mainlog  (the  default)  then  when  <b>exicyclog</b> is run mainlog becomes mainlog.01, the previous mainlog.01
       becomes mainlog.02 and so on, up to a limit which is set in the script, and which defaults to 10.  Reject
       logs are handled similarly.

       If no mainlog file exists, the script does nothing.  Files that ‘drop off’  the  end  are  deleted.   All
       files with numbers greater than 01 are compressed, using a compression command which is configured by the
       COMPRESS_COMMAND  setting  in Local/Makefile.  It is usual to run “exicyclog” daily from a root “crontab”
       entry of the form

         1 0 * * * su exim -c /usr/exim/bin/exicyclog

       assuming you have used the name ‘exim’ for the Exim user.  You can run <b>exicyclog</b> as root if you wish, but
       there is no need.

       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff than us and has more experience in
       writing manual pages, any patches would be greatly appreciated.
