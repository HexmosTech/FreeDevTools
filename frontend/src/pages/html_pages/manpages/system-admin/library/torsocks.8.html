</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       torsocks  —  Library  for  intercepting outgoing network connections and redirecting them through the Tor
       SOCKS proxy.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Torsocks library overloads the libc symbols use for Internet  communication  such  as  <b><a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</a>(2)</b>  system
       call. Using that technique, the library sends everything through the Tor network including DNS resolution
       done by the application.

       For  DNS, <b><a href="../man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname</a>(3)</b> family functions are rerouted through Tor.  Please note that the ISC res_* API
       is currently not supported.

       Here is an example on how to use torsocks library with <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a>(1)</b>:

       $ LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libtorsocks.so ssh -l kalexander -p 1234 prism.nsa.gov [...]

</pre><h4><b>SHELL</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Set LD_PRELOAD to load the library then use applications as normal. The syntax to force  preload  of  the
       library for different shells is specified below:

       Bash, Ksh and Bourne shell:

       $ export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libtorsocks.so

       C Shell:

       $ setenv LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libtorsocks.so

       This  process  can  be  automated (for Bash, Bourne and Korn shell users) for a single command or for all
       commands in a shell session by using the <b><a href="../man1/torsocks.1.html">torsocks</a>(1)</b> script.

       You can also setup <b><a href="../man1/torsocks.1.html">torsocks</a>(1)</b> in such a way that all processes  automatically  use  it,  a  very  useful
       configuration. Please refer to the torsocks script documentation for more information.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       TORSOCKS_CONF_FILE
              This  environment variable overrides the default location of the torsocks configuration file. This
              variable is not honored if the program torsocks is embedded in is setuid.

       TORSOCKS_LOG_LEVEL
              Enable logging level of torsocks library. By default, warnings and errors are printed  (level  3).
              Note  that  each  level  includes the lower ones except the 1 which disables any possible logging.
              (default: 3)

              1   No log at all.
              2   Error messages.
              3   Warning messages.
              4   Notice messages.
              5   Debug messages.

       TORSOCKS_LOG_TIME
              Control whether or not the time is added to each logging line. (default: 1)

       TORSOCKS_LOG_FILE_PATH
              If set, torsocks will log in the file set by this variable. (default: stderr)

       TORSOCKS_USERNAME
              Set the username for the SOCKS5 authentication method. Password MUST be set also with the variable
              below.

       TORSOCKS_PASSWORD
              Set the password for the SOCKS5 authentication method. Username MUST be set also with the variable
              above.

       TORSOCKS_TOR_ADDRESS
              Set the Tor IP address. Hostnames are not supported here. (default: 127.0.0.1)

       TORSOCKS_TOR_PORT
              Set the Tor port. (default: 9050)

       TORSOCKS_ALLOW_INBOUND
              Allow inbound connections so the application can accept and listen for connections.

       TORSOCKS_ISOLATE_PID
              Set the username and password for the SOCKS5 authentication method to  a  PID/current  time  based
              value automatically. Username and Password MUST NOT be set.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>DNS</b>
       Torsocks  is not able to send DNS queries through Tor since UDP is not supported. Thus, any UDP socket is
       denied. However, DNS queries that can be intercept are sent to Tor and sent back to the caller.

   <b>ERRORS</b>
       Torsocks might generate error messages and print  them  to  stderr  when  there  are  problems  with  the
       configuration  file  or  the  SOCKS  negotiation  with the Tor daemon. The TORSOCKS_LOG_LEVEL environment
       variable controls that behavior as well as the log file option. Keep in mind that this library can output
       on the stderr of the application.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Outgoing TCP connections can only be proxified through the Tor network.

       Torsocks forces the libc resolver to use TCP for name queries, if it does this it does it  regardless  of
       whether  or  not the DNS to be queried is local or not.  This introduces overhead and should only be used
       when needed.

       Torsocks uses ELF dynamic loader features to intercept dynamic function calls from programs in  which  it
       is  embedded.  As  a result, non-ELF executables, or executables that make system calls directly with the
       system call trap (int 0x80) are not supported.
