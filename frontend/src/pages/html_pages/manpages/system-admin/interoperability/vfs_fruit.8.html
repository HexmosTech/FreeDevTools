       vfs_fruit - Enhanced OS X and Netatalk interoperability

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       vfs objects = fruit

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This VFS module is part of the <b><a href="../man7/samba.7.html">samba</a></b>(7) suite.

       The vfs_fruit module provides enhanced compatibility with Apple SMB clients and interoperability with a
       Netatalk 3 AFP fileserver.

       The module should be stacked with vfs_catia if enabling character conversion and must be stacked with
       vfs_streams_xattr, see the example section for the correct config.

       The module enables alternate data streams (ADS) support for a share, intercepts the OS X special streams
       "AFP_AfpInfo" and "AFP_Resource" and handles them in a special way. All other named streams are deferred
       to vfs_streams_xattr which must be loaded together with vfs_fruit.

       Be careful when mixing shares with and without vfs_fruit. OS X clients negotiate SMB2 AAPL protocol
       extensions on the first tcon, so mixing shares with and without fruit will globally disable AAPL if the
       first tcon is without fruit.

       Having shares with ADS support enabled for OS X client is worthwhile because it resembles the behaviour
       of Apple's own SMB server implementation and it avoids certain severe performance degradations caused by
       Samba's case sensitivity semantics.

       The OS X metadata and resource fork stream can be stored in a way compatible with Netatalk 3 by setting
       fruit:resource = file and fruit:metadata = netatalk.

       OS X maps NTFS illegal characters to the Unicode private range in SMB requests. By setting fruit:encoding
       = native, all mapped characters are converted to native ASCII characters.

       Finally, share access modes are optionally checked against Netatalk AFP sharing modes by setting
       fruit:locking = netatalk.

       This module is not stackable other than described in this manpage.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options must be set in the global smb.conf section and won't take effect when set per
       share.

       fruit:aapl = yes | no
           A <u>global</u> option whether to enable Apple's SMB2+ extension codenamed AAPL. Default <u>yes</u>. This extension
           enhances several deficiencies when connecting from Macs:

                  •   directory enumeration is enriched with Mac relevant filesystem metadata (UNIX mode,
                      FinderInfo, resource fork size and effective permission), as a result the Mac client
                      doesn't need to fetch this metadata individually per directory entry resulting in an often
                      tremendous performance increase.

                  •   The ability to query and modify the UNIX mode of directory entries.

           There's a set of per share options that come into play when <u>fruit:aapl</u> is enabled. These options,
           listed below, can be used to disable the computation of specific Mac metadata in the directory
           enumeration context, all are enabled by default:

                  •   readdir_attr:aapl_rsize = yes | no

                  •   readdir_attr:aapl_finder_info = yes | no

                  •   readdir_attr:aapl_max_access = yes | no

           See below for a description of these options.

       fruit:nfs_aces = yes | no
           A <u>global</u> option whether support for querying and modifying the UNIX mode of directory entries via NFS
           ACEs is enabled, default <u>yes</u>.

       fruit:copyfile = yes | no
           A <u>global</u> option whether to enable OS X specific copychunk ioctl that requests a copy of a whole file
           along with all attached metadata.

           WARNING: the copyfile request is blocking the client while the server does the copy.

           The default is <u>no</u>.

       fruit:model = MacSamba
           This option defines the model string inside the AAPL extension and will determine the appearance of
           the icon representing the Samba server in the Finder window.

           The default is <u>MacSamba</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options can be set either in the global smb.conf section or per share.

       fruit:resource = [ file | xattr | stream ]
           Controls where the OS X resource fork is stored.

           Due to a spelling bug in all Samba versions older than 4.6.0, this option can also be given as
           <u>fruit:ressource</u>, ie with two s.

           Settings:

                  •   file (default) - use a ._ AppleDouble file compatible with OS X and Netatalk

                  •   xattr - use a xattr, requires a filesystem with large xattr support and a file IO API
                      compatible with xattrs, this boils down to Solaris and derived platforms and ZFS

                  •   stream (experimental) - pass the stream on to the next module in the VFS stack.  <u>Warning:</u>
                      this option should not be used with the <u>streams_xattr</u> module due to the extended
                      attributes size limitations of most filesystems.

       fruit:time machine = [ yes | no ]
           Controls if Time Machine support via the FULLSYNC volume capability is advertised to clients.

                  •   yes - Enables Time Machine support for this share. Also registers the share with mDNS in
                      case Samba is built with mDNS support.

                  •   no (default) Disables advertising Time Machine support.

           This option enforces the following settings per share (or for all shares if enabled globally):

                  •   durable handles = yes

                  •   kernel oplocks = no

                  •   kernel share modes = no

                  •   posix locking = no

       fruit:time machine max size = SIZE [K|M|G|T|P]
           Useful for Time Machine: limits the reported disksize, thus preventing Time Machine from using the
           whole real disk space for backup. The option takes a number plus an optional unit.

           <u>IMPORTANT</u>: This is an approximated calculation that only takes into account the contents of Time
           Machine sparsebundle images. Therefore you <u>MUST</u> <u>NOT</u> use this volume to store other content when using
           this option, because it would NOT be accounted.

           The calculation works by reading the band size from the Info.plist XML file of the sparsebundle,
           reading the bands/ directory counting the number of band files, and then multiplying one with the
           other.

       fruit:metadata = [ stream | netatalk ]
           Controls where the OS X metadata stream is stored:

                  •   netatalk (default) - use Netatalk compatible xattr

                  •   stream - pass the stream on to the next module in the VFS stack

       fruit:locking = [ netatalk | none ]

                  •   none (default) - no cross protocol locking

                  •   netatalk - use cross protocol locking with Netatalk

       fruit:encoding = [ native | private ]
           Controls how the set of illegal NTFS ASCII character, commonly used by OS X clients, are stored in
           the filesystem.

           <u>Important:</u> this is known to not fully work with <u>fruit:metadata=stream</u> or <u>fruit:resource=stream</u>.

                  •   private (default) - store characters as encoded by the OS X client: mapped to the Unicode
                      private range

                  •   native - store characters with their native ASCII value.  <u>Important</u>: this option requires
                      the use of <u>vfs_catia</u> in the VFS module stack as shown in the examples section.

       fruit:veto_appledouble = yes | no
           <u>Note:</u> this option only applies when <u>fruit:resource</u> is set to <u>file</u> (the default).

           When <u>fruit:resource</u> is set to <u>file</u>, vfs_fruit may create ._ AppleDouble files. This options controls
           whether these ._ AppleDouble files are vetoed which prevents the client from accessing them.

           Vetoing ._ files may break some applications, e.g. extracting Mac ZIP archives from Mac clients
           fails, because they contain ._ files.  rsync will also be unable to sync files beginning with
           underscores, as the temporary files it uses for these will start with ._ and so cannot be created.

           Setting this option to false will fix this, but the abstraction leak of exposing the internally
           created ._ files may have other unknown side effects.

           The default is <u>yes</u>.

       readdir_attr:aapl_rsize = yes | no
           Return resource fork size in SMB2 FIND responses.

           The default is <u>yes</u>.

       readdir_attr:aapl_finder_info = yes | no
           Return FinderInfo in SMB2 FIND responses.

           The default is <u>yes</u>.

       readdir_attr:aapl_max_access = yes | no
           Return the user's effective maximum permissions in SMB2 FIND responses. This is an expensive
           computation, setting this to off pretends the use has maximum effective permissions.

           The default is <u>yes</u>.

       fruit:wipe_intentionally_left_blank_rfork = yes | no
           Whether to wipe Resource Fork data that matches the special 286 bytes sized placeholder blob that
           macOS client create on occasion. The blob contains a string “This resource fork intentionally left
           blank”, the remaining bytes being mostly zero. There being no one use of this data, it is probably
           safe to discard it. When this option is enabled, this module truncates the Resource Fork stream to 0
           bytes.

           The default is <u>no</u>.

       fruit:delete_empty_adfiles = yes | no
           Whether to delete empty AppleDouble files. Empty means that the resource fork entry in the
           AppleDouble files is of size 0, or the size is exactly 286 bytes and the content matches a special
           boilerplate resource fork created my macOS.

           The default is <u>no</u>.

       fruit:zero_file_id = yes | no
           Whether to return zero to queries of on-disk file identifier if the client has negotiated AAPL.

           Mac applications and / or the Mac SMB client code expect the on-disk file identifier to have the
           semantics of HFS+ Catalog Node Identifier (CNID). Samba provides File-IDs based on a file's inode
           number which gets recycled across file creation and deletion and can therefore not be used for Mac
           client. Returning a file identifier of zero causes the Mac client to stop using and trusting the file
           id returned from the server.

           The default is <u>yes</u>.

       fruit:convert_adouble = yes | no
           Whether an attempt shall be made to convert ._ AppleDouble sidecar files to native streams (xattrs
           when using vfs_streams_xattr). The main use case for this conversion is transparent migration from a
           server config without streams support where the macOS client created those AppleDouble sidecar files.

           The default is <u>yes</u>.

       fruit:validate_afpinfo = yes | no
           Apple clients use the AFP_AfpInfo stream to store structured file metadata. As part of the marshaled
           data stored in the stream the first eight bytes contain some header information. Apple's SMB server
           as well as Samba will validate this header bytes processing a client write request on this stream,
           and, if the validation fails, fail the write. While this validation is generally correct, in some
           data migration scenarios clients may try to migrate data from 3rd-party SMB servers to Samba servers
           where the header information is broken for whatever reason. To allow migration and header fix-up in
           these scenarios, the validation can be temporarily disabled by setting this option to <u>no</u>.

           The default is <u>yes</u>.
