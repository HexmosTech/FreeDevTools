       tc-stab - Generic size table manipulations

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       tc qdisc add ... stab
           [ <b>mtu</b> BYTES ] [ <b>tsize</b> SLOTS ]
           [ <b>mpu</b> BYTES ] [ <b>overhead</b> BYTES ]
           [ <b>linklayer</b> { adsl | atm | ethernet } ] ...

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       For the description of BYTES - please refer to the <b>UNITS</b> section of <b><a href="../man8/tc.8.html">tc</a></b>(8).

       <b>mtu</b>
           maximum packet size we create size table for, assumed 2048 if not specified explicitly

       <b>tsize</b>
           required table size, assumed 512 if not specified explicitly

       <b>mpu</b>
           minimum packet size used in computations

       <b>overhead</b>
           per-packet size overhead (can be negative) used in computations

       <b>linklayer</b>
           required linklayer specification.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Size  tables allow manipulation of packet sizes, as seen by the whole scheduler framework (of course, the
       actual packet size remains the same). Adjusted packet size  is  calculated  only  once  -  when  a  qdisc
       enqueues the packet. Initial root enqueue initializes it to the real packet's size.

       Each  qdisc  can  use  a different size table, but the adjusted size is stored in an area shared by whole
       qdisc hierarchy attached to the interface. The effect is that if you have such a setup,  the  last  qdisc
       with  a  stab in a chain "wins". For example, consider HFSC with simple pfifo attached to one of its leaf
       classes.  If that pfifo qdisc has stab  defined,  it  will  override  lengths  calculated  during  HFSC's
       enqueue;  and in turn, whenever HFSC tries to dequeue a packet, it will use a potentially invalid size in
       its calculations. Normal setups will usually include  stab  defined  only  on  root  qdisc,  but  further
       overriding gives extra flexibility for less usual setups.

       The  initial  size table is calculated by <b>tc</b> tool using <b>mtu</b> and <b>tsize</b> parameters. The algorithm sets each
       slot's size to the smallest power of 2 value, so the whole <b>mtu</b> is covered  by  the  size  table.  Neither
       <b>tsize</b>,  nor <b>mtu</b> have to be power of 2 value, so the size table will usually support more than is required
       by <b>mtu</b>.

       For example, with <b>mtu</b> = 1500 and <b>tsize</b> = 128, a table with 128 slots will be created, where slot  0  will
       correspond  to  sizes  0-16, slot 1 to 17 - 32, ..., slot 127 to 2033 - 2048. Sizes assigned to each slot
       depend on <b>linklayer</b> parameter.

       Stab calculation is also safe for an unusual case, when a size assigned to a slot would  be  larger  than
       2^16-1 (you will lose the accuracy though).

       During  the kernel part of packet size adjustment, <b>overhead</b> will be added to original size, and then slot
       will be calculated. If the size would cause overflow, more than 1 slot will be  used  to  get  the  final
       size. This of course will affect accuracy, but it's only a guard against unusual situations.

       Currently there are two methods of creating values stored in the size table - ethernet and atm (adsl):

       ethernet
           This  is  basically  1-1 mapping, so following our example from above (disregarding <b>mpu</b> for a moment)
           slot 0 would have 8, slot 1 would have 16 and so on, up to slot 127 with 2048. Note,  that  <b>mpu</b>  &gt;  0
           must  be  specified, and slots that would get less than specified by <b>mpu</b> will get <b>mpu</b> instead. If you
           don't specify <b>mpu</b>, the size table will not be created at  all  (it  wouldn't  make  any  difference),
           although any <b>overhead</b> value will be respected during calculations.

       atm, adsl
           ATM  linklayer  consists of 53 byte cells, where each of them provides 48 bytes for payload. Also all
           the cells must be fully utilized, thus the last one is padded if/as necessary.

           When the size table is calculated, adjusted size that fits properly into lowest amount  of  cells  is
           assigned to a slot. For example, a 100 byte long packet requires three 48-byte payloads, so the final
           size would require 3 ATM cells - 159 bytes.

           For  ATM  size tables, 16 bytes sized slots are perfectly enough. The default values of <b>mtu</b> and <b>tsize</b>
           create 4 bytes sized slots.

</pre><h4><b>TYPICAL</b> <b>OVERHEADS</b></h4><pre>
       The following values are typical for different adsl scenarios (based on <b>[1]</b> and <b>[2]</b>):

       LLC based:
           PPPoA - 14 (PPP - 2, ATM - 12)
           PPPoE - 40+ (PPPoE - 8, ATM - 18, ethernet 14, possibly FCS - 4+padding)
           Bridged - 32 (ATM - 18, ethernet 14, possibly FCS - 4+padding)
           IPoA - 16 (ATM - 16)

       VC Mux based:
           PPPoA - 10 (PPP - 2, ATM - 8)
           PPPoE - 32+ (PPPoE - 8, ATM - 10, ethernet 14, possibly FCS - 4+padding)
           Bridged - 24+ (ATM - 10, ethernet 14, possibly FCS - 4+padding)
           IPoA - 8 (ATM - 8)
       There are a few important things regarding the above overheads:

       •   IPoA in LLC case requires SNAP, instead of LLC-NLPID (see rfc2684)  -  this  is  the  reason  why  it
           actually takes more space than PPPoA.

       •   In  rare cases, FCS might be preserved on protocols that include Ethernet frames (Bridged and PPPoE).
           In such situation, any Ethernet specific padding guaranteeing 64 bytes long  frame  size  has  to  be
           included as well (see RFC2684).  In the other words, it also guarantees that any packet you send will
           take minimum 2 atm cells. You should set <b>mpu</b> accordingly for that.

       •   When the size table is consulted, and you're shaping traffic for the sake of another modem/router, an
           Ethernet  header  (without  padding)  will  already  be  added to initial packet's length. You should
           compensate for that by subtracting 14 from the above  overheads  in  this  case.  If  you're  shaping
           directly on the router (for example, with speedtouch usb modem) using ppp daemon, you're using raw ip
           interface without underlying layer2, so nothing will be added.

</pre><h4><b>ETHERNET</b> <b>CARDS</b> <b>CONSIDERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       It's  often  forgotten  that  modern network cards (even cheap ones on desktop motherboards) and/or their
       drivers often support different offloading mechanisms. In the context of traffic shaping, 'tso' and 'gso'
       might cause undesirable effects, due to massive TCP segments  being  considered  during  traffic  shaping
       (including  stab  calculations).  For  slow  uplink  interfaces,  it's  good  to  use <b>ethtool</b> to turn off
       offloading features.
