       ec2-metadata - Retrieve instance metadata from within a running EC2 instance

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ec2-metadata</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ec2-metadata</b>  program  is  a  utility  to  retrieve  EC2 instance metadata from within a running EC2
       instance.

       Instance metadata is data about your instance that you  can  use  to  configure  or  manage  the  running
       instance.  Instance  metadata  is  divided  into categories, for example, host name, events, and security
       groups.

       You can also use instance metadata to access user data that you specified when launching  your  instance.
       For  example,  you  can specify parameters for configuring your instance, or include a simple script. You
       can build generic AMIs and use user data to modify the configuration files supplied at launch  time.  For
       example,  if  you run web servers for various small businesses, they can all use the same generic AMI and
       retrieve their content from the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify in the user data at launch.  To  add  a
       new  customer  at any time, create a bucket for the customer, add their content, and launch your AMI with
       the unique bucket name provided to your code in the user data. If you launch more than  one  instance  at
       the  same  time,  the  user data is available to all instances in that reservation. Each instance that is
       part of the same reservation has a unique ami-launch-index  number,  allowing  you  to  write  code  that
       controls  what  to  do.  For  example,  the  first host might elect itself as an initial master node in a
       cluster.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
