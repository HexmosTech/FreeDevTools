       sg_decode_sense - decode SCSI sense and related data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sg_decode_sense</b>   [<u>--binary=BFN</u>]   [<u>--cdb</u>]   [<u>--err=ES</u>]   [<u>--file=HFN</u>]   [<u>--help</u>]  [<u>--hex</u>]  [<u>--inhex=HFN</u>]
       [<u>--ignore-first</u>]  [<u>--json[=JO]</u>]  [<u>--js-file=JFN</u>]  [<u>--nodecode</u>]  [<u>--nospace</u>]   [<u>--status=SS</u>]   [<u>--verbose</u>]
       [<u>--version</u>] [<u>--write=WFN</u>] [H1 H2 H3 ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  utility takes SCSI sense data in binary or as a sequence of ASCII hexadecimal bytes and decodes it.
       The primary reference for the decoding is SPC-5 ANSI INCITS 502-2020 and  the  most  recent  draft  SPC-6
       revision 6 which can be found at https://www.t10.org and other locations on the internet.

       SCSI  sense  data  is  often  found in kernel log files as a result of something going wrong or may be an
       informative warning. It is often shown as a sequence of hexadecimal bytes, starting with 70, 71, 72,  73,
       f0  or  f1.   Sense  data could be up to 252 bytes long but typically is much shorter than that, 18 bytes
       long is often seen and is usually associated with the older "fixed" format sense data.

       The sense data can be provided on the command line or in a file. If given on the command line  the  sense
       data should be a sequence of hexadecimal bytes separated by space. Alternatively a file can be given with
       the  contents  in  binary or ASCII hexadecimal bytes. The latter form can contain several lines each with
       none, one or more ASCII hexadecimal bytes separated by space (comma or tab). The hash symbol  may  appear
       and it and the rest of the line is ignored making it useful for comments.

       If the <u>--cdb</u> option is given then rather than viewing the given hex arguments as sense data, it is viewed
       as  a  SCSI  command  descriptor  block (CDB). In this case the command name is printed out. That name is
       based on the first hex byte given (know as the  opcode)  and  optionally  on  another  field  called  the
       "service action".

       Another  alternate  action  is  when  the  <u>--err=ES</u>  is given. <u>ES</u> is assumed to be an "exit status" value
       between 0 and 255 from one of the utilities in this package.  A  descriptive  string  is  printed.  Other
       options are ignored apart from <u>--verbose</u>.

       When  the <u>--nodecode</u> option is given, this utility may be used to convert a binary file to hexadecimal or
       vice versa. The data converted does not need to be related to SCSI sense data nor CDBs.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--binary</b>=<u>BFN</u>
              the data is read in binary from a file called <u>BFN</u>. The option cannot be given with  <u>--file=HFN</u>  or
              <u>--inhex=HFN</u>  as  they  contradict. The data is assumed to be sense data unless the fI--nodecode is
              given.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--cdb</b>
              treat the given string of hex arguments as bytes in a SCSI CDB and decode the command name.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--err</b>=<u>ES</u>
              <u>ES</u> should be an "exit status" value between 0 and 255 that is available from the shell  (i.e.  the
              utility's execution context) after the utility is finished. By default an indicative error message
              is  printed  to stdout; and if the <u>--verbose</u> option is given once (or an odd number of times) then
              the message is instead printed to stderr. If <u>--verbose</u> is given two or more times a longer form of
              the message is output. In all cases the message is less than 128 characters long with one trailing
              line feed. All other command line options and arguments are ignored.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--file</b>=<u>HFN</u>
              the sense data is read in ASCII hexadecimal from a file called <u>HFN</u>.  The sense data should  appear
              as  a  sequence  of  bytes  separated by space, comma, tab, hyphen or newline. Everything from and
              including a hash symbol to the end of that line is ignored. If <u>--nospace</u> is set then no  separator
              is  required  between  the  ASCII hexadecimal digits in <u>HFN</u> with bytes decoded from pairs of ASCII
              hexadecimal digits.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              output the usage message then exit.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b>
              this option is used once in conjunction with <u>--write=WFN</u> in order to change the output written  to
              <u>WFN</u>  to  lines  of ASCII hex bytes suitable for a C language compiler. Each line contains up to 16
              bytes (e.g. a line starting with "0x3b,0x07,0x00,0xff").
              In other cases (i.e. when <u>--write=WFN</u> is not given, or this option is given more than  once)  then
              the output is as described in the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) manpage.
              The  combination  of  <u>--inhex=HFN</u>  and  this  option  used three times can be useful to converting
              hexadecimal bytes (e.g. hyphen separated) into a more regular form. The short option form is  more
              convenient for invoking this option three times (e.g. '-HHH').

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--inhex</b>=<u>HFN</u>
              same  action  as  <u>--file=HFN</u>. This option was added for compatibility with other utilities in this
              package that have a <u>--inhex=</u> option.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--ignore-first</b>
              many programs that output hex bytes (e.g. 'hexdump -C') have a running count  (or  index)  in  the
              first  column  of  each  line.  This option ignores the first hexadecimal value on each line. This
              option has no effect if <u>--binary=BFN</u> or <u>--nospace</u> are given. Blank lines and  any  character  from
              and after "#" on a line are ignored. Useful with the <u>--file=HFN</u> and <u>--nodecode</u> options.

       <b>-j</b>[=<u>JO</u>], <b>--json</b>[=<u>JO</u>]
              output  is  in  JSON  format instead of plain text form. Note that arguments to the short and long
              form are themselves optional and if present start with "=" and no whitespace is  permitted  around
              that "=".
              See sg3_utils_json manpage or use '?' for <u>JO</u> to get a summary.

       <b>-J</b>, <b>--js-file</b>=<u>JFN</u>
              output  is  in  JSON  format  and  it  is sent to a file named <u>JFN</u>. If that file exists then it is
              truncated. By default, the JSON output is sent to stdout.
              When this option is given,  the  <u>--json[=JO]</u>  option  is  implied  and  need  not  be  given.  The
              <u>--json[=JO]</u> option may still be needed to set the <u>JO</u> parameter to non-default values.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--nodecode</b>
              Do  not  decode  the  given data as sense or a cdb. Useful when arbitrary data is given (e.g. when
              converting hex to binary or vice versa).

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--nospace</b>
              expect ASCII hexadecimal to be a string of hexadecimal digits with no spaces between  them.  Bytes
              are  decoded  by taking two hexadecimal digits at a time, so an even number of digits is expected.
              The string of hexadecimal digits may be on the command line  (replacing  "H1  H2  H3")  or  spread
              across  multiple lines the <u>HFN</u> given to <u>--file=</u>.  On the command line, spaces (or other whitespace
              characters) between sequences of hexadecimal digits are ignored;  the  maximum  command  line  hex
              string is 1023 characters long.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--status</b>=<u>SS</u>
              where  <u>SS</u>  is  a SCSI status byte value, given in hexadecimal. The SCSI status byte is related to,
              but distinct from, sense data.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increase the degree of verbosity (debug messages).

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              output version string then exit.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--write</b>=<u>WFN</u>
              writes the sense data out to a file called <u>WFN</u>. If necessary <u>WFN</u> is created. If <u>WFN</u> exists then it
              is truncated prior to writing the sense data to it. If the <u>--hex</u> option is also given  then  ASCII
              hex is written to <u>WFN</u> (see the <u>--hex</u> option description); otherwise binary is written to <u>WFN</u>. This
              option  is  a convenience and may be helpful in converting the ASCII hexadecimal representation of
              sense data (or anything else) into the equivalent binary or a compilable ASCII hex form.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Unlike most utilities in this package, this utility does not access a SCSI device  (logical  unit).  This
       utility  accesses  a  library associated with this package. Amongst other things the library decodes SCSI
       sense data.

       The sg_raw utility takes a ASCII hexadecimal sequence representing a SCSI CDB. When sg_raw is  given  the
       '-vvv' option, it will attempt to decode the CDB name.

       Using the option combination: "<u>--inhex=HFN</u> <u>--nodecode</u> <u>--write=WFN</u>" may be used to convert hexadecimal (as
       produced by this and other utilities in this package) to binary where the output file is <u>WFN</u>.

       Unlike  many  other  utilities  there  is  no  <u>--raw</u>  option.  However binary data can be input using the
       <u>--binary=BFN</u> option while binary data can be output using the <u>--write=WFN</u> option (in the absence  of  the
       <u>--hex</u> option).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Sense  data  is  often printed out in kernel logs and sometimes on the command line when verbose or debug
       flags are given. It will be at least 8 bytes long, often 18 bytes long but may be longer.  A  sense  data
       string might look like this:

       f0 00 03 00 00 12 34 0a  00 00 00 00 11 00 00 00
       00 00

       Cut and paste it after the sg_decode_sense command:

         sg_decode_sense f0 00 03 00 00 12 34 0a 00 00 00 00 11 00 00 00 00 00

       and for this sense data the output should look like this:

        Fixed format, current;  Sense key: Medium Error
        Additional sense: Unrecovered read error
         Info fld=0x1234 [4660]

       For  a  medium  error the Info field is the logical block address (LBA) of the lowest numbered block that
       the associated SCSI command was not able to read (verify or write).

       To convert arbitrary binary data to hex,  suitable  to  be  parsed  by  other  sg3_utils  utilities.  The
       <u>--nodecode</u> option is used in this case:

         sg_decode_sense -N -i vpd_zbdc.hex -w vpd_zbdc.bin

       The '-HHH' will output hex to the console (stdout) in a form suitable for other utilities in this package
       to parse as input. And sg_decode_sense can also be used to convert from arbitrary hex to binary with:

         sg_decode_sense -N -b vpd_zbdc.raw -HHH

       Note  that  tools  like  hexdump and od place a counter (i.e. an index starting at 0) at the beginning of
       each line which is a pain when parsing hex.  The '/-HHH' option(s) does not output that  leading  counter
       on each line.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status of sg_decode_sense is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the <a href="../man8/sg3_utils.8.html">sg3_utils</a>(8) man page.
