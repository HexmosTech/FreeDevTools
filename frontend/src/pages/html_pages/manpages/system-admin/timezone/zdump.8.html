       zdump - timezone dumper

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>zdump</b> [ <u>option</u> ... ] [ <u>timezone</u> ... ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>zdump</b> program prints the current time in each <u>timezone</u> named on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --<b>version</b>
              Output version information and exit.

       --<b>help</b> Output short usage message and exit.

       -<b>i</b>     Output  a  description  of  time  intervals.   For  each  <u>timezone</u>  on the command line, output an
              interval-format description of the timezone.  See “INTERVAL FORMAT” below.

       -<b>v</b>     Output a verbose description of time intervals.  For each <u>timezone</u> on the command line, print  the
              times  at the two extreme time values, the times (if present) at and just beyond the boundaries of
              years that <b><a href="../man3/localtime.3.html">localtime</a></b>(3) and <b><a href="../man3/gmtime.3.html">gmtime</a></b>(3) can represent, and the times  both  one  second  before  and
              exactly  at  each  detected  time  discontinuity.   Each  line  is  followed by <b>isdst=</b><u>D</u> where <u>D</u> is
              positive, zero, or negative depending on whether the given time is daylight saving time,  standard
              time,  or an unknown time type, respectively.  Each line is also followed by <b>gmtoff=</b><u>N</u> if the given
              local time is known to be <u>N</u> seconds east of Greenwich.

       -<b>V</b>     Like -<b>v</b>, except omit output concerning extreme time and year values.  This generates  output  that
              is easier to compare to that of implementations with different time representations.

       -<b>c</b> [<u>loyear</u><b>,</b>]<u>hiyear</u>
              Cut  off  interval  output  at  the  given year(s).  Cutoff times are computed using the proleptic
              Gregorian calendar with year 0 and with Universal Time (UT) ignoring leap seconds.  Cutoffs are at
              the start of each year, where the lower-bound timestamp is inclusive and the upper  is  exclusive;
              for  example,  -<b>c</b>  <b>1970,2070</b>  selects  transitions  on or after 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC and before
              2070-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.  The default cutoff is -<b>500,2500</b>.

       -<b>t</b> [<u>lotime</u><b>,</b>]<u>hitime</u>
              Cut off interval output at the given time(s), given in decimal seconds since  1970-01-01  00:00:00
              Coordinated  Universal  Time  (UTC).   The  <u>timezone</u>  determines  whether  the count includes leap
              seconds.  As with -<b>c</b>, the cutoff's lower bound is inclusive and its upper bound is exclusive.

</pre><h4><b>INTERVAL</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The interval format is a compact text representation that is intended to  be  both  human-  and  machine-
       readable.   It  consists of an empty line, then a line “TZ=<u>string</u>” where <u>string</u> is a double-quoted string
       giving the timezone, a second line  “-  -  <u>interval</u>”  describing  the  time  interval  before  the  first
       transition  if  any,  and zero or more following lines “<u>date</u> <u>time</u> <u>interval</u>”, one line for each transition
       time and following interval.  Fields are separated by single tabs.

       Dates are in <u>yyyy</u>-<u>mm</u>-<u>dd</u> format and times are in 24-hour <u>hh</u>:<u>mm</u>:<u>ss</u> format where <u>hh</u>&lt;24.  Times are in  local
       time  immediately  after  the  transition.  A time interval description consists of a UT offset in signed
       ±<u>hhmmss</u> format, a time zone abbreviation, and an isdst flag.  An abbreviation that equals the  UT  offset
       is  omitted;  other abbreviations are double-quoted strings unless they consist of one or more alphabetic
       characters.  An isdst flag is omitted for standard time, and otherwise  is  a  decimal  integer  that  is
       unsigned and positive (typically 1) for daylight saving time and negative for unknown.

       In  times  and in UT offsets with absolute value less than 100 hours, the seconds are omitted if they are
       zero, and the minutes are also omitted if they are also zero.  Positive UT offsets are east of Greenwich.
       The UT offset -00 denotes a  UT  placeholder  in  areas  where  the  actual  offset  is  unspecified;  by
       convention,  this  occurs when the UT offset is zero and the time zone abbreviation begins with “-” or is
       “zzz”.

       In double-quoted strings, escape sequences represent unusual characters.  The escape sequences are \s for
       space, and \", \\, \f, \n, \r, \t, and \v with their usual meaning in the C programming language.   E.g.,
       the double-quoted string “"CET\s\"\\"” represents the character sequence “CET "\”.

       Here  is  an example of the output, with the leading empty line omitted.  (This example is shown with tab
       stops set far enough apart so that the tabbed columns line up.)

         TZ="Pacific/Honolulu"
         -           -         -103126  LMT
         1896-01-13  12:01:26  -1030    HST
         1933-04-30  03        -0930    HDT  1
         1933-05-21  11        -1030    HST
         1942-02-09  03        -0930    HWT  1
         1945-08-14  13:30     -0930    HPT  1
         1945-09-30  01        -1030    HST
         1947-06-08  02:30     -10      HST

       Here, local time begins 10 hours, 31 minutes  and  26  seconds  west  of  UT,  and  is  a  standard  time
       abbreviated  LMT.   Immediately  after  the  first  transition,  the  date  is 1896-01-13 and the time is
       12:01:26, and the following time interval is 10.5 hours west of UT,  a  standard  time  abbreviated  HST.
       Immediately  after  the  second  transition,  the  date  is  1933-04-30  and the time is 03:00:00 and the
       following time interval is 9.5 hours west of UT,  is  abbreviated  HDT,  and  is  daylight  saving  time.
       Immediately  after the last transition the date is 1947-06-08 and the time is 02:30:00, and the following
       time interval is 10 hours west of UT, a standard time abbreviated HST.

       Here are excerpts from another example:

         TZ="Europe/Astrakhan"
         -           -         +031212  LMT
         1924-04-30  23:47:48  +03
         1930-06-21  01        +04
         1981-04-01  01        +05           1
         1981-09-30  23        +04
         ...
         2014-10-26  01        +03
         2016-03-27  03        +04

       This time zone is east of UT, so its UT offsets are positive.  Also, many of its time zone  abbreviations
       are omitted since they duplicate the text of the UT offset.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Time discontinuities are found by sampling the results returned by <b><a href="../man3/localtime.3.html">localtime</a></b>(3) at twelve-hour intervals.
       This works in all real-world cases; one can construct artificial time zones for which this fails.

       In  the  -<b>v</b>  and  -<b>V</b>  output,  “UT”  denotes  the  value returned by <b><a href="../man3/gmtime.3.html">gmtime</a></b>(3), which uses UTC for modern
       timestamps and some other UT flavor for timestamps that predate the introduction of UTC.  No  attempt  is
       currently  made  to have the output use “UTC” for newer and “UT” for older timestamps, partly because the
       exact date of the introduction of UTC is problematic.
