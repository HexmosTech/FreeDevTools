</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       backup2l -  low-maintenance backup/restore tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>backup2l</b> [ <b>-c</b> <u>conffile</u> ] [ <b>-t</b> <u>backup-ID</u> ] <u>command</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>backup2l</b>  is  a  tool for generating, maintaining and restoring backups on a mountable file system (e. g.
       hard disk). The main design goals are low maintenance effort, efficiency,  transparency  and  robustness.
       It features differential backups at multiple hierarchical levels and provides rollback functionality.

       All  control  files  are  stored  together with the archives on the backup device, and their contents are
       mostly self-explaining. Hence, in the case of an emergency, a user does not only  have  to  rely  on  the
       restore  functionality  of  <b>backup2l</b>,  but  can  -  if  necessary - browse the files and extract archives
       manually.

       An open driver architecture allows one to use virtually any archiving program  as  a  backend.   Built-in
       drivers  support  <b>.tar.gz</b>,  <b>.tar.bz2</b>,  or  <b>.afioz</b>  files.  Further drivers can be added by the user. When
       restoring data, an appropriate driver is selected automatically for each archive depending on the  suffix
       of the archive file.

       The  method  of  hierarchical  differential  backups  is  a generalization to the concept of the "daily",
       "weekly" and "monthly" backups.  Each backup has a level and a serial number. Maximum-level  backups  are
       comparable  with daily differential backups, level-0 backups are full backups. For example, let <b>MAX_LEVEL</b>
       be 4 and <b>MAX_PER_LEVEL</b> be 5. After 5 level-4 backups (e. g. after 5 days), a new level-3 backup is  made.
       After 5 level-3 backups (and 5*5 at level-4), a new level-2 backup is made, and so on.  Each differential
       backup contains the changes towards the previous backup of the same or a lower level.

       This scheme allows one to efficiently generate small incremental backups at short intervals.  At the same
       time,  the  total  number of archives that have to be stored (or processed in the case of a restore) only
       increases logarithmically with the number of backups since the  last  full  backup.  Time-consuming  full
       backups  are  only  sparsely needed.  In the example above, a new full backup is only necessary after 780
       (=5^4+5^3+5*5+5) days, while only at most 20 (=4*5) archives have to be processed.

       For <b>backup2l</b>, each backup archive is identified by its <b>backup</b> <b>ID</b> <b>(BID)</b>. The number of  digits  determines
       the level. Level-0 (full) backups have a 1-digit BID, level-n backups have a BID of n+1 digits.  The last
       digit  is a serial number, the prefix identifies the lower-level backups on which a given backup is based
       on. For example, the archive 235 contains the differences towards archive 234, and to  restore  the  file
       system  state  of  the  time  it was generated, the full backup 2, the level-1 backups 21, 22, 23 and the
       level-2 backups 231, ..., 235 have to be processed.  All serial numbers are between 1 and 9,  a  zero  in
       the  BID  indicates  that  no archive of the respective level is contained in the chain. For example, the
       level-3 backup 1201 is immediately based on the level-1 backup 12.

       For deciding whether a file is new or modified, <b>backup2l</b> looks at  its  name,  modification  time,  size,
       ownership  and  permissions.  Unlike  other  backup tools, the i-node is not considered in order to avoid
       problems with non-Unix file systems like FAT32.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c,</b> <b>--conf</b> <u>conffile</u>
              This argument specifies the configuration file (default: <b>etc/backup2l.conf</b>).

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--time</b> <u>BID</u>
              If present, this option selects a certain backup for the <b>--locate</b> and <b>--restore</b> commands.  E.  g.,
              the  latter will restore files and directories exactly as they were on the system at the time when
              the specified backup was made. If not present, the latest available backup is selected.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display the usage info.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--estimate</b> [ <u>level</u> ]
              Prints the number of files, estimated amount of data and other  information  on  the  backup  that
              would  be  generated  next.  No backup archives are actually created or removed. If specified, the
              parameter <b>level</b> overrides the <b>MAX_LEVEL</b> setting.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--backup</b> [ <u>level</u> ]
              Creates a new backup and  removes  old  archives  based  on  the  given  configuration  file.   If
              specified,  the  parameter  <b>level</b>  overrides  the  <b>MAX_LEVEL</b> setting. This is useful e. g. shortly
              before or after major changes are performed with the file system. In  this  case,  a  lower  level
              should  be  specified  in order to avoid that a large number of files are backed up multiple times
              again.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--get-summary</b>
              Shows a table describing each backup (date, size, files, ...) and the file  system  usage  of  the
              backup device.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--get-available</b> [ <u>pattern</u> <u>list</u> ]
              Shows  all files removed and added for all backups. A '+' in the output indicates that the file is
              new and thus contained in the archive file. A '-' indicates that the file  has  been  removed  (or
              replaced).   If  one  or  several  patterns  are supplied, <b><a href="../man1/grep.1.html">grep</a>(1)</b> is used to filter the list. All
              status messages go to <b>stderr</b>, so that the generated file list can easily be redirected.

              <b>Note:</b> The search pattern is not just applied to the file names, but to  the  whole  entry  in  the
              <b>.list.gz</b>  file.  This  allows  one to not only search for file names but also for other attributes
              like ownership, modification time etc. . In order to apply a search pattern to  file  names  only,
              precede it by "&lt;space&gt;<a href="file:/.">/.</a>*".

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--locate</b> [ <u>pattern</u> <u>list</u> ]
              Shows  most  recent  backup  location  for  active files. If one or several patterns are supplied,
              <b><a href="../man1/grep.1.html">grep</a>(1)</b> is used to filter the list in the same way as for <b>--get-available</b> (see above) . All status
              messages go to <b>stderr</b>, so that the generated file list can easily be redirected.

              Active files are files that have been on the system at the time of the selected backup,  which  is
              either  the  latest  backup or the one specified by <b>--time</b> (see above). Files that were removed at
              that time but are still stored in some later archive will not be shown.

              Altogether, this command tells you, which files have to be extracted from which archive  in  order
              to restore the state of the system at the time of the selected backup.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--restore</b> [ <u>pattern</u> <u>list</u> ]
              Performs  the  same  steps  like  <b>--locate</b>  and  then restores the respective files. All files are
              restored relative to the current directory. They can be restored to  their  original  location  by
              cd'ing into / before, but this is not recommended.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--purge</b> <u>BID</u> <u>list</u>
              Removes the specified backup archive(s) and all depending backups.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--make-check</b> [ <u>BID</u> <u>list</u> ]
              Creates  (a)  check file(s) for the specified archive(s) using <b><a href="../man1/md5sum.1.html">md5sum</a>(1)</b>.  If no BID is specified,
              check files are created wherever missing.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verify</b> [ <u>BID</u> <u>list</u> ]
              Verifies the specified backup archive(s). If no  BID  is  specified,  all  existing  archives  are
              checked.   If  a  check  file  exists,  this allows one a comprehensive test including e. g. media
              failures. If the check file is missing, only the existence of all files  and  the  immediate  base
              archive are verified.

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--extract</b> <u>capacity</u> <u>max-free</u> <u>BID-list</u>
              Split  and  collect  files  to  be  stored  on removable media (e. g. CDs). <b>capacity</b> is the medium
              capacity in MB. <b>max-free</b> is the maximum amount of empty space on each medium (except for the  last
              one,  of  course).  <b>BID-list</b> specifies the archives and may contain wildcards, e. g.: 1 '2*'.  The
              operation generates enumbered subdirectories representing the media contents.  Some more files are
              generated that may be useful, e. g. to print labels.

              While guaranteeing a minimum waste of <b>max-free</b> MB per medium, the collection  procedure  preserves
              the  ordering  of  files  and  keeps  all  control files of an archive always together on the same
              medium.  Large archive files are split into multiple files with serial numbers appended  to  their
              names.

              The  operation  is  interactive. Just run it and look what it is about to do.  If that is not what
              you want, you can stop it.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       In the configuration file (<b>/etc/backup2l.conf</b> by default),  the  following  variables  have  to  be  set,
       following the <b><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a>(1)</b> syntax:

       <b>FOR_VERSION=</b><u>version</u>
              Defines  the  <b>backup2l</b>  version  for  which  the  configuration  file is written. This way, future
              versions can automatically print a warning if the syntax has changed.

       <b>SRCLIST=(</b> <u>source</u> <u>list</u> <b>)</b>
              This is a blank-separated list of all top-level directories to make backups of.   Directory  names
              with  spaces have to be quoted, e. g.: SRCLIST=("/my dir" /another/dir).  The last elements of the
              list may be options for <b><a href="../man1/find.1.html">find</a>(1)</b>. For example <b>-xdev</b> can be used  to  skip  subdirs  on  other  file
              systems such as <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a> or <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a>, or <b>-L</b> will cause all symbolic links to be followed (use with care).

       <b>SKIPCOND=(</b> <u>find</u> <u>condition</u> <b>)</b>
              Files  for  which  this  condition  is  'true'  are  not  considered  for backup.  See <b><a href="../man1/find.1.html">find</a>(1)</b> for
              information on how to formulate possible conditions.  Special characters ("(", ")", "!", ...) must
              be quoted by a leading backslash ("\(", "\)", " \!", ...). An empty condition (i. e. if you do not
              want any files to be skipped) must be specified as "( -false )".

       <b>[</b> <b>BACKUP_DEV="</b><u>mount_point</u><b>"</b> <b>]</b>
              If defined, <b>backup2l</b> mounts the backup device before any operation.  Afterwards, it  is  unmounted
              unless it was already mounted before.

       <b>BACKUP_DIR="</b><u>backup</u> <u>dir</u><b>"</b>
              Destination  directory  for  backup  files.  This  must  be  different  from <b>MOUNT_POINT</b>, i. e.  a
              subdirectory on the device.

       <b>VOLNAME="</b><u>volname</u><b>"</b>
              This is a common prefix for all backup and control files. Multiple backup volumes are possible  if
              for each volume a separate configuration file is written.

       <b>MAX_LEVEL=</b><u>max_level</u>
              Maximum backup level. Possible values are 1..9.

       <b>MAX_PER_LEVEL=</b><u>max_per_level</u>
              Number of differential backups per level. Possible values are 1..9.

       <b>MAX_FULL=</b><u>max_full</u>
              Number of full backups kept. Possible values are 1..8.

       <b>GENERATIONS=</b><u>generations</u>
              Number  of  backup  generations  to  keep  for  each non-zero level. Old backups are automatically
              removed as long as at least <b>GENERATIONS</b> <b>*</b> <b>MAX_PER_LEVEL</b> backups for the respective level remain.

              For example, with <b>MAX_LEVEL=3,</b> <b>MAX_PER_LEVEL=5,</b> <b>GENERATIONS=2</b> it is always possible to access  the
              last  10 level-3 (e. g. daily) backups, the last 10 level-2 backups (e. g. 5, 10, 15, ..., 50 days
              old), and so on.

       <b>PRE_BACKUP</b> <b>()</b> <b>{</b> <u>do</u> <u>something</u> <b>}</b>
              This function is called before writing the backup. It can be used to dump  some  important  system
              information, e. g. the HD's partition table, to a file which is then backed up.

       <b>POST_BACKUP</b> <b>()</b> <b>{</b> <u>do</u> <u>something</u> <b>}</b>
              This  function is called after writing the backup. Together with <b>PRE_BACKUP</b> it can be used to stop
              and restart e. g. database or mail services which may frequently alter some files that have to  be
              backed up.

       <b>[</b> <b>AUTORUN=1</b> <b>]</b>
              If  set to 1, <b>backup2l</b> performs the <b>--backup</b> operation when invoked without arguments.  Otherwise,
              the usage information is shown.

       <b>[</b> <b>SIZE_UNITS=</b> <u>B</u> <u>|</u> <u>K</u> <u>|</u> <u>M</u> <u>|</u> <u>G</u> <b>]</b>
              Sets the units for archive sizes in summary listings to  bytes,  KB,  MB,  or  GB.   If  unset,  a
              user-readable  format is chosen automatically. If set, the units are the same for the whole table,
              which may be even more user-friendly.

       <b>[</b> <b>CREATE_DRIVER="</b><u>archive</u> <u>driver</u><b>"</b> <b>]</b>
              Selects an archive driver for creating backups. An archive  driver  is  responsible  for  managing
              backup files. If unset, the default driver "DRIVER_TAR_GZ" is used. The <b>--help</b> operation lists all
              available drivers. More drivers can be defined in the configuration file (see below).

       <b>[</b> <b>USER_DRIVER_LIST="</b><u>user-defined</u> <u>drivers</u><b>"</b> <b>]</b>
              Declares additional, user-defined archive drivers which are implemented in the configuration file.
              The  sample  configuration  file  contains  a  commented example. Read it in order to learn how to
              implement your own driver.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/backup2l.conf</b>
              Configuration file.

       <u>VOLNAME</u><b>.</b><u>BID</u><b>.tar.gz,</b> <u>VOLNAME</u><b>.</b><u>BID</u><b>.afioz,</b> <b>...</b>
              Archive files.

       <u>VOLNAME</u><b>.</b><u>BID</u><b>.list.gz</b>
              List of all active files when  the  backup  was  made.  Each  file  is  preceded  with  its  size,
              modification time, and other information.

       <u>VOLNAME</u><b>.</b><u>BID</u><b>.new.gz</b>
              List  of  all  new  ore  modified files when the backup was made (pathnames only). Unless an error
              occurred, this list reflects the contents of the archive.

       <u>VOLNAME</u><b>.</b><u>BID</u><b>.obsolete.gz</b>
              List of all obsolete files when the backup was made (pathnames only).

       <u>VOLNAME</u><b>.</b><u>BID</u><b>.skipped.gz</b>
              Complete list of all files that were skipped according to <b>SKIPMASK</b>.

       <u>VOLNAME</u><b>.</b><u>BID</u><b>.error.gz</b>
              This file is generated by comparing the <b>.new.gz</b>  file  with  the  actual  archive  contents  using
              <b><a href="../man1/diff.1.html">diff</a>(1)</b>. If the error file is non-empty, something may have gone wrong.

       <u>VOLNAME</u><b>.</b><u>BID</u><b>.check</b>
              MD5  check  sums  of  all  files of the present archive and the <b>.list.gz</b> file of the base archive.
              This file is optional and may be used by the <b>--verify</b> operation.

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b> <b>BY</b> <b>CRON</b></h4><pre>
       <b>backup2l</b> is designed to be run autonomously as a cron job.  If the variable <b>AUTORUN</b> is set, it  generates
       a backup if invoked without any parameters, and you can simply create a symlink, e. g. by:

                                ln -s `command -v backup2l` /etc/cron.daily/zz-backup2l

       The "zz-" prefix causes the backup job to be the last one executed, so that other jobs are not delayed if
       the backup takes somewhat longer. The status output is e-mailed to root by the cron daemon.

</pre><h4><b>MANIPULATING</b> <b>FILES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CONFIGURATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>backup2l</b>  has been designed to be robust with respect to errors and configuration changes.  If the backup
       process is interrupted, e. g. because of a shutdown while it is running, no serious data  corruption  can
       occur.  Some  temporary  files  may  remain  which are cleaned up during the next run. If file is changed
       during the backup generation, it may not be contained in the current backup. However,  it  is  guaranteed
       that it is considered modified during the next backup.

       In  order to save disk space, e. g. after some archives have been copied to external media, archive files
       (.tar.gz or .afioz, for example) can safely be removed from the backup directory.  As long as all control
       files are kept, <b>backup2l</b> retains full functionality as far as possible.  The  <b>--restore</b>  command  prompts
       for  eventually  missing archive files for the respective request (and only those). The <b>--extract</b> command
       completely ignores all backups with missing archive files.

       The configuration, especially the settings for <b>MAX_LEVEL</b>,  <b>MAX_PER_LEVEL</b>, <b>MAX_FULL</b> and the  specification
       of  source  files,  can  be  arbitrarily  changed without having to expect data corruption. <b>backup2l</b> will
       gracefully adapt the new settings during the next run.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       After a restore operation, the modification time of directories is equal to the  restoration  time  while
       for files it is equal to the original modification time.
