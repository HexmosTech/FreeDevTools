</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rpcbind — universal addresses to RPC program number mapper

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rpcbind</b> [<b>-adhiLlsr</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>rpcbind</b>  utility is a server that converts RPC program numbers into universal addresses.  It must be
       running on the host to be able to make RPC calls on a server on that machine.

       When an RPC service is started, it tells <b>rpcbind</b> the address at  which  it  is  listening,  and  the  RPC
       program  numbers  it  is  prepared to serve.  When a client wishes to make an RPC call to a given program
       number, it first contacts <b>rpcbind</b> on the server machine to  determine  the  address  where  RPC  requests
       should be sent.

       The  <b>rpcbind</b>  utility should be started before any other RPC service.  Normally, standard RPC servers are
       started by port monitors, so <b>rpcbind</b> must be started before port monitors are invoked.

       When <b>rpcbind</b> is started, it checks that certain name-to-address translation-calls function correctly.  If
       they fail, the network configuration databases may  be  corrupt.   Since  RPC  services  cannot  function
       correctly in this situation, <b>rpcbind</b> reports the condition and terminates.

       The <b>rpcbind</b> utility can only be started by the super-user.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>      When debugging (<b>-d</b>), do an abort on errors.

       <b>-d</b>      Run  in  debug mode.  In this mode, <b>rpcbind</b> will log additional information during operation, and
               will abort on certain errors if <b>-a</b> is also specified.   With  this  option,  the  name-to-address
               translation consistency checks are shown in detail.

       <b>-f</b>      Do not fork and become a background process.

       <b>-h</b>      Specify specific IP addresses to bind to for UDP requests.  This option may be specified multiple
               times  and  can  be  used to restrict the interfaces rpcbind will respond to.  When specifying IP
               addresses with <b>-h</b>, <b>rpcbind</b> will automatically add <b>127.0.0.1</b> and if IPv6 is enabled,  <b>::1</b>  to  the
               list.   If  no  <b>-h</b>  option  is  specified,  <b>rpcbind</b>  will bind to INADDR_ANY, which could lead to
               problems on a multi-homed host due to <b>rpcbind</b> returning a UDP packet from a different IP  address
               than  it  was sent to.  Note that when <b>rpcbind</b> is controlled via systemd's socket activation, the
               <b>-h</b> option is ignored. In this case, you need to edit the <b>ListenStream</b> and <b>ListenDgram</b> definitions
               in <b>/usr/lib/systemd/system/rpcbind.socket</b> instead.

       <b>-i</b>      “Insecure” mode.  Allow calls to SET and UNSET from any host.   Normally  <b>rpcbind</b>  accepts  these
               requests  only  from  the  loopback interface for security reasons.  This change is necessary for
               programs that were compiled with earlier versions of the  rpc  library  and  do  not  make  those
               requests using the loopback interface.

       <b>-l</b>      Turn on libwrap connection logging.

       <b>-s</b>      Cause  <b>rpcbind</b> to change to the user daemon as soon as possible.  This causes <b>rpcbind</b> to use non-
               privileged ports for outgoing connections, preventing non-privileged clients from  using  <b>rpcbind</b>
               to connect to services from a privileged port.

       <b>-w</b>      Cause <b>rpcbind</b> to do a "warm start" by read a state file when <b>rpcbind</b> starts up. The state file is
               created when <b>rpcbind</b> terminates.

       <b>-r</b>      Turn  on  remote  calls.  Cause <b>rpcbind</b> to open up random listening ports. Note that rpcinfo need
               this feature turned on for work properly. (This flag is a Debian extension.)

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       If "/etc/default/rpcbind" exists, rpcbind will use the specified options at launch time <b>rpcbind</b> Otherwise
       rpcbind will try to load configuration from "/etc/rppcbind.conf" <b>rpcbind</b> The default options are  set  as
       "-w -f".

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       All RPC servers must be restarted if <b>rpcbind</b> is restarted.
