       exim_checkaccess - Check address acceptance from given IP

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>exim_checkaccess</b> <u>IP-address</u> <u>email@address</u> <u>[more</u> <u>Exim</u> <u>options]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Exim's</b> <u>-bh</u> command line argument allows you to run a fake SMTP session with debugging output, in order to
       check  what  Exim  is  doing  when  it  is  applying policy controls to incoming SMTP mail.  However, not
       everybody is sufficiently familiar with the SMTP protocol to be  able  to  make  full  use  of  -bh,  and
       sometimes  you  just  want to answer the question “Does this address have access?” without bothering with
       any further details.

       The <b>exim_checkaccess</b> utility is a ‘packaged’ version of <u>-bh.</u>  It takes two arguments, an IP  address  and
       an email address:

         exim_checkaccess 10.9.8.7 <a href="mailto:A.User@a.domain.example">A.User@a.domain.example</a>

       The  utility  runs  a  call to <b>Exim</b> with the -bh option, to test whether the given email address would be
       accepted in a RCPT command in a TCP/IP connection from the host with the given IP address.  The output of
       the utility is either the word ‘accepted’, or the SMTP error response, for example:

         Rejected:
           550 Relay not permitted

       When running this test, the utility uses “&lt;&gt;” as the envelope sender address for the  MAIL  command,  but
       you can change this by providing additional options.  These are passed directly to the Exim command.  For
       example,  to  specify  that the test is to be run with the sender address “<a href="mailto:himself@there.example">himself@there.example</a>” you can
       use:

         exim_checkaccess 10.9.8.7 <a href="mailto:A.User@a.domain.example">A.User@a.domain.example</a> \
                          -f <a href="mailto:himself@there.example">himself@there.example</a>

       Note that these additional Exim command line items must be given after the two mandatory arguments.
