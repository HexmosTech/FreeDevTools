</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>address</b> is a protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) address attached to a network device. Each device must have at
       least one address to use the corresponding protocol. It is possible to have several different addresses
       attached to one device. These addresses are not discriminated, so that the term <b>alias</b> is not quite
       appropriate for them and we do not use it in this document.

       The <b>ip</b> <b>address</b> command displays addresses and their properties, adds new addresses and deletes old ones.

   <b>ip</b> <b>address</b> <b>add</b> <b>-</b> <b>add</b> <b>new</b> <b>protocol</b> <b>address.</b>
       <b>dev</b> <u>IFNAME</u>
              the name of the device to add the address to.

       <b>local</b> <u>ADDRESS</u> <b>(default)</b>
              the  address  of  the interface. The format of the address depends on the protocol. It is a dotted
              quad for IP and a sequence of hexadecimal halfwords separated by colons for IPv6. The <u>ADDRESS</u>  may
              be followed by a slash and a decimal number which encodes the network prefix length.

       <b>peer</b> <u>ADDRESS</u>
              the address of the remote endpoint for pointopoint interfaces.  Again, the <u>ADDRESS</u> may be followed
              by  a  slash  and  a  decimal  number,  encoding  the  network prefix length. If a peer address is
              specified, the local address cannot have a prefix length. The network prefix  is  associated  with
              the peer rather than with the local address.

       <b>broadcast</b> <u>ADDRESS</u>
              the broadcast address on the interface.

              It  is  possible  to use the special symbols <b>'+'</b> and <b>'-'</b> instead of the broadcast address. In this
              case, the broadcast address is derived by setting/resetting the host bits of the interface prefix.

       <b>label</b> <u>LABEL</u>
              Each address may be tagged with a label string.  The maximum allowed total length of label  is  15
              characters.

       <b>scope</b> <u>SCOPE_VALUE</u>
              the  scope  of  the  area  where  this  address  is  valid.   The  available  scopes are listed in
              <b>/usr/share/iproute2/rt_scopes</b> or <b><a href="file:/etc/iproute2/rt_scopes">/etc/iproute2/rt_scopes</a></b> (has precedence if  exists).   Predefined
              scope values are:

                      <b>global</b> - the address is globally valid.

                      <b>site</b>  -  (IPv6  only,  deprecated) the address is site local, i.e. it is valid inside this
                      site.

                      <b>link</b> - the address is link local, i.e. it is valid only on this device.

                      <b>host</b> - the address is valid only inside this host.

       <b>metric</b> <u>NUMBER</u>
              priority of prefix route associated with address.

       <b>valid_lft</b> <u>LFT</u>
              the valid lifetime of this address; see section 5.5.4 of RFC 4862. When it expires, the address is
              removed by the kernel.  Defaults to <b>forever</b>.

       <b>preferred_lft</b> <u>LFT</u>
              the preferred lifetime of this address; see section 5.5.4  of  RFC  4862.  When  it  expires,  the
              address is no longer used for new outgoing connections. Defaults to <b>forever</b>.

       <b>home</b>   (IPv6 only) designates this address the "home address" as defined in RFC 6275.

       <b>mngtmpaddr</b>
              (IPv6 only) make the kernel manage temporary addresses created from this one as template on behalf
              of Privacy Extensions (RFC3041). For this to become active, the <b>use_tempaddr</b> sysctl setting has to
              be  set to a value greater than zero.  The given address needs to have a prefix length of 64. This
              flag allows to use privacy extensions in a manually configured network,  just  like  if  stateless
              auto-configuration was active.

       <b>nodad</b>  (IPv6 only) do not perform Duplicate Address Detection (RFC 4862) when adding this address.

       <b>optimistic</b>
              (IPv6 only) When performing Duplicate Address Detection, use the RFC 4429 optimistic variant.

       <b>noprefixroute</b>
              Do  not automatically create a route for the network prefix of the added address, and don't search
              for one to delete when removing the address. Changing an address to add this flag will remove  the
              automatically  added  prefix  route,  changing it to remove this flag will create the prefix route
              automatically.

       <b>autojoin</b>
              Joining multicast groups on Ethernet level via <b>ip</b> <b>maddr</b> command does not work if connected  to  an
              Ethernet  switch that does IGMP snooping since the switch would not replicate multicast packets on
              ports that did not have IGMP reports for the multicast addresses.

              Linux VXLAN interfaces created via <b>ip</b> <b>link</b> <b>add</b> <b>vxlan</b> have the <b>group</b> option that enables them to do
              the required join.

              Using the <b>autojoin</b> flag  when  adding  a  multicast  address  enables  similar  functionality  for
              Openvswitch  VXLAN interfaces as well as other tunneling mechanisms that need to receive multicast
              traffic.

       <b>proto</b> <u>ADDRPROTO</u>
              the protocol identifier of this route.  <u>ADDRPROTO</u> may be a  number  or  a  string  from  the  file
              <b>/usr/share/iproute2/rt_addrprotos</b>  or  <b>/etc/iproute2/rt_addrprotos</b>  (has precedence if exists).  A
              directory named <b>rt_addrprotos.d</b> is also scanned in either location.  If the  protocol  ID  is  not
              given,

              <b>ip</b> <b>assumes</b> <b>protocol</b> <b>0.</b> <b>Several</b> <b>protocol</b> values have a fixed interpretation. Namely:

                      <b>kernel_lo</b> - The ::1 address that kernel installs on a loopback netdevice has this
                        protocol value

                      <b>kernel_ra</b> - IPv6 addresses installed in response to router advertisement messages

                      <b>kernel_ll</b> - Link-local addresses have this protocol value

              The rest of the values are not reserved and the administrator is free to assign (or not to assign)
              protocol tags.

   <b>ip</b> <b>address</b> <b>delete</b> <b>-</b> <b>delete</b> <b>protocol</b> <b>address</b>
       <b>Arguments:</b> coincide with the arguments of <b>ip</b> <b>address</b> <b>add.</b>

       The device name is a required argument.

   <b>ip</b> <b>address</b> <b>show</b> <b>-</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>protocol</b> <b>addresses</b>
       <b>dev</b> <u>IFNAME</u> <b>(default)</b>
              name of device.

       <b>scope</b> <u>SCOPE_VAL</u>
              only list addresses with this scope.

       <b>to</b> <u>PREFIX</u>
              only list addresses matching this prefix.

       <b>label</b> <u>PATTERN</u>
              only list addresses with labels matching the <u>PATTERN</u>.  <u>PATTERN</u> is a usual shell style pattern.

       <b>master</b> <u>DEVICE</u>
              only list interfaces enslaved to this master device.

       <b>vrf</b> <u>NAME</u>
              only list interfaces enslaved to this vrf.

       <b>type</b> <u>TYPE</u>
              only list interfaces of the given type.

              Note  that  the  type name is not checked against the list of supported types - instead it is sent
              as-is to the kernel. Later it is used to filter the returned interface list by comparing  it  with
              the relevant attribute in case the kernel didn't filter already. Therefore any string is accepted,
              but may lead to empty output.

       <b>up</b>     only list running interfaces.

       <b>down</b>   only list not running interfaces.

       <b>nomaster</b>
              only list interfaces with no master.

       <b>dynamic</b> and <b>permanent</b>
              (IPv6  only)  only  list  addresses  installed due to stateless address configuration or only list
              permanent (not dynamic) addresses. These two flags are inverses of  each  other,  so  <b>-dynamic</b>  is
              equal to <b>permanent</b> and <b>-permanent</b> is equal to <b>dynamic</b>.

       <b>tentative</b>
              (IPv6 only) only list addresses which have not yet passed duplicate address detection.

       <b>-tentative</b>
              (IPv6  only)  only  list  addresses  which  are  not in the process of duplicate address detection
              currently.

       <b>deprecated</b>
              (IPv6 only) only list deprecated addresses.

       <b>-deprecated</b>
              (IPv6 only) only list addresses not being deprecated.

       <b>dadfailed</b>
              (IPv6 only) only list addresses which have failed duplicate address detection.

       <b>-dadfailed</b>
              (IPv6 only) only list addresses which have not failed duplicate address detection.

       <b>temporary</b> or <b>secondary</b>
              List temporary IPv6 or secondary IPv4 addresses only. The Linux kernel shares  a  single  bit  for
              those,  so  they  are  actually  aliases  for each other although the meaning differs depending on
              address family.

       <b>-temporary</b> or <b>-secondary</b>
              These flags are aliases for <b>primary</b>.

       <b>primary</b>
              List only primary addresses, in IPv6 exclude temporary ones. This flag is the inverse of <b>temporary</b>
              and <b>secondary</b>.

       <b>-primary</b>
              This is an alias for <b>temporary</b> or <b>secondary</b>.

       <b>proto</b> <u>ADDRPROTO</u>
              Only show addresses with a given protocol, or those for which the kernel response did not  include
              protocol. See the corresponding argument to <b>ip</b> <b>address</b> <b>add</b> for details about address protocols.

   <b>ip</b> <b>address</b> <b>flush</b> <b>-</b> <b>flush</b> <b>protocol</b> <b>addresses</b>
       This command flushes the protocol addresses selected by some criteria.

       This  command  has  the  same  arguments as <b>show</b> except that <b>type</b> and <b>master</b> selectors are not supported.
       Another difference is that it does not run when no arguments are given.

       <b>Warning:</b> This command and other  <b>flush</b>  commands  are  unforgiving.  They  will  cruelly  purge  all  the
       addresses.

       With  the  <b>-statistics</b> option, the command becomes verbose. It prints out the number of deleted addresses
       and the number of rounds made to flush the address list.  If this option is given twice, <b>ip</b> <b>address</b> <b>flush</b>
       also dumps all the deleted addresses in the format described in the previous subsection.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       ip address show
           Shows IPv4 and IPv6 addresses assigned to all  network  interfaces.  The  'show'  subcommand  can  be
           omitted.

       ip address show up
           Same as above except that only addresses assigned to active network interfaces are shown.

       ip address show dev eth0
           Shows IPv4 and IPv6 addresses assigned to network interface eth0.

       ip address add 2001:0db8:85a3::0370:7334/64 dev eth1
           Adds an IPv6 address to network interface eth1.

       ip address delete 2001:0db8:85a3::0370:7334/64 dev eth1
           Delete the IPv6 address added above.

       ip address flush dev eth4 scope global
           Removes  all  global IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from device eth4. Without 'scope global' it would remove
           all addresses including IPv6 link-local ones.
