</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sendinpaths - Send Usenet Path header field statistics via e-mail

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sendinpaths</b> [<b>-cdhn</b>] [<b>-k</b> <u>keep-days</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>report-days</u>] [<u>address</u> [<u>address</u> ...]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sendinpaths</b> checks <u>pathlog</u>/path for <b>ninpaths</b> dump files, finds dump files generated in the past <u>report-</u>
       <u>days</u> days, makes sure they are valid by running <b>ninpaths</b> on each one and making sure the exit status is
       zero, and passes them to <b>ninpaths</b> to generate a cumulative report.  By default, that report is mailed to
       the e-mail addresses configured at the beginning of this script (by default, only one address is
       configured: &lt;<a href="mailto:top1000@anthologeek.net">top1000@anthologeek.net</a>&gt;) in order to supply the TOP1000 project with useful statistics.
       See &lt;<a href="http://top1000.anthologeek.net/">http://top1000.anthologeek.net/</a>&gt; for more information.

       When finished, <b>sendinpaths</b> deletes all dump files in <u>pathlog</u>/path that are older than <u>keep-days</u> days.

       For more information on how to set up <b>ninpaths</b>, see <a href="../man8/ninpaths.8.html">ninpaths</a>(8).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>  When  this  flag  is  used,  the report is also e-mailed, besides the default submission addresses or
           those given as command-line arguments, to the newsmaster's address set at configure time.

       <b>-d</b>  Enables debug messages.

       <b>-h</b>  Gives usage information.

       <b>-k</b> <u>keep-days</u>
           After having processed dump files, <b>sendinpaths</b> removes those that are older than <u>keep-days</u> days.  The
           default is "0", that is to say to remove all dump files.

           Setting <u>keep-days</u> to another value can be useful for debugging purpose because it permits  keeping  a
           few dump files.

       <b>-n</b>  Don't e-mail the report; instead, just print it to standard output.  Don't delete old dump files.

       <b>-r</b> <u>report-days</u>
           Process  dump  files generated during the last <u>report-days</u> days.  The default is "32", that is to say
           to process all the dump files that have been generated during the last 32 days (if, of  course,  they
           have  not  been  deleted  yet  by  a previous run of <b>sendinpaths</b> according to the value set by the <b>-k</b>
           flag).

       <u>address</u> ...
           E-mail the report to the mentioned address  or  addresses,  instead  of  the  default  one.   Several
           addresses  can be used, separated by whitespace (sending the e-mail to your own e-mail address can be
           useful for debugging purpose, to check that everything works fine).  For instance, for two addresses:

               sendinpaths <a href="mailto:pathsurvey@example.org">pathsurvey@example.org</a> <a href="mailto:top1000@anthologeek.net">top1000@anthologeek.net</a>

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sendinpaths</b> was originally written by Olaf Titz &lt;<a href="mailto:olaf@bigred.inka.de">olaf@bigred.inka.de</a>&gt; in shell.  The version shipped with
       INN is a rewrite in Perl based on Mohan Kokal's initial work, and improved by Julien Ã‰lie.
