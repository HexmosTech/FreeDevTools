</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apt-cache</b> performs a variety of operations on APT's package cache.  <b>apt-cache</b> does not manipulate the
       state of the system but does provide operations to search and generate interesting output from the
       package metadata. The metadata is acquired and updated via the 'update' command of e.g.  <b>apt-get</b>, so that
       it can be outdated if the last update is too long ago, but in exchange <b>apt-cache</b> works independently of
       the availability of the configured sources (e.g. offline).

       Unless the <b>-h</b>, or <b>--help</b> option is given, one of the commands below must be present.

       <b>gencaches</b>
           gencaches creates APT's package cache. This is done implicitly by all commands needing this cache if
           it is missing or outdated.

       <b>showpkg</b> <u>pkg</u><b>...</b>
           showpkg displays information about the packages listed on the command line. Remaining arguments are
           package names. The available versions and reverse dependencies of each package listed are listed, as
           well as forward dependencies for each version. Forward (normal) dependencies are those packages upon
           which the package in question depends; reverse dependencies are those packages that depend upon the
           package in question. Thus, forward dependencies must be satisfied for a package, but reverse
           dependencies need not be. For instance, <b>apt-cache</b> <b>showpkg</b> <b>libreadline2</b> would produce output similar
           to the following:

               Package: libreadline2
               Versions: 2.1-12(/var/state/apt/lists/foo_Packages),
               Reverse Depends:
                 libreadlineg2,libreadline2
                 libreadline2-altdev,libreadline2
               Dependencies:
               2.1-12 - libc5 (2 5.4.0-0) ncurses3.0 (0 (null))
               Provides:
               2.1-12 -
               Reverse Provides:
           Thus it may be seen that libreadline2, version 2.1-12, depends on libc5 and ncurses3.0 which must be
           installed for libreadline2 to work. In turn, libreadlineg2 and libreadline2-altdev depend on
           libreadline2. If libreadline2 is installed, libc5 and ncurses3.0 (and ldso) must also be installed;
           libreadlineg2 and libreadline2-altdev do not have to be installed. For the specific meaning of the
           remainder of the output it is best to consult the apt source code.

       <b>stats</b>
           stats displays some statistics about the cache. No further arguments are expected. Statistics
           reported are:

           •   Total package names is the number of package names found in the cache.

           •   Normal packages is the number of regular, ordinary package names; these are packages that bear a
               one-to-one correspondence between their names and the names used by other packages for them in
               dependencies. The majority of packages fall into this category.

           •   Pure virtual packages is the number of packages that exist only as a virtual package name; that
               is, packages only "provide" the virtual package name, and no package actually uses the name. For
               instance, "mail-transport-agent" in the Debian system is a pure virtual package; several packages
               provide "mail-transport-agent", but there is no package named "mail-transport-agent".

           •   Single virtual packages is the number of packages with only one package providing a particular
               virtual package. For example, in the Debian system, "X11-text-viewer" is a virtual package, but
               only one package, xless, provides "X11-text-viewer".

           •   Mixed virtual packages is the number of packages that either provide a particular virtual package
               or have the virtual package name as the package name. For instance, in the Debian system,
               "debconf" is both an actual package, and provided by the debconf-tiny package.

           •   Missing is the number of package names that were referenced in a dependency but were not provided
               by any package. Missing packages may be an evidence if a full distribution is not accessed, or if
               a package (real or virtual) has been dropped from the distribution. Usually they are referenced
               from Conflicts or Breaks statements.

           •   Total distinct versions is the number of package versions found in the cache. If more than one
               distribution is being accessed (for instance, "stable" and "unstable"), this value can be
               considerably larger than the number of total package names.

           •   Total dependencies is the number of dependency relationships claimed by all of the packages in
               the cache.

       <b>showsrc</b> <u>pkg</u><b>...</b>
           showsrc displays all the source package records that match the given package names. All versions are
           shown, as well as all records that declare the name to be a binary package. Use <b>--only-source</b> to
           display only source package names.

       <b>dump</b>
           dump shows a short listing of every package in the cache. It is primarily for debugging.

       <b>dumpavail</b>
           dumpavail prints out an available list to stdout. This is suitable for use with <b><a href="../man1/dpkg.1.html">dpkg</a></b>(1) and is used
           by the <b><a href="../man1/dselect.1.html">dselect</a></b>(1) method.

       <b>unmet</b>
           unmet displays a summary of all unmet dependencies in the package cache.

       <b>show</b> <u>pkg</u><b>...</b>
           show performs a function similar to <b>dpkg</b> <b>--print-avail</b>; it displays the package records for the named
           packages.

       <b>search</b> <u>regex</u><b>...</b>
           search performs a full text search on all available package lists for the POSIX regex pattern given,
           see <b><a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex</a></b>(7). It searches the package names and the descriptions for an occurrence of the regular
           expression and prints out the package name and the short description, including virtual package
           names. If <b>--full</b> is given then output identical to show is produced for each matched package, and if
           <b>--names-only</b> is given then the long description is not searched, only the package name and provided
           packages are.

           Separate arguments can be used to specify multiple search patterns that are and'ed together.

       <b>depends</b> <u>pkg</u><b>...</b>
           depends shows a listing of each dependency a package has and all the possible other packages that can
           fulfill that dependency.

       <b>rdepends</b> <u>pkg</u><b>...</b>
           rdepends shows a listing of each reverse dependency a package has.

       <b>pkgnames</b> [<u>prefix</u>]
           This command prints the name of each package APT knows. The optional argument is a prefix match to
           filter the name list. The output is suitable for use in a shell tab complete function and the output
           is generated extremely quickly. This command is best used with the <b>--generate</b> option.

           Note that a package which APT knows of is not necessarily available to download, installable or
           installed, e.g. virtual packages are also listed in the generated list.

       <b>dotty</b> <u>pkg</u><b>...</b>
           dotty takes a list of packages on the command line and generates output suitable for use by dotty
           from the <b>GraphViz</b>[1] package. The result will be a set of nodes and edges representing the
           relationships between the packages. By default the given packages will trace out all dependent
           packages; this can produce a very large graph. To limit the output to only the packages listed on the
           command line, set the APT::Cache::GivenOnly option.

           The resulting nodes will have several shapes; normal packages are boxes, pure virtual packages are
           triangles, mixed virtual packages are diamonds, missing packages are hexagons. Orange boxes mean
           recursion was stopped (leaf packages), blue lines are pre-depends, green lines are conflicts.

           Caution, dotty cannot graph larger sets of packages.

       <b>xvcg</b> <u>pkg</u><b>...</b>
           The same as dotty, only for xvcg from the <b>VCG</b> <b>tool</b>[2].

       <b>policy</b> [<u>pkg</u>...]
           policy is meant to help debug issues relating to the preferences file. With no arguments it will
           print out the priorities of each source. Otherwise it prints out detailed information about the
           priority selection of the named package.

       <b>madison</b> <u>pkg</u><b>...</b>
           apt-cache's madison command attempts to mimic the output format and a subset of the functionality of
           the Debian archive management tool, madison. It displays available versions of a package in a tabular
           format. Unlike the original madison, it can only display information for the architecture for which
           APT has retrieved package lists (APT::Architecture).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the descriptions indicate the
       configuration option to set. For boolean options you can override the config file by using something like
       <b>-f-</b>,<b>--no-f</b>, <b>-f=no</b> or several other variations.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pkg-cache</b>
           Select the file to store the package cache. The package cache is the primary cache used by all
           operations. Configuration Item: Dir::Cache::pkgcache.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--src-cache</b>
           Select the file to store the source cache. The source is used only by gencaches and it stores a
           parsed version of the package information from remote sources. When building the package cache the
           source cache is used to avoid reparsing all of the package files. Configuration Item:
           Dir::Cache::srcpkgcache.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Quiet; produces output suitable for logging, omitting progress indicators. More q's will produce more
           quietness up to a maximum of 2. You can also use <b>-q=#</b> to set the quietness level, overriding the
           configuration file. Configuration Item: quiet.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--important</b>
           Print only important dependencies; for use with unmet and depends. Causes only Depends and
           Pre-Depends relations to be printed. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::Important.

       <b>--no-pre-depends</b>, <b>--no-depends</b>, <b>--no-recommends</b>, <b>--no-suggests</b>, <b>--no-conflicts</b>, <b>--no-breaks</b>,
       <b>--no-replaces</b>, <b>--no-enhances</b>
           Per default the <b>depends</b> and <b>rdepends</b> print all dependencies. This can be tweaked with these flags
           which will omit the specified dependency type. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::Show<u>DependencyType</u>
           e.g.  APT::Cache::ShowRecommends.

       <b>--implicit</b>
           Per default <b>depends</b> and <b>rdepends</b> print only dependencies explicitly expressed in the metadata. With
           this flag it will also show dependencies implicitly added based on the encountered data. A Conflicts:
           foo e.g. expresses implicitly that this package also conflicts with the package foo from any other
           architecture. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::ShowImplicit.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--full</b>
           Print full package records when searching. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::ShowFull.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all-versions</b>
           Print full records for all available versions. This is the default; to turn it off, use
           <b>--no-all-versions</b>. If <b>--no-all-versions</b> is specified, only the candidate version will be displayed
           (the one which would be selected for installation). This option is only applicable to the show
           command. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::AllVersions.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--generate</b>
           Perform automatic package cache regeneration, rather than use the cache as it is. This is the
           default; to turn it off, use <b>--no-generate</b>. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::Generate.

       <b>--names-only</b>, <b>-n</b>
           Only search on the package and provided package names, not the long descriptions. Configuration Item:
           APT::Cache::NamesOnly.

       <b>--all-names</b>
           Make pkgnames print all names, including virtual packages and missing dependencies. Configuration
           Item: APT::Cache::AllNames.

       <b>--recurse</b>
           Make depends and rdepends recursive so that all packages mentioned are printed once. Configuration
           Item: APT::Cache::RecurseDepends.

       <b>--installed</b>
           Limit the output of depends and rdepends to packages which are currently installed. Configuration
           Item: APT::Cache::Installed.

       <b>--with-source</b> <u>filename</u>
           Adds the given file as a source for metadata. Can be repeated to add multiple files. Supported are
           currently *.deb, *.dsc, *.changes, Sources and Packages files as well as source package directories.
           Files are matched based on their name only, not their content!

           Sources and Packages can be compressed in any format apt supports as long as they have the correct
           extension. If you need to store multiple of these files in one directory you can prefix a name of
           your choice with the last character being an underscore ("_"). Example: my.example_Packages.xz

           Note that these sources are treated as trusted (see <b><a href="../man8/apt-secure.8.html">apt-secure</a></b>(8)). Configuration Item:
           APT::Sources::With.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show a short usage summary.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Show the program version.

       <b>--audit</b>
           Show audit (and notice) messages. This overrides the quiet option, but only for notice messages, not
           progress ones.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--config-file</b>
           Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use. The program will read the default
           configuration file and then this configuration file. If configuration settings need to be set before
           the default configuration files are parsed specify a file with the <b>APT_CONFIG</b> environment variable.
           See <b><a href="../man5/apt.conf.5.html">apt.conf</a></b>(5) for syntax information.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--option</b>
           Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration option. The syntax is <b>-o</b>
           <b>Foo::Bar=bar</b>.  <b>-o</b> and <b>--option</b> can be used multiple times to set different options.

       <b>--no-color</b>, <b>--color</b>
           Turn colors on or off. Colors are on by default on supported terminals for <b><a href="../man8/apt.8.html">apt</a></b>(8) and can also be
           disabled using the <b>NO_COLOR</b> or <b>APT_NO_COLOR</b> environment variables, or further configured by the
           <b>APT::Color</b> configuration option and scope, see <b><a href="../man5/apt.conf.5.html">apt.conf</a></b>(5) for information on that.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
