</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dnscache - a DNS cache.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a reference page.  For tutorial information, see the instructions for
       <b>workstations</b> (<a href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/run-cache.html">http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/run-cache.html</a>),

       <b>external</b> <b>caches</b> (<a href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/run-cache-x.html">http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/run-cache-x.html</a>), or
       <b>upgrading</b> <b>from</b> <b>BIND</b> (<a href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/run-cache-bind-1.html">http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/run-cache-bind-1.html</a>).

       <b>dnscache</b>  accepts recursive DNS queries from local clients such as web browsers and mail transfer agents.
       It collects responses from remote DNS servers.  It caches the responses to save time later.

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b></h4><pre>
       Normally <b>dnscache</b> is set up by the <b><a href="../man8/dnscache-conf.8.html">dnscache-conf</a></b>(8) program.

       <b>dnscache</b> runs chrooted in the directory specified by the <u>$ROOT</u> environment variable, under  the  uid  and
       gid specified by the <u>$UID</u> and <u>$GID</u> environment variables.

       <b>dnscache</b> listens for incoming UDP packets and TCP connections addressed to port 53 of <u>$IP</u>.  Typically <u>$IP</u>
       is <u>127.0.0.1</u>, but it can also be an externally accessible IP address.

       <b>dnscache</b>  accepts  a  packet  or connection from IP address <u>1.2.3.4</u> if it sees a file named <u>ip/1.2.3.4</u> or
       <u>ip/1.2.3</u> or <u>ip/1.2</u> or <u>ip/1</u>.

       <b>dnscache</b> sends outgoing packets from high ports of <u>$IPSEND</u>.  Typically <u>$IPSEND</u> is  <u>0.0.0.0</u>,  meaning  the
       machine's primary IP address.

       <b>dnscache</b> reads a seed, up to 128 bytes, from standard input, and passes the seed to dns_random_init.

       <b>dnscache</b>  reads  a list of dotted-decimal root server IP addresses, one address per line, from <u>servers/@</u>.
       It also scans the <u>servers</u> directory for server IP addresses for other domains.  If  there  are  addresses
       listed  in  <u>servers/moon.af.mil</u>, for example, then <b>dnscache</b> will send queries for <u>anything.moon.af.mil</u> to
       those addresses, and will not cache records for <u>anything.moon.af.mil</u> from outside  servers  such  as  the
       root servers.

       Versions  1.03 and above: If <u>$FORWARDONLY</u> is set, <b>dnscache</b> treats <u>servers/@</u> as a list of IP addresses for
       other caches, not root servers.  It forwards queries to those caches the same way  that  a  client  does,
       rather than contacting a chain of servers according to NS records.

</pre><h4><b>Memory</b> <b>use</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dnscache</b>  uses  a  fixed-size table, under 256K, to keep track of as many as 200 simultaneous UDP queries
       and 20 simultaneous TCP connections.  It also dynamically allocates memory, usually just a few bytes  but
       occasionally  much  more,  for each active query.  If it runs out of memory handling a query, it discards
       that query.

       <b>dnscache</b> asks the operating system to reserve a 128K buffer for  bursts  of  incoming  UDP  queries.   In
       versions  1.03  and  above, if a new UDP query arrives when <b>dnscache</b> is already handling 200 simultaneous
       UDP queries, <b>dnscache</b> drops the oldest query.  If a new TCP connection arrives when <b>dnscache</b>  is  already
       handling 20 simultaneous TCP connections, <b>dnscache</b> drops the oldest connection.

       <b>dnscache</b>  uses  a  fixed-size cache, as controlled by the <u>$CACHESIZE</u> environment variable.  Roughly 5% of
       the cache is used for a hash table.  The rest is used for cache entries (including 8-byte Y2038-compliant
       expiration times):

       o      A sets.  22 bytes plus 4 bytes per address plus the length of the owner name.

       o      NS sets or PTR sets or CNAME sets.  22 bytes plus the length of the owner name and  all  the  data
              names.

       o      MX sets.  22 bytes plus 2 bytes per MX plus the length of all the names.

       o      Other  record sets.  22 bytes plus 2 bytes per record plus the length of all the data strings plus
              the length of the owner name.

       o      Nonexistent domain or server failure.  22 bytes plus the length of the owner name.

       Sets larger than 8192 bytes are not cached.

       <b>dnscache</b> does not exit when it runs out of space in its cache; it simply removes the  oldest  entries  to
       make more space.

</pre><h4><b>Resolution</b> <b>and</b> <b>caching</b> <b>policies</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dnscache</b> relies on a configured list of root name servers.  In contrast, BIND starts from a ``hint file''
       listing name servers, and asks those name servers where the root name servers are.

       <b>dnscache</b>  does  not  cache (or pass along) records outside the server's bailiwick; those records could be
       poisoned.  Records for <u>foo.dom</u>, for example, are accepted only from the root servers,  the  <u>dom</u>  servers,
       and the <u>foo.dom</u> servers.

       <b>dnscache</b>  does  not  bypass  its  cache  to  obtain  glue  from the additional section of a response.  In
       particular, it will not use glue outside the server's bailiwick,  or  glue  with  TTL  0,  or  glue  that
       violates other caching policies.

       <b>dnscache</b> caches records for at most a week.  It interprets TTLs above 2147483647 as 0.

       <b>dnscache</b>  does  not  cache SOA records.  However, it does use SOA TTLs to determine cache times (up to an
       hour) for zero-record responses and nonexistent domains.

</pre><h4><b>Responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>DNS</b> <b>clients</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dnscache</b>'s responses are generally much smaller than BIND's responses.  They  do  not  include  authority
       records  (NS  records  of  the  source  name  servers and SOA records for negative answers) or additional
       records (A records relevant to NS or MX records).  When the answer section is  truncated  by  UDP  length
       limits, it is eliminated entirely.

       <b>dnscache</b>  tries  to  prevent  local  users from snooping on other local users.  It discards non-recursive
       queries; it discards inverse queries; and it  discards  zone-transfer  requests.   If  <u>$HIDETTL</u>  is  set,
       <b>dnscache</b> always uses a TTL of 0 in its responses.  In versions before 1.03, <b>dnscache</b> always uses a TTL of
       0 in its responses.

       According  to  RFC  1035,  the AA bit ``specifies that the responding name server is an authority for the
       domain name in question section.''

       <b>dnscache</b> is not an authority for any domain names.

       <b>dnscache</b> never sets the AA bit (except in NXDOMAIN responses, as required by RFC 2308, to work  around  a
       common  client  bug).   In  contrast,  BIND  often  sets AA for positive responses even when it is not an
       authority for the domain name.  (This appears to have been fixed in BIND 9.)

</pre><h4><b>Repeated</b> <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b></h4><pre>
       If a server sends <b>dnscache</b> a repeated IP address, <b>dnscache</b> passes the repeated IP address  along  to  the
       client.   The server's behavior violates RFC 2181, section 5.5, but there are reasonable uses of repeated
       IP addresses for load balancing, so <b>dnscache</b> does not go out of its way to remove repetitions  when  they
       occur.

       A  widespread  BIND  server  bug  (apparently  fixed in BIND 9.1) can unintentionally produce repeated IP
       addresses.  Here is an example from one of the BIND company's servers (now fixed):

         % dnsq a ns-ext.vix.com ns-ext.vix.com
         1 ns-ext.vix.com:
         117 bytes, 1+1+2+2 records, response, authoritative, noerror
         query: 1 ns-ext.vix.com
         answer: ns-ext.vix.com 3600 A 204.152.184.64
         authority: vix.com 3600 NS ns-ext.vix.com
         authority: vix.com 3600 NS ns1.gnac.com
         additional: ns-ext.vix.com 3600 A 204.152.184.64
         additional: ns1.gnac.com 130768 A 209.182.195.77

       This BIND bug is the most common reason for users to see repeated IP addresses from <b>dnscache</b>.

</pre><h4><b>Special</b> <b>names</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dnscache</b> handles <u>localhost</u> internally, giving it an A record of 127.0.0.1.

       <b>dnscache</b> handles <u>1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa</u> internally, giving it a PTR record of <u>localhost</u>.

       <b>dnscache</b> handles dotted-decimal domain names internally, giving (e.g.) the domain name <u>192.48.96.2</u>  an  A
       record of <u>192.48.96.2</u>.
