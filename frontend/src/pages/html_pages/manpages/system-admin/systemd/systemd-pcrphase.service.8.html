</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       systemd-pcrphase.service, systemd-pcrphase-sysinit.service, and systemd-pcrphase-initrd.service are
       system services that measure specific strings into TPM2 PCR 11 during boot at various milestones of the
       boot process.

       systemd-pcrmachine.service is a system service that measures the machine ID (see <b><a href="../man5/machine-id.5.html">machine-id</a></b>(5)) into PCR
       15.

       systemd-pcrfs-root.service and systemd-pcrfs@.service are services that measure file system identity
       information (i.e. mount point, file system type, label and UUID, partition label and UUID) into PCR 15.
       systemd-pcrfs-root.service does so for the root file system, systemd-pcrfs@.service is a template unit
       that measures the file system indicated by its instance identifier instead.

       These services require <b><a href="../man7/systemd-stub.7.html">systemd-stub</a></b>(7) to be used in a unified kernel image (UKI). They execute no
       operation when the stub has not been used to invoke the kernel. The stub will measure the invoked kernel
       and associated vendor resources into PCR 11 before handing control to it; once userspace is invoked these
       services then will extend TPM2 PCR 11 with certain literal strings indicating phases of the boot process.
       During a regular boot process PCR 11 is extended with the following strings:

        1. "enter-initrd" — early when the initrd initializes, before activating system extension images for the
           initrd. It acts as a barrier between the time where the kernel initializes and where the initrd
           starts operating and enables system extension images, i.e. code shipped outside of the UKI. (This
           extension happens when the <b><a href="../man8/systemd-pcrphase-initrd.service.8.html">systemd-pcrphase-initrd.service</a></b>(8) service is started.)

        2. "leave-initrd" — when the initrd is about to transition into the host file system. It acts as barrier
           between initrd code and host OS code. (This extension happens when the <b><a href="../man8/systemd-pcrphasesysinit.service.8.html">systemd-pcrphase-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man8/systemd-pcrphasesysinit.service.8.html">sysinit.service</a></b>(8) service is stopped.)

        3. "sysinit" — when basic system initialization is complete (which includes local file systems having
           been mounted), and the system begins starting regular system services. (This extension happens when
           the <b><a href="../man8/systemd-pcrphase-sysinit.service.8.html">systemd-pcrphase-sysinit.service</a></b>(8) service is started.)

        4. "ready" — during later boot-up, after remote file systems have been activated (i.e. after
           remote-fs.target), but before users are permitted to log in (i.e. before
           systemd-user-sessions.service). It acts as barrier between the time where unprivileged regular users
           are still prohibited to log in and where they are allowed to log in. (This extension happens when the
           <b><a href="../man8/systemd-pcrphase-sysinit.service.8.html">systemd-pcrphase-sysinit.service</a></b>(8) service is started.)

        5. "shutdown" — when the system shutdown begins. It acts as barrier between the time the system is fully
           up and running and where it is about to shut down. (This extension happens when the
           systemd-pcrphase.service service is stopped.)

        6. "final" — at the end of system shutdown. It acts as barrier between the time the service manager
           still runs and when it transitions into the final shutdown phase where service management is not
           available anymore. (This extension happens when the <b><a href="../man8/systemd-pcrphase-sysinit.service.8.html">systemd-pcrphase-sysinit.service</a></b>(8) service is
           stopped.)

       During a regular system lifecycle, PCR 11 is extended with the strings "enter-initrd", "leave-initrd",
       "sysinit", "ready", "shutdown", and "final".

       Specific phases of the boot process may be referenced via the series of strings measured, separated by
       colons (the "phase path"). For example, the phase path for the regular system runtime is
       "enter-initrd:leave-initrd:sysinit:ready", while the one for the initrd is just "enter-initrd". The phase
       path for the boot phase before the initrd is an empty string; because that's hard to pass around a single
       colon (":") may be used instead. Note that the aforementioned six strings are just the default strings
       and individual systems might measure other strings at other times, and thus implement different and more
       fine-grained boot phases to bind policy to.

       By binding policy of TPM2 objects to a specific phase path it is possible to restrict access to them to
       specific phases of the boot process, for example making it impossible to access the root file system's
       encryption key after the system transitioned from the initrd into the host root file system.

       Use <b><a href="../man1/systemd-measure.1.html">systemd-measure</a></b>(1) to pre-calculate expected PCR 11 values for specific boot phases (via the <b>--phase=</b>
       switch).

       systemd-pcrfs-root.service and systemd-pcrfs@.service are automatically pulled into the initial
       transaction by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-gpt-auto-generator.8.html">systemd-gpt-auto-generator</a></b>(8) for the root and <a href="file:/var/">/var/</a> file systems.  <b><a href="../man8/systemd-fstabgenerator.8.html">systemd-fstab-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man8/systemd-fstabgenerator.8.html">generator</a></b>(8) will do this for all mounts with the <b>x-systemd.pcrfs</b> mount option in /etc/fstab.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The /usr/lib/systemd/system-pcrextend executable may also be invoked from the command line, where it
       expects the word to extend into PCR 11, as well as the following switches:

       <b>--bank=</b>
           Takes the PCR banks to extend the specified word into. If not specified, the tool automatically
           determines all enabled PCR banks and measures the word into all of them.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--pcr=</b>
           Takes the index of the PCR to extend. If <b>--machine-id</b> or <b>--file-system=</b> are specified defaults to 15,
           otherwise defaults to 11.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>--tpm2-device=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Controls which TPM2 device to use. Expects a device node path referring to the TPM2 chip (e.g.
           /dev/tpmrm0). Alternatively the special value "auto" may be specified, in order to automatically
           determine the device node of a suitable TPM2 device (of which there must be exactly one). The special
           value "list" may be used to enumerate all suitable TPM2 devices currently discovered.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--graceful</b>
           If no TPM2 firmware, kernel subsystem, kernel driver or device support is found, exit with exit
           status 0 (i.e. indicate success). If this is not specified, any attempt to measure without a TPM2
           device will cause the invocation to fail.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>--machine-id</b>
           Instead of measuring a word specified on the command line into PCR 11, measure the host's machine ID
           into PCR 15.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>--file-system=</b>
           Instead of measuring a word specified on the command line into PCR 11, measure identity information
           of the specified file system into PCR 15. The parameter must be the path to the established mount
           point of the file system to measure.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /run/log/systemd/tpm2-measure.log
           Measurements are logged into an event log file maintained in /run/log/systemd/tpm2-measure.log, which
           contains a <b>JSON-SEQ</b>[1] series of objects that follow the general structure of the <b>TCG</b> <b>Canonical</b> <b>Event</b>
           <b>Log</b> <b>Format</b> <b>(CEL-JSON)</b>[2] event objects (but lack the "recnum" field).

           A <b>LOCK_EX</b> BSD file lock (<b><a href="../man2/flock.2.html">flock</a></b>(2)) on the log file is acquired while the measurement is made and the
           file is updated. Thus, applications that intend to acquire a consistent quote from the TPM with the
           associated snapshot of the event log should acquire a <b>LOCK_SH</b> lock while doing so.

           Added in version 252.
