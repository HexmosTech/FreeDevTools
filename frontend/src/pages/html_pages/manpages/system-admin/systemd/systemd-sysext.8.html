       systemd-sysext, systemd-sysext.service, systemd-confext, systemd-confext.service - Activates System
       Extension Images

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>systemd-sysext</b> [OPTIONS...] COMMAND

       systemd-sysext.service

       <b>systemd-confext</b> [OPTIONS...] COMMAND

       systemd-confext.service

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>systemd-sysext</b> activates/deactivates system extension images. System extension images may – dynamically
       at runtime — extend the <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a> directory hierarchies with additional files. This is particularly
       useful on immutable system images where a <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and/or <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a> hierarchy residing on a read-only file
       system shall be extended temporarily at runtime without making any persistent modifications.

       System extension images should contain files and directories similar in fashion to regular operating
       system tree. When one or more system extension images are activated, their <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a> hierarchies
       are combined via "overlayfs" with the same hierarchies of the host OS, and the host <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a>
       overmounted with it ("merging"). When they are deactivated, the mount point is disassembled — again
       revealing the unmodified original host version of the hierarchy ("unmerging"). Merging thus makes the
       extension's resources suddenly appear below the <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a> hierarchies as if they were included in
       the base OS image itself. Unmerging makes them disappear again, leaving in place only the files that were
       shipped with the base OS image itself.

       Files and directories contained in the extension images outside of the <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a> hierarchies are
       <u>not</u> merged, and hence have no effect when included in a system extension image. In particular, files in
       the <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> and <a href="file:/var/">/var/</a> included in a system extension image will <u>not</u> appear in the respective hierarchies
       after activation.

       System extension images are strictly read-only by default. On mutable host file systems, <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a>
       hierarchies become read-only while extensions are merged, unless mutability is enabled. Mutability may be
       enabled via the <b>--mutable=</b> option; see "Mutability" below for more information.

       System extensions are supposed to be purely additive, i.e. they are supposed to include only files that
       do not exist in the underlying basic OS image. However, the underlying mechanism (overlayfs) also allows
       overlaying or removing files, but it is recommended not to make use of this.

       System extension images may be provided in the following formats:

        1. Plain directories or btrfs subvolumes containing the OS tree

        2. Disk images with a GPT disk label, following the <b>Discoverable</b> <b>Partitions</b> <b>Specification</b>[1]

        3. Disk images lacking a partition table, with a naked Linux file system (e.g. erofs, squashfs or ext4)

       These image formats are the same ones that <b><a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn</a></b>(1) supports via its <b>--directory=</b>/<b>--image=</b>
       switches and those that the service manager supports via <b>RootDirectory=</b>/<b>RootImage=</b>. Similar to them they
       may optionally carry Verity authentication information.

       System extensions are searched for in the directories /etc/extensions/, /run/extensions/ and
       /var/lib/extensions/. The first two listed directories are not suitable for carrying large binary images,
       however are still useful for carrying symlinks to them. The primary place for installing system
       extensions is /var/lib/extensions/. Any directories found in these search directories are considered
       directory based extension images; any files with the .raw suffix are considered disk image based
       extension images. When invoked in the initrd, the additional directory /.extra/sysext/ is included in the
       directories that are searched for extension images. Note however, that by default a tighter image policy
       applies to images found there, though, see below. This directory is populated by <b><a href="../man7/systemd-stub.7.html">systemd-stub</a></b>(7) with
       extension images found in the system's EFI System Partition.

       During boot OS extension images are activated automatically, if the systemd-sysext.service is enabled.
       Note that this service runs only after the underlying file systems where system extensions may be located
       have been mounted. This means they are not suitable for shipping resources that are processed by
       subsystems running in earliest boot. Specifically, OS extension images are not suitable for shipping
       system services or <b><a href="../man8/systemd-sysusers.8.html">systemd-sysusers</a></b>(8) definitions. See the <b>Portable</b> <b>Services</b>[2] page for a simple
       mechanism for shipping system services in disk images, in a similar fashion to OS extensions. Note the
       different isolation on these two mechanisms: while system extension directly extend the underlying OS
       image with additional files that appear in a way very similar to as if they were shipped in the OS image
       itself and thus imply no security isolation, portable services imply service level sandboxing in one way
       or another. The systemd-sysext.service service is guaranteed to finish start-up before basic.target is
       reached; i.e. at the time regular services initialize (those which do not use <u>DefaultDependencies=no</u>),
       the files and directories system extensions provide are available in <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a> and may be accessed.

       Note that there is no concept of enabling/disabling installed system extension images: all installed
       extension images are automatically activated at boot. However, you can place an empty directory named
       like the extension (no .raw) in /etc/extensions/ to "mask" an extension with the same name in a system
       folder with lower precedence.

       A simple mechanism for version compatibility is enforced: a system extension image must carry a
       /usr/lib/extension-release.d/extension-release.<u>NAME</u> file, which must match its image name, that is
       compared with the host os-release file: the contained <u>ID=</u> fields have to match unless "_any" is set for
       the extension. If the extension <u>ID=</u> is not "_any", the <u>SYSEXT_LEVEL=</u> field (if defined) has to match. If
       the latter is not defined, the <u>VERSION_ID=</u> field has to match instead. If the extension defines the
       <u>ARCHITECTURE=</u> field and the value is not "_any" it has to match the kernel's architecture reported by
       <b><a href="../man2/uname.2.html">uname</a></b>(2) but the used architecture identifiers are the same as for <u>ConditionArchitecture=</u> described in
       <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5).  <u>EXTENSION_RELOAD_MANAGER=</u> can be set to 1 if the extension requires a service manager
       reload after application of the extension. Note that for the reasons mentioned earlier, <b>Portable</b>
       <b>Services</b>[2] remain the recommended way to ship system services. System extensions should not ship a
       <a href="file:/usr/lib/os-release">/usr/lib/os-release</a> file (as that would be merged into the host <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> tree, overriding the host OS
       version data, which is not desirable). The extension-release file follows the same format and semantics,
       and carries the same content, as the os-release file of the OS, but it describes the resources carried in
       the extension image.

       The <b>systemd-confext</b> concept follows the same principle as the <b><a href="../man8/systemd-sysext.8.html">systemd-sysext</a></b>(8) functionality but instead
       of working on <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> and <a href="file:/opt">/opt</a>, <b>confext</b> will extend only /etc. Files and directories contained in the
       confext images outside of the <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> hierarchy are <u>not</u> merged, and hence have no effect when included in
       the image. Formats for these images are of the same as sysext images. The merged hierarchy will be
       mounted with "nosuid" and (if not disabled via <b>--noexec=false</b>) "noexec".

       Just like sysexts, confexts are strictly read-only by default. Merging confexts on mutable host file
       systems will result in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> becoming read-only. As with sysexts, mutability can be enabled via the
       <b>--mutable=</b> option. Refer to "Mutability" below for more information.

       Confexts are looked for in the directories /run/confexts/, /var/lib/confexts/, /usr/lib/confexts/ and
       /usr/local/lib/confexts/. The first listed directory is not suitable for carrying large binary images,
       however is still useful for carrying symlinks to them. The primary place for installing configuration
       extensions is /var/lib/confexts/. Any directories found in these search directories are considered
       directory based confext images; any files with the .raw suffix are considered disk image based confext
       images.

       Again, just like sysext images, the confext images will contain a
       /etc/extension-release.d/extension-release.<u>NAME</u> file, which must match the image name (with the usual
       escape hatch of the <u>user.extension-release.strict</u> <b><a href="../man7/xattr.7.html">xattr</a></b>(7)), and again with content being one or more of
       <u>ID=</u>, <u>VERSION_ID=</u>, and <u>CONFEXT_LEVEL</u>. Confext images will then be checked and matched against the base OS
       layer.

</pre><h4><b>USES</b></h4><pre>
       The primary use case for system images are immutable environments where debugging and development tools
       shall optionally be made available, but not included in the immutable base OS image itself (e.g.
       <b><a href="../man1/strace.1.html">strace</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/gdb.1.html">gdb</a></b>(1) shall be an optionally installable addition in order to make debugging/development
       easier). System extension images should not be misunderstood as a generic software packaging framework,
       as no dependency scheme is available: system extensions should carry all files they need themselves,
       except for those already shipped in the underlying host system image. Typically, system extension images
       are built at the same time as the base OS image — within the same build system.

       Another use case for the system extension concept is temporarily overriding OS supplied resources with
       newer ones, for example to install a locally compiled development version of some low-level component
       over the immutable OS image without doing a full OS rebuild or modifying the nominally immutable image.
       (e.g. "install" a locally built package with <b>DESTDIR=/var/lib/extensions/mytest</b> <b>make</b> <b>install</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b>
       <b>systemd-sysext</b> <b>refresh</b>, making it available in <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> as if it was installed in the OS image itself.) This
       case works regardless if the underlying host <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> is managed as immutable disk image or is a traditional
       package manager controlled (i.e. writable) tree.

       With <b>systemd-confext</b> one can perform runtime reconfiguration of OS services. Sometimes, there is a need
       to swap certain configuration parameter values or restart only a specific service without deployment of
       new code or a complete OS deployment. In other words, we want to be able to tie the most frequently
       configured options to runtime updateable flags that can be changed without a system reboot. This will
       help reduce servicing times when there is a need for changing the OS configuration. It also provides a
       reliable tool for managing configuration because all old configuration files disappear when the
       <b>systemd-confext</b> image is removed.

</pre><h4><b>MUTABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       By default, merging system extensions on mutable host file systems will render <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a>
       hierarchies read-only. Merging configuration extensions will have the same effect on <a href="file:/etc/.">/etc/.</a> Mutable mode
       allows writes to these locations when extensions are merged.

       The following modes are supported:

        1. <b>disabled</b>: Force immutable mode even if write routing directories exist below
           /var/lib/extensions.mutable/. This is the default.

        2. <b>auto</b>: Automatic mode. Mutability is disabled by default and only enabled if a corresponding write
           routing directory exists below /var/lib/extensions.mutable/.

        3. <b>enabled</b>: Force mutable mode and automatically create write routing directories below
           /var/lib/extensions.mutable/ when required.

        4. <b>import</b>: Force immutable mode like <b>disabled</b> above, but merge the contents of directories below
           /var/lib/extensions.mutable/ into the host file system.

        5. <b>ephemeral</b>: Force mutable mode like <b>enabled</b> above, but instead of using write routing directory below
           /var/lib/extensions.mutable/, <b>systemd-sysext</b> will use empty ephemeral directories. This means that
           the modifications made in the merged hierarchies will be gone when the hierarchies are unmerged.

        6. <b>ephemeral-import</b>: Force mutable mode like <b>ephemeral</b> above, but instead of ignoring the contents of
           write routing directories under /var/lib/extensions.mutable/, merge them into the host file system,
           like <b>import</b> does.

       See "Options" below on specifying modes using the <b>--mutable=</b> command line option.

       With exception of the ephemeral mode, the mutable mode routes writes to subdirectories in
       /var/lib/extensions.mutable/.
           Writes to <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> are directed to /var/lib/extensions.mutable/usr/
           writes to <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a> are directed to /var/lib/extensions.mutable/opt/, and
           writes to <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> land in /var/lib/extensions.mutable/etc/.

       If usr/, opt/, or etc/ in /var/lib/extensions.mutable/ are symlinks, then writes are directed to the
       symlinks' targets. Consequently, to retain mutability of a host file system, create symlinks
           /var/lib/extensions.mutable/etc/ → <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>
           /var/lib/extensions.mutable/usr/ → <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>
           /var/lib/extensions.mutable/opt/ → <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a>
       to route writes back to the original base directory hierarchy.

       Alternatively, a temporary file system may be mounted to /var/lib/extensions.mutable/, or symlinks in
       /var/lib/extensions.mutable/ may point to sub-directories on a temporary file system (e.g. below <a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>)
       to only allow ephemeral changes. Note that this is not the same as ephemeral mode, because the temporary
       file system will still exist after unmerging.

       Added in version 256.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following commands are understood by both the sysext and confext concepts:

       <b>status</b>
           When invoked without any command verb, or when <b>status</b> is specified the current merge status is shown,
           separately (for both <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a> of sysext and for <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> of confext).

           Added in version 248.

       <b>merge</b>
           Merges all currently installed system extension images into <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a>, by overmounting these
           hierarchies with an "overlayfs" file system combining the underlying hierarchies with those included
           in the extension images. This command will fail if the hierarchies are already merged. For confext,
           the merge happens into the <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> directory instead.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>unmerge</b>
           Unmerges all currently installed system extension images from <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a> for sysext and <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>,
           for confext, by unmounting the "overlayfs" file systems created by <b>merge</b> prior.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>refresh</b>
           A combination of <b>unmerge</b> and <b>merge</b>: if already mounted the existing "overlayfs" instance is unmounted
           temporarily, and then replaced by a new version. This command is useful after installing/removing
           system extension images, in order to update the "overlayfs" file system accordingly. If no system
           extensions are installed when this command is executed, the equivalent of <b>unmerge</b> is executed,
           without establishing any new "overlayfs" instance. Note that currently there's a brief moment where
           neither the old nor the new "overlayfs" file system is mounted. This implies that all resources
           supplied by a system extension will briefly disappear — even if it exists continuously during the
           refresh operation.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>list</b>
           A brief list of installed extension images is shown.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--root=</b>
           Operate relative to the specified root directory, i.e. establish the "overlayfs" mount not on the
           top-level host <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a> hierarchies for sysext or <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> for confext, but below some specified
           root directory.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--force</b>
           When merging system extensions into <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a> for sysext and <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> for confext, ignore version
           incompatibilities, i.e. force merging regardless of whether the version information included in the
           images matches the host or not.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--image-policy=</b><u>policy</u>
           Takes an image policy string as argument, as per <b><a href="../man7/systemd.image-policy.7.html">systemd.image-policy</a></b>(7). The policy is enforced when
           operating on system extension disk images. If not specified, defaults to
           "root=verity+signed+encrypted+unprotected+absent:usr=verity+signed+encrypted+unprotected+absent" for
           system extensions, i.e. only the root and <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> file systems in the image are used. For configuration
           extensions defaults to "root=verity+signed+encrypted+unprotected+absent". When run in the initrd and
           operating on a system extension image stored in the /.extra/sysext/ directory a slightly stricter
           policy is used by default: "root=signed+absent:usr=signed+absent", see above for details.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>--mutable=</b><u>BOOL</u><b>|</b><u>auto</u><b>|</b><u>import</u>
           Set mutable mode.

           <b>no</b>
               force immutable mode even with write routing directories present. This is the default.

               Added in version 256.

           <b>auto</b>
               enable mutable mode individually for <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>, <a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a>, and <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> if write routing sub-directories or
               symlinks are present in /var/lib/extensions.mutable/; disable otherwise. See "Mutability" above
               for more information on write routing.

               Added in version 256.

           <b>yes</b>
               force mutable mode. Write routing directories will be created in /var/lib/extensions.mutable/ if
               not present.

               Added in version 256.

           <b>import</b>
               immutable mode, but with contents of write routing directories in /var/lib/extensions.mutable/
               also merged into the host file system.

               Added in version 256.

           <b>ephemeral</b>
               force mutable mode, but with contents of write routing directories in
               /var/lib/extensions.mutable/ being ignored, and modifications of the host file system being
               discarded after unmerge.

               Added in version 256.

           <b>ephemeral-import</b>
               force mutable mode, with contents of write routing directories in /var/lib/extensions.mutable/
               being merged into the host file system, but with the modifications made to the host file system
               being discarded after unmerge.

               Added in version 256.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--noexec=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           When merging configuration extensions into <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> the "MS_NOEXEC" mount flag is used by default. This
           option can be used to disable it.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>--no-reload</b>
           When used with <b>merge</b>, <b>unmerge</b> or <b>refresh</b>, do not reload daemon after executing the changes even if an
           extension that is applied requires a reload via the <u>EXTENSION_RELOAD_MANAGER=</u> set to 1.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>--no-legend</b>
           Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with hints.

       <b>--json=</b><u>MODE</u>
           Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for the shortest possible output without any
           redundant whitespace or line breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same, with indentation
           and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON output, the default).
