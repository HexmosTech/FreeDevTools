       systemd-udevd.service, systemd-udevd-control.socket, systemd-udevd-kernel.socket, systemd-udevd - Device
       event managing daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       systemd-udevd.service

       systemd-udevd-control.socket

       systemd-udevd-kernel.socket

       <b><a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-udevd">/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-udevd</a></b> [<b>--daemon</b>] [<b>--debug</b>] [<b>--children-max=</b>] [<b>--exec-delay=</b>] [<b>--event-timeout=</b>]
                                      [<b>--resolve-names=early|late|never</b>] [<b>--version</b>] [<b>--help</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>systemd-udevd</b> listens to kernel uevents. For every event, systemd-udevd executes matching instructions
       specified in udev rules. See <b><a href="../man7/udev.7.html">udev</a></b>(7).

       The behavior of the daemon can be configured using <b><a href="../man5/udev.conf.5.html">udev.conf</a></b>(5), its command line options, environment
       variables, and on the kernel command line, or changed dynamically with <b>udevadm</b> <b>control</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b>, <b>--daemon</b>
           Detach and run in the background.

           Added in version 186.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--debug</b>
           Print debug messages to standard error.

           Added in version 186.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--children-max=</b>
           Limit the number of events executed in parallel.

           Added in version 186.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--exec-delay=</b>
           Delay the execution of each <u>RUN{program}</u> parameter by the given number of seconds. This option might
           be useful when debugging system crashes during coldplug caused by loading non-working kernel modules.

           Added in version 186.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--event-timeout=</b>
           Set the number of seconds to wait for events to finish. After this time, the event will be
           terminated. The default is 180 seconds.

           Added in version 216.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--timeout-signal=</b>
           Set the signal which systemd-udevd will send to forked off processes after reaching event timeout.
           The setting can be overridden at boot time with the kernel command line option <u>udev.timeout_signal=</u>.
           Setting to <b>SIGABRT</b> may be helpful in order to debug worker timeouts. Defaults to <b>SIGKILL</b>. Note that
           setting the option on the command line overrides the setting from the configuration file.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--resolve-names=</b>
           Specify when systemd-udevd should resolve names of users and groups. When set to <b>early</b> (the default),
           names will be resolved when the rules are parsed. When set to <b>late</b>, names will be resolved for every
           event. When set to <b>never</b>, names will never be resolved and all devices will be owned by root.

           Added in version 186.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

</pre><h4><b>KERNEL</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b></h4><pre>
       Parameters prefixed with "rd." will be read when <b>systemd-udevd</b> is used in an initrd, those without will
       be processed both in the initrd and on the host.

       <u>udev.log_level=</u>, <u>rd.udev.log_level=</u>
           Set the log level.

           Added in version 247.

       <u>udev.children_max=</u>, <u>rd.udev.children_max=</u>
           Limit the number of events executed in parallel.

           Added in version 186.

       <u>udev.exec_delay=</u>, <u>rd.udev.exec_delay=</u>
           Delay the execution of each <u>RUN{program}</u> parameter by the given number of seconds. This option might
           be useful when debugging system crashes during coldplug caused by loading non-working kernel modules.

           Added in version 186.

       <u>udev.event_timeout=</u>, <u>rd.udev.event_timeout=</u>
           Wait for events to finish up to the given number of seconds. This option might be useful if events
           are terminated due to kernel drivers taking too long to initialize.

           Added in version 216.

       <u>udev.timeout_signal=</u>, <u>rd.udev.timeout_signal=</u>
           Specifies a signal that systemd-udevd will send to workers on timeout. Note that kernel command line
           option overrides both the setting in the configuration file and the one on the program command line.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>udev.blockdev_read_only</u>, <u>rd.udev.blockdev_read_only</u>
           If specified, mark all physical block devices read-only as they appear. Synthetic block devices (such
           as loopback block devices or device mapper devices) are left as they are. This is useful to guarantee
           that the contents of physical block devices remains unmodified during runtime, for example to
           implement fully stateless systems, for testing or for recovery situations where corrupted file
           systems shall not be corrupted further through accidental modification.

           A block device may be marked writable again by issuing the <b>blockdev</b> <b>--setrw</b> command, see <b><a href="../man8/blockdev.8.html">blockdev</a></b>(8)
           for details.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>net.ifnames=</u>
           Network interfaces are renamed to give them predictable names when possible. It is enabled by
           default; specifying 0 disables it.

           Added in version 199.

       <u>net.naming_scheme=</u>
           Network interfaces are renamed to give them predictable names when possible (unless <u>net.ifnames=0</u> is
           specified, see above). With this kernel command line option it is possible to pick a specific version
           of this algorithm and override the default chosen at compilation time. Expects one of the naming
           scheme identifiers listed in <b><a href="../man7/systemd.net-naming-scheme.7.html">systemd.net-naming-scheme</a></b>(7), or "latest" to select the latest scheme
           known (to this particular version of systemd-udevd.service).

           Note that selecting a specific scheme is not sufficient to fully stabilize interface naming: the
           naming is generally derived from driver attributes exposed by the kernel. As the kernel is updated,
           previously missing attributes systemd-udevd.service is checking might appear, which affects older
           name derivation algorithms, too.

           Added in version 240.

       <u>net.ifname_policy=policy1[,policy2,...][,MAC]</u>
           Specifies naming policies applied when renaming network interfaces. Takes a list of policies and an
           optional MAC address separated with comma. Each policy value must be one of the policies understood
           by the <u>NamePolicy=</u> setting in .link files, e.g.  "onboard" or "path". See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.link.5.html">systemd.link</a></b>(5) for more
           details. When the MAC address is specified, the policies are applied to the interface which has the
           address. When no MAC address is specified, the policies are applied to all interfaces. This kernel
           command line argument can be specified multiple times.

           This argument is not directly read by <b>systemd-udevd</b>, but is instead converted to a .link file by
           <b><a href="../man8/systemd-network-generator.service.8.html">systemd-network-generator.service</a></b>(8). For this argument to take effect,
           systemd-network-generator.service must be enabled.

           Example:

               net.ifname_policy=keep,kernel,path,slot,onboard,01:23:45:67:89:ab
               net.ifname_policy=keep,kernel,path,slot,onboard,mac

           This is mostly equivalent to creating the following .link files:

               # 91-name-policy-with-mac.link
               [Match]
               MACAddress=01:23:45:67:89:ab

               [Link]
               NamePolicy=keep kernel path slot onboard
               AlternativeNamePolicy=path slot onboard

           and

               # 92-name-policy-for-all.link
               [Match]
               OriginalName=*

               [Link]
               NamePolicy=keep kernel path slot onboard mac
               AlternativeNamePolicy=path slot onboard mac

           Added in version 250.
