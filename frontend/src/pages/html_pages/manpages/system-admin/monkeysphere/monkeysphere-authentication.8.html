</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       monkeysphere-authentication - Monkeysphere authentication admin tool.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>monkeysphere-authentication</b> <u>subcommand</u> <b>[</b><u>args</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Monkeysphere</b>  is  a  framework  to  leverage the OpenPGP Web of Trust (WoT) for key-based authentication.
       OpenPGP keys are tracked via GnuPG, and added to the authorized_keys files used by OpenSSH for connection
       authentication.

       <b>monkeysphere-authentication</b> is a Monkeysphere server admin utility for configuring and managing SSH  user
       authentication through the WoT.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCOMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>monkeysphere-authentication</b> takes various subcommands:

       <b>update-users</b> <b>[USER]...</b>
              Rebuild  the  monkeysphere-controlled authorized_keys files.  For each specified account, the user
              ID's listed in the account's authorized_user_ids file are processed.  For each user ID,  gpg  will
              be  queried  for  keys  associated  with  that  user  ID,  optionally querying a keyserver.  If an
              acceptable key is found (see KEY ACCEPTABILITY in  <a href="../man7/monkeysphere.7.html">monkeysphere</a>(7)),  the  key  is  added  to  the
              account's  monkeysphere-controlled  authorized_keys  file.  If the RAW_AUTHORIZED_KEYS variable is
              set, then a separate authorized_keys file (usually ~USER/.ssh/authorized_keys) is appended to  the
              monkeysphere-controlled  authorized_keys file.  If no accounts are specified, then all accounts on
              the system are processed.  `u' may be used in place of `update-users'.

       <b>keys-for-user</b> <b>USER</b>
              Output to stdout authorized_keys lines for USER.  This command behaves exactly  like  update-users
              (above),  except  that  the resulting authorized_keys lines are output to stdout, instead of being
              written to the monkeysphere-controlled authorized_keys file.

       <b>refresh-keys</b>
              Refresh all keys in the monkeysphere-authentication keyring.  If no accounts are  specified,  then
              all accounts on the system are processed.  `r' may be used in place of `refresh-keys'.

       <b>add-id-certifier</b> <b>KEYID|FILE</b>
              Instruct  system  to  trust user identity certifications made by KEYID.  The key ID will be loaded
              from the keyserver.  A file may be loaded instead  of  pulling  the  key  from  the  keyserver  by
              specifying  the  path to the file as the argument, or by specifying `-' to load from stdin.  Using
              the `-n' or `--domain' option allows you to indicate that you only trust the given KEYID  to  make
              identifications  within a specific domain (e.g. "trust KEYID to certify user identities within the
              @example.org domain").  A certifier trust level can be specified with the `-t' or `--trust' option
              (possible values are `marginal' and `full' (default is `full')).  A certifier trust depth  can  be
              specified  with  the  `-d'  or  `--depth'  option  (default  is  1).  `c+' may be used in place of
              `add-id-certifier'.

       <b>remove-id-certifier</b> <b>KEYID</b>
              Instruct system to ignore user identity certifications made by KEYID.  `c-' may be used  in  place
              of `remove-id-certifier'.

       <b>list-id-certifiers</b>
              List  key  IDs  trusted  by  the  system  to certify user identities.  `c' may be used in place of
              `list-id-certifiers'.

       <b>version</b>
              Show the monkeysphere version number.  `v' may be used in place of `version'.

       <b>help</b>   Output a brief usage summary.  `h' or `?' may be used in place of `help'.

              Other commands:

       <b>setup</b>  Setup the server in preparation for Monkeysphere user authentication.  This command is  idempotent
              and  run  automatically  by  the  other  commands, and should therefore not usually need to be run
              manually.  `s' may be used in place of `setup'.

       <b>diagnostics</b>
              Review the state of the server with respect to authentication.   `d'  may  be  used  in  place  of
              `diagnostics'.

       <b>gpg-cmd</b>
              Execute  a  gpg  command,  as  the  monkeysphere user, on the monkeysphere authentication `sphere'
              keyring.  As of monkeysphere 0.36, this takes its arguments separately, not as  a  single  string.
              Use  this command with caution, as modifying the authentication sphere keyring can affect ssh user
              authentication.

</pre><h4><b>SETUP</b> <b>USER</b> <b>AUTHENTICATION</b></h4><pre>
       If the server will handle user authentication through monkeysphere-generated authorized_keys  files,  the
       server  must  be told which keys will act as identity certifiers.  This is done with the <b>add-id-certifier</b>
       command:

       # monkeysphere-authentication add-id-certifier KEYID

       where KEYID is the key ID of the server admin, or whoever's certifications should be  acceptable  to  the
       system  for  the  purposes  of  authenticating  remote users.  You can run this command multiple times to
       indicate that multiple certifiers are trusted.  You may also specify a filename instead of a key  ID,  as
       long  as  the  file  contains  a  single  OpenPGP  public  key.   Certifiers  can  be  removed  with  the
       <b>remove-id-certifier</b> command, and listed with the <b>list-id-certifiers</b> command.

       A remote user will be granted access to a local account based on the appropriately-signed and valid  keys
       associated   with  user  IDs  listed  in  that  account's  authorized_user_ids  file.   By  default,  the
       authorized_user_ids file for an account is <a href="file:~/.monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids.">~/.monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids.</a>  This can be  changed  in
       the monkeysphere-authentication.conf file.

       The  <b>update-users</b> command is used to generate authorized_keys files for a local account based on the user
       IDs listed in the account's authorized_user_ids file:

       # monkeysphere-authentication update-users USER

       Not specifying USER will cause all accounts on the system to updated.   The  ssh  server  can  use  these
       monkeysphere-generated authorized_keys files to grant access to user accounts for remote users.  In order
       for  sshd  to  look  at  the  monkeysphere-generated  authorized_keys  file  for user authentication, the
       AuthorizedKeysFile parameter must be set in  the  sshd_config  to  point  to  the  monkeysphere-generated
       authorized_keys files:

       AuthorizedKeysFile /var/lib/monkeysphere/authorized_keys/%u

       It  is  recommended  to  add "monkeysphere-authentication update-users" to a system crontab, so that user
       keys are kept up-to-date, and key revocations and expirations can be processed in a timely manner.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables will override  those  specified  in  the  config  file  (defaults  in
       parentheses):

       MONKEYSPHERE_MONKEYSPHERE_USER
              User to control authentication keychain. (monkeysphere)

       MONKEYSPHERE_LOG_LEVEL
              Set  the log level.  Can be SILENT, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, in increasing order of verbosity.
              (INFO)

       MONKEYSPHERE_KEYSERVER
              OpenPGP keyserver to use. (pool.sks-keyservers.net)

       MONKEYSPHERE_CHECK_KEYSERVER
              Whether or not to check the keyserver when making gpg queries. (true)

       MONKEYSPHERE_AUTHORIZED_USER_IDS
              Path to user's authorized_user_ids file. %h gets replaced with the user's  homedir,  %u  with  the
              username.  (%h/.monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids)

       MONKEYSPHERE_RAW_AUTHORIZED_KEYS
              Path   to   regular   ssh-style   authorized_keys   file   to   append  to  monkeysphere-generated
              authorized_keys.  `none' means not to add any raw authorized_keys file.  %h gets replaced with the
              user's homedir, %u with the username. (%h/.ssh/authorized_keys)

       MONKEYSPHERE_PROMPT
              If set to `false', never prompt the user for confirmation. (true)

       MONKEYSPHERE_STRICT_MODES
              If  set  to  `false',  ignore  too-loose  permissions   on   known_hosts,   authorized_keys,   and
              authorized_user_ids  files.   NOTE: setting this to false may expose users to abuse by other users
              on the system. (true)

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/monkeysphere/monkeysphere-authentication.conf
              System monkeysphere-authentication config file.

       /etc/monkeysphere/monkeysphere-authentication-x509-anchors.crt or
       /etc/monkeysphere/monkeysphere-x509-anchors.crt
              If monkeysphere-authentication is configured to query an hkps keyserver,  it  will  use  the  PEM-
              encoded  X.509  Certificate Authority certificates in this file to validate any X.509 certificates
              used by the keyserver. If the monkeysphere-authentication-x509 file is present, the  monkeysphere-
              x509 file will be ignored.

       /var/lib/monkeysphere/authorized_keys/USER
              Monkeysphere-controlled user authorized_keys files.

       <a href="file:~/.monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids">~/.monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids</a>
              A  list  of  OpenPGP  user  IDs,  one  per  line.   OpenPGP  keys with an exactly-matching User ID
              (calculated valid by the designated identity  certifiers),  will  have  any  valid  authorization-
              capable  keys  or  subkeys  added to the given user's authorized_keys file.  Any line with initial
              whitespace will be interpreted as ssh authorized_keys options applicable to the preceding User ID.
