</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tuna - program for tuning running processes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tuna</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  explains  the  <b>tuna</b>  program.  The  program  can  be used to change the attributes of
       application and kernel threads. <b>tuna</b> can operate on IRQs by name or  number,  and  tasks  or  threads  by
       process ID or command-line. CPUs and sets of CPUs can be specified by CPU or socket number. IRQ names and
       process command-lines can include wildcards.

       <b>tuna</b>  can  change  scheduling policy, scheduler priority and processor affinity for processes and process
       threads. <b>tuna</b> can also change the processor affinity for interrupts.  When <b>tuna</b> is  invoked  without  any
       options  it  starts  up  in its graphical interface mode. This manual page explains only the command-line
       options for <b>tuna</b>

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print a list of options. <b>tuna</b> will exit after this action, ignoring the remainder of the  command-
              line.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Show version

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--logging</b>=<u>LOG-LEVEL</u>

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--debug</b>
              Print DEBUG level logging details to console

              CPU-LIST  affected  by  commands. Requires a CPU number, a range, or a comma-separated list of CPU
              numbers.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--sockets</b>=<u>CPU-SOCKET-LIST</u>
              CPU-SOCKET-LIST affected by commands. Requires a socket number or a comma-separated list of socket
              numbers.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--threads</b>=<u>THREAD-LIST</u>
              THREAD-LIST affected by commands. Requires a thread number or thread name,  or  a  comma-separated
              list  of  thread  numbers  and/or  names.  Thread names may contain wildcards. Be sure to quote or
              escape any wildcard specifications.

       <b>USAGE</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b>
              If for instance the Ethernet NICs have multiple queues for both receive and  transmit,  each  with
              its own IRQ, the Ethernet IRQs can be associated with a CPU socket:

       <b>tuna</b> <b>isolate</b> <b>-S</b> <b>2</b>

       <b>tuna</b> <b>spread</b> <b>-q</b> <b>'eth*'</b> <b>-S</b> <b>2</b>

              Move  everything  off  the  CPUs in socket 2, then spread the IRQs for the Ethernet devices across
              those same CPUs.
