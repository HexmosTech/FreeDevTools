</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::ASN1::Sequence - Regular expression-based Perl Parser for ASN.1-formatted NCBI Sequences.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.73

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Bio::ASN1::Sequence;

         my $parser = Bio::ASN1::Sequence-&gt;new('file' =&gt; "downloaded.asn1");
         while(my $result = $parser-&gt;next_seq)
         {
           # extract data from $result, or Dumpvalue-&gt;new-&gt;dumpValue($result);
         }

         # a new way to get the $result data hash for a particular sequence id:
         use Bio::ASN1::Sequence::Indexer;
         my $inx = Bio::ASN1::Sequence::Indexer-&gt;new(-filename =&gt; 'seq.idx');
         my $seq = $inx-&gt;fetch_hash('AF093062');

         # for creation of .idx index files please refer to
         # Bio::ASN1::Sequence::Indexer perldoc

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::ASN1::Sequence is a regular expression-based Perl Parser for ASN.1-formatted NCBI sequences.  It
       parses an ASN.1-formatted sequence record and returns a data structure that contains all data items from
       the sequence record.

       The parser will report error &amp; line number if input data does not conform to the NCBI Sequence annotation
       file format.

       The sequence parser is basically a modified version of the high-performance Bio::ASN1::EntrezGene parser.
       However, I created a standalone module for sequence since it is more efficient to keep Sequence-specific
       code out of EntrezGene.pm.

       In fact it is possible to provide reading of all NCBI's ASN.1-formatted files through simple variations
       of the Entrez Gene parser (I need more investigation to be sure, but at least the sequence parser works
       well).

       Since demand for parsing NCBI ASN.1-formatted sequences is much lower than EntrezGene, this module is
       more like a beta version that works on the examples I checked, but I did not check all available records
       or data definitions.  The error-reporting function of this module has to be useful sometimes. :)

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>maxerrstr</b>
         Parameters: $maxerrstr (optional) - maximum number of characters after
                       offending element, used by error reporting, default is 20
         Example:    $parser-&gt;<a href="../man20/maxerrstr.20.html">maxerrstr</a>(20);
         Function:   get/set maxerrstr.
         Returns:    maxerrstr.
         Notes:

   <b>input_file</b>
         Parameters: $filename for file that contains Sequence record(s)
         Example:    $parser-&gt;input_file($filename);
         Function:   Takes in name of a file containing Sequence records.
                     opens the file and stores file handle
         Returns:    none.
         Notes:      Attempts to open file larger than 2 GB even on Perl that
                       does not support 2 GB file (accomplished by calling
                       "cat" and piping output. On OS that does not have "cat"
                       error message will be displayed)

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         Parameters: maxerrstr =&gt; 20 (optional) - maximum number of characters after
                       offending element, used by error reporting, default is 20
                     file or -file =&gt; $filename (optional) - name of the file to be
                       parsed. call next_seq to parse!
                     fh or -fh =&gt; $filehandle (optional) - handle of the file to be
                       parsed.
         Example:    my $parser = Bio::ASN1::Sequence-&gt;new();
         Function:   Instantiate a parser object
         Returns:    Object reference
         Notes:      Setting file or fh will reset line numbers etc. that are used
                       for error reporting purposes, and seeking on file handle would
                       mess up linenumbers!

   <b>parse</b>
         Parameters: $string that contains Sequence record,
                     $trimopt (optional) that specifies how the data structure
                       returned should be trimmed. 2 is recommended and
                       default
                     $noreset (optional) that species that line number should not
                       be reset
                     DEPRECATED as external function!!! Do not call this function
                       directly!  Call next_seq() instead
         Example:    my $value = $parser-&gt;parse($text); # DEPRECATED as
                       # external function!!! Do not call this function
                       # directly!  Call next_seq() instead
         Function:   Takes in a string representing Sequence record, parses
                       the record and returns a data structure.
         Returns:    A data structure containing all data items from the sequence
                       record.
         Notes:      DEPRECATED as external function!!! Do not call this function
                       directly!  Call next_seq() instead
                     $string should not contain 'Seq-entry ::= set' at beginning!

   <b>next_seq</b>
         Parameters: $trimopt (optional) that specifies how the data structure
                       returned should be trimmed. option 2 is recommended and
                       default
         Example:    my $value = $parser-&gt;next_seq();
         Function:   Use the file handle generated by input_file, parses the next
                       the record and returns a data structure.
         Returns:    A data structure containing all data items from the sequence
                       record.
         Notes:      Must pass in a filename through new() or input_file() first!
                     For details on how to use the $trimopt data trimming option
                       please see comment for the trimdata method. An option
                       of 2 is recommended and default
                     The acceptable values for $trimopt include:
                       1 - trim as much as possible
                       2 (or 0, undef) - trim to an easy-to-use structure
                       3 - no trimming (in version 1.06, prior to version
                           1.06, 0 or undef means no trimming)

   <b>trimdata</b>
         Parameters: $hashref or $arrayref
                     $trimflag (optional, see Notes)
         Example:    trimdata($datahash); # using the default flag
         Function:   recursively process all attributes of a hash/array
                     hybrid and get rid of any arrayref that points to
                     one-element arrays (trims data structure) depending on
                     the optional flag.
         Returns:    none - trimming happenes in-place
         Notes:      This function is useful to compact a data structure produced by
                       Bio::ASN1::Sequence::parse.
                     The acceptable values for $trimopt include:
                       1 - trim as much as possible
                       2 (or 0, undef) - trim to an easy-to-use structure
                       3 - no trimming (in version 1.06, prior to version
                           1.06, 0 or undef means no trimming)
                     This function is duplicate to EntrezGene.pm's and code should
                       be compressed in the future (using util module &amp; subclass).

   <b>fh</b>
         Parameters: $filehandle (optional)
         Example:    trimdata($datahash); # using the default flag
         Function:   getter/setter for file handle
         Returns:    file handle for current file being parsed.
         Notes:      Use with care!
                     Line number report would not be corresponding to file's line
                       number if seek operation is performed on the file handle!

   <b>rawdata</b>
         Parameters: none
         Example:    my $data = $parser-&gt;rawdata();
         Function:   Get the sequence data file that was just parsed
         Returns:    a string containing the ASN1-formatted sequence record
         Notes:      Must first parse a record then call this function!
                     Could be useful in interpreting line number value in error
                       report (if user did a seek on file handle right before parsing
                       call)

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>_parse</b>
       NCBI's Apr 05, 2005 format change forced much usage of lookahead, which would for sure slows parser down.
       But can't code efficiently without it.

       None.
