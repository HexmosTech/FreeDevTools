</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::FeatureHolderI - the base interface an object with features must implement

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Bio::SeqIO;
           # get a feature-holding object somehow: for example, Bio::SeqI objects
           # have features
           my $seqio = Bio::SeqIO-&gt;new(-fh =&gt; \*STDIN, -format =&gt; 'genbank');
           while (my $seq = $seqio-&gt;next_seq()) {
               # $seq is-a Bio::FeatureHolderI, hence:
               my @feas = $seq-&gt;get_SeqFeatures();
               # each element is-a Bio::SeqFeatureI
               foreach my $fea (@feas) {
                   # do something with the feature objects
               }
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the base interface that all feature-holding objects must implement.

       Popular feature-holders are for instance Bio::Seq objects. Since Bio::SeqFeatureI defines a
       <b>sub_SeqFeature()</b> method, most Bio::SeqFeatureI implementations like Bio::SeqFeature::Generic will
       implement the feature holder interface as well.

       The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods.  Internal methods are usually preceded
       with a _

   <b>get_SeqFeatures()</b>
        Usage   : @feats = $obj-&gt;get_SeqFeatures()
        Function: Get the feature objects held by this feature holder.
        Example :
        Returns : an array of Bio::SeqFeatureI implementing objects
                  if tag specified, return features having that tag
        Args    : [optional] scalar string (feature tag)

   <b>add_SeqFeature()</b>
        Usage   : $feat-&gt;add_SeqFeature($subfeat);
                  $feat-&gt;add_SeqFeature($subfeat,'EXPAND')
        Function: Add a SeqFeature into the subSeqFeature array.
                  with no 'EXPAND' qualifer, subfeat will be tested
                  as to whether it lies inside the parent, and throw
                  an exception if not.

                  If EXPAND is used and the object implements Bio::RangeI
                  (which is not guaranteed), the parent''s start/end/strand
                  will be extended so that the new subFeature can be accomodated.
        Example :
        Returns : nothing
        Args    : a Bio::SeqFeatureI object

   <b>remove_SeqFeatures()</b>
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;remove_SeqFeatures
        Function: Removes all sub SeqFeatures.  If you want to remove only a subset,
                  remove that subset from the returned array, and add back the rest.
        Returns : The array of Bio::SeqFeatureI implementing sub-features that was
                  deleted from this feature.
        Args    : none

   <b>feature_count</b>
        Title   : feature_count
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;feature_count()
        Function: Return the number of SeqFeatures attached to a feature holder.

                  This is before flattening a possible sub-feature tree.

                  We provide a default implementation here that just counts
                  the number of objects returned by get_SeqFeatures().
                  Implementors may want to override this with a more
                  efficient implementation.

        Returns : integer representing the number of SeqFeatures
        Args    : None

       At some day we may want to expand this method to allow for a feature filter to be passed in.

       Our default implementation allows for any number of additional arguments and will pass them on to
       <b>get_SeqFeatures()</b>. I.e., in order to support filter arguments, just support them in <b>get_SeqFeatures()</b>.

   <b>get_all_SeqFeatures</b>
        Title   : get_all_SeqFeatures
        Usage   :
        Function: Get the flattened tree of feature objects held by this
                  feature holder. The difference to get_SeqFeatures is that
                  the entire tree of sub-features will be flattened out.

                  We provide a default implementation here, so implementors
                  don''t necessarily need to implement this method.

        Example :
        Returns : an array of Bio::SeqFeatureI implementing objects
        Args    : none

       At some day we may want to expand this method to allow for a feature filter to be passed in.

       Our default implementation allows for any number of additional arguments and will pass them on to any
       invocation of <b>get_SeqFeatures()</b>, wherever a component of the tree implements FeatureHolderI. I.e., in
       order to support filter arguments, just support them in <b>get_SeqFeatures()</b>.
