</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::DB::Biblio::soap - a SOAP-based access to a bibliographic query service

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.70

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Do not use this object directly, it is recommended to access it and use it through the <u>Bio::Biblio</u>
       module:

         use Bio::Biblio;
         my $biblio = Bio::Biblio-&gt;new (-access =&gt; 'soap');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This object contains the real implementation of a Bibliographic Query Service as defined in
       Bio::DB::BiblioI - using a SOAP protocol to access a WebService (a remote server) that represents a
       bibliographic repository.

       The main documentation details are to be found in Bio::DB::BiblioI.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Defaults</b>
        Usage   : print $Bio::DB::Biblio::soap::DEFAULT_SERVICE;
                  print $Bio::DB::Biblio::soap::DEFAULT_NAMESPACE;

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>_initialize</b>
        Usage   : my $obj = Bio::Biblio-&gt;new(-access =&gt; 'soap' ...);
                  (_initialize is internally called from this constructor)
        Returns : nothing interesting
        Args    : This module recognises and uses following arguments:

                    -namespace =&gt; 'urn'
                      The namespace used by the WebService that is being
                      accessed. It is a string which guarantees its world-wide
                      uniqueness - therefore it often has a style of a URL -
                      but it does not mean that such pseudo-URL really exists.

                      ## TODO: This namespace is no longer valid (check for deprecation
                      ## or update)

                      Default is '<a href="http://industry.ebi.ac.uk/openBQS">http://industry.ebi.ac.uk/openBQS</a>'.

                    -destroy_on_exit =&gt; '0'
                       Default value is '1' which means that all Bio::Biblio
                       objects - when being finalised - will send a request
                       to the remote WebService to forget the query collections
                       they represent.

                       If you change it to '0' make sure that you know the
                       query collection identification - otherwise you will
                       not be able to re-established connection with it.
                       This can be done by calling method get_collection_id.

                     -collection_id =&gt; '...'
                       It defines what query collection will this object work
                       with. Use this argument when you know a collection ID
                       of an existing query collection and when you wish to
                       re-established connection with it.

                       By default, the collection IDs are set automatically
                       by the query methods - they return Bio::Biblio objects
                       already having a collection ID.

                       A missing or undefined collection ID means that the
                       object represents the whole bibliographic repository
                       (which again means that some methods, like get_all,
                       will be probably refused).

                     -soap =&gt; a SOAP::Lite object
                       Usually all Bio::Biblio objects share an instance of
                       the underlying SOAP::Lite module. But you are free
                       to have more - perhaps with different characteristics.

                       See the code for attributes of the default SOAP::Lite
                       object.

                     -httpproxy =&gt; '<a href="http://server">http://server</a>:port'
                        In addition to the 'location' parameter, you may need
                        to specify also a location/URL of a HTTP proxy server
                        (if your site requires one).

                  Additionally, the main module Bio::Biblio recognises
                  also:
                     -access =&gt; '...'
                     -location =&gt; '...'

       It populates calling object with the given arguments, and then - for some attributes and only if they are
       not yet populated - it assigns some default values.

       This is an actual <b>new()</b> method (except for the real object creation and its blessing which is done in the
       parent class Bio::Root::Root in method _create_object).

       Note that this method is called always as an <u>object</u> method (never as a <u>class</u> method) - and that the
       object who calls this method may already be partly initiated (from Bio::Biblio::new method); so if you
       need to do some tricks with the 'class invocation' you need to change Bio::Biblio::new method, not this
       one.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
           * Methods returning a boolean value (<u>has_next</u>, <u>exists</u> and <u>contains</u>) can be used only with SOAP::Lite
           version 0.52 and newer (probably due to a bug in the older SOAP::Lite).  * It does not use WSDL.  *
           More testing and debugging needed to ensure that returned citations are properly transferred even if
           they contain foreign characters.

</pre><h4><b>FEEDBACK</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Mailing</b> <b>lists</b>
       User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other Bioperl modules. Send your comments
       and suggestions preferably to the Bioperl mailing list.  Your participation is much appreciated.

       Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list: <u><a href="mailto:bioperl-l@bioperl.org">bioperl-l@bioperl.org</a></u>

       rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and reponsive experts will be able look
       at the problem and quickly address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem with code and
       data examples if at all possible.
