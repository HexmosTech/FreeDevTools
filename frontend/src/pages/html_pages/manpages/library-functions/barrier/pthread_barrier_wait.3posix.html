</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pthread_barrier_wait — synchronize at a barrier

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</a>&gt;

       int pthread_barrier_wait(pthread_barrier_t *<u>barrier</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>pthread_barrier_wait</u>() function shall synchronize participating threads at the barrier referenced by
       <u>barrier</u>.   The  calling  thread  shall  block  until  the  required  number  of   threads   have   called
       <u>pthread_barrier_wait</u>() specifying the barrier.

       When  the  required  number  of  threads  have  called <u>pthread_barrier_wait</u>() specifying the barrier, the
       constant PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD shall be returned to one unspecified  thread  and  zero  shall  be
       returned  to each of the remaining threads. At this point, the barrier shall be reset to the state it had
       as a result of the most recent <u>pthread_barrier_init</u>() function that referenced it.

       The constant PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD is defined in <u>&lt;pthread.h&gt;</u> and its value shall be distinct from
       any other value returned by <u>pthread_barrier_wait</u>().

       The results are undefined if this function is called with an uninitialized barrier.

       If a signal is delivered to a thread blocked on a barrier, upon return from the signal handler the thread
       shall resume waiting at the barrier if the barrier wait has not  completed  (that  is,  if  the  required
       number of threads have not arrived at the barrier during the execution of the signal handler); otherwise,
       the  thread  shall  continue  as  normal  from the completed barrier wait. Until the thread in the signal
       handler returns from it, it is unspecified whether other threads may proceed past the barrier  once  they
       have all reached it.

       A thread that has blocked on a barrier shall not prevent any unblocked thread that is eligible to use the
       same  processing  resources  from  eventually  making  forward progress in its execution. Eligibility for
       processing resources shall be determined by the scheduling policy.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon     successful     completion,     the     <u>pthread_barrier_wait</u>()     function     shall      return
       PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD  for  a  single (arbitrary) thread synchronized at the barrier and zero for
       each of the other threads. Otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       This function shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Applications using this function may  be  subject  to  priority  inversion,  as  discussed  in  the  Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>3.291</u>, <u>Priority</u> <u>Inversion</u>.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       If  an  implementation detects that the value specified by the <u>barrier</u> argument to <u>pthread_barrier_wait</u>()
       does not refer to an initialized barrier object, it is recommended that  the  function  should  fail  and
       report an <b>[EINVAL]</b> error.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
