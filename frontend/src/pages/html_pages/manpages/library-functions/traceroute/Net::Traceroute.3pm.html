</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Traceroute - <a href="../man1/traceroute.1.html">traceroute</a>(1) functionality in perl

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Net::Traceroute;
           $tr = Net::Traceroute-&gt;new(host =&gt; "life.ai.mit.edu");
           if($tr-&gt;found) {
               my $hops = $tr-&gt;hops;
               if($hops &gt; 1) {
                   print "Router was " .
                       $tr-&gt;hop_query_host($tr-&gt;hops - 1, 0) . "\n";
               }
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements a parser for various traceroute implementations.  At present, it can parse most
       LBL traceroute derivatives used on typical unixes, and the traceroute of cisco IOS.  Traceroutes known
       not to be supported include that of Microsoft Windows and HP-UX.

       This module has two basic modes of operation, one, where it will run traceroute for you, and the other
       where you provide text from previously running traceroute to parse.

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       A new Net::Traceroute object must be created with the <u>new</u> method.  Depending on exactly how the
       constructor is invoked, it may perform some tracing and/or parsing actions immediately, or it may return
       a "template" object that can be used to set parameters for several subsequent traceroutes.

       Methods are available for accessing information about a given traceroute attempt.  There are also methods
       that view/modify the options that are passed to the object's constructor.

       To trace a route, UDP packets are sent with a small TTL (time-to-live) field in an attempt to get
       intervening routers to generate ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED messages.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CLONING</b></h4><pre>
           $obj = Net::Traceroute-&gt;new([base_port      =&gt; $base_port,]
                                       [debug          =&gt; $debuglvl,]
                                       [max_ttl        =&gt; $max_ttl,]
                                       [host           =&gt; $host,]
                                       [text           =&gt; $text,]
                                       [queries        =&gt; $queries,]
                                       [query_timeout  =&gt; $query_timeout,]
                                       [timeout        =&gt; $timeout,]
                                       [source_address =&gt; $srcaddr,]
                                       [tos            =&gt; $tos,]
                                       [packetlen      =&gt; $packetlen,]
                                       [trace_program  =&gt; $program,]
                                       [no_fragment    =&gt; $nofrag,]
                                       [use_icmp       =&gt; $useicmp,]
                                       [use_tcp        =&gt; $usetcp,]
                                      );
           $frob = $obj-&gt;clone([options]);

       This is the constructor for a new Net::Traceroute object.  If given "host", it will immediately perform
       the traceroute.  If given "text", it will parse that text as traceroute output.

       Given an existing Net::Traceroute object $obj as a template, you can call $obj-&gt;<b>clone()</b> with the usual
       constructor parameters.  The same rules apply about defining host; that is, traceroute will be run if it
       is defined, or text will be parsed.  You can always pass "host =" undef, text =&gt; undef&gt; to clone.

       Possible options are:

       <b>host</b> - A host to traceroute to.  If you don't set this, you get a Traceroute object with no traceroute
       data in it.  The module always uses IP addresses internally and will attempt to lookup host names via
       inet_aton.

       <b>text</b> - Output from a previously run traceroute.  If set, and host isn't, the given text will be parsed.

       <b>base_port</b> - Base port number to use for the UDP queries.  Traceroute assumes that nothing is listening to
       port "base_port" to "base_port + (nhops - 1)" where nhops is the number of hops required to reach the
       destination address.  Default is what the system traceroute uses (normally 33434).  "Traceroute"'s "-p"
       option.

       <b>debuglvl</b> - A number indicating how verbose debug information should be.  Please include debug=&gt;9 output
       in bug reports.

       <b>max_ttl</b> - Maximum number of hops to try before giving up.  Default is what the system traceroute uses
       (normally 30).  "Traceroute"'s "-m" option.

       <b>queries</b> - Number of times to send a query for a given hop.  Defaults to whatever the system traceroute
       uses (3 for most traceroutes).  "Traceroute"'s "-q" option.

       <b>query_timeout</b> - How many seconds to wait for a response to each query sent.  Uses the system traceroute's
       default value of 5 if unspecified.  "Traceroute"'s "-w" option.

       <b>timeout</b> - Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for the traceroute to complete.  If not specified, the
       traceroute will not return until the host has been reached, or traceroute counts to infinity ("max_ttl" *
       "queries" * "query_timeout").  Note that this option is implemented by Net::Traceroute, not the
       underlying traceroute command.

       <b>source_address</b> - Select the source address that traceroute wil use.

       <b>tos</b> - Specify a ToS value for traceroute to use.

       <b>packetlen</b> - Length of packets to use.  Traceroute tries to make the IP packet exactly this long.

       <b>trace_program</b> - Name of the traceroute program.  Defaults to traceroute.  You can pass traceroute6 to do
       IPv6 traceroutes.

       <b>no_fragment</b> - Set the IP don't fragment bit.  Some traceroute programs will perform path mtu discovery
       with this option.

       <b>use_icmp</b> - Request that traceroute perform probes with ICMP echo packets, rather than UDP.

       <b>use_tcp</b> - Request that traceoute perform probes with TCP SYNs.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       traceroute
           Run  system traceroute, and parse the results.  Will fill in the rest of the object for informational
           queries.

       parse
           Parse the previously provided "text", filling in the rest of the object for queries.

       argv
           Returns a list of arguments that traceroute will be invoked with.  For debugging and/or overriding by
           subclasses.

   <b>Controlling</b> <b>traceroute</b> <b>invocation</b>
       Each of these methods return the current value of the option specified by the  corresponding  constructor
       option.  They will set the object's instance variable to the given value if one is provided.

       Changing an instance variable will only affect newly performed traceroutes.  Setting a different value on
       a traceroute object that has already performed a trace has no effect.

       See the constructor documentation for information about methods that aren't documented here.

       base_port([PORT])
       max_ttl([PORT])
       queries([QUERIES])
       query_timeout([TIMEOUT])
       host([HOST])
       text([TEXT])
       timeout([TIMEOUT])
       source_address([SRC])
       packetlen([LEN])
       trace_program([PROGRAM])
       no_fragment([PROGRAM])

   <b>Obtaining</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>Trace</b>
       These methods return information about a traceroute that has already been performed.

       Any of the methods in this section that return a count of something or want an <u>N</u>th type count to identify
       something employ one based counting.

       stat
           Returns  the  status  of  a  given  traceroute  object.  One of TRACEROUTE_OK, TRACEROUTE_TIMEOUT, or
           TRACEROUTE_UNKNOWN (each defined as an integer).  TRACEROUTE_OK will only be returned if the host was
           actually reachable.

       found
           Attempt to return 1 if the host was found, undef otherwise.  This test is a poor heuristic, and  will
           frequently give wrong answers.

       pathmtu
           If  your  traceroute  supports  MTU discovery, this method will return the MTU in some circumstances.
           You must set no_fragment, and must use a packetlen larger than the path mtu for this to be set.

       hops
           Returns the number of hops that it took to reach the host.

       hop_queries(HOP)
           Returns the number of queries that were sent for a given hop.  This should normally be the  same  for
           every query.

       hop_query_stat(HOP, QUERY)
           Return  the  status of the given HOP's QUERY.  The return status can be one of the following (each of
           these is actually an integer constant function defined in Net::Traceroute's export list):

           QUERY can be zero, in which case the first successful query will be returned.

           TRACEROUTE_OK
               Reached the host, no problems.

           TRACEROUTE_TIMEOUT
               This query timed out.

           TRACEROUTE_UNKNOWN
               Your guess is as good as mine.  Shouldn't happen too often.

           TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_NET
               This hop returned an ICMP Network Unreachable.

           TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_HOST
               This hop returned an ICMP Host Unreachable.

           TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_PROTO
               This hop returned an ICMP Protocol unreachable.

           TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_PORT
               Use in cisco and traceroute6 parsing.  In cisco, "!U", in traceroute6, a "!".

           TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_ADDR
               This hop returned an ICMP6 address unreachable.

           TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_NEEDFRAG
               Indicates that you can't reach this host without  fragmenting  your  packet  further.   Shouldn't
               happen in regular use.

           TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_SRCFAIL
               A source routed packet was rejected for some reason.  Shouldn't happen.

           TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_FILTER_PROHIB
               A  firewall  or  similar  device  has  decreed  that your traffic is disallowed by administrative
               action.  Suspect sheer, raving paranoia.

           TRACEROUTE_BSDBUG
               The destination machine appears to exhibit the 4.[23]BSD time exceeded bug.

           TRACEROUTE_SOURCE_QUENCH
               Some machine has generated an ICMP Source Quench message, asking you to slow down.

           TRACEROUTE_INTERRUPTED
               "User interrupted test".  Cisco's traceroute does this.  Its unclear how to produce it.

       hop_query_host(HOP, QUERY)
           Return the dotted quad IP address of the host that responded to HOP's QUERY.

           QUERY can be zero, in which case the first successful query will be returned.

       hop_query_time(HOP, QUERY)
           Return the round trip time associated with the  given  HOP's  query.   If  your  system's  traceroute
           supports fractional second timing, so will Net::Traceroute.

           QUERY can be zero, in which case the first successful query will be returned.

</pre><h4><b>CLONING</b> <b>SUPPORT</b> <b>BEFORE</b> <b>1.04</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Traceroute Versions before 1.04 used new to clone objects.  This has been deprecated in favor of the
       <b>clone()</b> method.

       If you have code of the form:

        my $template = Net::Traceroute-&gt;new();
        my $tr = $template-&gt;new(host =&gt; "localhost");

       You need to change the $template-&gt;new to $template-&gt;clone.

       This behavior was changed because it interfered with subclassing.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Traceroute  parses  the  output  of the system traceroute command.  As such, it may not work on your
       system.  Support for more traceroute outputs (e.g. Windows, HPUX) could be done, although  currently  the
       code assumes there is "One true traceroute".

       The  actual  functionality of traceroute could also be implemented natively in perl or linked in from a C
       library.

       Versions prior to 1.04 had some interface issues for subclassing.  These issues have been addressed,  but
       required  a  public  interface  change.   If  you  were  relying on the behavior of new to clone existing
       objects, your code needs to be fixed.
