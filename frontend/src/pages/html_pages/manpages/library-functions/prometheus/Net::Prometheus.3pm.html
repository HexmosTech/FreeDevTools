</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "Net::Prometheus" - export monitoring metrics for prometheus

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use Net::Prometheus;

          my $client = Net::Prometheus-&gt;new;

          my $counter = $client-&gt;new_counter(
             name =&gt; "requests",
             help =&gt; "Number of received requests",
          );

          sub handle_request
          {
             $counter-&gt;inc;
             ...
          }

          use Plack::Builder;

          builder {
             mount "/metrics" =&gt; $client-&gt;psgi_app;
             ...
          }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides the ability for a program to collect monitoring metrics and export them to the
       <u>prometheus.io</u> monitoring server.

       As "prometheus" will expect to collect the metrics by making an HTTP request, facilities are provided to
       yield a PSGI application that the containing program can embed in its own structure to provide the
       results, or the application can generate a plain-text result directly and serve them by its own means.

   <b>Metrics::Any</b>
       For more flexibility of metrics reporting, other modules may wish to use Metrics::Any as an abstraction
       interface instead of directly using this API.

       By using "Metrics::Any" instead, the module does not directly depend on "Net::Prometheus", and in
       addition program ultimately using the module gets the flexibility to use Prometheus (via
       Metrics::Any::Adapter::Prometheus) or use another reporting system via a different adapter.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
          $prometheus = Net::Prometheus-&gt;new;

       Returns a new "Net::Prometheus" instance.

       Takes the following named arguments:

       disable_process_collector =&gt; BOOL
           If   present   and   true,   this   instance  will  not  load  the  default  process  collector  from
           Net::Prometheus::ProcessCollector. If absent or false, such a collector will be loaded by default.

       disable_perl_collector =&gt; BOOL
           If   present   and   true,   this   instance   will   not   load   perl-specific    collector    from
           Net::Prometheus::PerlCollector. If absent or false this collector is loaded by default.

           These  two  options  are provided for testing purposes, or for specific use-cases where such features
           are not required. Usually it's best just to leave these enabled.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>register</b>
          $collector = $prometheus-&gt;register( $collector );

       Registers a new collector to be collected from by the "render" method. The collector instance  itself  is
       returned, for convenience.

   <b>unregister</b>
          $prometheus-&gt;unregister( $collector );

       Removes a previously-registered collector.

   <b>new_gauge</b>
          $gauge = $prometheus-&gt;new_gauge( %args );

       Constructs a new Net::Prometheus::Gauge using the arguments given and registers it with the exporter. The
       newly-constructed gauge is returned.

   <b>new_counter</b>
          $counter = $prometheus-&gt;new_counter( %args );

       Constructs  a  new Net::Prometheus::Counter using the arguments given and registers it with the exporter.
       The newly-constructed counter is returned.

   <b>new_summary</b>
          $summary = $prometheus-&gt;new_summary( %args );

       Constructs a new Net::Prometheus::Summary using the arguments given and registers it with  the  exporter.
       The newly-constructed summary is returned.

   <b>new_histogram</b>
          $histogram = $prometheus-&gt;new_histogram( %args );

       Constructs a new Net::Prometheus::Histogram using the arguments given and registers it with the exporter.
       The newly-constructed histogram is returned.

   <b>new_metricgroup</b>
          $group = $prometheus-&gt;new_metricgroup( %args );

       Returns  a  new  Metric  Group  instance as a convenience for registering multiple metrics using the same
       "namespace" and "subsystem" arguments. Takes the following named arguments:

       namespace =&gt; STR
       subsystem =&gt; STR
           String values to pass by default into new metrics the group will construct.

       Once constructed, the group acts as a proxy to the other "new_*" methods,  passing  in  these  values  as
       overrides.

          $gauge = $group-&gt;new_gauge( ... );
          $counter = $group-&gt;new_counter( ... );
          $summary = $group-&gt;new_summary( ... );
          $histogram = $group-&gt;new_histogram( ... );

   <b>collect</b>
          @metricsamples = $prometheus-&gt;collect( $opts );

       Returns a list of "MetricSamples" in Net::Prometheus::Types obtained from all of the currently-registered
       collectors.

   <b>render</b>
          $str = $prometheus-&gt;render;

       Returns  a  string  in  the  Prometheus  text  exposition format containing the current values of all the
       registered metrics.

          $str = $prometheus-&gt;render( { options =&gt; "for collectors" } );

       An optional HASH reference may be provided; if so it will be passed into the "collect"  method  of  every
       registered collector.

       Values  that  are  set to "undef" will be absent from the output (this usually applies to gauges). Values
       set to NaN will be rendered as "NaN".

   <b>handle</b>
          $response = $prometheus-&gt;handle( $request );

       Given an HTTP request in an HTTP::Request instance, renders the metrics in response to it and returns  an
       HTTP::Response instance.

       This  application will respond to any "GET" request, and reject requests for any other method. If a query
       string is present on the URI it will be parsed for collector options to pass into the "render" method.

       This method is useful for integrating metrics into an existing HTTP server application which  uses  these
       objects. For example:

          my $prometheus = Net::Prometheus-&gt;new;

          sub serve_request
          {
             my ( $request ) = @_;

             if( $request-&gt;uri-&gt;path eq "/metrics" ) {
                return $prometheus-&gt;handle( $request );
             }

             ...
          }

   <b>psgi_app</b>
          $app = $prometheus-&gt;psgi_app;

       Returns  a  new  PSGI  application as a "CODE" reference. This application will render the metrics in the
       Prometheus text exposition format, suitable for scraping by the Prometheus collector.

       This application will respond to any "GET" request, and reject  requests  for  any  other  method.  If  a
       "QUERY_STRING"  is  present  in  the environment it will be parsed for collector options to pass into the
       "render" method.

       This method is useful for integrating metrics into an existing HTTP server application which is  uses  or
       is based on PSGI. For example:

          use Plack::Builder;

          my $prometheus = Net::Prometheus::-&gt;new;

          builder {
             mount "/metrics" =&gt; $prometheus-&gt;psgi_app;
             ...
          }

   <b>export_to_Future_IO</b>
          $f = $prometheus-&gt;export_to_Future_IO( %args );

       Performs  the  necessary  steps to create a minimal HTTP server for exporting metrics over HTTP, by using
       Future::IO directly. This requires "Future::IO" version 0.11 or above, and a containing process that  has
       already loaded a non-default loop implementation that supports multiple filehandles.

       This  new  server  will  listen  on  its own port number for any incoming request, and will serve metrics
       regardless of path.

       This server is a very small, minimal implementation just sufficient to support  "prometheus"  itself,  or
       simple tools like "wget", "curl" or perhaps a web-browser for manual inspection. It is not intended to be
       a fully-featured HTTP server and certainly does not support many HTTP features at all.

       Takes the following named arguments:

       port =&gt; INT
           Port number on which to listen for incoming HTTP requests.

       The  returned  Future  instance  will  remain  pending  for  the  entire  lifetime of the process. If the
       containing program has nothing else to do it can call the "await" method on it, or else combine  it  with
       other toplevel event futures it is using for its own purposes.

   <b>export_to_IO_Async</b>
          $prometheus-&gt;export_to_IO_Async( $loop, %args );

       Performs the necessary steps to create an HTTP server for exporting metrics over HTTP via IO::Async. This
       will involve creating a new Net::Async::HTTP::Server instance added to the loop.

       This  new  server  will  listen  on  its own port number for any incoming request, and will serve metrics
       regardless of path.

       Note this should only be used in applications that don't otherwise have an HTTP  server,  such  as  self-
       contained monitoring exporters or exporting metrics as a side-effect of other activity. For existing HTTP
       server  applications  it  is  better  to  integrate  with the existing request/response processing of the
       application, such as by using the "handle" or "psgi_app" methods.

       Takes the following named arguments:

       port =&gt; INT
           Port number on which to listen for incoming HTTP requests.

</pre><h4><b>COLLECTORS</b></h4><pre>
       The toplevel "Net::Prometheus" object stores a list of "collector" instances, which are used to  generate
       the values that will be made visible via the "render" method. A collector can be any object instance that
       has a method called "collect", which when invoked is passed no arguments and expected to return a list of
       "MetricSamples" in Net::Prometheus::Types structures.

          @metricsamples = $collector-&gt;collect( $opts )

       The  Net::Prometheus::Metric  class  is  already  a valid collector (and hence, so too are the individual
       metric type subclasses). This interface allows the creation of new custom collector  objects,  that  more
       directly collect information to be exported.

       Collectors  might  choose  to  behave  differently  in  the  presence  of some specifically-named option;
       typically to provide extra detail not normally provided (maybe at the expense of extra processing time to
       calculate it).  Collectors must not complain about the presence of  unrecognised  options;  the  hash  is
       shared among all potential collectors.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       •       Histogram/Summary 'start_timer' support

       •       Add other "export_to_*" methods for other event systems and HTTP-serving frameworks, e.g. Mojo.
