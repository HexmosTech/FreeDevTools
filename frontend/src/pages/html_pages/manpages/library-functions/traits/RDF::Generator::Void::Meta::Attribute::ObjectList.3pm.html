       RDF::Generator::Void::Meta::Attribute::ObjectList - Trait for list of RDF objects

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        has _endpoints =&gt; ( traits =&gt; ['ObjectList'] );
        has _titles =&gt; (
                                         traits =&gt; ['ObjectList'],
                                         isa      =&gt; 'ArrayRef[RDF::Trine::Node::Literal]',
                                        );
        has resources =&gt; ( traits =&gt; ['ObjectList'] );

   <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This module gives you a trait to manage a list of RDF resources typically used in an object position in
       an RDF triple. When declaring attributes, you may use "traits =" ['ObjectList']&gt; alone in which case
       it'll give you a arrayref of strings and the methods to push to the array, list all strings in the array,
       and to check if it is empty. These are created by prefixing "add_", "all_" and "has_no_" to your
       attribute name, respectively.

       If you have an underscore in the beginning, the attribute will not itself be a method, but you can still
       use the non-prefixed attribute name as argument to the constructor, and you will have the same methods as
       above.

       You may also give a "isa" argument to the attribute. In that case, you may set the arrayref to contain
       something other than strings, like in the example above.
