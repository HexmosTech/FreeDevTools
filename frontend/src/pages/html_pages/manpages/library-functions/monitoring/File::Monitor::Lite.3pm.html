</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::Monitor::Lite - Monitor file changes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use File::Monitor::Lite;

         my $monitor = File::Monitor::Lite-&gt;new (
             in =&gt; '.',
             name =&gt; '*.html',
         );

         while ($monitor-&gt;check() and sleep 1){
             my @deleted_files = $monitor-&gt;deleted;
             my @modified_files = $monitor-&gt;modified;
             my @created_files = $monitor-&gt;created;
             my @observing_files = $monitor-&gt;observed;
             `do blah..` if $monitor-&gt;anychange;
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is another implementation of File::Monitor. While File::Monitor cannot detect file creation (unless
       you declare file name first), I use File::Find::Rule to rescan files every time when $monitor-&gt;<b>check()</b> is
       executed. To use this module, just follow synopsis above.

       Currently one cannot change file observing rules. To do so, create another monitor object with new rules.

           $m1=File::Monitor::Lite-&gt;new(
               name =&gt; '*.html',
               in =&gt; '.',
           );
           $m1-&gt;check();
           #blah...
           $m2=File::Monitor::Lite-&gt;new(
               name =&gt; '*.css',
               in =&gt; '.',
           );
           $m2-&gt;check();
           #blah...

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       " new ( args ) "
           Create a new "File::Monitor::Lite" object.

               my $monitor = File::Monitor::Lite-&gt;new(
                   in =&gt; '.',
                   name =&gt; '*.mp3',
               );

           The syntax is inherited from File::Find::Rule. It will applied on File::Find::Rule as

               File::Find::Rule
                   -&gt;file()
                   -&gt;name('*.mp3')
                   -&gt;in('.');

           As described in File::Find::Rule, name can be globs or regular expressions.

               name =&gt; '*.pm',                     # a simple glob
               name =&gt; qr/.+\.pm$/,                # regex
               name =&gt; ['*.mp3', qr/.+\.ogg$/],    # array of rules
               name =&gt; @rules,

       " check() "
           Check  if any file recognized by File::Find::Rule has changed (created, modified, deleted.) The usage
           is simple:

               $monitor-&gt;check();

       " created "
           Returns an array of file names which has been created since last check.

       " modified "
           Returns an array of file names which has been modified since last check.

       " deleted "
           Returns an array of file names which has been deleted since last check.

       " observed "
           Returns an array of file names which monitor is observing at.
