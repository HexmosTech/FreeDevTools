</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::Monitor::Object - Monitor a filesystem object for changes.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes File::Monitor::Object version 1.00

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Created by File::Monitor to monitor a single file or directory.

           use File::Monitor;
           use File::Monitor::Object;

           my $monitor = File::Monitor-&gt;new();

           for my $file ( @files ) {
               $monitor-&gt;watch( $file );
           }

           # First scan just finds out about the monitored files. No changes
           # will be reported.
           $monitor-&gt;scan;

           # Later perform a scan and gather any changes
           for my $change ( $monitor-&gt;scan ) {
               # $change is a File::Monitor::Delta
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Monitors changes to a single file or directory. Don't create a "File::Monitor::Object" directly; instead
       call "watch" on File::Monitor.

       A "File::Monitor::Object" represents a single file or directory. The corresponding file or directory need
       not exist; a file being created is one of the events that is monitored for. Similarly if the file or
       directory is deleted that will be reported as a change.

       Changes of state are returned as a File::Monitor::Delta object.

       The state of the monitored file or directory at the time of the last "scan" can be queried. Before "scan"
       is called these methods will all return "undef". The following methods return the value of the
       corresponding field from "stat" in perlfunc:

           dev inode mode num_links uid gid rdev size
           atime mtime ctime blk_size blocks

       For example:

           my $file_size = $object-&gt;size;
           my $modified  = $object-&gt;mtime;

       If any error occured during the previous "scan" it may be retrieved like this:

           my $last_error = $obj-&gt;error;

       It is not an error for the file being monitored not to exist.

       Finally if a directory is being monitored and the "files" or "recurse" option was specified the list of
       files in the directory may be retrieved like this:

           my @contained_files = $obj-&gt;files;

       If "files" was specified this will return the files and directories immediately below the monitored
       directory but not the contents of any subdirectories. If "recurse" was specified the entire directory
       tree below this directory will be returned.

       In either case the returned filenames will be complete absolute paths.

   <b>Caveat</b> <b>for</b> <b>Directories</b>
       Note that "File::Monitor::Object" has no magical way to quickly perform a recursive scan of a directory.
       If you point it at a directory containing 1,000,000 files and specify the "recurse" option directory
       scans <u>will</u> take a long time.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       "new( $args )"
           Create a new "File::Monitor::Object". Don't call "new" directly; use instead File::Monitor-&gt;watch.

       "scan()"
           Perform  a  scan  of  the monitored file or directory and return a list of changes. The returned list
           will contain either a single File::Monitor::Delta object describing all changes or will be  empty  if
           no changes occurred.

               if ( my $change = $object-&gt;scan ) {
                   # $change is a File::Monitor::Delta that describes all the
                   # changes to the monitored file or directory.
               }

           When "scan" is first called the current state of the monitored file/directory will be captured but no
           change will be reported.

       "callback( [ $event, ] $coderef )"
           Register a callback. If $event is omitted the callback will be called for all changes. Specify $event
           to limit the callback to certain event types. See File::Monitor::Delta for a full list of events.

               $object-&gt;callback( sub {
                   # called for all changes
               } );

               $object-&gt;callback( metadata =&gt; sub {
                   # called for changes to file/directory metatdata
               } );

           See File::Monitor::Delta for a full list of events that can be monitored.

       "name"
           Returns  the  absolute  name of the file or directory being monitored. If "new" was passed a relative
           path it is resolved relative to the current directory at the time  of  object  creation  to  make  it
           absolute.

       "files"
           If  monitoring  a  directory  and  the  "recurse" or "files" options were specified to "new", "files"
           returns a list of contained files. The returned filenames will be absolute paths.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Accessors</b>
       In addition to the above the following methods may be called to return the  value  of  the  corresponding
       field from "stat" in perlfunc:

           dev inode mode num_links uid gid rdev size
           atime mtime ctime blk_size blocks

       For example:

           my $inode = $obj-&gt;inode;

       Check the documentation for "stat" in perlfunc to discover which fields are valid on your platform.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       "%s is read-only"
           You  have  attempted  to  modify  a  read-only accessor. It may be tempting for example to attempt to
           change the name of the monitored file or directory like this:

               # Won't work
               $obj-&gt;name( 'somefile.txt' );

           All of the attributes exposed by "File::Monitor::Object" are read-only.

       "When options are supplied as a hash there may be no other arguments"
           When creating a new "File::Monitor::Object" you must either supply "new" with a reference to  a  hash
           of options or, as a special case, pass a filename and optionally a callback.

       "The name option must be supplied"
           The options hash must contain a key called "name" that specifies the name of the file or directory to
           be monitored.

       "A filename must be specified"
           You must suppy "new" with the name of the file or directory to be monitored.
