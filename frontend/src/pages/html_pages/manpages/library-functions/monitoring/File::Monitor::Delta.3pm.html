       File::Monitor::Delta - Encapsulate a change to a file or directory

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes File::Monitor::Delta version 1.00

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use File::Monitor;

           my $monitor = File::Monitor-&gt;new();

           # Watch some files
           for my $file (qw( myfile.txt yourfile.txt otherfile.txt some_directory )) {
               $monitor-&gt;watch( $file );
           }

           # First scan just finds out about the monitored files. No changes
           # will be reported.
           $object-&gt;scan;

           # After the first scan we get a list of File::Monitor::Delta objects
           # that describe any changes
           my @changes = $object-&gt;scan;

           for my $change (@changes) {
               # Call methods on File::Monitor::Delta to discover what changed
               if ($change-&gt;is_size) {
                   my $name     = $change-&gt;name;
                   my $old_size = $change-&gt;old_size;
                   my $new_size = $change-&gt;new_size;
                   print "$name has changed size from $old_size to $new_size\n";
               }
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When File::Monitor or File::Monitor::Object detects a change to a file or directory it packages the
       details of the change in a "File::Monitor::Delta" object.

       Methods exist to discover the nature of the change ("is_event" et al.), retrieve the attributes of the
       file or directory before and after the change ("old_mtime", "old_mode", "new_mtime", "new_mode" etc),
       retrieve details of the change in a convenient form ("files_created", "files_deleted") and gain access to
       the File::Monitor::Object for which the change was observed ("object").

       Unless you are writing a subclass of "File::Monitor::Object" it isn't normally necessary to instantiate
       "File::Monitor::Delta" objects directly.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>Classified</b>
       Various types of change are identified and classified into the following hierarchy:

           change
               created
               deleted
               metadata
                   time
                       mtime
                       ctime
                   perms
                       uid
                       gid
                       mode
                   size
               directory
                   files_created
                   files_deleted

       The terminal nodes of that tree ("created", "deleted", "mtime", "ctime", "uid", "gid", "mode", "size",
       "files_created" and "files_deleted") represent actual change events. Non terminal nodes represent broader
       classifications of events. For example if a file's mtime changes the resulting "File::Monitor::Delta"
       object will return true for each of

           $delta-&gt;is_mtime;       # The actual change
           $delta-&gt;is_time;        # One of the file times changed
           $delta-&gt;is_metadata;    # The file's metadata changed
           $delta-&gt;is_change;      # This is true for any change

       This event classification is used to target callbacks at specific events or categories of events. See
       File::Monitor and File::Monitor::Object for more information about callbacks.

   <b>Accessors</b>
       Various accessors allow the state of the object before and after the change and the details of the change
       to be queried.

       These accessors return information about the state of the file or directory before the detected change:

           old_dev old_inode old_mode old_num_links old_uid old_gid
           old_rdev old_size old_mtime old_ctime old_blk_size old_blocks
           old_error old_files

       For example:

           my $mode_was = $delta-&gt;old_mode;

       These accessors return information about the state of the file or directory after the detected change:

           new_dev new_inode new_mode new_num_links new_uid new_gid
           new_rdev new_size new_mtime new_ctime new_blk_size new_blocks
           new_error new_files

       For example:

           my $new_size = $delta-&gt;new_size;

       These accessors return a value that reflects the change in the corresponding attribute:

           created deleted mtime ctime uid gid mode size

       With the exception of "mode", "created" and "deleted" they return the difference between the old value
       and the new value. This is only really useful in the case of "size":

           my $grown_by = $delta-&gt;size;

       Is equivalent to

           my $grown_by = $delta-&gt;new_size - $delta-&gt;old_size;

       For the other values the subtraction is performed merely to ensure that these values are non-zero.

           # Get the difference between the old and new UID. Unlikely to be
           # interesting.
           my $delta_uid = $delta-&gt;uid;

       As a special case the delta value for "mode" is computed as old_mode ^ new_mode. The old mode is XORed
       with the new mode so that

           my $bits_changed = $delta-&gt;mode;

       gets a bitmask of the mode bits that have changed.

       If the detected change was the creation or deletion of a file "created" or "deleted" respectively will be
       true.

           if ( $delta-&gt;created ) {
               print "Yippee! We exist\n";
           }

           if ( $delta-&gt;deleted ) {
               print "Boo! We got deleted\n";
           }

       For a directory which is being monitored with the "recurse" or "files" options (see File::Monitor::Object
       for details) "files_created" and "files_deleted" will contain respectively the list of new files below
       this directory and the list of files that have been deleted.

           my @new_files = $delta-&gt;files_created;

           for my $file ( @new_files ) {
               print "$file created\n";
           }

           my @gone_away = $delta-&gt;files_deletedl

           for my $file ( @gone_away ) {
               print "$file deleted\n";
           }

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       "new( $args )"
           Create a new "File::Monitor::Delta" object. You don't normally need to do this; deltas are created as
           necessary by File::Monitor::Object.

           The single argument is a reference to a hash that must contain the following keys:

           object
               The File::Monitor::Object for which this change is being reported.

           old_info
               A hash describing the state of the file or directory before the change.

           new_info
               A hash describing the state of the file or directory after the change.

       "is_event( $event )"
           Returns  true if this delta represents the specified event. For example, if a file's size changes the
           following will all return true:

               $delta-&gt;is_event('size');        # The actual change
               $delta-&gt;is_event('metadata');    # The file's metadata changed
               $delta-&gt;is_event('change');      # This is true for any change

           Valid eventnames are

               change created deleted metadata time mtime ctime perms uid gid
               mode size directory files_created files_deleted

           As an alternative interface you may call "is_"<u>eventname</u> directly.  For example

               $delta-&gt;is_size;
               $delta-&gt;is_metadata;
               $delta-&gt;is_change;

           Unless the event you wish to test for is variable this is a cleaner, less error prone interface.

           Normally your code won't see a "File::Monitor::Delta" for which "is_change" returns false. Any change
           causes "is_change" to be true and the "scan" methods of "File::Monitor"  and  "File::Monitor::Object"
           don't return deltas for unchanged files.

       "name"
           The name of the file for which the change is being reported. Read only.

       "object"
           The File::Monitor::Object for which this change is being reported.

   <b>Other</b> <b>methods</b>
       As  mentioned  above a large number of other accessors are provided to get the state of the object before
       and after the change and query details of the change:

           old_dev old_inode old_mode old_num_links old_uid old_gid old_rdev
           old_size old_mtime old_ctime old_blk_size old_blocks old_error
           old_files new_dev new_inode new_mode new_num_links new_uid new_gid
           new_rdev new_size new_mtime new_ctime new_blk_size new_blocks
           new_error new_files created deleted mtime ctime uid gid mode size
           files_created files_deleted name

       See "Accessors" for details of these.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       "%s is read-only"
           "File::Monitor::Delta" is an immutable description of a  change  in  a  file's  state.  None  of  its
           accessors allow values to be changed.

       "You must supply a value for %s"
           The three options that "new" ("old_info", "new_info" and "object") are all mandatory.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       File::Monitor::Delta requires no configuration files or environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
