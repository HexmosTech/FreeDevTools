</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Locale::Recode - Object-Oriented Portable Charset Conversion

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Locale::Recode;

         $cd = Locale::Recode-&gt;new (from =&gt; 'UTF-8',
                                    to   =&gt; 'ISO-8859-1');

         die $cd-&gt;getError if $cd-&gt;getError;

         $cd-&gt;recode ($text) or die $cd-&gt;getError;

         $mime_name = Locale::Recode-&gt;resolveAlias ('latin-1');

         $supported = Locale::Recode-&gt;getSupported;

         $complete = Locale::Recode-&gt;getCharsets;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides routines that convert textual data from one codeset to another in a portable way.
       The module has been started before <b><a href="../man3/Encode.3.html">Encode</a></b>(3) was written.  It's main purpose today is to provide charset
       conversion even when <b><a href="../man3/Encode.3.html">Encode</a></b>(3) is not available on the system.  It should also work for older Perl
       versions without Unicode support.

       Internally <b>Locale::<a href="../man3/Recode.3.html">Recode</a></b>(3) will use <b><a href="../man3/Encode.3.html">Encode</a></b>(3) whenever possible, to allow for a faster conversion and
       for a wider range of supported charsets, and will only fall back to the Perl implementation when
       <b><a href="../man3/Encode.3.html">Encode</a></b>(3) is not available or does not support a particular charset that <b>Locale::<a href="../man3/Recode.3.html">Recode</a></b>(3) does.

       <b>Locale::<a href="../man3/Recode.3.html">Recode</a></b>(3) is part of libintl-perl, and it's main purpose is actually to implement a portable
       charset conversion framework for the message translation facilities described in <b>Locale::<a href="../man3/TextDomain.3.html">TextDomain</a></b>(3).

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       The constructor new() requires two named arguments:

       <b>from</b>
           The encoding of the original data.  Case doesn't matter, aliases are resolved.

       <b>to</b>  The target encoding.  Again, case doesn't matter, and aliases are resolved.

       The  constructor  will never fail.  In case of an error, the object's internal state is set to bad and it
       will refuse to do any conversions.   You  can  inquire  the  reason  for  the  failure  with  the  method
       <b>getError()</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following object methods are available.

       <b>recode</b> <b>(STRING)</b>
           Converts  <b>STRING</b> from the source encoding into the destination encoding.  In case of success, a truth
           value is returned, false otherwise.  You can inquire the reason  for  the  failure  with  the  method
           <b>getError()</b>.

       <b>getError</b>
           Returns either false if the object is not in an error state or an error message.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The object provides some additional class methods:

       <b>getSupported</b>
           Returns  a  reference  to  a  list  of  all  supported charsets.  This may implicitly load additional
           <b><a href="../man3/Encode.3.html">Encode</a></b>(3) conversions like <b>Encode::<a href="../man3/HanExtra.3.html">HanExtra</a></b>(3) which may produce considerable load on your system.

           The method is therefore not intended for regular use but rather for getting resp. displaying  <u>once</u>  a
           list of available encodings.

           The members of the list are all converted to uppercase!

       <b>getCharsets</b>
           Like <b>getSupported()</b> but also returns all available aliases.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>CHARSETS</b></h4><pre>
       The  range of supported charsets is system-dependent.  The following somewhat special charsets are always
       available:

       <b>UTF-8</b>
           UTF-8 is available independently of your Perl version.  For Perl 5.6 or better or in the presence  of
           <b><a href="../man3/Encode.3.html">Encode</a></b>(3),  conversions  are  not  done  in Perl but with the interfaces provided by these facilities
           which are written in C, hence much faster.

           Encoding data <u>into</u> UTF-8 is fast, even if it is done in Perl.  Decoding it in Perl may  become  quite
           slow.  If you frequently have to decode UTF-8 with <b>Locale::Recode</b> you will probably want to make sure
           that you do that with Perl 5.6 or beter, or install <b><a href="../man3/Encode.3.html">Encode</a></b>(3) to speed up things.

       <b>INTERNAL</b>
           UTF-8 is fast to write but hard to read for applications.  It is therefore not the worst for internal
           string  representation  but  not  far  from  that.   <b>Locale::<a href="../man3/Recode.3.html">Recode</a></b>(3) stores strings internally as a
           reference to an array of integer values like most programming languages (Perl is  an  exception)  do,
           trading memory for performance.

           The integer values are the UCS-4 codes of the characters in host byte order.

           The encoding <b>INTERNAL</b> is directly available via <b>Locale::<a href="../man3/Recode.3.html">Recode</a></b>(3) but of course you should not really
           use it for data exchange, unless you know what you are doing.

       <b>Locale::<a href="../man3/Recode.3.html">Recode</a></b>(3) has native support for a plethora of other encodings, most of them 8 bit encodings that
       are  fast  to  decode,  including  most  encodings  used  on popular micros like the ISO-8859-* series of
       encodings, most Windows-* encodings (also known as CP*), Macintosh, Atari, etc.

</pre><h4><b>NAMES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ALIASES</b></h4><pre>
       Each charset resp. encoding is available internally under a unique name.  Whenever  the  information  was
       available,  the preferred MIME name (see &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/">http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/</a>&gt;) was chosen as
       the internal name.

       Alias handling is quite strict.  The module does not make wild guesses at  what  you  mean  ("What's  the
       meaning  of  the  acronym  JIS"  is a valid alias for "7bit-jis" in <b><a href="../man3/Encode.3.html">Encode</a></b>(3) ....) but aims at providing
       common aliases only.  The same applies to so-called aliases that are really  mistakes,  like  "utf8"  for
       UTF-8.

       The   module   knows   all   aliases   that   are   listed   with   the   IANA   character  set  registry
       (&lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/">http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/</a>&gt;), plus those known to  libiconv  version  1.8,  and  a
       bunch of additional ones.

</pre><h4><b>CONVERSION</b> <b>TABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  conversion  tables  have  either  been  taken  from  official  sources  like the IANA or the Unicode
       Consortium, from Bruno Haible's libiconv, or from the sources of the GNU libc and  the  regression  tests
       for  libintl-perl will check for conformance here.  For some encodings this data differs from <b><a href="../man3/Encode.3.html">Encode</a></b>(3)'s
       data which would cause these tests to fail.  In these cases, the module will  not  invoke  the  <b><a href="../man3/Encode.3.html">Encode</a></b>(3)
       methods, but will fall back to the internal implementation for the sake of consistency.

       The  few  encodings  that  are  affected  are so simple that you will not experience any real performance
       penalty unless you convert large chunks of data.  But the package is not really  intended  for  such  use
       anyway,  and  since  <b><a href="../man3/Encode.3.html">Encode</a></b>(3)  is relatively new, I rather think that the differences are bugs in Encode
       which will be fixed soon.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The module should provide fall back conversions for other Unicode  encoding  schemes  like  UCS-2,  UCS-4
       (big- and little-endian).

       The  pure Perl UTF-8 decoder will not always handle corrupt UTF-8 correctly, especially at the end and at
       the beginning of the string.  This is not likely to be fixed, since the module's intention is not to be a
       consistency checker for UTF-8 data.
