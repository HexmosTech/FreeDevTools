       Encode::Locale - Determine the locale encoding

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Encode::Locale;
         use Encode;

         $string = decode(locale =&gt; $bytes);
         $bytes = encode(locale =&gt; $string);

         if (-t) {
             binmode(STDIN, ":encoding(console_in)");
             binmode(STDOUT, ":encoding(console_out)");
             binmode(STDERR, ":encoding(console_out)");
         }

         # Processing file names passed in as arguments
         my $uni_filename = decode(locale =&gt; $ARGV[0]);
         open(my $fh, "&lt;", encode(locale_fs =&gt; $uni_filename))
            || die "Can't open '$uni_filename': $!";
         binmode($fh, ":encoding(locale)");
         ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it processes.  Most of the
       interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte based.  Programs therefore need to decode byte
       strings that enter the program from the outside and encode them again on the way out.

       The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions requested by the user and the
       preferred character set to consume and output.  The "Encode::Locale" module looks up the charset and
       encoding (called a CODESET in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
       under the name "locale".  It means bytes obtained from the environment can be converted to Unicode
       strings by calling "Encode::encode(locale =&gt; $bytes)" and converted back again with
       "Encode::decode(locale =&gt; $string)".

       Where file systems interfaces pass file names in and out of the program we also need care.  The trend is
       for operating systems to use a fixed file encoding that don't actually depend on the locale; and this
       module determines the most appropriate encoding for file names. The Encode module will know this encoding
       under the name "locale_fs".  For traditional Unix systems this will be an alias to the same encoding as
       "locale".

       For programs running in a terminal window (called a "Console" on some systems) the "locale" encoding is
       usually a good choice for what to expect as input and output.  Some systems allows us to query the
       encoding set for the terminal and "Encode::Locale" will do that if available and make these encodings
       known under the "Encode" aliases "console_in" and "console_out".  For systems where we can't determine
       the terminal encoding these will be aliased as the same encoding as "locale".  The advice is to use
       "console_in" for input known to come from the terminal and "console_out" for output to the terminal.

       In addition to arranging for various Encode aliases the following functions and variables are provided:

       decode_argv( )
       decode_argv( Encode::FB_CROAK )
           This will decode the command line arguments to perl (the @ARGV array) in-place.

           The  function  will  by  default  replace characters that can't be decoded by "\x{FFFD}", the Unicode
           replacement character.

           Any argument provided is passed as  CHECK  to  underlying  <b>Encode::decode()</b>  call.   Pass  the  value
           "Encode::FB_CROAK"  to  have the decoding croak if not all the command line arguments can be decoded.
           See "Handling Malformed Data" in Encode for details on other options for CHECK.

       env( $uni_key )
       env( $uni_key =&gt; $uni_value )
           Interface to get/set environment variables.  Returns the current  value  as  a  Unicode  string.  The
           $uni_key  and  $uni_value  arguments  are expected to be Unicode strings as well.  Passing "undef" as
           $uni_value deletes the environment variable named $uni_key.

           The returned value will have the characters that can't be decoded replaced by "\x{FFFD}", the Unicode
           replacement character.

           There is no interface to request alternative CHECK behavior as for <b>decode_argv()</b>.  If you  need  that
           you need to call encode/decode yourself.  For example:

               my $key = Encode::encode(locale =&gt; $uni_key, Encode::FB_CROAK);
               my $uni_value = Encode::decode(locale =&gt; $ENV{$key}, Encode::FB_CROAK);

       reinit( )
       reinit( $encoding )
           Reinitialize  the  encodings from the locale.  You want to call this function if you changed anything
           in the environment that might influence the locale.

           This function will croak if the determined encoding isn't recognized by the Encode module.

           With argument force $ENCODING_... variables to set to the given value.

       $ENCODING_LOCALE
           The encoding name determined to be suitable for the current locale.  Encode  know  this  encoding  as
           "locale".

       $ENCODING_LOCALE_FS
           The  encoding name determined to be suitable for file system interfaces involving file names.  Encode
           know this encoding as "locale_fs".

       $ENCODING_CONSOLE_IN
       $ENCODING_CONSOLE_OUT
           The encodings to be used for reading and  writing  output  to  the  a  console.   Encode  know  these
           encodings as "console_in" and "console_out".

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This table summarizes the mapping of the encodings set up by the "Encode::Locale" module:

         Encode      |         |              |
         Alias       | Windows | Mac OS X     | POSIX
         ------------+---------+--------------+------------
         locale      | ANSI    | nl_langinfo  | nl_langinfo
         locale_fs   | ANSI    | UTF-8        | nl_langinfo
         console_in  | OEM     | nl_langinfo  | nl_langinfo
         console_out | OEM     | nl_langinfo  | nl_langinfo

   <b>Windows</b>
       Windows  has basically 2 sets of APIs.  A wide API (based on passing UTF-16 strings) and a byte based API
       based a character set called ANSI.  The regular Perl interfaces to the OS currently only  uses  the  ANSI
       APIs.  Unfortunately ANSI is not a single character set.

       The  encoding  that  corresponds  to ANSI varies between different editions of Windows.  For many western
       editions of Windows ANSI corresponds  to  CP-1252  which  is  a  character  set  similar  to  ISO-8859-1.
       Conceptually  the  ANSI  character  set  is  a similar concept to the POSIX locale CODESET so this module
       figures out what the ANSI code page is and make this  available  as  $ENCODING_LOCALE  and  the  "locale"
       Encoding alias.

       Windows systems also operate with another byte based character set.  It's called the OEM code page.  This
       is  the encoding that the Console takes as input and output.  It's common for the OEM code page to differ
       from the ANSI code page.

   <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>X</b>
       On Mac OS X the file system encoding is always UTF-8 while the locale can otherwise be set up  as  normal
       for POSIX systems.

       File  names  on Mac OS X will at the OS-level be converted to NFD-form.  A file created by passing a NFC-
       filename will come in NFD-form from <b>readdir()</b>.  See Unicode::Normalize for details of NFD/NFC.

       Actually, Apple does not follow the Unicode NFD standard since not all character ranges  are  decomposed.
       The  claim  is  that  this  avoids problems with round trip conversions from old Mac text encodings.  See
       Encode::UTF8Mac for details.

   <b>POSIX</b> <b>(Linux</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>Unixes)</b>
       File systems might vary in what encoding is to be used for filenames.  Since this module has  no  way  to
       actually  figure  out  what  the  is correct it goes with the best guess which is to assume filenames are
       encoding according to the current locale.  Users are advised  to  always  specify  UTF-8  as  the  locale
       charset.
