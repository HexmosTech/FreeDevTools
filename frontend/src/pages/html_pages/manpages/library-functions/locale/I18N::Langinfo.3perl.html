       I18N::Langinfo - query locale information

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use I18N::Langinfo;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>langinfo()</b> function queries various locale information that can be used to localize output and user
       interfaces.  It uses the current underlying locale, regardless of whether or not it was called from
       within the scope of "use locale".  The <b>langinfo()</b> function requires one numeric argument that identifies
       the locale constant to query: if no argument is supplied, $_ is used.  The numeric constants appropriate
       to be used as arguments are exportable from I18N::Langinfo.

       The following example will import the <b>langinfo()</b> function itself and three constants to be used as
       arguments to <b>langinfo()</b>: a constant for the abbreviated first day of the week (the numbering starts from
       Sunday = 1) and two more constants for the affirmative and negative answers for a yes/no question in the
       current locale.

           use I18N::Langinfo qw(langinfo ABDAY_1 YESSTR NOSTR);

           my ($abday_1, $yesstr, $nostr) =
               map { langinfo($_) } (ABDAY_1, YESSTR, NOSTR);

           print "$abday_1? [$yesstr/$nostr] ";

       In other words, in the "C" (or English) locale the above will probably print something like:

           Sun? [yes/no]

       but under a French locale

           dim? [oui/non]

       The usually available constants are as follows.

       •   For abbreviated and full length days of the week and months of the year:

               ABDAY_1 ABDAY_2 ABDAY_3 ABDAY_4 ABDAY_5 ABDAY_6 ABDAY_7
               ABMON_1 ABMON_2 ABMON_3 ABMON_4 ABMON_5 ABMON_6
               ABMON_7 ABMON_8 ABMON_9 ABMON_10 ABMON_11 ABMON_12
               DAY_1 DAY_2 DAY_3 DAY_4 DAY_5 DAY_6 DAY_7
               MON_1 MON_2 MON_3 MON_4 MON_5 MON_6
               MON_7 MON_8 MON_9 MON_10 MON_11 MON_12

       •   For the date-time, date, and time formats used by the <b>strftime()</b> function (see POSIX):

               D_T_FMT D_FMT T_FMT

       •   For the locales for which it makes sense to have ante meridiem and post meridiem time formats:

               AM_STR PM_STR T_FMT_AMPM

       •   For the character code set being used (such as "ISO8859-1", "cp850", "koi8-r", "sjis", "utf8", etc.):

               CODESET

       •   For the symbol or string of characters that indicates a number is a monetary value:

               CRNCYSTR

           An example is the dollar sign "$".  Some locales not associated with particular locations may have an
           empty  currency  string.  (The C locale is one.)  Otherwise, the return of this is always prefixed by
           one of these three characters:

           "-" indicates that in this locale, the string precedes the  numeric  value,  as  in  a  U.S.  locale:
               "$9.95".

           "+" indicates that in this locale, the string follows the numeric value, like "9.95USD".

           "." indicates that in this locale, the string replaces the radix character, like "9$95".

       •   For  the radix character used between the integer and the fractional part of decimal numbers, and the
           group separator  string  for  large-ish  floating  point  numbers  (yes,  these  are  redundant  with
           <b>POSIX::localeconv()</b>):

               RADIXCHAR THOUSEP

       •   For any alternate digits used in this locale besides the standard 0..9:

               ALT_DIGITS

           This  returns  a  sequence of alternate numeric reprsesentations for the numbers 0 ... up to 99.  The
           representations are returned in a single  string,  with  a  semi-colon  ";"  used  to  separated  the
           individual ones.

           Most locales don't have alternate digits, so the string will be empty.

           To access this data conveniently, you could do something like

            use I18N::Langinfo qw(langinfo ALT_DIGITS);
            my @alt_digits = split ';', langinfo(ALT_DIGITS);

           The  array  @alt_digits  will  contain 0 elements if the current locale doesn't have alternate digits
           specified for it.  Otherwise, it will have as  many  elements  as  the  locale  defines,  with  "[0]"
           containing  the  alternate  digit for zero; "[1]" for one; and so forth, up to potentially "[99]" for
           the alternate representation of ninety-nine.

           Be aware that the alternate representation in some locales for the numbers 0..9 will have  a  leading
           alternate-zero, so would look like the equivalent of 00..09.

           Running this program

            use I18N::Langinfo qw(langinfo ALT_DIGITS);
            my @alt_digits = split ';', langinfo(ALT_DIGITS);
            splice @alt_digits, 15;
            print join " ", @alt_digits, "\n";

           on a Japanese locale yields

           "〇 一 二 三 四 五 六 七 八 九 十 十一 十二 十三 十四"

           on some platforms.

       •   For the affirmative and negative responses and expressions:

               YESSTR YESEXPR NOSTR NOEXPR

       •   For  the  eras based on typically some ruler, such as the Japanese Emperor (naturally only defined in
           the appropriate locales):

               ERA ERA_D_FMT ERA_D_T_FMT ERA_T_FMT

       In addition, Linux boxes have extra items, as follows.  (When called from  other  platform  types,  these
       return a stub value, of not much use.)

       "_NL_ADDRESS_POSTAL_FMT"
       "_NL_ADDRESS_COUNTRY_NAME"
       "_NL_ADDRESS_COUNTRY_POST"
       "_NL_ADDRESS_COUNTRY_AB2"

       "_NL_ADDRESS_LANG_TERM"
       "_NL_ADDRESS_LANG_LIB"
           On  Linux  boxes,  these  return  information  about  the  country  for  the current locale.  Further
           information is found in <u>langinfo.h</u>

       "_NL_IDENTIFICATION_TITLE"
       "_NL_IDENTIFICATION_SOURCE"

       "_NL_IDENTIFICATION_REVISION"
       "_NL_IDENTIFICATION_DATE"
       "_NL_IDENTIFICATION_CATEGORY"
           On Linux boxes, these return meta information about the current locale, such as how to get  in  touch
           with its maintainers.  Further information is found in <u>langinfo.h</u>

       "_NL_MEASUREMENT_MEASUREMENT"
           On  Linux  boxes, it returns 1 if the metric system of measurement prevails in the locale; or 2 if US
           customary units prevail.

       "_NL_NAME_NAME_FMT"
       "_NL_NAME_NAME_GEN"
       "_NL_NAME_NAME_MR"
       "_NL_NAME_NAME_MRS"
       "_NL_NAME_NAME_MISS"
       "_NL_NAME_NAME_MS"
           On Linux boxes, these return information about how names are formatted and the  personal  salutations
           used in the current locale.  Further information is found in <b><a href="../man7/locale.7.html">locale</a></b>(7) and <u>langinfo.h</u>

       "_NL_PAPER_HEIGHT"
       "_NL_PAPER_WIDTH"
           On  Linux  boxes,  these  return the standard size of sheets of paper (in millimeters) in the current
           locale.

       "_NL_TELEPHONE_TEL_INT_FMT"
       "_NL_TELEPHONE_TEL_DOM_FMT"
       "_NL_TELEPHONE_INT_SELECT"
       "_NL_TELEPHONE_INT_PREFIX"
           On Linux boxes, these return information about how telephone numbers are formatted (both domestically
           and international calling) in the current locale.  Further information is found in <u>langinfo.h</u>

   <b>For</b> <b>systems</b> <b>without</b> <b>"nl_langinfo"</b>
       This module originally was just a wrapper for the libc  "nl_langinfo"  function,  and  did  not  work  on
       systems lacking it, such as Windows.

       Starting  in Perl 5.28, this module works on all platforms.  When "nl_langinfo" is not available, it uses
       various methods to construct what that function, if present,  would  return.   But  there  are  potential
       glitches.  These are the items that could be different:

       "ERA"
           Unimplemented, so returns "".

       "CODESET"
           This  should  work  properly  for  Windows  platforms.  On almost all other modern platforms, it will
           reliably return "UTF-8" if that is the code set.  Otherwise, it depends on  the  locale's  name.   If
           that  is of the form "foo.bar", it will assume "bar" is the code set; and it also knows about the two
           locales "C" and "POSIX".  If none of those apply it returns "".

       "YESEXPR"
       "YESSTR"
       "NOEXPR"
       "NOSTR"
           Only the values for English are returned.  "YESSTR" and "NOSTR" have been removed  from  POSIX  2008,
           and  are  retained  here  for backwards compatibility.  Your platform's "nl_langinfo" may not support
           them.

       "ALT_DIGITS"
           On systems with a <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3) that recognizes the POSIX-defined %O  format  modifier  (not  Windows),
           perl  tries  hard  to  return  these.   The result likely will go as high as what nl_langinfo() would
           return, but not necessarily; and the numbers from 0..9 will always be stripped of leading zeros.

           Without %O, an empty string is always returned.

       "D_FMT"
           Always evaluates to %x, the locale's appropriate date representation.

       "T_FMT"
           Always evaluates to %X, the locale's appropriate time representation.

       "D_T_FMT"
           Always evaluates to %c, the locale's appropriate date and time representation.

       "CRNCYSTR"
           The return may be incorrect for those rare locales where  the  currency  symbol  replaces  the  radix
           character.   If  you  have  examples  of  it  needing  to  work  differently, please file a report at
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.

       "ERA_D_FMT"
       "ERA_T_FMT"
       "ERA_D_T_FMT"
       "T_FMT_AMPM"
           These are derived by using strftime(), and not all versions of that function know about them.  ""  is
           returned for these on such systems.

       All "_NL_<u>foo</u>" items
           These  return  the  same values as they do on boxes that don't have the appropriate underlying locale
           categories.

       See your <b><a href="../man3/nl_langinfo.3.html">nl_langinfo</a></b>(3) for more information about the available constants.  (Often this means having  to
       look directly at the <u>langinfo.h</u> C header file.)

   <b>EXPORT</b>
       By default only the langinfo() function is exported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Before Perl 5.28, the returned values are unreliable for the "RADIXCHAR" and "THOUSEP" locale constants.

       Starting  in  5.28,  changing  locales  on threaded builds is supported on systems that offer thread-safe
       locale functions.  These include POSIX 2008 systems and Windows starting with  Visual  Studio  2005,  and
       this  module  will  work  properly  in  such situations.  However, on threaded builds on Windows prior to
       Visual Studio 2015, retrieving the items "CRNCYSTR" and "THOUSEP" can result in a race with a thread that
       has converted to use the global locale.  It is quite uncommon for a thread to have done this.   It  would
       be  possible  to  construct  a  workaround  for  this;  patches welcome: see "switch_to_global_locale" in
       perlapi.
