</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Locale::Po4a::Sgml - convert SGML documents from/to PO files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The po4a (PO for anything) project goal is to ease translations (and more interestingly, the maintenance
       of translations) using gettext tools on areas where they were not expected like documentation.

       Locale::Po4a::Sgml is a module to help the translation of documentation in the SGML format into other
       [human] languages.

       This module uses <b><a href="../man1/onsgmls.1.html">onsgmls</a></b>(1) to parse the SGML files. Make sure it is installed.  Also make sure that the
       DTD of the SGML files are installed in the system.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>ACCEPTED</b> <b>BY</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>MODULE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>debug</b>
           Space-separated  list  of keywords indicating which category of extra debug messages should be shown.
           Possible values are: "entities", "generic", "onsgml", "refs" and "tag".

       <b>verbose</b>
           Give more information about what's going on.

       <b>translate</b>
           Space-separated list of extra tags (beside the DTD provided ones) whose content should form an  extra
           msgid, i.e that should be translated.

       <b>section</b>
           Space-separated list of extra tags (beside the DTD provided ones) containing other tags, some of them
           being of category <b>translate</b>.

       <b>indent</b>
           Space-separated list of tags which increase the indentation level. This will affect the identation in
           the resulting document.

       <b>verbatim</b>
           The  layout  within  those  tags should not be changed. The paragraph won't get wrapped, and no extra
           indentation space or new line will be added for cosmetic purpose.

       <b>empty</b>
           Tags not needing to be closed.

       <b>ignore</b>
           Tags ignored and considered as plain char data by po4a. That is to say that they can be  part  of  an
           msgid.  For  example,  &lt;b&gt;  is  a  good candidate for this category since putting it in the <b>translate</b>
           section would create a msgids with only its content, (and it's ususally not a whole sentence),  which
           is bad.

       <b>attributes</b>
           A  space-separated  list  of attributes that need to be translated. You can specify the attributes by
           their name (for example, "lang"), but you can also prefix it with a tag hierarchy,  to  specify  that
           this   attribute  will  only  be  translated  when  it  is  into  the  specified  tag.  For  example:
           "&lt;bbb&gt;&lt;aaa&gt;lang" specifies that the lang attribute will only be translated if it  is  in  an  "&lt;aaa&gt;"
           tag, which is in a "&lt;bbb&gt;" tag.  The tag names are actually regular expressions so you can also write
           things  like  "&lt;aaa|bbb&gt;lang" to only translate "lang" attributes that are in an "&lt;aaa&gt;" or a "&lt;bbb&gt;"
           tag.

       <b>qualify</b>
           A space-separated list of attributes for which the translation must be  qualified  by  the  attribute
           name,  i.e.  the  text  extracted for the transalation will include both the attributes name and it's
           value. e.g. for a tag like "&lt;aaa lang_en="foo"&gt;"  translators  will  be  presented  with  the  string
           "lang_en="foo"".  Note that this also automatically adds the given attribute into the <b>attributes</b> list
           too.

       <b>force</b>
           Proceed even if the DTD is unknown or if <b>onsgmls</b> finds errors in the input file.

       <b>include-all</b>
           By default, msgids containing only one entity (like "&amp;version;") are  skipped  for  the  translators'
           comfort. Activating this option prevents this optimisation. It can be useful if the document contains
           a construction like "&lt;title&gt;&amp;Aacute;&lt;/title&gt;", even if I doubt such things to ever happen...

       <b>ignore-inclusion</b>
           Space-separated  list  of entities that won't be inlined.  Use this option with caution: it may cause
           <b>onsgmls</b> (used internally) to add tags and render the output document invalid.

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>MODULE</b></h4><pre>
       The result is perfect. I.e., the generated documents are exactly the same as the originals. But there are
       still some problems:

       • The error output of <b>onsgmls</b> is redirected to /dev/null by default, which is clearly bad. I  don't  know
         how to avoid that.

         The  problem  is  that I have to "protect" the conditional inclusions (i.e. the "&lt;! [ %foo [" and "]]&gt;"
         stuff) from <b>onsgmls</b>. Otherwise <b>onsgmls</b> eats them, and I don't know how to restore  them  in  the  final
         document. To prevent that, I rewrite them to "{PO4A-beg-foo}" and "{PO4A-end}".

         The problem with this is that the "{PO4A-end}" and such I add are invalid in the document (not in a &lt;p&gt;
         tag or so).

         If  you  want  to  view  the  <b>onsgmls</b>  output,  just  add  the  following to your command line (or po4a
         configuration line):

           -o debug=onsgmls

       • It does work only with the DebianDoc and DocBook DTD. Adding support for a new DTD should be very easy.
         The mechanism is the same for every DTD, you just have to give a list of the existing tags and some  of
         their characteristics.

         I agree, this needs some more documentation, but it is still considered as beta, and I hate to document
         stuff which may/will change.

       • Warning,  support  for  DTDs  is  quite  experimental.  I did not read any reference manual to find the
         definition of every tag. I did add tag definition to the module 'till it works  for  some  documents  I
         found  on the net. If your document use more tags than mine, it won't work. But as I said above, fixing
         that should be quite easy.

         I did test DocBook against the SAG (System Administrator Guide) only, but this document is  quite  big,
         and should use most of the DocBook specificities.

         For DebianDoc, I tested some of the manuals from the DDP, but not all yet.

       • In  case  of  file  inclusion,  string  reference  of  messages  in  PO  files  (i.e.  lines  like  "#:
         en/titletoc.sgml:9460") will be wrong.

         This is because I preprocess the file to protect the conditional inclusion (i.e. the "&lt;! [ %foo ["  and
         "]]&gt;"  stuff)  and  some  entities  (like "&amp;version;") from <b>onsgmls</b> because I want them verbatim to the
         generated document. For that, I make a temp copy of the input file and do all the  changes  I  want  to
         this before passing it to <b>onsgmls</b> for parsing.

         So  that  it works, I replace the entities asking for a file inclusion by the content of the given file
         (so that I can protect what needs to be in a subfile also). But nothing is done so far to  correct  the
         references (i.e., filename and line number) afterward. I'm not sure what the best thing to do is.
