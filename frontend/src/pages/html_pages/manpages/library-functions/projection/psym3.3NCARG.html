</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PWRZT - Draws the projections of character strings that are positioned in a plane parallel to one of the
       three coordinate planes.

       NOTE: At one time, a Threed routine called PSYM3 was supported.  It has long been considered obsolete.
       If you call PSYM3, you will get an error message telling you to use PWRZT instead and execution will be
       terminated.

       As nearly as we can determine, the statement

             CALL PSYM3 (U,V,W,ICHAR,ISIZE,IDIR,ITOP,IUP)

       may be replaced by the statements

             IF (IUP.EQ.2) CALL VECT3 (U,V,W)
             CALL PWRZT (U,V,W,ICHAR,1,ISIZE,IDIR,ITOP,0)

       (Old  manuals  seem  to indicate that the fifth argument in the call to PSYM3 may have been a real called
       SIZE, rather than an integer called ISIZE; it is not clear whether this was a misprint or not.)

       The function of PSYM3 was to plot a symbol at the projection of a particular point; this can now be  done
       with  PWRZT.   If  the  eighth argument in the second and following of a series of calls to PSYM3 had the
       value 2, straight-line segments were drawn connecting the projections of the points; this is better  done
       with  a  single  call  to CURVE3, or by calling FRST3 for the first point and VECT3 for each of the other
       points.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL PWRZT (U,V,W,CHRS,LCHRS,ISIZE,IDIR,ITOP,ICEN)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_pwrzt (float u, float v, float w, char *chrs, int lchrs,
       int isize, int idir, int itop, int icen)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       U,V,W       (input expressions of type REAL) are the U, V, and W coordinates of a point,  in  the  user's
                   3-space, relative to which the character string is to be positioned.

       CHRS        (an  input  constant  or variable of type CHARACTER) is the character string to be drawn.  It
                   may contain uppercase alphabetic characters, the digits 0 through  9,  and  a  small  set  of
                   "special"  characters (plus, minus, asterisk, slash, left and right parentheses, equals sign,
                   blank, comma, and period).  Other characters are treated as blanks.   (Note  especially  that
                   lowercase alphabetic characters are not available.)

       LCHRS       (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the number of characters in CHRS.

       ISIZE       (an  input  expression  of type INTEGER) specifies the character width to be used, defined in
                   terms of the width of  the  plotter  frame.   Because  projected  characters  vary  in  width
                   depending  on  just  where  they are placed within the box being viewed and the position from
                   which that box is viewed, ISIZE is interpreted as specifying the width of  a  character  when
                   that  character  is  positioned  and  viewed in such a way as to make it as large as it could
                   possibly be - when the character is on the near side of the box and in a plane  perpendicular
                   to the line of sight.  Specifically,

                       If  between  0 and 3, ISIZE is 1., 1.5, 2., or 3. times a standard width equal to 1/128th
                       of the screen width.

                       If greater than 3, ISIZE is the character width in  units  of  1/1024th  of  the  plotter
                       frame.

                   One third of the "width" referred to here is white space.  What ISIZE really specifies is the
                   distance between the centers of adjacent characters in a string.  Characters are digitized to
                   be 7/6 * ISIZE units high and 4/6 * ISIZE units wide, excluding white space.

       IDIR        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the direction in which the character string is to be
                   written, as follows:

                       1 = +U    -1 = -U

                       2 = +V    -2 = -V

                       3 = +W    -3 = -W

       ITOP        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the direction from the center of the first character
                   to  the  top  of  the first character; possible values of ITOP are the same as those of IDIR,
                   above.  ABS(ITOP) must not be equal to ABS(IDIR).

       ICEN        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the centering option, specifying  where  (U,V,W)  is
                   relative to the string written, as follows:

                   -1  (U,V,W) is the center of the left edge of the first character.

                    0  (U,V,W) is the center of the entire string.

                    1  (U,V,W) is the center of the right edge of the last character.

       Because  characters  drawn  by  PWRZT  are  stroked using the GKS polyline primitive (so that they can be
       projected from 3-D to 2-D), they are drawn in the current polyline color, as determined by the last  call
       to  the  GKS routine GSPLCI; by default, color index 1 is used. Line width is determined by the last call
       to the GKS routine GSLWSC; by default, the line width scale factor is 1.
