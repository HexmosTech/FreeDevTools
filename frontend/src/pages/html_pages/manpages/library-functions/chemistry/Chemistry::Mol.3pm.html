</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Chemistry::Mol - Molecule object toolkit

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Chemistry::Mol;

           $mol = Chemistry::Mol-&gt;new(id =&gt; "mol_id", name =&gt; "my molecule");
           $c = $mol-&gt;new_atom(symbol =&gt; "C", coords =&gt; [0,0,0]);
           $o = $mol-&gt;new_atom(symbol =&gt; "O", coords =&gt; [0,0,1.23]);
           $mol-&gt;new_bond(atoms =&gt; [$c, $o], order =&gt; 3);

           print $mol-&gt;print;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package, along with Chemistry::Atom and Chemistry::Bond, includes basic objects and methods to
       describe molecules.

       The core methods try not to enforce a particular convention.  This means that only a minimal set of
       attributes is provided by default, and some attributes have very loosely defined meaning. This is because
       each program and file type has different idea of what each concept (such as bond and atom type) means.
       Bonds are defined as a list of atoms (typically two) with an arbitrary type.  Atoms are defined by a
       symbol and a Z, and may have 3D and internal coordinates (2D coming soon).

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       See also Chemistry::Obj for generic attributes.

       Chemistry::Mol-&gt;new(name =&gt; value, ...)
           Create a new Mol object with the specified attributes.

               $mol = Chemistry::Mol-&gt;new(id =&gt; 'm123', name =&gt; 'my mol')

           is the same as

               Chemistry::Mol-&gt;new()
               $mol-&gt;id('m123')
               $mol-&gt;name('my mol')

       $mol-&gt;add_atom($atom, ...)
           Add one or more Atom objects to the molecule. Returns the last atom added.

       $mol-&gt;atom_class
           Returns  the  atom  class that a molecule or molecule class expects to use by default. Chemistry::Mol
           objects return "Chemistry::Atom", but subclasses will likely override this method.

       $mol-&gt;new_atom(name =&gt; value, ...)
           Shorthand for "$mol-&gt;add_atom($mol-&gt;atom_class-&gt;new(name =&gt; value, ...))".

       $mol-&gt;delete_atom($atom, ...)
           Deletes an atom from the molecule.  It  automatically  deletes  all  the  bonds  in  which  the  atom
           participates  as well. $atom should be a Chemistry::Atom reference. This method also accepts the atom
           index, but this use is deprecated (and buggy if multiple  indices  are  given,  unless  they  are  in
           descending order).

       $mol-&gt;add_bond($bond, ...)
           Add one or more Bond objects to the molecule. Returns the last bond added.

       $mol-&gt;bond_class
           Returns  the  bond  class that a molecule or molecule class expects to use by default. Chemistry::Mol
           objects return "Chemistry::Bond", but subclasses will likely override this method.

       $mol-&gt;new_bond(name =&gt; value, ...)
           Shorthand for "$mol-&gt;add_bond($mol-&gt;bond_class-&gt;new(name =&gt; value, ...))".

       $mol-&gt;delete_bond($bond, ...)
           Deletes a bond from the molecule. $bond should be a Chemistry::Bond object.

       $mol-&gt;by_id($id)
           Return the atom or bond object with the corresponding id.

       $mol-&gt;atoms($n1, ...)
           Returns the atoms with the given indices, or all by default.  Indices start from one, not from zero.

       $mol-&gt;atoms_by_name($name)
           Returns the atoms with the given name (treated as an anchored regular expression).

       $mol-&gt;sort_atoms($sub_ref)
           Sort the atoms in the molecule by using the comparison function  given  in  $sub_ref.  This  function
           should take two atoms as parameters and return -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the first atom should
           go  before,  same, or after the second atom. For example, to sort by atomic number, you could use the
           following:

               $mol-&gt;sort_atoms( sub { $_[0]-&gt;Z &lt;=&gt; $_[1]-&gt;Z } );

           Note that the atoms are passed as parameters and not as the package variables $a and $b like the core
           sort function does. This is because $mol-&gt;sort will likely be called  from  another  package  and  we
           don't want to play with another package's symbol table.

       $mol-&gt;bonds($n1, ...)
           Returns the bonds with the given indices, or all by default.  Indices start from one, not from zero.

       $mol-&gt;print(option =&gt; value...)
           Convert  the molecule to a string representation. If no options are given, a default YAML-like format
           is used (this may change in the future). Otherwise, the format  should  be  specified  by  using  the
           "format" option.

       $s = $mol-&gt;sprintf($format)
           Format interesting molecular information in a concise way, as specified by a printf-like format.

               %n - name
               %f - formula
               %f{formula with format} - (note: right braces within
                   the format should be escaped with a backslash)
               %s - SMILES representation
               %S - canonical SMILES representation
               %m - mass
               %8.3m - mass, formatted as %8.3f with core sprintf
               %q - formal charge
               %a - atom count
               %b - bond count
               %t - type
               %i - id
               %% - %

           For example, if you want just about everything:

               $mol-&gt;sprintf("%s - %n (%f). %a atoms, %b bonds; "
                   . "mass=%m; charge =%q; type=%t; id=%i");

           Note that you have to "use Chemistry::File::SMILES" before using %s or %S on "$mol-&gt;sprintf".

       $mol-&gt;printf($format)
           Same  as  "$mol-&gt;sprintf",  but  prints  to  standard output automatically.  Used for quick and dirty
           molecular information dumping.

       Chemistry::Mol-&gt;parse($string, option =&gt; value...)
           Parse the molecule encoded in $string. The format should be specified with the the  "format"  option;
           otherwise, it will be guessed.

       Chemistry::Mol-&gt;read($fname, option =&gt; value ...)
           Read  a  file  and  return a list of Mol objects, or croaks if there was a problem.  The type of file
           will be guessed if not specified via the "format" option.

           Note  that  only  registered  file  readers  will  be  used.  Readers   may   be   registered   using
           "register_format()";  modules  that  include  readers (such as Chemistry::File::PDB) usually register
           them automatically when they are loaded.

           Automatic decompression of gzipped files is supported if  the  Compress::Zlib  module  is  installed.
           Files  ending in .gz are assumed to be compressed; otherwise it is possible to force decompression by
           passing the gzip =&gt; 1 option (or no decompression with gzip =&gt; 0).

       $mol-&gt;write($fname, option =&gt; value ...)
           Write a molecule file, or croak if there was a problem. The type of  file  will  be  guessed  if  not
           specified via the "format" option.

           Note that only registered file formats will be used.

           Automatic gzip compression is supported if the IO::Zlib module is installed.  Files ending in .gz are
           assumed  to  be  compressed;  otherwise  it is possible to force compression by passing the gzip =&gt; 1
           option (or no compression with gzip =&gt; 0). Specific compression levels  between  2  (fastest)  and  9
           (most compressed) may also be used (e.g., gzip =&gt; 9).

       Chemistry::Mol-&gt;file($file, option =&gt; value ...)
           Create  a  Chemistry::File-derived  object  for reading or writing to a file.  The object can then be
           used to read the molecules or other information in the file.

           This has more flexibility than calling "Chemistry::Mol-&gt;read" when dealing with multi-molecule  files
           or  files  that  have higher structure or that have information that does not belong to the molecules
           themselves. For example, a reaction file may have a list of molecules, but also  general  information
           like  the  reaction  name, yield, etc. as well as the classification of the molecules as reactants or
           products. The exact information that is available will depend on the file reader class that is  being
           used. The following is a hypothetical example for reading MDL rxnfiles.

               # assuming this module existed...
               use Chemistry::File::Rxn;

               my $rxn = Chemistry::Mol-&gt;file('test.rxn');
               $rxn-&gt;read;
               $name      = $rxn-&gt;name;
               @reactants = $rxn-&gt;reactants; # mol objects
               @products  = $rxn-&gt;products;
               $yield     = $rxn-&gt;yield;     # a number

           Note   that   only   registered   file  readers  will  be  used.  Readers  may  be  registered  using
           <b>register_format()</b>; modules that include readers (such as Chemistry::File::PDB) usually register  them
           automatically.

       Chemistry::Mol-&gt;register_format($name, $ref)
           Register  a  file type. The identifier $name must be unique.  $ref is either a class name (a package)
           or an object that complies with the Chemistry::File interface (e.g., a subclass of  Chemistry::File).
           If $ref is omitted, the calling package is used automatically. More than one format can be registered
           at     a    time,    but    then    $ref    must    be    included    for    each    format    (e.g.,
           Chemistry::Mol-&gt;register_format(format1 =&gt; "package1", format2 =&gt; package2).

           The typical user doesn't have to care about this function. It is used automatically by molecule  file
           I/O modules.

       Chemistry::Mol-&gt;formats
           Returns a list of the file formats that have been installed by <b>register_format()</b>

       $mol-&gt;mass
           Return  the  molar  mass. This is just the sum of the masses of the atoms.  See Chemistry::Atom::mass
           for details such as the handling of isotopes.

       $mol-&gt;charge
           Return the charge of the molecule. By default it returns the sum of the formal charges of the  atoms.
           However, it is possible to set an arbitrary charge by calling "$mol-&gt;charge($new_charge)"

       $mol-&gt;formula_hash
           Returns a hash reference describing the molecular formula. For methane it would return { C =&gt; 1, H =&gt;
           4 }.

       $mol-&gt;formula($format)
           Returns  a  string  with  the  formula.  The format can be specified as a printf-like string with the
           control sequences specified in the Chemistry::File::Formula documentation.

       my $mol2 = $mol-&gt;clone;
           Makes a copy of a molecule. Note that this is a <b>deep</b> copy; if your molecule has a pointer to the rest
           of the universe, the entire universe will be cloned!

           By default, <b>clone()</b> uses Storable to copy the Perl data structure.  Clone  can  be  used  instead  by
           setting variable $Chemistry::Mol::clone_backend to "Clone" (default is "Storable"). The documentation
           of Storable claims Clone is less memory-intensive.

       my $mol2 = $mol-&gt;safe_clone;
           Like  clone,  it  makes  a deep copy of a molecule. The difference is that the copy is not "exact" in
           that new molecule and its atoms and bonds get assigned new IDs. This makes it safe to combine  cloned
           molecules. For example, this is an error:

               # XXX don't try this at home!
               my $mol2 = Chemistry::Mol-&gt;combine($mol1, $mol1);
               # the atoms in $mol1 will clash

           But this is ok:

               # the "safe clone" of $mol1 will have new IDs
               my $mol2 = Chemistry::Mol-&gt;combine($mol1, $mol1-&gt;safe_clone);

       ($distance, $atom_here, $atom_there) = $mol-&gt;distance($obj)
           Returns  the  minimum  distance  to  $obj,  which  can be an atom, a molecule, or a vector. In scalar
           context it returns only the distance; in list context it also returns the atoms involved. The current
           implementation for calculating the minimum distance between two  molecules  compares  every  possible
           pair of atoms, so it's not efficient for large molecules.

       my $bigmol = Chemistry::Mol-&gt;combine($mol1, $mol2, ...)
       $mol1-&gt;combine($mol2, $mol3, ...)
           Combines  several  molecules  in  one  bigger  molecule. If called as a class method, as in the first
           example, it returns a new combined molecule without altering any of the parameters. If called  as  an
           instance  method,  as in the second example, all molecules are combined into $mol1 (but $mol2, $mol3,
           ...) are not altered. <b>Note</b>: Make sure you don't combine molecules which contain atoms with  duplicate
           IDs (for example, if they were cloned).

       my @mols = $mol-&gt;separate
           Separates  a  molecule into "connected fragments". The original object is not modified; the fragments
           are clones of the original ones. Example: if you have ethane (H3CCH3) and you delete  the  C-C  bond,
           you have two CH3 radicals within one molecule object ($mol). When you call $mol-&gt;separate you get two
           molecules, each one with a CH3.

       $mol-&gt;sprout_hydrogens
           Convert  all  the  implicit  hydrogen  atoms in the molecule to explicit atoms.  It does <b>not</b> generate
           coordinates for the atoms.

       $mol-&gt;collapse_hydrogens
           Convert all the explicit hydrogen atoms in the molecule to implicit hydrogens.  (Exception:  hydrogen
           atoms that are adjacent to a hydrogen atom are not collapsed.)

       $mol-&gt;add_implicit_hydrogens
           Use  heuristics  to  figure  out how many implicit hydrogens should each atom in the molecule have to
           satisfy its normal "organic" valence.

       Chemistry::Mol-&gt;register_descriptor($name =&gt; $sub_ref)
           Adds a callback that can be used to add functionality to the molecule class (originally meant to  add
           custom  molecule  descriptors.)  A  descriptor is a function that takes a molecule object as its only
           argument and returns a value or values. For example, to add a descriptor function that  computes  the
           number of atoms:

               Chemistry::Mol-&gt;register_descriptor(
                   number_of_atoms =&gt; sub {
                       my $mol = shift;
                       return scalar $mol-&gt;atoms;
                   }
               );

           The descriptor is accessed by name via the "descriptor" instance method:

               my $n = $mol-&gt;descriptor('number_of_atoms');

       my $value = $mol-&gt;descriptor($descriptor_name)
           Calls  a  previously registered descriptor function giving it $mol as an argument, as shown above for
           "register_descriptor".
