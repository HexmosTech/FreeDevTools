       Date::Holidays::DE - Determine German holidays

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Date::Holidays::DE qw(holidays);
         my $feiertage_ref = holidays();
         my @feiertage     = @$feiertage_ref;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module exports a single function named <b>holidays()</b> which returns a list of German holidays in a given
       year.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>HOLIDAYS</b></h4><pre>
       The module knows about the following holidays:

         silv  Silvester                   New year's eve

       Please refer to the module source for detailed information about how every holiday is calculated. Too
       much detail would be far beyond the scope of this document, but it's not particularly hard once you've
       found the date for Easter.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b>
       The list returned by <b>holidays()</b> consists of UNIX-Style timestamps in seconds since The Epoch. You may
       pass a <b>strftime()</b> style format string to get the dates in any format you desire:

         my $feiertage_ref = holidays(FORMAT=&gt;"%d.%m.%Y");

       Here are a few examples to get you started:

         FORMAT=&gt;"%d.%m.%Y"              25.12.2001
         FORMAT=&gt;"%Y%m%d"                20011225
         FORMAT=&gt;"%a, %B %d"             Tuesday, December 25

       Please consult the manual page of <b>strftime()</b> for a complete list of available format definitions.

       There is, however, one "proprietary" extension to the formats of <b>strftime()</b>: The format definition <u>%#</u>
       will print the internal abbreviation used for each holiday.

         FORMAT=&gt;"%#:%d.%m"              wei1:25.12.

       As the module doesn't want to deal with i18n issues, you'll have to find your own way to translate the
       aliases into your local language. See the <u>example/feiertage.pl</u> script included in the distribution to get
       the idea. This was added in version 0.6.

   <b>LOCAL</b> <b>HOLIDAYS</b>
       The module also knows about different regulations throughout Germany.

       When calling <b>holidays()</b>, the resulting list by default contains the list of Germany-wide holidays.

       You can specify one ore more of the following federal states to get the list of holidays local to that
       state:

         bw  Baden-Wuerttemberg
         by  Freistaat Bayern
         be  Berlin
         bb  Brandenburg
         hb  Freie Hansestadt Bremen
         hh  Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg
         he  Hessen
         mv  Mecklenburg-Vorpommern
         ni  Niedersachsen
         nw  Nordrhein-Westfalen
         rp  Rheinland-Pfalz
         sl  Saarland
         sn  Freistaat Sachsen
         st  Sachsen-Anhalt
         sh  Schleswig-Holstein
         th  Freistaat Thueringen

       For example,

         my $feiertage_ref = holidays(WHERE=&gt;['by', 'bw']);

       returns the list of holidays local to Bayern or Baden-Wuerttemberg.

       To get the list of local holidays along with the default list of common German holidays, use the
       following:

         my $feiertage_ref = holidays(WHERE=&gt;['common', 'bw']);

       returns the list of common German holidays merged with the list of holidays specific to Baden-
       Wuerttemberg.

       You can also request a list containing all holidays this module knows about:

         my $feiertage_ref = holidays(WHERE=&gt;['all']);

       will return a list of all known holidays. This was added in version 0.6.

   <b>ADDITIONAL</b> <b>HOLIDAYS</b>
       There are a number of holidays that aren't really holidays, e.g. New Year's Eve and Christmas Eve. These
       aren't contained in the <u>common</u> set of holidays returned by the <b>holidays()</b> function. The aforementioned
       <u>silv</u> and <u>heil</u> are probably the most likely ones that you'll need. If you live in Koeln, you'll probably
       want to include <u>romo</u> and <u>fadi</u>, too. ;-)

       As if things weren't bad enough already, there even are Holidays that aren't valid in an entire state.
       This refers to <u>fron</u>, <u>alhe</u> and <u>mari</u> in particular.

       If you want one or several of them to appear in the output from <b>holidays()</b>, use the following:

         my $feiertage_ref = holidays(ADD=&gt;['heil', 'silv']);

   <b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>YEAR</b>
       By default, <b>holidays()</b> returns the holidays for the current year. Specify a year as follows:

         my $feiertage_ref = holidays(YEAR=&gt;2004);

   <b>HOLIDAYS</b> <b>ON</b> <b>WEEKENDS</b>
       By default, <b>holidays()</b> includes Holidays that occur on weekends in its listing.

       To disable this behaviour, set the <u>WEEKENDS</u> option to 0:

         my $feiertage_ref = holidays(WEEKENDS=&gt;0);

</pre><h4><b>COMPLETE</b> <b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Get all holidays for Germany and Bayern in 2004, count New Year's Eve and Christmas Eve as Holidays.
       Also, we live in a catholic region where Assumption day is a holiday, too. Exclude weekends and return
       the date list in human readable format:

         my $feiertage_ref = holidays( WHERE    =&gt; ['common', 'he'],
                                       FORMAT   =&gt; "%a, %d.%m.%Y",
                                       WEEKENDS =&gt; 0,
                                       YEAR     =&gt; 2004,
                                       ADD      =&gt; ['heil', 'silv', 'mari']);

</pre><h4><b>PREREQUISITES</b></h4><pre>
       Uses <b>Date::Calc</b> <b>5.0</b> for all calculations. Makes use of the <b>POSIX</b> and <b>Time::Local</b> modules from the
       standard Perl distribution.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>SUGGESTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If you run into a miscalculation, need some sort of feature or an additional holiday, or if you know of
       any new changes to our funky holiday situation, please drop the author a note.

       Patches are welcome. If you can, please fork the project on <u>github</u> to submit your change:

         <a href="http://github.com/mschmitt/Date-Holidays-DE">http://github.com/mschmitt/Date-Holidays-DE</a>

       <u>Tag</u> <u>der</u> <u>Deutschen</u> <u>Einheit</u> was moved from June 17th to October 3rd in 1990 and is therefore listed twice
       when calculating holidays for 1990. This is not a bug. Awareness for this was introduced in Version 1.1.

</pre><h4><b>OFFICIAL</b> <b>HOLIDAY</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       The German Federal Ministry of the Interior used to publish a comprehensive list of holiday dates. This
       does currently not appear to be the case.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Date::Calc</b> works with year, month and day numbers exclusively. Even though this module uses <b>Date::Calc</b>
       for all calculations, it represents the calculated holidays as UNIX timestamps (seconds since The Epoch)
       to allow for more flexible formatting. On Perl versions earlier than 5.12.0 (released 2010), this limits
       the range of years to work on to the years from 1972 to 2037.

       Historic regulations for <u>Buss-</u> <u>und</u> <u>Bettag</u> are still not implemented.

       <b>Date::Holidays::DE</b> is not configurable. Holiday changes don't come over night and a new module release
       can be rolled out within a single day.
