</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Zonemaster::Engine::Zone - Object representing a DNS zone

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $zone = Zonemaster::Engine::Zone-&gt;new({ name =&gt; 'nic.se' });
           my $packet = $zone-&gt;parent-&gt;query_one($zone-&gt;name, 'NS');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Objects of this class represent zones in DNS. As far as possible, test implementations should access
       information about zones via these objects. Doing so will provide lazy-loading of the information, well-
       defined methods in which the information is fetched, logging and the ability to do things like testing
       zones that have not yet been delegated.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTORS</b></h4><pre>
       new Construct a new instance.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       name
           A Zonemaster::Engine::DNSName object representing the name of the zone.

       parent
           A  Zonemaster::Engine::Zone  object for this domain's parent domain. As a special case, the root zone
           is considered to be its own parent (so look for that if you recurse up the tree).

       ns_names
           A reference to an array of Zonemaster::Engine::DNSName objects, holding the names of the  nameservers
           for the domain, as returned by the first responding nameserver in the glue list.

       ns  A reference to an array of Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver objects for the domain, built by taking the
           list  returned  from  <b>ns_names()</b> and looking up addresses for the names. One element will be added to
           this list for each unique name/IP pair. Names for which no addresses could be found will  not  be  in
           this list. The list is lazy-loading, so take care to only look at as many entries as you really need.
           There  are  zones with more than 20 nameserver, and looking up the addresses of them all can take som
           considerable time.

       glue_names
           A reference to a an array of Zonemaster::Engine::DNSName objects, holding the  names  of  this  zones
           nameservers as listed at the first responding nameserver of the parent zone.

       glue
           A reference to an array of Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver objects for the domain, built by taking the
           list  returned from <b>glue_names()</b> and looking up addresses for the names. One element will be added to
           this list for each unique name/IP pair. Names for which no addresses could be found will  not  be  in
           this  list.  In  this case, the list is lazy-loading, so take care to only look at as many entries as
           you really need. In case of undelegated tests and fake delegation the IP associated with name servers
           for    the    tested    zone    will    be    the     ones     set     by     users     (saved     in
           %Zonemaster::Engine::Recursor::fake_addresses_cache), instead of the ones found recursively.

       glue_addresses
           A  list  of Zonemaster::LDNS::RR::A and Zonemaster::LDNS::RR::AAAA records returned in the Additional
           section of an NS query to the first listed nameserver for the parent domain.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       query_one($name[, $type[, $flags]])
           Sends (or retrieves from cache) a query for the  given  name,  type  and  flags  sent  to  the  first
           nameserver   in   the   zone's  ns  list.  If  there  is  a  response,  it  will  be  returned  in  a
           Zonemaster::Engine::Packet object. If the type arguments is not given, it defaults  to  'A'.  If  the
           flags  are  not  given,  they  default to "class" IN and "dnssec", "usevc" and "recurse" according to
           configuration (which is by default off on all three).

       query_persistent($name[, $type[, $flags]])
           Identical to query_one, except that instead of returning  the  packet  from  the  first  server  that
           returns  one,  it  returns  the  first  packet  that actually contains a resource record matching the
           requested name and type.

       query_auth($name[, $type[, $flags]])
           Identical to query_one, except that instead of returning  the  packet  from  the  first  server  that
           returns one, it returns the first packet that has the AA flag set.

       query_all($name, $type, $flags)
           Sends  (or  retrieves  from  cache)  queries to all the nameservers listed in the zone's ns list, and
           returns  a  reference  to  an   array   with   the   responses.   The   responses   can   be   either
           Zonemaster::Engine::Packet objects or "undef" values. The arguments are the same as for query_one.

       is_in_zone($name)
           Returns  true  if  the  given name is in the zone, false if not. If it could not be determined with a
           sufficient degree of certainty if the name is in the zone or not, "undef" is returned.
