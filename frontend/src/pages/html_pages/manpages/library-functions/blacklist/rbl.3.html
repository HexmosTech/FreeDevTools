</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These functions are an interface to a facility to conduct Realtime Blacklist  (RBL)  queries  and  return
       their results.  RBLs are described in RFC5782.

       An  application first initializes the package by calling <b>rbl_init().</b>  The optional <u>mallocf</u> parameter is a
       caller-provided memory allocation function taking a pointer to a caller-provided  opaque  data  structure
       (the  <u>closure</u>  parameter)  and  a  number  of bytes to allocate.  If <u>mallocf</u> is not provided, the default
       system memory allocator function <b><a href="../man3/malloc.3.html">malloc</a>(3)</b> is used.  The optional <u>freef</u> parameter  specifies  a  matching
       caller-provided  memory deallocator function, taking a pointer to a caller-provided opaque data structure
       (the <u>closure</u> parameter) and a pointer to the memory to be  released.   If  <u>freef</u>  is  not  provided,  the
       default  system  memory  release  function  <b><a href="../man3/free.3.html">free</a>(3)</b>  is used.  A handle for future use of the initialized
       library instance is returned, or NULL on error and <u>errno</u> will  be  set  to  indicate  the  cause  of  the
       failure.

       The  <b>rbl_geterror()</b>  function  can  be used to poll the library for an error string that provides further
       description for the most recent failed operation.

       A call to <b>rbl_setdomain()</b> sets the RBL's base domain.  This specifies the "root" of  all  future  queries
       for  the  provided  <b>rbl</b>  handle  to <b>qroot.</b>  Future queries passed to this handle will be prepended to the
       string provided here.

       A query is initialized with a call to <b>rbl_query_start()</b> which takes an RBL library  handle  as  <b>rbl,</b>  the
       string  to  be  queried  as  <b>query,</b>  and  a  pointer  to a void pointer that will be updated to contain a
       reference to the initiated query as <b>qh.</b>

       A query previously started by <u>rbl_query_start()</u> can be canceled by calling <b>rbl_query_cancel(),</b> passing it
       an RBL library handle as <b>rbl</b> and a query handle as <b>qh</b> as previously returned when the query was started.

       A query previously started by  <u>rbl_query_start()</u>  can  be  polled  for  its  status  or  a  result  using
       <b>rbl_query_check(),</b>  passing it an RBL library handle as <b>rbl,</b> a query handle as <b>qh,</b> a pointer to a "struct
       timeval" ast <b>timeout</b> (which can be NULL if an infinite wait is acceptable), and a  pointer  to  a  32-bit
       integer  as  <b>res</b> into which any result will be returned (or it can be NULL if the caller doesn't actually
       want the result).  Results are in network  byte  order.   If  this  function  returns  RBL_STAT_FOUND  or
       RBL_STAT_NOTFOUND, the query is automatically canceled and need not be passed to <u>rbl_query_cancel().</u>

       The <b>rbl_settimeout()</b> function can be used to change the query timeout.  The default is ten seconds.

       If  it  is  useful  to  have the library periodically call a user-provided function as an indication that
       queries are still in progress, such a function can be registered with the <b>rbl_setdnscallback()</b>  function.
       The  function  provided should take a void context pointer as its sole argument.  <b>rbl_setcallbackctx()</b> is
       used to tell the library what context pointer should be used, and <b>rbl_setcallbackint()</b> is  used  to  tell
       the  library  what  frequency,  in seconds, should be used to call that callback function.  Each of these
       takes the corresponding RBL library handle as its first argument,  and  the  obvious  parameter  for  its
       second.

       By  default, the library will use the stock system resolver to conduct DNS queries.  If alternates should
       be used, these can be specified using the following functions:

       <b>rbl_dns_set_query_service()</b> sets a context pointer to the query service to be used, if any.  This will be
       passed as-is to the other DNS functions.  It returns its previous value.

       <b>rbl_dns_set_query_cancel()</b> sets a pointer to the function that should be called to cancel an open  query,
       and  should take the following parameters: a void pointer to the DNS query service to be used, and a void
       pointer to a query handle as previously returned by a call to  <u>rbl_dns_set_query_start().</u>   The  function
       should return one of the DNS result codes described below.

       <b>rbl_dns_set_query_start()</b>  sets  a pointer to the function that should be called to initiate a new query,
       and should take the following parameters: a void pointer to the DNS query  service  to  be  used,  a  DNS
       record type (e.g. T_TXT), a pointer to a string containing the query to be started, a pointer to a buffer
       into  which the reply should be written, the number of bytes available in that buffer, and a pointer to a
       void pointer that will be updated to contain a unique handle for that query once started.   The  function
       should return one of the DNS result codes described below.

       <b>rbl_dns_set_query_waitreply()</b> sets a pointer to the function that should be called to wait for a reply to
       an  open  query,  and should take the following parameters: a void pointer to the DNS query service to be
       used,  a  void  pointer  referencing  the  query  of  interest  as  previously  returned  by  a  call  to
       <u>rbl_dns_set_query_start(),</u>  a  pointer  to  a "struct timeval" structure indicating how long the function
       should wait for a reply (or NULL if infinite waiting is acceptable), a pointer to a "size_t" that will be
       updated to contain the size of the received reply, a pointer to an integer that  will  contain  an  error
       code if the query fails (can be NULL if that information is not interesting to the caller), and a pointer
       to  an  integer  that  will  contain  a  DNSSEC status indication (can be NULL if that information is not
       interesting to the caller).  The function should return one of the DNS result codes described below.

       <b>rbl_dns_set_init()</b> sets a pointer to the  function  that  should  be  called  when  it  is  necessary  to
       initialize  a  resolver.  The function should store a handle to the initialized resolver and return zero,
       or return non-zero if initialization could not be completed.   The  function  specified  here  is  called
       before the first call to the query start function (see above).

       <b>rbl_dns_set_close()</b>  sets  a  pointer  to  the  function  that  should  be called when it is necessary to
       terminate a resolver.  The function will receive a handle referencing the resolver to be terminated,  and
       should return zero on success or non-zero on failure.

       <b>rbl_dns_set_nslist()</b>  sets a pointer to the function that should be called when it is necessary to change
       the set of nameservers that are to be used to resolve RBL queries.  The function will  receive  a  handle
       referencing the active resolver and a string containing a comma-separated list of nameservers to use.  It
       should return zero on success and non-zero on failure.

       <b>rbl_dns_set_config()</b> sets a pointer to the function that should be called when it is necessary to provide
       arbitrary  configuration information to the resolver.  The function will receive a handle referencing the
       active resolver and a string containing the configuration.  It should return zero on success and non-zero
       on failure.

       <b>rbl_dns_set_trustanchor()</b> sets a pointer to the function that should be called when it  is  necessary  to
       provide trust anchor information (supporting DNSSEC) to the resolver.  The function will receive a handle
       referencing  the active resolver and a string containing the trust anchor data.  It should return zero on
       success and non-zero on failure.

       Calling <b>rbl_dns_init()</b> forces (re-)initialization of the resolver.  This essentially causes  the  library
       to call any initialization function defined by <b>rbl_dns_set_init().</b>

       When the library handle is no longer needed, it should be passed to <b>rbl_close().</b>

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       The following return codes, of type RBL_STAT, can be returned:

       <u>RBL_STAT_OK</u>
              successful completion

       <u>RBL_STAT_INVALID</u>
              operation failed because an invalid parameter was provided

       <u>RBL_STAT_DNSERROR</u>
              operation  could not be completed because of errors requesting or receiving a DNS reply; note that
              this does not include a successful reply that contains a "no record  found"  result,  which  is  a
              successful answer

       <u>RBL_STAT_NORESOURCE</u>
              a  caller-provided  buffer  was too small to complete the requested operation, or a memory or file
              descriptor allocation failed

       <u>RBL_STAT_NOTIMPLEMENT</u>
              an optional library feature was not selected at compilation time

       <u>RBL_STAT_FOUND</u>
              the requested record was found in the RBL

       <u>RBL_STAT_NOTFOUND</u>
              the requested record was not found in the RBL (but the query did complete)

       <u>RBL_STAT_NOREPLY</u>
              a call to <u>rbl_query_check()</u> timed out before a result could be returned

       <u>RBL_STAT_EXPIRED</u>
              the underlying resolver reported that the query expired; this is  included  to  support  resolvers
              that have an overall query timeout as well as a single wait timeout

</pre><h4><b>DNS</b> <b>RETURN</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       Any registered DNS functions should return one of the following result codes:

       <u>RBL_DNS_ERROR</u>
              An error occurred.  The cause of the error can be retrieved using <u>rbl_geterror().</u>

       <u>RBL_DNS_SUCCESS</u>
              The operation was successful.

       <u>RBL_DNS_REPLY</u>
              A reply is available (returned by the "waitreply" function).

       <u>RBL_DNS_NOREPLY</u>
              No  reply  was  received  by  the  time the query timeout was reached (returned by the "waitreply"
              function).

       <u>RBL_DNS_EXPIRED</u>
              The query expired completely (returned by  the  "waitreply"  function).   Some  resolvers  set  an
              overall  timeout for the query at start time in addition to one for each single wait request; this
              code indicates the former timeout expired.
