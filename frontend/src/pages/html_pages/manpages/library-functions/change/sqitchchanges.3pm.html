       sqitchchanges - Specifying changes for Sqitch

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Many Sqitch commands take change parameters as arguments. Depending on the command, they denote a
       specific change or, for commands which walk change history or the change plan (such as "sqitch log"), all
       changes which can be reached from that change. Most commands search the plan for the relevant change,
       though some, such as "sqitch revert" and "sqitch log", search the database for the change.

   <b>Change</b> <b>Names</b>
       A change name, such as that passed to "sqitch add" and written to the plan file, has a few limitations on
       the characters it may contain. The rules are:

       •   Must be at least one character.

       •   Must contain no blank characters.

       •   The first character may not be punctuation.

       •   Last letter may not be punctuation.

       •   Must not end in "~", "^", "/", "=", or "%" followed by digits.

       •   All other characters may be any UTF-8 character other than ":", "@", "#", and "\".

       Note that "_" (underscore) is never considered punctuation. Some examples of valid names:

       "foo"
       12
       "t"
       6
       "阱阪阬"
       "阱阪阬92"
       "foo/bar"
       "beta1"
       "foo_"
       "_foo"
       "v1.0-1b"
       "v1.2-1"
       "v1.2+1"
       "v1.2_1"

       Some examples of invalid names:

       "^foo"
       "foo^"
       "foo^6"
       "foo^666"
       %hi
       "hi!"
       "foo@bar"
       "foo:bar"
       "foo\bar"
       "+foo"
       "-foo"
       @foo

   <b>Tag</b> <b>Names</b>
       A tag name, such as that passed to "sqitch tag" and written to the plan file, adhere by the same rules as
       "Change  Names"  with  one additional limitation: tags must not contain a slash character ("/").  Example
       valid change name but invalid tag name:

       "foo/bar"

</pre><h4><b>Specifying</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       A change parameter names a change object. It uses what is  called  an  extended  SHA1  syntax.  Here  are
       various ways to spell change names:

       "&lt;change_name&gt;", e.g., "users_table"
           The name of a change itself, as it was added to the plan via "sqitch add".

       "@&lt;tag_name&gt;", e.g., @rc1
           The change as of the named tag. Tags can be added to the plan via "sqitch tag".

       "&lt;change_name&gt;@&lt;tag_name&gt;", e.g., "users_table@beta1"
           The  named  change  as  of  a  tag,  also  known as a tag-qualified change name. For change iteration
           commands (such as "sqitch log"), this means the instance of  a  change  with  that  name  before  the
           specified  tag.  For  dependency  parameters  (such as in "sqitch add"), this means any instance of a
           change just before that tag, or at any time after the tag.

       "&lt;sha1&gt;", e.g., "40763784148fa190d75bad036730ef44d1c2eac6"
           The change full SHA1 ID (40-byte hexadecimal string). In some cases, such as "sqitch add", the ID may
           refer to a change in another Sqitch project.

       "&lt;project&gt;:&lt;change_name&gt;", e.g., "mybase:users_table"
           The name of a change in a specific project. Non-SHA1 change parameters without a project  prefix  are
           assumed  to  belong  to  the current project. Most useful for declaring a dependency on a change from
           another project in "sqitch add".

       "&lt;project&gt;:@&lt;tag_name&gt;", e.g., "mybase:@rc1"
           The name of a tag in an the named project.

       "&lt;project&gt;:&lt;change_name&gt;@&lt;tag_name&gt;", e.g., "project:users_table@beta1"
           A tag-qualified named change in the named project.

       "&lt;project&gt;:&lt;sha1&gt;", e.g., "mybase:40763784148fa190d75bad036730ef44d1c2eac6"
           The full SHA1 ID from another project.  Probably  redundant,  since  the  SHA1  I  should  itself  be
           sufficient.  But  useful  for  declaring  dependencies in the current project so that "sqitch add" or
           "sqitch rework" will validate that the specified change is in the current project.

       @HEAD
       "HEAD"
           Special symbolic name for the last change in the plan.

       @ROOT
       "ROOT"
           Special symbolic name for the first change in the plan.

       "&lt;change&gt;^", e.g., "@HEAD^^", "@HEAD^3", "@beta^2"
           A suffix "^" to a symbolic or actual name means the change <u>prior</u> to that change.  Two  "^"s  indicate
           the  second prior change. Additional prior changes can be specified as "^&lt;n&gt;", where "&lt;n&gt;" represents
           the number of changes to go back.

       "&lt;change&gt;~", e.g., "@ROOT~", "@ROOT~~", "@bar~4"
           A suffix "~" to a symbolic or actual name means the change <u>after</u> that change. Two "~"s  indicate  the
           second  following  change.  Additional  following  changes  can  be  specified as "~&lt;n&gt;", where "&lt;n&gt;"
           represents the number of changes to go forward.
