</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::KGB::Change - a single file change

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $c = App::KGB::Change-&gt;new(
               { action =&gt; "M", prop_change =&gt; 1, path =&gt; "/there" } );

           print $c;

           my $c = App::KGB::Change-&gt;new("(M+)/there");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>App::KGB::Change</b> encapsulates a single path change from a given change set (or commit).

       <b>App::KGB::Change</b> overloads the "" operator in order to provide a default string representation of
       changes.

</pre><h4><b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>action</b> (<b>mandatory</b>)
           The action performed on the item. Possible values are:

           <b>M</b>   The path was modified.

           <b>A</b>   The path was added.

           <b>D</b>   The path was deleted.

           <b>R</b>   The path was replaced.

       path (<b>mandatory</b>)
           The path that was changed.

       prop_change
           Boolean. Indicated that some properties of the path, not the content were changed.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>(</b> <b>{</b> <u><b>initial</b></u> <u><b>values</b></u> <b>}</b> <b>)</b>
       More-or-less standard constructor.

       It can take a hashref with keys all the field names (See ).

       Or, it can take a single string, which is de-composed into components.

       See  for examples.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>as_string()</b>
           Return  a  string  representation  of  the  change. Used by the ""  overload. The resulting string is
           suitable for feeding the  constructor if needed.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       detect_common_dir("changes")
           Given an arrayref of changes (instances of APP::KGB::Change), detects the longest path that is common
           to all of them. All the changes' paths are trimmed from the common part.

           Example:

            foo/b
            foo/x
            foo/bar/a

           would return 'foo' and the paths would be trimmed to

            b
            x
            bar/a
