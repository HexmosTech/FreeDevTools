</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Changes between SVN::Web versions.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>

   <b>0.63,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Oct</b> <b>17,</b> <b>2012</b>
       •   More improvements to UTF8 handling graciously contributed by Vladimir Timofeev

   <b>0.62,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Oct</b> <b>10,</b> <b>2012</b>
       •   Updated psgi file, for some reason I regressed it.

       •   A  variety  of  fixes,  notably huge improvements to UTF8 handling graciously contributed by Vladimir
           Timofeev and diff output fixes

   <b>0.61,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Jun</b> <b>11,</b> <b>2012</b>
       •   Template fixes for RT48416

       •   RT24507 closed as the stand alone server was removed in favor of Plack.

       •   RT39707 closed as many perl SVN related issues were resolved elsewhere

       •   Included patch from RT32041 to authenticate to https

   <b>0.60,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Jun</b> <b>7,</b> <b>2012</b>
       •   Pulled out mod_perl1/2 and cgi, replaced with Plack. This probably broke lots of things.

       •   Changed to using Dist::Zilla with MakeMaker (due to .po issues with Module::Build)

       •   DAGOLDEN recommends using Alien::SVN as dependency, rather than SVN::Core, SVN::Client  and  SVN::Ra.
           This is because the SVN perl modules are not published to CPAN.

       •   Merged patch from rt26159

   <b>0.54,</b> <b>never</b> <b>released</b>
       •   Fix for RT35186, to make 'selected' compliant with XHTML

       •   Fix for RT37388, by Vladimir Timofeev

   <b>0.53,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Apr</b> <b>29,</b> <b>2007</b>
       •   Change  how  path's  are  encoded,  to work around new strictness in Template Toolkit's "uri" filter.
           SVN::Web now works with versions of TT &gt; 2.15.

       •   Adjust <u>t/timedate-format.t</u> to work correctly in non-English locales.   Fixes  rt#25435,  reported  by
           "<a href="mailto:ema_zep@libero.it">ema_zep@libero.it</a>".

   <b>0.52,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Jan</b> <b>22,</b> <b>2007</b>
       •   Belatedly  update the SVN::Web installation to note that Subversion 1.4.0 or above is now required to
           use SVN::Web.

   <b>0.51,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Jan</b> <b>15,</b> <b>2007</b>
       •   "reposparent" functionality was inadvertently broken in 0.50.  This release  fixes  that.   This  was
           rt#24377 reported by Christoph Buescher &lt;<a href="mailto:Christoph.Buescher@fiducia.de">Christoph.Buescher@fiducia.de</a>&gt;.

   <b>0.50,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Jan</b> <b>12,</b> <b>2007</b>
       •   SVN::Web  now  supports  accessing  repositories  that  are  <b>not</b>  on  the  same  host as the SVN::Web
           installation.  Repositories can be accessed using the <u>file:///</u>, <u>http://</u>, and <u>svn://</u> protocols.

       •   A mechanism for configuring which actions are available  on  each  page  has  been  introduced.   See
           "Action menu configuration" in SVN::Web for more.

       •   A  new  action, SVN::Web::Blame has been introduced.  This generates output that shows the Subversion
           annotation/blame information for a file.

       •   Diff output (from SVN::Web::Diff and SVN::Web::Revision) is now generated by Subversion, rather  than
           SVN::Web.   This  makes diff generation much faster, and much less memory intensive.  However, it has
           meant that the <u>context</u> option is no longer available.

           There are several small tweaks to the diff and revision output.

       •   Refactoring and rewriting has meant that Digest::MD5, Text::Diff, and Text::Diff::HTML are no  longer
           prequisites.

       •   A bug has been fixed in RSS generation.  The contents of the &lt;description&gt; element are now wrapped in
           CDATA markers to ensure that any embedded markup is preserved.

       •   There  is  now  support  for  keeping  localisation files in arbitrary directories, configured by the
           "language_dirs" configuration option.  This makes it simpler to maintain your own localisation  files
           outside  of  SVN::Web,  and  makes  it  easier  to  integrate  third  party actions in to an SVN::Web
           installation.

           See "Languages" in SVN::Web and SVN::Web::I18N for more details.

       •   The Template::Toolkit "log_msg" meta-filter has been replaced with a Template::Toolkit MACRO, defined
           in <b>_</b><u>log_msg</u>.  The effect is the same, but  this  approach  affords  more  flexibility  (e.g.,  having
           different log message filters per repository).

       •   The  log  template now supports rudimentary 'paging' through the log messages.  <u>Proper</u> paging support
           requires new functionality in Subversion.  Selecting the number of log messages to show per  page  is
           also more straightforward.

       •   SVN::Web::Revision  supports  a "max_diff_size" configuration option to cope with revisions which may
           generate huge diffs.

       •   The configuration file (<u>config.yaml</u>) must contain  a  "version"  key,  otherwise  a  fatal  error  is
           generated.

       •   Most extraneous whitespace is now removed from the templates when output is being produced.

       •   Documentation  bug rt#22282, reported by Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp &lt;<a href="mailto:sterling@hanenkamp.com">sterling@hanenkamp.com</a>&gt;, has been
           fixed.

   <b>0.49,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Aug</b> <b>23,</b> <b>2006</b>
       •   SVN::Web now properly supports Apache 2 / mod_perl 2.  In addition, the  test  suite  contains  tests
           that  work  under  Apache  2, and ensure that future changes should not introduce regressions in this
           functionality.

       •   File::Spec is now used when constructing filesystem paths, instead of  assuming  that  the  directory
           separator is <u>/</u>.  This should allow the use of native paths on Windows, e.g. <u>C:\path\to\svnweb</u>.

       •   A bug in the mod_perl handler meant that the [% script %] directive wasn't generating fully qualified
           links.   This  resulted  in  links  in  the RSS feed being relative.  This is now fixed.  Reported by
           Dietrich Streifert &lt;<a href="mailto:dietrich.streifert@visionet.de">dietrich.streifert@visionet.de</a>&gt;.

       •   When testing the generated <u>httpd.conf</u> includes an explicit "ServerName" directive, removing a warning
           on some hosts.  Reported in rt#20170 by &lt;<a href="mailto:fiajro@cy.ath.cx">fiajro@cy.ath.cx</a>&gt;.

       •   Set permissions on the temporary directories when  running  tests  as  root.   Otherwise  they  fail.
           Reported in rt#20170 by &lt;<a href="mailto:fiajro@cy.ath.cx">fiajro@cy.ath.cx</a>&gt;.

       •   Fix a bug encounted on Solaris.  <b>SVN::Core::time_from_cstring()</b> was returning negative numbers.

       •   The  questions  that  are  asked  when  running "perl Build.PL" can now be answered and/or skipped by
           passing command line options to <u>Build.PL</u>.  Run "perldoc Build.PL" for the documentation options.

       •   Paths to Apache modules are no longer hardcoded in <u>conf/httpd.tt</u>.  "apxs" is  used  to  retrieve  the
           value  of  the  Apache  library  directory.   In  addition,  the name of the mod_perl .so file is now
           configurable, as different systems call it different things.

       •   Included documentation on  using  SVN::Web  with  the  IIS  web  server.   Submitted  by  Tom  Hukins
           &lt;<a href="mailto:tom@eborcom.com">tom@eborcom.com</a>&gt; in rt#20341.

       •   A  bug in the author's testing environment meant that 0.48 shipped with templates that generated HTML
           that was not strictly valid.  This, and the templates, have been fixed.

   <b>0.48,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Jun</b> <b>28,</b> <b>2006</b>
       •   The interface localisation can now be selected.  The interface has always  been  localised,  but  the
           mechanism  for  choosing  it has been badly exposed.  SVN::Web now supports two configuration options
           ("languages" and "default_language") to specify the language selection.

           In addition, the available configured languages are also exposed through the ("trac") user interface,
           and the user can choose from the list of available localisation.  Their choice is saved in a cookie.

       •   Generation of RSS feeds is now done using a template, instead of  using  XML::RSS.   This  removes  a
           dependency  on XML:RSS, and should make it easier to customise the content of the RSS feed should you
           desire.

           This fixes rt#18169, reported by Mike Ellery &lt;<a href="mailto:mikee@s2technologies.com">mikee@s2technologies.com</a>&gt;.

       •   RSS feeds are now autodiscoverable in modern browsers.

       •   The formatting of timestamps is now configurable using "strftime"  in  POSIX.   You  can  choose  how
           timestamps  are  formatted,  and  they can be displayed in UTC (the Subversion default), the server's
           local timezone, or the timezone of your choice.  See "Time  and  date  formatting"  in  SVN::Web  for
           details.

           This fixes rt#18806, reported by Mike Ellery &lt;<a href="mailto:mikee@s2technologies.com">mikee@s2technologies.com</a>&gt;.

       •   Worked  around  a  bug  in Subversion where repository paths that were specified with a tailing slash
           would trigger an assertion.  This fixes rt#19273, reported by Michael Schwern &lt;<a href="mailto:MSCHWERN@cpan.org">MSCHWERN@cpan.org</a>&gt;.

       •   Fixed a bug where the "directory_umask" cache backend option  was  not  being  treated  as  an  octal
           number.  This fixes rt#19272, reported by Michael Schwern &lt;<a href="mailto:MSCHWERN@cpan.org">MSCHWERN@cpan.org</a>&gt;.

       •   The  SVN::Web::Revision action now show's the repository's youngest revision if no "rev" parameter is
           provided.

       •   Fixed a bug in SVN::Web::Revision.  Revisions that contain files that were copied from another  file,
           modified, and then committed will now be displayed properly instead of generating an error.

       •   The  documentation for SVN::Web includes an example configuration for Apache and FastCGI, contributed
           by Robert Spier &lt;<a href="mailto:rspier@pobox.com">rspier@pobox.com</a>&gt;.

       •   Made extensive changes to the test suite.  Include tests that exercise SVN::Web  when  running  under
           "svnweb-server",  as  a  CGI script, and as an Apache mod_perl1 handler.  These tests are optional --
           the installer is prompted at "perl Build.PL" time whether to run these  tests,  and  to  provide  the
           information the tests need (such as the port to run on).

   <b>0.47,</b> <b>released</b> <b>May</b> <b>6,</b> <b>2006</b>
       •   Implement  support  for  caching  the results of the actions, using any of the Cache::Cache family of
           modules.  In tests (see <u>t/benchmark.t</u>) this can yield a 20% or  greater  speed  benefit.   See  "Data
           cache" in SVN::Web for details of how to enable the cache and configure cache related options.

       •   Support Subversion repo directories and files that have spaces or other characters that should be URI
           escaped in their names.  Fixes rt#19093, reported by &lt;<a href="mailto:gbloice@gmail.com">gbloice@gmail.com</a>&gt;.

       •   Commented out the references to Template::Plugin::Clickable and Template::Plugin::Clickable::Email in
           the config file that is generated by "svnweb-install".  This stops log files filling up with warnings
           if they're not present.  The lines remain, commented out, as a suggestion for users.

       •   Improved   the   modperl2   support,  fixing  rt#19004,  rt#18437,  and  rt#18346  (Garrison  Hoffman
           &lt;<a href="mailto:garrison@codefix.net">garrison@codefix.net</a>&gt;, &lt;<a href="mailto:cpan@rickster.com">cpan@rickster.com</a>&gt;, Thomas Nagel &lt;<a href="mailto:me@thomasnagel.com">me@thomasnagel.com</a>&gt;).

   <b>0.46,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Mar</b> <b>9,</b> <b>2006</b>
       •   Fixed a bug in "svnweb-server".  The CGI module is now always used when running  under  this  server,
           instead  of  CGI::Fast.   This should fix problems if you are trying to use "svnweb-server" on a host
           with CGI::Fast installed.

   <b>0.45,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Mar</b> <b>8,</b> <b>2006</b>
       •   Fixed a bug that broke mod_perl support.

   <b>0.44,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Mar</b> <b>8,</b> <b>2006</b>
       •   When browsing the repository the <u>trac</u> templates now include age of the file, expressed  as  {seconds,
           minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years} since the file was last modified.

       •   The  "revision",  "log",  "view",  and  "rss"  actions  are  much  more conservative with memory when
           processing commits that changed a large number  of  files.   Fixes  rt#17359,  reported  by  Dietrich
           Streifert &lt;<a href="mailto:dietrich.streifert@visionet.de">dietrich.streifert@visionet.de</a>&gt;.

       •   Included  support  for  running  under  mod_perl2 as well as mod_perl1.  Fixes rt#17085 and rt#17350.
           Based on a patch from Garrison Hoffman &lt;<a href="mailto:garrison@codefix.net">garrison@codefix.net</a>&gt;.

       •   Fixed a bug when running under mod_perl -- the HTTP headers were not being sent.  Some browsers could
           cope  with  this,  others  just   displayed   the   raw   HTML.    Reported   by   Dominic   Mitchell
           &lt;<a href="mailto:dom@happygiraffe.net">dom@happygiraffe.net</a>&gt;.

       •   Entering  a  revision  number that does not exist will now generate a localised error message.  Fixes
           rt#17822, reported by &lt;<a href="mailto:gk5885@kickstyle.net">gk5885@kickstyle.net</a>&gt;

       •   The SVN::Web::Revision action will now not show diffs between file revisions if  either  revision  of
           the    file    has   a   non-text   MIME   type.    Fixes   rt#17625,   reported   by   Mike   Ellery
           &lt;<a href="mailto:mikee@s2technologies.com">mikee@s2technologies.com</a>&gt;.

       •   Fixed some bugs in "svnweb-server".  Option parsing works  properly,  fixing  rt#17347  (reported  by
           &lt;<a href="mailto:miyagawa@cpan.org">miyagawa@cpan.org</a>&gt;) and the "--net-server" option is now honoured.

       •   "svnweb-install" should now work if any directories in the install path contain regexp metacharacters
           in  the  filename.  Fixes rt#17282, reported by &lt;<a href="mailto:CORION@cpan.org">CORION@cpan.org</a>&gt;.  It also emits warnings if copying
           files or making directories during the install process fails, fixing rt#17283.

   <b>0.43,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Jan</b> <b>25,</b> <b>2006</b>
       •   Fix a syntax error in the config file generated by svnweb-install.

       •   Fix the instructions and code for running under mod_perl.

       •   When viewing an HTML diff, include a link to the plain text equivalent.

       •   Showing diffs when viewing a revision is now optional, but defaults to on.

       •   Require Exception::Class 1.22 or above.  Versions below lack the necessary caught() syntax.

       •   Improve the installation and configuration documentation.

       •   Include "svnweb-server", a simple web server to make  it  easier  for  people  to  get  started  with
           SVN::Web.

   <b>0.42,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Dec</b> <b>16,</b> <b>2005</b>
       •   Throw  exceptions  instead  of <b>die()</b>ing on almost all errors.  Catch the exceptions and generate much
           friendlier error messages.  Error messages are now easy to localise.

       •   When viewing a diff, the <u>trac</u> templates show the two revision numbers being compared, and  include  a
           link allowing the user to reverse the order of the diff.

       •   The  syntax  for specifying permitted actions, and the classes that implement them, has changed.  See
           UPDATING for more information.  This mechanism also  allows  for  easy  configuration  of  per-action
           options.

       •   A (partial) French localisation has been supplied by Cyril Brulebois.

       •   Any  "svn:externals"  properties  that  are  set  on  a  directory  are  now shown when browsing that
           directory.

       •   When viewing a file's revision log, you can now select two arbitrary revisions and get a diff showing
           the changes between those revisions.  Fixes rt#15813.

       •   If you only have one repository configured then the "list" action can be  configured  to  immediately
           redirect  to  browsing  that repository, saving the user from having to click through an intermediate
           page.  See SVN::Web::List for more information.

   <b>0.41,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Nov</b> <b>4,</b> <b>2005</b>
       •   Introduce a [% base_uri %] variable so templates can refer to files relative to  the  directory  that
           "svnweb-install" was run in.  Fix a hardcoded reference to my home directory in a template.

       •   Update some of the packaging files, which were out of date.

   <b>0.40,</b> <b>released</b> <b>Nov</b> <b>4,</b> <b>2005</b>
       •   Maintainership handed from Chia-ling Kao to Nik Clayton.

       •   Overhauled the templates, so the out-of-the-box experience is much nicer.

       •   Add a "view" action that shows the contents of a file, along with the most recent log message.

       •   More  customisation  options,  making it easier to add or remove actions from the list of things that
           SVN::Web is allowed to do.

       •   Added huge swathes of information to the documentation.  It should now be much easier for anyone else
           to contribute code and/or templates to SVN::Web.

       •   A fix for rt#12431.  URLs without trailing slashes are fixed.

       •   A mechanism to 'stack' Template Toolkit filters. You can easily run log messages through an arbitrary
           number of filters, without causing problems if one or more of the filters is not installed.

       •   Inline display of some content from the repository where appropriate (e.g., viewing  an  image  works
           properly).

       •   Fixed  a  bug that meant the results from the automated tests weren't valid. Fixed the bugs that this
           uncovered.

       •   Added tests to ensure that the generated HTML is valid.
