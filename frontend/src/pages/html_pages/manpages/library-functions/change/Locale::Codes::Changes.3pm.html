</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Locale::Codes::Changes - details changes to Locale::Codes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This describes the changes made to modules in the Locale-Codes distribution.  Major changes are marked
       with asterisks (*).  For the most part, all modules have remained backward compatible at every release,
       but occasionally a change is made which is backward incompatible. These are marked with an exclamation
       mark (!).

       As of 3.00, the codes are autogenerated from the standards. With each release, codes will be re-generated
       and tested to see if any code changed. Any time there are any changes to the codes, it will be flagged
       below with a change: NEW CODE(s).

       I intend to check for new codes four times a year (March, June, September, December). I will also try to
       respond to requests for a release due to changes made to the standards, so if a code changes that you
       use, feel free to contact me.  Based on my available time and the time until the next release is
       scheduled, I will try to do a release any time the standards change.

       Added code2names
            Also code2countrys, code2languages, etc.  This  allows  you  to  see  all  names  and  aliases  that
            correspond to a code.  My apologies for making 'countrys' to be the plural of 'country', but because
            these  modules  are  all  generated  from  a  template, I didn't want to put in an exception for the
            strange pluralization.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>3.62</b> <b>(2019-08-29</b> <b>sbeck)</b></h4><pre>
       NEW CODE(s)
       Fixed tests
           Tests were not working correctly since the previous version.  This is now fixed.

       Fixed error messages
           Many of the error messages were inconsistent or completely wrong (due to cut-and-paste errors).  They
           have been fixed.

       Fixed some return codes
           The  name2code  and code2name functions returned 1 in the case of an error in some situations instead
           of undef (which was the documented value).

       Removed unnecessary dependencies
           A number of modules were included as test  dependencies  that  are  only  used  by  the  author  when
           preparing releases.  These have been removed as dependencies.  Petr Pisar on GitHub #11

       Removed travis file from the tarball
           The  tarball  had a .travis.yml file in it that wasn't in the MANIFEST file.  Since the MANIFEST file
           is automatically generated by the perl mkmanifest tool, since it didn't see the .travis.yml  file,  I
           have excluded it from the tarball.  Reported by Mohammad S Anwar on GitHub (#10)

       <b>(*)</b> <b>Deprecated</b> <b>in</b> <b>core</b>
           Because  correct  usage  of any of the Locale::Codes modules requires that they be kept up-to-date, I
           have long felt that it should not  be  distributed  as  a  core  module.   After  discussion  on  the
           perl5-porters  list,  it is agreed, and the deprecation process has been started.  Starting with perl
           5.28.0, Locale-Codes will be flagged as deprecated, and it will be removed in version 5.30.0 .

           Thanks to p5p-porters (especially Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsaker) for discussion and guidance.

       Changes from a github pull request applied
           A couple minor changes (updated .travis.yml to include newest versions of perl; and a couple  changes
           to pod_coverage.t) reported by lancew on GitHub.

       Got rid of Build.PL
           Simplified  things  by  only  supporting one of Makefile.PL/Build.PL (and the latter has been removed
           from perl core some time ago).  RT 123572

       Fixed INSTALLDIRS
           The behavior of installing core modules changed in 5.12 a bit, and Makefile.PL now reflects that.  RT
           123571

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>3.53</b> <b>(2017-07-25</b> <b>sbeck)</b></h4><pre>
       NEW CODE(s)
       Fixed the default error condition in legacy modules.
           With the addition of the OO module, better error handling was added (and it was on by default).   The
           non-OO  (legacy)  modules did not report errors, so code that uses them, would now behave differently
           if invalid data were passed in.

           I have turned off error handling by default in the legacy modules.  The show_errors method was  added
           to each of the non-OO modules to report errors if desired.

           Reported by dmaestro on GitHub.

       NEW CODE(s)
       Tests no longer require (.) in INC
           As of perl 5.25.11, (.) is being removed from INC.  I had to adjust the tests accordingly.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>3.50</b> <b>(2017-03-01</b> <b>sbeck)</b></h4><pre>
       NEW CODE(s)
       <b>(*)</b> <b>Rewrote</b> <b>as</b> <b>OO</b> <b>module</b>
           The  core  module  (Locale::Codes)  is  now an OO module that can be used directly.  All of the other
           modules (Locale::Codes::TYPE) are still the older functional interfaces and remain unchanged.

       <b>Added</b> <b>some</b> <b>constants</b>
           Historically, the constant names used to identify the codesets have been named  inconsistently.   The
           original constants for codesets are:

              Type      Constants

              country   LOCALE_CODE_*
              currency  LOCALE_CURR_*
              language  LOCALE_LANG_*

              script    LOCALE_SCRIPT_*
              langfam   LOCALE_LANGFAM_*
              langvar   LOCALE_LANGVAR_*
              langext   LOCALE_LANGEXT_*

           For consistencies sake, I have added some new codes (which are otherwise identical to the irregularly
           named codes):

              country   LOCALE_COUNTRY_*
              currency  LOCALE_CURRENCY_*
              language  LOCALE_LANGUAGE_*

           Going forward, all constants will include the full name of the code type.

       Non-OO modules are now generated
           All  non-OO  modules  are  now  automatically  generated.  This will make it easier to keep them 100%
           consistent as well as making it easier to add new types of code sets.

           All of the documentation for them is also generated except for the  description  of  the  code  sets.
           That has been moved into the Locale::Codes::Types document.

       Fixed a bug where constants were not exported
           Some  of  the  constants  for some of the newer code sets were not exported properly.  This was fixed
           when I started generating the non-OO modules, but was reported (after  I  had  already  fixed  it  in
           development) as RT 119741 .

       <b>Added</b> <b>GENC</b> <b>codes</b>
           The  GENC  codes  have  been  added.   These are the new US Government codes that replace the FIPS-10
           codes.  They are based on, but not identical to the ISO 3166 codes.

           As of June, the FIPS codes are not being published in their entirety.  Only changes to the codes  are
           published.   This  adds  a  huge layer of complexity to maintaining the set, which is not worth doing
           considering that the set is deprecated.  As such, the code set is no longer supported.

       <b>FIPS-10</b> <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> <b>deprecated</b>
           The FIPS-10 document is being withdrawn.  It was deprecated in 2008, and is being  updated  now  only
           until  all  the  agencies that use it have switched to something else.  The current version no longer
           lists the long names for countries.  These long names (such as 'Republic  of  Albania'  for  Albania)
           only  appeared  in  the  old  FIPS-10  document  which  is no longer available, so they are no longer
           available in this module.

           I will continue to support the FIPS-10 codeset as long as it is available, but at that point, it will
           be withdrawn immediately.  If an official end-of-life date is announced,  I  will  include  a  notice
           here.  Otherwise, support for the codeset will be discontinued when the document is withdrawn.

           You are encouraged to no longer use the FIPS-10 codeset.

           The  IANA  domain  codes  have  changed  slightly.   The IANA no longer publishes a list of countries
           associated with their codes.  Instead, they use the ISO 3166 codes and country names.  However,  they
           support  a few non-standard codes, so I will continue to maintain this codeset.  The domain codes are
           now lowercase to correspond to the ISO 3166 codes.

       <b>Codesets</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>specified</b> <b>by</b> <b>name</b>
           All codesets may be specified by a constant or by their name now.  Previously,  they  were  specified
           only by a constant.

       <b>alias_code</b> <b>deprecated</b>
           The   alias_code   function   exists   for   backward   compatibility.    It  has  been  replaced  by
           rename_country_code .  The alias_code function will be removed sometime after September, 2013 .

       <b>Code</b> <b>cleanup</b>
           All work is now done in the central module (Locale::Codes).  Previously, some was still done  in  the
           wrapper modules (Locale::Codes::*) but that is gone now.

       <b>Added</b> <b>LangFam</b> <b>module</b>

       NEW CODE(s)
       <b>Reorganized</b> <b>code</b>
           Moved support files into the Locale::Codes namespace.

           The work done in each of the Locale::XXX modules was virtually identical to each other.  It  has  all
           been moved to a central module and the Locale::XXX modules are now just wrappers.

       <b>(!)</b> <b>Changed</b> <b>XXX_code2code</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>slightly</b>
           In  previous  versions,  passing in the same code set for both code set arguments would automatically
           return undef. For example:

              country_code2code('bo',LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2);
                 =&gt; undef

           This doesn't seem like reasonable behavior, so it has been changed to allow the same code set:

              country_code2code('bo',LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2);
                 =&gt; 'bo'

           Note that if an invalid code is passed in, undef will still be returned:

              country_code2code('bol',LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2);
                 =&gt; undef

       <b>Added</b> <b>many</b> <b>semi-private</b> <b>routines</b>
           Previous versions had only two semi-private routines: rename_country and  alias_code  which  had  the
           ability  to  modify  the  internal  data  in  a  couple of very limited ways. It was requested (in an
           anonymous posting by someone named Steve and also by Steve Hay - unknown if they are the same  person
           or  two  different Steves) that better support for modifying internal data, so a full set of routines
           were added.

           The full set of routines includes:

              rename_country
              rename_language
              rename_currency
              rename_script

       <b>Fixed</b> <b>Makefile.PL</b> <b>and</b> <b>Build.PL</b>
           They now install as core modules as they are supposed to.  Reported in RT 54526

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>3.00</b> <b>(2010-02-10</b> <b>sbeck)</b></h4><pre>
       NEW CODE(s)
       <b>(*)</b> <b>New</b> <b>maintainer</b>
           From 1997 to 2004, Locale::Codes was maintained by Neil Bowers. Unfortunately, no updates  were  made
           from  June 2004 to January 2010. During that time, a number of changes were made to the standards, so
           the data included was out-of-date.

           I contacted Neil to get his permission to assume maintenance of the module, and he kindly agreed.

       <b>(*)</b> <b>(!)</b> <b>All</b> <b>codes</b> <b>are</b> <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> <b>standards</b>
           All of the values returned by the various functions are now values directly from the standards.  This
           means that the values returned in the 2.xx series are not necessarily the same as the values returned
           here.

           As  an example, the ISO 3166 standard which lists country codes refers to the country associated with
           the code "bo" as "Bolivia, Plurinational State of", so that is what is returned. In the 2.xx  series,
           "Bolivia" was returned.  Also, the country names vary from one standard to another. So the code "bol"
           which  is maintained by the United Nations returns the name of the country as "Bolivia (Plurinational
           State of)". Some common aliases have been added, so you can still request a code  associated  with  a
           county name "Bolivia".

           Since  the  data  comes  from  the  standards,  some  "incorrect" values are no longer supported. For
           example, 2.07 treated "Zaire" as an alias for "Congo", but the country changed it's name, and "Zaire"
           is not in the standard, so it has been dropped in 3.00.

       <b>Added</b> <b>new</b> <b>codeset(s)</b>
           FIPS 10 country codes (requested in RT 1755)

           Alpha-3 and Term language codes (requested in RT 11730)

           Numeric currency codes (requested in RT 18797)

       <b>(*)</b> <b>(!)</b> <b>Locale::Script</b> <b>changed</b>
           In 2.xx, Locale::Script assigned scripts to country codes, which is NOT how it is done  currently  in
           the  standards.  It  appears  that an older version of ISO 15924 did this, but I haven't found an old
           version to confirm that, and in any case, that is not the case in the current standards.

           As a result, the Locale::Script module is completely incompatible with the 2.xx version with  respect
           to the types of codes it supports. None of the old codes will work.

       <b>Added</b> <b>missing</b> <b>functions</b>
           I've  added  in some functions which were "missing" previously (since there was only one set of codes
           supported, the code2code functions didn't apply):

              language_code2code
              currency_code2code

           so the interfaces for each type of codes are consistent.

       <b>(!)</b> <b>Dropped</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>_alias_code</b>
           In Locale::Country, _alias_code was an allowed, but deprecated function which was  documented  to  be
           supported in the 2.xx series. I've removed it.

       <b>(!)</b> <b>All</b> <b>functions</b> <b>return</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>value</b>
           code2country  (and  other  equivalent functions) now returns the name of the country specified in the
           standard (if the different standards refer to the country by different variations in  the  name,  the
           results will differ based on the CODESET)

       <b>(!)</b> <b>rename_country</b> <b>function</b> <b>altered</b>
           The  rename_country function from 2.07 would guess the CODESET (unlike all other functions which used
           a default of LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2). The guess can cause problems since (with  the  addition  of  FIPS)
           codes  may  appear in different codesets for different countries. The behavior has been changed to be
           the same as other functions (default to LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2).

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>2.07</b> <b>(2004-06-10</b> <b>neilb)</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>2.05</b> <b>(2002-07-08</b> <b>neilb)</b></h4><pre>
           Added three letter codes for the countries that were missing them. Patch from TJ Mather.

           Documentation  bug: one of the examples used =&gt; where the lvalue was a constant, which isn't allowed,
           unless you put the () with the constant to force the right interpretation.  Pointed out by TJ  Mather
           and MYT.

           Updated the URL for the appendix in the CIA world factbook.  Patch from TJ Mather.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>2.04</b> <b>(2002-05-23</b> <b>neilb)</b></h4><pre>
           Updated  according  to  changes  in ISO 3166-1 described in ISO 3166-1 newsletters V-4 and V-5, dated
           2002-05-20:
              - Kazakstan is now "Kazakhstan"
              - Macau is now "Macao" The old names are retained as aliases.

           The alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes for East Timor have changed:
              tp -&gt; tl
              tmp -&gt; tls the numeric code stays 626. If you want to support the old codes, you can use the semi-
           private function <b>alias_code()</b>.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>2.03</b> <b>(2002-03-24</b> <b>neilb)</b></h4><pre>
           Fixed a typo in the alias for the Vatican, reported (with patch) by Philip Newton.

           Added "Moldova" as an alias for "Moldova, Republic of"

           Updated Makefile.PL to include AUTHOR and ABSTRACT

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>2.02</b> <b>(2002-03-09</b> <b>neilb)</b></h4><pre>
           Added semi-private routine <b>rename_country()</b> to Locale::Country, based on a patch from Iain Chalmers.

           Added test rename.t for the above function.

           Renamed _alias_code to be alias_code. Have retained the old name for  backwards  compatibility.  Will
           remove it when the major version number next changes.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>2.01</b> <b>(2002-02-18</b> <b>neilb)</b></h4><pre>
           Split the documentation for all modules into separate pod files.

           Made sure all =over were =over 4; some were other values.

           The <b>code2code()</b> methods had one more shift than was needed.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>2.00</b> <b>(2002-02-17</b> <b>neilb)</b></h4><pre>
           Created  Locale::Script  which  provides  an interface to the ISO codes for identification of scripts
           (writing scripts, rather than perl style scripts). The codes are  defined  by  ISO  15924,  which  is
           currently  in final draft.  Thanks to Jarkko for pointing out this new standard.  All three code sets
           are supported, and a test-suite added.

           Added support for country name variants to Locale::Country, so that
              country2code('USA')
              country2code('United States')
              country2code('United States of America') will all return 'us'.  This had been in  the  LIMITATIONS
           section  since the first version.  Patch from TJ Mather with additional variants from me. Added test-
           cases for these.

           Added VERSION to Locale::Constants. Thanks to Jarkko for pointing that it was missing.

           Should really have bumped major version with previous release, since there was a change to the API.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>1.06</b> <b>(2001-03-04</b> <b>neilb)</b></h4><pre>
           Added Locale::Constants, which defines three symbols for identifying which codeset is being used:

              LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2
              LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_3
              LOCALE_CODE_NUMERIC

           Updated Locale::Country to support all three code sets defined by ISO 3166.  This  was  requested  by
           Keith  Wall.   I  haven't  added  multiple codeset support to the other modules yet - I'll wait until
           someone asks for them.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>1.05</b> <b>(2001-02-13</b> <b>neilb)</b></h4><pre>
           Added Locale::Currency, contribution from Michael Hennecke.

           Added test suite for it (t/currency.t) and added test cases to t/all.t for the all_* functions.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>1.04</b> <b>(2000-12-21</b> <b>neilb)</b></h4><pre>
           Fixed very minor typos from 1.03!

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>1.03</b> <b>(2000-12-??</b> <b>neilb)</b></h4><pre>
           Updated Locale::Country:
              - fixed spelling of a few countries
              - added link to a relevant page from CIA world factbook

           Updated Locale::Language:
              - fixed typo in the documentation (ISO 939 should be 639)

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>1.02</b> <b>(2000-05-04</b> <b>neilb)</b></h4><pre>
           Updated Locale::Country and Locale::Language to reflect changes in the relevant ISO standards.  These
           mainly  reflect languages which are new to the relevant standard, and changes in the spelling of some
           country names.

           Added official URLs for the standards to the SEE ALSO sections of the doc for each module.

           Thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi for pointing me at the pages with latest versions of ISO 3166 and 639.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>1.00</b> <b>(1998-03-09</b> <b>neilb)</b></h4><pre>
           Added <b>Locale::Country::_alias_code()</b> so that 'uk' can be added as the code for "United  Kingdom",  if
           you want it.  This was prompted by Ed Jordan.

           Added  a  new  test  suite  for  handling  this case, and extended the existing test-suite to include
           testing of the case where 'uk' hasn't been defined as a valid code.
