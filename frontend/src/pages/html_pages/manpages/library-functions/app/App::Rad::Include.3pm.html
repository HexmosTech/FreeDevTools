</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Rad::Include - 'include' command extension for App::Rad

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.01

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       'include' is an opt-in command for you App::Rad programs (myapp.pl):

           use App::Rad qw(include);  # add the 'include' command
           App::Rad-&gt;run();

       and now you can turn your one-liners (e.g:)

           [user@host]$ perl -i -pe 's/\r//' file.txt

       into nice scalable commands, simply replacing 'perl' for 'yourapp include &lt;NAME&gt;'

           [user@host]$ myapp.pl include dos2unix -i -pe 's/\r//'

       and there you go, a brand new 'dos2unix' command:

           [user@host]$ myapp.pl dos2unix file.txt

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The one-liner conversion and beautification was *much* easened because of the nice "O" , "B::Deparse" and
       "Perl::Tidy" modules. So many thanks to Malcolm Beattie, Nicholas Clark, Stephen McCamant, Steve Hancock,
       and everyone that helped those projects.
