</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Rad::Help - 'help' command extension for App::Rad

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.02

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       you can add inline help for your App::Rad commands via "$c-&gt;register()" or "$c-&gt;register_commands()":

           use App::Rad;
           App::Rad-&gt;run();

           sub setup {
               my $c = shift;

               $c-&gt;register_commands( {
                       foo =&gt; 'expand your foo!',
                       bar =&gt; 'have a drink! arguments: --drink=DRINK',
                   });

               $c-&gt;register('baz', \&amp;baz, 'do your thing');
           }

       you can also do it with the attribute 'Help' in your subs

           sub my_command :Help(this is my command) {
               ...
           }

           sub another_cmd
           :Help(yet another command)
           {
               ...
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is an internal module for App::Rad and should not be used separately (unless, perhaps, you want to
