</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Rad::Plugin - Extend the App::Rad framework!

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This document is intended to help developers write their own App::Rad plugins. For specific usage on any
       given plugin, please refer to it's actual documentation.

</pre><h4><b>WARNING!</b></h4><pre>
       Since the plugin API is very new, there might be some changes in the future. Please drop me an email or
       RT wishlist if you feel something can be done to make plugin creation even better. Thanks!

</pre><h4><b>PLUGIN</b> <b>CREATION</b> <b>BASICS</b></h4><pre>
       Creating App::Rad plugins is very easy.

          package App::Rad::Plugin::MyPlugin;

       and create your subs as if they were methods of the App::Rad's $c variable.

          sub newmethod {
              my $c = shift;

              # ...
          }

       If a user invokes your plugin, she can use your new methods at any point in their program:

          use App::Rad  qw(MyPlugin);
          App::Rad-&gt;run();

          sub default {
              my $c = shift;

              $c-&gt;newmethod();    # this works!
          }

       you can also extend App::Rad's functionality by overriding methods, such as "getopt" or "config".

</pre><h4><b>CREATING</b> <b>INTERNAL</b> <b>(HELPER)</b> <b>SUBS</b></h4><pre>
       App::Rad will only import methods not starting with an underscore:

          package App::Rad::Plugin::YetAnother;

          sub something {
              my $c = shift;

              _internal( $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{somevalue} );
          }

          sub _internal {
              my $value = shift;
              #...
          }

       So you can safely create several internal subs for your plugin.

          use App::Rad  qw(YetAnother);

          sub default {
              my $c = shift;

              $c-&gt;something()    # this works!

              $c-&gt;_internal()    # this won't...
          }

</pre><h4><b>RESERVED</b> <b>SUB</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       Currently there are no reserved names for your plugin subs. However, they might be added in the future to
       be called on some predefined times in the App::Rad command workflow. Let me know if you feel this would
       improve your plugin's usability. Thanks!

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
