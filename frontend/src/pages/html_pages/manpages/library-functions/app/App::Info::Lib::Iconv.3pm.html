</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Info::Lib::Iconv - Information about libiconv

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use App::Info::Lib::Iconv;

         my $iconv = App::Info::Lib::Iconv-&gt;new;

         if ($iconv-&gt;installed) {
             print "App name: ", $iconv-&gt;name, "\n";
             print "Version:  ", $iconv-&gt;version, "\n";
             print "Bin dir:  ", $iconv-&gt;bin_dir, "\n";
         } else {
             print "libiconv is not installed. :-(\n";
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       App::Info::Lib::Iconv supplies information about the libiconv library installed on the local system. It
       implements all of the methods defined by App::Info::Lib. Methods that trigger events will trigger them
       only the first time they're called (See App::Info for documentation on handling events). To start over
       (after, say, someone has installed libiconv) construct a new App::Info::Lib::Iconv object to aggregate
       new meta data.

       Some of the methods trigger the same events. This is due to cross-calling of shared subroutines. However,
       any one event should be triggered no more than once. For example, although the info event "Searching for
       'iconv.h'" is documented for the methods "version()", "major_version()", and "minor_version()", rest
       assured that it will only be triggered once, by whichever of those four methods is called first.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructor</b>
       <u>new</u>

         my $iconv = App::Info::Lib::Iconv-&gt;new(@params);

       Returns an App::Info::Lib::Iconv object. See App::Info for a complete description of argument parameters.

       When called, "new()" searches the the list of directories returned by the "search_bin_dirs()" method for
       an executable file with a name returned by the "search_exe_names()" method. If the executable is found,
       libiconv will be assumed to be installed. Otherwise, most of the object methods will return "undef".

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Searching for iconv

       unknown
           Path to iconv executable?

       confirm
           Path to iconv executable?

   <b>Class</b> <b>Method</b>
       <u>key_name</u>

         my $key_name = App::Info::Lib::Iconv-&gt;key_name;

       Returns the unique key name that describes this class. The value returned is the string "libiconv".

   <b>Object</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <u>installed</u>

         print "libiconv is ", ($iconv-&gt;installed ? '' : 'not '),
           "installed.\n";

       Returns  true if libiconv is installed, and false if it is not.  App::Info::Lib::Iconv determines whether
       libiconv is installed based on the presence or absence of the <u>iconv</u> application, as  found  when  "new()"
       constructed  the  object.  If  libiconv  does  not  appear to be installed, then most of the other object
       methods will return empty values.

       <u>name</u>

         my $name = $iconv-&gt;name;

       Returns the name of the application. In this case, "name()" simply returns the string "libiconv".

       <u>version</u>

         my $version = $iconv-&gt;version;

       Returns the full version number for libiconv. App::Info::Lib::Iconv attempts to parse the version  number
       from the <u>iconv.h</u> file, if it exists.

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Searching for 'iconv.h'

           Searching for include directory

       error
           Cannot find include directory

           Cannot find 'iconv.h'

           Cannot parse version number from file 'iconv.h'

       unknown
           Enter a valid libiconv include directory

           Enter a valid libiconv version number

       <u>major_version</u>

         my $major_version = $iconv-&gt;major_version;

       Returns  the  libiconv  major  version number. App::Info::Lib::Iconv attempts to parse the version number
       from the <u>iconv.h</u> file, if it exists. For example, if "version()" returns "1.7", then this method  returns
       "1".

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Searching for 'iconv.h'

           Searching for include directory

       error
           Cannot find include directory

           Cannot find 'iconv.h'

           Cannot parse version number from file 'iconv.h'

       unknown
           Enter a valid libiconv include directory

           Enter a valid libiconv version number

       <u>minor_version</u>

         my $minor_version = $iconv-&gt;minor_version;

       Returns  the  libiconv  minor  version number. App::Info::Lib::Iconv attempts to parse the version number
       from the <u>iconv.h</u> file, if it exists. For example, if "version()" returns "1.7", then this method  returns
       "7".

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Searching for 'iconv.h'

           Searching for include directory

       error
           Cannot find include directory

           Cannot find 'iconv.h'

           Cannot parse version number from file 'iconv.h'

       unknown
           Enter a valid libiconv include directory

           Enter a valid libiconv version number

       <u>patch_version</u>

         my $patch_version = $iconv-&gt;patch_version;

       Since libiconv has no patch number in its version number, this method will always return false.

       <u>executable</u>

         my $executable = $iconv-&gt;executable;

       Returns  the  path  to  the  Iconv  executable,  which  will  be  defined by one of the names returned by
       "search_exe_names()". The executable is searched for in "new()", so there are no events for this method.

       <u>bin_dir</u>

         my $bin_dir = $iconv-&gt;bin_dir;

       Returns the path of the directory  in  which  the  <u>iconv</u>  application  was  found  when  the  object  was
       constructed by "new()".

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Searching for bin directory

       error
           Cannot find bin directory

       unknown
           Enter a valid libiconv bin directory

       <u>inc_dir</u>

         my $inc_dir = $iconv-&gt;inc_dir;

       Returns  the  directory  path  in  which  the file <u>iconv.h</u> was found.  App::Info::Lib::Iconv searches for
       <u>iconv.h</u> in the following directories:

       <a href="file:/usr/local/include">/usr/local/include</a>
       <a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a>
       /sw/include

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Searching for include directory

       error
           Cannot find include directory

       unknown
           Enter a valid libiconv include directory

       <u>lib_dir</u>

         my $lib_dir = $iconv-&gt;lib_dir;

       Returns the directory path in which a libiconv library was found. The search looks for a file with a name
       returned by "search_lib_names()" in a directory returned by "search_lib_dirs()".

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Searching for library directory

       error
           Cannot find library directory

       unknown
           Enter a valid libiconv library directory

       <u>so_lib_dir</u>

         my $so_lib_dir = $iconv-&gt;so_lib_dir;

       Returns the directory path in which a libiconv shared object library was found. The search  looks  for  a
       file with a name returned by "search_so_lib_names()" in a directory returned by "search_lib_dirs()".

       Returns  the  directory  path  in which a libiconv shared object library was found. App::Info::Lib::Iconv
       searches for these files:

       &lt;Events:&gt;

       info
           Searching for shared object library directory

       error
           Cannot find shared object library directory

       unknown
           Enter a valid libiconv shared object library directory

       <u>home_url</u>

         my $home_url = $iconv-&gt;home_url;

       Returns the libiconv home page URL.

       <u>download_url</u>

         my $download_url = $iconv-&gt;download_url;

       Returns the libiconv download URL.

       <u>search_exe_names</u>

         my @search_exe_names = $iconv-&gt;search_exe_names;

       Returns a list of possible names for the Iconv executable. By default, the only name  returned  is  <u>iconv</u>
       (<u>iconv.exe</u> on Win32).

       <u>search_bin_dirs</u>

         my @search_bin_dirs = $iconv-&gt;search_bin_dirs;

       Returns  a list of possible directories in which to search an executable. Used by the "new()" constructor
       to find an executable to execute and collect application info. The found directory will also be  returned
       by the "bin_dir" method. By default, the directories returned are those in your path, followed by these:

       <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:/bin">/bin</a></u>

       libiconv.dylib
       libiconv.0.dylib
       libiconv.0.0.1.dylib

       <u>search_lib_dirs</u>

         my @search_lib_dirs = $iconv-&gt;search_lib_dirs;

       Returns  a  list  of possible directories in which to search for libraries. By default, it returns all of
       the paths in the "libsdirs" and "loclibpth" attributes defined by the Perl Config module -- plus  <u>/sw/lib</u>
       (in support of all you Fink users out there).

       <u>search_inc_names</u>

         my @search_inc_names = $iconv-&gt;search_inc_names;

       Returns a list of include file names to search for. Used by "inc_dir()" to search for an include file. By

       search for an include file. By default, the directories are:

       <a href="file:/usr/local/include">/usr/local/include</a>
       <a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a>
       /sw/include

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       This is a pretty simple class. It's possible that there are more directories that ought  to  be  searched
       for libraries and includes.

</pre><h4><b>TO</b> <b>DO</b></h4><pre>
       Improve this class by borrowing code from Matt Seargent's AxKit <u>Makefil.PL</u>.
