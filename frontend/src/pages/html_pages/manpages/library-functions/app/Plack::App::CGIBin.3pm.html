       Plack::App::CGIBin - cgi-bin replacement for Plack servers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Plack::App::CGIBin;
         use Plack::Builder;

         my $app = Plack::App::CGIBin-&gt;new(root =&gt; "/path/to/cgi-bin")-&gt;to_app;
         builder {
             mount "/cgi-bin" =&gt; $app;
         };

         # Or from the command line
         plackup -MPlack::App::CGIBin -e 'Plack::App::CGIBin-&gt;new(root =&gt; "/path/to/cgi-bin")-&gt;to_app'

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Plack::App::CGIBin allows you to load CGI scripts from a directory and convert them into a PSGI
       application.

       This would give you the extreme easiness when you have bunch of old CGI scripts that is loaded using <u>cgi-</u>
       <u>bin</u> of Apache web server.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>IT</b> <b>WORKS</b></h4><pre>
       This application checks if a given file path is a perl script and if so, uses CGI::Compile to compile a
       CGI script into a sub (like ModPerl::Registry) and then run it as a persistent application using
       CGI::Emulate::PSGI.

       If the given file is not a perl script, it executes the script just like a normal CGI script with fork &amp;
       exec. This is like a normal web server mode and no performance benefit is achieved.

       The default mechanism to determine if a given file is a Perl script is as follows:

       •   Check if the filename ends with ".pl". If yes, it is a Perl script.

       •   Open  the  file  and  see  if  the  shebang  (first  line of the file) contains the word "perl" (like
           "#!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>"). If yes, it is a Perl script.

       You can customize this behavior by passing "exec_cb" callback, which takes  a  file  path  to  its  first
       argument.

       For  example,  if  your perl-based CGI script uses lots of global variables and such and are not ready to
       run on a persistent environment, you can do:

         my $app = Plack::App::CGIBin-&gt;new(
             root =&gt; "/path/to/cgi-bin",
             exec_cb =&gt; sub { 1 },
         )-&gt;to_app;

       to always force the execute option for any files.

       See also Plack::App::WrapCGI if you compile one CGI script into a PSGI application  without  serving  CGI
       scripts from a directory, to remove overhead of filesystem lookups, etc.
