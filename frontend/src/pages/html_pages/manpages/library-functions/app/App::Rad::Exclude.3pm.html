</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Rad::Exclude - 'exclude' command extension for App::Rad

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.01

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       'exclude' is an opt-in command for you App::Rad programs (myapp.pl):

           use App::Rad qw(exclude);  # add the 'exclude' command
           App::Rad-&gt;run();

           sub mycmd {
               print "hello, world\n";
           }

       and now you can permanently remove a command from your application

           [user@host]$ myapp.pl exclude mycmd

       Note that this <b>*will*</b> edit the program's source code and try to remove the command (subroutine)
       automatically, so use it with extreme caution.
