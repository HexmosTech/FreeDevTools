</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bread::Board::Container::Parameterized - A parameterized container

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.37

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class implements a sort of container factory for Bread::Board: a parameterized container is a, in
       practice, a function from a set of parameters (which must be containers) to an actual container. See
       Bread::Board::Manual::Example::FormSensible for an example.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"name"</b>
       Read/write string, required. Every container needs a name, by which it can be referenced when fetching
       it.

   <b>"allowed_parameter_names"</b>
       Read-only arrayref of strings, required. These are the names of the containers that must be passed to
       "create" to get an actual container out of this parameterized object.

   <b>"container"</b>
       This attribute holds the "prototype" container. Services inside it can depend on service paths that
       include the container names given in "allowed_parameter_names".

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"add_service"</b>
   <b>"get_service"</b>
   <b>"has_service"</b>
   <b>"get_service_list"</b>
   <b>"has_services"</b>
   <b>"add_sub_container"</b>
   <b>"get_sub_container"</b>
   <b>"has_sub_container"</b>
   <b>"get_sub_container_list"</b>
   <b>"has_sub_containers"</b>
       All these methods are delegated to the "prototype" "container", so that this object can be defined as if
       it were a normal container.

   <b>"create"</b>
         my $container = $parameterized_container-&gt;create(%params);

       After checking that the keys of %params are exactly the same strings that are present in
       "allowed_parameter_names", this method clones the prototype "container", adds the %params to the clone as
       sub-containers, and returns the clone.

       If this was not a top-level container, the parent is also cloned, and the container clone is added to the
       parent clone.

       Please note that the container returned by this method does <u>not</u> have the same name as the parameterized
       container, and that calling this method with different parameter values will return different containers,
       but all with the same name. It's probably a bad idea to instantiate a non-top-level parameterized
       container more than once.

   <b>"fetch"</b>
   <b>"resolve"</b>
       These two methods die, since services in a parameterized container won't usually resolve, and attempting
       to do so is almost always a mistake.
