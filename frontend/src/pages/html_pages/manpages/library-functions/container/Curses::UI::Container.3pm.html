       Curses::UI::Container - Create and manipulate container widgets

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>HIERARCHY</b></h4><pre>
        Curses::UI::Widget
           |
           +----Curses::UI::Container

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Curses::UI;
           my $cui = new Curses::UI;
           my $win = $cui-&gt;add('window_id', 'Window');

           my $container = $win-&gt;add(
               'mycontainer', 'Container'
           );

           $container-&gt;add(
               'contained', 'SomeWidget',
               .....
           );

           $container-&gt;focus();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A container provides an easy way of managing multiple widgets in a single "form". A lot of Curses::UI
       functionality is built around containers. The main class Curses::UI itself is a container. A
       Curses::UI::Window is a container. Some of the widgets are implemented as containers.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-parent</b>, <b>-x</b>, <b>-y</b>, <b>-width</b>, <b>-height</b>, <b>-pad</b>, <b>-padleft</b>, <b>-padright</b>, <b>-padtop</b>, <b>-padbottom</b>, <b>-ipad</b>, <b>-ipadleft</b>,
       <b>-ipadright</b>, <b>-ipadtop</b>, <b>-ipadbottom</b>, <b>-title</b>, <b>-titlefullwidth</b>, <b>-titlereverse</b>, <b>-onfocus</b>, <b>-onblur</b>

       For an explanation of these standard options, see Curses::UI::Widget.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       •   <b>-releasefocus</b>

           If  this  option  is set, the widgets inside this Container will be part of the focus ordering of the
           parent widget.  This means that when this Container gets the focus, its first widget will be focused.
           When the focus leaves the last widget inside the Container it will give the focus back to the  parent
           instead  of  cycling  back  to the first widget in this Container.  This option is useful to create a
           sub-class packed with common used widgets, making the reuse easier.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       •   <b>new</b> ( )

           Create a new instance of the Curses::UI::Container class.

       •   <b>add</b> ( ID, CLASS, OPTIONS )

           This is the main method for this class. Using this method it is easy to add widgets to the container.

           The ID is an identifier that you want to use for the added widget. This may be any string  you  want.
           If you do not need an ID, you may also us an undefined value. The container will automatically create
           an ID for you.

           The  CLASS  is  the  class  which you want to add to the container. If CLASS does not contain '::' or
           CLASS matches 'Dialog::...' then 'Curses::UI' will be prepended to it. This way you do  not  have  to
           specifiy the full class name for widgets that are in the Curses::UI hierarchy. It is not necessary to
           call  "use  CLASS"  yourself.  The  <b>add</b>  method  will  call  the  <b>usemodule</b> method from Curses::UI to
           automatically load the module.

           The hash OPTIONS contains the options that you want to pass on to the new instance of CLASS.

           Example:

               $container-&gt;add(
                   'myid',                   # ID
                   'Label',                  # CLASS
                   -text =&gt; 'Hello, world!', # OPTIONS
                   -x    =&gt; 10,
                   -y    =&gt; 5,
               );

       •   <b>delete</b> ( ID )

           This method deletes the contained widget with the given ID from the container.

       •   <b>hasa</b> ( CLASS )

           This method returns true if the container contains one or more widgets of the class CLASS.

       •   <b>layout</b> ( )

           Layout the Container and all its contained widgets.

       •   <b>draw</b> ( BOOLEAN )

           Draw the Container and all its contained widgets.
            If BOOLEAN is true, the screen will not update after drawing. By default this argument is false,  so
           the screen will update after drawing the container.

       •   <b>intellidraw</b> ( )

           See Curses::UI::Widget for an explanation of this method.

       •   <b>focus</b> ( )

           If  the  container contains no widgets, this routine will return immediately. Else the container will
           get focus.

           If the container gets focus, one of the contained widgets will get the focus. The returnvalue of this
           widget determines what has to be done next. Here are the possible cases:

           * The returnvalue is <b>LEAVE_CONTAINER</b>

             As soon as a widget returns this value, the container
             will loose its focus and return the returnvalue and the
             last pressed key to the caller.

           * The returnvalue is <b>STAY_AT_FOCUSPOSITION</b>

             The container will not loose focus and the focus will stay
             at the same widget of the container.

           * Any other returnvalue

             The focus will go to the next widget in the container.

       •   <b>getobj</b> ( ID )

           This method returns the object reference of the contained widget with the given ID.

       •   <b>getfocusobj</b> ( )

           This method returns the object reference of the contained widget which currently has the focus.

       •   <b>set_focusorder</b> ( IDLIST )

           Normally the order in which widgets get focused in a container is determined by the  order  in  which
           they  are  added  to  the  container.  Use <b>set_focusorder</b> if you want a different focus order. IDLIST
           contains a list of id's.

       •   <b>set_draworder</b> ( IDLIST )

           Normally the order in which widgets are drawn in a container is determined by the order in which they
           are added to the container. Use <b>set_draworder</b> if you want a different draw order. IDLIST  contains  a
           list of id's.

       •   <b>loadmodule</b> ( CLASS )

           This will load the module for the CLASS. If loading fails, the program will die.

       •   <b>onFocus</b> ( CODEREF )

           This  method  can  be  used to set the <b>-onfocus</b> event handler (see above) after initialization of the
           widget.

       •   <b>onBlur</b> ( CODEREF )

           This method can be used to set the <b>-onblur</b> event handler (see  above)  after  initialization  of  the
           widget.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Since  interacting  is not handled by the container itself, but by the contained widgets, this class does
       not have any key bindings.
