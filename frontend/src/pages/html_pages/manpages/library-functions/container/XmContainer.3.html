</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XmContainer</b> — The Container widget class "XmContainer" "container" "Container"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;Xm/Container.h&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Container  manages child widgets that have the <b>ContainerItem</b> trait.  These child widgets can be viewed in
       several different layout formats, selected using different selection types and techniques,  and  directly
       manipulated by the user.

       Three  different  formats  or  views  are  supported  by  the  Container.   They  are  specified  via the
       <b>XmNentryViewType</b> resource:

          •  <b>XmLARGE_ICON</b>

          •  <b>XmSMALL_ICON</b>

          •  <b>XmANY_ICON</b>

       Three different layout types are supported by the Container.  They are  specified  by  the  <b>XmNlayoutType</b>
       resource:

          •  <b>XmSPATIAL</b>

          •  <b>XmOUTLINE</b>

          •  <b>XmDETAIL</b>

       In   the  <b>XmSPATIAL</b>  layout  type,  several  other  resources  (<b>XmNspatialStyle</b>,  <b>XmNspatialIncludeModel</b>,
       <b>XmNspatialSnapModel</b>) control the positioning of the items within the Container; an application programmer
       can specify these resources so that the Container strictly enforces the position of each item or so  that
       the  Container  positions  items  according  to  constraint resources specified for each item.  The user,
       however, can alter the position of an item in the <b>XmSPATIAL</b> layout type within the  Container  by  direct
       manipulation;  for example, by pressing <b>BTransfer</b> over the item and then dragging and releasing <b>BTransfer</b>
       over some location within the Container.

       In the <b>XmOUTLINE</b> layout type, the Container controls the positioning  of  the  items.  Items  within  the
       Container  can  have  parent-child  relationships  between  them. Each item's <b>XmNentryParent</b> resource can
       specify another item in the same Container as its parent; items with a non-NULL value for  <b>XmNentryParent</b>
       can only be displayed in the <b>XmOUTLINE</b> layout type. In the <b>XmOUTLINE</b> layout type, items are positioned in
       a  tree  configuration with connecting lines drawn to illustrate the relationships.  Items are positioned
       top to bottom in the order specified by <b>XmNpositionIndex</b> within  their  parent.   Container  positions  a
       PushButton  next  to  each  item that has a parent relationship to other items. The PushButton contains a
       pixmap to illustrate whether the child items are shown or not; the user can activate  the  PushButton  to
       toggle  between showing or hiding the child items.  Direct manipulation to alter the position of the item
       is not supported in the <b>XmOUTLINE</b> layout type.  Note that the <b>XmNtraversalOn</b> resource of the  PushButtons
       created by Container are set to False.

       The  <b>XmDETAIL</b>  layout  type  is  the same as <b>XmOUTLINE</b>, except that each item can also display additional
       information as rows in columns with column headers specified in the <b>XmNdetailColumnHeading</b> resources.  In
       each item row, the item's detail information (see the reference page on <b>XmIconGadget</b> for a description of
       the  <b>XmNentryDetail</b>  resource) is displayed. Items are positioned top to bottom in the order specified by
       <b>XmNpositionIndex</b> within the parent.

   <b>Selection</b>
       When a child widget of the container is selected, the container specifies that the  item  should  display
       the  appropriate  visual information to the user via the <b>ContainerItem</b> trait.  The application program is
       notified of selection changes through <b>XmNselectionCallback</b>.

       The container uses four selection policies:

          •  Single

          •  Browse

          •  Multiple

          •  Extended

       In Single Select and Browse Select modes, only one item can be selected at a time. Pressing <b>BSelect</b> on an
       item selects it and deselects any other selected item.  Pressing <b>BSelect</b>  over  an  empty  space  in  the
       Container  deselects  all items. In Browse Select, dragging <b>BSelect</b> moves the selection as the pointer is
       moved.

       In Multiple Select and Extended Select modes, any number of items can be selected at the same  time.   In
       Multiple Select, pressing and dragging <b>BSelect</b> or <b>BExtend</b> to specify an item, range of items, or group of
       discontiguous  items  causes  the  selection  states  of  those  items to be toggled. In Extended Select,
       pressing and dragging <b>BSelect</b> to indicate an item, range  of  items,  or  group  of  discontiguous  items
       selects  those  items  and  deselects  all  others.  Pressing  and dragging <b>BExtend</b> in Extended Select to
       indicate an item, range of items, or discontiguous group of items causes the selection  states  of  those
       items to be toggled.

       Several  techniques are available to indicate an item, range of items, or group of discontiguous items in
       the Multiple Select and Extended Select modes.

       In the <b>XmSPATIAL</b> and <b>XmOUTLINE</b> layout types, the <b>XmNselectionTechnique</b> resource specifies the  techniques
       to  be used to indicate items. The default specification of <b>XmTOUCH_OVER</b> allows both the Random-Swipe and
       Marquee techniques to be used when <b>XmNlayoutStyle</b> is <b>XmSPATIAL</b>. The default specification of <b>XmTOUCH_OVER</b>
       allows the Range-Swipe, Range-Click, and Marquee techniques to be used when <b>XmNlayoutStyle</b> is <b>XmOUTLINE</b>.

       Discontiguous groups of items can be selected using the  Random-Swipe  technique.   In  the  Random-Swipe
       technique,  pressing  <b>BSelect</b> (or <b>BExtend</b>) over an item and dragging <b>BSelect</b> over other items selects all
       of those items. Only those items that pointer passed over are selected.

       In the Range-Swipe technique, the user presses <b>BSelect</b> (or <b>BExtend</b>) over  the  first  item  and  releases
       <b>BSelect</b>  over  the  last  item;  all  items within the range between the first and last item are selected
       whether the pointer actually passed over them or not.  In the Range-Click technique, the user presses and
       releases <b>BSelect</b> (or <b>BExtend</b>) over the first item and then presses and releases  <b>BExtend</b>  over  the  last
       item.

       In the Marquee technique, pressing <b>BSelect</b> (or <b>BExtend</b>) over a blank space within the Container indicates
       the  starting  point of a Marquee rectangle. Dragging <b>BSelect</b> draws a Marquee rectangle (rubberband line)
       between the starting point and current pointer. All items completely within  the  Marquee  rectangle  are
       selected.

       Specifying  <b>XmTOUCH_ONLY</b>  for <b>XmNselectionTechnique</b> enforces the Random-Swipe technique even when <b>BSelect</b>
       (or <b>BExtend</b>) is pressed over a  blank  space.   Similarly,  specifying  <b>XmMARQUEE</b>  enforces  the  Marquee
       technique  even  when  <b>BSelect</b>  (or <b>BExtend</b>) is pressed over an item; since the item over which the press
       occurs is only partially included in the Marquee rectangle, it is not  selected.   <b>XmMARQUEE_EXTEND_START</b>
       and  <b>XmMARQUEE_EXTEND_BOTH</b>  enforce  the  Marquee  technique  and  also  cause  the  rectangle  to extend
       automatically around the first item indicated and, for <b>XmMARQUEE_EXTEND_BOTH</b>, the last item.

       In the <b>XmDETAIL</b> layout type, the Range-Swipe and Range-Click techniques are available to indicate a range
       of items for selection.

       Container uses the <b>XmQTcontainerItem</b>, <b>XmQTscrollFrame</b>, and <b>XmQTspecifyRenderTable</b> traits  and  holds  the
       <b>XmQTcontainer</b> and <b>XmQTtransfer</b> traits.

   <b>Data</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Behavior</b>
       Container   supports   dragging   of  selected  items  from  the  widget.   Depending  on  the  value  of
       <b>XmNprimaryOwnership</b>, Container can also support primary selection.

       As a source of data, Container supports the following targets and associated conversions of data to these
       targets:

       <u>locale</u>    If the <u>locale</u> target matches the widget's locale, the widget transfers the  selected  items  in
                 the  encoding  of the locale.  The value for each item transferred, except the last, includes a
                 trailing separator.  Each item value is the <b>XmNlabelString</b> of the item.

       <b>COMPOUND_TEXT</b>
                 The widget transfers the selected items  as  type  <b>COMPOUND_TEXT</b>.   The  value  for  each  item
                 transferred,  except  the  last,  includes  a  trailing  separator.   Each  item  value  is the
                 <b>XmNlabelString</b> of the item.

       <b>DELETE</b>    The widget deletes the selected items.

       <b>PIXMAP</b>    The widget transfers a list of the pixmap IDs of the selected items as type <b>DRAWABLE</b>.

       <b>STRING</b>    The widget transfers the selected items as type <b>STRING</b>.  The value for each  item  transferred,
                 except  the  last, includes a trailing separator.  Each item value is the <b>XmNlabelString</b> of the
                 item.

       <b>TEXT</b>      If the selected items are fully convertible to the encoding of the locale, the widget transfers
                 the selected items in the encoding of the locale.  Otherwise, the widget transfers the selected
                 items as type <b>COMPOUND_TEXT</b>.  The value for each item transferred, except the last, includes  a
                 trailing separator.  Each item value is the <b>XmNlabelString</b> of the item.

       <b>_MOTIF_CLIPBOARD_TARGETS</b>
                 The  widget  transfers,  as type <b>ATOM</b>, a list of the targets it supports for immediate transfer
                 for the <b>CLIPBOARD</b> selection.  These include <b>_MOTIF_COMPOUND_STRING</b> and <b>PIXMAP</b>.  If the selected
                 items are fully convertible to <b>STRING</b>, these also include <b>STRING</b>; otherwise, they also  include
                 <b>COMPOUND_TEXT</b> and <b>UTF8_STRING</b>.

       <b>_MOTIF_COMPOUND_STRING</b>
                 The  widget transfers the selected items as a compound string in Byte Stream format.  The value
                 for each item transferred, except the last, includes a trailing separator.  Each item value  is
                 the <b>XmNlabelString</b> of the item.

       <b>UTF8_STRING</b>
                 The  widget  transfers  the  selected  items  as  type  <b>UTF8_STRING</b>.   The  value for each item
                 transferred, except  the  last,  includes  a  trailing  separator.   Each  item  value  is  the
                 <b>XmNlabelString</b> of the item.

       <b>_MOTIF_DEFERRED_CLIPBOARD_TARGETS</b>
                 The  widget transfers, as type <b>ATOM</b>, a list of the targets it supports for delayed transfer for
                 the   <b>CLIPBOARD</b>   selection.    This    widget    currently    supplies    no    targets    for
                 <b>_MOTIF_DEFERRED_CLIPBOARD_TARGETS</b>.

       <b>_MOTIF_DRAG_OFFSET</b>
                 The  widget  transfers  a  list of two 16-bit numbers, of type <b>INTEGER</b>, representing an x and y
                 offset for an item being dragged.  This offset is calculated so that, if the offset were  added
                 to the x and y coordinates at the drop site, and the dragged pixmap placed at that position, it
                 would  correspond  to  the position the user would expect the pixmap to placed at, based on the
                 drag icon used at the drop site.

       <b>_MOTIF_EXPORT_TARGETS</b>
                 The widget transfers, as type <b>ATOM</b>, a list of the targets to  be  used  as  the  value  of  the
                 DragContext's    <b>XmNexportTargets</b>    in    a    drag-and-drop    transfer.     These    include
                 <b>_MOTIF_COMPOUND_STRING</b>, <b>PIXMAP</b>, <b>COMPOUND_TEXT</b>,  the  encoding  of  the  locale,  <b>STRING</b>,  <b>TEXT</b>,
                 <b>BACKGROUND</b>, <b>FOREGROUND</b>, and <b>UTF8_STRING</b>.

       As a source of data, Container also supports the following standard Motif targets:

       <b>BACKGROUND</b>
                 The widget transfers <b>XmNbackground</b> as type <b>PIXEL</b>.

       <b>CLASS</b>     The  widget  finds  the  first  shell  in the widget hierarchy that has a <b>WM_CLASS</b> property and
                 transfers the contents as text in the current locale.

       <b>CLIENT_WINDOW</b>
                 The widget finds the first shell in the widget hierarchy  and  transfers  its  window  as  type
                 <b>WINDOW</b>.

       <b>COLORMAP</b>  The widget transfers <b>XmNcolormap</b> as type <b>COLORMAP</b>.

       <b>FOREGROUND</b>
                 The widget transfers <b>XmNforeground</b> as type <b>PIXEL</b>.

       <b>NAME</b>      The  widget  finds  the  first  shell  in  the widget hierarchy that has a <b>WM_NAME</b> property and
                 transfers the contents as text in the current locale.

       <b>TARGETS</b>   The widget transfers, as type <b>ATOM</b>, a list of the  targets  it  supports.   These  include  the
                 standard   targets   in   this   list.   These  also  include  <b>_MOTIF_COMPOUND_STRING</b>,  <b>PIXMAP</b>,
                 <b>COMPOUND_TEXT</b>, the encoding of the locale, <b>STRING</b>, <b>TEXT</b>, and <b>UTF8_STRING</b>.

       <b>TIMESTAMP</b> The widget transfers the timestamp used to acquire the selection as type <b>INTEGER</b>.

       <b>_MOTIF_RENDER_TABLE</b>
                 The widget transfers <b>XmNrenderTable</b> if it exists, or else the default  text  render  table,  as
                 type <b>STRING</b>.

       <b>_MOTIF_ENCODING_REGISTRY</b>
                 The  widget  transfers  its  encoding  registry  as  type  <b>STRING</b>.  The value is a list of NULL
                 separated items in the form of tag encoding pairs.  This target symbolizes the transfer  target
                 for  the  Motif  Segment  Encoding Registry.  Widgets and applications can use this Registry to
                 register text encoding formats for specified  render  table  tags.   Applications  access  this
                 Registry by calling <b>XmRegisterSegmentEncoding</b> and <b>XmMapSegmentEncoding</b>.

       As  a  destination  for  data,  Container supports only the dropping of items being dragged from the same
       widget.  Subclasses and  the  <b>XmNdestinationCallback</b>  procedures  are  responsible  for  any  other  data
       transfers to the widget.

   <b>Classes</b>
       Container  inherits  behavior,  resources, and traits from the <b>Core</b>, <b>Composite</b>, <b>Constraint</b>, and <b>XmManager</b>
       classes.

       The class pointer is <b>xmContainerWidgetClass</b>.

       The class name is <b>XmContainer</b>.

   <b>New</b> <b>Resources</b>
       The following table defines a set of widget resources  used  by  the  programmer  to  specify  data.  The
       programmer  can also set the resource values for the inherited classes to set attributes for this widget.
       To reference a resource by name or by class in a <b>.Xdefaults</b> file, remove the <b>XmN</b> or <b>XmC</b>  prefix  and  use
       the  remaining letters.  To specify one of the defined values for a resource in a <b>.Xdefaults</b> file, remove
       the <b>Xm</b> prefix and use  the  remaining  letters  (in  either  lowercase  or  uppercase,  but  include  any
       underscores between words). The codes in the access column indicate whether the given resource can be set
       at  creation  time  (C),  set  by  using  <b>XtSetValues</b>  (S), retrieved by using <b>XtGetValues</b> (G), or is not
       applicable (N/A).
