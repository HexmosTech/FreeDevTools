       Config::Model::models::Ssh::HostElement - Configuration class Ssh::HostElement

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration classes used by Config::Model

       This configuration class was generated from ssh_system documentation.  by parse-man.pl
       &lt;https://github.com/dod38fr/config-model-openssh/contrib/parse-man.pl&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Elements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>AddKeysToAgent</b>
       Specifies whether keys should be automatically added to a running ssh-agent1.  If this option is set to
       <b>yes</b> and a key is loaded from a file, the key and its passphrase are added to the agent with the default
       lifetime, as if by ssh-add1. If this option is set to <b>ask</b> <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) will require confirmation using the
       <b>SSH_ASKPASS</b> program before adding a key (see ssh-add1 for details). If this option is set to <b>confirm</b> each
       use of the key must be confirmed, as if the -<b>c</b> option was specified to ssh-add1. If this option is set to
       <b>no</b> no keys are added to the agent. Alternately, this option may be specified as a time interval using the
       format described in the <u>TIME</u> <u>FORMATS</u> section of sshd_config5 to specify the key's lifetime in ssh-agent1,
       after which it will automatically be removed. The argument must be <b>no</b> (the default), <b>yes</b> <b>confirm</b>
       (optionally followed by a time interval), <b>ask</b> or a time interval.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'ask',</u>
       <u>'confirm',</u> <u>'no',</u> <u>'yes'.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>AddressFamily</b>
       Specifies  which  address family to use when connecting. Valid arguments are <b>any</b> (the default), <b>inet</b> (use
       IPv4 only), or <b>inet6</b> (use IPv6 only).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'any',</u> <u>'inet',</u> <u>'inet6'.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           any

   <b>BatchMode</b>
       If set to <b>yes</b> user interaction such as password prompts  and  host  key  confirmation  requests  will  be
       disabled.  In  addition,  the  <b>ServerAliveInterval</b>  option will be set to 300 seconds by default (Debian-
       specific). This option is useful in scripts and other batch jobs where no user  is  present  to  interact
       with  <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1),  and where it is desirable to detect a broken network swiftly.  The argument must be <b>yes</b> or
       <b>no</b> (the default).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>BindAddress</b>
       Use the specified address on the local machine as the source address of the connection.  Only  useful  on
       systems with more than one address.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>BindInterface</b>
       Use  the address of the specified interface on the local machine as the source address of the connection.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>CanonicalDomains</b>
       When <b>CanonicalizeHostname</b> is enabled, this option specifies the list  of  domain  suffixes  in  which  to
       search for the specified destination host.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>CanonicalizeFallbackLocal</b>
       Specifies  whether  to  fail  with  an error when hostname canonicalization fails.  The default, <b>yes</b> will
       attempt to look up the unqualified hostname using the system resolver's search rules. A value of <b>no</b>  will
       cause <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) to fail instantly if <b>CanonicalizeHostname</b> is enabled and the target hostname cannot be found
       in any of the domains specified by <b>CanonicalDomains</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   <b>CanonicalizeHostname</b>
       Controls  whether  explicit hostname canonicalization is performed. The default, <b>no</b> is not to perform any
       name rewriting and let the system resolver  handle  all  hostname  lookups.  If  set  to  <b>yes</b>  then,  for
       connections  that do not use a <b>ProxyCommand</b> or <b>ProxyJump</b> <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) will attempt to canonicalize the hostname
       specified on the command line using the <b>CanonicalDomains</b> suffixes and <b>CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs</b>  rules.
       If <b>CanonicalizeHostname</b> is set to <b>always</b> then canonicalization is applied to proxied connections too.

       If  this option is enabled, then the configuration files are processed again using the new target name to
       pick up any new configuration in matching <b>Host</b> and <b>Match</b> stanzas. A value of <b>none</b> disables the use  of  a
       <b>ProxyJump</b> host.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'always',</u> <u>'no',</u> <u>'none',</u> <u>'yes'.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>CanonicalizeMaxDots</b>
       Specifies  the  maximum  number  of dot characters in a hostname before canonicalization is disabled. The
       default, 1, allows a single dot (i.e.  hostname.subdomain).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>integer.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           1

   <b>CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs</b>
       Specifies rules to determine whether CNAMEs should be followed when

       canonicalizing  hostnames.  The  rules  consist  of  one  or  more  arguments  of  <u>source_domain_list</u>   <u>:</u>
       <u>target_domain_list</u>  where  <u>source_domain_list</u>  is  a  pattern-list  of  domains that may follow CNAMEs in
       canonicalization, and <u>target_domain_list</u> is a pattern-list of domains that they may resolve to.

       For  example,  Qq  *.a.example.com:*.b.example.com,*.c.example.com  will  allow  hostnames  matching   Qq
       *.a.example.com to be canonicalized to names in the Qq *.b.example.com or Qq *.c.example.com domains.

       A  single argument of Qq none causes no CNAMEs to be considered for canonicalization. This is the default
       behaviour.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>CASignatureAlgorithms</b>
       Specifies which algorithms are allowed for signing of certificates by certificate authorities (CAs).  The
       default     is:     ssh-ed25519,     ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,    ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,    ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
       <a href="mailto:sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com">sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com</a>, <a href="mailto:sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com">sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com</a>, rsa-sha2-512, rsa-sha2-256

       If the specified list begins with a '+' character, then the specified algorithms will be appended to  the
       default  set  instead  of  replacing  them.  If  the specified list begins with a '-' character, then the
       specified algorithms (including wildcards) will be removed from the  default  set  instead  of  replacing
       them.

       <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1)  will  not accept host certificates signed using algorithms other than those specified.  <u>Optional.</u>
       <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>CertificateFile</b>
       Specifies a file from which the user's certificate is read. A corresponding private key must be  provided
       separately  in  order to use this certificate either from an <b>IdentityFile</b> directive or -<b>i</b> flag to <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1),
       via ssh-agent1, or via a <b>PKCS11Provider</b> or <b>SecurityKeyProvider</b>

       Arguments to <b>CertificateFile</b> may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's  home  directory,  the  tokens
       described  in  the  <u>TOKENS</u>  section  and  environment variables as described in the <u>ENVIRONMENT</u> <u>VARIABLES</u>
       section.

       It is possible to have multiple certificate files specified in configuration  files;  these  certificates
       will  be tried in sequence. Multiple <b>CertificateFile</b> directives will add to the list of certificates used
       for authentication.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ChannelTimeout</b>
       Specifies whether and how quickly <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) should close inactive channels.  Timeouts are specified  as  one
       or  more  ''type=interval'' pairs separated by whitespace, where the ''type'' must be the special keyword
       ''global'' or a channel type name from the list below, optionally containing wildcard characters.

       The timeout value ''interval'' is specified in seconds or may use any of the units documented in the <u>TIME</u>
       <u>FORMATS</u> section. For example, ''session=5m'' would cause interactive sessions  to  terminate  after  five
       minutes of inactivity.  Specifying a zero value disables the inactivity timeout.

       The  special  timeout  ''global''  applies to all active channels, taken together.  Traffic on any active
       channel will reset the timeout, but when the timeout expires then all open channels will be closed.  Note
       that this global timeout is not matched by wildcards and must be specified explicitly.

       The available channel type names include:

       <b>agent-connection</b>  Open  connections to ssh-agent1. <b>direct-tcpip</b> <b>,</b> <b><a href="mailto:direct-streamlocal@openssh.com">direct-streamlocal@openssh.com</a></b> Open TCP
       or Unix socket (respectively) connections that have been established from a <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) local forwarding, i.e.
       <b>LocalForward</b> or <b>DynamicForward</b> <b>forwarded-tcpip</b>  <b>,</b>  <b><a href="mailto:forwarded-streamlocal@openssh.com">forwarded-streamlocal@openssh.com</a></b>  Open  TCP  or  Unix
       socket (respectively) connections that have been established to a <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) listening on behalf of a <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1)
       remote  forwarding,  i.e.  <b>RemoteForward</b>  <b>session</b>  The interactive main session, including shell session,
       command execution, <b><a href="../man1/scp.1.html">scp</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/sftp.1.html">sftp</a></b>(1), etc. <b>tun-connection</b> Open <b>TunnelForward</b>  connections.   <b>x11-connection</b>
       Open X11 forwarding sessions.

       Note  that  in  all  the  above  cases,  terminating an inactive session does not guarantee to remove all
       resources associated with the session, e.g. shell processes or X11 clients relating to  the  session  may
       continue to execute.

       Moreover,  terminating  an inactive channel or session does not necessarily close the SSH connection, nor
       does it prevent a client from requesting another channel of the same type.  In  particular,  expiring  an
       inactive  forwarding  session  does  not  prevent  another  identical  forwarding from being subsequently
       created.

       The default is not to expire channels of any type for inactivity.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>CheckHostIP</b>
       If set to <b>yes</b> <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) will additionally check the host IP address in the known_hosts file. This allows  it
       to  detect  if  a  host  key  changed  due to DNS spoofing and will add addresses of destination hosts to
       <a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a> in the process, regardless of the setting of <b>StrictHostKeyChecking</b> If  the  option  is
       set to <b>no</b> (the default), the check will not be executed.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>Ciphers</b>
       Specifies the ciphers allowed and their order of preference. Multiple ciphers must be comma-separated. If
       the  specified  list  begins  with  a  '+'  character, then the specified ciphers will be appended to the
       default set instead of replacing them. If the specified list  begins  with  a  '-'  character,  then  the
       specified  ciphers  (including wildcards) will be removed from the default set instead of replacing them.
       If the specified list begins with a '^' character, then the specified ciphers will be placed at the  head
       of the default set.

       The  supported  ciphers  are:  3des-cbc aes128-cbc aes192-cbc aes256-cbc aes128-ctr aes192-ctr aes256-ctr
       <a href="mailto:aes128-gcm@openssh.comaes256-gcm">aes128-gcm@openssh.comaes256-gcm</a>@<a href="mailto:openssh.comchacha20-poly1305@openssh.com">openssh.comchacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</a>

       The    default     is:     <a href="mailto:chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com">chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</a>,     aes128-ctr,     aes192-ctr,     aes256-ctr,
       <a href="mailto:aes128-gcm@openssh.com">aes128-gcm@openssh.com</a>, <a href="mailto:aes256-gcm@openssh.com">aes256-gcm@openssh.com</a>

       The list of available ciphers may also be obtained using Qq ssh -Q cipher .  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ClearAllForwardings</b>
       Specifies that all local, remote, and dynamic port forwardings specified in the configuration files or on
       the  command  line  be cleared. This option is primarily useful when used from the <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) command line to
       clear port forwardings set in configuration files, and is automatically set by <b><a href="../man1/scp.1.html">scp</a></b>(1) and  <b><a href="../man1/sftp.1.html">sftp</a></b>(1).   The
       argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>Compression</b>
       Specifies  whether  to  use  compression.  The  argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>ConnectionAttempts</b>
       Specifies the number of tries (one per second) to make before exiting. The argument must be  an  integer.
       This  may  be  useful  in  scripts  if  the connection sometimes fails. The default is 1.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>integer.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           1

   <b>ConnectTimeout</b>
       Specifies the timeout (in seconds) used when connecting to the SSH server, instead of using  the  default
       system  TCP  timeout.  This  timeout is applied both to establishing the connection and to performing the
       initial SSH protocol handshake and key exchange. <b>SetupTimeOut</b> is a  Debian-specific  compatibility  alias
       for this option.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>integer.</u>

   <b>ControlMaster</b>
       Enables  the  sharing  of multiple sessions over a single network connection. When set to <b>yes</b> <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) will
       listen for connections on a control socket specified using the <b>ControlPath</b> argument. Additional  sessions
       can  connect  to this socket using the same <b>ControlPath</b> with <b>ControlMaster</b> set to <b>no</b> (the default). These
       sessions will try to reuse the master instance's network connection rather than initiating new ones,  but
       will fall back to connecting normally if the control socket does not exist, or is not listening.

       Setting  this  to <b>ask</b> will cause <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) to listen for control connections, but require confirmation using
       ssh-askpass1. If the <b>ControlPath</b> cannot be opened, <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) will continue without connecting  to  a  master
       instance.

       X11  and  ssh-agent1  forwarding is supported over these multiplexed connections, however the display and
       agent forwarded will be the one belonging to the master connection i.e. it is  not  possible  to  forward
       multiple displays or agents.

       Two additional options allow for opportunistic multiplexing: try to use a master connection but fall back
       to  creating  a  new  one  if  one does not already exist. These options are: <b>auto</b> and <b>autoask</b> The latter
       requires confirmation like the <b>ask</b> option.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'ask',</u> <u>'auto',</u> <u>'autoask',</u>  <u>'no',</u>
       <u>'yes'.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>ControlPath</b>
       Specify  the  path  to  the  control socket used for connection sharing as described in the <b>ControlMaster</b>
       section above or the string <b>none</b> to disable connection sharing. Arguments  to  <b>ControlPath</b>  may  use  the
       tilde  syntax  to  refer  to  a  user's  home  directory,  the tokens described in the <u>TOKENS</u> section and
       environment variables as described in the <u>ENVIRONMENT</u> <u>VARIABLES</u> section.   It  is  recommended  that  any
       <b>ControlPath</b>  used  for opportunistic connection sharing include at least %h, %p, and %r (or alternatively
       %C) and be placed in a directory  that  is  not  writable  by  other  users.  This  ensures  that  shared
       connections are uniquely identified.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ControlPersist</b>
       When  used  in  conjunction with <b>ControlMaster</b> specifies that the master connection should remain open in
       the background (waiting for future client connections) after  the  initial  client  connection  has  been
       closed.  If  set  to <b>no</b> (the default), then the master connection will not be placed into the background,
       and will close as soon as the initial client connection is closed.  If set to <b>yes</b> or 0, then  the  master
       connection will remain in the background indefinitely (until killed or closed via a mechanism such as the
       Qq  ssh  -O  exit  )  .  If  set  to  a  time  in  seconds, or a time in any of the formats documented in
       sshd_config5, then the backgrounded master connection will automatically terminate after it has  remained
       idle (with no client connections) for the specified time.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>DynamicForward</b>
       Specifies  that a TCP port on the local machine be forwarded over the secure channel, and the application
       protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.

       The argument must be [<u>bind_address</u> <u>:</u> <u>port</u> ] IPv6 addresses can be specified  by  enclosing  addresses  in
       square  brackets.  By  default,  the  local  port  is  bound in accordance with the <b>GatewayPorts</b> setting.
       However, an explicit <u>bind_address</u> may be  used  to  bind  the  connection  to  a  specific  address.  The
       <u>bind_address</u>  of  <b>localhost</b> indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an empty
       address or '*' indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces.

       Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) will act as a SOCKS server.  Multiple
       forwardings  may  be  specified,  and  additional  forwardings can be given on the command line. Only the
       superuser can forward privileged ports.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>EnableEscapeCommandline</b>
       Enables the command line option in the <b>EscapeChar</b> menu for interactive sessions  (default  '~C'  )  .  By
       default, the command line is disabled.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>EnableSSHKeysign</b>
       Setting this option to <b>yes</b> in the global client configuration file <a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_config">/etc/ssh/ssh_config</a> enables the use of
       the  helper  program  ssh-keysign8  during  <b>HostbasedAuthentication</b>  The  argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the
       default).  This option should be placed in  the  non-hostspecific  section.  See  ssh-keysign8  for  more
       information.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>EscapeChar</b>
       Sets the escape character (default: '~' ) . The escape character can also be set on the command line. The
       argument  should be a single character, '^' followed by a letter, or <b>none</b> to disable the escape character
       entirely (making the connection transparent for binary data).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ExitOnForwardFailure</b>
       Specifies whether <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) should terminate the connection if it  cannot  set  up  all  requested  dynamic,
       tunnel,  local,  and  remote  port  forwardings,  (e.g.  if  either end is unable to bind and listen on a
       specified port). Note that <b>ExitOnForwardFailure</b> does not apply to connections made over port  forwardings
       and will not, for example, cause <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) to exit if TCP connections to the ultimate forwarding destination
       fail. The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>FingerprintHash</b>
       Specifies  the  hash  algorithm  used when displaying key fingerprints. Valid options are: <b>md5</b> and <b>sha256</b>
       (the default).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'md5',</u> <u>'sha256'.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           sha256

   <b>ForkAfterAuthentication</b>
       Requests <b>ssh</b> to go to background just before command execution. This is useful if <b>ssh</b> is going to ask for
       passwords or passphrases,  but  the  user  wants  it  in  the  background.  This  implies  the  <b>StdinNull</b>
       configuration  option  being set to ''yes'' The recommended way to start X11 programs at a remote site is
       with something like <b>ssh</b> <b>-f</b> <b>host</b> <b>xterm</b> which is the same as <b>ssh</b> <b>host</b> <b>xterm</b> if the  <b>ForkAfterAuthentication</b>
       configuration option is set to ''yes''

       If  the  <b>ExitOnForwardFailure</b>  configuration  option  is  set  to  ''yes'' then a client started with the
       <b>ForkAfterAuthentication</b> configuration option being set to ''yes'' will wait for all remote port  forwards
       to be successfully established before placing itself in the background. The argument to this keyword must
       be <b>yes</b> (same as the -<b>f</b> option) or <b>no</b> (the default).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>ForwardAgent</b>
       Specifies  whether  the  connection  to the authentication agent (if any) will be forwarded to the remote
       machine. The argument may be <b>yes</b> <b>no</b> (the default), an explicit path to an agent socket or the name of  an
       environment variable (beginning with '$' in which to find the path.

       Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the
       remote  host  (for  the  agent's  Unix-domain  socket)  can  access the local agent through the forwarded
       connection. An attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent, however they can perform operations on
       the keys that enable them to authenticate using the identities loaded into  the  agent.   <u>Optional.</u>  <u>Type</u>
       <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>ForwardX11</b>
       Specifies  whether  X11  connections will be automatically redirected over the secure channel and <b>DISPLAY</b>
       set. The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).

       X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions  on  the
       remote  host  (for  the  user's  X11 authorization database) can access the local X11 display through the
       forwarded connection. An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring  if
       the <b>ForwardX11Trusted</b> option is also enabled.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>ForwardX11Timeout</b>
       Specify  a timeout for untrusted X11 forwarding using the format described in the <u>TIME</u> <u>FORMATS</u> section of
       sshd_config5.  X11  connections  received  by  <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1)  after  this  time   will   be   refused.   Setting
       <b>ForwardX11Timeout</b>  to  zero  will  disable  the  timeout  and  permit  X11 forwarding for the life of the
       connection. The default is to  disable  untrusted  X11  forwarding  after  twenty  minutes  has  elapsed.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>integer.</u>

   <b>ForwardX11Trusted</b>
       If  this  option is set to <b>yes</b> (the Debian-specific default), remote X11 clients will have full access to
       the original X11 display.

       If this option is set to <b>no</b> (the upstream default), remote X11 clients will be considered  untrusted  and
       prevented  from  stealing  or  tampering  with  data  belonging  to trusted X11 clients. Furthermore, the
       <b><a href="../man1/xauth.1.html">xauth</a></b>(1) token used for the session will be set to expire  after  20  minutes.  Remote  clients  will  be
       refused access after this time.

       See  the  X11  SECURITY extension specification for full details on the restrictions imposed on untrusted
       clients.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>GatewayPorts</b>
       Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to local forwarded ports.  By default, <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) binds
       local port forwardings to the loopback address.  This prevents other  remote  hosts  from  connecting  to
       forwarded  ports.  <b>GatewayPorts</b> can be used to specify that ssh should bind local port forwardings to the
       wildcard address, thus allowing remote hosts to connect to forwarded ports. The argument must be  <b>yes</b>  or
       <b>no</b> (the default).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>GlobalKnownHostsFile</b>
       Specifies one or more files to use for the global host key database, separated by whitespace. The default
       is /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts2.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       default value :
           /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts2

   <b>GSSAPIAuthentication</b>
       Specifies  whether  user  authentication  based  on  GSSAPI is allowed. The default is <b>no</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>GSSAPIClientIdentity</b>
       If set, specifies the GSSAPI client identity that ssh should use  when  connecting  to  the  server.  The
       default is unset, which means that the default identity will be used.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>GSSAPIDelegateCredentials</b>
       Forward (delegate) credentials to the server. The default is <b>no</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>GSSAPIKeyExchange</b>
       Specifies  whether  key  exchange  based on GSSAPI may be used. When using GSSAPI key exchange the server
       need not have a host key. The default is ''no''  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>GSSAPIRenewalForcesRekey</b>
       If set to ''yes'' then renewal of the client's GSSAPI credentials will force  the  rekeying  of  the  ssh
       connection.  With  a  compatible  server,  this will delegate the renewed credentials to a session on the
       server.

       Checks are made to ensure that credentials are only propagated when the new  credentials  match  the  old
       ones on the originating client and where the receiving server still has the old set in its cache.

       The default is ''no''

       For  this  to  work  <b>GSSAPIKeyExchange</b>  needs  to  be  enabled in the server and also used by the client.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>GSSAPIServerIdentity</b>
       If set, specifies the GSSAPI server identity that ssh should expect when connecting to  the  server.  The
       default is unset, which means that the expected GSSAPI server identity will be determined from the target
       hostname.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>GSSAPITrustDns</b>
       Set  to  ''yes''  to indicate that the DNS is trusted to securely canonicalize the name of the host being
       connected to. If ''no'' the hostname entered on the command line will be passed untouched to  the  GSSAPI
       library. The default is ''no''  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>GSSAPIKexAlgorithms</b>
       The  list  of  key  exchange  algorithms  that  are offered for GSSAPI key exchange.  Possible values are
       gss-gex-sha1-,    gss-group1-sha1-,    gss-group14-sha1-,    gss-group14-sha256-,    gss-group16-sha512-,

       gss-nistp256-sha256-, gss-curve25519-sha256-
       The  default is ''gss-group14-sha256-, gss-group16-sha512-, gss-nistp256-sha256-, gss-curve25519-sha256-,
       gss-gex-sha1-, gss-group14-sha1-'' This option only applies to connections using GSSAPI.  <u>Optional.</u>  <u>Type</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>HashKnownHosts</b>
       Indicates  that  <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1)  should  hash  host names and addresses when they are added to <a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a>
       These hashed names may be used  normally  by  <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1)  and  <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8),  but  they  do  not  visually  reveal
       identifying  information if the file's contents are disclosed. The default is <b>no</b> Note that existing names
       and addresses in known hosts files will not be converted automatically, but may be manually hashed  using
       ssh-keygen1.  Use  of  this option may break facilities such as tab-completion that rely on being able to
       read unhashed host names from <a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts.">~/.ssh/known_hosts.</a>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms</b>
       Specifies the signature algorithms that will be used for hostbased authentication  as  a  comma-separated
       list  of  patterns.  Alternately  if  the  specified list begins with a '+' character, then the specified
       signature algorithms will be appended to the default set instead of replacing them. If the specified list
       begins with a '-' character, then the  specified  signature  algorithms  (including  wildcards)  will  be
       removed  from  the  default  set  instead  of  replacing  them.  If  the specified list begins with a '^'
       character, then the specified signature algorithms will be placed at the head of the  default  set.   The

   <b>HostKeyAlgorithms</b>
       Specifies the host key signature algorithms that  the  client  wants  to  use  in  order  of  preference.
       Alternately  if  the  specified list begins with a '+' character, then the specified signature algorithms
       will be appended to the default set instead of replacing them. If the specified list begins  with  a  '-'
       character, then the specified signature algorithms (including wildcards) will be removed from the default
       set  instead  of  replacing  them.  If the specified list begins with a '^' character, then the specified

       If hostkeys are known for the destination host then this default is modified to prefer their algorithms.

       The  list  of  available  signature  algorithms  may also be obtained using Qq ssh -Q HostKeyAlgorithms .
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>HostKeyAlias</b>
       Specifies an alias that should be used instead of the real host name when looking up or saving  the  host
       key  in  the  host  key  database  files and when validating host certificates. This option is useful for
       tunneling SSH connections or for multiple servers running on a single host.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Hostname</b>
       Specifies the real host name to log into. This can be used to  specify  nicknames  or  abbreviations  for
       hosts.  Arguments to <b>Hostname</b> accept the tokens described in the <u>TOKENS</u> section. Numeric IP addresses are
       also permitted (both on the command line and in <b>Hostname</b> specifications). The default is the  name  given
       on the command line.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>IdentitiesOnly</b>
       Specifies  that  <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1)  should  only  use  the  configured authentication identity and certificate files
       (either the default files, or those explicitly configured in the <b>ssh_config</b> files or passed on the <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1)
       command-line), even if ssh-agent1 or a <b>PKCS11Provider</b> or <b>SecurityKeyProvider</b> offers more identities.  The
       argument  to  this keyword must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).  This option is intended for situations where
       ssh-agent offers many different identities.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>IdentityAgent</b>
       Specifies the UNIX socket used to communicate with the authentication agent.

       This option overrides the <b>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</b> environment variable and can be used to select a specific  agent.
       Setting  the  socket  name  to  <b>none</b>  disables  the  use  of  an  authentication  agent. If the string Qq
       SSH_AUTH_SOCK is specified, the location of the socket will be read from  the  <b>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</b>  environment
       variable.  Otherwise  if  the  specified value begins with a '$' character, then it will be treated as an
       environment variable containing the location of the socket.

       Arguments to <b>IdentityAgent</b> may use the tilde syntax to refer to  a  user's  home  directory,  the  tokens
       described  in  the  <u>TOKENS</u>  section  and  environment variables as described in the <u>ENVIRONMENT</u> <u>VARIABLES</u>
       section.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>IdentityFile</b>
       Specifies a file from which the user's ECDSA, authenticator-hosted ECDSA,  Ed25519,  authenticator-hosted
       Ed25519  or  RSA  authentication  identity  is  read.   You can also specify a public key file to use the
       corresponding private key that is loaded in ssh-agent1 when the private key file is not present  locally.
       The    default    is    <a href="file:~/.ssh/id_rsa">~/.ssh/id_rsa</a>    <a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ecdsa">~/.ssh/id_ecdsa</a>    <a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk">~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk</a>    <a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ed25519">~/.ssh/id_ed25519</a>   and
       <a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk">~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk</a> Additionally, any identities represented by the authentication agent  will  be  used
       for  authentication  unless  <b>IdentitiesOnly</b>  is set. If no certificates have been explicitly specified by
       <b>CertificateFile</b> <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) will try to load certificate information from the filename obtained  by  appending
       -cert.pub to the path of a specified <b>IdentityFile</b>

       Arguments  to  <b>IdentityFile</b>  may  use  the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory or the tokens
       described in the <u>TOKENS</u> section. Alternately an argument of <b>none</b> may be  used  to  indicate  no  identity
       files should be loaded.

       It  is  possible  to  have multiple identity files specified in configuration files; all these identities
       will be tried in sequence. Multiple <b>IdentityFile</b> directives will add to  the  list  of  identities  tried
       (this behaviour differs from that of other configuration directives).

       <b>IdentityFile</b>  may  be  used in conjunction with <b>IdentitiesOnly</b> to select which identities in an agent are
       offered during authentication. <b>IdentityFile</b> may also be used in conjunction with <b>CertificateFile</b> in order
       to provide any certificate also needed for authentication with the  identity.   <u>Optional.</u>  <u>Type</u>  <u>list</u>  <u>of</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>IgnoreUnknown</b>
       Specifies  a  pattern-list  of  unknown  options  to  be ignored if they are encountered in configuration
       parsing. This may be used to suppress errors if <b>ssh_config</b> contains  options  that  are  unrecognised  by
       <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1).  It is recommended that <b>IgnoreUnknown</b> be listed early in the configuration file as it will not be
       applied to unknown options that appear before it.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Include</b>
       Include the specified configuration file(s). Multiple pathnames may be specified and  each  pathname  may
       contain  <b><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></b>(7) wildcards, tokens as described in the <u>TOKENS</u> section, environment variables as described
       in the <u>ENVIRONMENT</u> <u>VARIABLES</u> section and, for user configurations, shell-like '~' references to user home
       directories. Wildcards will be expanded and processed in lexical order. Files without absolute paths  are
       assumed  to be in <a href="file:~/.ssh">~/.ssh</a> if included in a user configuration file or <a href="file:/etc/ssh">/etc/ssh</a> if included from the system
       configuration file. <b>Include</b> directive may appear inside a <b>Match</b> or  <b>Host</b>  block  to  perform  conditional
       inclusion.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>IPQoS</b>
       Specifies the IPv4 type-of-service or DSCP class for connections. Accepted values are <b>af11</b> <b>af12</b> <b>af13</b> <b>af21</b>

       <b>reliability</b> a numeric value, or <b>none</b> to use the operating system default. This option may take one or two
       arguments, separated by whitespace. If one argument  is  specified,  it  is  used  as  the  packet  class
       unconditionally.  If  two  values  are  specified,  the  first  is automatically selected for interactive
       sessions and the second for non-interactive sessions. The default is <b>lowdelay</b>  for  interactive  sessions
       and <b>throughput</b> for non-interactive sessions.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           af21 cs1

   <b>KbdInteractiveAuthentication</b>
       Specifies  whether  to  use keyboard-interactive authentication. The argument to this keyword must be <b>yes</b>
       (the default) or <b>no</b> <b>ChallengeResponseAuthentication</b> is a  deprecated  alias  for  this.   <u>Optional.</u>  <u>Type</u>
       <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   <b>KbdInteractiveDevices</b>
       Specifies  the list of methods to use in keyboard-interactive authentication.  Multiple method names must
       be comma-separated. The default is to use the server specified list. The methods available vary depending
       on what the server supports. For an OpenSSH server, it may be zero or more of: <b>bsdauth</b> and <b>pam</b>  <u>Optional.</u>
       <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>KexAlgorithms</b>
       Specifies the permitted KEX (Key Exchange) algorithms that will be used and their preference  order.  The
       selected  algorithm  will  be  the  first  algorithm in this list that the server also supports. Multiple
       algorithms must be comma-separated.

       If the specified list begins with a '+' character, then the specified algorithms will be appended to  the
       default  set  instead  of  replacing  them.  If  the specified list begins with a '-' character, then the
       specified algorithms (including wildcards) will be removed from the  default  set  instead  of  replacing
       them.  If the specified list begins with a '^' character, then the specified algorithms will be placed at
       the head of the default set.

   <b>LocalCommand</b>
       Specifies  a  command  to  execute  on the local machine after successfully connecting to the server. The
       command string extends to the end of the line, and is  executed  with  the  user's  shell.  Arguments  to
       <b>LocalCommand</b> accept the tokens described in the <u>TOKENS</u> section.

       The  command  is run synchronously and does not have access to the session of the <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) that spawned it.
       It should not be used for interactive commands.

       This directive is ignored unless <b>PermitLocalCommand</b> has been enabled.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>LocalForward</b>
       Specifies that a TCP port on the local machine be forwarded over the secure channel to the specified host
       and port from the remote machine. The first argument specifies the listener and may  be  [<u>bind_address</u>  <u>:</u>
       <u>port</u>  ] or a Unix domain socket path. The second argument is the destination and may be <u>host</u> <u>:</u>   <u>hostport</u>
       or a Unix domain socket path if the remote host supports it.

       IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing addresses in square brackets.  Multiple forwardings  may  be
       specified,  and  additional  forwardings can be given on the command line. Only the superuser can forward
       privileged ports. By default, the local port is  bound  in  accordance  with  the  <b>GatewayPorts</b>  setting.
       However,  an  explicit  <u>bind_address</u>  may  be  used  to  bind  the  connection to a specific address. The
       <u>bind_address</u> of <b>localhost</b> indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only, while  an  empty
       address  or '*' indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces. Unix domain socket paths
       may use the tokens described in the  <u>TOKENS</u>  section  and  environment  variables  as  described  in  the
       <u>ENVIRONMENT</u> <u>VARIABLES</u> section.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>node</u> <u>of</u> <u>class</u> <u>Ssh::PortForward</u> <u>.</u>

   <b>LogLevel</b>
       Gives  the  verbosity  level  that  is  used when logging messages from <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1).  The possible values are:
       QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3. The default  is  INFO.  DEBUG  and
       DEBUG1  are  equivalent.  DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher levels of verbose output.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'DEBUG',</u> <u>'DEBUG1',</u> <u>'DEBUG2',</u> <u>'DEBUG3',</u> <u>'ERROR',</u> <u>'FATAL',</u> <u>'INFO',</u> <u>'QUIET',</u> <u>'VERBOSE'.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           INFO

   <b>LogVerbose</b>
       Specify one or more overrides to LogLevel. An override consists of one or more pattern lists that matches
       the source file, function and line number to force detailed logging for. For example, an override pattern
       of: kex.c:*:1000,*:<b>kex_exchange_identification()</b>:*, packet.c:*

       would enable detailed logging for line 1000 of kex.c everything  in  the  Fn  kex_exchange_identification
       function,  and  all code in the packet.c file. This option is intended for debugging and no overrides are
       enabled by default.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>MACs</b>
       Specifies the MAC (message authentication code) algorithms

       in order of preference. The MAC algorithm is used for data integrity protection. Multiple algorithms must
       be comma-separated. If the specified list begins with a '+' character, then the specified algorithms will
       be appended to the default set instead of replacing them.  If  the  specified  list  begins  with  a  '-'
       character,  then  the  specified  algorithms  (including  wildcards) will be removed from the default set
       instead of replacing them. If the specified  list  begins  with  a  '^'  character,  then  the  specified
       algorithms will be placed at the head of the default set.

       The  algorithms  that  contain  Qq  -etm calculate the MAC after encryption (encrypt-then-mac). These are
       considered safer and their use recommended.

       The  default  is:   <a href="mailto:umac-64-etm@openssh.com">umac-64-etm@openssh.com</a>,   <a href="mailto:umac-128-etm@openssh.com">umac-128-etm@openssh.com</a>,   <a href="mailto:hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com">hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com</a>,

       hmac-sha2-256, hmac-sha2-512, hmac-sha1

       The list of available MAC algorithms may also be obtained using Qq ssh -Q mac .  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost</b>
       Disable host authentication for localhost (loopback addresses). The argument to this keyword must be  <b>yes</b>
       or <b>no</b> (the default).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>NumberOfPasswordPrompts</b>
       Specifies  the  number  of  password  prompts  before  giving up. The argument to this keyword must be an
       integer. The default is 3.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>integer.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           3

   <b>ObscureKeystrokeTiming</b>
       Specifies whether <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) should try to obscure inter-keystroke timings from passive observers of  network
       traffic.  If  enabled, then for interactive sessions, <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) will send keystrokes at fixed intervals of a
       few tens of milliseconds and will send fake keystroke packets for some  time  after  typing  ceases.  The
       argument  to this keyword must be <b>yes</b> <b>no</b> or an interval specifier of the form <b>interval:milliseconds</b> (e.g.
       <b>interval:80</b> for 80 milliseconds). The default is to obscure keystrokes using a 20ms packet interval. Note
       that smaller intervals will result in higher fake keystroke packet rates.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           interval:20

   <b>PasswordAuthentication</b>
       Specifies whether to use password authentication. The argument to this keyword must be <b>yes</b> (the  default)
       or <b>no</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   <b>PermitLocalCommand</b>
       Allow  local  command  execution  via  the <b>LocalCommand</b> option or using the <b>!</b>  <u>command</u> escape sequence in
       <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1). The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>PermitRemoteOpen</b>
       Specifies the destinations to which remote TCP port forwarding is permitted when <b>RemoteForward</b> is used as
       a SOCKS proxy. The forwarding specification must be one of the following forms:

       <b>PermitRemoteOpen</b> <u>host</u> <u>:</u> <u>port</u> <b>PermitRemoteOpen</b> <u>IPv4_addr</u> <u>:</u> <u>port</u> <b>PermitRemoteOpen</b> <u>[</u> <u>IPv6_addr</u> <u>]</u> <u>:</u> <u>port</u>

       Multiple forwards may be specified by separating them with whitespace. An argument of <b>any</b> can be used  to
       remove  all  restrictions and permit any forwarding requests. An argument of <b>none</b> can be used to prohibit
       all forwarding requests. The wildcard '*' can be used for host or  port  to  allow  all  hosts  or  ports
       respectively.  Otherwise,  no  pattern  matching  or  address  lookups  are  performed on supplied names.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>PKCS11Provider</b>
       Specifies which PKCS#11 provider to use or <b>none</b>  to  indicate  that  no  provider  should  be  used  (the
       default).  The  argument  to  this  keyword  is a path to the PKCS#11 shared library <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) should use to
       communicate with a PKCS#11 token providing keys for user authentication.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Port</b>
       Specifies the port number to connect on the remote host. The default is 22.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>PreferredAuthentications</b>
       Specifies the order in which the client should try authentication methods. This allows a client to prefer
       one method (e.g. <b>keyboard-interactive</b> over another method (e.g. <b>password</b> <b>)</b> The default  is:  gssapi-with-
       mic, hostbased, publickey, keyboard-interactive, password.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ProxyCommand</b>
       Specifies the command to use to connect to the server. The command string extends to the end of the line,
       and is executed using the user's shell 'exec' directive to avoid a lingering shell process.

       Arguments to <b>ProxyCommand</b> accept the tokens described in the <u>TOKENS</u> section. The command can be basically
       anything,  and should read from its standard input and write to its standard output. It should eventually
       connect an <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) server running on some machine, or execute <b>sshd</b> <b>-i</b>  somewhere.   Host  key  management
       will  be  done using the <b>Hostname</b> of the host being connected (defaulting to the name typed by the user).
       Setting the command to <b>none</b> disables this option entirely. Note that <b>CheckHostIP</b>  is  not  available  for
       connects with a proxy command.

       This  directive  is  useful  in conjunction with <b><a href="../man1/nc.1.html">nc</a></b>(1) and its proxy support.  For example, the following
       directive would connect  via  an  HTTP  proxy  at  192.0.2.0:  ProxyCommand  <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?nc">/usr/bin/nc</a>  -X  connect  -x
       192.0.2.0:8080 %h %p.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ProxyJump</b>
       Specifies  one  or more jump proxies as either [<u>user</u>  <b>@</b> ] <u>host</u> [: <u>port</u> ] or an ssh URI . Multiple proxies
       may be separated by comma characters and will be visited sequentially. Setting  this  option  will  cause
       <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1)  to connect to the target host by first making a <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) connection to the specified <b>ProxyJump</b> host
       and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate target  from  there.  Setting  the  host  to  <b>none</b>
       disables this option entirely.

       Note  that  this  option  will  compete  with the <b>ProxyCommand</b> option - whichever is specified first will
       prevent later instances of the other from taking effect.

       Note also that the configuration for the destination host (either supplied via the  command-line  or  the
       configuration  file)  is  not  generally  applied to jump hosts. <a href="file:~/.ssh/config">~/.ssh/config</a> should be used if specific
       configuration is required for jump hosts.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ProxyUseFdpass</b>
       Specifies that <b>ProxyCommand</b> will pass a connected file descriptor back to <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) instead of continuing to
       execute and pass data. The default is <b>no</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms</b>
       Specifies the signature algorithms that will be used for public key authentication as  a  comma-separated
       list of patterns. If the specified list begins with a '+' character, then the algorithms after it will be
       appended  to the default instead of replacing it. If the specified list begins with a '-' character, then
       the specified algorithms (including wildcards) will be removed from the default set instead of  replacing
       them.  If the specified list begins with a '^' character, then the specified algorithms will be placed at
       the head  of  the  default  set.  The  default  for  this  option  is:  <a href="mailto:ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com">ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com</a>,

       The list of available signature algorithms may also be obtained using Qq ssh -Q  PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms
       .  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       Note: PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms is migrated with '$old' and with:

       •   $old =&gt; "- PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes"

   <b>PubkeyAuthentication</b>
       Specifies  whether  to  try  public  key  authentication.  The  argument to this keyword must be <b>yes</b> (the
       default), <b>no</b> <b>unbound</b> or  <b>host-bound</b>  The  final  two  options  enable  public  key  authentication  while
       respectively  disabling or enabling the OpenSSH host-bound authentication protocol extension required for
       restricted ssh-agent1 forwarding.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'host-bound',</u> <u>'no',</u> <u>'unbound',</u> <u>'yes'.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   <b>RekeyLimit</b>
       Specifies the maximum amount of data that may be transmitted  or  received  before  the  session  key  is
       renegotiated,  optionally  followed  by  a maximum amount of time that may pass before the session key is
       renegotiated. The first argument is specified in bytes and may have  a  suffix  of  'K'  'M'  or  'G'  to
       indicate Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively. The default is between '1G' and '4G' depending
       on  the cipher. The optional second value is specified in seconds and may use any of the units documented
       in the TIME FORMATS section of sshd_config5. The default value for <b>RekeyLimit</b> is <b>default</b> <b>none</b> which means
       that rekeying is performed after the cipher's default amount of data has been sent  or  received  and  no
       time based rekeying is done.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RemoteCommand</b>
       Specifies  a  command  to  execute on the remote machine after successfully connecting to the server. The
       command string extends to the end of the line, and is  executed  with  the  user's  shell.  Arguments  to
       <b>RemoteCommand</b> accept the tokens described in the <u>TOKENS</u> section.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RemoteForward</b>
       Specifies that a TCP port on the remote machine be forwarded over the secure channel. The remote port may
       either  be forwarded to a specified host and port from the local machine, or may act as a SOCKS 4/5 proxy
       that allows a remote client to connect to arbitrary  destinations  from  the  local  machine.  The  first
       argument is the listening specification and may be [<u>bind_address</u> <u>:</u> <u>port</u> ] or, if the remote host supports
       it,  a  Unix domain socket path. If forwarding to a specific destination then the second argument must be
       <u>host</u> <u>:</u> <u>hostport</u> or a Unix domain socket path, otherwise if no destination argument is specified then  the
       remote forwarding will be established as a SOCKS proxy.  When acting as a SOCKS proxy, the destination of
       the connection can be restricted by <b>PermitRemoteOpen</b>

       IPv6  addresses  can be specified by enclosing addresses in square brackets.  Multiple forwardings may be
       specified, and additional forwardings can be given on the command line. Privileged ports can be forwarded
       only when logging in as root on the remote machine. Unix domain socket paths may use the tokens described
       in the <u>TOKENS</u> section and environment variables as described in the <u>ENVIRONMENT</u> <u>VARIABLES</u> section.

       If the <u>port</u> argument is 0, the listen port will be dynamically allocated on the server  and  reported  to
       the client at run time.

       If  the  <u>bind_address</u>  is  not  specified,  the  default  is  to  only bind to loopback addresses. If the
       <u>bind_address</u> is '*' or an empty string, then the forwarding is requested to  listen  on  all  interfaces.
       Specifying  a  remote  <u>bind_address</u> will only succeed if the server's <b>GatewayPorts</b> option is enabled (see
       sshd_config5).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>node</u> <u>of</u> <u>class</u> <u>Ssh::PortForward</u> <u>.</u>

   <b>RequestTTY</b>
       Specifies whether to request a pseudo-tty for the session. The argument may be one of: <b>no</b> (never  request
       a  TTY),  <b>yes</b>  (always  request a TTY when standard input is a TTY), <b>force</b> (always request a TTY) or <b>auto</b>
       (request a TTY when opening a login session). This option  mirrors  the  -<b>t</b>  and  -<b>T</b>  flags  for  <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1).
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'auto',</u> <u>'force',</u> <u>'no',</u> <u>'yes'.</u>

   <b>RequiredRSASize</b>
       Specifies  the  minimum  RSA key size (in bits) that <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) will accept. User authentication keys smaller
       than this limit will be ignored. Servers that present host keys smaller than this limit  will  cause  the
       connection  to  be terminated. The default is <b>1024</b> bits. Note that this limit may only be raised from the
       default.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>integer.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           1024

   <b>RevokedHostKeys</b>
       Specifies revoked host public keys. Keys listed in this file will be  refused  for  host  authentication.
       Note  that  if  this file does not exist or is not readable, then host authentication will be refused for
       all hosts. Keys may be specified as a text file, listing one public key per line, or as  an  OpenSSH  Key
       Revocation  List  (KRL) as generated by ssh-keygen1. For more information on KRLs, see the KEY REVOCATION
       LISTS section in ssh-keygen1. Arguments to <b>RevokedHostKeys</b> may use the tilde syntax to refer to a  user's
       home  directory, the tokens described in the <u>TOKENS</u> section and environment variables as described in the
       <u>ENVIRONMENT</u> <u>VARIABLES</u> section.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SecurityKeyProvider</b>
       Specifies a path to a library that  will  be  used  when  loading  any  FIDO  authenticator-hosted  keys,
       overriding the default of using the built-in USB HID support.

       If  the  specified  value begins with a '$' character, then it will be treated as an environment variable
       containing the path to the library.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SendEnv</b>
       Specifies what variables from the local <b><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></b>(7) should be sent to the server.  The  server  must  also
       support  it,  and the server must be configured to accept these environment variables. Note that the <b>TERM</b>
       environment variable is always sent whenever a pseudo-terminal is requested as  it  is  required  by  the
       protocol.  Refer to <b>AcceptEnv</b> in sshd_config5 for how to configure the server. Variables are specified by
       name, which may contain  wildcard  characters.   Multiple  environment  variables  may  be  separated  by
       whitespace or spread across multiple <b>SendEnv</b> directives.

       See <u>PATTERNS</u> for more information on patterns.

       It is possible to clear previously set <b>SendEnv</b> variable names by prefixing patterns with - The default is
       not to send any environment variables.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ServerAliveCountMax</b>
       Sets  the  number  of  server  alive  messages (see below) which may be sent without <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) receiving any
       messages back from the server. If this threshold is reached while server alive messages are  being  sent,
       ssh  will  disconnect  from  the server, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of
       server alive messages is very different from <b>TCPKeepAlive</b> (below). The server  alive  messages  are  sent
       through  the  encrypted  channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option enabled by
       <b>TCPKeepAlive</b> is spoofable. The server alive mechanism is valuable when the client  or  server  depend  on
       knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.

       The   default  value  is  3.  If,  for  example,  <b>ServerAliveInterval</b>  (see  below)  is  set  to  15  and
       <b>ServerAliveCountMax</b> is left at the default, if the server becomes unresponsive, ssh will disconnect after
       approximately 45 seconds.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>integer.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           3

   <b>ServerAliveInterval</b>
       Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the server, <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1)  will
       send  a  message  through  the encrypted channel to request a response from the server. The default is 0,
       indicating that these messages will not be sent to the server, or 300 if  the  <b>BatchMode</b>  option  is  set
       (Debian-specific).   <b>ProtocolKeepAlives</b>  is  a  Debian-specific  compatibility  alias  for  this  option.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>integer.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           0

   <b>SessionType</b>
       May be used to either request invocation of a subsystem on the remote system, or to prevent the execution
       of a remote command at all. The latter is useful for just forwarding ports. The argument to this  keyword
       must  be  <b>none</b>  (same  as  the -<b>N</b> option), <b>subsystem</b> (same as the -<b>s</b> option) or <b>default</b> (shell or command
       execution).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'default',</u> <u>'none',</u> <u>'subsystem'.</u>

   <b>SetEnv</b>
       Directly specify one or more environment variables and their contents to be sent to the server. Similarly
       to <b>SendEnv</b> with the exception of the <b>TERM</b> variable, the server must be prepared to accept the environment
       variable.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>StdinNull</b>
       Redirects stdin from /dev/null (actually, prevents reading from stdin). Either this or the equivalent  -<b>n</b>
       option  must be used when <b>ssh</b> is run in the background. The argument to this keyword must be <b>yes</b> (same as
       the -<b>n</b> option) or <b>no</b> (the default).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>StreamLocalBindMask</b>
       Sets the octal file creation mode mask (umask) used when creating a Unix-domain socket file for local  or
       remote port forwarding. This option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.

       The  default value is 0177, which creates a Unix-domain socket file that is readable and writable only by
       the owner. Note that not all  operating  systems  honor  the  file  mode  on  Unix-domain  socket  files.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>StreamLocalBindUnlink</b>
       Specifies  whether  to  remove  an  existing  Unix-domain socket file for local or remote port forwarding
       before creating a new one. If the socket file already exists and <b>StreamLocalBindUnlink</b>  is  not  enabled,
       <b>ssh</b>  will be unable to forward the port to the Unix-domain socket file. This option is only used for port
       forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.

       The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> (the default).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>StrictHostKeyChecking</b>
       If this flag is set to <b>yes</b> <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) will never automatically add host keys to the <a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a>  file,
       and refuses to connect to hosts whose host key has changed. This provides maximum protection against man-
       in-the-middle  (MITM) attacks, though it can be annoying when the /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts file is poorly
       maintained or when connections to new hosts are frequently made. This option forces the user to  manually
       add all new hosts.

       If this flag is set to <b>accept-new</b> then ssh will automatically add new host keys to the user's known_hosts
       file,  but  will not permit connections to hosts with changed host keys. If this flag is set to <b>no</b> or <b>off</b>
       ssh will automatically add new host keys to the user known hosts files and  allow  connections  to  hosts
       with changed hostkeys to proceed, subject to some restrictions. If this flag is set to <b>ask</b> (the default),
       new  host  keys will be added to the user known host files only after the user has confirmed that is what
       they really want to do, and ssh will refuse to connect to hosts whose host key has changed. The host keys
       of known hosts will be verified  automatically  in  all  cases.   <u>Optional.</u>  <u>Type</u>  <u>enum.</u>  <u>choice:</u>  <u>'yes',</u>
       <u>'accept-new',</u> <u>'no',</u> <u>'off',</u> <u>'ask'.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           ask

   <b>SyslogFacility</b>
       Gives  the facility code that is used when logging messages from <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1). The possible values are: DAEMON,
       USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2,  LOCAL3,  LOCAL4,  LOCAL5,  LOCAL6,  LOCAL7.  The  default  is  USER.
       <u>Optional.</u>  <u>Type</u>  <u>enum.</u>  <u>choice:</u>  <u>'AUTH',</u>  <u>'DAEMON',</u>  <u>'LOCAL0',</u>  <u>'LOCAL1',</u>  <u>'LOCAL2',</u>  <u>'LOCAL3',</u> <u>'LOCAL4',</u>
       <u>'LOCAL5',</u> <u>'LOCAL6',</u> <u>'LOCAL7',</u> <u>'USER'.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           USER

   <b>TCPKeepAlive</b>
       Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the other  side.  If  they  are  sent,
       death  of  the connection or crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed. This option only uses
       TCP keepalives (as opposed to using ssh level keepalives), so takes  a  long  time  to  notice  when  the
       connection  dies. As such, you probably want the <b>ServerAliveInterval</b> option as well.  However, this means
       that connections will die if the route is down temporarily, and some people find it annoying.

       The default is <b>yes</b> (to send TCP keepalive messages), and the client will notice if the network goes  down
       or the remote host dies. This is important in scripts, and many users want it too.

       To  disable  TCP  keepalive  messages,  the  value  should  be set to <b>no</b> See also <b>ServerAliveInterval</b> for
       protocol-level keepalives.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   <b>Tag</b>
       Specify a configuration tag name that may be later used by  a  <b>Match</b>  directive  to  select  a  block  of
       configuration.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Tunnel</b>
       Request  <b><a href="../man4/tun.4.html">tun</a></b>(4)  device  forwarding between the client and the server. The argument must be <b>yes</b> <b>point-to-</b>
       <b>point</b> (layer 3), <b>ethernet</b> (layer 2), or <b>no</b> (the default). Specifying  <b>yes</b>  requests  the  default  tunnel
       mode, which is <b>point-to-point</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'ethernet',</u> <u>'no',</u> <u>'point-to-point',</u> <u>'yes'.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>TunnelDevice</b>
       Specifies the <b><a href="../man4/tun.4.html">tun</a></b>(4) devices to open on the client (<u>local_tun</u> ) and the server (<u>remote_tun</u> )

       The  argument  must  be  <u>local_tun</u>   [:  <u>remote_tun</u> ] The devices may be specified by numerical ID or the
       keyword <b>any</b> which uses the next available tunnel device. If <u>remote_tun</u> is not specified, it  defaults  to
       <b>any</b> The default is <b>any:any</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           any:any

   <b>UpdateHostKeys</b>
       Specifies  whether  <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1)  should accept notifications of additional hostkeys from the server sent after
       authentication has completed and add them to <b>UserKnownHostsFile</b> The argument must be <b>yes</b> <b>no</b> or  <b>ask</b>  This
       option  allows  learning alternate hostkeys for a server and supports graceful key rotation by allowing a
       server to send replacement public keys before old ones are removed.

       Additional hostkeys are only accepted if the key used to authenticate the host  was  already  trusted  or
       explicitly   accepted  by  the  user,  the  host  was  authenticated  via  <b>UserKnownHostsFile</b>  (i.e.  not
       <b>GlobalKnownHostsFile</b> and the host was authenticated using a plain key and not a certificate.

       <b>UpdateHostKeys</b> is enabled by default if the  user  has  not  overridden  the  default  <b>UserKnownHostsFile</b>
       setting and has not enabled <b>VerifyHostKeyDNS</b> otherwise <b>UpdateHostKeys</b> will be set to <b>no</b>

       If  <b>UpdateHostKeys</b>  is  set to <b>ask</b> then the user is asked to confirm the modifications to the known_hosts
       file. Confirmation is currently incompatible with <b>ControlPersist</b> and will be disabled if it is enabled.

       Presently, only <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) from OpenSSH  6.8  and  greater  support  the  Qq  <a href="mailto:hostkeys@openssh.com">hostkeys@openssh.com</a>  protocol
       extension  used  to  inform the client of all the server's hostkeys.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'ask',</u>
       <u>'no',</u> <u>'yes'.</u>

   <b>User</b>
       Specifies the user to log in as. This can be useful when a different  user  name  is  used  on  different
       machines.  This  saves  the  trouble  of  having  to  remember to give the user name on the command line.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>UserKnownHostsFile</b>
       Specifies one or more files to use for the user host key database, separated by whitespace. Each filename
       may use tilde notation to refer to the user's home directory, the tokens described in the <u>TOKENS</u>  section
       and  environment  variables  as  described  in  the <u>ENVIRONMENT</u> <u>VARIABLES</u> section. A value of <b>none</b> causes
       <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1)  to  ignore  any  user-specific   known   hosts   files.   The   default   is   <a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a>
       <a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts2.">~/.ssh/known_hosts2.</a>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>VerifyHostKeyDNS</b>
       Specifies whether to verify the remote key using DNS and SSHFP resource records. If this option is set to
       <b>yes</b> the client will implicitly trust keys that match a secure fingerprint from DNS. Insecure fingerprints
       will  be handled as if this option was set to <b>ask</b> If this option is set to <b>ask</b> information on fingerprint
       match will be displayed, but the user will  still  need  to  confirm  new  host  keys  according  to  the
       <b>StrictHostKeyChecking</b> option. The default is <b>no</b>

       See also <u>VERIFYING</u> <u>HOST</u> <u>KEYS</u> in <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'ask',</u> <u>'no',</u> <u>'yes'.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>VisualHostKey</b>
       If  this  flag is set to <b>yes</b> an ASCII art representation of the remote host key fingerprint is printed in
       addition to the fingerprint string at login and for unknown host keys. If this flag is  set  to  <b>no</b>  (the
       default), no fingerprint strings are printed at login and only the fingerprint string will be printed for
       unknown host keys.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>XAuthLocation</b>
       Specifies  the  full  pathname  of  the  <b><a href="../man1/xauth.1.html">xauth</a></b>(1) program. The default is /usr/bin/xauth.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>
