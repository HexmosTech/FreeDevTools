</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Config::Model::models::Sshd - Configuration class Sshd

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration classes used by Config::Model

       This configuration class was generated from sshd_system documentation.  by parse-man.pl
       &lt;https://github.com/dod38fr/config-model-openssh/contrib/parse-man.pl&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Elements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>AcceptEnv</b>
       Specifies what environment variables sent by the client will be copied into the session's <b><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></b>(7). See
       <b>SendEnv</b> and <b>SetEnv</b> in ssh_config5 for how to configure the client. The <b>TERM</b> environment variable is
       always accepted whenever the client requests a pseudo-terminal as it is required by the protocol.
       Variables are specified by name, which may contain the wildcard characters '*' and '?' Multiple
       environment variables may be separated by whitespace or spread across multiple <b>AcceptEnv</b> directives. Be
       warned that some environment variables could be used to bypass restricted user environments. For this
       reason, care should be taken in the use of this directive. The default is not to accept any environment
       variables.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>AllowAgentForwarding</b>
       Specifies whether ssh-agent1 forwarding is permitted. The default is <b>yes</b> Note that disabling agent
       forwarding does not improve security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can always
       install their own forwarders.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   <b>AllowGroups</b>
       This  keyword  can be followed by a list of group name patterns, separated by spaces. If specified, login
       is allowed only for users whose primary group or supplementary group list matches one  of  the  patterns.
       Only  group names are valid; a numerical group ID is not recognized. By default, login is allowed for all
       groups. The allow/deny groups directives are processed in the following order: <b>DenyGroups</b> <b>AllowGroups</b>

       See PATTERNS in ssh_config5 for more information on patterns. This keyword may appear multiple  times  in
       <b>sshd_config</b> with each instance appending to the list.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>AllowStreamLocalForwarding</b>
       Specifies whether StreamLocal (Unix-domain socket) forwarding is permitted. The available options are <b>yes</b>
       (the  default) or <b>all</b> to allow StreamLocal forwarding, <b>no</b> to prevent all StreamLocal forwarding, <b>local</b> to
       allow local (from the perspective of <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1)) forwarding only or <b>remote</b> to allow remote  forwarding  only.
       Note  that  disabling StreamLocal forwarding does not improve security unless users are also denied shell
       access, as they can always install their own forwarders.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u>  <u>choice:</u>  <u>'all',</u>  <u>'local',</u>
       <u>'no',</u> <u>'remote',</u> <u>'yes'.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   <b>AllowTcpForwarding</b>
       Specifies  whether  TCP  forwarding  is  permitted. The available options are <b>yes</b> (the default) or <b>all</b> to
       allow TCP forwarding, <b>no</b> to prevent all TCP forwarding, <b>local</b> to allow local  (from  the  perspective  of
       <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1))  forwarding  only  or  <b>remote</b> to allow remote forwarding only. Note that disabling TCP forwarding
       does not improve security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can always install their own
       forwarders.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'all',</u> <u>'local',</u> <u>'no',</u> <u>'remote',</u> <u>'yes'.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   <b>AllowUsers</b>
       This keyword can be followed by a list of user name patterns, separated by spaces. If specified, login is
       allowed only for user names that match one of the patterns. Only user names are valid; a  numerical  user
       ID  is  not  recognized.   By  default,  login  is  allowed  for all users. If the pattern takes the form
       USER@HOST then USER and HOST  are  separately  checked,  restricting  logins  to  particular  users  from
       particular  hosts.  HOST  criteria  may  additionally  contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen
       format. The allow/deny users directives are processed in the following order: <b>DenyUsers</b> <b>AllowUsers</b>

       See PATTERNS in ssh_config5 for more information on patterns. This keyword may appear multiple  times  in
       <b>sshd_config</b> with each instance appending to the list.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>AuthenticationMethods</b>
       Specifies the authentication methods that must be successfully completed for a user to be granted access.
       This  option  must be followed by one or more lists of comma-separated authentication method names, or by
       the single string <b>any</b> to indicate the default behaviour of accepting any  single  authentication  method.
       If  the  default  is overridden, then successful authentication requires completion of every method in at
       least one of these lists.

       For example, Qq publickey, password publickey, keyboard-interactive would require the  user  to  complete
       public  key  authentication,  followed  by  either  password or keyboard interactive authentication. Only
       methods that are next in one or more lists are offered at each stage, so for this example it would not be
       possible to attempt password or keyboard-interactive authentication before public key.

       For keyboard interactive authentication it is also possible to  restrict  authentication  to  a  specific
       device  by  appending  a  colon  followed by the device identifier <b>bsdauth</b> or <b>pam</b> depending on the server
       configuration.  For  example,  Qq  keyboard-interactive:bsdauth  would  restrict   keyboard   interactive
       authentication to the <b>bsdauth</b> device.

       If  the  publickey  method  is  listed  more  than  once,  <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) verifies that keys that have been used
       successfully are not reused  for  subsequent  authentications.   For  example,  Qq  publickey,  publickey
       requires successful authentication using two different public keys.

       Note that each authentication method listed should also be explicitly enabled in the configuration.

       The  available  authentication methods are: Qq gssapi-with-mic , Qq hostbased , Qq keyboard-interactive ,
       Qq none (used for access to password-less accounts when <b>PermitEmptyPasswords</b> is enabled), Qq password and
       Qq publickey .  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand</b>
       Specifies a program to be used to look up the user's public keys. The program must be owned by root,  not
       writable  by group or others and specified by an absolute path. Arguments to <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand</b> accept
       the tokens described in the <u>TOKENS</u> section. If no arguments are specified then the username of the target
       user is used.

       The program should produce on  standard  output  zero  or  more  lines  of  authorized_keys  output  (see
       <u>AUTHORIZED_KEYS</u> in <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8)).  <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand</b> is tried after the usual <b>AuthorizedKeysFile</b> files and
       will  not  be  executed  if  a  matching key is found there. By default, no <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand</b> is run.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>AuthorizedKeysCommandUser</b>
       Specifies the user under whose account the <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand</b> is run.  It  is  recommended  to  use  a
       dedicated  user  that  has  no  other  role  on  the  host  than  running  authorized  keys  commands. If
       <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand</b> is specified but <b>AuthorizedKeysCommandUser</b> is not,  then  <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8)  will  refuse  to
       start.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>AuthorizedKeysFile</b>
       Specifies  the  file that contains the public keys used for user authentication.  The format is described
       in the AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT section of <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8). Arguments to <b>AuthorizedKeysFile</b> accept the  tokens
       described  in  the <u>TOKENS</u> section. After expansion, <b>AuthorizedKeysFile</b> is taken to be an absolute path or
       one relative to the user's home directory.  Multiple  files  may  be  listed,  separated  by  whitespace.
       Alternately  this  option  may  be set to <b>none</b> to skip checking for user keys in files. The default is Qq
       .ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys2 .  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       Note: AuthorizedKeysFile values are migrated from '- AuthorizedKeysFile2'

   <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</b>
       Specifies a program  to  be  used  to  generate  the  list  of  allowed  certificate  principals  as  per
       <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b> The program must be owned by root, not writable by group or others and specified
       by  an absolute path.  Arguments to <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</b> accept the tokens described in the <u>TOKENS</u>
       section. If no arguments are specified then the username of the target user is used.

       The program should produce on standard output zero or more lines of <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b>  output.  If
       either <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</b> or <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b> is specified, then certificates offered by
       the   client   for   authentication   must   contain   a   principal  that  is  listed.  By  default,  no
       <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</b> is run.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser</b>
       Specifies the user under whose account the <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</b> is run. It is recommended to use a
       dedicated user that has no other role on  the  host  than  running  authorized  principals  commands.  If
       <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</b>  is  specified  but <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser</b> is not, then <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) will
       refuse to start.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b>
       Specifies a file that lists principal names that are accepted for certificate authentication. When  using
       certificates  signed by a key listed in <b>TrustedUserCAKeys</b> this file lists names, one of which must appear
       in the certificate for it to be accepted for authentication. Names are listed one per  line  preceded  by
       key  options  (as described in <u>AUTHORIZED_KEYS</u> <u>FILE</u> <u>FORMAT</u> in <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8)). Empty lines and comments starting
       with '#' are ignored.

       Arguments to <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b> accept the tokens described in the <u>TOKENS</u> section. After expansion,
       <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b> is taken to be an absolute path or one relative to the  user's  home  directory.
       The  default  is  <b>none</b>  i.e.  not  to use a principals file - in this case, the username of the user must
       appear in a certificate's principals list for it to be accepted.

       Note that <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b> is only used  when  authentication  proceeds  using  a  CA  listed  in
       <b>TrustedUserCAKeys</b>  and  is not consulted for certification authorities trusted via <a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a>
       though the <b>principals=</b> key option offers a similar facility (see <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) for  details).   <u>Optional.</u>  <u>Type</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           none

   <b>Banner</b>
       The  contents  of the specified file are sent to the remote user before authentication is allowed. If the
       argument is <b>none</b> then no banner is displayed.  By  default,  no  banner  is  displayed.   <u>Optional.</u>  <u>Type</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>CASignatureAlgorithms</b>
       Specifies  which algorithms are allowed for signing of certificates by certificate authorities (CAs). The
       default    is:    ssh-ed25519,     ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,     ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,     ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
       <a href="mailto:sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com">sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com</a>, <a href="mailto:sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com">sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com</a>, rsa-sha2-512, rsa-sha2-256

       If  the specified list begins with a '+' character, then the specified algorithms will be appended to the
       default set instead of replacing them. If the specified list  begins  with  a  '-'  character,  then  the
       specified  algorithms  (including  wildcards)  will  be removed from the default set instead of replacing
       them.

       Certificates  signed  using  other  algorithms  will  not  be  accepted  for  public  key  or  host-based
       authentication.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ChannelTimeout</b>
       Specifies  whether and how quickly <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) should close inactive channels.  Timeouts are specified as one
       or more ''type=interval'' pairs separated by whitespace, where the ''type'' must be the  special  keyword
       ''global'' or a channel type name from the list below, optionally containing wildcard characters.

       The timeout value ''interval'' is specified in seconds or may use any of the units documented in the <u>TIME</u>
       <u>FORMATS</u>  section.  For  example,  ''session=5m'' would cause interactive sessions to terminate after five
       minutes of inactivity.  Specifying a zero value disables the inactivity timeout.

       The special timeout ''global'' applies to all active channels, taken together.   Traffic  on  any  active
       channel  will reset the timeout, but when the timeout expires then all open channels will be closed. Note
       that this global timeout is not matched by wildcards and must be specified explicitly.

       The available channel type names include:

       <b>agent-connection</b> Open connections to ssh-agent1. <b>direct-tcpip</b> <b>,</b> <b><a href="mailto:direct-streamlocal@openssh.com">direct-streamlocal@openssh.com</a></b>  Open  TCP
       or Unix socket (respectively) connections that have been established from a <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) local forwarding, i.e.
       <b>LocalForward</b>  or  <b>DynamicForward</b>  <b>forwarded-tcpip</b>  <b>,</b>  <b><a href="mailto:forwarded-streamlocal@openssh.com">forwarded-streamlocal@openssh.com</a></b>  Open TCP or Unix
       socket (respectively) connections that have been established to a <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) listening on behalf of a <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1)
       remote forwarding, i.e. <b>RemoteForward</b> <b>session</b> The interactive  main  session,  including  shell  session,
       command  execution,  <b><a href="../man1/scp.1.html">scp</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/sftp.1.html">sftp</a></b>(1), etc. <b>tun-connection</b> Open <b>TunnelForward</b> connections.  <b>x11-connection</b>
       Open X11 forwarding sessions.

       Note that in all the above cases, terminating an inactive  session  does  not  guarantee  to  remove  all
       resources  associated  with  the session, e.g. shell processes or X11 clients relating to the session may
       continue to execute.

       Moreover, terminating an inactive channel or session does not necessarily close the SSH  connection,  nor
       does  it  prevent  a  client from requesting another channel of the same type. In particular, expiring an
       inactive forwarding session does  not  prevent  another  identical  forwarding  from  being  subsequently
       created.

       The default is not to expire channels of any type for inactivity.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ChrootDirectory</b>
       Specifies  the  pathname of a directory to <b><a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</a></b>(2) to after authentication.  At session startup <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8)
       checks that all components of the pathname are root-owned directories which are not writable by group  or
       others.  After the chroot, <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) changes the working directory to the user's home directory.  Arguments
       to <b>ChrootDirectory</b> accept the tokens described in the <u>TOKENS</u> section.

       The <b>ChrootDirectory</b> must contain the necessary files and directories to support the user's  session.  For
       an  interactive  session  this  requires  at least a shell, typically <b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1), and basic <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a> nodes such as
       <b><a href="../man4/null.4.html">null</a></b>(4), <b><a href="../man4/zero.4.html">zero</a></b>(4), <b><a href="../man4/stdin.4.html">stdin</a></b>(4), <b><a href="../man4/stdout.4.html">stdout</a></b>(4), <b><a href="../man4/stderr.4.html">stderr</a></b>(4), and <b><a href="../man4/tty.4.html">tty</a></b>(4) devices. For file  transfer  sessions  using
       SFTP  no  additional configuration of the environment is necessary if the in-process sftp-server is used,
       though sessions which use logging may require /dev/log inside the  chroot  directory  on  some  operating
       systems (see sftp-server8 for details).

       For  safety,  it  is  very important that the directory hierarchy be prevented from modification by other
       processes on the system (especially  those  outside  the  jail).  Misconfiguration  can  lead  to  unsafe
       environments which <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) cannot detect.

       The default is <b>none</b> indicating not to <b><a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</a></b>(2).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           none

   <b>ClientAliveCountMax</b>
       Sets  the  number  of client alive messages which may be sent without <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) receiving any messages back
       from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive  messages  are  being  sent,  sshd  will
       disconnect  the  client,  terminating  the  session. It is important to note that the use of client alive
       messages is very different from <b>TCPKeepAlive</b> The client alive messages are  sent  through  the  encrypted
       channel  and  therefore  will  not  be  spoofable.  The  TCP  keepalive option enabled by <b>TCPKeepAlive</b> is
       spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server  depend  on  knowing  when  a
       connection has become unresponsive.

       The  default  value  is  3.  If  <b>ClientAliveInterval</b> is set to 15, and <b>ClientAliveCountMax</b> is left at the
       default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45  seconds.  Setting  a  zero
       <b>ClientAliveCountMax</b> disables connection termination.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>integer.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           3

   <b>ClientAliveInterval</b>
       Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) will
       send  a  message  through  the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0,
       indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>integer.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           0

   <b>DenyGroups</b>
       This keyword can be followed by a list of group name patterns, separated by spaces. Login  is  disallowed
       for  users  whose primary group or supplementary group list matches one of the patterns. Only group names
       are valid; a numerical group ID is not recognized. By default, login  is  allowed  for  all  groups.  The
       allow/deny groups directives are processed in the following order: <b>DenyGroups</b> <b>AllowGroups</b>

       See  PATTERNS  in ssh_config5 for more information on patterns. This keyword may appear multiple times in
       <b>sshd_config</b> with each instance appending to the list.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>DenyUsers</b>
       This keyword can be followed by a list of user name patterns, separated by spaces.  Login  is  disallowed
       for  user  names  that  match  one of the patterns. Only user names are valid; a numerical user ID is not
       recognized. By default, login is allowed for all users. If the pattern takes the form USER@HOST then USER
       and HOST are separately checked, restricting logins to  particular  users  from  particular  hosts.  HOST
       criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen format. The allow/deny users
       directives are processed in the following order: <b>DenyUsers</b> <b>AllowUsers</b>

       See  PATTERNS  in ssh_config5 for more information on patterns. This keyword may appear multiple times in
       <b>sshd_config</b> with each instance appending to the list.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>DisableForwarding</b>
       Disables all forwarding features, including X11, ssh-agent1, TCP and StreamLocal. This  option  overrides
       all other forwarding-related options and may simplify restricted configurations.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ExposeAuthInfo</b>
       Writes  a  temporary  file containing a list of authentication methods and public credentials (e.g. keys)
       used to authenticate the user. The location of the file is  exposed  to  the  user  session  through  the
       <b>SSH_USER_AUTH</b> environment variable. The default is <b>no</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>ForceCommand</b>
       Forces the execution of the command specified by <b>ForceCommand</b> ignoring any command supplied by the client
       and <a href="file:~/.ssh/rc">~/.ssh/rc</a> if present. The command is invoked by using the user's login shell with the -c option. This
       applies  to  shell,  command, or subsystem execution. It is most useful inside a <b>Match</b> block. The command
       originally supplied by  the  client  is  available  in  the  <b>SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND</b>  environment  variable.
       Specifying  a  command  of <b>internal-sftp</b> will force the use of an in-process SFTP server that requires no
       support files when used with <b>ChrootDirectory</b> The default is <b>none</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           none

   <b>GatewayPorts</b>
       Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to ports forwarded  for  the  client.  By  default,
       <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8)  binds  remote  port  forwardings  to the loopback address. This prevents other remote hosts from
       connecting to forwarded ports. <b>GatewayPorts</b> can be used to specify that sshd  should  allow  remote  port
       forwardings  to bind to non-loopback addresses, thus allowing other hosts to connect. The argument may be
       <b>no</b> to force remote port forwardings to be available to the local host only,  <b>yes</b>  to  force  remote  port
       forwardings to bind to the wildcard address, or <b>clientspecified</b> to allow the client to select the address
       to  which  the  forwarding  is  bound. The default is <b>no</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'clientspecified',</u>
       <u>'no',</u> <u>'yes'.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>GSSAPIAuthentication</b>

       must be one of the following forms:

       <b>PermitListen</b> <u>port</u> <b>PermitListen</b> <u>host</u> <u>:</u> <u>port</u>

       Multiple  permissions may be specified by separating them with whitespace. An argument of <b>any</b> can be used
       to remove all restrictions and permit any listen requests. An argument of <b>none</b> can be  used  to  prohibit
       all  listen  requests.   The  host  name  may  contain  wildcards as described in the PATTERNS section in
       ssh_config5. The wildcard '*' can also be used in place of a port number to allow all ports.  By  default
       all  port  forwarding  listen  requests  are  permitted.   Note  that the <b>GatewayPorts</b> option may further
       restrict which addresses may be listened on. Note  also  that  <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1)  will  request  a  listen  host  of

       Multiple  forwards may be specified by separating them with whitespace. An argument of <b>any</b> can be used to
       remove all restrictions and permit any forwarding requests. An argument of <b>none</b> can be used  to  prohibit
       all  forwarding  requests.  The  wildcard  '*'  can  be used for host or port to allow all hosts or ports
       respectively. Otherwise, no pattern matching or address lookups  are  performed  on  supplied  names.  By
       default all port forwarding requests are permitted.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>PermitRootLogin</b>
       Specifies  whether  root  can  log  in  using  <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1). The argument must be <b>yes</b> <b>prohibit-password</b> <b>forced-</b>

       Sets  one  or  more  public  key  authentication  options. The supported keywords are: <b>none</b> (the default;
       indicating no additional options are enabled), <b>touch-required</b> and <b>verify-required</b>

       The <b>touch-required</b> option causes public key authentication using a  FIDO  authenticator  algorithm  (i.e.
       <b>ecdsa-sk</b>  or  <b>ed25519-sk</b>  to  always  require  the  signature  to  attest  that a physically present user
       explicitly confirmed the authentication (usually by touching  the  authenticator).  By  default,  <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8)
       requires user presence unless overridden with an authorized_keys option. The <b>touch-required</b> flag disables
       this override.

       The  <b>verify-required</b>  option  requires a FIDO key signature attest that the user was verified, e.g. via a
       PIN.

       Neither the <b>touch-required</b> or <b>verify-required</b> options have any effect for  other,  non-FIDO,  public  key

           yes

   <b>RefuseConnection</b>
       Indicates that <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) should unconditionally terminate the connection.  Additionally, a <b>refuseconnection</b>
       penalty  may  be  recorded  against  the source of the connection if <b>PerSourcePenalties</b> are enabled. This
       option is only really useful in a <b>Match</b> block.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RekeyLimit</b>
       Specifies the maximum amount of data that may be transmitted  or  received  before  the  session  key  is
       renegotiated,  optionally  followed  by  a maximum amount of time that may pass before the session key is
       renegotiated. The first argument is specified in bytes and may have  a  suffix  of  'K'  'M'  or  'G'  to
       indicate Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively. The default is between '1G' and '4G' depending
       on  the cipher. The optional second value is specified in seconds and may use any of the units documented
       in the <u>TIME</u> <u>FORMATS</u> section.  The default value for <b>RekeyLimit</b> is <b>default</b> <b>none</b> which means that  rekeying
       is  performed  after  the  cipher's  default  amount  of data has been sent or received and no time based
       rekeying is done.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RevokedKeys</b>
       Specifies revoked public keys file, or <b>none</b> to not use one. Keys listed in this file will be refused  for
       public key authentication. Note that if this file is not readable, then public key authentication will be
       refused  for  all users.  Keys may be specified as a text file, listing one public key per line, or as an
       OpenSSH Key Revocation List (KRL) as generated by ssh-keygen1. For more information on KRLs, see the  KEY
       REVOCATION LISTS section in ssh-keygen1.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SetEnv</b>
       Specifies one or more environment variables to set in child sessions started by <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) as ''NAME=VALUE''
       The  environment  value  may be quoted (e.g. if it contains whitespace characters). Environment variables
       set by <b>SetEnv</b> override the default environment and any variables specified by the user via  <b>AcceptEnv</b>  or
       <b>PermitUserEnvironment</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>StreamLocalBindMask</b>
       Sets  the octal file creation mode mask (umask) used when creating a Unix-domain socket file for local or
       remote port forwarding. This option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.

       The default value is 0177, which creates a Unix-domain socket file that is readable and writable only  by
       the  owner.  Note  that  not  all  operating  systems  honor  the  file mode on Unix-domain socket files.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>StreamLocalBindUnlink</b>
       Specifies whether to remove an existing Unix-domain socket file  for  local  or  remote  port  forwarding
       before  creating  a  new one. If the socket file already exists and <b>StreamLocalBindUnlink</b> is not enabled,
       <b>sshd</b> will be unable to forward the port to the Unix-domain socket file. This option is only used for port
       forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.

       The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> The default is <b>no</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>TrustedUserCAKeys</b>
       Specifies a file containing public keys  of  certificate  authorities  that  are  trusted  to  sign  user
       certificates  for  authentication,  or <b>none</b> to not use one. Keys are listed one per line; empty lines and
       comments starting with '#' are allowed. If a certificate is presented  for  authentication  and  has  its
       signing  CA  key  listed  in this file, then it may be used for authentication for any user listed in the
       certificate's principals list. Note that certificates  that  lack  a  list  of  principals  will  not  be
       permitted  for  authentication  using  <b>TrustedUserCAKeys</b>  For  more  details  on  certificates,  see  the
       CERTIFICATES section in ssh-keygen1.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>UnusedConnectionTimeout</b>
       Specifies whether and how quickly <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) should close client connections with  no  open  channels.  Open
       channels  include active shell, command execution or subsystem sessions, connected network, socket, agent
       or X11 forwardings.  Forwarding listeners, such as those from the <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) -<b>R</b> flag, are not  considered  as
       open channels and do not prevent the timeout. The timeout value is specified in seconds or may use any of
       the units documented in the <u>TIME</u> <u>FORMATS</u> section.

       Note  that  this  timeout  starts when the client connection completes user authentication but before the
       client has an opportunity to open any channels.  Caution should be used when using short timeout  values,
       as  they  may  not  provide  sufficient  time  for  the  client  to  request and open its channels before
       terminating the connection.

       The default <b>none</b> is to never expire connections for having no open channels.  This option may  be  useful
       in conjunction with <b>ChannelTimeout</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>X11DisplayOffset</b>
       Specifies  the  first  display  number available for <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8)Ns's X11 forwarding.  This prevents sshd from
       interfering with real X11 servers. The default is 10.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>X11Forwarding</b>
       Specifies whether X11 forwarding is permitted. The argument must be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> The default is <b>no</b>

       When X11 forwarding is enabled, there may be additional exposure to the server and to client displays  if
       the  <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8)  proxy display is configured to listen on the wildcard address (see <b>X11UseLocalhost</b> <b>)</b> though
       this is not the default. Additionally, the authentication spoofing and authentication  data  verification
       and substitution occur on the client side. The security risk of using X11 forwarding is that the client's
       X11 display server may be exposed to attack when the SSH client requests forwarding (see the warnings for
       <b>ForwardX11</b>  in  ssh_config5).  A  system  administrator  may  have a stance in which they want to protect
       clients that may expose themselves to attack by unwittingly requesting X11 forwarding, which can  warrant
       a <b>no</b> setting.

       Note  that  disabling  X11  forwarding  does  not prevent users from forwarding X11 traffic, as users can
       always install their own forwarders.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :

   <b>X11UseLocalhost</b>
       Specifies whether <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) should bind the X11 forwarding  server  to  the  loopback  address  or  to  the
       wildcard  address.  By  default,  sshd  binds  the forwarding server to the loopback address and sets the
       hostname part of the <b>DISPLAY</b> environment variable to <b>localhost</b> This prevents remote hosts from connecting
       to the proxy display. However,  some  older  X11  clients  may  not  function  with  this  configuration.
       <b>X11UseLocalhost</b>  may  be  set to <b>no</b> to specify that the forwarding server should be bound to the wildcard

   <b>ListenAddress</b>
       Specifies the local addresses <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) should listen on. The following forms may be used:

       enabled by default.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>MACs</b>
       Specifies the available MAC (message authentication code) algorithms.

       The  MAC algorithm is used for data integrity protection. Multiple algorithms must be comma-separated. If

   <b>Match</b>
       Introduces a conditional block. If all of the criteria on the <b>Match</b> line are satisfied, the  keywords  on
       the  following  lines  override  those set in the global section of the config file, until either another
       <b>Match</b> line or the end of the file. If a keyword appears in multiple <b>Match</b> blocks that are satisfied, only
       the first instance of the keyword is applied.

       The arguments to <b>Match</b> are one or more criteria-pattern pairs or one of the single  token  criteria:  <b>All</b>
       which matches all criteria, or <b>Invalid-User</b> which matches when the requested user-name does not match any
       known account.  The available criteria are <b>User</b> <b>Group</b> <b>Host</b> <b>LocalAddress</b> <b>LocalPort</b> and <b>Address</b>

       The  match  patterns  may consist of single entries or comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and
       negation operators described in the <u>PATTERNS</u> section of ssh_config5.

       The patterns in an <b>Address</b> criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in  CIDR  address/masklen
       format,  such  as  192.0.2.0/24  or 2001:db8::/32.  Note that the mask length provided must be consistent
       with the address - it is an error to specify a mask length that is too long for the address or  one  with
       bits set in this host portion of the address. For example, 192.0.2.0/33 and 192.0.2.0/8, respectively.

       Only  a  subset  of  keywords  may be used on the lines following a <b>Match</b> keyword. Available keywords are

   <b>MaxStartups</b>
       Specifies  the  maximum  number  of  concurrent unauthenticated connections to the SSH daemon. Additional
       connections will be dropped until authentication succeeds or the <b>LoginGraceTime</b> expires for a connection.
       The default is 10:30:100.

       Alternatively, random early  drop  can  be  enabled  by  specifying  the  three  colon  separated  values
       start:rate:full (e.g. "10:30:60"). <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) will refuse connection attempts with a probability of rate/100
       (30%)  if  there are currently start (10) unauthenticated connections. The probability increases linearly
       and all connection attempts are refused if the number of unauthenticated connections reaches  full  (60).
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           10

   <b>ModuliFile</b>
       Specifies    the    <b><a href="../man5/moduli.5.html">moduli</a></b>(5)   file   that   contains   the   Diffie-Hellman   groups   used   for   the
       ''diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1'' and ''diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256'' key exchange methods.
       The default is /etc/ssh/moduli.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           <a href="file:/etc/ssh/moduli">/etc/ssh/moduli</a>

   <b>PermitUserEnvironment</b>
       Specifies whether <a href="file:~/.ssh/environment">~/.ssh/environment</a> and <b>environment=</b> options in <a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a> are processed  by
       <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8). Valid options are <b>yes</b> <b>no</b> or a pattern-list specifying which environment variable names to accept
       (for  example  Qq  LANG,  LC_*  ) . The default is <b>no</b> Enabling environment processing may enable users to
       bypass access restrictions in some configurations using mechanisms such  as  <b>LD_PRELOAD</b>   <u>Optional.</u>  <u>Type</u>
       <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>PerSourceMaxStartups</b>
       Specifies  the  number of unauthenticated connections allowed from a given source address, or ''none'' if
       there is no limit. This limit is applied in addition to <b>MaxStartups</b> whichever is lower.  The  default  is
       <b>none</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           none

   <b>PerSourceNetBlockSize</b>
       Specifies  the  number  of  bits of source address that are grouped together for the purposes of applying
       PerSourceMaxStartups limits. Values for IPv4 and optionally IPv6 may be specified, separated by a  colon.
       The default is <b>32:128</b> which means each address is considered individually.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           32:128

   <b>PerSourcePenalties</b>
       Controls penalties for various conditions that may represent attacks on <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8). If a penalty is enforced
       against  a  client  then  its  source  address  and  any  others  in  the  same  network,  as  defined by
       <b>PerSourceNetBlockSize</b> will be refused connection for a period.

       A penalty doesn't affect concurrent connections in progress, but multiple penalties from the same  source
       from  concurrent connections will accumulate up to a maximum. Conversely, penalties are not applied until
       a minimum threshold time has been accumulated.

       Penalties are enabled by default with the default settings listed below but may  disabled  using  the  <b>no</b>
       keyword.  The  defaults  may  be overridden by specifying one or more of the keywords below, separated by
       whitespace. All keywords accept arguments, e.g. Qq crash:2m .

       <b>crash:duration</b> Specifies how  long  to  refuse  clients  that  cause  a  crash  of  <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8)(default:90s).
       <b>authfail:duration</b>  Specifies  how  long  to  refuse  clients  that  disconnect  after  making one or more
       unsuccessful authentication attempts (default:  5s).  <b>refuseconnection:duration</b>  Specifies  how  long  to
       refuse clients that were administratively prohibited connection via the <b>RefuseConnection</b> option (default:
       10s).   <b>noauth:duration</b>  Specifies  how  long  to  refuse  clients  that  disconnect  without  attempting
       authentication (default: 1s). This timeout should be used cautiously otherwise it may penalise legitimate
       scanning tools such as ssh-keyscan1. <b>grace-exceeded:duration</b> Specifies how long to  refuse  clients  that
       fail  to  authenticate  after  <b>LoginGraceTime</b>  (default:  10s). <b>max:duration</b> Specifies the maximum time a
       particular source address range will be refused access  for  (default:  10m).   Repeated  penalties  will
       accumulate  up  to  this  maximum.  <b>min:duration</b>  Specifies  the  minimum penalty that must accrue before
       enforcement begins (default: 15s). <b>max-sources4:number</b> <b>,</b> <b>max-sources6:number</b> Specifies the maximum number
       of client IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges to track for penalties (default: 65536  for  both).  <b>overflow:mode</b>
       Controls  how  the  server behaves when <b>max-sources4</b> or <b>max-sources6</b> is exceeded. There are two operating
       modes:   <b>deny-all</b>   which   denies   all   incoming   connections   other   than   those   exempted   via
       <b>PerSourcePenaltyExemptList</b>  until  a  penalty  expires,  and  <b>permissive</b>  which allows new connections by
       removing existing penalties early (default:  permissive).  Note  that  client  penalties  below  the  <b>min</b>
       threshold  count  against  the  total  number  of  tracked penalties. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are tracked
       separately, so an overflow in one  will  not  affect  the  other.   <b>overflow6:mode</b>  Allows  specifying  a
       different overflow mode for IPv6 addresses. The default it to use the same overflow mode as was specified
       for IPv4.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>PerSourcePenaltyExemptList</b>
       Specifies  a  comma-separated list of addresses to exempt from penalties. This list may contain wildcards
       and CIDR address/masklen ranges. Note that the mask length provided must be consistent with the address -
       it is an error to specify a mask length that is too long for the address or one with  bits  set  in  this
       host  portion of the address. For example, 192.0.2.0/33 and 192.0.2.0/8, respectively. The default is not
       to exempt any addresses.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>PidFile</b>
       Specifies the file that contains the process ID of the SSH daemon, or <b>none</b> to not write one. The  default
       is /run/sshd.pid.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           /run/sshd

   <b>Port</b>
       Specifies  the port number that <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) listens on. The default is 22.  Multiple options of this type are
       permitted. See also <b>ListenAddress</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>PrintLastLog</b>
       Specifies whether <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) should print the date and time of the last user  login  when  a  user  logs  in
       interactively. The default is <b>yes</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   <b>PrintMotd</b>
       Specifies  whether  <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) should print /etc/motd when a user logs in interactively. (On some systems it
       is also printed by the shell, <a href="file:/etc/profile">/etc/profile</a> or equivalent.) The default is <b>yes</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   <b>RequiredRSASize</b>
       Specifies the minimum RSA key size (in bits) that <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) will accept. User and host-based authentication
       keys smaller than this limit will be refused. The default is <b>1024</b> bits. Note that this limit may only  be
       raised from the default.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>integer.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           1024

   <b>SecurityKeyProvider</b>
       Specifies  a  path to a library that will be used when loading FIDO authenticator-hosted keys, overriding
       the default of using the built-in USB HID support.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SshdSessionPath</b>
       Overrides the default path to the <b>sshd-session</b> binary that is invoked  to  handle  each  connection.  The
       default  is  /usr/lib/openssh/sshd-session  This  option  is  intended  for use by tests.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           /usr/lib/openssh/sshd

   <b>StrictModes</b>
       Specifies whether <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) should check file modes and ownership of the user's files  and  home  directory
       before  accepting  login.  This  is normally desirable because novices sometimes accidentally leave their
       directory or files world-writable. The default is <b>yes</b> Note that this does not  apply  to  <b>ChrootDirectory</b>
       whose permissions and ownership are checked unconditionally.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   <b>Subsystem</b>
       Configures  an external subsystem (e.g. file transfer daemon). Arguments should be a subsystem name and a
       command (with optional arguments) to execute upon subsystem request.

       The command <b>sftp-server</b> implements the SFTP file transfer subsystem.

       Alternately  the  name  <b>internal-sftp</b>  implements  an  in-process  SFTP  server.    This   may   simplify
       configurations using <b>ChrootDirectory</b> to force a different filesystem root on clients. It accepts the same
       command  line  arguments  as  <b>sftp-server</b>  and even though it is in-process, settings such as <b>LogLevel</b> or
       <b>SyslogFacility</b> do not apply to it and must be set explicitly via command line arguments.

       By default no subsystems are defined.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>hash</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SyslogFacility</b>
       Gives the facility code that is used when logging messages from <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8). The possible values are: DAEMON,
       USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2,  LOCAL3,  LOCAL4,  LOCAL5,  LOCAL6,  LOCAL7.  The  default  is  AUTH.
       <u>Optional.</u>  <u>Type</u>  <u>enum.</u>  <u>choice:</u>  <u>'AUTH',</u>  <u>'DAEMON',</u>  <u>'LOCAL0',</u>  <u>'LOCAL1',</u>  <u>'LOCAL2',</u>  <u>'LOCAL3',</u> <u>'LOCAL4',</u>
       <u>'LOCAL5',</u> <u>'LOCAL6',</u> <u>'LOCAL7',</u> <u>'USER'.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           AUTH

   <b>TCPKeepAlive</b>
       Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the other  side.  If  they  are  sent,
       death  of  the  connection  or crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed. However, this means
       that connections will die if the route is down temporarily, and some people  find  it  annoying.  On  the
       other  hand,  if  TCP  keepalives  are not sent, sessions may hang indefinitely on the server, leaving Qq
       ghost users and consuming server resources.

       The default is <b>yes</b> (to send TCP keepalive messages), and the server will notice if the network goes  down
       or the client host crashes. This avoids infinitely hanging sessions.

       To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to <b>no</b>

       This option was formerly called <b>KeepAlive</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   <b>UseDNS</b>
       Specifies  whether  <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) should look up the remote host name, and to check that the resolved host name
       for the remote IP address maps back to the very same IP address.

       If this option is set to <b>no</b> (the default) then  only  addresses  and  not  host  names  may  be  used  in
       <a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a> <b>from</b> and <b>sshd_config</b> <b>Match</b> <b>Host</b> directives.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>UsePAM</b>
       Enables  the Pluggable Authentication Module interface. If set to <b>yes</b> this will enable PAM authentication
       using <b>KbdInteractiveAuthentication</b> and <b>PasswordAuthentication</b> in addition  to  PAM  account  and  session
       module processing for all authentication types.

       Because   PAM   keyboard-interactive  authentication  usually  serves  an  equivalent  role  to  password
       authentication, you should disable either <b>PasswordAuthentication</b> or <b>KbdInteractiveAuthentication</b>

       If <b>UsePAM</b> is enabled, you will not be able to  run  <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8)  as  a  non-root  user.  The  default  is  <b>no</b>
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           no

   <b>VersionAddendum</b>
       Optionally  specifies  additional  text  to  append  to  the  SSH protocol banner sent by the server upon
       connection. The default is <b>none</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>XAuthLocation</b>
       Specifies the full  pathname  of  the  <b><a href="../man1/xauth.1.html">xauth</a></b>(1)  program,  or  <b>none</b>  to  not  use  one.  The  default  is
       /usr/bin/xauth.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?xauth">/usr/bin/xauth</a>
