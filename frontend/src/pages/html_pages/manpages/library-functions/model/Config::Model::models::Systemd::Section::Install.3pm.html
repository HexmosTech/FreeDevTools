</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Config::Model::models::Systemd::Section::Install - Configuration class Systemd::Section::Install

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration classes used by Config::Model

</pre><h4><b>Elements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Alias</b>
       A space-separated list of additional names this unit shall be installed under. The names listed here must
       have the same suffix (i.e. type) as the unit filename. This option may be specified more than once, in
       which case all listed names are used. At installation time, systemctl enable will create symlinks from
       these names to the unit filename. Note that not all unit types support such alias names, and this setting
       is not supported for them. Specifically, mount, slice, swap, and automount units do not support aliasing.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>WantedBy</b>
       This option may be used more than once, or a space-separated list of unit names may be given. A symbolic
       link is created in the ".wants/", ".requires/", or ".upholds/" directory of each of the listed units when
       this unit is installed by systemctl enable. This has the effect of a dependency of type "Wants",
       "Requires", or "Upholds" being added from the listed unit to the current unit. See the description of the
       mentioned dependency types in the [Unit] section for details.

       In case of template units listing non template units, the listing unit must have "DefaultInstance" set,
       or systemctl enable must be called with an instance name. The instance (default or specified) will be
       added to the ".wants/", ".requires/", or ".upholds/" list of the listed unit. For example,
       WantedBy=getty.target in a service "getty@.service" will result in systemctl enable <a href="mailto:getty@tty2.service">getty@tty2.service</a>
       creating a "getty.target.wants/<a href="mailto:getty@tty2.service">getty@tty2.service</a>" link to "getty@.service". This also applies to listing
       specific instances of templated units: this specific instance will gain the dependency. A template unit
       may also list a template unit, in which case a generic dependency will be added where each instance of
       the listing unit will have a dependency on an instance of the listed template with the same instance
       value. For example, WantedBy=container@.target in a service "monitor@.service" will result in systemctl
       enable monitor@.service creating a "container@.target.wants/monitor@.service" link to "monitor@.service",
       which applies to all instances of "container@.target".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RequiredBy</b>
       This option may be used more than once, or a space-separated list of unit names may be given. A symbolic
       link is created in the ".wants/", ".requires/", or ".upholds/" directory of each of the listed units when
       this unit is installed by systemctl enable. This has the effect of a dependency of type "Wants",
       "Requires", or "Upholds" being added from the listed unit to the current unit. See the description of the
       mentioned dependency types in the [Unit] section for details.

       In case of template units listing non template units, the listing unit must have "DefaultInstance" set,
       or systemctl enable must be called with an instance name. The instance (default or specified) will be
       added to the ".wants/", ".requires/", or ".upholds/" list of the listed unit. For example,
       WantedBy=getty.target in a service "getty@.service" will result in systemctl enable <a href="mailto:getty@tty2.service">getty@tty2.service</a>
       creating a "getty.target.wants/<a href="mailto:getty@tty2.service">getty@tty2.service</a>" link to "getty@.service". This also applies to listing
       specific instances of templated units: this specific instance will gain the dependency. A template unit
       may also list a template unit, in which case a generic dependency will be added where each instance of
       the listing unit will have a dependency on an instance of the listed template with the same instance
       value. For example, WantedBy=container@.target in a service "monitor@.service" will result in systemctl
       enable monitor@.service creating a "container@.target.wants/monitor@.service" link to "monitor@.service",
       which applies to all instances of "container@.target".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>UpheldBy</b>
       This option may be used more than once, or a space-separated list of unit names may be given. A symbolic
       link is created in the ".wants/", ".requires/", or ".upholds/" directory of each of the listed units when
       this unit is installed by systemctl enable. This has the effect of a dependency of type "Wants",
       "Requires", or "Upholds" being added from the listed unit to the current unit. See the description of the
       mentioned dependency types in the [Unit] section for details.

       In case of template units listing non template units, the listing unit must have "DefaultInstance" set,
       or systemctl enable must be called with an instance name. The instance (default or specified) will be
       added to the ".wants/", ".requires/", or ".upholds/" list of the listed unit. For example,
       WantedBy=getty.target in a service "getty@.service" will result in systemctl enable <a href="mailto:getty@tty2.service">getty@tty2.service</a>
       creating a "getty.target.wants/<a href="mailto:getty@tty2.service">getty@tty2.service</a>" link to "getty@.service". This also applies to listing
       specific instances of templated units: this specific instance will gain the dependency. A template unit
       may also list a template unit, in which case a generic dependency will be added where each instance of
       the listing unit will have a dependency on an instance of the listed template with the same instance
       value. For example, WantedBy=container@.target in a service "monitor@.service" will result in systemctl
       enable monitor@.service creating a "container@.target.wants/monitor@.service" link to "monitor@.service",
       which applies to all instances of "container@.target".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Also</b>
       Additional units to install/deinstall when this unit is installed/deinstalled. If the user requests
       installation/deinstallation of a unit with this option configured, systemctl enable and systemctl disable
       will automatically install/uninstall units listed in this option as well.

       This option may be used more than once, or a space-separated list of unit names may be given.  <u>Optional.</u>
       <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>DefaultInstance</b>
       In template unit files, this specifies for which instance the unit shall be enabled if the template is
       enabled without any explicitly set instance. This option has no effect in non-template unit files. The
       specified string must be usable as instance identifier.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>
