</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       RDF::Trine::Model - Model class

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes RDF::Trine::Model version 1.019

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "new ( $store )"
           Returns  a  new  model  over  the  supplied  rdf  store  or a new temporary model.  If you provide an
           unblessed value, it will be used to create a new rdf store.

       "temporary_model"
           Returns a new temporary (non-persistent) model.

       "dataset_model ( default =&gt; \@dgraphs, named =&gt; \@ngraphs )"
           Returns a new model object with the default graph  mapped  to  the  union  of  the  graphs  named  in
           @dgraphs, and with available named graphs named in @ngraphs.

       "begin_bulk_ops"
           Provides  a  hint to the backend that many update operations are about to occur.  The backend may use
           this hint to, for example, aggregate  many  operations  into  a  single  operation,  or  delay  index
           maintenence.  After  the  update  operations  have  been executed, "end_bulk_ops" should be called to
           ensure the updates are committed to the backend.

       "end_bulk_ops"
           Provides a hint to the backend that a set of bulk operations have been completed and may be committed
           to the backend.

       "logger ( [ $logger ] )"
           Returns the logging object responsible for recording data inserts and deletes.

           If $logger is passed as an argument, sets the logger to this object.

       "add_statement ( $statement [, $context] )"
           Adds the specified $statement to the rdf store.

       "add_hashref ( $hashref [, $context] )"
           Add triples represented in an RDF/JSON-like manner to the model.

           See "as_hashref" for full documentation of the hashref format.

       "add_iterator ( $iter )"
           Add triples from the statement iterator to the model.

       "add_list ( @elements )"
           Adds an rdf:List to the model with the given elements. Returns the node object that is  the  head  of
           the list.

       "get_list ( $head )"
           Returns a list of nodes that are elements of the rdf:List represented by the supplied head node.

       "remove_list ( $head [, orphan_check =&gt; 1] )"
           Removes  the nodes of type rdf:List that make up the list. Optionally checks each node before removal
           to make sure that it is not used in any other statements. Returns  false  if  the  list  was  removed
           completely; returns the first remaining node if the removal was abandoned because of an orphan check.

       "get_sequence ( $seq )"
           Returns a list of nodes that are elements of the rdf:Seq sequence.

       "remove_statement ( $statement [, $context])"
           Removes the specified $statement from the rdf store.

       "remove_statements ( $subject, $predicate, $object [, $context] )"
           Removes all statements matching the supplied $statement pattern from the rdf store.

       "size"
           Returns the number of statements in the model.

       "etag"
           If  the  model  is  based  on  a store that has the capability and knowledge to support caching, this
           method returns a persistent token that will remain consistent as long as  the  store's  data  doesn't
           change. This token is acceptable for use as an HTTP ETag.

       "supports ( [ $feature ] )"
           If  $feature  is  specified,  returns true if the feature is supported by the underlying store, false
           otherwise. If $feature is not specified, returns a list of supported features.

       "count_statements ( $subject, $predicate, $object )"
           Returns a count of all the statements matching the specified subject, predicate and objects.  Any  of
           the arguments may be undef to match any value.

       "get_statements ($subject, $predicate, $object [, $context] )"
           Returns  an iterator of all statements matching the specified subject, predicate and objects from the
           rdf store. Any of the arguments may be undef to match any value.

           If three or fewer arguments are given, the statements  returned  will  be  matched  based  on  triple
           semantics  (the  graph union of triples from all the named graphs). If four arguments are given (even
           if $context is undef), statements will be matched based on quad semantics (the union of all quads  in
           the underlying store).

       "get_pattern ( $bgp [, $context] [, %args ] )"
           Returns a stream object of all bindings matching the specified graph pattern.

           If $context is given, restricts BGP matching to only quads with the $context value.

           %args  may contain an 'orderby' key-value pair to request a specific ordering based on variable name.
           The value for the 'orderby' key should be an ARRAY reference containing variable name  and  direction
           ('ASC' or 'DESC') tuples.  A valid %args hash, therefore, might look like "orderby =&gt; [qw(name ASC)]"
           (corresponding to a SPARQL-like request to 'ORDER BY ASC(?name)').

       "get_sparql ( $sparql )"
           Returns a stream object of all bindings matching the specified graph pattern.

       "get_graphs"
       "get_contexts"
           Returns an iterator containing the nodes representing the named graphs in the model.

       "as_stream"
           Returns an iterator containing every statement in the model.

       "as_hashref"
           Returns a hashref representing the model in an RDF/JSON-like manner.

           A graph like this (in Turtle):

             @prefix ex: &lt;<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>&gt; .

             ex:subject1
               ex:predicate1
                 "Foo"@en ,
                 "Bar"^^ex:datatype1 .

             _:bnode1
               ex:predicate2
                 ex:object2 ;
               ex:predicate3 ;
                 _:bnode3 .

           Is represented like this as a hashref:

             {
               "<a href="http://example.com/subject1">http://example.com/subject1</a>" =&gt; {
                 "<a href="http://example.com/predicate1">http://example.com/predicate1</a>" =&gt; [
                   { 'type'=&gt;'literal', 'value'=&gt;"Foo", 'lang'=&gt;"en" },
                   { 'type'=&gt;'literal', 'value'=&gt;"Bar", 'datatype'=&gt;"<a href="http://example.com/datatype1">http://example.com/datatype1</a>" },
                 ],
               },
               "_:bnode1" =&gt; {
                 "<a href="http://example.com/predicate2">http://example.com/predicate2</a>" =&gt; [
                   { 'type'=&gt;'uri', 'value'=&gt;"<a href="http://example.com/object2">http://example.com/object2</a>" },
                 ],
                 "<a href="http://example.com/predicate2">http://example.com/predicate2</a>" =&gt; [
                   { 'type'=&gt;'bnode', 'value'=&gt;"_:bnode3" },
                 ],
               },
             }

           Note  that  the  type of subjects (resource or blank node) is indicated entirely by the convention of
           starting blank nodes with "_:".

           This hashref structure is compatible with RDF/JSON and with the ARC2 library for PHP.

       "as_graphviz"
           Returns a GraphViz object of the RDF graph of this model, ignoring graph names/contexts.

           This method will attempt to load the GraphViz module at runtime  and  will  fail  if  the  module  is
           unavailable.

   <b>Node-Centric</b> <b>Graph</b> <b>API</b>
       "subjects ( $predicate, $object )"
           Returns  a  list  of the nodes that appear as the subject of statements with the specified $predicate
           and $object. Either of the two arguments may be undef to signify a wildcard.

       "predicates ( $subject, $object )"
           Returns a list of the nodes that appear as the predicate of statements with  the  specified  $subject
           and $object. Either of the two arguments may be undef to signify a wildcard.

       "objects ( $subject, $predicate [, $graph ] [, %options ] )"
           Returns  a  list of the nodes that appear as the object of statements with the specified $subject and
           $predicate. Either of the two arguments may be undef to signify a wildcard. You  can  further  filter
           objects  using  the  %options  argument.  Keys  in  %options indicate the restriction type and may be
           'type', 'language', or 'datatype'. The value of the 'type' key may be one of 'node', 'nil',  'blank',
           'resource',  'literal', or 'variable'. The use of either 'language' or 'datatype' restrict objects to
           literal nodes with a specific language or datatype value, respectively.

       "objects_for_predicate_list ( $subject, @predicates )"
           Given the RDF::Trine::Node objects $subject and @predicates, finds all matching triples in the  model
           with  the  specified subject and any of the given predicates, and returns a list of object values (in
           the partial order given by the ordering of @predicates).

       "bounded_description ( $node )"
           Returns an RDF::Trine::Iterator::Graph object over the bounded description  triples  for  $node  (all
           triples resulting from a graph traversal starting with "node" and stopping at non-blank nodes).

       "as_string"
