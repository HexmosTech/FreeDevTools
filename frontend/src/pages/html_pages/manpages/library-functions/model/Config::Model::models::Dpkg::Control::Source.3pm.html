       Config::Model::models::Dpkg::Control::Source - Configuration class Dpkg::Control::Source

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration classes used by Config::Model

</pre><h4><b>Elements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Source</b> <b>-</b> <b>source</b> <b>package</b> <b>name</b>
       Source package name. Defaults to the name of the current directory or undef if the directory name does
       not match Debian requirements for a source package.  <u>Mandatory.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       Note: Source is computed with

   <b>debhelper-version</b>
       Debhelper version. This parameter is hidden because it does not exist in control. It's used to drive warp
       mechanism for parameters that  depend on debhelper version.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>integer.</u>

       default value :
           0

   <b>Maintainer</b> <b>-</b> <b>package</b> <b>maintainer's</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>email</b> <b>address</b>
       The  package maintainer's name and email address. The name must come first, then the email address inside
       angle brackets &lt;&gt; (in RFC822 format).

       If the maintainer's name contains a full stop then the whole field will not work  directly  as  an  email
       address  due  to a misfeature in the syntax specified in RFC822; a program using this field as an address
       must check for this and correct the problem if necessary (for  example  by  putting  the  name  in  round
       brackets and moving it to the end, and bringing the email address forward).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       Note: Maintainer is computed with

        my $name = $ENV{DEBFULLNAME};
        my $email = $ENV{DEBEMAIL} ;
        my $ret;
        $ret = "$name &lt;$email&gt;" if $name and $email;
        $ret;

   <b>Standards-Version</b> <b>-</b> <b>Debian</b> <b>policy</b> <b>version</b> <b>number</b> <b>this</b> <b>package</b> <b>complies</b> <b>to</b>
       This field indicates the Debian policy version number this package complies to.

       Before   updating   this   field,  please  read  upgrading-checklist  &lt;https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-
       policy/upgrading-checklist.html&gt; to know what changes came with a new policy version number and apply the
       required changes (if any) to your package.  <u>Mandatory.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Section</b>
       The packages in the archive areas main, contrib  and  non-free  are  grouped  further  into  sections  to
       simplify handling.

       The archive area and section for each package should be specified in the package's Section control record
       (see  Section 5.6.5 &lt;https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#section&gt;).  However, the maintainer of the
       Debian archive may override this selection to ensure the consistency  of  the  Debian  distribution.  The
       Section field should be of the form:

       •   section if the package is in the main archive area,

       •   area/section if the package is in the contrib or non-free archive areas.

        <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Priority</b>
        <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'required',</u> <u>'important',</u> <u>'standard',</u> <u>'optional',</u> <u>'extra'.</u>

       default value :
           optional

       Here are some explanations on the possible values:

       'extra'
           This  contains  all packages that conflict with others with required, important, standard or optional
           priorities, or are only likely to be useful if you already know what they  are  or  have  specialized
           requirements (such as packages containing only detached debugging symbols).

       'important'
           Important  programs,  including  those which one would expect to find on any Unix-like system. If the
           expectation is that an experienced Unix person who found it missing would say "What on earth is going
           on, where is foo?", it must be an important package.[5] Other packages without which the system  will
           not  run  well  or  be  usable  must also have priority important. This does not include Emacs, the X
           Window System, TeX or any other large applications. The important packages are just a bare minimum of
           commonly-expected and necessary tools.

       'optional'
           (In a sense everything that isn't required is optional, but that's not what is meant here.)  This  is
           all  the  software that you might reasonably want to install if you didn't know what it was and don't
           have specialized requirements. This is a much larger system and includes the X Window System, a  full
           TeX  distribution,  and many applications.  Note that optional packages should not conflict with each
           other.

       'required'
           Packages which are necessary for the proper functioning of the system (usually, this means that  dpkg
           functionality  depends  on  these  packages).   Removing  a required package may cause your system to
           become totally broken and you may not even be able to use dpkg to put things back, so only do  so  if
           you know what you are doing.  Systems with only the required packages are probably unusable, but they
           do have enough functionality to allow the sysadmin to boot and install more software.

       'standard'
           These  packages  provide  a  reasonably small but not too limited character-mode system. This is what
           will be installed by default if the user doesn't select anything else. It doesn't include many  large
           applications.

   <b>Build-Depends</b> <b>-</b> <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> <b>required</b> <b>during</b> <b>clean</b> <b>or</b> <b>build</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture-dependent</b> <b>packages</b>
       List of packages that must be installed:

       •   during clean

       •   to build architecture-dependent binaries ("Architecture: any" or specific architectures).

       Technically,  these  packages  must  be installed for the following build targets: clean, build-arch, and
       binary-arch.  See build  target  &lt;https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#relationships-between-source-
       and-binary-packages-build-depends-build-depends-indep-build-depends-arch-build-conflicts-build-conflicts-
       indep-build-conflicts-arch&gt;.

       On the other hand, the list of packages that must be installed to build architecture-independent binaries
       ("Architecture: all") should be listed in "Build-Depends-Indep" field.

       Including  a  dependency in this field does not have the exact same effect as including it in both Build-
       Depends-Arch and Build-Depends-Indep, because the dependency also needs to be satisfied when building the
       source package.

       See also  deb-src-control  &lt;https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/dpkg-dev/deb-src-control.5.en.html&gt;  man
       page.

       This parameter can aslo have restriction formula. For instance:

           Build-Depends: foo (&gt;= 1.0) [i386 arm] &lt;!nocheck&gt; &lt;!cross&gt;, bar

       See               debian               wiki              &lt;https://wiki.debian.org/BuildProfileSpec#Build-
       Depends_syntax_extension_.28restriction_formulas.29&gt; for more details.   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Build-Depends-Arch</b> <b>-</b> <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>architecture-dependent</b> <b>packages</b>
       Same as Build-Depends, but these packages are  only  needed  when  building  the  architecture  dependent
       packages. The Build-Depends are also installed in this case.

       See  deb-src-control  man  page &lt;https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/dpkg-dev/deb-src-control.5.en.html&gt;
       for details.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Build-Depends-Indep</b> <b>-</b> <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> <b>required</b> <b>during</b> <b>build</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture-independent</b> <b>package</b>
       List of packages that must be installed to build architecture-independent binaries ("Architecture: all").

       Technically, these packages must be installed  for  the  following  build  targets:  build,  build-indep,
       binary,  and  binary-indep.   See  build target &lt;https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#relationships-
       between-source-and-binary-packages-build-depends-build-depends-indep-build-depends-arch-build-conflicts-
       build-conflicts-indep-build-conflicts-arch&gt;.

       Note that packages required during "clean" phase must be declared in "Build-Depends" field.

       This parameter can aslo have restriction formula. For instance:

           Build-Depends: foo (&gt;= 1.0) [i386 arm] &lt;!nocheck&gt; &lt;!cross&gt;, bar

       See              debian               wiki               &lt;https://wiki.debian.org/BuildProfileSpec#Build-
       Depends_syntax_extension_.28restriction_formulas.29&gt; for more details.   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Build-Conflicts</b> <b>-</b> <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>during</b> <b>clean</b> <b>or</b> <b>build</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture-dependent</b> <b>packages</b>
       List of packages that must be missing (i.e. <b>not</b> installed):

       •   during clean

       •   to build architecture-dependent binaries ("Architecture: any" or specific architectures).

       Technically, these packages must <b>not</b> be installed for the following build targets: clean, build-arch, and
       binary-arch.   See  build target &lt;https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#relationships-between-source-
       and-binary-packages-build-depends-build-depends-indep-build-depends-arch-build-conflicts-build-conflicts-
       indep-build-conflicts-arch&gt;.

       On the other hand, the list of packages that must <b>not</b>  be  installed  to  build  architecture-independent
       binaries ("Architecture: all") should be listed in "Build-Conflicts-Indep" field.

       Including  a dependency in this list has the same effect as including it in both Build-Conflicts-Arch and
       Build-Conflicts-Indep, with the additional effect of being used for source-only builds.

       See deb-src-control  man  page  &lt;https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/dpkg-dev/deb-src-control.5.en.html&gt;
       for details.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Build-Conflicts-Arch</b> <b>-</b> <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>during</b> <b>build</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>packages</b>
       List of packages that must be missing (i.e. <b>not</b> installed) to build archictecture dependent binaries

       See  deb-src-control  man  page &lt;https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/dpkg-dev/deb-src-control.5.en.html&gt;

   <b>Build-Conflicts-Indep</b> <b>-</b> <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>during</b> <b>build</b> <b>of</b> <b>architecture-independent</b> <b>packages</b>
       List of packages that must be missing (i.e. <b>not</b> installed) to build binaries with arch set to "all.

       Technically, these packages must <b>not</b> be installed for the following build  targets:  build,  build-indep,
       binary,  and  binary-indep.   See  build target &lt;https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#relationships-
       between-source-and-binary-packages-build-depends-build-depends-indep-build-depends-arch-build-conflicts-
       build-conflicts-indep-build-conflicts-arch&gt;.

       Note that packages not  wanted  during  "clean"  phase  must  be  declared  in  "Build-Conflicts"  field.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Built-Using</b> <b>-</b> <b>Additional</b> <b>source</b> <b>packages</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>the</b> <b>binary</b>
        Some binary packages incorporate parts of other packages when built but do not have to depend on those packages. Examples include linking with static libraries
       or incorporating source code from another package during the build. In this case, the source packages of those other packages are a required part of the complete source (the binary package is not reproducible without them).

       A  Built-Using  field must list the corresponding source package for any such binary package incorporated
       during the build, including an <b>exactly</b> <b>equal</b> ("=") version relation on the version that was used to build
       that binary package[57].

       A package using the source code from the gcc-4.6-source binary package  built  from  the  gcc-4.6  source
       package would have this field in its control file:

            Built-Using: gcc-4.6 (= 4.6.0-11)

       A package including binaries from grub2 and loadlin would have this field in its control file:

            Built-Using: grub2 (= 1.99-9), loadlin (= 1.6e-1)
       I&lt; Optional. Type list of uniline.  &gt;

   <b>Vcs-Browser</b> <b>-</b> <b>web-browsable</b> <b>URL</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>VCS</b> <b>repository</b>
       Value  of  this  field  should  be a https:// URL pointing to a web-browsable copy of the Version Control
       System repository used to maintain the given package, if available.

       The information is meant to be useful for the final user, willing to browse the latest work done  on  the
       package  (e.g.  when  looking  for  the patch fixing a bug tagged as pending in the bug tracking system).
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       Note: Vcs-Browser is computed with

   <b>Rules-Requires-Root</b> <b>-</b> <b>Defines</b> <b>if</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>root</b> <b>(or</b> <b>fakeroot)</b> <b>is</b> <b>required</b> <b>during</b> <b>build.</b>
       Depending on the value of the Rules-Requires-Root field, the package builder (e.g. dpkg-buildpackage) may
       run the debian/rules target as an unprivileged user and provide a gain root command.  This command allows
       the  debian/rules  target  to  run particular subcommands under (fake)root. Can be 'no', 'binary-targets'
       (default)), or a space separated list of keywords containing a forward slash (e.g. "/").

       For  details,  see  section  5.6.31.2  of  Debian  policy   &lt;https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-
       controlfields.html#rules-requires-root&gt;  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       Here are some explanations on the possible values:

       '.+/'
           Space separated list of keywords. These keywords must always contain a forward slash, which sets them
           apart from the other possible values of Rules-Requires-Root.  When this list is provided, the builder
           must provide a gain root command (as defined in debian/rules and Rules-Requires-Root) or pretend that
           the  value  was  set  to binary-targets, and both the builder and the packageâs debian/rules script
           must downgrade accordingly.

       'binary-targets'
           (Default) Declares that the package will need the root (or  fakeroot)  when  either  of  the  binary,
           binary-arch or binary-indep targets are called.  This is how every tool behaved before this field was
           defined.

       'no'
           Declares  that  neither  root nor fakeroot is required. Package builders (e.g. dpkg-buildpackage) may
           choose to invoke any target in debian/rules with an unprivileged user.
