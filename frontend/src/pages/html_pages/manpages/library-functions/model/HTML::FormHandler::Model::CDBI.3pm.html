</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTML::FormHandler::Model::CDBI - Class::DBI model class (non-functioning)

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.40068

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package MyApplication::Form::User;
           use strict;
           use base 'HTML::FormHandler::Model::CDBI';

           # Associate this form with a CDBI class
           has '+item_class' =&gt; ( default =&gt; 'MyDB::User' );

           # Define the fields that this form will operate on
           sub field_list {
               return {
                   [
                       name        =&gt; 'Text',
                       age         =&gt; 'PosInteger',
                       sex         =&gt; 'Select',
                       birthdate   =&gt; 'DateTimeDMYHM',
                   ]
               };
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A Class::DBI database model for HTML::FormHandler

       I don't use CDBI, so this module almost certainly doesn't work.  It is only being left here as a starting
       point in case somebody is interested in getting it to work.

       Patches and tests gratefully accepted.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>item_class</b>
       The name of your database class.

   <b>init_item</b>
       This is called first time $form-&gt;item is called.  It does the equivalent of:

           return $self-&gt;item_class-&gt;retrieve( $self-&gt;item_id );

   <b>guess_field_type</b>
       Pass in a column and assigns field types.  Must set $self-&gt;item_class to return the related item class.
       Returns the type in scalar context, returns the type and maybe the related table in list context.

       Currently returns:

           DateTime        - for a has_a relationship that isa DateTime
           Select          - for a has_a relationship
           Multiple        - for a has_many
           DateTime        - if the field ends in _time
           Text            - otherwise

   <b>lookup_options</b>
       Returns a array reference of key/value pairs for the column passed in.  Calls $field-&gt;label_column to get
       the column name to use as the label.  The default is "name".  The labels are sorted by Perl's cmp sort.

       If there is an "active" column then only active are included, with the exception being if the form (item)
       has currently selected the inactive item.  This allows existing records that reference inactive items to
       still have those as valid select options.  The inactive labels are formatted with brackets to indicate in
       the select list that they are inactive.

       The active column name is determined by calling:

           $active_col = $form-&gt;can( 'active_column' )
               ? $form-&gt;active_column
               : $field-&gt;active_column;

       Which allows setting the name of the active column globally if your tables are consistently named (all
       lookup tables have the same column name to indicate they are active), or on a per-field basis.

       In addition, if the foreign class is the same as the item's class (or the class returned by item_class)
       then options pointing to item are excluded.  The reason for this is for a table column that points to the
       same table (self referenced), such as a "parent" column.  The assumption is that a record cannot be its
       own parent.

   <b>init_value</b>
       Populate $field-&gt;value with object ids from the CDBI object.  If the column expands to more than one
       object then an array ref is set.

   <b>validate_model</b>
       Validates fields that are dependent on the model.  Currently, "unique" fields are checked  to make sure
       they are unique.

       This validation happens after other form validation.  The form already has any field values entered in
       $field-&gt;value at this point.

   <b>validate_unique</b>
       Checks that the value for the field is not currently in the database.

   <b>items_same</b>
       Returns true if the two passed in cdbi objects are the same object.  If both are undefined returns true.

   <b>obj_key</b>
       returns a key for a given object, or undef if the object is undefined.
