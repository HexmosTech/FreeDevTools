</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::Fu::File::Temp - temporary files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use File::Fu;
         my $handle = File::Fu-&gt;temp_file;

   <b>new</b>
       The directory argument is required, followed by an optional template argument and/or flags.  The template
       may contain some number of 'X' characters.  If it does not, ten of them will be appended.

         my $handle = File::Fu::File::Temp-&gt;new($dir, 'foo');
         my $file = $handle-&gt;name;

       By default, the file will be deleted when the handle goes out of scope.  Optionally, it may be deleted
       immediately after creation or just not deleted.

         my $handle = File::Fu::File::Temp-&gt;new($dir, 'foo', -secure);

         my $handle = File::Fu::File::Temp-&gt;new($dir, -noclean);
         # also $handle-&gt;noclean;

       -secure
           Delete the named file (if the OS supports it) immediately after opening.

           Calling <b>name()</b> on this sort of handle throws an error.

       -nocleanup
           Don't attempt to remove the file when the $handle goes out of scope.

   <b>name</b>
         my $file_obj = $handle-&gt;name;

   <b>nocleanup</b>
       Disable autocleanup.

         $handle-&gt;nocleanup;

   <b>write</b>
       Write @content to the tempfile and close it.

         $handle = $handle-&gt;write(@content);

   <b>do</b>
       Execute  subref  with $handle as $_.  If you chain this with the constructor, the destructor cleanup will
       happen immediately after sub has returned.

         my @x = $handle-&gt;do(sub {something($_-&gt;name); ...});

   <b>DESTROY</b>
       Called automatically when the handle goes out of scope.

         $handle-&gt;DESTROY;

   <b>XXX</b>
       Constant representing a chunk of X characters.
