       Tie::Handle - base class definitions for tied handles

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package NewHandle;
           require Tie::Handle;

           @ISA = qw(Tie::Handle);

           sub READ { ... }            # Provide a needed method
           sub TIEHANDLE { ... }       # Overrides inherited method

           package main;

           tie *FH, 'NewHandle';

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides some skeletal methods for handle-tying classes. See perltie for a list of the
       functions required in tying a handle to a package.  The basic <b>Tie::Handle</b> package provides a "new"
       method, as well as methods "TIEHANDLE", "PRINT", "PRINTF" and "GETC".

       For developers wishing to write their own tied-handle classes, the methods are summarized below. The
       perltie section not only documents these, but has sample code as well:

       TIEHANDLE classname, LIST
           The  method  invoked  by  the command "tie *glob, classname". Associates a new glob instance with the
           specified class. "LIST" would represent additional arguments (along  the  lines  of  AnyDBM_File  and
           compatriots) needed to complete the association.

       WRITE this, scalar, length, offset
           Write <u>length</u> bytes of data from <u>scalar</u> starting at <u>offset</u>.

       PRINT this, LIST
           Print the values in <u>LIST</u>

       PRINTF this, format, LIST
           Print the values in <u>LIST</u> using <u>format</u>

       READ this, scalar, length, offset
           Read <u>length</u> bytes of data into <u>scalar</u> starting at <u>offset</u>.

       READLINE this
           Read a single line

       GETC this
           Get a single character

       CLOSE this
           Close the handle

       OPEN this, filename
           (Re-)open the handle

       BINMODE this
           Specify content is binary

       EOF this
           Test for end of file.

       TELL this
           Return position in the file.

       SEEK this, offset, whence
           Position the file.

           Test for end of file.

       DESTROY this
           Free  the storage associated with the tied handle referenced by <u>this</u>.  This is rarely needed, as Perl
           manages its memory quite well. But the option exists, should a class wish to perform specific actions
           upon the destruction of an instance.

</pre><h4><b>MORE</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       The perltie section contains an example of tying handles.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This version of Tie::Handle is neither related to  nor  compatible  with  the  Tie::Handle  (3.0)  module
       available  on CPAN. It was due to an accident that two modules with the same name appeared. The namespace
       clash has been cleared in favor of this module that comes with  the  perl  core  in  September  2000  and
       accordingly the version number has been bumped up to 4.0.
