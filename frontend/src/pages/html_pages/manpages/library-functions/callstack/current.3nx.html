       nx::current - Return information about the method callstack

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>current</b> ?<u>option</u>?

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>current</b> ?<u>option</u>?
              This  introspection  command  provides  information  about various details, to be identified using
              <u>option</u>, on the callstack. The command is invoked from a method body. If <u>option</u>  is  not  provided,
              <b>nx::current</b>  will  default to option <b>object</b> (see below). <b>nx::current</b> operates on the Tcl callstack
              and is aware of NX-specific callstack and stackframe details. Except for the options  <b>callinglevel</b>
              and  <b>level</b>, calling <b>nx::current</b> outside an NX object or method will result in an error. <u>option</u> can
              be any of the following:

              •      <b>activelevel</b> returns the actual callstack level which calls  into  the  currently  executing
                     method  directly.  This  <b>activelevel</b>  might  correspond  the  <b>callinglevel</b>, but this is not
                     necessarily the case. The <b>activelevel</b> also includes intermediate calls,  such  as  <b>nx::next</b>
                     invocations.  The  level is reported as an absolute level number (# followed by a digit) to
                     be directly used as the first argument to <b>uplevel</b> or <b>upvar</b>.

              •      <b>args</b> returns the list of  argument  values  passed  into  the  currently  executing  method
                     implementation.

              •      <b>calledclass</b>  returns the name of the class that provides the method implementation to which
                     the intercepted method call  is  to  be  redirected  (only  available  from  within  filter
                     methods).

              •      <b>calledmethod</b>  returns  the  original method name requested by intercepted method call (only
                     available from within filter methods).

              •      <b>callingclass</b> returns the name of the class which provides the method implementation calling
                     into the currently executing method. See also <b>callingobject</b>.

              •      <b>callinglevel</b> resolves the callstack level of the originating invocation  of  the  currently
                     executing  method implementation. Callstack levels introduced by method interception (e.g.,
                     filters) and by method combination (<b>nx::next</b>) are ignored. The  level  is  reported  as  an
                     absolute  level number (<b>#</b> followed by a digit) to be directly used as the first argument to
                     <b>uplevel</b> or <b>upvar</b>. See also <b>activelevel</b>. If called outside NX, <b>1</b> is returned (which  is  the
                     default for <b>upvar</b> and <b>uplevel</b>).

              •      <b>callingobject</b>  returns the name of the object which is calling into the currently executing
                     method. See also <b>callingclass</b>.

              •      <b>class</b>  returns  the  name  of  the  class  providing   the   currently   executing   method
                     implementation.  The  returned  method-providing class may be different to the class of the
                     current object. If called from within a  method  implementation  provided  by  the  current
                     object itself, an empty string is returned.

              •      <b>filterreg</b> returns the object (class) on which the currently executing method was registered
                     as a filter method (only available from within filter methods).

              •      <b>isnextcall</b>  will return 1, if the currently executing method implementation was invoked via
                     <b>nx::next</b>; 0 otherwise.

              •      <b>level</b> will return a number indicating the stack level of the currently executed  method  or
                     script,  or  an  empty string when executed outside an NX context (e.g., in a Tcl proc or a
                     namespace script). The resulting value can be directly passed as <u>level</u> to <b>info</b> <b>level</b>.

              •      <b>method</b> returns the name of the currently executing method. If an ensemble-method call,  the
                     name of the bottom-most ("leaf") method is returned.

              •      <b>methodpath</b>  returns  the  combined  name  of  the currently executing method (including all
                     ensemble levels) in an ensemble-method call. Otherwise, for  a  regular  method  call,  the
                     result corresponds to the result of option <b>method</b>.

              •      <b>nextmethod</b>  returns  the  name of the next most specific method implementation to be called
                     when invoking <b>nx::next</b>.

              •      <b>object</b> gives the name of the object on which the currently executing method  implementation
                     is evaluated.
