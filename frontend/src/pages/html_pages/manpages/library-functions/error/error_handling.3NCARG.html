</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Error_handling - A set of routines for error handling in NCAR Graphics.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       ENTSR - Enters recovery mode.
       EPRIN - Prints the current error message.
       ERROF - Turns off the internal error flag.
       FDUM - A dump routine - the default version just RETURNS.
       ICFELL - Checks for an outstanding error condition.
       ICLOEM - Computes the real length of its character-string argument (ignoring blanks on the end)
       NERRO - Gets the current value of the internal error flag.
       RETSR - Restores a previous value of the internal error flag.
       SEMESS - Gets a specified portion of the current error message.
       SETER - Called by NCAR Graphics routines to report error conditions.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>SETER</b> <b>IN</b> <b>NCAR</b> <b>GRAPHICS</b></h4><pre>
       There are specific conventions for the use of SETER within NCAR Graphics, as follows:

        -  All detectable errors shall be recoverable, in the sense described above.  (That is, in every call to
           SETER,  the final argument shall be a 1, rather than a 2.) This is by request of the folks doing NCAR
           Interactive, who rightly consider STOPs in the utilities undesirable. The idea is  to  let  the  user
           decide what is to be done about the various error conditions.

        -  Whenever  an  NCAR  Graphics  routine calls a lower-level routine that might detect an error and call
           SETER, it should subsequently use ICFELL to check  the  error  state;  if  a  recoverable  error  has
           occurred, it should first do required clean-up chores, if possible, and then pass control back to the
           routine  that  called  it.  In  all such uses of ICFELL, the first argument should be the name of the
           routine referencing ICFELL and the second argument should be a new number for the  error,  reflecting
           the position of the reference to the lower-level routine in the upper-level routine.

        -  Any NCAR Graphics routine that can be called by a user and that can potentially yield a call to SETER
           must  immediately  check the error state and, if that error state is non-zero, return control without
           doing anything else. This is most conveniently done using a  reference  to  ICFELL;  see  the  second
           example  in the "Usage" section of the description of ICFELL. All such references should have a first
           argument of the form 'XXXXXX - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR', where "XXXXXX" is the name of the  routine  in
           which the reference occurs, and a second argument equal to "1".

        -  It  is recommended that, within a given utility routine, the error numbers in references to SETER and
           ICFELL should start at 1 and increment by 1.  These numbers generally have no  intrinsic  meaning  in
           and  of  themselves:  they  are  merely  intended  to  allow  a consultant to find the reference that
           generated a given error.

        -  NCAR Graphics routines are not required to turn recovery mode on before calling a lower-level routine
           that might call SETER (which was the convention in  the  PORT  library,  as  described  in  the  PORT
           document).   Instead, the assumption is that it is the responsibility of the user of NCAR Graphics to
           set recovery mode if he/she desires to do recovery. Since, by default, recovery mode is  turned  off,
           all  NCAR  Graphics  calls  to  SETER will be treated as fatal: the error message will be printed and
           execution will be terminated. Once the user turns recovery mode on, however, no NCAR  Graphics  error
           will be treated in this way except for one that the user fails to recover from.

       Note:  These  conventions  are being adopted as of December 2, 1993, and represent a goal for the future.
       The current situation is somewhat muddled: In some utilities, all SETER calls are fatal  ones.  In  other
       utilities,  some SETER calls are fatal and some are not. In other utilities, no SETER calls are fatal. In
       general, errors at a lower level are not  detected  and  passed  back  up  the  call  chain.  Users  have
       complained  (and  rightly  so)  that  error  recovery  is,  in general, not possible; observance of these
       conventions should help to fix the situation.

       Further note: As of March 30, 1994, the situation has  improved  markedly.   CONPACK  and  all  utilities
       referenced  by  it have been updated to follow the guidelines given above and work is proceeding on other
       utilities.

       There is one sticky area in which questions remains to be answered: Sometimes, when  an  error  condition
       occurs  during  execution of a utility routine that has changed the internal state of GKS or SPPS, it has
       not been possible to restore the state of those packages to exactly what it was before that  routine  was
       entered.  In  some  cases, better bookkeeping would allow restoration to be done; in other cases, though,
       restoration would involve calling a routine that could generate a call to  SETER,  which  would  cause  a
       STOP.  In  the  latter  cases,  I have not yet worked out a good solution. For the moment, therefore, the
       situation is this: if you call an NCAR Graphics utility with recovery mode turned on and,  when  you  get
       control back, you find that an error has occurred, you must be prepared to deal with the possibility that
       at  least the following things might been changed: 1) the current SET call; 2) the current polyline color
       index; 3) the current polymarker color index; 4) the current text color index; 5) the current  fill  area
       color index; 6) the current dash pattern.
