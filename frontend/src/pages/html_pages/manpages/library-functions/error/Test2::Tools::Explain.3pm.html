</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test2::Tools::Explain -- Explain tools for Perl's Test2 framework

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.02

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Test2::Suite dropped the "explain()" function that had been part of Test::More.  For those who miss it in
       Test2, you can use Test2::Tools::Explain.

           use Test2::Tools::Explain;

           my $errors = fleeble_the_whatzit();
           is( $errors, [], 'Should have no errors from fleebling' ) or diag explain( $errors );

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       All functions in this module are exported by default.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>explain(</b> <b>@things_to_explain</b> <b>)</b>
       Will convert the contents of any references in a human readable format, and return them as strings.
       Usually you want to pass this into "note" or "diag".

       Handy for things like:

           is( $errors, [], 'Should have no errors' ) or diag explain( $errors );

       Note that "explain" does NOT output anything.
