</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Throwable::Error - an easy-to-use class for error objects

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.001

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package MyApp::Error;
         # NOTE: Moo can also be used here instead of Moose
         use Moose;
         extends 'Throwable::Error';

         has execution_phase =&gt; (
           is  =&gt; 'ro',
           isa =&gt; 'MyApp::Phase',
           default =&gt; 'startup',
         );

       ...and in your app...

         MyApp::Error-&gt;throw("all communications offline");

         # or...

         MyApp::Error-&gt;throw({
           message         =&gt; "all communications offline",
           execution_phase =&gt; 'shutdown',
         });

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Throwable::Error is a base class for exceptions that will be thrown to signal errors and abort normal
       program flow.  Throwable::Error is an alternative to Exception::Class, the features of which are largely
       provided by the Moo object system atop which Throwable::Error is built.

       Throwable::Error performs the Throwable and StackTrace::Auto roles.  That means you can call "throw" on
       it to create and throw an error object in one call, and that every error object will have a stack trace
       for its creation.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>message</b>
       This attribute must be defined and must contain a string describing the error condition.  This string
       will be printed at the top of the stack trace when the error is stringified.

   <b>stack_trace</b>
       This attribute, provided by StackTrace::Auto, will contain a stack trace object guaranteed to respond to
       the "as_string" method.  For more information about the stack trace and associated behavior, consult the
       StackTrace::Auto docs.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>as_string</b>
       This method will provide a string representing the error, containing the error's message followed by the
       its stack trace.
