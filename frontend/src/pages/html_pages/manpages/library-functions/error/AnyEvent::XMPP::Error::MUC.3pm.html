       AnyEvent::XMPP::Error::MUC - MUC error

       Subclass of AnyEvent::XMPP::Error

   <b>METHODS</b>
       <b>type</b>
           This method returns either:

           join_timeout
               If the joining of the room took too long.

           no_config_form
               If the room we requested the configuration from didn't provide a data form.

           subject_change_forbidden
               If changing the subject of a room is not allowed.

           message_error
               If this is an unidentified message error.

           If  we  got  a  presence  error the method "presence_error" returns a AnyEvent::XMPP::Error::Presence
           object with further details. However, this class tries to provide a mapping for you  (the  developer)
           to  ease  the  load of figuring out which error means what. To make identification of the errors with
           XEP-0045 more clear I included the error codes and condition names.

           Here are the more descriptive types:

           password_required
               Entering a room Inform user that a password is required.

               (Condition: not-authorized, Code: 401)

           banned
               Entering a room Inform user that he or she is banned from the room

               (Condition: forbidden, Code: 403)

           room_locked
               Entering a room Inform user that the room does not exist and someone is currently creating it.

               (Condition: item-not-found, Code: 404)

           room_not_creatable
               Entering a room Inform user that room creation is restricted

               (Condition: not-allowed, Code: 405)

           use_reserved_nick
               Entering a room Inform user that the reserved roomnick must be used

               (Condition: not-acceptable, Code: 406)

           not_on_memberlist
               Entering a room Inform user that he or she is not on the member list

               (Condition: registration-required, Code: 407)

           nickname_in_use
               Entering a room Inform user that his or her desired room nickname is  in  use  or  registered  by
               another user

               (Condition: conflict, Code: 409)

           room_full
               Entering a room Inform user that the maximum number of users has been reached

               (Condition: service-unavailable, Code: 503)

           The condition and code are also available through the AnyEvent::XMPP::Error::Presence object returned
           by "presence_error", see below.

       <b>text</b>
           This method returns a human readable text if one is available.

           internal error.
