</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Lingua::GA::Gramadoir - Check the grammar of Irish language text

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Lingua::GA::Gramadoir;

         my $gr = new Lingua::GA::Gramadoir;

         my $errors = $gr-&gt;grammatical_errors( $text );
         foreach my $error (@$errors) {
               # process $error appropriately
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module contains the code for segmentation, spell checking, part-of-speech tagging, and grammar
       checking used by "An Gramadóir", an open-source grammar and style checker that can be used with vim,
       emacs, OpenOffice, or through a command-line interface.  An Gramadóir is intended as a platform for the
       development of sophisticated natural language processing tools for languages with limited computational
       resources.

       The Perl code contained in this module is generated automatically from a higher-level representation of
       the grammatical rules and should not be edited directly.  Anyone interested in helping improve the
       lexicon or the rule sets should download the developers' pack from the An Gramadóir web site:
       &lt;<a href="http://borel.slu.edu/gramadoir/">http://borel.slu.edu/gramadoir/</a>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       new %PARAMS
           Constructs  an  instance of the grammar checker and loads the lexicon into memory.  It should only be
           called once.   Options may be specified by passing a hash containing any of the following keys:

           fix_spelling =&gt; 0

           Suggest replacements for misspelled or unknown words.

           use_ignore_file =&gt; 0

           Read a file containing words to be ignored when checking spelling and grammar.

           unigram_tagging =&gt; 1

           Resolve ambiguous part of speech according to frequency.  This  should  be  set  to  false  only  for
           debugging   purposes  because  the  pattern  matching  for  grammatical  errors  relies  on  complete
           disambiguation.

           interface_language =&gt; ""

           Specify the language of output messages (<b>not</b> necessarily the language of the  text  to  be  checked).
           With  the  default value, Locale::Maketext attempts to determine the correct language to use based on
           things like your environment variables.

           input_encoding =&gt; 'ISO-8859-1'

           Specify the encoding for all texts passed to one of the module's exported functions.    There  is  no
           currently  no  way  to  change  the  encoding  of the data returned by the exported functions (always
           encoded as perl strings).

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       get_sentences TEXT
           Splits the input TEXT up into sentences and returns a reference to an array containing the sentences.

       tokenize TEXT
           Splits the input TEXT up into orthographic words and returns a reference to an array  containing  the
           words.

       spell_check TEXT
           Returns a reference to an array containing the misspelled words appearing in the input text.

       all_possible_tags WORD
           Takes  the  input WORD and returns it with (XML-style) markup indicating all of its possible parts of
           speech.

       add_tags TEXT
           Takes  the  input  TEXT  and  returns  a  reference  to  an  array  of  sentences  with   (XML-style)
           *disambiguated* part-of-speech tags.  Does not do any grammatical rule checking.

       xml_stream TEXT
           Takes the input TEXT and returns it as well-formed XML (encoded as perl strings, not utf-8) with full
           grammatical  markup.    Error  messages are not localized.  This function should only be exported for
           debugging/development purposes.  Use "grammatical_errors" (which is basically "xml_stream" plus  some
           whittling down) as an interface with other programs.

       grammatical_errors TEXT
           Returns the grammatical errors in the input TEXT as a reference to an array, one error per element of
           the array, with each error given in a simple XML format usable by other applications.  Error messages
           are localized according to locale settings as determined by Locale::Maketext.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  grammar  checker does not attempt a full parse of the input sentences nor does it attempt to exploit
       any semantic information.  There are, therefore, certain constructs that cannot be dealt with  correctly.
       See &lt;<a href="http://borel.slu.edu/gramadoir/bugs.html">http://borel.slu.edu/gramadoir/bugs.html</a>&gt; for a detailed discussion and specific examples.
