       SETER - Called by NCAR Graphics routines when errors occur.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL SETER(MESSG,NERRF,ILEVL)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_seter(char *messg, int nerrf, int ilevl)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The FORTRAN statement "CALL SETER (MESSG,NERRF,ILEVL) is used to tell the error-handling package that an
       error has occurred. Exactly what happens as a result of such a call depends not only on the values of the
       arguments, but on the settings of two internal variables: the error flag, which says whether or not there
       was a prior error, and the recovery-mode flag, which says whether or not recovery mode is in effect.

        -  If  the  internal error flag is 0 (no prior error) and the internal recovery-mode flag is 2 (recovery
           mode not set, which is the default), SETER prints the error message MESSG, calls FDUM if and only  if
           ILEVL = 2, and then STOPs.

        -  If  the  internal error flag is 0 (no prior error) and the internal recovery-mode flag is 1 (recovery
           mode set), then what happens depends on the value of ILEVL: if ILEVL = 2 (fatal error), SETER  prints
           the  error  message MESSG, calls FDUM, and STOPs, but, if ILEVL = 1 (recoverable error), SETER resets
           the internal error flag equal to NERRF, remembers the error message MESSG, and RETURNs. In the latter
           case, the user is expected to detect the fact that an error has occurred, take the necessary remedial
           action, and call ERROF to turn the internal error flag off.

        -  If the internal error flag is non-zero (prior error), then the value of  the  internal  recovery-mode
           flag  will  be  1 (recovery mode set); in this case, it doesn't make any difference what the value of
           ILEVL is: SETER prints both the remembered error message from the  prior  error  and  the  new  error
           message from MESSG, calls FDUM, and STOPs.

       The arguments of SETER are as follows:

       MESSG       (an  input  variable  or constant of type CHARACTER) is an error message describing the error
                   that has occurred. This should be of the form "XXXXXX - TEXT  DESCRIBING  THE  ERROR",  where
                   "XXXXXX"  is  the  name of the routine in which the error occurred, and it should not be more
                   than 113 characters long.

       NERRF       (an input expression of type INTEGER) is a non-zero error number in the range  from  -999  to
                   +9999.

       ILEVL       (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the "error level" - either a 1 or a 2, implying that
                   the error described by MESSG and NERRF is recoverable or fatal, respectively.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant examples: tseter, arex02.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use  SETER  or c_seter, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.
