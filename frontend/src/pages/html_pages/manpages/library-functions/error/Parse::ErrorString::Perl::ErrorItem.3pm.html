</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Parse::ErrorString::Perl::ErrorItem - a Perl error item object

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Each object contains the following accessors (only "message", "file", and "line" are guaranteed to be
       present for every error):

       type
           Normally  returns  a  single  letter identifying the type of the error. The possbile options are "W",
           "D", "S", "F", "P", "X", and "A".  Sometimes an error can be of either of two types, in which case  a
           string  such  as  ""S|F""  is returned in scalar context and a list of the two letters is returned in
           list context. If "type" is empty, you can assume that the error was not emitted by perl  itself,  but
           by the user or by a third-party module.

       type_description
           A description of the error type. The possible options are:

               W =&gt; warning
               D =&gt; deprecation
               S =&gt; severe warning
               F =&gt; fatal error
               P =&gt; internal error
               X =&gt; very fatal error
               A =&gt; alien error message

           If  the error can be of either or two types, the two types are concactenated with "" or "". Note that
           this description is always returned in English, regardless of the "lang" option.

       message
           The error message.

       file
           The path to the file in which the error occurred, possibly truncated. If  the  error  occurred  in  a
           script,  the  parser will attempt to return only the filename; if the error occurred in a module, the
           parser will attempt to return the path to the module relative to the directory in @INC  in  which  it
           resides.

       file_abspath
           Absolute path to the file in which the error occurred.

       file_msgpath
           The file path as displayed in which the error message.

       line
           Line in which the error occurred.

       near
           Text near which the error occurred (note that this often contains newline characters).

       at  Additional information about where the error occurred (e.g. ""at EOF"").

       diagnostics
           Detailed  explanation  of  the  error  (from  perldiag).  If  the  "lang"  option  is  specified when
           constructing the parser, an attempt will be made to return the diagnostics message in the appropriate
           language. If an explanation is not found in the localized perldiag, the default perldiag will also be
           searched. Returned as raw pod, so you may need to use a pod parser to  render  into  the  format  you
           need.

       stack
           Callstack for the error. Returns a list of Parse::ErrorString::Perl::StackItem objects.
