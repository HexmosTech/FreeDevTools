       natgrid_errors - This document briefly describes all the errors reported from Natgrid.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Each entry below includes the error number and its meaning.

        1     Insufficient data in gridded region to triangulate.

        2     Duplicate input data coordinates are not allowed.

        3     Unable to open file for writing algorithmic data.

        4     WARNING:   The  ratio  of  vertical  to  horizontal  scales  is  too large for meaningful gradient
              estimation.  Rescale the data if gradients are required.

        5     WARNING:  The ratio of vertical  to  horizontal  scales  is  too  small  for  meaningful  gradient
              estimation.  Rescale the data if gradients are required.

        6     WARNING:   The ratio of x-axis breadth to y-axis breadth of this gridded region may be too extreme
              for good interpolation.  Changing the block proportions, or rescaling the x or y coordinate may be
              indicated.  Gradient calculations have been disabled.

        7     Unable to allocate storage for ivector.

        8     Unable to allocate storage for dvector.

        9     Unable to allocate storage for **imatrix.

       10     Unable to allocate storage for imatrix[].

       11     Unable to allocate storage for **fmatrix.

       12     Unable to allocate storage for fmatrix[].

       13     Unable to allocate storage for **dmatrix.

       14     Unable to allocate storage for dmatrix[].

       15     Unable to allocate storage for raw data.

       16     Unable to allocate storage for a simplex.

       17     Unable to allocate storage for temp.

       18     Unable to allocate storage for neig.

       19     slopes have not been computed, set sdip.

       20     row argument out of range.

       21     column argument out of range.

       22     aspects have not been computed, set sdip.

       23     Parameter name not known.

       24     Cannot open error file.

       25     Automatic scaling has been done - aspects will be distorted and  consequently  are  not  returned.
              Rescale your data manually, or by setting magx, magy, and magz appropriately.

       26     Automatic  scaling  has  been  done  - slopes will be distorted and consequently are not returned.
              Rescale your data manually, or by setting magx, magy, and magz appropriately.

       27     Coordinate is outside of the gridded region for a single point interpolation.

       28     Cannot compute aspects and slopes in conjunction with single point interpolation mode.

       29     Fortran DOUBLE PRECISION entries are not supported on UNICOS.

       30     Error number out of range.
