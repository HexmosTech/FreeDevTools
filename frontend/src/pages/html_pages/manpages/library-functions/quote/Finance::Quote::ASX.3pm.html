</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Finance::Quote::ASX - Obtain quotes from the Australian Stock Exchange.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Finance::Quote;
               $q = Finance::Quote-&gt;new;
               %stockinfo = $q-&gt;fetch("asx","BHP");       # Only query ASX.
               %stockinfo = $q-&gt;fetch("australia","BHP"); # Failover to other sources OK.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module obtains information from the Australian Stock Exchange <a href="http://www.asx.com.au/">http://www.asx.com.au/</a>.  Data for all
       Australian listed securities and indices is available.  Indexes start with the letter 'X'.  For example,
       the All Ordinaries is "XAO".  But some securities also start with the letter 'X'.

       This module is loaded by default on a Finance::Quote object.  It's also possible to load it explicitly by
       placing "ASX" in the argument list to Finance::Quote-&gt;<b>new()</b>.

       This module provides both the "asx" and "australia" fetch methods.  Please use the "australia" fetch
       method if you wish to have failover with other sources for Australian stocks (such as Yahoo).  Using the
       "asx" method will guarantee that your information only comes from the Australian Stock Exchange.

       Information returned by this module is governed by the Australian Stock Exchange's terms and conditions.

</pre><h4><b>LABELS</b> <b>RETURNED</b></h4><pre>
       The following labels may be returned by Finance::Quote::ASX: bid, offer, open, high, low, last, net,
       p_change, volume, and price.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Australian Stock Exchange, <a href="http://www.asx.com.au/">http://www.asx.com.au/</a>
