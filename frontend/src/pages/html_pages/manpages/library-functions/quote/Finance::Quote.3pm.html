</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Finance::Quote - Get stock and mutual fund quotes from various exchanges

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use Finance::Quote;

          $q = Finance::Quote-&gt;new;
          %quotes  = $q-&gt;fetch("nasdaq", @stocks);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module gets stock quotes from various internet sources all over the world.  Quotes are obtained by
       constructing a quoter object and using the fetch method to gather data, which is returned as a two-
       dimensional hash (or a reference to such a hash, if called in a scalar context).  For example:

           $q = Finance::Quote-&gt;new;
           %info = $q-&gt;fetch("australia", "CML");
           print "The price of CML is ".$info{"CML", "price"};

       The first part of the hash (eg, "CML") is referred to as the stock.  The second part (in this case,
       "price") is referred to as the label.

   <b>LABELS</b>
       When information about a stock is returned, the following standard labels may be used.  Some custom-
       written modules may use labels not mentioned here.  If you wish to be certain that you obtain a certain
       set of labels for a given stock, you can specify that using <b>require_labels()</b>.

</pre><h4><b>PUBLIC</b> <b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Finance::Quote  implements  public  class  methods  for  constructing a quoter object, getting or setting
       default class values, and for listing available methods.

   <b>new</b>
           my $q = Finance::Quote-&gt;new()
           my $q = Finance::Quote-&gt;new('-defaults')
           my $q = Finance::Quote-&gt;new(timeout =&gt; 30)
           my $q = Finance::Quote-&gt;new('YahooJSON', fetch_currency =&gt; 'EUR')
           my $q = Finance::Quote-&gt;new('alphavantage' =&gt; {API_KEY =&gt; '...'})
           my $q = Finance::Quote-&gt;new(currency_rates =&gt; {order =&gt; ['ECB', 'Fixer'], 'fixer' =&gt; {API_KEY =&gt; '...'}});

       Finance::Quote modules access a wide range of sources to provide quotes.  A module provides one  or  more
       methods  to  fetch  quotes. One method is usually the name of the module in lower case. Other methods, if
       provided, are descriptive names, such as 'canada', 'nasdaq', or 'nyse'.

       A Finance::Quote object uses one or more methods to fetch quotes for securities.

       "new" constructs a Finance::Quote object and enables the  caller  to  load  only  specific  modules,  set
       parameters that control the behavior of the fetch method, and pass method specific parameters.

       "timeout =" T&gt; sets the web request timeout to "T" seconds
       "failover =" B&gt; where "B" is a boolean value indicating if failover in fetch is permitted
       "fetch_currency =" C&gt; sets the desired currency code to "C" for fetch results
       "currency_rates =" H&gt; configures the order currency rate modules are consulted for exchange rates and
       currency rate module options
       "required_labels =" A&gt; sets the required labels for fetch results to array "A"
       "&lt;ModuleName"&gt; as a string is the name of a specific Finance::Quote::Module to load
       "&lt;methodname" =&gt; H&gt; passes hash "H" to methodname during fetch to configure the method

       With  no  arguments,  "new" creates a Finance::Quote object with the default methods.  If the environment
       variable FQ_LOAD_QUOTELET is set, then the contents of FQ_LOAD_QUOTELET (split  on  whitespace)  will  be
       used  as  the argument list.  This allows users to load their own custom modules without having to change
       existing code. If any method names are passed to "new"  or  the  flag  '-defaults'  is  included  in  the
       argument list, then FQ_LOAD_QUOTELET is ignored.

       When  <b>new()</b>  is  passed  one  or  more class name arguments, an object is created with only the specified
       modules loaded.  If the first argument is '-defaults', then the default modules  will  be  loaded  first,
       followed  by  any other specified modules. Note that the FQ_LOAD_QUOTELET environment variable must begin
       with '-defaults' if you wish the default modules to be loaded.

       Method  names  correspond  to  the  Perl  module  in  the  Finance::Quote  module  space.   For  example,
       "Finance::Quote-"new('ASX')&gt; will load the module Finance::Quote::ASX, which provides the method "asx".

       Some  methods  require  API  keys  or  have unique options. Passing 'method =&gt; HASH' to <b>new()</b> enables the
       caller to provide a configuration HASH to the corresponding method.

       The key 'currency_rates' configures  the  Finanace::Quote  currency  rate  conversion.   By  default,  to
       maintain   backward  compatibility,  Finance::Quote::CurrencyRates::AlphaVantage  is  used  for  currency
       conversion.  This end point requires an API key, which can either be set in the environment  or  included
       in  the  configuration  hash.  To  specify  a  different  primary currency conversion method or configure
       fallback methods, include the 'order' key, which points  to  an  array  of  Finance::Quote::CurrencyRates
       module  names.   Setting  the  environment variable FQ_CURRENCY will change the default endpoint used for
       currency conversion.  See the documentation for the individual Finance::Quote::CurrencyRates  modules  to
       learn more.

   <b>get_default_currency_fields</b>
           my @fields = Finance::Quote::get_default_currency_fields();

       "get_default_currency_fields"  returns  the  standard  list  of  fields in a quote that are automatically
       converted during currency conversion. Individual modules may override this list.

   <b>get_default_timeout</b>
           my $value = Finance::Quote::get_default_timeout();

       "get_default_timeout" returns the current Finance::Quote default timeout in  seconds  for  web  requests.
       Finance::Quote  does  not  specify  a  default  timeout,  deferring  to the underlying user agent for web
       requests. So this function will return undef unless "set_default_timeout" was previously called.

   <b>set_default_timeout</b>
           Finance::Quote::<a href="../man45/set_default_timeout.45.html">set_default_timeout</a>(45);

       "set_default_timeout" sets the Finance::Quote default timeout to a new value.

   <b>get_methods</b>
           my @methods = Finance::Quote::get_methods();

       "get_methods" returns the list of methods that can be passed to "new" when creating a quoter  object  and
       as the first argument to "fetch".

   <b>get_features</b>
           my %features = Finance::Quote::get_features();

       "get_features" returns a hash with three keys: quote_methods, quote_modules, and currency_modules.

           $features{quote_methods} is a hash with key/value pairs of method_name =&gt; [array of module names]
           $features{quote_modules} is a hash with key/value pairs of module_name =&gt; [array of parameter names]
           $features{currency_modules} is a hash with key/value pairs of currency_module_name =&gt; [array of paramater names]

       Parameter  names are values that the module needs to function, such as API_KEY. Most modules will have an
       empty list.  Modules with a parameter are configured when creating  the  Finance::Quote  by  passing  the
       argument

          'module_name_in_lower_case' =&gt; {paramter =&gt; value}

       to Finance::Quote-&gt;<b>new()</b>.

       The  keys  of the $features{currency_modules} hash are the names of currency modules that can be used for
       currency conversion and the order in which the modules are used is controlled by the argument

           currency_rates =&gt; {order =&gt; [subset of $features{currency_modules}]}

       to Finance::Quote-&gt;<b>new()</b>.  By default, AlphaVantage in used for currency conversion, "order" can  be  set
       to  use  other currency modules.  The currency module used can also be changed by setting the FQ_CURRENCY
       environment variable. Please note that some of the alternate currency modules require API keys.

</pre><h4><b>PUBLIC</b> <b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>B_to_billions</b>
           my $value = $q-&gt;B_to_billions("20B");

       "B_to_billions" is a  utility  function  that  expands  a  numeric  string  with  a  "B"  suffix  to  the
       corresponding multiple of 1000000000.

   <b>decimal_shiftup</b>
           my $value = $q-&gt;decimal_shiftup("123.45", 1);  # returns 1234.5
           my $value = $q-&gt;decimal_shiftup("0.25", 1);    # returns 2.5

       "decimal_shiftup"  moves  a  the  decimal point in a numeric string the specified number of places to the
       right.

   <b>fetch</b>
           my %stocks  = $q-&gt;fetch("alphavantage", "IBM", "MSFT", "LNUX");
           my $hashref = $q-&gt;fetch("nasdaq", "IBM", "MSFT", "LNUX");

       "fetch" takes a method as its first argument and the remaining arguments are treated as  securities.   If
       the quoter $q was constructed with a specific method or methods, then only those methods are available.

       When  called in an array context, a hash is returned.  In a scalar context, a reference to a hash will be
       returned. The  keys  for  the  returned  hash  are  "{SECURITY,LABEL}".   For  the  above  example  call,
       $stocks{"IBM","high"} is the high value for IBM.

       $q-&gt;<b>get_methods()</b> returns the list of valid methods for quoter object $q. Some methods specify a specific
       Finance::Quote  module,  such as 'alphavantage'. Other methods are available from multiple Finance::Quote
       modules, such as 'nasdaq'.  The quoter failover over option determines if multiple modules are  consulted
       for methods such as 'nasdaq' that more than one implementation.

   <b>get_failover</b>
           my $failover = $q-&gt;get_failover();

       Failover  is when the "fetch" method attempts to retrieve quote information for a security from alternate
       sources when the requested method fails.  "get_failover" returns a boolean value indicating if the quoter
       object will use failover or not.

   <b>set_failover</b>
           $q-&gt;set_failover(False);

       "set_failover" sets the failover flag on the quoter object.

   <b>get_fetch_currency</b>
           my $currency = $q-&gt;get_fetch_currency();

       "get_fetch_currency" returns either the desired currency code for the quoter object or undef if no target
       currency was set during construction or with the "set_fetch_currency" function.

   <b>set_fetch_currency</b>
           $q-&gt;set_fetch_currency("FRF");  # Get results in French Francs.

       "set_fetch_currency" method is used to  request  that  all  information  be  returned  in  the  specified
       currency.   Note  that this increases the chance stock-lookup failure, as remote requests must be made to
       fetch both the stock information and the currency rates.  In  order  to  improve  reliability  and  speed
       performance,  currency  conversion rates are cached and are assumed not to change for the duration of the
       Finance::Quote object.

       See the introduction to this page for information on how to configure the source of  currency  conversion
       rates.

   <b>get_required_labels</b>
           my @labels = $q-&gt;get_required_labels();

       "get_required_labels"  returns  the  list  of  labels  that  must be populated for a security quote to be
       considered valid and returned by "fetch".

   <b>set_required_labels</b>
           my $labels = ['close', 'isodate', 'last'];
           $q-&gt;set_required_labels($labels);

       "set_required_labels" updates the list of required labels for the quoter object.

   <b>get_timeout</b>
           my $timeout = $q-&gt;get_timeout();

       "get_timeout" returns the timeout in seconds the quoter object is using for web requests.

   <b>set_timeout</b>
           $q-&gt;<a href="../man45/set_timeout.45.html">set_timeout</a>(45);

       "set_timeout" updated the timeout in seconds for the quoter object.

   <b>store_date</b>
           $quoter-&gt;store_date(\%info, $stocks, {eurodate =&gt; '06/11/2020'});

       "store_date" is used by modules to consistent store date information about securities. Given the  various
       pieces  of  a  date,  this  function  figures  out  how  to construct a ISO date (yyyy-mm-dd) and US date
       (mm/dd/yyyy) and stores those values in %info for security $stock.

   <b>get_user_agent</b>
           my $ua = $q-&gt;get_user_agent();

       "get_user_agent" returns the LWP::UserAgent the quoter object is using for web requests.

   <b>isoTime</b>
           $q-&gt;isoTime("11:39PM");    # returns "23:39"
           $q-&gt;isoTime("9:10 AM");    # returns "09:10"

       "isoTime" returns an ISO formatted time.

</pre><h4><b>PUBLIC</b> <b>CLASS</b> <b>OR</b> <b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods are available as class methods, but can also be called from Finance::Quote objects.

   <b>scale_field</b>
           my $value = Finance::Quote-&gt;scale_field('1023', '0.01')

       "scale_field" is a utility function that scales the first argument by the second argument.  In the  above
       example, "value" is '10.23'.

   <b>currency</b>
           my $value = $q-&gt;currency('15.95 USD', 'AUD');
           my $value = Finance::Quote-&gt;currency('23.45 EUR', 'RUB');

       "currency"  converts  a  value with a currency code suffix to another currency using the current exchange
       rate as determined by the Finance::Quote::CurrencyRates method or methods configured for the  quoter  $q.
       When  called  as  a class method, Finance::Quote::AlphaVantage is the default, which requires an API key.
       See  the  introduction   for   information   on   configuring   currency   rate   conversions   and   see
       Finance::Quote::CurrencyRates::AlphaVantage for information about the API key.

   <b>currency_lookup</b>
           my $currency = $quoter-&gt;currency_lookup();
           my $currency = $quoter-&gt;currency_lookup( name =&gt; "Caribbean");
           my $currency = $quoter-&gt;currency_loopup( country =&gt; qw/denmark/i );
           my $currency = $q-&gt;currency_lookup(country =&gt; qr/united states/i, number =&gt; 840);

       "currency_lookup"  takes  zero  or  more  constraints  and  filters  the  list  of  currencies  known  to
       Finance::Quote. It returns a hash reference where the keys are ISO currency codes and the values are hash
       references containing metadata about the currency.

       A constraint is a key name and either   a  scalar  or  regular  expression.   A  currency  satisfies  the
       constraint  if its metadata hash contains the constraint key and the value of that metadata field matches
       the regular expression or contains the constraint value as a substring.  If  the  metadata  field  is  an
       array, then it satisfies the constraint if any value in the array satisfies the constraint.

   <b>parse_csv</b>
           my @list = Finance::Quote::parse_csv($string);

       "parse_csv"  is  a  utility  function  for splitting a comma separated value string into a list of terms,
       treating double-quoted strings that contain commas as a single value.

   <b>parse_csv_semicolon</b>
           my @list = Finance::Quote::parse_csv_semicolon($string);

       "parse_csv" is a utility function for splitting a semicolon separated value string into a list of  terms,
       treating double-quoted strings that contain semicolons as a single value.

</pre><h4><b>LEGACY</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>default_currency_fields</b>
       Replaced with <b>get_default_currency_fields()</b>.

   <b>sources</b>
       Replaced with <b>get_methods()</b>.

   <b>failover</b>
       Replaced with <b>get_failover()</b> and <b>set_failover()</b>.

   <b>require_labels</b>
       Replaced with <b>get_required_labels()</b> and <b>set_required_labels()</b>.

   <b>user_agent</b>
       Replaced with <b>get_user_agent()</b>.

   <b>set_currency</b>
       Replaced with <b>get_fetch_currency()</b> and <b>set_fetch_currency()</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Finance::Quote  respects  all  environment  that your installed version of LWP::UserAgent respects.  Most
       importantly, it respects the http_proxy environment variable.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b> <b>COUNTER</b></h4><pre>
       A simple usage counter has been enabled. Other than the user's IP address,  Finance::Quote  version,  and
       which  method  was  used,  no  other  data  is collected. To opt out of your usage being counted, set the
       environment variable "FQ_NOCOUNT".

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The caller cannot control the fetch failover order.

       The two-dimensional hash is a somewhat unwieldly method of passing around information  when  compared  to
       references

</pre><h4><b>DONATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       While the contributors to Finance::Quote are happy to volunteer their time and resources on this project,
       donations  are  helpful  and  great way to say thank you. So far the only real cost to the team is domain
       registration for finance-quote.org. However, some operating systems and hardware upgrades do have a cost.
       Access to the latest or current environments is needed for  development  and  testing.  Upgrades  to  the
       latest  MS  Windows  often  includes a cost, and recently Apple's move to ARM/M1/M2 CPUs has stifled some
       contributors' ability to assist. With that  in  mind,  you  can  send  donations  to  the  email  address
       <a href="mailto:donations@finance-quote.org">donations@finance-quote.org</a>  through  PayPal.  If it's for a particular contributor, please indicate in a
       note while submitting the donation through PayPal.

       Additionally, Bitcoin donations can be received at 37Bg4EMAp575j4iL9jHv1ZhDgiropU38jY.
