</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTML::Strip - Perl extension for stripping HTML markup from text.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use HTML::Strip;

         my $hs = HTML::Strip-&gt;new();

         my $clean_text = $hs-&gt;parse( $raw_html );
         $hs-&gt;eof;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module simply strips HTML-like markup from text rapidly and brutally.  It could easily be used to
       strip XML or SGML markup instead - but as removing HTML is a much more common problem, this module lives
       in the HTML:: namespace.

       It is written in XS, and thus about five times quicker than using regular expressions for the same task.

       It does <u>not</u> do any syntax checking.  If you want that, use HTML::Parser.  Instead it merely applies the
       following rules:

       1.  Anything  that  looks  like  a  tag, or group of tags will be replaced with a single space character.
           Tags are considered to be anything that starts with a "&lt;" and ends with a "&gt;"; with the caveat that a
           "&gt;" character may appear in either of the following without ending the tag:

           Quote
               Quotes are considered to start with either a "'" or a """ character,  and  end  with  a  matching
               character  <u>not</u>  preceded  by an even number or escaping slashes (i.e. "\"" does not end the quote
               but "\\\\"" does).

           Comment
               If the tag starts with an exclamation mark, it is assumed to  be  a  declaration  or  a  comment.
               Within  such tags, "&gt;" characters do not end the tag if they appear within pairs of double dashes
               (e.g. "&lt;!-- &lt;a href="old.htm"&gt;old page&lt;/a&gt; --&gt;" would be stripped completely).   No  parsing  for
               quotes is performed within comments, so for instance "&lt;!-- comment with both ' quote types " --&gt;"
               would be entirely stripped.

       2.  Anything  that  appears between tags which we term <u>strip</u> <u>tags</u> is removed.  By default, these tags are
           "title", "script", "style" and "applet".

       HTML::Strip maintains state between calls, so you can parse a document in chunks should you wish.   If  a
       call to parse() ends half-way through a tag, quote or comment; the next call to parse() expects its input
       to carry on from that point.

       If  this  is  not  the  behaviour  you  want,  you can either call eof() between calls to parse(), or set
       "auto_reset" to true (either on the constructor or with "set_auto_reset") so that the parser  will  reset
       after each call.

   <b>METHODS</b>
       <b>new()</b>
           Constructor.   Can  optionally take a hash of settings (with keys corresponding to the "set_" methods
           below).

           Example:

            my $hs = HTML::Strip-&gt;new(
                striptags   =&gt; [ 'script', 'iframe' ],
                emit_spaces =&gt; 0
            );

       <b>parse()</b>
           Takes a string as an argument, returns it stripped of HTML.

       <b>eof()</b>
           Resets the current state information, ready to parse a new block of HTML.

       <b>clear_striptags()</b>
           Clears the current set of strip tags.

       <b>add_striptag()</b>
           Adds the string passed as an argument to the current set of strip tags.

       <b>set_striptags()</b>
           Takes a reference to an array of strings, which replace the current set of strip tags.

       <b>set_emit_spaces()</b>
           Takes a boolean value.  If set to false, HTML::Strip will not attempt any  conversion  of  tags  into
           spaces.  Set to true by default.

       <b>set_emit_newlines()</b>
           Takes a boolean value.  If set to true, HTML::Strip will output newlines after "&lt;br&gt;" and "&lt;p&gt;" tags.
           Set to false by default.

       <b>set_decode_entities()</b>
           Takes  a  boolean value.  If set to false, HTML::Strip will not decode HTML entities.  Set to true by
           default.

       <b>filter_entities()</b>
           If    HTML::Entities    is    available,    this    method     behaves     just     like     invoking
           HTML::Entities::decode_entities, except that it respects the current setting of 'decode_entities'.

       <b>set_filter()</b>
           Sets  a  filter  to  be  applied  after tags were stripped.  It may accept the name of a method (like
           'filter_entities') or a code ref.  By default, its value is 'filter_entities'  if  HTML::Entities  is
           available or "undef" otherwise.

       <b>set_auto_reset()</b>
           Takes a boolean value.  If set to true, "parse" resets after each call (equivalent to calling "eof").
           Otherwise,  the  parser remembers its state from one call to "parse" to another, until you call "eof"
           explicitly.  Set to false by default.

       <b>set_debug()</b>
           Outputs extensive debugging information on internal state during the parse.  Not intended to be  used
           by anyone except the module maintainer.

       <b>decode_entities()</b>
       <b>filter()</b>
       <b>auto_reset()</b>
       <b>debug()</b>
           Readonly accessors for their respective settings.

   <b>LIMITATIONS</b>
       Whitespace
           Despite  only  outputting  one space character per group of tags, and avoiding doing so when tags are
           bordered by spaces or the start or end of strings, HTML::Strip can often output  more  than  desired;
           such as with the following HTML:

            &lt;h1&gt; HTML::Strip &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt; &lt;strong&gt; fast, and brutal &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

           Which gives the following output:

           " HTML::Strip    fast, and brutal   "

           Thus, you may want to post-filter the output of HTML::Strip to remove excess whitespace (for example,
           using "tr/ / /s;").  (This has been improved since previous releases, but is still an issue)

       HTML Entities
           HTML::Strip will only attempt decoding of HTML entities if HTML::Entities is installed.

   <b>EXPORT</b>
       None by default.
