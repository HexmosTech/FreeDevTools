       erl_recomment - Inserting comments into abstract Erlang syntax trees.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Inserting comments into abstract Erlang syntax trees

       This  module  contains  functions for inserting comments, described by position, indentation and text, as
       attachments on an abstract syntax tree, at the correct places.

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
         <b>syntaxTree()</b> <b>=</b> <b>erl_syntax:syntaxTree():</b>

           An abstract syntax tree. See the erl_syntax module for details.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>quick_recomment_forms(Tree::erl_syntax:forms(),</b>           <b>Cs::[erl_comment_scan:comment()])</b>            <b>-&gt;</b>
       <b>erl_syntax:syntaxTree()</b>

              Like  recomment_forms/2, but only inserts top-level comments. Comments within function definitions
              or declarations ("forms") are simply ignored.

       <b>recomment_forms(Tree::erl_syntax:forms(),</b> <b>Cs::[erl_comment_scan:comment()])</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>erl_syntax:syntaxTree()</b>

              Attaches comments to the syntax tree/trees representing a program. The given  <u>Forms</u>  should  be  a
              single  syntax tree of type <u>form_list</u>, or a list of syntax trees representing "program forms". The
              syntax trees must contain valid position information  (for  details,  see  <u>recomment_tree/2</u>).  The
              result is a corresponding syntax tree of type <u>form_list</u> in which all comments in the list <u>Comments</u>
              have been attached at the proper places.

              Assuming <u>Forms</u> represents a program (or any sequence of "program forms"), any comments whose first
              lines  are  not  directly  associated with a specific program form will become standalone comments
              inserted between the neighbouring program forms. Furthermore, comments whose  column  position  is
              less than or equal to one will not be attached to a program form that begins at a conflicting line
              number (this can happen with preprocessor-generated <u>line</u>-attributes).

              If  <u>Forms</u>  is  a  syntax  tree  of  some  other type than <u>form_list</u>, the comments will be inserted
              directly using <u>recomment_tree/2</u>, and any comments  left  over  from  that  process  are  added  as
              postcomments on the result.

              Entries  in  <u>Comments</u>  represent  multi-line comments. For each entry, <u>Line</u> is the line number and
              <u>Column</u> the left column of the comment (the column of the first comment-introducing "<u>%</u>" character).
              <u>Indentation</u> is the number of character positions between the last non-whitespace character  before
              the  comment  (or  the  left margin) and the left column of the comment. <u>Text</u> is a list of strings
              representing the consecutive comment lines in top-down  order,  where  each  string  contains  all
              characters following (but not including) the comment-introducing "<u>%</u>" and up to (but not including)
              the terminating newline. (Cf. module <u>erl_comment_scan</u>.)

              Evaluation  exits  with  reason  <u>{bad_position,</u> <u>Pos}</u> if the associated position information <u>Pos</u> of
              some subtree in the input does not have a recognizable format, or with reason <u>{bad_tree,</u> <u>L,</u> <u>C}</u>  if
              insertion of a comment at line <u>L</u>, column <u>C</u>, fails because the tree structure is ill-formed.

              <u>See</u> <u>also:</u> erl_comment_scan, quick_recomment_forms/2, recomment_tree/2.

       <b>recomment_tree(Tree::erl_syntax:syntaxTree(),</b>             <b>Cs::[erl_comment_scan:comment()])</b>            <b>-&gt;</b>
       <b>{erl_syntax:syntaxTree(),</b> <b>[erl_comment_scan:comment()]}</b>

              Attaches comments to a syntax tree. The result is a pair <u>{NewTree,</u> <u>Remainder}</u> where <u>NewTree</u> is the
              given <u>Tree</u> where comments from the  list  <u>Comments</u>  have  been  attached  at  the  proper  places.
              <u>Remainder</u>  is  the  list  of  entries in <u>Comments</u> which have not been inserted, because their line
              numbers are greater than those of any node in the tree. The entries in <u>Comments</u>  are  inserted  in
              order; if two comments become attached to the same node, they will appear in the same order in the
              program text.

              The nodes of the syntax tree must contain valid position information. This can be single integers,
              assumed  to  represent  a  line  number, or 2- or 3-tuples where the first or second element is an
              integer, in which case the leftmost integer element is assumed to represent the line number.  Line
              numbers  less  than  one  are ignored (usually, the default line number for newly created nodes is
              zero).

              For details on the <u>Line</u>, <u>Column</u> and <u>Indentation</u> fields, and the behaviour in case of  errors,  see
              <u>recomment_forms/2</u>.

              <u>See</u> <u>also:</u> recomment_forms/2.
