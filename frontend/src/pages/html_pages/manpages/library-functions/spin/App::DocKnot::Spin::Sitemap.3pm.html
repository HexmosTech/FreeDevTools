</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::DocKnot::Spin::Sitemap - Generate page navigation links for spin

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use App::DocKnot::Spin::Sitemap;
           my $sitemap = App::DocKnot::Spin::Sitemap-&gt;new('/path/to/.sitemap');
           my @links = $sitemap-&gt;links('some/output/page.html');
           my @navbar = $sitemap-&gt;navbar('some/output/page.html');

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.24 or later and the List::SomeUtils and Path::Tiny modules, both of which are available from CPAN.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       App::DocKnot::Spin supports sitemap information stored in a ".sitemap" file at the top of the source
       directory.  If this is present, it is used to add navigation information to every generated page.

       App::DocKnot::Spin::Sitemap encapsulates parsing of that file and generating the HTML for inter-page
       links.  It can also generate HTML for the entirety of the sitemap to support the "\sitemap" thread
       command.

       The format of this file is one line per web page, with indentation showing the tree structure.  Each line
       should be formatted as a partial URL (relative to the top of the site) starting with "/", a colon, and a
       page description.  The partial URL should be for the generated pages, not the source files (so, for
       example, should use an ".html" extension).  The top of the generated site should have the URL of "/" at
       the top of the sitemap.

       If two pages at the same level aren't related and shouldn't have next and previous links to each other,
       they should be separated by three dashes on a line by themselves at the same indentation level.

       Here's an example of a simple <u>.sitemap</u> file:

           /personal/: Personal Information
             /personal/contact.html: Contact Information
             ---
             /personal/projects.html: Current Projects
           /links/: Links
             /links/lit.html: Other Literature
             /links/music.html: Music
             /links/sf.html: Science Fiction and Fantasy

       This defines two sub-pages of the top page, "/personal/" and "/links/".  "/personal/" has two pages under
       it that are not part of the same set and therefore shouldn't have links to each other.  "/links/" has
       three pages under it which are part of a set and should be linked between each other.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new(PATH)
           Create a new App::DocKnot::Spin::Sitemap object for the <u>.sitemap</u> file specified by PATH.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       links(PAGE)
           Generate  the  "&lt;link&gt;"  tags for the provided PAGE, which should be a URL relative to the top of the
           generated site and starting with "/".  The return value is a  list  of  lines  to  add  to  the  HTML
           "&lt;head&gt;" section, or an empty list if the page was not found in the sitemap.

       navbar(PAGE)
           Generate  the  navigation bar for the provided PAGE, which should be a URL relative to the top of the
           generated site and starting with "/".  The return  value  is  a  list  of  HTML  lines  suitable  for
           injecting into the output page.

       <b>sitemap()</b>
           Return  the  sitemap  as a list of lines of formatted HTML, suitable for inclusion in a generated web
           page.  This is used to implement the "\sitemap" thread command.
