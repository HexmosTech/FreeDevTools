       URI::Escape - Percent-encode and percent-decode unsafe characters

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use URI::Escape;
        $safe = uri_escape("10% is enough\n");
        $verysafe = uri_escape("foo", "\0-\377");
        $str  = uri_unescape($safe);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides functions to percent-encode and percent-decode URI strings as defined by RFC 3986.
       Percent-encoding URI's is informally called "URI escaping".  This is the terminology used by this module,
       which predates the formalization of the terms by the RFC by several years.

       A URI consists of a restricted set of characters.  The restricted set of characters consists of digits,
       letters, and a few graphic symbols chosen from those common to most of the character encodings and input
       facilities available to Internet users.  They are made up of the "unreserved" and "reserved" character
       sets as defined in RFC 3986.

          unreserved    = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
          reserved      = ":" / "/" / "?" / "#" / "[" / "]" / "@"
                          "!" / "$" / "&amp;" / "'" / "(" / ")"
                        / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="

       In addition, any byte (octet) can be represented in a URI by an escape sequence: a triplet consisting of
       the character "%" followed by two hexadecimal digits.  A byte can also be represented directly by a
       character, using the US-ASCII character for that octet.

       Some of the characters are <u>reserved</u> for use as delimiters or as part of certain URI components.  These
       must be escaped if they are to be treated as ordinary data.  Read RFC 3986 for further details.

       The functions provided (and exported by default) from this module are:

       uri_escape( $string )
       uri_escape( $string, $unsafe )
           Replaces  each unsafe character in the $string with the corresponding escape sequence and returns the
           result.  The $string argument should be a string of bytes.  The <b>uri_escape()</b> function will  croak  if
           given a characters with code above 255.  Use <b>uri_escape_utf8()</b> if you know you have such chars or/and
           want chars in the 128 .. 255 range treated as UTF-8.

           The <b>uri_escape()</b> function takes an optional second argument that overrides the set of characters that
           are  to  be  escaped.   The  set  is  specified  as a string that can be used in a regular expression
           character class (between [ ]).  E.g.:

             "\x00-\x1f\x7f-\xff"          # all control and hi-bit characters
             "a-z"                         # all lower case characters
             "^A-Za-z"                     # everything not a letter

           The default set of characters to be escaped is all those which  are  <u>not</u>  part  of  the  "unreserved"
           character class shown above as well as the reserved characters.  I.e. the default is:

               "^A-Za-z0-9\-\._~"

           The second argument can also be specified as a regular expression object:

             qr/[^A-Za-z]/

           Any strings matched by this regular expression will have all of their characters escaped.

       uri_escape_utf8( $string )
       uri_escape_utf8( $string, $unsafe )
           Works  like  <b>uri_escape()</b>,  but  will  encode  chars  as UTF-8 before escaping them.  This makes this
           function able to deal with characters with code above 255 in $string.  Note that chars in the 128  ..
           255  range  will  be  escaped  differently by this function compared to what <b>uri_escape()</b> would.  For
           chars in the 0 .. 127 range there is no difference.

           Equivalent to:

               utf8::encode($string);
               my $uri = uri_escape($string);

           Note: JavaScript has a function called <b>escape()</b> that produces the sequence "%uXXXX" for chars in  the
           256  ..  65535  range.   This  function has really nothing to do with URI escaping but some folks got
           confused since it "does the right thing" in the 0 .. 255 range.  Because of this  you  sometimes  see
           "URIs"  with  these  kind  of  escapes.   The  JavaScript <b>encodeURIComponent()</b> function is similar to
           <b>uri_escape_utf8()</b>.

       uri_unescape($string,...)
           Returns a string with each %XX sequence replaced with the actual byte (octet).

           This does the same as:

              $string =~ s/%([0-9A-Fa-f]{2})/chr(hex($1))/eg;

           but does not modify the string in-place as this RE would.  Using the <b>uri_unescape()</b> function  instead
           of the RE might make the code look cleaner and is a few characters less to type.

           In  a  simple  benchmark  test  I did, calling the function (instead of the inline RE above) if a few
           chars were unescaped was something like 40% slower, and something like 700% slower if none were.   If
           you are going to unescape a lot of times it might be a good idea to inline the RE.

           If the <b>uri_unescape()</b> function is passed multiple strings, then each one is returned unescaped.

       The  module  can  also  export  the  %escapes  hash, which contains the mapping from all 256 bytes to the
       corresponding  escape  codes.   Lookup  in  this  hash  is  faster  than  evaluating   "sprintf("%%%02X",
       ord($byte))" each time.
