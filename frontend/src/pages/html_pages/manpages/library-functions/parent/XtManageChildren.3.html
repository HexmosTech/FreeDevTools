</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>XtManageChildren</b> function performs the following:

       •    Issues  an  error if the children do not all have the same parent or if the parent is not a subclass
            of <b>compositeWidgetClass</b>.

       •    Returns immediately if the common parent is being destroyed; otherwise, for each unique child on the
            list, <b>XtManageChildren</b> ignores the child if it already is managed or is being destroyed and marks it
            if not.

       •    If the parent is realized and after all children have been  marked,  it  makes  some  of  the  newly
            managed children viewable:

            -    Calls the change_managed routine of the widgets' parent.

            -    Calls <b>XtRealizeWidget</b> on each previously unmanaged child that is unrealized.

            -    Maps each previously unmanaged child that has map_when_managed <b>True</b>.

       Managing  children  is  independent  of the ordering of children and independent of creating and deleting
       children.  The layout routine of the parent should consider children whose  managed  field  is  <b>True</b>  and
       should  ignore  all  other  children.   Note  that  some  composite widgets, especially fixed boxes, call
       <b>XtManageChild</b> from their insert_child procedure.

       If the parent widget is realized, its change_managed procedure is called to notify it  that  its  set  of
       managed  children  has changed.  The parent can reposition and resize any of its children.  It moves each
       child as needed by calling <b>XtMoveWidget</b>,  which  first  updates  the  x  and  y  fields  and  then  calls
       <b>XMoveWindow</b> if the widget is realized.

       The <b>XtManageChild</b> function constructs a <b>WidgetList</b> of length one and calls <b>XtManageChildren</b>.

       The <b>XtUnmanageChildren</b> function performs the following:

       •    Issues  an  error if the children do not all have the same parent or if the parent is not a subclass
            of <b>compositeWidgetClass</b>.

       •    Returns immediately if the common parent is being destroyed; otherwise, for each unique child on the
            list, <b>XtUnmanageChildren</b> performs the following:

            -    Ignores the child if it already is unmanaged or is being destroyed and marks it if not.

            -    If the child is realized, it makes it nonvisible by unmapping it.

       •    Calls the change_managed routine of the widgets' parent after all children have been marked  if  the
            parent is realized.

       <b>XtUnmanageChildren</b>  does  not destroy the children widgets.  Removing widgets from a parent's managed set
       is often a temporary banishment, and, some time later, you may manage the children again.

       The <b>XtUnmanageChild</b> function constructs a widget list of length one and calls <b>XtUnmanageChildren</b>.

       The <b>XtChangeManagedSet</b> function performs the following:

       •    Issues an error if the widgets specified in the <u>manage_children</u> and the <u>unmanage_children</u>  lists  to
            no all have the same parent, or if that parent is not a subclass of compositeWidgetClass.

       •    Returns immediately if the common parent is being destroyed.

       •    If  no  <b>CompositeClassExtension</b>  is  defined,  or  a  <b>CompositeClassExtension</b> is defined but with an
            <u>allows_change_managed_set</u> field with a value of <b>False</b>, and <b>XtChangeManagedSet</b>  was  invoked  with  a
            non-NULL <u>do_change_proc</u> procedure then <b>XtChangeManagedSet</b> performs the following:

            -    Calls <b>XtUnmanageChildren</b> (<u>unmanage_children</u>, <u>num_unmanage_children</u>).

            -    Calls the <u>do_change_proc</u> specified.

            -    Calls <b>XtManageChildren</b> (<u>manage_children</u>, <u>num_manage_children</u>) and then returns immediately.

       •    Otherwise,  if  a  <b>CompositeClassExtension</b> is defined with an <u>allows_change_managed_set</u> field with a
            value of <b>True</b>, or if no <b>CompositeClassExtension</b> is defined, and <b>XtChangeManagedSet</b> was invoked  with
            a NULL <u>do_change_proc</u> procedure, then the following is performed:

            -    For  each  child  on  the <u>unmanage_children</u> list; if the child is already unmanaged or is being
                 destroyed it is ignored, otherwise it is marked as being unmanaged and if it is realized it  is
                 made nonvisible by being unmapped.

            -    If the <u>do_change_proc</u> procedure is non-NULL then it is invoked as specified.

            -    For  each  child  on  the  <u>manage_children</u> list; if the child is already managed or it is being
                 destroyed it is ignored, otherwise it is marked as managed

       •    If the parent is realized and after all children have been marked, the change_managed method of  the
            parent is invoked and subsequently some of the newly managed children are made viewable by:

            -    Calling <b>XtRealizeWidget</b> on each of the previously unmanaged child that is unrealized.

            -    Mapping each previously unmanaged child that has <u>map_when_managed</u> <b>True</b>.

       The <b>XtIsManaged</b> function returns <b>True</b> if the specified widget is of class RectObj or any subclass thereof
       and is managed, or <b>False</b> otherwise.
