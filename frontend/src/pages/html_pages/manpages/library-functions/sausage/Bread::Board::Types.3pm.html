</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bread::Board::Types - types and coercions for Bread::Board

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.37

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package defines types and coercions for Bread::Board.

</pre><h4><b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"Bread::Board::Container::SubContainerList"</b>
       A hashref mapping strings to instances of Bread::Board::Container or
       Bread::Board::Container::Parameterized.

       Can be coerced from an arrayref of containers: the keys will be the containers' names.

   <b>"Bread::Board::Container::ServiceList"</b>
       A hashref mapping strings to instances of Bread::Board::Service.

       Can be coerced from an arrayref of services: the keys will be the services' names.

   <b>"Bread::Board::Service::Dependencies"</b>
       Hashref mapping strings to instances of Bread::Board::Dependency.

       The values of the hashref can be coerced in several different ways:

       a string
           will be interpreted as the "service_path"

       a hashref with a single key
           the key will be interpreted as a "service_path", and the value as a hashref for "service_params"

       an arrayref
           each  element  will  be interpreted as a dependency (possibly through all the coercions listed here);
           see below for an example

       a service object
           will be interpreted as a dependency on that service

       a dependency object
           will be taken as-is

       Instead of a hashref of any of the above things, you can use an arrayref: it will be coerced to  hashref,
       using the (coerced) dependencies' names as keys.

       <u>Examples</u>

          service foo =&gt; (
            class =&gt; 'Foo',
            dependencies =&gt; {
              { bar =&gt; { attribute =&gt; 12 } },
            },
          );

       The  service "foo" depends on the parameterized service "bar", and "bar" will be instantiated passing the
       hashref "{ attribute =&gt; 12 }" to its "get" method.

          service foo =&gt; (
            class =&gt; 'Foo',
            dependencies =&gt; {
              things =&gt; [ 'bar', 'baz' ],
            },
          );

       The service "foo" depends on the services "bar" and "baz", and when instantiating "foo", its  constructor
       will receive something like "things =&gt; [ $instance_of_bar, $instance_of_baz ]".

          service foo =&gt; (
            class =&gt; 'Foo',
            dependencies =&gt; {
              things =&gt; [
                { bar =&gt; { attribute =&gt; 12 } },
                { bar =&gt; { attribute =&gt; 27 } },
              ],
            },
          );

       You  can  mix&amp;match  the  coercions! This "foo" will get two different instances of "bar" in its "things"
       attribute, each "bar" instantiated with a different value.

   <b>"Bread::Board::Service::Parameters"</b>
       Hashref mapping strings to MooseX::Params::Validate specifications.

       Can be coerced from an arrayref of strings:

         [qw(a b c)]

       becomes:

         {
           a =&gt; { optional =&gt; 0 },
           b =&gt; { optional =&gt; 0 },
           c =&gt; { optional =&gt; 0 },
         }
