</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bread::Board::Manual - A manual for Bread::Board

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.37

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       As we have said, Bread::Board is an inversion of control framework with a focus on dependency injection
       and lifecycle management. The goal that Bread::Board strives towards is to promote more decoupled
       designs. It does this by removing the need for your objects to be concerned with resolving and/or
       creating their dependencies as well as knowing (or caring) what their lifecycle is.

   <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>Bread::Board</b>
       First, it should be noted that Bread::Board and IoC are not universally useful. Smaller applications and
       one-off scripts would be overburdened by the abstractions of Bread::Board. But the larger your
       application becomes, the more something like Bread::Board can help.

       As applications grow so the management of resources and their dependencies becomes more of a burden.
       Making sure all your components are properly initialized, in the right order and at all times that you
       need them, can become a twisty maze. Bread::Board is intended to help you manage this twisty maze and
       remove the need for you to manage this manually.

       Take your typical Catalyst application, the Catalyst framework itself contains its own mini IoC framework
       through the component subsystem. Catalyst will manage your models and views making sure that they will be
       available when you need them in the controllers. Catalyst makes all this easy to manage through its
       configuration system. This is great inside your Catalyst application, but what about outside of it? Any
       sufficiently complex web application will have a set of scripts and/or command-line applications to help
       support it. At this point you are left to your own devices and must manage these components and their
       dependency chains on your own.

       By decoupling IoC into its own stand-alone subsystem it becomes possible to get that same ease-of-use you
       get inside something like a Catalyst application, outside of it.

       This, in a nutshell, is what Bread::Board aims to provide.

</pre><h4><b>SECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Bread::Board::Manual::Concepts
           This  is  perhaps  the  best place to start, it will introduce you to the basic concepts that make up
           Bread::Board.

       Bread::Board::Manual::Concepts::Typemap
           With Bread::Board you provide names for your service so that you can find them later.  This  document
           explores  the  new  (read: experimental) typemap feature which allows you to map services to types as
           well.

       Bread::Board::Manual::Concepts::Advanced
           Bread::Board is an extensible and open  system,  this  document  will  explore  how  you  can  extend
           Bread::Board and get greater re-use of your components.

       Bread::Board::Manual::Example
           This  is  a set of examples meant to show how Bread::Board can be used in real-world scenarios. It is
           recommended that you read the above documentation first as many of these examples  use  the  concepts
           discussed in them.
