</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::DNS::Resolver::Recurse - DNS recursive resolver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Net::DNS::Resolver::Recurse;

               my $resolver = new Net::DNS::Resolver::Recurse();

               $resolver-&gt;hints('198.41.0.4'); # A.ROOT-SERVER.NET.

               my $packet = $resolver-&gt;send( 'www.rob.com.au.', 'A' );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module resolves queries by following the delegation path from the DNS root.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This module inherits almost all the methods from Net::DNS::Resolver.  Additional module-specific methods
       are described below.

   <b>hints</b>
       This method specifies a list of the IP addresses of nameservers to be used to discover the addresses of
       the root nameservers.

               $resolver-&gt;hints(@ip);

       If no hints are passed, the priming query is directed to nameservers drawn from a built-in list of IP
       addresses.

   <b>query,</b> <b>search,</b> <b>send</b>
       The <b>query()</b>, <b>search()</b> and <b>send()</b> methods produce the same result as their counterparts in
       Net::DNS::Resolver.

               $packet = $resolver-&gt;send( 'www.example.com.', 'A' );

       Server-side recursion is suppressed by clearing the recurse flag in query packets and recursive name
       resolution is performed explicitly.

       The <b>query()</b> and <b>search()</b> methods are inherited from Net::DNS::Resolver and invoke <b>send()</b> indirectly.

   <b>callback</b>
       This method specifies a code reference to a subroutine, which is then invoked at each stage of the
       recursive lookup.

       For example to emulate dig's "+trace" function:

               my $coderef = sub {
               my $packet = shift;

               printf ";; Received %d bytes from %s\n\n",
                       $packet-&gt;answersize, $packet-&gt;answerfrom;
               };

               $resolver-&gt;callback($coderef);

       The callback subroutine is not called for queries for missing glue records.
