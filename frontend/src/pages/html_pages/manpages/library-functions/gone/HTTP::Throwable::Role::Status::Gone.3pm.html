</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::Gone - 410 Gone

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.028

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The requested resource is no longer available at the server and no forwarding address is known. This
       condition is expected to be considered permanent. Clients with link editing capabilities SHOULD delete
       references to the Request-URI after user approval.  If the server does not know, or has no facility to
       determine, whether or not the condition is permanent, the status code 404 (Not Found) SHOULD be used
       instead. This response is cacheable unless indicated otherwise.

       The 410 response is primarily intended to assist the task of web maintenance by notifying the recipient
       that the resource is intentionally unavailable and that the server owners desire that remote links to
       that resource be removed. Such an event is common for limited-time, promotional services and for
       resources belonging to individuals no longer working at the server's site. It is not necessary to mark
       all permanently unavailable resources as "gone" or to keep the mark for any length of time -- that is
       left to the discretion of the server owner.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
