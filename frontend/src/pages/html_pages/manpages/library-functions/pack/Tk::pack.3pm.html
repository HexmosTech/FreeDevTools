       Tk::pack - Geometry manager that packs around edges of cavity

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>pack</b>?(<u>args</u>)?

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>pack</b><u>Option</u>?(<u>args</u>)?

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>pack</b> method is used to communicate with the packer, a geometry manager that arranges the children of
       a parent by packing them in order around the edges of the parent.

       In this <b>perl</b> port of Tk it is normal to pack widgets one-at-a-time using the widget object to be packed
       to invoke a method call.  This is a slight distortion of underlying Tk interface (which can handle lists
       of windows to one pack method call) but has proven effective in practice.

       The <b>pack</b> method can have any of several forms, depending on <u>Option</u>:

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>pack</b>?(<u>options</u>)?
           The  options  consist  of  pairs  of arguments that specify how to manage the slave.  See "THE PACKER
           ALGORITHM" below for details on how the options are used by the packer.  The  following  options  are
           supported:

           <b>-after</b> =&gt; <u>$other</u>
                   <u>$other</u>  must  be  another window.  Use its master as the master for the slave, and insert the
                   slave just after <u>$other</u> in the packing order.

           <b>-anchor</b> =&gt; <u>anchor</u>
                   <u>Anchor</u> must be a valid anchor position such as <b>n</b> or <b>sw</b>; it specifies where to  position  each
                   slave in its parcel.  Defaults to <b>center</b>.

           <b>-before</b> =&gt; <u>$other</u>
                   <u>$other</u>  must  be  another window.  Use its master as the master for the slave, and insert the
                   slave just before <u>$other</u> in the packing order.

           <b>-expand</b> =&gt; <u>boolean</u>
                   Specifies whether the slave should be expanded  to  consume  extra  space  in  their  master.
                   <u>Boolean</u> may have any proper boolean value, such as <b>1</b> or <b>no</b>.  Defaults to 0.

           <b>-fill</b> =&gt; <u>style</u>
                   If  a  slave's  parcel  is  larger  than its requested dimensions, this option may be used to
                   stretch the slave.  <u>Style</u> must have one of the following values:

                   <b>none</b>        Give the slave its requested dimensions plus any internal padding requested  with
                               <b>-ipadx</b> or <b>-ipady</b>.  This is the default.

                   <b>x</b>           Stretch  the  slave  horizontally  to fill the entire width of its parcel (except
                               leave external padding as specified by <b>-padx</b>).

                   <b>y</b>           Stretch the slave vertically to fill the entire  height  of  its  parcel  (except
                               leave external padding as specified by <b>-pady</b>).

                   <b>both</b>        Stretch the slave both horizontally and vertically.

           <b>-in</b> =&gt; <u>$master</u>
                   Insert the slave(s) at the end of the packing order for the master window given by <u>$master</u>.

           <b>-ipadx</b> =&gt; <u>amount</u>
                   <u>Amount</u>  specifies how much horizontal internal padding to leave on each side of the slave(s).
                   <u>Amount</u> must be a valid screen distance, such as <b>2</b> or <b>.5c</b>.  It defaults to 0.

           <b>-ipady</b> =&gt; <u>amount</u>
                   <u>Amount</u> specifies how much vertical internal padding to leave on each side  of  the  slave(s).
                   <u>Amount</u>  defaults to 0.

           <b>-padx</b> =&gt; <u>amount</u>
                   <u>Amount</u>  specifies how much horizontal external padding to leave on each side of the slave(s).
                   <u>Amount</u> defaults to 0.

           <b>-pady</b> =&gt; <u>amount</u>
                   <u>Amount</u> specifies how much vertical external padding to leave on each side  of  the  slave(s).
                   <u>Amount</u> defaults to 0.

           <b>-side</b> =&gt; <u>side</u>
                   Specifies which side of the master the slave(s) will be packed against.  Must be <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>,
                   <b>top</b>, or <b>bottom</b>.  Defaults to <b>top</b>.

       If  no  <b>-in</b>,  <b>-after</b> or <b>-before</b> option is specified then slave will be inserted at the end of the packing
       list for its parent unless it is already managed by the packer (in which case it will be  left  where  it
       is).   If  one  of these options is specified then slave will be inserted at the specified point.  If the
       slave are already managed by the geometry manager then any unspecified  options  for  them  retain  their
       previous values rather than receiving default values.

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>packConfigure</b>?(<u>options</u>)?
           Same as <b>pack</b>.

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>packForget</b>
           Removes  <u>slave</u> from the packing order for its master and unmaps its window.  The slave will no longer
           be managed by the packer.

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>packInfo</b>
           Returns a list whose elements are the current configuration state of the slave given by <u>$slave</u> in the
           same option-value form that might be specified to <b>packConfigure</b>.  The first two elements of the  list
           are ``<b>-in</b>=&gt;<u>$master</u>'' where <u>$master</u> is the slave's master.

       <u>$master</u>-&gt;<b>packPropagate</b>?(<u>boolean</u>)?
           If  <u>boolean</u>  has  a  true boolean value such as <b>1</b> or <b>on</b> then propagation is enabled for <u>$master</u>, (see
           "GEOMETRY PROPAGATION" below).  If <u>boolean</u> has a false boolean value then propagation is disabled for
           <u>$master</u>.  In either of these cases an empty string is returned.   If  <u>boolean</u>  is  omitted  then  the
           method  returns <b>0</b> or <b>1</b> to indicate whether propagation is currently enabled for <u>$master</u>.  Propagation
           is enabled by default.

       <u>$master</u>-&gt;<b>packSlaves</b>
           Returns a list of all of the slaves in the packing order for <u>$master</u>.  The order of the slaves in the
           list is the same as their order in the packing order.   If  <u>$master</u>  has  no  slaves  then  an  empty
           list/string is returned in array/scalar context, respectively

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>PACKER</b> <b>ALGORITHM</b></h4><pre>
       For each master the packer maintains an ordered list of slaves called the <u>packing</u> <u>list</u>.  The <b>-in</b>, <b>-after</b>,
       and  <b>-before</b> configuration options are used to specify the master for each slave and the slave's position
       in the packing list.  If none of these options is given for a slave then the slave is added to the end of
       the packing list for its parent.

       The packer arranges the slaves for a master by scanning the packing  list  in  order.   At  the  time  it
       processes each slave, a rectangular area within the master is still unallocated.  This area is called the
       <u>cavity</u>;  for the first slave it is the entire area of the master.

       For each slave the packer carries out the following steps:

       [1] The  packer  allocates  a  rectangular <u>parcel</u> for the slave along the side of the cavity given by the
           slave's <b>-side</b> option.  If the side is top or bottom then the width of the parcel is the width of  the
           cavity  and  its  height is the requested height of the slave plus the <b>-ipady</b> and <b>-pady</b> options.  For
           the left or right side the height of the parcel is the height of the cavity  and  the  width  is  the
           requested  width  of the slave plus the <b>-ipadx</b> and <b>-padx</b> options.  The parcel may be enlarged further
           because of the <b>-expand</b> option (see "EXPANSION" below)

       [2] The packer chooses the dimensions of the slave.  The width will normally  be  the  slave's  requested
           width  plus twice its <b>-ipadx</b> option and the height will normally be the slave's requested height plus
           twice its <b>-ipady</b> option.  However, if the <b>-fill</b> option is <b>x</b> or <b>both</b> then the width of  the  slave  is
           expanded  to fill the width of the parcel, minus twice the <b>-padx</b> option.  If the <b>-fill</b> option is <b>y</b> or
           <b>both</b> then the height of the slave is expanded to fill the width of the parcel, minus twice the  <b>-pady</b>
           option.

       [3] The  packer  positions  the  slave over its parcel.  If the slave is smaller than the parcel then the
           <b>-anchor</b> option determines where in the parcel the slave will be placed.  If <b>-padx</b> or  <b>-pady</b>  is  non-
           zero,  then  the given amount of external padding will always be left between the slave and the edges
           of the parcel.

           Once a given slave has been packed, the area of its parcel is subtracted from the cavity,  leaving  a
           smaller  rectangular cavity for the next slave.  If a slave doesn't use all of its parcel, the unused
           space in the parcel will not be used by subsequent slaves.  If the cavity should become too small  to
           meet  the needs of a slave then the slave will be given whatever space is left in the cavity.  If the
           cavity shrinks to zero size, then all remaining slaves on the packing list will be unmapped from  the
           screen until the master window becomes large enough to hold them again.

</pre><h4><b>EXPANSION</b></h4><pre>
       If a master window is so large that there will be extra space left over after all of its slaves have been
       packed,  then  the  extra  space  is  distributed uniformly among all of the slaves for which the <b>-expand</b>
       option is set.  Extra horizontal space is distributed among the expandable slaves whose <b>-side</b> is <b>left</b>  or
       <b>right</b>, and extra vertical space is distributed among the expandable slaves whose <b>-side</b> is <b>top</b> or <b>bottom</b>.

</pre><h4><b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>PROPAGATION</b></h4><pre>
       The packer normally computes how large a master must be to just exactly meet the needs of its slaves, and
       it  sets  the  requested  width  and  height  of  the  master  to these dimensions.  This causes geometry
       information to propagate up through a window hierarchy to a top-level window so that the entire  sub-tree
       sizes itself to fit the needs of the leaf windows.  However, the <b>packPropagate</b> method may be used to turn
       off  propagation  for  one  or more masters.  If propagation is disabled then the packer will not set the
       requested width and height of the packer.  This may be useful if, for example,  you  wish  for  a  master
       window to have a fixed size that you specify.

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b> <b>ON</b> <b>MASTER</b> <b>WINDOWS</b></h4><pre>
       The  master for each slave must either be the slave's parent (the default) or a descendant of the slave's
       parent.  This restriction is necessary to guarantee that the slave can be placed over  any  part  of  its
       master that is visible without danger of the slave being clipped by its parent.

</pre><h4><b>PACKING</b> <b>ORDER</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  master  for  a  slave  is not its parent then you must make sure that the slave is higher in the
       stacking order than the master.  Otherwise the master will obscure the slave and it will appear as if the
       slave hasn't been packed correctly.  The easiest way to make sure the slave is higher than the master  is
       to  create  the  master  window  first:  the most recently created window will be highest in the stacking
       order.  Or, you can use the <b>raise</b> and <b>lower</b> methods to change the stacking order of either the master  or
       the slave.
