       Perl::Critic::Policy::Miscellanea::ProhibitUselessNoCritic - Remove ineffective "## no critic"
       annotations.

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is part of the core Perl::Critic distribution.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sometimes, you may need to use a "## no critic" annotation to work around a false-positive bug in
       Perl::Critic.  But eventually, that bug might get fixed, leaving your code with extra "## no critic"
       annotations lying about.  Or you may use them to locally disable a Policy, but then later decide to
       permanently remove that Policy entirely from your profile, making some of those "## no critic"
       annotations pointless.  Or, you may accidentally disable too many Policies at once, creating an
       opportunity for new violations to slip in unnoticed.

       This Policy will emit violations if you have a "## no critic" annotation in your source code that does
       not actually suppress any violations given your current profile.  To resolve this, you should either
       remove the annotation entirely, or adjust the Policy name patterns in the annotation to match only the
       Policies that are actually being violated in your code.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       For example, let's say I have a regex, but I don't want to use the "/x" flag, which violates the
       "RegularExpressions::RequireExtendedFormatting" policy.  In the following code, the "## no critic"
       annotation will suppress violations of that Policy and ALL Policies that match "m/RegularExpressions/imx"

         my $re = qr/foo bar baz/ms;  ## no critic (RegularExpressions)

       However, this creates a potential loop-hole for someone to introduce additional violations in the future,
       without explicitly acknowledging them.  This Policy is designed to catch these situations by warning you
       that you've disabled more Policies than the situation really requires.  The above code should be remedied
       like this:

         my $re = qr/foo bar baz/ms;  ## no critic (RequireExtendedFormatting)

       Notice how the "RequireExtendedFormatting" pattern more precisely matches the name of the Policy that I'm
       trying to suppress.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       Changing your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file and disabling policies globally or running at a higher (i.e. less
       restrictive) severity level may cause this Policy to emit additional violations.  So you might want to
       defer using this Policy until you have a fairly stable profile.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is not configurable except for the standard options.
