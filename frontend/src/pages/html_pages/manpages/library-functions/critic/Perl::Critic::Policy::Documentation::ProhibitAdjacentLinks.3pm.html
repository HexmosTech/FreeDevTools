</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::ProhibitAdjacentLinks - consecutive L&lt;&gt; links

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy is part of the "Perl::Critic::Pulp" add-on.  It asks you not to have two adjacent L&lt;&gt;
       sequences in a paragraph.  For example,

           =head1 SEE ALSO

           L&lt;Foo&gt;               # bad
           L&lt;Bar&gt;

       The idea is adjacent L&lt;&gt; like this is probably a missing comma or missing text.  It's easy to make this
       mistake in a "SEE ALSO" list.

       This is normally only very minor and on that basis this policy is lowest severity and under the
       "cosmetic" theme (see "POLICY THEMES" in Perl::Critic).

   <b>Exceptions</b>
       An exception is made for two links to the same page where one (or both) have display text,

           See L&lt;My::Package&gt; L&lt;new()|My::Package/Contructors&gt; for more.

       This hyperlinks both the package name and a function etc within it.  Perhaps exactly when to allow or
       disallow this might be loosened or tightened in the future.  Adjacent linking is fairly unusual though,
       and too much linking is often not a good thing since the meaning ought to be made clear in plain text
       too.

   <b>Disabling</b>
       If you don't care about this sort of thing at all you can disable "ProhibitAdjacentLinks" from your
       <u>.perlcriticrc</u> in the usual way (see "CONFIGURATION" in Perl::Critic),

           [-Documentation::ProhibitAdjacentLinks]

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The column position of the offending adjacency is not included in the violation reported.  You may need
       to look carefully at the line to see the problem, and at the following line if the adjacent link is on
       the next line.
