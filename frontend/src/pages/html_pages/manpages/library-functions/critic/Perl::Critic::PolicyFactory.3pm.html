</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::PolicyFactory - Instantiates Policy objects.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a helper class that instantiates Perl::Critic::Policy objects with the user's preferred
       parameters. There are no user-serviceable parts here.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       This is considered to be a non-public class.  Its interface is subject to change without notice.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       "new( -profile =&gt; $profile, -errors =&gt; $config_errors )"
           Returns a reference to a new Perl::Critic::PolicyFactory object.

           <b>-profile</b> is a reference to a Perl::Critic::UserProfile object.  This argument is required.

           <b>-errors</b>  is a reference to an instance of Perl::Critic::ConfigErrors.  This argument is optional.  If
           specified, than any problems found will be added to the object.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "create_policy( -name =&gt; $policy_name, -params =&gt; \%param_hash )"
           Creates one Policy object.  If the object cannot be instantiated, it will throw  a  fatal  exception.
           Otherwise, it returns a reference to the new Policy object.

           <b>-name</b>  is  the name of a Perl::Critic::Policy subclass module.  The 'Perl::Critic::Policy' portion of
           the name can be omitted for brevity.  This argument is required.

           <b>-params</b> is an optional reference to hash of parameters that will be passed into  the  constructor  of
           the  Policy.   If  "-params"  is  not defined, we will use the appropriate Policy parameters from the
           Perl::Critic::UserProfile.

           Note that the Policy will not have had "initialize_if_enabled" in Perl::Critic::Policy invoked on it,
           so it may not yet be usable.

        create_all_policies()
           Constructs and returns one instance of each Perl::Critic::Policy subclass that is  installed  on  the
           local  system.   Each  Policy  will  be  created  with  the  appropriate  parameters  from the user's
           configuration profile.

           Note that the Policies will not have had "initialize_if_enabled" in Perl::Critic::Policy  invoked  on
           them, so they may not yet be usable.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::PolicyFactory  has  a few static subroutines that are used internally, but may be useful to
       you in some way.

       site_policy_names()
           Returns a list of all the Policy modules that are  currently  installed  in  the  Perl::Critic:Policy
           namespace.   These  will  include modules that are distributed with Perl::Critic plus any third-party
           modules that have been installed.
