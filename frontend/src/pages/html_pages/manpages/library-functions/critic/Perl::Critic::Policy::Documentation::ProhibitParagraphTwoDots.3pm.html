       Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::ProhibitParagraphTwoDots - don't end a paragraph with two dots

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy is part of the "Perl::Critic::Pulp" add-on.  It asks you not to end a POD paragraph with two
       dots,

           Some thing..                    # bad

       This is a surprisingly easy typo, but of course is entirely cosmetic and on that basis this policy is
       lowest severity and under the "cosmetic" theme (see "POLICY THEMES" in Perl::Critic).

       Three or more dots as an ellipsis is fine,

           And some more of this ...       # ok

       and anything within a paragraph is fine,

           Numbers 1 .. 10 are handled.    # ok

       Only text paragraphs are checked.  Verbatim paragraphs can end with anything at all

           This is an example,

               example_code (1 ..          # ok

       There might be other dubious paragraph endings this policy could pick up, but things like ";." or ":."
       can arise from code or smiley faces, so at the moment only two dots are bad.

   <b>Disabling</b>
       If you don't care about this you can disable "ProhibitParagraphTwoDots" from your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> in the
       usual way (see "CONFIGURATION" in Perl::Critic),

           [-Documentation::ProhibitParagraphTwoDots]

       A "## no critic" directive works in new enough "Perl::Critic", but if you have an "__END__" token then
       any "no critic" generally must be before that.
