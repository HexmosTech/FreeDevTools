</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Statistics - Compile stats on Perl::Critic violations.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class accumulates statistics on Perl::Critic violations across one or more files.  NOTE: This class
       is experimental and subject to change.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       This is considered to be a non-public class.  Its interface is subject to change without notice.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new()
           Create a new instance of Perl::Critic::Statistics.  No arguments are supported at this time.

       " accumulate( $doc, \@violations ) "
           Accumulates statistics about the $doc and the @violations that were found.

       modules()
           The number of chunks of code (usually files) that have been analyzed.

       subs()
           The total number of subroutines analyzed by this Critic.

       statements()
           The total number of statements analyzed by this Critic.

       lines()
           The total number of lines of code analyzed by this Critic.

       lines_of_blank()
           The  total number of blank lines analyzed by this Critic. This includes only blank lines in code, not
           POD or data.

       lines_of_comment()
           The total number of comment lines analyzed by this Critic. This includes only lines whose first  non-
           whitespace character is "#".

       lines_of_data()
           The  total  number  of  lines  of data section analyzed by this Critic, not counting the "__END__" or
           "__DATA__" line. POD in a data section is counted as POD, not data.

       lines_of_perl()
           The total number of lines of Perl code analyzed by this Critic. Perl appearing in the data section is
           not counted.

       lines_of_pod()
           The total number of lines of POD analyzed by this Critic. Pod occurring in a data section is  counted
           as POD, not as data.

       violations_by_severity()
           The  number  of  violations  of  each severity found by this Critic as a reference to a hash keyed by
           severity.

       violations_by_policy()
           The number of violations of each policy found by this Critic as a reference to a hash keyed  by  full
           policy name.

       total_violations()
           The total number of violations found by this Critic.

       statements_other_than_subs()
           The  total  number  of  statements  minus  the number of subroutines.  Useful because a subroutine is
           considered a statement by PPI.

       average_sub_mccabe()
           The average McCabe score of all scanned subroutines.

       violations_per_file()
           The total violations divided by the number of modules.

       violations_per_statement()
           The total violations divided by the number statements minus subroutines.

       violations_per_line_of_code()
           The total violations divided by the lines of code.
