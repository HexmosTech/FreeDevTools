</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Pulp - some add-on perlcritic policies

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a collection of add-on policies for "Perl::Critic".  They're under a "pulp" theme plus other
       themes according to their purpose (see "POLICY THEMES" in Perl::Critic).

   <b>Bugs</b>
       CodeLayout::ProhibitFatCommaNewline
           Avoid newline before "=&gt;" not quoting.

       CodeLayout::ProhibitIfIfSameLine
           Avoid "} if () {" perhaps meant to be "elsif".

       Miscellanea::TextDomainPlaceholders
           Check keyword arguments to "__x()", "__nx()", etc.

       Modules::ProhibitUseQuotedVersion
           Don't quote a version requirement like "use Foo '1.5'"

       ValuesAndExpressions::RequireNumericVersion
           $VERSION plain number for comparisons and checking.

       ValuesAndExpressions::ConstantBeforeLt
           Avoid problems with "FOO &lt; 123"

       ValuesAndExpressions::NotWithCompare
           Avoid problems with "! $x == $y"

       ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitArrayAssignAref
           Dubious "@array=[1,2,3]" array/arrayref assignments.

       ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitDuplicateHashKeys
           Duplicate literal keys "%h = (xyz=&gt;123, xyz=&gt;456)".

       ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitFiletest_f
           Don't use "-f".

       ValuesAndExpressions::UnexpandedSpecialLiteral
           "__PACKAGE__" etc special words not expanding.

   <b>Compatibility</b>
       Compatibility::ConstantPragmaHash
           Version requirement for hash style multi-constants.

       Compatibility::ConstantLeadingUnderscore
           Version requirement for constants with leading underscore.

       Compatibility::Gtk2Constants
           Gtk2 module version requirement for some constants.

       Compatibility::PerlMinimumVersionAndWhy
           Perl version declared against features used.

       Compatibility::PodMinimumVersion
           Perl version declared against POD features used.

       Compatibility::ProhibitUnixDevNull
           Prefer "File::Spec-&gt;devnull" over <u>/dev/null</u>.

   <b>Efficiency</b>
       Documentation::RequireEndBeforeLastPod
           Put "__END__" before POD at end of file.

       Miscellanea::TextDomainUnused
           "Locale::TextDomain" imported but not used.

       Modules::ProhibitPOSIXimport
           Don't import the whole of "POSIX".

   <b>Cosmetic</b>
       CodeLayout::RequireTrailingCommaAtNewline
           Comma "," at the end of list, if at a newline.

       CodeLayout::RequireFinalSemicolon
           Semicolon ";" on the last statement of a subroutine or block.

       ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitEmptyCommas
           Stray consecutive commas ",,"

       ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitNullStatements
           Stray semicolons ";"

       ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitUnknownBackslash
           Unknown "\z" etc escapes in strings.

       ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitBarewordDoubleColon

           Unbalanced or mismatched ( ) parens, brackets and braces.

           Put commas or some text between adjacent "L&lt;&gt;" links.

       Documentation::ProhibitDuplicateHeadings
           Don't duplicate "=head" headings.

       Documentation::ProhibitDuplicateSeeAlso
           Don't duplicate "L&lt;&gt;" links in SEE ALSO sections.

       Documentation::ProhibitBadAproposMarkup
           Avoid "C&lt;&gt;" in NAME section, bad for man's "apropos" output.

       Documentation::RequireFilenameMarkup
           Markup /foo filenames.

       Documentation::ProhibitLinkToSelf
           Don't "L&lt;&gt;" link to the document itself.

           Don't end paragraph with ".." (stray extra dot).

       Documentation::ProhibitVerbatimMarkup
           Verbatim paragraphs not expanding "C&lt;&gt;" etc markup.

           Have a "=cut" at end of file.

       Documentation::RequireLinkedURLs
           Use "L&lt;&gt;" markup on URLs.

   <b>Selecting</b>
       You can always enable or disable the policies you do or don't want (see "CONFIGURATION" in Perl::Critic).
       You may have already realized that there's a wide range of builtin and add-on perlcritic policies ranging
       from  buggy  practice  to  deliberately  restrictive  or  even  quite  bizarre.  You're not meant to pass
       everything.  Some policies may even be mutually contradictory.

       The  restrictive  policies  are  meant  as  building   blocks   for   a   house   style.    For   example
       "ProhibitBarewordDoubleColon"  here,  or something like "ProhibitUnlessBlocks".  They're usually a matter
       of personal preference, and "non de gustibus disputandum" as they say in the classics.  Trying to  follow
       all  such  policies  would give away big parts of the language and quite likely result in very un-typical
       code.

       Some of the restrictive policies  are  geared  towards  beginners.   "ProhibitUnknownBackslash"  here  or
       "RequireInitializationForLocalVars" are along those lines.  There might for instance be good backslashing
       which  the  prohibition  doesn't  recognise,  or  local  variable  initializers  make no sense for output
       variables like $!, once you get to the level of knowing to use "local" to preserve such globals.

       In general the POD of each policy is supposed to explain the motivation so you can see whether  you  want
       it  or  not.   If  you're  not  turning off or drastically customizing at least half of all policies then
       you're either not trying or you're much too easily lead!

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       In most of the perlcritic documentation, including the Pulp add-ons here, policy names appear without the
       full "Perl::Critic::Policy::..." class  part.   In  Emacs  try  "man-completion.el"  to  make  "M-x  man"
       automatically expand a suffix part at point, or "ffap-perl-module.el" for the same to go to the source.

       •   &lt;<a href="http://user42.tuxfamily.org/man-completion/index.html">http://user42.tuxfamily.org/man-completion/index.html</a>&gt;

       •   &lt;<a href="http://user42.tuxfamily.org/ffap-perl-module/index.html">http://user42.tuxfamily.org/ffap-perl-module/index.html</a>&gt;

       In perlcritic's output you can ask for %P to see the full policy package name to run "perldoc" or copy or
       follow  etc.   Here's a good output format you can put in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u>.  The file:line:column: part
       is a style Emacs will recognise.

           verbose=%f:%l:%c:\n %P\n %m\n

       See Perl::Critic::Violation for all available "%" escapes.  "perlcritic.el" which comes  with  perlcritic
       has  regexp  patterns  for  Emacs  to recognise the builtin perlcritic formats, but it's easier to output
       "file:line:column:" in the first place.
