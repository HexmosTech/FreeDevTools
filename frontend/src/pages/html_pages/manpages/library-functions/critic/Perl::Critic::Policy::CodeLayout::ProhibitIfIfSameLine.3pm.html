       Perl::Critic::Policy::CodeLayout::ProhibitIfIfSameLine - don't put if after if on same line

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy is part of the "Perl::Critic::Pulp" add-on.  It asks you to not to write an "if" statement on
       the same line as a preceding "if".

           if ($x) {
             ...
           } if ($y) {       # bad
             ...
           }

           if ($x) {
             ...
           } elsif ($y) {    # was "elsif" intended ?
             ...
           }

       The idea is that an "if" in the layout of an "elsif" may be either a mistake or will be confusing to a
       human reader.  On that basis this policy is under the "bugs" theme and medium severity (see "POLICY
       THEMES" in Perl::Critic).

   <b>Unless</b>
       An "unless...if" is treated the same.  Perl allows "unless ... elsif" and so the same potential confusion
       with an "elsif" layout arises.

           unless ($x) {
             ...
           } if ($y) {       # bad
             ...
           }

           unless ($x) {
             ...
           } elsif ($y) {    # maybe meant to be "elsif" like this ?
             ...
           }

       Whether "unless ... elsif" is a good idea at all is another matter.  Sometimes it suits a combination of
       conditions.

   <b>Statement</b> <b>Modifiers</b>
       This policy only applies to a statement followed by a statement.  An "if" as a statement modifier is not
       affected.  It's usual to put that on the same line as the statement it modifies.

           do {
             ...
           } if ($x);        # ok, statement modifier

   <b>All</b> <b>One</b> <b>Line</b>
       Two "if" statements written on the same line will trigger the policy.

           <a href="../man1/if.1.html">if</a>(1){one;}   <a href="../man2/if.2.html">if</a>(2){two;}      # bad

       Perhaps there could be an exception or option when both statements are entirely on the one line, or some
       such, for code which is trying to be compact.

   <b>Disabling</b>
       As always if you don't care about this then you can disable "ProhibitIfIfSameLine" from your
       <u>.perlcriticrc</u> (see "CONFIGURATION" in Perl::Critic),

           [-CodeLayout::ProhibitIfIfSameLine]
