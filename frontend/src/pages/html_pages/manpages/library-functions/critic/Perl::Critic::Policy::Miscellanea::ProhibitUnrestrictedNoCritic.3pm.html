       Perl::Critic::Policy::Miscellanea::ProhibitUnrestrictedNoCritic - Forbid a bare "## no critic"

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is part of the core Perl::Critic distribution.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A bare "## no critic" annotation will disable <b>all</b> the active Policies.  This creates holes for other,
       unintended violations to appear in your code.  It is better to disable <b>only</b> the particular Policies that
       you need to get around.  By putting Policy names in a comma-separated list after the "## no critic"
       annotation, then it will only disable the named Policies.  Policy names are matched as regular
       expressions, so you can use shortened Policy names, or patterns that match several Policies. This Policy
       generates a violation any time that an unrestricted "## no critic" annotation appears.

           ## no critic                     # not ok
           ## no critic ''                  # not ok
           ## no critic ()                  # not ok
           ## no critic qw()                # not ok

           ## no critic   (Policy1, Policy2)  # ok
           ## no critic   (Policy1 Policy2)   # ok (can use spaces to separate)
           ## no critic qw(Policy1 Policy2)   # ok (the preferred style)

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       Unfortunately, Perl::Critic is very sloppy about parsing the Policy names that appear after a "##no
       critic" annotation.  For example, you might be using one of these broken syntaxes...

           ## no critic Policy1 Policy2
           ## no critic 'Policy1, Policy2'
           ## no critic "Policy1, Policy2"
           ## no critic "Policy1", "Policy2"

       In all of these cases, Perl::Critic will silently disable <b>all</b> Policies, rather than just the ones you
       requested.  But if you use the "ProhibitUnrestrictedNoCritic" Policy, all of these will generate
       violations.  That way, you can track them down and correct them to use the correct syntax, as shown above
       in the "DESCRIPTION".  If you've been using the syntax that is shown throughout the Perl::Critic
       documentation for the last few years, then you should be fine.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is not configurable except for the standard options.
