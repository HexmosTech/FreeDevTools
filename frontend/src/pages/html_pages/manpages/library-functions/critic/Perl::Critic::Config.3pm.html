</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Config - The final derived Perl::Critic configuration, combined from any profile file and
       command-line parameters.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Config takes care of finding and processing user-preferences for Perl::Critic.  The Config
       object defines which Policy modules will be loaded into the Perl::Critic engine and how they should be
       configured.  You should never really need to instantiate Perl::Critic::Config directly because the
       Perl::Critic constructor will do it for you.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       This is considered to be a non-public class.  Its interface is subject to change without notice.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       new(...)
           Not properly documented because you shouldn't be using this.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "add_policy( -policy =&gt; $policy_name, -params =&gt; \%param_hash )"
           Creates a Policy object and loads it into this Config.  If the object cannot be instantiated, it will
           throw a fatal exception.  Otherwise, it returns a reference to this Critic.

           <b>-policy</b> is the name of a Perl::Critic::Policy subclass module.  The 'Perl::Critic::Policy' portion of
           the name can be omitted for brevity.  This argument is required.

           <b>-params</b> is an optional reference to a hash of Policy parameters.  The contents of this hash reference
           will  be  passed into to the constructor of the Policy module.  See the documentation in the relevant
           Policy module for a description of the arguments it supports.

        all_policies_enabled_or_not()
           Returns a list containing references to all the Policy objects that have been seen.   Note  that  the
           state  of  these  objects  is not trustworthy.  In particular, it is likely that some of them are not
           prepared to examine any documents.

        policies()
           Returns a list containing references to all the Policy objects that have been enabled and loaded into
           this Config.

        exclude()
           Returns the value of the "-exclude" attribute for this Config.

        include()
           Returns the value of the "-include" attribute for this Config.

        force()
           Returns the value of the "-force" attribute for this Config.

        only()
           Returns the value of the "-only" attribute for this Config.

        profile_strictness()
           Returns the value of the "-profile-strictness" attribute for this Config.

        severity()
           Returns the value of the "-severity" attribute for this Config.

        single_policy()
           Returns the value of the "-single-policy" attribute for this Config.

        theme()
           Returns the Perl::Critic::Theme object that was created for this Config.

        top()
           Returns the value of the "-top" attribute for this Config.

        verbose()
           Returns the value of the "-verbose" attribute for this Config.

        color()
           Returns the value of the "-color" attribute for this Config.

        pager()
           Returns the value of the "-pager" attribute for this Config.

        unsafe_allowed()
           Returns the value of the "-allow-unsafe" attribute for this Config.

        criticism_fatal()
           Returns the value of the "-criticism-fatal" attribute for this Config.

        color_severity_highest()
           Returns the value of the "-color-severity-highest" attribute for this Config.

        color_severity_high()
           Returns the value of the "-color-severity-high" attribute for this Config.

        color_severity_medium()
           Returns the value of the "-color-severity-medium" attribute for this Config.

        color_severity_low()
           Returns the value of the "-color-severity-low" attribute for this Config.

        color_severity_lowest()
           Returns the value of the "-color-severity-lowest" attribute for this Config.

        program_extensions()
           Returns the value of the "-program_extensions" attribute for this Config.  This is an  array  of  the
           file name extensions that represent program files.

        program_extensions_as_regexes()
           Returns  the  value  of  the  "-program_extensions"  attribute  for this Config, as an array of case-
           sensitive regexes matching the ends of the file names that represent program files.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Config has a few static subroutines that are used internally, but may be useful to  you  in
       some way.

       site_policy_names()
           Returns  a  list  of  all  the Policy modules that are currently installed in the Perl::Critic:Policy
           namespace.  These will include modules that are distributed with Perl::Critic  plus  any  third-party
           modules that have been installed.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Most of the settings for Perl::Critic and each of the Policy modules can be controlled by a configuration
       file.   The  default configuration file is called <u>.perlcriticrc</u>.  Perl::Critic::Config will look for this
       file in the current directory first, and then in your home directory.  Alternatively,  you  can  set  the
       "PERLCRITIC"  environment  variable to explicitly point to a different file in another location.  If none
       of these files exist, and the "-profile" option is not given to the constructor, then all  Policies  will
       be loaded with their default configuration.

       The  format  of  the  configuration  file  is  a  series of INI-style blocks that contain key-value pairs
       separated by '='. Comments should start with '#' and can be placed on a separate line or after the  name-
       value pairs if you desire.

       Default  settings  for Perl::Critic itself can be set <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>named</b> <b>block.</b>  For example, putting
       any or all of these at  the  top  of  your  configuration  file  will  set  the  default  value  for  the
       corresponding Perl::Critic constructor argument.

           severity  = 3                                     #Integer from 1 to 5
           only      = 1                                     #Zero or One
           force     = 0                                     #Zero or One
           verbose   = 4                                     #Integer or format spec
           top       = 50                                    #A positive integer
           theme     = risky + (pbp * security) - cosmetic   #A theme expression
           include   = NamingConventions ClassHierarchies    #Space-delimited list
           exclude   = Variables  Modules::RequirePackage    #Space-delimited list
           color     = 1                                     #Zero or One
           allow_unsafe = 1                                  #Zero or One
           color-severity-highest = bold red                 #Term::ANSIColor
           color-severity-high = magenta                     #Term::ANSIColor
           color-severity-medium =                           #no coloring
           color-severity-low =                              #no coloring
           color-severity-lowest =                           #no coloring
           program-extensions =                              #Space-delimited list

       The remainder of the configuration file is a series of blocks like this:

           [Perl::Critic::Policy::Category::PolicyName]
           severity = 1
           set_themes = foo bar
           add_themes = baz
           arg1 = value1
           arg2 = value2

       "Perl::Critic::Policy::Category::PolicyName"  is  the  full  name of a module that implements the policy.
       The Policy modules distributed with Perl::Critic have been grouped into categories according to the table
       of  contents  in  Damian  Conway's  book  <b>Perl</b>  <b>Best</b>  <b>Practices</b>.  For   brevity,   you   can   omit   the
       'Perl::Critic::Policy' part of the module name.

       "severity"  is  the level of importance you wish to assign to the Policy.  All Policy modules are defined
       with a default severity value ranging from 1 (least  severe)  to  5  (most  severe).   However,  you  may
       disagree  with  the  default severity and choose to give it a higher or lower severity, based on your own
       coding philosophy.

       The remaining key-value pairs are configuration parameters that will be passed into  the  constructor  of
       that Policy.  The constructors for most Policy modules do not support arguments, and those that do should
       have reasonable defaults.  See the documentation on the appropriate Policy module for more details.

       Instead  of redefining the severity for a given Policy, you can completely disable a Policy by prepending
       a '-' to the name of the module in your configuration file.  In this manner, the  Policy  will  never  be
       loaded, regardless of the "-severity" given to the Perl::Critic::Config constructor.

       A simple configuration might look like this:

           #--------------------------------------------------------------
           # I think these are really important, so always load them

           [TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseStrict]
           severity = 5

           [TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseWarnings]
           severity = 5

           #--------------------------------------------------------------
           # I think these are less important, so only load when asked

           [Variables::ProhibitPackageVars]
           severity = 2

           [ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls]
           allow = if unless  #My custom configuration
           severity = 2

           #--------------------------------------------------------------
           # Give these policies a custom theme.  I can activate just
           # these policies by saying (-theme =&gt; 'larry + curly')

           [Modules::RequireFilenameMatchesPackage]
           add_themes = larry

           [TestingAndDebugging::RequireTestLabels]
           add_themes = curly moe

           #--------------------------------------------------------------
           # I do not agree with these at all, so never load them

           [-NamingConventions::Capitalization]
           [-ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitMagicNumbers]

           #--------------------------------------------------------------
           # For all other Policies, I accept the default severity, theme
           # and other parameters, so no additional configuration is
           # required for them.

       For  additional  configuration  examples,  see  the <u>perlcriticrc</u> file that is included in this <u>t/examples</u>
       directory of this distribution.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>POLICIES</b></h4><pre>
       A large number of Policy modules are distributed with Perl::Critic.  They are described  briefly  in  the
       companion document Perl::Critic::PolicySummary and in more detail in the individual modules themselves.

</pre><h4><b>POLICY</b> <b>THEMES</b></h4><pre>
       Each  Policy  is  defined  with  one  or more "themes".  Themes can be used to create arbitrary groups of
       Policies.  They are intended to provide an alternative mechanism for  selecting  your  preferred  set  of
       Policies.   For  example, you may wish disable a certain subset of Policies when analyzing test programs.
       Conversely, you may wish to enable only a specific subset of Policies when analyzing modules.

       The Policies that ship with Perl::Critic are have been broken into the following themes.   This  is  just
       our  attempt  to  provide some basic logical groupings.  You are free to invent new themes that suit your
       needs.

           THEME             DESCRIPTION
           --------------------------------------------------------------------------
           core              All policies that ship with Perl::Critic
           pbp               Policies that come directly from "Perl Best Practices"
           bugs              Policies that prevent or reveal bugs
           maintenance       Policies that affect the long-term health of the code
           cosmetic          Policies that only have a superficial effect
           complexity        Policies that specifically relate to code complexity
           security          Policies that relate to security issues
           tests             Policies that are specific to test programs

       Say `perlcritic -list` to get a listing of all available policies and the themes that are associated with
       each one.  You can  also  change  the  theme  for  any  Policy  in  your  <u>.perlcriticrc</u>  file.   See  the
       "CONFIGURATION" section for more information about that.

       Using  the "-theme" option, you can combine theme names with mathematical and boolean operators to create
       an arbitrarily complex expression that represents a custom "set" of Policies.   The  following  operators
       are supported

          Operator       Alternative         Meaning
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
          *              and                 Intersection
          -              not                 Difference
          +              or                  Union

       Operator  precedence  is the same as that of normal mathematics.  You can also use parenthesis to enforce
       precedence.  Here are some examples:

          Expression                  Meaning
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
          pbp * bugs                  All policies that are "pbp" AND "bugs"
          pbp and bugs                Ditto

          bugs + cosmetic             All policies that are "bugs" OR "cosmetic"
          bugs or cosmetic            Ditto

          pbp - cosmetic              All policies that are "pbp" BUT NOT "cosmetic"
          pbp not cosmetic            Ditto

          -maintenance                All policies that are NOT "maintenance"
          not maintenance             Ditto

          (pbp - bugs) * complexity     All policies that are "pbp" BUT NOT "bugs",
                                           AND "complexity"
          (pbp not bugs) and complexity  Ditto

       Theme names are case-insensitive.  If "-theme" is set to an empty string, then it is  equivalent  to  the
       set  of  all  Policies.   A  theme  name  that  doesn't  exist is equivalent to an empty set.  Please See
       &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set</a>&gt; for a discussion on set theory.
