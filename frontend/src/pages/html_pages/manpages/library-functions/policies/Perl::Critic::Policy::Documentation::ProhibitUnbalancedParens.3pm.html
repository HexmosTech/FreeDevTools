       Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::ProhibitUnbalancedParens - don't leave an open bracket or paren

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy is part of the "Perl::Critic::Pulp" add-on.  It reports unbalanced or mismatched parentheses,
       brackets and braces in POD text paragraphs,

           Blah blah (and something.    # bad

           Blah blah ( [ ).             # bad

           Blah blah brace }.           # bad

       This is only cosmetic and normally only a minor irritant to readability so this policy is low severity
       and under the "cosmetic" theme (see "POLICY THEMES" in Perl::Critic).

       Text and command paragraphs are checked, but verbatim paragraphs can have anything.  There are some
       exceptions to paren balancing.  The intention is to be forgiving of common or reasonable constructs.
       Currently this means,

       •   Anything in "C&lt;&gt;" code markup is ignored

               In code C&lt;anything [ is allowed&gt;.  # ok

           Perhaps  this  will  change,  though  there'd  have  to be extra exceptions in "C&lt;&gt;", such as various
           backslashing.

           Sometimes a prematurely ending "C&lt;&gt;" may look like an unbalanced paren, for example

               Call C&lt;foo(key=&gt;value)&gt; ...    # bad

           This is bad because the "C&lt;&gt;" ends at the "=&gt;", leaving "value)" unbalanced plain text.  This  is  an
           easy mistake to make.  (The author's "perl-pod-gt.el" can show warning face on this in Emacs.)

       •   Quoted "(" is taken to be describing the char and is not an open or close.

               Any of "(" or '[' or "[{]".   # ok

           This only applies to quoted parens alone (one or more), not larger quoted text.

       •   Item parens

               a) the first thing, or b) the second thing   # ok

               1) one, 2) two     # ok

           Exactly  how much is recognised as an "a)" etc is not quite settled.  In the current code a "1.5)" is
           recognised at the start of a paragraph, but in the middle only "1)" style.

       •   Smiley faces are an "optional" close,

               (Some thing :-).                # ok

               Bare smiley :).                 # ok

               (Or smile :-) and also close.)  # ok

       •   Sad smiley faces are not an opening paren,

               :( :-(.     # ok

       •   Perl variables $( and $[ are not opening parens,

               Default is group $( blah blah.  # ok

           ${ brace is still an open and expected to have a matching close, because it's likely to be a deref or
           delimiter,

               Deref with ${foo()} etc etc.

           Variables or expressions like this will often be in "C&lt;&gt;" markup and skipped for that reason instead,
           as described above.

       •   $) and $] are optional closes, since they might be Perl variables to skip, or might be "$" at the end
           of a parens,

              blah blah (which in TeX is $1\cdot2$).

           Perhaps the conditions for these will be restricted a bit, though again "C&lt;&gt;"  markup  around  sample
           code like this will be usual.

       •   "L&lt;display|link&gt;" links are processed as the "display" text part.  The link target (POD document name
           and section) can have anything.

       "=begin  :foo"  ... "=end :foo" sections with a format name ":foo" starting with a ":" are POD markup and
       are processed accordingly.  Other "=begin" sections are skipped.

   <b>Unrecognised</b> <b>Forms</b>
       A mathematical half-open range like the following is not recognised.

           [1,2)             # bad, currently

       Perhaps just numbers like this would be unambiguous,  but  if  it's  an  expression  then  it's  hard  to
       distinguish  a  parens typo from some mathematics.  The suggestion for now is an "=for" per below to flag
       it as an exception.  Another way would be to write 1 &lt;= X &lt; 2, which might be clearer  to  mathematically
       unsophisticated readers.

       Parens spanning multiple paragraphs are not recognised,

           (This is some     # bad

           thing.)           # bad

       Hopefully this is uncommon, and probably better style not to be parenthetical about something so big that
       it runs to multiple paragraphs or has a verbatim block in the middle etc.

   <b>Disabling</b>
       If an unbalanced paren is intended you can add an "=for" to tell "ProhibitUnbalancedParens" to allow it.

           =for ProhibitUnbalancedParens allow next

           Something ( deliberately unclosed.

       Or with a count of paragraphs to ignore,

           =for ProhibitUnbalancedParens allow next 2

           First deliberate [ unclosed.

           Second (.

       The usual no critic

           ## no critic (ProhibitUnbalancedParens)

       works  too as a whole-file disable, but the annotation must be before any "__END__" token, and if the POD
       is after the "__END__" then "Perl::Critic" 1.112 up is required.  Individual "=for" has the advantage  of
       being with an exception.

       As  always if you don't care about this at all you can disable "ProhibitUnbalancedParens" completely from
       your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> in the usual way (see "CONFIGURATION" in Perl::Critic),
