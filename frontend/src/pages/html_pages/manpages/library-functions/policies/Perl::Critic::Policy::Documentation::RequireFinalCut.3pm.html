       Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::RequireFinalCut - end POD with =cut directive

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy is part of the "Perl::Critic::Pulp" add-on.  It asks you to end POD with a "=cut" directive
       at the end of a file.

           =head1 DOCO

           Some text.

           =cut             # ok

       The idea is to have a definite end indication for human readers.  Perl and the POD processors don't
       require a final "=cut".  On that basis this policy is lowest severity and under the "cosmetic" theme (see
       "POLICY THEMES" in Perl::Critic).

       If there's no POD in the file then a "=cut" is not required.  Or if the file ends with code rather than
       POD then a "=cut" after that code is not required.

           =head2 About foo

           =cut

           sub foo {
           }              # ok, file ends with code not POD

       If there's POD at end of file but consists only of "=begin/=end" blocks then a "=cut" is not required.
       It's reckoned the "=end" is enough in this case.

           =begin wikidoc

           Entire document in wiki style.

           =end wikidoc          # ok, =cut not required

       If the file ends with a mixture of ordinary POD and "=begin" blocks then a is still required.  The
       special allowance is when only "=begin" blocks, presumably destined for some other markup system.

   <b>Blank</b> <b>Line</b>
       Generally a "=cut" should have a blank line before it, the same as other POD commands.  But Perl
       execution doesn't enforce that and the same looseness is permitted here,

           =pod

           Blah blah blah
           =cut                  # ok without preceding newline

       A check for blanks around POD commands is left to other policies.  The "podchecker" program reports this
       (Pod::Checker).

   <b>Disabling</b>
       If you don't care about a final "=cut" you can disable "RequireFinalCut" from your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> in the
       usual way (see "CONFIGURATION" in Perl::Critic),

           [-Documentation::RequireFinalCut]
