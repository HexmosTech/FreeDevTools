</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy - Base class for all Policy modules.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy is the abstract base class for all Policy objects.  If you're developing your own
       Policies, your job is to implement and override its methods in a subclass.  To work with the Perl::Critic
       engine, your implementation must behave as described below.  For a detailed explanation on how to make
       new Policy modules, please see the Perl::Critic::DEVELOPER document included in this distribution.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       This is considered to be a public class.  Any changes to its interface will go through a deprecation
       cycle.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new( ... )
           Don't  call this.  As a Policy author, do not implement this.  Use the initialize_if_enabled() method
           for your Policy setup.  See the developer documentation for more.

       initialize_if_enabled( $config )
           This receives an instance of Perl::Critic::PolicyConfig as a parameter, and is only invoked  if  this
           Policy  is  enabled  by  the  user.   Thus,  this  is  the  preferred  place for subclasses to do any
           initialization.

           Implementations of this method should return a boolean value indicating  whether  the  Policy  should
           continue  to  be enabled.  For most subclasses, this will always be $TRUE.  Policies that depend upon
           external modules or other system facilities that may or may not be  available  should  test  for  the
           availability of these dependencies and return $FALSE if they are not.

       prepare_to_scan_document( $document )
           The  parameter  is  about to be scanned by this Policy.  Whatever this Policy wants to do in terms of
           preparation should happen here.  Returns a boolean value indicating whether the  document  should  be
           scanned  at all; if this is a false value, this Policy won't be applied to the document.  By default,
           does nothing but return $TRUE.

       " violates( $element, $document ) "
           Given a PPI::Element and a PPI::Document, returns one or more Perl::Critic::Violation objects if  the
           $element  violates  this  Policy.  If there are no violations, then it returns an empty list.  If the
           Policy encounters an exception, then it should "croak" with an  error  message  and  let  the  caller
           decide how to handle it.

           violates()  is  an abstract method and it will abort if you attempt to invoke it directly.  It is the
           heart of all Policy modules, and your subclass <b>must</b> override this method.

       " violation( $description, $explanation, $element ) "
           Returns a reference to a new "Perl::Critic::Violation" object. The arguments are a description of the
           violation (as string), an explanation for the policy (as string) or a series of page numbers  in  PBP
           (as an ARRAY ref), a reference to the PPI element that caused the violation.

           These  are  the  same  as  the constructor to Perl::Critic::Violation, but without the severity.  The
           Policy itself knows the severity.

       " new_parameter_value_exception( $option_name, $option_value, $source, $message_suffix ) "
           Create a Perl::Critic::Exception::Configuration::Option::Policy::ParameterValue for this Policy.

       " throw_parameter_value_exception( $option_name, $option_value, $source, $message_suffix ) "
           Create and throw a Perl::Critic::Exception::Configuration::Option::Policy::ParameterValue.  Useful in
           parameter parser implementations.

        get_long_name()
           Return the full package name of this policy.

        get_short_name()
           Return the name of this policy without the "Perl::Critic::Policy::" prefix.

        is_enabled()
           Answer whether this policy is really active or not.  Returns a true value if  it  is,  a  false,  yet
           defined, value if it isn't, and an undefined value if it hasn't yet been decided whether it will be.

        applies_to()
           Returns  a  list of the names of PPI classes that this Policy cares about.  By default, the result is
           "PPI::Element".  Overriding this method in Policy subclasses should lead to  significant  performance
           increases.

        default_maximum_violations_per_document()
           Returns the default maximum number of violations for this policy to report per document.  By default,
           this not defined, but subclasses may override this.

        get_maximum_violations_per_document()
           Returns  the  maximum number of violations this policy will report for a single document.  If this is
           not defined, then there  is  no  limit.   If  "<b>set_maximum_violations_per_document()</b>"  has  not  been
           invoked, then "<b>default_maximum_violations_per_document()</b>" is returned.

        set_maximum_violations_per_document()
           Specify the maximum violations that this policy should report for a document.

        default_severity()
           Returns   the   default  severity  for  violating  this  Policy.   See  the  $SEVERITY  constants  in
           Perl::Critic::Utils for an enumeration of possible severity values.  By default, this method  returns
           $SEVERITY_LOWEST.  Authors of Perl::Critic::Policy subclasses should override this method to return a
           value  that  they feel is appropriate for their Policy.  In general, Polices that are widely accepted
           or tend to prevent bugs should have a higher severity than those that are more subjective or cosmetic
           in nature.

        get_severity()
           Returns the severity of violating this Policy.  If the severity has not been  explicitly  defined  by
           calling  "set_severity",  then  the  "default_severity"  is returned.  See the $SEVERITY constants in
           Perl::Critic::Utils for an enumeration of possible severity values.

        set_severity( $N )
           Sets the severity for violating this Policy.  Clients of Perl::Critic::Policy objects can  call  this
           method  to assign a different severity to the Policy if they don't agree with the "default_severity".
           See the $SEVERITY constants in Perl::Critic::Utils for an enumeration of possible values.

        default_themes()
           Returns a sorted list of the default themes associated with this Policy.  The default method  returns
           an  empty  list.   Policy  authors  should  override  this method to return a list of themes that are
           appropriate for their policy.

        get_themes()
           Returns a sorted list of the themes associated with this Policy.  If you haven't added themes or  set
           the themes explicitly, this method just returns the default themes.

        set_themes( @THEME_LIST )
           Sets  the themes associated with this Policy.  Any existing themes are overwritten.  Duplicate themes
           will be removed.

        add_themes( @THEME_LIST )
           Appends additional themes to this Policy.  Any existing themes are preserved.  Duplicate themes  will
           be removed.

        get_abstract()
           Retrieve  the  abstract  for  this  policy  (the part of the NAME section of the POD after the module
           name), if it is available.

        get_raw_abstract()
           Retrieve the abstract for this policy (the part of the NAME section  of  the  POD  after  the  module
           name), if it is available, in the unparsed form.

        parameter_metadata_available()
           Returns whether information about the parameters is available.

        get_parameters()
           Returns a reference to an array containing instances of Perl::Critic::PolicyParameter.

           Note  that this will return an empty list if the parameters for this policy are unknown.  In order to
           differentiate between this circumstance and the one where this policy does not take  any  parameters,
           it is necessary to call parameter_metadata_available().

       set_format( $format )
           Class method.  Sets the format for all Policy objects when they are evaluated in string context.  The
           default is "%p\n".  See "OVERLOADS" for formatting options.

       get_format()
           Class  method.  Returns  the  current format for all Policy objects when they are evaluated in string
           context.

       to_string()
           Returns a string representation of the policy.  The content of the  string  depends  on  the  current
           value returned by get_format().  See "OVERLOADS" for the details.

       is_safe()
           Answer  whether  this  Policy can be used to analyze untrusted code, i.e. the Policy doesn't have any
           potential side effects.

           This method returns a true value by default.

           An "unsafe" policy might attempt to compile the code, which, if you have "BEGIN"  or  "CHECK"  blocks
           that  affect  files  or connect to databases, is not a safe thing to do.  If you are writing a such a
           Policy, then you should override this method to return false.

           By default Perl::Critic will not run unsafe policies.

</pre><h4><b>DOCUMENTATION</b></h4><pre>
       When your Policy module first "use"s Perl::Critic::Violation, it will try  and  extract  the  DESCRIPTION
       section  of  your  Policy  module's  POD.  This information is displayed by Perl::Critic if the verbosity
       level is set accordingly.  Therefore, please include a DESCRIPTION section in  the  POD  for  any  Policy
       modules that you author.  Thanks.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLOADS</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Violation  overloads  the  ""  operator  to  produce neat little messages when evaluated in
       string context.

       Formats are a combination of literal and escape characters similar to the way "sprintf"  works.   If  you
       want to know the specific formatting capabilities, look at String::Format. Valid escape characters are:

       %P  Name of the Policy module.

       %p  Name of the Policy without the "Perl::Critic::Policy::" prefix.

       %a  The policy abstract.

       %O  List of supported policy parameters.  Takes an option of a format string for "to_formatted_string" in
           Perl::Critic::PolicyParameter.   For  example, this can be used like "%{%n - %d\n}O" to get a list of
           parameter names followed by their descriptions.

       %U  A message stating that the parameters for the policy are  unknown  if  parameter_metadata_available()
           returns  false.   Takes  an  option  of  what  the  message  should  be,  which  defaults  to "Cannot
           programmatically discover what  parameters  this  policy  takes.".   The  value  of  this  option  is
           interpolated in order to expand the standard escape sequences ("\n", "\t", etc.).

       %S  The default severity level of the policy.

       %s  The current severity level of the policy.

       %T  The default themes for the policy.

       %t  The current themes for the policy.

       %V  The default maximum number of violations per document of the policy.

       %v  The current maximum number of violations per document of the policy.
