</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::Policy - Site policy for file I/O functions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use File::Policy;
               use File::Policy qw/check_safe/;   # to import a specific subroutine
               use File::Policy qw/:all/;         # to import all subroutines

               #Checking I/O policy
               check_safe($filename, 'r');
               check_safe($filename, 'w');

               #Preferred directory locations
               $logdir = get_log_dir();
               $tmpdir = get_temp_dir();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This defines the policy for file I/O with modules such as File::Slurp::WithinPolicy.  The purpose is to
       allow systems administrators to define locations and restrictions for applications' file I/O and give app
       developers a policy to follow.  Note that the module doesn't ENFORCE the policy - application developers
       can choose to ignore it (and systems administrators can choose not to install their applications if they
       do!).

       You may control which policy gets applied by creating a File::Policy::Config module with an
       IMPLEMENTATION constant. You may write your own policy as a module within the File::Policy:: namespace.

       By default (if no File::Policy::Config is present), the File::Policy::Default policy gets applied which
       doesn't impose any restrictions and provides reasonable default locations for temporary and log files.

       The motivation behind this module was a standard, flexible approach to allow a site wide file policy to
       be defined.  This will be most useful in large environments where a few sysadmins are responsible for
       code written by many other people.  Simply ensuring that submitted code calls <b>check_safe()</b> ensures file
       access is sane, reducing the amount of effort required to do a security audit.

       If your code is not security audit'd, or you are the only developer at your site, this might be overkill.
       However you may consider it good practise regardless and protection against paths in your code getting
       corrupted accidentally or maliciously in the future.

       There are two major benefits of using this module.  One, sites that do implement a policy can more easily
       integrate your code in a standard way.  If you have a file policy at your site, you can apply different
       policies (via File::Policy::Config) in different environments (production, integration test, development)
       and the appropriate policy is automatically applied without having to change your code or configs.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       check_safe
                   check_safe( FILENAME , MODE );

           Checks FILENAME is safe - dies if not.  MODE is r (read) or w (write).

       get_temp_dir
                   $temporary_directory = get_temp_dir();

           Returns  the  path  to  temporary  directory.  Note that any return value will have been cleared of a
           trailing slash.

       get_log_dir
                   $log_directory = get_log_dir();

           Returns the path to log directory.  Note that any return value will have been cleared of  a  trailing
           slash.

</pre><h4><b>DEFINING</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>OWN</b> <b>POLICY</b></h4><pre>
       To implement your own custom policy

         cp File/Policy/Default.pm File/Policy/YourPolicy.pm

       and modify YourPolicy accordingly.  Then, create File/Policy/Config.pm containing:

         use constant IMPLEMENTATION =&gt; 'YourPolicy';

       Now  having  used  File::Policy,  calling check_safe in your scripts will enforce your policy (as well as
       give you access to log and temp paths in locations you recommend).
