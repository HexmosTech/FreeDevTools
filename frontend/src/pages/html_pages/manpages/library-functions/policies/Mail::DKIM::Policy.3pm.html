</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mail::DKIM::Policy - abstract base class for originator "signing" policies

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.20230212

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # get all policies that apply to a verified message
         foreach my $policy ($dkim-&gt;policies)
         {

             # the name of this policy
             my $name = $policy-&gt;name;

             # the location in DNS where this policy was found
             my $location = $policy-&gt;location;

             # apply this policy to the message being verified
             my $result = $policy-&gt;apply($dkim);

         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Between the various versions of the DomainKeys/DKIM standards, several different forms of sender
       "signing" policies have been defined.  In order for the Mail::DKIM library to support these different
       policies, it uses several different subclasses. All subclasses support this general interface, so that a
       program using Mail::DKIM can support any and all policies found for a message.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       These methods are supported by all classes implementing the Mail::DKIM::Policy interface.

   <b>apply()</b>
       Apply the policy to the results of a DKIM verifier.

         my $result = $policy-&gt;apply($dkim_verifier);

       The caller must provide an instance of Mail::DKIM::Verifier, one which has already been fed the message
       being verified.

       Possible results are:

       accept
           The message is approved by the sender signing policy.

       reject
           The message is rejected by the sender signing policy.

       neutral
           The  message  is  neither  approved  nor  rejected by the sender signing policy. It can be considered
           suspicious.

   <b>as_string()</b>
       The policy as a string.

       Note that the string returned by this method will not necessarily have the tags ordered the same  as  the
       text record found in DNS.

   <b>is_implied_default_policy()</b>
       Is this policy implied?

         my $is_implied = $policy-&gt;is_implied_default_policy;

       If  you  fetch the policy for a particular domain, but that domain does not have a policy published, then
       the "default policy" is in effect. Use this method to detect when that happens.

   <b>location()</b>
       Where the policy was fetched from.

       This is generally a domain name, the domain name where the policy was published.

       If nothing is published for the domain, and the default policy was returned instead, the location will be
       "undef".

   <b>name()</b>
       Identify what type of policy this is.

       This currently returns strings like "sender", "author", and "ADSP".  It is subject to change in the  next
       version of Mail::DKIM.
