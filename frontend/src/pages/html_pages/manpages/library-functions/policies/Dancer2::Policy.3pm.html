</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer2::Policy - Dancer core and community policy and standards of conduct

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.1.2

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes various policies (most notably, the standards of conduct) for the Dancer core
       developers and broad community.

       This is what we expect from our community and ourselves and these are the standards of behavior we set
       forth in order to make sure the community remains a safe space for all of its members, without exception.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b> <b>OF</b> <b>CONDUCT</b></h4><pre>
       These standards apply anywhere the community comes together as a group.  This includes, but is not
       limited to, the Dancer IRC channel, the Dancer mailing list, Dancer hackathons, and Dancer conferences.

       •   Always be civil.

       •   Heed the moderators.

       •   Abuse is not tolerated.

       Civility  is simple: stick to the facts while avoiding demeaning remarks and sarcasm. It is not enough to
       be factual. You must also be civil. Responding in kind to incivility is not acceptable.

       If the list moderators tell you that you are not being civil, carefully  consider  how  your  words  have
       appeared  before responding in any way. You may protest, but repeated protest in the face of a repeatedly
       reaffirmed decision is not acceptable.

       Unacceptable behavior will result in a public and  clearly  identified  warning.   Repeated  unacceptable
       behavior will result in removal from the mailing list and revocation of any commit bit. The first removal
       is  for  one month. Subsequent removals will double in length. After six months with no warning, a user's
       ban length is reset. Removals, like warnings, are public.

       The list of moderators consists of all active core developers.  This  includes,  in  alphabetical  order,
       Alberto  Simões, David Precious, Jason Crome, Mickey Nasriachi, Peter Mottram, Russell Jenkins, Sawyer X,
       Stefan Hornburg (Racke), and Yanick Champoux.

       This list might additionally grow to active members of the community who have stepped up to  help  handle
       abusive behavior. If this should happen, this document would be updated to include their names.

       Additionally,  it's important to understand the self-regulating nature we foster at the Dancer community.
       This means anyone and everyone in the community - in the channel, on the list, at  an  event  -  has  the
       ability to call out unacceptable behavior and incivility to others in the community.

       Moderators  are  responsible  for issuing warnings and take disciplinary actions, but anyone may - and is
       encouraged - to publicly make note of unacceptable treatment of others.

       As a core principle, abuse is never tolerated. One cannot berate, insult, debase, deride,  put  down,  or
       vilify anyone, or act towards anyone in a way intending to hurt them.

       The  community  specifically  considers  as  abuse  any  attempts  to  otherize  anyone by any individual
       characteristic, including, but not limited to, their technical skill, knowledge or by their age,  colour,
       disability, gender, language, national or social origin, political or other opinion, race, religion, sex,
       or sexual orientation.

       The community aims to maintain a safe space for everyone, in any forum it has. If you ever feel this core
       principle has been compromised, you are strongly urged to contact a moderator. We are always here.

       Remember, this is <b>your</b> community, as much as it is anyone else's.
