</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Theme - Construct thematic sets of policies.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a helper class for evaluating theme expressions into sets of Policy objects.  There are no user-
       serviceable parts here.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       This is considered to be a non-public class.  Its interface is subject to change without notice.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "new( -rule =&gt; $rule_expression )"
           Returns  a  reference  to  a  new  Perl::Critic::Theme  object.   "-rule" is a string expression that
           evaluates to true or false for each Policy..  See "THEME RULES" for more information.

       "policy_is_thematic( -policy =&gt; $policy )"
           Given a reference to a Perl::Critic::Policy object, this method returns evaluates  the  rule  against
           the  themes  that  are  associated  with  the  Policy.  Returns 1 if the Policy satisfies the rule, 0
           otherwise.

        rule()
           Returns the rule expression that was used to construct this Theme.  The rule may have been translated
           into a normalized expression.  See "THEME RULES" for more information.

   <b>THEME</b> <b>RULES</b>
       A theme rule is a simple boolean expression, where the operands are  the  names  of  any  of  the  themes
       associated with the Perl::Critic::Polices.

       Theme  names  can be combined with logical operators to form arbitrarily complex expressions.  Precedence
       is the same as normal mathematics, but you can use parentheses to enforce precedence as well.   Supported
       operators are:

          Operator    Altertative    Example
          ----------------------------------------------------------------
          &amp;&amp;          and            'pbp &amp;&amp; core'
          ||          or             'pbp || (bugs &amp;&amp; security)'
          !           not            'pbp &amp;&amp; ! (portability || complexity)

       See "CONFIGURATION" in Perl::Critic for more information about customizing the themes for each Policy.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       cook_rule( $rule )
           Standardize  a  rule  into  almost executable Perl code.  The "almost" comes from the fact that theme
           names are left as is.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTANTS</b></h4><pre>
       $RULE_INVALID_CHARACTER_REGEX
           A regular expression that will return the first character in the matched expression that is not valid
           in a rule.
