       using_tools - Using the GNU tools

       This is a short summary of the AVR-specific aspects of using the GNU tools. Normally, the generic
       documentation of these tools is fairly large and maintained in texinfo files. Command-line options are
       explained in detail in the manual page.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> <b>compiler</b> <b>avr-gcc</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Machine-specific</b> <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>AVR</b>
       The following machine-specific options are recognized by the C compiler frontend. The preprocessor will
       define the macros __AVR and __AVR__ (to the value 1) when compiling for an AVR target. The macro AVR will
       be defined as well, except in strict ANSI mode.

       There are many options supported by avr-gcc, which also depend on the compiler version. For a complete
       overview, please see the documentation of avr-gcc's command line options. Here are links to supported
       options of the respective release series:

       • Current development (work in progress)

       • v14

       • v13.2, v13.3

       • v12.3, v12.4

       • v11

       • v10

       • v9

       • v8

       • v7

       • v6

       • v5

       • v4.9

       • v4.8

       • v4.7

       Apart from the documentation of command line options, the linked pages also contain:

       • The  documentation  of built-in macros like __AVR_ARCH__, __AVR_ATmega328P__ and __AVR_HAVE_MUL__, just
         to mention a few.

       • How the compiler treats the RAMPX, RAMPY, RAMPZ and RAMPD special function registers  on  devices  that
         have (one of) them.

       • How the compiler treats the EIND special function register on devices with more than 128 KiB of program
         memory, and how indirect calls are realized on such devices.

       <b>-mmcu=</b><u>arch</u>

       <b>-mmcu=</b><u>mcu</u>
           Compile code for architecture <u>arch</u> <u>resp.</u> <u>AVR</u> <u>device</u> <u>mcu.</u>

       Since  GCC  v5,  the compiler no more supports indivitual devices, instead the compiler comes with device
       specs files that describe which options to use  with  each  sub-processes  like  pre-processor,  compiler
       proper, assembler and linker.

       The  purpose  of  these  specs  files  is  to  add support for AVR devices that the compiler does not yet
       support.

       The easiest way to add support for an unsupported device is to use device support from an atpack  archive
       as  provided  by  the  hardware  manufacturer. Apart from the <u>mcu</u> <u>specific</u> <u>specs</u> <u>file,</u> <u>it</u> <u>provides</u> <u>device</u>
       <u>headers</u> <u>io*.h,</u> <u>startup</u> <u>code</u> <u>crtmcu.o</u> <u>and</u> <u>device</u> <u>library</u> <u>libmcu.a.</u>

   <b>Selected</b> <b>general</b> <b>compiler</b> <b>options</b>
       The following general gcc options might be of some interest to AVR users.

       <b>-O</b><u>n</u>
           Optimization level <u>n</u>. Increasing <u>n</u> is meant to optimize more.

       <b>-O0</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>compilation</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>debugging</b> <b>produce</b> <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> <b>results.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>default.</b>
        <b>Turning</b> <b>off</b> <b>all</b> <b>optimizations</b> <b>will</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>some</b> <b>warnings</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>issued</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b>
       <b>warnings</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>code</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>steps</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>performed</b> <b>when</b> <b>optimizing</b> <b>(unreachable</b> <b>code,</b> <b>unused</b>
       <b>variables).</b> <b>Moreover,</b> <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> <b>routines</b> <b>in</b> <b>&lt;util/delay.h&gt;</b> <b>require</b> <b>optimization</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on.</b>

       <b>-O2</b> <b>optimizes</b> <b>for</b> <b>speed,</b> <b>but</b> <b>without</b> <b>enabling</b> <b>very</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>optimizations</b> <b>like</b> <b>-O3</b> <b>does.</b>

       <b>-Os</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>-O2</b> <b>optimizations</b> <b>except</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>often</b> <b>increase</b> <b>code</b> <b>size.</b> <b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b>
       <b>preferred</b> <b>optimization</b> <b>level</b> <b>for</b> <b>AVR</b> <b>programs.</b>

       <b>-Og</b> <b>optimizes</b> <b>debugging</b> <b>experience.</b> <b>This</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>optimization</b> <b>level</b>  <b>of</b>  <b>choice</b>  <b>for</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>standard</b>
       <b>edit-compile-debug</b>  <b>cycle,</b> <b>offering</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>optimization</b> <b>while</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>fast</b> <b>compilation</b>
       <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>debugging</b> <b>experience.</b>

       <b>-O3</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>inline</b> <b>all</b> <b>'simple'</b> <b>functions</b> <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>unroll</b> <b>some</b> <b>loops.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>AVR</b> <b>target,</b> <b>this</b>  <b>will</b>
       <b>normally</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>pessimization</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>code</b> <b>increasement.</b>

       <b>-O</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>equivalent</b>  <b>to</b> <b>-O1.</b> <b>The</b> <b>compiler</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>code</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>execution</b> <b>time,</b> <b>without</b> <b>performing</b>
       <b>any</b> <b>optimizations</b> <b>that</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>compilation</b> <b>time.</b>

       See also the <b>appropriate</b> <b>FAQ</b> <b>entry</b> for issues regarding debugging optimized code.

       <b>-Wp,</b><u>preprocessor-options</u>

       <b>-Wa,</b><u>assembler-options</u>

       <b>-Wl,</b><u>linker-options</u>
           Pass the listed options to the C preprocessor, the assembler or  the  linker,  respectively.  Several
           options can be passed at once when they are separated by a , (comma).

       <b>-g</b>  Generate debugging information that can be used by avr-gdb. GCC v12 changed the default from STABS to
           DWARF. Different DWARF levels can be selected by -g2 or -gdwarf-3.
            The compiler may use GNU extensions to the DWARF format. When a debugger has problems with that, try
           -gstrict-dwarf.

       <b>-x</b> <u>lang</u>

       <b>-x</b> <b>none</b>
           Compile the following files in language <u>lang</u>. Values for <u>lang</u> are: c, c++, assembler, assembler-with-
           cpp and none.

       For  example,  GCC does not recognize the .asm file extension as assembly source. With -x assembler-with-
       cpp file.asm, the compiler first runs the C preprocessor on file.asm (so that #include &lt;<b>avr/io.h</b>&gt; <b>can</b>  <b>be</b>
       <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>assembly),</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> <b>assembler.</b>

       Another  use  case is to compile a C file that's read from standard input, which is specified as - (dash)
       instead of the name of a source file. As no source file name is specified,  the  compiler  must  be  told
       which language to use: The command

       $ echo '#include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;' | avr-gcc -xc - -mmcu=atmega8 -E -dM | grep _VECTOR

        pre-processes  the  C file #include &lt;<b>avr/io.h</b>&gt; <b>and</b> <b>writes</b> <b>all</b> <b>macro</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>to</b> <b>stdout.</b> <b>The</b> <b>output</b> <b>is</b>
       <b>then</b> <b>filtered</b> <b>by</b> <b>grep</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>ISR</b> <b>vector</b> <b>names</b> <b>for</b> <b>ATmega8.</b>

       -x none returns to the default for the following inputs, i.e. infer the respective source languages  from
       the file extensions.

       <b>-save-temps</b>

       <b>-save-temps=obj</b>

       <b>-save-temps=cwd</b>

       <b>-fverbose-asm</b>

       <b>-dumpbase</b> <u>base</u>

       <b>-dumpdir</b> <u>dir</u>
           Don't  remove temporary, intermediate files like C preprocessor output and assembly code generated by
           the compiler. The intermediate files have file extension .i (preprocessed C), .ii (preprocessed  C++)
           and .s (preprocessed assembly, compiler-generated assembly).

       -dumpbase and -dumpdir can be used to adjust file names and locations.

       With  -fverbose-asm,  the  compiler  adds  the  high  level source code to the assembly output. Compiling
       without debugging information (-g0) improves legibility of the generated assembly.

       The preprocessed files can be used to check if macro expansions work as expected. With -g3 or higher, the
       preprocessed files will also contain all macro definitions and indications where they are defined: Built-
       in, on the command line, or in some header file as indicated by #line notes.

       <b>-l</b><u>name</u>
           Locate the archive library named lib<u>name</u>.a, and use it to resolve currently unresolved  symbols  from
           it.  The  library  is  searched along a path that consists of builtin pathname entries that have been
           specified at configure time (e. g. /usr/local/avr/lib on Unix systems), possibly extended by pathname
           entries as specified by -L options (that must precede the -l options on the command-line).

       <b>-L</b><u>path</u>
           Additional directory <u>path</u> to look for archive libraries requested by -l options.

       <b>-ffunction-sections</b>

       <b>-fdata-sections</b>
           Put each function resp. object in static storage  in  its  own  <b>input</b>  <b>section</b>.  This  is  used  with
           -Wl,--gc-sections  so  the linker can better garbage-collect unused sections, which are sections that
           are neither referenced by other sections, nor are marked as KEEP, nor  are  referenced  by  an  entry
           symbol.

       <b>-mrelax</b>
           Replace  JMP  and  CALL  instructions  with  the  faster  and  shorter RJMP and RCALL instructions if
           possible. That optimization is performed by the linker, and  the  assembler  must  not  resolve  some
           expressions, which is all arranged by -mrelax.

       <b>-Tbss</b> <u>org</u>

       <b>-Tdata</b> <u>org</u>

       <b>-Ttext</b> <u>org</u>
           Start the .bss, .data, or .text section at VMA address <u>org</u>, respectively.

       <b>-T</b> <u>scriptfile</u>
           Use <u>scriptfile</u> as the linker script, replacing or augmenting the default linker script.

       Default linker scripts are stored in a system-specific location (e. g. under /usr/local/avr/lib/ldscripts
       on  Unix  systems),  and consist of the AVR architecture name (avr2 through avrxmega7) with the suffix .x
       appended. They describe how the various <b>memory</b> <b>sections</b> will be linked together and which input  sections
       go into them. Notice that the default linker scripts are part of the linker binary, changing them on file
       will have no effect.

       For a simple linker script augmentation, see the avr-gcc Wiki on named address spaces.

       <b>-nostdlib</b>
           Don't link against standard libraries.

       <b>-nodefaultlibs</b>
           Don't link against default libraries.

       <b>-nodevicelib</b>
           Don't link against AVR-LibC's lib<u>mcu</u>.a <u>that</u> <u>contains</u> <u>EEPROM</u> <u>support</u> <u>and</u> <u>other</u> <u>stuff.</u> <u>This</u> <u>can</u> <u>be</u> <u>used</u>
           <u>when</u> <u>no</u> <u>such</u> <u>library</u> <u>is</u> <u>available.</u>

       <b>-nostartfiles</b>
           Don't link against AVR-LibC's <b>startup</b> <b>code</b> crt<u>mcu</u>.o<u>.</u>

       Notice  that parts of the startup code are provided by libgcc.a. To get rid of that, one can -nostdlib or
       -nodefaultlibs; however that also removes other code like functions required for arithmetic. To just  get
       rid of the startup bits, define the respective symbols, for example
        -Wl,--defsym,__do_clear_bss=0 and similar for __do_copy_data, __do_global_ctors and __do_global_dtors.

       <b>-funsigned-char</b>
           This option changes the binary interface!
            Make any unqualfied char type an unsigned char. Without this option, they default to a signed char.

       <b>-funsigned-bitfields</b>
           This option changes the binary interface!
            Make any unqualified bitfield type unsigned. By default, they are signed.

       <b>-fshort-enums</b>
           This option changes the binary interface!
            Allocate  to  an enum type only as many bytes as it needs for the declared range of possible values.
           Specifically, the enum type will be equivalent to the smallest integer type which has enough room.

       <b>-fpack-struct</b>
           This option changes the binary interface!
            Pack all structure members together without holes.

       <b>-fno-jump-tables</b>
           Do not generate tablejump instructions. By default, jump  tables  can  be  used  to  optimize  switch
           statements.  When  turned  off,  sequences  of  compare  statements are used instead. Jump tables are
           usually faster to execute on average, but in particular for switch  statements,  where  most  of  the
           jumps would go to the default label, they might waste a bit of flash memory.

       Note:  Sinve  GCC  v4.9.2,  tablejump  code  uses the ELPM instruction to read from jump tables. In older
       version, use the -fno-jump-tables switch when compiling a bootloader for devices with more than 64 KiB of
       code memory.

       <b>-ffreestanding</b>
           Assume a 'freestanding' environment as per the C standard. This turns off automatic builtin functions
           (though they can still be reached by prepending __builtin_ to the  actual  function  name).  It  also
           makes  the  compiler  not  complain  when main() is declared with a void return type. (In most cases,
           main() won't even return anyway, and hence using a return type of int has no downsides at all).

       However, this option also turns off all optimizations normally done by the  compiler  which  assume  that
       functions known by a certain name behave as described by the standard. For example, applying the function
       strlen()  to  a  literal  string will normally cause the compiler to immediately replace that call by the
       actual length of the string, while with -ffreestanding, it will always call strlen() at run-time.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>assembler</b> <b>avr-as</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Note</b>
           The preferred way to assemble a file is by means of using avr-gcc:

           • avr-gcc, which is a driver program to call sub-programs like the compiler proper or the  assembler,
             knows which options it has to add to the assembler's command line, like: -mmcu=<u>arch,</u> <u>-mno-skip-bug,</u>
             <u>etc.</u>

           • avr-gcc will call the C preprocessor on the assembler input for sources with extensions .S and .sx.
             For other extensions, use

           $ avr-gcc -x assembler-with-cpp file.asm ...

            This allows to use C preprocessor directives like

           #include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;

            in assembly sources.

   <b>Machine-specific</b> <b>assembler</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-mmcu=</b><u>architecture</u>

       <b>-mmcu=</b><u>mcu</u>
           avr-as  does  not  support  all  <u>mcu</u>s  supported by the compiler. As explained in the note above, the
           preferred way to run the assembler is by using the compiler driver avr-gcc.

       <b>-mall-opcodes</b>
           Turns off opcode checking, and allows any possible AVR opcode to be assembled.

       <b>-mno-skip-bug</b>
           Don't emit a warning when trying  to  skip  a  2-word  instruction  with  a  CPSE/SBIC/SBIS/SBRC/SBRS
           instruction.  Early  AVR  devices  suffered from a hardware bug where these instructions could not be
           properly skipped.

       <b>-mno-wrap</b>
           For RJMP/RCALL instructions, don't allow the target address to wrap around for devices that have more
           than 8 KiB of memory.

       <b>--gstabs</b>
           Generate .stabs debugging symbols for assembler source lines. This enables avr-gdb to  trace  through
           assembler source files. This option <u>must</u> <u>not</u> be used when assembling sources that have been generated
           by  the  C  compiler;  these files already contain the appropriate line number information from the C
           source files.

       <b>-a[cdhlmns=</b><u>file</u><b>]</b>
           Turn on the assembler listing. The sub-options are:
       • c omit false conditionals
       • d omit debugging directives
       • h include high-level source
       • l include assembly
       • m include macro expansions
       • n omit forms processing
       • s include symbols
       • =<u>file</u> <u>set</u> <u>the</u> <u>name</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>listing</u> <u>file</u>
       The various sub-options can be combined into a single -a option list; <u>=file</u> must be the last one in  that
       case.
   <b>Examples</b> <b>for</b> <b>assembler</b> <b>options</b> <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> <b>compiler</b>
       Remember  that  assembler  options  can  be passed from the C compiler frontend using -Wa (see <b>gcc_minusW</b>
       above), so in order to include the C source code  into  the  assembler  listing  in  file  foo.lss,  when
       compiling foo.c, the following compiler command-line can be used:
       $ avr-gcc -mmcu=atmega8 -c foo.c -o foo.o -Wa,-ahls=foo.lss
       In order to pass an assembler file through the C preprocessor first, and have the assembler generate line
       number debugging information for it, the following command can be used:
       $ avr-gcc -c -x assembler-with-cpp -o foo.o foo.asm -Wa,--gstabs
       Note  that  on  Unix  systems that have case-distinguishing file systems, specifying a file name with the
       suffix .S (upper-case letter S) will make the compiler automatically assume -x assembler-with-cpp,  while
       using .s would pass the file directly to the assembler (no preprocessing done).
</pre><h4><b>Controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>linker</b> <b>avr-ld</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Note</b>
           It is highly recommended to use the compiler driver avr-gcc or avr-g++ for linking.
           • The driver knows which options to pass down to the linker. This includes the correct multilib path,
             support libraries like libc.a, libm.a, libgcc.a and lib<u>mcu</u>.a<u>,</u> <u>as</u> <u>well</u> <u>as</u> <u>options</u> <u>for</u> <u>LTO</u> <u>(link-time</u>
             <u>optimization)</u>  <u>and</u>  <u>options</u>  <u>for</u>  <u>plugins</u>  <u>(that</u>  <u>call</u> <u>back</u> <u>the</u> <u>compiler</u> <u>to</u> <u>compile</u> <u>LTO</u> <u>byte</u> <u>code),</u>
             <u>startup</u> <u>code</u> <u>and</u> <u>many</u> <u>more.</u>
           • The driver program understands options like -l<u>lib,</u> <u>-Lpath,</u> <u>Ttext,</u> <u>Tdata,</u> <u>Tbss</u> <u>and</u> <u>-T</u> <u>script,</u> <u>so</u>  <u>no</u>
             <u>-Wl</u> <u>is</u> <u>required</u> <u>for</u> <u>them.</u>
   <b>Selected</b> <b>linker</b> <b>options</b>
       A number of the standard options might be of interest to AVR users.
       <b>--defsym</b> <u>symbol=expr</u>
           Define a global symbol <u>symbol</u> using <u>expr</u> as the value.
       <b>-M</b>  Print a linker map to stdout.
       <b>-Map</b> <u>mapfile</u>
           Print a linker map to <u>mapfile</u>.
       <b>--cref</b>
           Output a cross reference table to the map file (in case -Map is also present), or to stdout.
       <b>--gc-sections</b>
           Only  keep  input  sections that are referenced (by other sections or the entry symbol), and that are
           not marked as KEEP in the linker script. This is used to reduce  code  size,  usually  together  with
           compiler  option  -ffunction-sections  so  that input section granularity is on function level rather
           than on the level of compilation units.
       <b>--section-start</b> <u>sectionname=org</u>
           Start section <u>sectionname</u> at absolute address <u>org</u>.
       <b>--relax</b>
           Don't use this option directly or per -Wl,--relax. Instead, link with avr-gcc ... -mrelax.
   <b>Passing</b> <b>linker</b> <b>options</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>C</b> <b>compiler</b>
       By default, all unknown non-option arguments on the avr-gcc command-line (i. e., all  filename  arguments
       that  don't  have a suffix that is handled by avr-gcc) are passed straight to the linker. Thus, all files
       ending in .o (object files) and .a (object libraries) are provided to the linker.
       System libraries are usually not passed by their explicit filename but rather using the -l  option  which
       uses  an  abbreviated  form of the archive filename (see above). AVR-LibC ships system libraries, libc.a,
       libm.a and lib<u>mcu</u>.a<u>.</u> <u>While</u> <u>the</u> <u>standard</u> <u>library</u> <u>libc.a</u> <u>will</u> <u>always</u> <u>be</u> <u>searched</u> <u>for</u> <u>unresolved</u>  <u>references</u>
       <u>when</u>  <u>the</u> <u>linker</u> <u>is</u> <u>started</u> <u>using</u> <u>the</u> <u>C</u> <u>compiler</u> <u>frontend</u> <u>(i.</u> <u>e.,</u> <u>there's</u> <u>always</u> <u>at</u> <u>least</u> <u>one</u> <u>implied</u> <u>-lc</u>

       Conventionally,  Makefiles  use  the make macro LDLIBS to keep track of -l (and possibly -L) options that
       should only be appended to the C compiler command-line when linking the final binary.  In  contrast,  the
       macro  LDFLAGS  is  used  to  store other command-line options to the C compiler that should be passed as
       options during the linking stage. The difference is that options are placed early  on  the  command-line,
       while  libraries  are  put  at the end since they are to be used to resolve global symbols that are still
       unresolved at this point.
       Specific linker flags can be passed from the C compiler command-line using the -Wl compiler  option,  see
       <b>gcc_minusW</b>  above. This option requires that there be no spaces in the appended linker option, while some
       of the linker options above (like -Map or --defsym) would require a space. In these situations, the space
       can be replaced by an equal sign as well. For example, the following command-line can be used to  compile
       foo.c  into  an  executable, and also produce a link map that contains a cross-reference list in the file
       foo.map:
       $ avr-gcc -mmcu=atmega8 foo.c -o foo.elf -Wl,-Map,foo.map -Wl,--cref
       Alternatively, a comma as a placeholder will be replaced by a space before  passing  the  option  to  the
       linker.  So  for  a device with external SRAM, the following command-line would cause the linker to place
       the data segment at address 0x2000 in the SRAM:
       $ avr-gcc -mmcu=atmega128 foo.c -o foo.elf -Wl,-Tdata,0x802000
       See the explanation of the <b>data</b> <b>section</b> for why 0x800000 needs to be added to the actual value. Note that
       the stack will still remain in internal RAM, through the symbol __stack that is provided by the  run-time
       startup  code.  This  is  probably  a  good  idea  anyway (since internal RAM access is faster), and even
       required for some early devices that had hardware bugs preventing them from using  a  stack  in  external
       RAM.  Note  also  that  the  heap  for  malloc() will still be placed after all the variables in the data
       section, so in this situation, no stack/heap collision can occur.
       In order to relocate the stack from its default location at the top of interns  RAM,  the  value  of  the
       symbol  __stack  can  be  changed  on the linker command-line. As the linker is typically called from the
       compiler frontend, this can be achieved using a compiler option like
       -Wl,--defsym=__stack=0x8003ff
       The above will make the code use stack space from RAM address 0x3ff downwards. The amount of stack  space
       available  then  depends  on  the  bottom  address  of  internal  RAM  for a particular device. It is the
       responsibility of the application to ensure the stack does not grow out of bounds, as well as to  arrange
       for the stack to not collide with variable allocations made by the compiler (sections .data and .bss).
