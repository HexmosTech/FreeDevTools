</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test2::Suite - Distribution with a rich set of tools built upon the Test2 framework.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Rich set of tools, plugins, bundles, etc built upon the Test2 testing library. If you are interested in
       writing tests, this is the distribution for you.

   <b>WHAT</b> <b>ARE</b> <b>TOOLS,</b> <b>PLUGINS,</b> <b>AND</b> <b>BUNDLES?</b>
       TOOLS
           Tools  are  packages  that export functions for use in test files. These functions typically generate
           events. Tools <b>SHOULD</b> <b>NEVER</b> alter behavior of other tools, or the system in general.

       PLUGINS
           Plugins are packages that produce effects, or alter behavior of tools. An example would be  a  plugin
           that causes the test to bail out after the first failure. Plugins <b>SHOULD</b> <b>NOT</b> export anything.

       BUNDLES
           Bundles  are collections of tools and plugins. A bundle should load and re-export functions from Tool
           packages. A bundle may also load and configure any number of plugins.

       If you want to write something that both exports new functions, and effects behavior,  you  should  write
       both  a  Tools  distribution,  and  a  Plugin  distribution,  then a Bundle that loads them both. This is
       important as it helps avoid the problem where a package exports much-desired  tools,  but  also  produces
       undesirable side effects.

</pre><h4><b>INCLUDED</b> <b>BUNDLES</b></h4><pre>
       Test2::V#
           These do not live in the bundle namespace as they are the primary ways to use Test2::Suite.

           The current latest is Test2::V0.

               use Test2::V0;
               # strict and warnings are on for you now.

               ok(...);

               # Note: is does deep checking, unlike the 'is' from Test::More.
               is(...);

               ...

               done_testing;

           This  bundle  includes  every  tool  listed  in  the  "INCLUDED  TOOLS"  section  below,  except  for
           Test2::Tools::ClassicCompare. This bundle provides most of what anyone writing tests could need. This
           is also the preferred bundle/toolset of the Test2 author.

           See Test2::V0 for complete documentation.

       Extended
           <b>**</b> <b>Deprecated</b> <b>**</b> See Test2::V0

               use Test2::Bundle::Extended;
               # strict and warnings are on for you now.

               ok(...);

               # Note: is does deep checking, unlike the 'is' from Test::More.
               is(...);

               ...

               done_testing;

           This  bundle  includes  every  tool  listed  in  the  "INCLUDED  TOOLS"  section  below,  except  for
           Test2::Tools::ClassicCompare. This bundle provides most of what anyone writing tests could need. This
           is also the preferred bundle/toolset of the Test2 author.

           See Test2::Bundle::Extended for complete documentation.

       More
               use Test2::Bundle::More;
               use strict;
               use warnings;

               plan 3; # Or you can use done_testing at the end

               ok(...);

               is(...); # Note: String compare

               is_deeply(...);

               ...

               done_testing; # Use instead of plan

           This  bundle  is  meant  to  be  a <u>mostly</u> drop-in replacement for Test::More.  There are some notable
           differences to be aware of however. Some exports are missing: "eq_array", "eq_hash", "eq_set", $TODO,
           "explain", "use_ok", "require_ok". As well it is no longer possible to set the plan at  import:  "use
           ..  tests  =&gt;  5".  $TODO  has  been  replaced by the todo() function. Planning is done using "plan",
           "skip_all", or "done_testing".

           See Test2::Bundle::More for complete documentation.

       Simple
               use Test2::Bundle::Simple;
               use strict;
               use warnings;

               plan 1;

               ok(...);

           This bundle is meant to be a <u>mostly</u> drop-in replacement for Test::Simple.  See  Test2::Bundle::Simple
           for complete documentation.

</pre><h4><b>INCLUDED</b> <b>TOOLS</b></h4><pre>
       Basic
           Basic  provides  most  of  the  essential  tools previously found in Test::More.  However it does not
           export any tools used for comparison. The basic "pass", "fail", "ok" functions are  present,  as  are
           functions for planning.

           See Test2::Tools::Basic for complete documentation.

       Compare
           This  provides  "is",  "like",  "isnt", "unlike", and several additional helpers. <b>Note:</b> These are all
           <u>deep</u> comparison tools and work like a combination of Test::More's "is" and "is_deeply".

           See Test2::Tools::Compare for complete documentation.

       ClassicCompare
           This provides Test::More flavored "is", "like", "isnt", "unlike", and "is_deeply". It  also  provides
           "cmp_ok".

           See Test2::Tools::ClassicCompare for complete documentation.

       Class
           This provides functions for testing objects and classes, things like "isa_ok".

           See Test2::Tools::Class for complete documentation.

       Defer
           This  provides  functions  for  writing  test functions in one place, but running them later. This is
           useful for testing things that run in an altered state.

           See Test2::Tools::Defer for complete documentation.

       Encoding
           This exports a single function that can be used to change the encoding of all your test output.

           See Test2::Tools::Encoding for complete documentation.

       Exports
           This provides tools for verifying exports. You can verify that functions have been imported, or  that
           they have not been imported.

           See Test2::Tools::Exports for complete documentation.

       Mock
           This  provides  tools  for  mocking  objects  and  classes. This is based largely on Mock::Quick, but
           several interface improvements have been added that cannot be added  to  Mock::Quick  itself  without
           breaking backwards compatibility.

           See Test2::Tools::Mock for complete documentation.

       Ref This exports tools for validating and comparing references.

           See Test2::Tools::Ref for complete documentation.

       Spec
           This is an RSPEC implementation with concurrency support.

           See Test2::Tools::Spec for more details.

       Subtest
           This exports tools for running subtests.

           See Test2::Tools::Subtest for complete documentation.

       Target
           This  lets  you  load  the  package(s)  you  intend  to  test,  and alias them into constants/package
           variables.

           See Test2::Tools::Target for complete documentation.

</pre><h4><b>INCLUDED</b> <b>PLUGINS</b></h4><pre>
       BailOnFail
           The much requested "bail-out on first failure" plugin. When this plugin is loaded, any  failure  will
           cause the test to bail out immediately.

           See Test2::Plugin::BailOnFail for complete documentation.

       DieOnFail
           The  much requested "die on first failure" plugin. When this plugin is loaded, any failure will cause
           the test to die immediately.

           See Test2::Plugin::DieOnFail for complete documentation.

       ExitSummary
           This plugin gives you statistics and diagnostics at the end of your test in the event of a failure.

           See Test2::Plugin::ExitSummary for complete documentation.

       SRand
           Use this to set the random seed to a specific seed, or to the current date.

           See Test2::Plugin::SRand for complete documentation.

       UTF8
           Turn on utf8 for your testing. This sets the current file to be utf8, it also  sets  STDERR,  STDOUT,
           and your formatter to all output utf8.

           See Test2::Plugin::UTF8 for complete documentation.

</pre><h4><b>INCLUDED</b> <b>REQUIREMENT</b> <b>CHECKERS</b></h4><pre>
       AuthorTesting
           Using  this  package  will  cause  the  test file to be skipped unless the AUTHOR_TESTING environment
           variable is set.

           See Test2::Require::AuthorTesting for complete documentation.

       EnvVar
           Using this package will cause the test file to be skipped unless a  custom  environment  variable  is
           set.

           See Test2::Require::EnvVar for complete documentation.

       Fork
           Using  this  package  will  cause the test file to be skipped unless the system is capable of forking
           (including emulated forking).

           See Test2::Require::Fork for complete documentation.

       RealFork
           Using this package will cause the test file to be skipped  unless  the  system  is  capable  of  true
           forking.

           See Test2::Require::RealFork for complete documentation.

       Module
           Using  this  package  will cause the test file to be skipped unless the specified module is installed
           (and optionally at a minimum version).

           See Test2::Require::Module for complete documentation.

       Perl
           Using this package will cause the test file to be skipped unless the specified minimum  perl  version
           is met.

           See Test2::Require::Perl for complete documentation.

       Threads
           Using this package will cause the test file to be skipped unless the system has threading enabled.

           <b>Note:</b> This will not turn threading on for you.

           See Test2::Require::Threads for complete documentation.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       See the Test2 documentation for a namespace map. Everything in this distribution uses Test2.

       Test2::Manual is the Test2 Manual.
