</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       munmap — unmap pages of memory

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

       int munmap(void *<u>addr</u>, size_t <u>len</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>munmap</u>() function shall remove any mappings for those entire pages containing any part of the address
       space  of  the  process  starting at <u>addr</u> and continuing for <u>len</u> bytes. Further references to these pages
       shall result in the generation of a SIGSEGV signal to the process.  If  there  are  no  mappings  in  the
       specified address range, then <u>munmap</u>() has no effect.

       The implementation may require that <u>addr</u> be a multiple of the page size as returned by <u>sysconf</u>().

       If a mapping to be removed was private, any modifications made in this address range shall be discarded.

       Any  memory locks (see <u>mlock</u>() and <u>mlockall</u>()) associated with this address range shall be removed, as if
       by an appropriate call to <u>munlock</u>().

       If a mapping removed from a typed memory object causes the corresponding address range of the memory pool
       to be inaccessible by any process in the system except through allocatable mappings (that is, mappings of
       typed memory objects opened with the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_MAP_ALLOCATABLE flag), then that range of the memory
       pool shall become deallocated and  may  become  available  to  satisfy  future  typed  memory  allocation
       requests.

       A  mapping  removed from a typed memory object opened with the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_MAP_ALLOCATABLE flag shall
       not affect in any way the availability of that typed memory for allocation.

       The behavior of this function is unspecified if the mapping was not established by a call to <u>mmap</u>().

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, <u>munmap</u>() shall return 0; otherwise, it shall  return  -1  and  set  <u>errno</u>  to
       indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>munmap</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> Addresses  in  the  range  [<u>addr</u>,<u>addr</u>+<u>len</u>)  are outside the valid range for the address space of a
              process.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The <u>len</u> argument is 0.

       The <u>munmap</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The <u>addr</u> argument is not a multiple of the page size as returned by <u>sysconf</u>().

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>munmap</u>() function corresponds to SVR4, just as the <u>mmap</u>() function does.

       It is possible that an application has applied process memory locking to a region  that  contains  shared
       memory. If this has occurred, the <u>munmap</u>() call ignores those locks and, if necessary, causes those locks
       to be removed.

       Most implementations require that <u>addr</u> is a multiple of the page size as returned by <u>sysconf</u>().

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
