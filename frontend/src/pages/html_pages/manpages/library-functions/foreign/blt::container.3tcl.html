</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       container - Widget to contain a foreign window.
_________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>container</b> <u>pathName</u> ?<u>options</u>?

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>container</b>  widget  lets you swallow another X11/Win32 toplevel or embed an X11 window from a foreign
       application into your Tk application.  The foreign window is reparented inside of  the  widget.  You  can
       then place and arrange the container just as you would any Tk widget.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       Notebooks  are a popular graphical paradigm.  They allow you to organize many windows in a single widget.
       For example, you might have an application the displays several X-Y graphs at the same time.   Typically,
       you  can't  pack  the graphs into the same <b>frame</b> because they are too large.  The other alternative is to
       pack the graphs into several <b>toplevel</b> widgets, allowing them to overlap on the screen.   The  problem  is
       that all the different toplevel windows clutter the screen and are difficult to manage.

       The  <b>container</b>  widget lets organize your application by displaying each graph as a page in a folder of a
       notebook.  Only one page is visible at a time. When you click on a tab, the folder (graph)  corresponding
       to  the tab is displayed in the <b>container</b> widget.  The container also lets you temporarily tear pages out
       of the notebook into a separate toplevel widget, and put them back in the container later.  For  example,
       you  could  compare  two  graphs  side-by-side  by  tearing  them out, and then replace them when you are
       finished.

       A container may contain an unlimited number of folders.  If there are too many  tabs  to  view,  you  can
       arrange  them  as  multiple  tiers  or  scroll the tabs. The container uses the conventional Tk scrollbar
       syntax, so you can attach a scrollbar too.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       You create a container widget with the <b>container</b> command.

              # Create a new container
              container .c

       A new Tcl command <b>.c</b> is also created.  This command can be used to query and modify the  container.   For
       example,  to  change  the  default  borderwidth,  you  use  the new command and the container's <b>configure</b>
       operation.

              # Change the default font.
              .c configure -borderwidth 2

       You can then add folders using the <b>insert</b> operation.

              # Create a new folder "f1"
              .c coinsert 0 "f1"

       This inserts the new tab named "f1" into the container.  The index <b>0</b> indicates location to insert the new
       tab.  You can also use the index <b>end</b> to append a tab to the end of the container.  By default,  the  text
       of the tab is the name of the tab.  You can change this by configuring the <b>-text</b> option.

              # Change the label of "f1"
              .ts tab configure "f1" -label "Tab #1"

       The <b>insert</b> operation lets you add one or more folders at a time.

              .ts insert end "f2" -label "Tab #2" "f3" "f4"

       The  tab  on each folder contains a label.  A label may display both an image and a text string.  You can
       reconfigure the tab's attributes (foreground/background  colors,  font,  rotation,  etc)  using  the  <b>tab</b>
       <b>configure</b> operation.

              # Add an image to the label of "f1"
              set image [image create photo -file stopsign.gif]
              .ts tab configure "f1" -image $image
              .ts tab configure "f2" -rotate 90

       Each  folder may contain an embedded widget to represent its contents.  The widget to be embedded must be
       a child of the container widget.  Using the <b>-window</b>  option,  you  specify  the  name  of  widget  to  be
       embedded.   But  don't  pack the widget, the container takes care of placing and arranging the widget for
       you.

              graph .ts.graph
              .ts tab configure "f1" -window ".ts.graph" \
                  -fill both -padx 0.25i -pady 0.25i

       The size of the folder is determined the sizes of the Tk widgets embedded inside each folder.  The folder
       will be as wide as the widest widget in any folder. The tallest determines the height.  You can  use  the
       tab's <b>-pagewidth</b> and <b>-pageheight</b> options override this.

       Other  options control how the widget appears in the folder.  The <b>-fill</b> option says that you wish to have
       the widget stretch to fill the available space in the folder.

              .ts tab configure "f1" -fill both -padx 0.25i -pady 0.25i

       Now when you click the left mouse button on "f1", the graph will be displayed in the folder.  It will  be
       automatically  hidden  when  another  folder  is  selected.   If you click on the right mouse button, the
       embedded widget will be moved into a toplevel widget of its own.   Clicking  again  on  the  right  mouse
       button puts it back into the folder.

       If  you  want  to  share a page between two different folders, the <b>-command</b> option lets you specify a Tcl
       command to be invoked whenever the folder is selected.  You can reset the  <b>-window</b>  option  for  the  tab
       whenever it's clicked.

              .ts tab configure "f2" -command {
                  .ts tab configure "f2" -window ".ts.graph"
              }
              .ts tab configure "f1" -command {
                  .ts tab configure "f1" -window ".ts.graph"
              }

       If  you  have  many folders, you may wish to stack tabs in multiple tiers.  The container's <b>-tiers</b> option
       requests a maximum number of tiers.   The default is one tier.

              .ts configure -tiers 2

       If the tabs can fit in less tiers, the widget will use that many.  Whenever there are more tabs than  can
       be  displayed  in  the maximum number of tiers, the container will automatically let you scroll the tabs.
       You can even attach a scrollbar to the container.

              .ts configure -scrollcommand { .sbar set }  -scrollincrement 20
              .sbar configure -orient horizontal -command { .ts view }

       By default tabs are along the top of the container from left to right.  But tabs can  be  placed  on  any
       side of the container using the <b>-side</b> option.

              # Arrange tabs along the right side of the container.
              .ts configure -side right -rotate 270

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>container</b>  command  creates  a  new window using the <u>pathName</u> argument and makes it into a container
       widget.

              <b>container</b> <u>pathName</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...

       Additional options may be specified on the command line or in the option database to configure aspects of
       the container such as its colors, font, text, and relief.  The <b>container</b>  command  returns  its  <u>pathName</u>
       argument.   At  the  time  this  command  is  invoked,  there must not exist a window named <u>pathName</u>, but
       <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.

       When first created, a new container contains no tabs.  Tabs are added or deleted using widget  operations
       described  below.  It  is not necessary for all the tabs to be displayed in the container window at once;
       commands described below may be used to change the view in the window.   Containers  allow  scrolling  of
       tabs  using the <b>-scrollcommand</b> option.  They also support scanning (see the <b>scan</b> operation).  Tabs may be
       arranged along any side of the container window using the <b>-side</b> option.

       The size of the container window is determined the number of tiers of  tabs  and  the  sizes  of  the  Tk
       widgets  embedded  inside each folder.  The widest widget determines the width of the folder. The tallest
       determines the height.  If no folders contain an embedded widget, the size is determined  solely  by  the
       size of the tabs.

       You can override either dimension with the container's <b>-width</b> and <b>-height</b> options.

</pre><h4><b>CONTAINER</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All  <b>container</b>  operations  are  invoked  by  specifying  the  widget's  pathname, the operation, and any
       arguments that pertain to that operation.  The general form is:

                <u>pathName</u> <u>operation</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?

       <u>Operation</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact  behavior  of  the  command.   The  following  operations  are
       available for container widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the
              values accepted by the <b>configure</b> operation described below.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query  or  modify  the  configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a
              list describing all the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>  for  information  on
              the  format  of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list
              describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist  of  the
              value  returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then
              the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given  value(s);   in  this  case  the
              command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> and <u>value</u> are described below:

              <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the border color of the container.

              <b>-borderwidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets the width of the 3-D border around the outside edge of the widget.  The <b>-relief</b> option
                     determines how the border is to be drawn.  The default is <b>2</b>.

              <b>-command</b> <u>pattern</u>
                     Specifies  to  search for a window whose <b>WM_COMMAND</b> property matches the given pattern (X11
                     only).  If no windows, or more than one window, matches the pattern, an error is generated.
                     If <u>pattern</u> is the empty string, then no command search is performed.  The default is <b>""</b>.

              <b>-cursor</b> <u>cursor</u>
                     Specifies the widget's cursor.  The default cursor is <b>""</b>.

              <b>-height</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Specifies the requested height of widget.  If <u>pixels</u> is 0, then the height  is  height  the
                     embedded window plus the specified borderwidth. The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-highlightbackground</b>  <u>color</u>
                     Sets  the  color  to  display in the traversal highlight region when the container does not
                     have the input focus.

              <b>-highlightcolor</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the color to use for the traversal highlight rectangle that is drawn around the widget
                     when it has the input focus.  The default is <b>black</b>.

              <b>-highlightthickness</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets the width of the highlight rectangle to draw around the outside of the widget when  it
                     has  the  input  focus.  <u>Pixels</u>  is  a  non-negative  value  and  may have any of the forms
                     acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  If the value is zero, no focus highlight is drawn  around  the
                     widget.  The default is <b>2</b>.

              <b>-name</b> <u>pattern</u>
                     Specifies  to  search  for  a  window whose <b>WM_NAME</b> property matches the given pattern (X11
                     only).  If no windows, or more than one window, matches the pattern, an error is generated.
                     If <u>pattern</u> is the empty string, then no name search is performed.  The default is <b>""</b>.

              <b>-relief</b> <u>relief</u>
                     Specifies the 3-D effect for the container widget.   <u>Relief</u>  specifies  how  the  container
                     should  appear  relative  to  widget  that it is packed into; for example, <b>raised</b> means the
                     container should appear to protrude.  The default is <b>sunken</b>.

              <b>-takefocus</b> <u>focus</u>
                     Provides information used when  moving  the  focus  from  window  to  window  via  keyboard
                     traversal  (e.g., Tab and Shift-Tab).  If <u>focus</u> is <b>0</b>, this means that this window should be
                     skipped entirely during keyboard traversal.  <b>1</b> means that the  this  window  should  always
                     receive the input focus.  An empty value means that the traversal scripts decide whether to
                     focus on the window.  The default is <b>1</b>.

              <b>-width</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Specifies  the  requested width of the widget.  If <u>pixels</u> is 0, then the width is the width
                     the embedded window and the specified borderwidth.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-window</b> <u>id</u>
                     Specifies the foreign embedded using its path or X window id.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>find</b> <b>-command</b>|<b>-name</b> <u>pattern</u>
              Searches for all windows that match the given pattern.  If  the  <b>-command</b>  switch  is  given,  all
              windows  whose WWM_COMMAND property match <u>pattern</u> are returned in a list (X11 only).  If the <b>-name</b>
              switch is given, all windows whose WWM_NAME property match <u>pattern</u> are returned in  a  list.   The
              list returned will contains pairs of the window id and the matching property.
