</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Toolkit - Keep your handy modules organized

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Toolkit version 0.0.2

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Toolkit;

           # All your favorites are now available

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Toolkit module provides a standard location to store modules that you use all the time, and then
       loads them for you automatically. For example, instead of always writing:

           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Carp;
           use Smart::Comments;

       in every program/module, you can just write:

           use Toolkit;

       and put all your favorite modules in a file:

           &gt; cat $PERL5LIB/Toolkit/Macros/ALWAYS/Modules

           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Carp;
           use Smart::Comments;

       You can also specify load-on-demand subroutines:

           &gt; cat $PERL5LIB/Toolkit/Runtime/prompt

           use IO::Prompt qw( prompt );

           &gt; cat $PERL5LIB/Toolkit/Runtime/say

           sub say { print @_, "\n" }

       in which case Toolkit will install an "AUTOLOAD" that installs these subroutines the first time they're
       called.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       Calling:

           use Toolkit;

       with no arguments loads any files in the directories:

           $PERL5LIB/Toolkit/Macros/ALWAYS/
           $PERL5LIB/Toolkit/Macros/DEFAULT/

       or any of their subdirectories.

       Calling:

           use Toolkit qw(foo bar);

       any files in the directories:

           $PERL5LIB/Toolkit/Macros/ALWAYS/
           $PERL5LIB/Toolkit/Macros/foo/
           $PERL5LIB/Toolkit/Macros/bar/

       or any of their subdirectories.

       Using the Toolkit module in any way also installs an "AUTOLOAD" subroutine which looks in:

           $PERL5LIB/Toolkit/Runtime/

       for a file of the same name as the subroutine that is being autoloaded. That is, if you write:

           use Toolkit;

           baz();

       Then the module looks for a file:

           $PERL5LIB/Toolkit/Runtime/baz

       and executes it in a special namespace. After the file executes, Toolkit expects that the special
       namespace will now have a subroutine of the required name, which it then calls.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Toolkit couldn't open %s
           You  specified  a  particular macro for Toolkit to load, but it wasn't able to read the corresponding
           file. Usually a file permissions problem or a non-existent macro.

       Undefined subroutine %s called
           You used a subroutine that Toolkit couldn't autoload. Did you misspell the subroutine name,  or  fail
           to install a file of the same name in your "$PERL5LIB/Toolkit/Runtime/" subdirectory.

       Toolkit could not load %s (running %s didn't install it).
           You  used  a  subroutine  that  Toolkit  tried  to  autoload.  It found the corresponding file in the
           "$PERL5LIB/Toolkit/Runtime/" subdirectory, but executing that file didn't produce a subroutine of the
           correct name.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Toolkit uses the following directories and files to configure its behaviour:

       $PERL5LIB/Toolkit/Macros/ALWAYS/
           Files in this directory are prepended to your source code whenever Toolkit is used

       $PERL5LIB/Toolkit/Macros/DEFAULT/
           Files in this directory are prepended to your source code whenever Toolkit is used without arguments

       $PERL5LIB/Toolkit/Macros/<u>any</u> <u>file</u> <u>name</u>
           These files are prepended to your source code whenever Toolkit is used and their  name  is  specified
           after the "use Toolkit".

       $PERL5LIB/Toolkit/Runtime/
           Files in this directory are executed to whenever Toolkit is used and a subroutine of the same name is
           called. They are expected to define the required subroutine.
