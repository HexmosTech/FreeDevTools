</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::Ontology::RelationshipI - Interface for a relationship between ontology terms

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # see documentation of methods and an implementation, e.g.,
           # Bio::Ontology::Relationship

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the minimal interface for a relationship between two terms in an ontology. Ontology engines will
       use this.

       The terminology we use here is the one commonly used for ontologies, namely the triple of (subject,
       predicate, object), which in addition is scoped in a namespace (ontology). It is called triple because it
       is a tuple of three ontology terms.

       There are other terminologies in use for expressing relationships. For those who it helps to better
       understand the concept, the triple of (child, relationship type, parent) would be equivalent to the
       terminology chosen here, disregarding the question whether the notion of parent and child is sensible in
       the context of the relationship type or not. Especially in the case of ontologies with a wide variety of
       predicates the parent/child terminology and similar ones can quickly become ambiguous (e.g., A
       synthesises B), meaningless (e.g., A binds B), or even conflicting (e.g., A is-parent-of B), and are
       therefore strongly discouraged.

</pre><h4><b>APPENDIX</b></h4><pre>
       The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods.  Internal methods are usually preceded
       with a _

   <b>identifier</b>
        Title   : identifier
        Usage   : print $rel-&gt;identifier();
        Function: Set/get for the identifier of this Relationship.

                  Note that this may not necessarily be used by a particular
                  ontology.

        Returns : The identifier [scalar].
        Args    :

   <b>subject_term</b>
        Title   : subject_term
        Usage   : $subj = $rel-&gt;subject_term();
        Function: Set/get for the subject term of this Relationship.

                  The common convention for ontologies is to express
                  relationships between terms as triples (subject, predicate,
                  object).

        Returns : The subject term [Bio::Ontology::TermI].
        Args    :

   <b>object_term</b>
        Title   : object_term
        Usage   : $object = $rel-&gt;object_term();
        Function: Set/get for the object term of this Relationship.

                  The common convention for ontologies is to express
                  relationships between terms as triples (subject, predicate,
                  object).

        Returns : The object term [Bio::Ontology::TermI].
        Args    :

   <b>predicate_term</b>
        Title   : predicate_term
        Usage   : $type = $rel-&gt;predicate_term();
        Function: Set/get for the relationship type of this relationship.

                  The common convention for ontologies is to express
                  relationships between terms as triples (subject, predicate,
                  object).

        Returns : The relationship type [Bio::Ontology::TermI].
        Args    :

   <b>ontology</b>
        Title   : ontology
        Usage   : $ont = $obj-&gt;ontology()
        Function: Get the ontology that defined (is the scope for) this
                  relationship.
        Example :
        Returns : an object implementing Bio::Ontology::OntologyI
        Args    :

       See Bio::Ontology::OntologyI.
