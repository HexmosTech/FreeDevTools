</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::Ontology::PathI - Interface for a path between ontology terms

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # see documentation of methods and an implementation, e.g.,
           # Bio::Ontology::Path

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the minimal interface for a path between two terms in an ontology. Ontology engines may use this.

       Essentially this is a very thin extension of the Bio::Ontology::RelationshipI interface. It basically
       adds an attribute <b>distance()</b>. For a RelationshipI, you can think of distance as equal to zero (subject ==
       object) or 1 (subject != object).

       User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other Bioperl modules. Send your comments
       and suggestions preferably to the Bioperl mailing list.  Your participation is much appreciated.

       rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and reponsive experts will be able look

</pre><h4><b>APPENDIX</b></h4><pre>
       The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods.  Internal methods are usually preceded
       with a _

   <b>distance</b>
        Title   : distance
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;distance($newval)
        Function: Get (and set if the implementation allows it) the distance
                  between the two terms connected by this path.

        Example :
        Returns : value of distance (a scalar)
        Args    : on set, new value (a scalar or undef, optional)

</pre><h4><b>Bio::Ontology::RelationshipI</b> <b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
   <b>subject_term</b>
        Title   : subject_term
        Usage   : $subj = $rel-&gt;subject_term();
        Function: Set/get for the subject term of this Relationship.

                  The common convention for ontologies is to express
                  relationships between terms as triples (subject, predicate,
                  object).

        Returns : The subject term [Bio::Ontology::TermI].
        Args    :

   <b>object_term</b>
        Title   : object_term
        Usage   : $object = $rel-&gt;object_term();
        Function: Set/get for the object term of this Relationship.

                  The common convention for ontologies is to express
                  relationships between terms as triples (subject, predicate,
                  object).

        Returns : The object term [Bio::Ontology::TermI].
        Args    :

   <b>predicate_term</b>
        Title   : predicate_term
        Usage   : $type = $rel-&gt;predicate_term();
        Function: Set/get for the predicate of this relationship.

                  For a path the predicate (relationship type) is defined as
                  the greatest common denominator of all predicates
                  (relationship types) encountered along the path. I.e., if
                  predicate A is-a predicate B, the greatest common
                  denominator for a path containing both predicates A and B is B

        Returns : The predicate term [Bio::Ontology::TermI].
        Args    :

   <b>ontology</b>
        Title   : ontology
        Usage   : $ont = $obj-&gt;ontology()
        Function: Get the ontology that defined this relationship.
        Example :
        Returns : an object implementing Bio::Ontology::OntologyI
        Args    :

       See Bio::Ontology::OntologyI.
