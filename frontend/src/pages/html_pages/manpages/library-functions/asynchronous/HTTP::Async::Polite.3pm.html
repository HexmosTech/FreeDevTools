</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP::Async::Polite - politely process multiple HTTP requests

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       See HTTP::Async - the usage is unchanged.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This HTTP::Async module allows you to have many requests going on at once.  This can be very rude if you
       are fetching several pages from the same domain.  This module add limits to the number of simultaneous
       requests to a given domain and adds an interval between the requests.

       In all other ways it is identical in use to the original HTTP::Async.

</pre><h4><b>NEW</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>send_interval</b>
       Getter and setter for the "send_interval" - the time in seconds to leave between each request for a given
       domain. By default this is set to 5 seconds.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLOADED</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       These methods are overloaded but otherwise work exactly as the original methods did. The docs here just
       describe what they do differently.

   <b>new</b>
       Sets the "send_interval" value to the default of 5 seconds.

   <b>add_with_opts</b>
       Adds the request to the correct queue depending on the domain.

   <b>to_send_count</b>
       Returns the number of requests waiting to be sent. This is the number in the actual queue plus the number
       in each domain specific queue.
