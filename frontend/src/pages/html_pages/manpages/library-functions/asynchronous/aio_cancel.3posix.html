</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       aio_cancel — cancel an asynchronous I/O request

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/aio.h">aio.h</a>&gt;

       int aio_cancel(int <u>fildes</u>, struct aiocb *<u>aiocbp</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>aio_cancel</u>()  function  shall  attempt  to  cancel  one  or more asynchronous I/O requests currently
       outstanding against file descriptor <u>fildes</u>.  The <u>aiocbp</u> argument points to the asynchronous  I/O  control
       block  for  a  particular  request  to  be  canceled.  If <u>aiocbp</u> is NULL, then all outstanding cancelable
       asynchronous I/O requests against <u>fildes</u> shall be canceled.

       Normal asynchronous notification shall occur  for  asynchronous  I/O  operations  that  are  successfully
       canceled.  If there are requests that cannot be canceled, then the normal asynchronous completion process
       shall take place for those requests when they are completed.

       For requested operations that are successfully canceled, the associated error  status  shall  be  set  to
       <b>[ECANCELED]</b>  and  the  return  status  shall  be  -1.  For requested operations that are not successfully
       canceled, the <u>aiocbp</u> shall not be modified by <u>aio_cancel</u>().

       If <u>aiocbp</u> is not NULL, then if <u>fildes</u> does not have the same value as the file descriptor with which  the
       asynchronous operation was initiated, unspecified results occur.

       Which operations are cancelable is implementation-defined.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>aio_cancel</u>()  function  shall  return  the  value  AIO_CANCELED  if  the requested operation(s) were
       canceled.  The value AIO_NOTCANCELED shall be returned if at least  one  of  the  requested  operation(s)
       cannot  be  canceled  because it is in progress. In this case, the state of the other operations, if any,
       referenced in the call to <u>aio_cancel</u>() is not  indicated  by  the  return  value  of  <u>aio_cancel</u>().   The
       application  may  determine  the  state  of affairs for these operations by using <u>aio_error</u>().  The value
       AIO_ALLDONE is returned if all of the operations have already completed.  Otherwise, the  function  shall
       return -1 and set <u>errno</u> to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>aio_cancel</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>fildes</u> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
