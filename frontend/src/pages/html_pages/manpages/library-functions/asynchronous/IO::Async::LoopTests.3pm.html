</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "IO::Async::LoopTests" - acceptance testing for IO::Async::Loop subclasses

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use IO::Async::LoopTests;
          run_tests( 'IO::Async::Loop::Shiney', 'io' );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module contains a collection of test functions for running acceptance tests on IO::Async::Loop
       subclasses. It is provided as a facility for authors of such subclasses to ensure that the code conforms
       to the Loop API required by IO::Async.

</pre><h4><b>TIMING</b></h4><pre>
       Certain tests require the use of timers or timed delays. Normally these are counted in units of seconds.
       By setting the environment variable "TEST_QUICK_TIMERS" to some true value, these timers run 10 times
       quicker, being measured in units of 0.1 seconds instead. This value may be useful when running the tests
       interactively, to avoid them taking too long. The slower timers are preferred on automated smoke-testing
       machines, to help guard against false negatives reported simply because of scheduling delays or high
       system load while testing.

          $ TEST_QUICK_TIMERS=1 ./Build test

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>run_tests</b>
          run_tests( $class, @tests );

       Runs a test or collection of tests against the loop subclass given. The class being tested is loaded by
       this function; the containing script does not need to "require" or "use" it first.

       This function runs "plan" to output its expected test count; the containing script should not do this.

</pre><h4><b>TEST</b> <b>SUITES</b></h4><pre>
       The following test suite names exist, to be passed as a name in the @tests argument to "run_tests":

   <b>io</b>
       Tests the Loop's ability to watch filehandles for IO readiness

   <b>timer</b>
       Tests the Loop's ability to handle timer events

   <b>signal</b>
       Tests the Loop's ability to watch POSIX signals

   <b>idle</b>
       Tests the Loop's support for idle handlers

   <b>process</b>
       Tests the Loop's support for watching child processes by PID

       (Previously called "child")

   <b>control</b>
       Tests that the "run", "stop", "loop_once" and "loop_forever" methods behave correctly

   <b>metrics</b>
       Tests that metrics are generated appropriately using Metrics::Any.
