</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This collection of modules allows programs to be written that perform asynchronous filehandle IO
       operations. A typical program using them would consist of a single subclass of IO::Async::Loop to act as
       a container of other objects, which perform the actual IO work required by the program. As well as IO
       handles, the loop also supports timers and signal handlers, and includes more higher-level functionality
       built on top of these basic parts.

       Because there are a lot of classes in this collection, the following overview gives a brief description
       of each.

   <b>Notifiers</b>
       The base class of all the event handling subclasses is IO::Async::Notifier.  It does not perform any IO
       operations itself, but instead acts as a base class to build the specific IO functionality upon. It can
       also coordinate a collection of other Notifiers contained within it, forming a tree structure.

       The following sections describe particular types of Notifier.

   <b>File</b> <b>Handle</b> <b>IO</b>
       An IO::Async::Handle object is a Notifier that represents a single IO handle being managed. While in most
       cases it will represent a single filehandle, such as a socket (for example, an IO::Socket::INET
       connection), it is possible to have separate reading and writing handles (most likely for a program's
       "STDIN" and "STDOUT" streams, or a pair of pipes connected to a child process).

       The IO::Async::Stream class is a subclass of IO::Async::Handle which maintains internal incoming and
       outgoing data buffers. In this way, it implements bidirectional buffering of a byte stream, such as a TCP
       socket. The class automatically handles reading of incoming data into the incoming buffer, and writing of
       the outgoing buffer. Methods or callbacks are used to inform when new incoming data is available, or when
       the outgoing buffer is empty.

       While stream-based sockets can be handled using using IO::Async::Stream, datagram or raw sockets do not
       provide a bytestream. For these, the IO::Async::Socket class is another subclass of IO::Async::Handle
       which maintains an outgoing packet queue, and informs of packet receipt using a callback or method.

       The IO::Async::Listener class is another subclass of IO::Async::Handle which facilitates the use of
       <a href="../man2/listen.2.html">listen</a>(2)-mode sockets. When a new connection is available on the socket it will <a href="../man2/accept.2.html">accept</a>(2) it and pass
       the new client socket to its callback function.

   <b>Timers</b>
       An IO::Async::Timer::Absolute object represents a timer that expires at a given absolute time in the
       future.

       An IO::Async::Timer::Countdown object represents a count time timer, which will invoke a callback after a
       given delay. It can be stopped and restarted.

       An IO::Async::Timer::Periodic object invokes a callback at regular intervals from its initial start time.
       It is reliable and will not drift due to the time taken to run the callback.

       The IO::Async::Loop also supports methods for managing timed events on a lower level. Events may be
       absolute, or relative in time to the time they are installed.

   <b>Signals</b>
       An IO::Async::Signal object represents a POSIX signal, which will invoke a callback when the given signal
       is received by the process. Multiple objects watching the same signal can be used; they will all invoke
       in no particular order.

   <b>Processes</b> <b>Management</b>
       An IO::Async::PID object invokes its event when a given child process exits. An IO::Async::Process object
       can start a new child process running either a given block of code, or executing a given command, set up
       pipes on its filehandles, write to or read from these pipes, and invoke its event when the child process
       exits.

   <b>Loops</b>
       The IO::Async::Loop object class represents an abstract collection of IO::Async::Notifier objects, and
       manages the actual filehandle IO watchers, timers, signal handlers, and other functionality. It performs
       all of the abstract collection management tasks, and leaves the actual OS interactions to a particular
       subclass for the purpose.

       IO::Async::Loop::Poll uses an IO::Poll object for this test.

       IO::Async::Loop::Select uses the <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a>(2) syscall.

       Other subclasses of loop may appear on CPAN under their own dists; see the "SEE ALSO" section below for
       more detail.

       As well as these general-purpose classes, the IO::Async::Loop constructor also supports looking for OS-
       specific subclasses, in case a more efficient implementation exists for the specific OS it runs on.

   <b>Child</b> <b>Processes</b>
       The IO::Async::Loop object provides a number of methods to facilitate the running of child processes.
       "spawn_child" is primarily a wrapper around the typical <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a>(2)/<a href="../man2/exec.2.html">exec</a>(2) style of starting child
       processes, and "run_child" provide a method similar to perl's "readpipe" (which is used to implement
       backticks ``).

   <b>File</b> <b>Change</b> <b>Watches</b>
       The IO::Async::File object observes changes to <a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a>(2) properties of a file, directory, or other
       filesystem object. It invokes callbacks when properties change. This is used by IO::Async::FileStream
       which presents the same events as a IO::Async::Stream but operates on a regular file on the filesystem,
       observing it for updates.

   <b>Asynchronous</b> <b>Co-routines</b> <b>and</b> <b>Functions</b>
       The "IO::Async" framework generally provides mechanisms for multiplexing IO tasks between different
       handles, so there aren't many occasions when it is necessary to run code in another thread or process.
       Two cases where this does become useful are when:

       •   A large amount of computationally-intensive work needs to be performed.

       •   An  OS  or library-level function needs to be called, that will block, and no asynchronous version is
           supplied.

       For these cases, an instance of IO::Async::Function can be used around a code block, to execute it  in  a
       worker  child  process  or  set  of  processes.   The code in the sub-process runs isolated from the main
       program, communicating only by function call arguments and return values.  This  can  be  used  to  solve
       problems involving state-less library functions.

       An  IO::Async::Routine  object  wraps  a  code  block running in a separate process to form a kind of co-
       routine. Communication with it happens via IO::Async::Channel objects. It can be used to solve  any  sort
       of problem involving keeping a possibly-stateful co-routine running alongside the rest of an asynchronous
       program.

   <b>Futures</b>
       An  IO::Async::Future  object  represents  a single outstanding action that is yet to complete, such as a
       name resolution operation or a socket connection.  It stands in contrast to a IO::Async::Notifier,  which
       is  an  object that represents an ongoing source of activity, such as a readable filehandle of bytes or a
       POSIX signal.

       Futures are a recent addition to the "IO::Async"  API  and  details  are  still  subject  to  change  and
       experimentation.

       In  general,  methods  that  support  Futures  return  a  new  Future object to represent the outstanding
       operation. If callback functions are supplied as well, these will be fired  in  addition  to  the  Future
       object  becoming ready. Any failures that are reported will, in general, use the same conventions for the
       Future's "fail" arguments to relate it to the legacy "on_error"-style callbacks.

          $on_NAME_error-&gt;( $message, @argmuents )

          $f-&gt;fail( $message, NAME, @arguments )

       where $message is a message intended for humans to read  (so  that  this  is  the  message  displayed  by
       "$f-&gt;get"  if  the  failure is not otherwise caught), "NAME" is the name of the failing operation. If the
       failure is due to a failed system call, the value of $! will be the final argument.  The  message  should
       not end with a linefeed.

   <b>Networking</b>
       The IO::Async::Loop provides several methods for performing network-based tasks. Primarily, the "connect"
       and  "listen" methods allow the creation of client or server network sockets. Additionally, the "resolve"
       method allows the use of the system's name resolvers in  an  asynchronous  way,  to  resolve  names  into
       addresses, or vice versa. These methods are fully IPv6-capable if the underlying operating system is.

   <b>Protocols</b>
       The  IO::Async::Protocol class provides storage for a IO::Async::Handle object, to act as a transport for
       some protocol. It allows a level of independence from the  actual  transport  being  for  that  protocol,
       allowing  it  to  be easily reused. The IO::Async::Protocol::Stream subclass provides further support for
       protocols based on stream connections, such as TCP sockets.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       This collection of modules is still very much in development. As a result, some of the potentially-useful
       parts or features currently missing are:

       •   Consider further ideas on Solaris' <u>ports</u>, BSD's <u>Kevents</u> and anything that might be useful on Win32.

       •   Consider some form of persistent object wrapper in the  form  of  an  "IO::Async::Object",  based  on
           IO::Async::Routine.

       •   "IO::Async::Protocol::Datagram"

       •   Support  for  watching filesystem entries for change. Extract logic from IO::Async::File and define a
           Loop watch/unwatch method pair.

       •   Define  more  Future-returning   methods.   Consider   also   one-shot   Futures   on   things   like
           IO::Async::Process exits, or IO::Async::Handle close.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Bugs may be reported via RT at

          https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=IO-Async

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       As  well  as the two loops supplied in this distribution, many more exist on CPAN. At the time of writing
       this includes:
