</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "IO::Async::Timer" - base class for Notifiers that use timed delays

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a subclass of IO::Async::Notifier for implementing notifiers that use timed delays.
       For specific implementations, see one of the subclasses:

       •       IO::Async::Timer::Absolute - event callback at a fixed future time

       •       IO::Async::Timer::Countdown - event callback after a fixed delay

       •       IO::Async::Timer::Periodic - event callback at regular intervals

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
          $timer = IO::Async::Timer-&gt;new( %args );

       Constructs  a  particular  subclass  of  "IO::Async::Timer"  object,  and returns it. This constructor is
       provided for backward compatibility to older code which doesn't  use  the  subclasses.  New  code  should
       directly construct a subclass instead.

       mode =&gt; STRING
               The type of timer to create. Currently the only allowed mode is "countdown" but more types may be
               added in the future.

       Once  constructed, the "Timer" will need to be added to the "Loop" before it will work. It will also need
       to be started by the "start" method.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>is_running</b>
          $running = $timer-&gt;is_running;

       Returns true if the Timer has been started, and has not yet expired, or been stopped.

   <b>start</b>
          $timer-&gt;start;

       Starts the Timer. Throws an error if it was already running.

       If the Timer is not yet in a Loop, the actual start will be deferred until it is added.  Once  added,  it
       will be running, and will expire at the given duration after the time it was added.

       As a convenience, $timer is returned. This may be useful for starting timers at construction time:

          $loop-&gt;add( IO::Async::Timer-&gt;new( ... )-&gt;start );

   <b>stop</b>
          $timer-&gt;stop;

       Stops  the  Timer  if  it  is  running.  If  it has not yet been added to the "Loop" but there is a start
       pending, this will cancel it.
