</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       aio_read — asynchronous read from a file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/aio.h">aio.h</a>&gt;

       int aio_read(struct aiocb *<u>aiocbp</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>aio_read</u>()  function  shall read <u>aiocbp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_nbytes</u> from the file associated with <u>aiocbp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_fildes</u>
       into the buffer pointed to by <u>aiocbp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_buf</u>. The function call shall return when the read  request  has
       been initiated or queued to the file or device (even when the data cannot be delivered immediately).

       If  prioritized  I/O  is supported for this file, then the asynchronous operation shall be submitted at a
       priority equal to a base scheduling priority minus <u>aiocbp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_reqprio</u>. If Thread Execution Scheduling is
       not supported, then the base scheduling priority is that of the calling process;
       otherwise, the base scheduling priority is that of the calling thread.

       The <u>aiocbp</u> value may be used as an argument to <u>aio_error</u>() and <u>aio_return</u>() in  order  to  determine  the
       error status and return status, respectively, of the asynchronous operation while it is proceeding. If an
       error condition is encountered during queuing, the function call shall return without having initiated or
       queued  the request. The requested operation takes place at the absolute position in the file as given by
       <u>aio_offset</u>, as if <u>lseek</u>() were called immediately  prior  to  the  operation  with  an  <u>offset</u>  equal  to
       <u>aio_offset</u>  and  a  <u>whence</u>  equal  to  SEEK_SET.   After a successful call to enqueue an asynchronous I/O
       operation, the value of the file offset for the file is unspecified.

       The <u>aio_sigevent</u> member specifies the notification which occurs when the request is completed.

       The <u>aiocbp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_lio_opcode</u> field shall be ignored by <u>aio_read</u>().

       The <u>aiocbp</u> argument points to an <b>aiocb</b> structure. If the buffer pointed  to  by  <u>aiocbp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_buf</u>  or  the
       control  block pointed to by <u>aiocbp</u> becomes an illegal address prior to asynchronous I/O completion, then
       the behavior is undefined.

       Simultaneous asynchronous operations using the same <u>aiocbp</u> produce undefined results.

       If synchronized I/O is enabled on the file associated  with  <u>aiocbp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_fildes</u>,  the  behavior  of  this
       function  shall  be  according  to  the  definitions  of  synchronized  I/O data integrity completion and
       synchronized I/O file integrity completion.

       For any system action that changes the process memory space while an asynchronous I/O is  outstanding  to
       the address range being changed, the result of that action is undefined.

       For  regular  files,  no  data  transfer shall occur past the offset maximum established in the open file
       description associated with <u>aiocbp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_fildes</u>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>aio_read</u>() function shall return the  value  zero  if  the  I/O  operation  is  successfully  queued;
       otherwise, the function shall return the value -1 and set <u>errno</u> to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>aio_read</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> The requested asynchronous I/O operation was not queued due to system resource limitations.

       Each  of the following conditions may be detected synchronously at the time of the call to <u>aio_read</u>(), or
       asynchronously. If any of the conditions below are detected synchronously, the <u>aio_read</u>() function  shall
       return  -1  and  set  <u>errno</u>  to  the  corresponding  value.  If  any of the conditions below are detected
       asynchronously, the return status of the asynchronous operation is set to -1, and the error status of the
       asynchronous operation is set to the corresponding value.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>aiocbp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_fildes</u> argument is not a valid file descriptor open for reading.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The file offset value implied by <u>aiocbp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_offset</u> would be invalid,
              <u>aiocbp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_reqprio</u> is not a valid value, or <u>aiocbp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_nbytes</u> is an invalid value.

       In the case that the <u>aio_read</u>() successfully queues the I/O operation but the operation  is  subsequently
       canceled  or  encounters  an  error, the return status of the asynchronous operation is one of the values
       normally returned by the <u>read</u>() function  call.  In  addition,  the  error  status  of  the  asynchronous
       operation  is  set  to  one of the error statuses normally set by the <u>read</u>() function call, or one of the
       following values:

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>aiocbp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_fildes</u> argument is not a valid file descriptor open for reading.

       <b>ECANCELED</b>
              The requested I/O was canceled before the I/O completed due to an explicit <u>aio_cancel</u>() request.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The file offset value implied by <u>aiocbp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_offset</u> would be invalid.

       The following condition may be detected synchronously or asynchronously:

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The file is a regular file, <u>aiobcp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_nbytes</u> is greater than  0,  and  the  starting  offset  in
              <u>aiobcp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_offset</u>  is  before  the end-of-file and is at or beyond the offset maximum in the open
              file description associated with <u>aiocbp</u>-&gt;<u>aio_fildes</u>.
