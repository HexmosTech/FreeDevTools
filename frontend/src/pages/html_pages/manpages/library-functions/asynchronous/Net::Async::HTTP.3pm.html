          use Future::AsyncAwait;

          use IO::Async::Loop;
          use Net::Async::HTTP;
          use URI;

          my $loop = IO::Async::Loop-&gt;new();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This object class implements an asynchronous HTTP user agent. It sends requests to servers, returning
       Future instances to yield responses when they are received. The object supports multiple concurrent
       connections to servers, and allows multiple requests in the pipeline to any one connection.  Normally,
       only one such object will be needed per program to support any number of requests.

       As well as using futures the module also supports a callback-based interface.

       This module optionally supports SSL connections, if IO::Async::SSL is installed. If so, SSL can be
       requested either by passing a URI with the "https" scheme, or by passing a true value as the "SSL"
       parameter.

   <b>Connection</b> <b>Pooling</b>
       There are three ways in which connections to HTTP server hosts are managed by this object, controlled by
       the value of "max_connections_per_host". This controls when new connections are established to servers,
       as compared to waiting for existing connections to be free, as new requests are made to them.

       They are:

       max_connections_per_host = 1
         This  is  the  default  setting. In this mode, there will be one connection per host on which there are
         active or pending requests. If new requests are made while an existing one is outstanding, they will be
         queued to wait for it.

         If pipelining is active on the  connection  (because  both  the  "pipeline"  option  is  true  and  the
         connection  is  known  to  be  an HTTP/1.1 server), then requests will be pipelined into the connection
         awaiting their response. If not, they will be queued awaiting a response to the previous before sending
         the next.

       max_connections_per_host &gt; 1
         In this mode, there can be more than one connection per host. If a new request is made, it will try  to
         re-use  idle  connections  if there are any, or if they are all busy it will create a new connection to
         the host, up to the configured limit.

       max_connections_per_host = 0
         In this mode, there is no upper limit to the number of connections per host.  Every  new  request  will
         try to reuse an idle connection, or else create a new one if all the existing ones are busy.

       These  modes  all  apply per hostname / server port pair; they do not affect the behaviour of connections
       made to differing hostnames, or differing ports on the same hostname.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The following named parameters may be passed to "new" or "configure":

   <b>user_agent</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>STRING</b>
       A string to set in the "User-Agent" HTTP header. If not supplied, one will be constructed  that  declares
       "Net::Async::HTTP" and the version number.

   <b>headers</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>ARRAY</b> <b>or</b> <b>HASH</b>
       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.45.</u>

       A set of extra headers to apply to every outgoing request. May be specified either as an even-sized array
       containing key/value pairs, or a hash.

       Individual  header values may be added or changed without replacing the entire set by using the configure
       method and passing a key called "+headers":

          $http-&gt;configure( +headers =&gt; { One_More =&gt; "Key" } );

   <b>max_redirects</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>INT</b>
       Optional. How many levels of redirection to follow. If not supplied, will default to 3. Give 0 to disable
       redirection entirely.

   <b>max_in_flight</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>INT</b>
       Optional. The maximum number of in-flight requests to allow per  host  when  pipelining  is  enabled  and
       supported  on  that host. If more requests are made over this limit they will be queued internally by the
       object and not sent to the server until responses are received. If not supplied, will default to 4.  Give
       0 to disable the limit entirely.

   <b>max_connections_per_host</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>INT</b>
       Optional. Controls the maximum number of connections per hostname/server port pair, before requests  will
       be  queued  awaiting  one  to  be  free.  Give  0 to disable the limit entirely. See also the "Connection
       Pooling" section documented above.

       Currently, if not supplied it will default to 1. However,  it  has  been  found  in  practice  that  most
       programs  will  raise this limit to something higher, perhaps 3 or 4. Therefore, a future version of this
       module may set a higher value.

       To test if your application will handle this correctly, you can set a different  default  by  setting  an
       environment variable:

          $ NET_ASYNC_HTTP_MAXCONNS=3 perl ...

   <b>timeout</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>NUM</b>
       Optional. How long in seconds to wait before giving up on a request. If not supplied then no default will
       be applied, and no timeout will take place.

   <b>stall_timeout</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>NUM</b>
       Optional. How long in seconds to wait after each write or read of data on a socket, before giving up on a
       request.  This  may  be  more  useful  than  "timeout"  on large-file operations, as it will not time out
       provided that regular progress is still being made.

   <b>proxy_host</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>STRING</b>
   <b>proxy_port</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>INT</b>
       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.10.</u>

   <b>proxy_path</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>PATH</b>
       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.49.</u>

       Optional. Default values to apply to each "request" method.

   <b>cookie_jar</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>HTTP::Cookies</b>
       Optional. A reference to a HTTP::Cookies object. Will be used to set cookies in requests and  store  them
       from responses.

   <b>pipeline</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>BOOL</b>
       Optional. If false, disables HTTP/1.1-style request pipelining.

   <b>close_after_request</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>BOOL</b>
       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.45.</u>

       Optional.  If  true, will set the "Connection: close" header on outgoing requests and disable pipelining,
       thus making every request use a new connection.

   <b>family</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>INT</b>
   <b>local_host</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>STRING</b>
   <b>local_port</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>INT</b>
   <b>local_addrs</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>ARRAY</b>
   <b>local_addr</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>HASH</b> <b>or</b> <b>ARRAY</b>
       Optional. Parameters to pass on to the "connect" method used to connect sockets to HTTP servers. Sets the
       socket family and local socket  address  to  bind()  to.  For  more  detail,  see  the  documentation  in
       IO::Async::Connector.

   <b>fail_on_error</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>BOOL</b>
       Optional.  Affects  the  behaviour  of response handling when a "4xx" or "5xx" response code is received.
       When false, these responses will be processed as other responses and yielded as the result of the future,
       or passed to the "on_response" callback. When true, such an error response causes the future to fail,  or
       the "on_error" callback to be invoked.

       The  HTTP  response  and  request objects will be passed as well as the code and message, and the failure
       name will be "http".

          ( $code_message, "http", $response, $request ) = $f-&gt;failure

          $on_error-&gt;( "$code $message", $response, $request )

   <b>read_len</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>INT</b>
   <b>write_len</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>INT</b>
       Optional. Used to set the reading and  writing  buffer  lengths  on  the  underlying  "IO::Async::Stream"
       objects that represent connections to the server. If not define, a default of 64 KiB will be used.

   <b>ip_tos</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>INT</b> <b>or</b> <b>STRING</b>
       Optional.  Used  to  set  the  "IP_TOS"  socket  option  on  client sockets. If given, should either be a
       "IPTOS_*" constant, or one of the string names "lowdelay", "throughput", "reliability" or  "mincost".  If
       undefined or left absent, no option will be set.

   <b>decode_content</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>BOOL</b>
       Optional.  If  true,  incoming  responses  that  have  a recognised "Content-Encoding" are handled by the
       module,  and  decompressed  content  is  passed  to  the  body  handling  callback  or  returned  in  the
       "HTTP::Response".  See "CONTENT DECODING" below for details of which encoding types are recognised.  When
       this option is enabled, outgoing requests also have the "Accept-Encoding" header added to them if it does
       not already exist.

       Currently the default is false, because this behaviour is new, but it may default  to  true  in  a  later
       version.  Applications which care which behaviour applies should set this to a defined value to ensure it
       doesn't change.

   <b>SSL_*</b>
       Additionally, any parameters whose names start with "SSL_" will be  stored  and  passed  on  requests  to
       perform SSL requests. This simplifies configuration of common SSL parameters.

   <b>require_SSL</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>BOOL</b>
       Optional. If true, then any attempt to make a request that does not use SSL (either by calling "request",
       or as a result of a redirection) will immediately fail.

   <b>SOCKS_*</b>
       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.42.</u>

       Additionally, any parameters whose names start with "SOCKS_" will be stored and used by Net::Async::SOCKS
       to establish connections via a configured proxy.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods documented in an "await" expression return Future instances.

       When  returning  a  Future, the following methods all indicate HTTP-level errors using the Future failure
       name of "http". If the error relates to a specific response it will be included. The original request  is
       also included.

          $f-&gt;fail( $message, "http", $response, $request )

   <b>do_request</b>
          $response = await $http-&gt;do_request( %args );

       Send  an  HTTP  request  to a server, returning a Future that will yield the response. The request may be
       represented by an HTTP::Request object, or a URI object, depending on the arguments passed.

       The following named arguments are used for "HTTP::Request"s:

       request =&gt; HTTP::Request
               A reference to an "HTTP::Request" object

       host =&gt; STRING
               Hostname of the server to connect to

       port =&gt; INT or STRING
               Optional. Port number or service of the server to connect to. If not  defined,  will  default  to
               "http" or "https" depending on whether SSL is being used.

       family =&gt; INT or STRING
               Optional.  Restricts  the  socket  family  for  connecting.  If  not defined, will default to the
               globally-configured value in the object. The value may either be a "PF_*" constant  directly,  or
               the lowercase name of one such as "inet".

       SSL =&gt; BOOL
               Optional. If true, an SSL connection will be used.

       The following named arguments are used for "URI" requests:

       uri =&gt; URI or STRING
               A reference to a "URI" object, or a plain string giving the request URI. If the scheme is "https"
               then an SSL connection will be used.

       method =&gt; STRING
               Optional. The HTTP method name. If missing, "GET" is used.

       content =&gt; STRING or ARRAY ref
               Optional. The body content to use for "PUT" or "POST" requests.

               If  this  is  a  plain  scalar  it will be used directly, and a "content_type" field must also be
               supplied to describe it.

               If this is an ARRAY ref and the request method is "POST", it will  be  form  encoded.  It  should
               contain  an  even-sized  list  of  field  names  and  values.  For  more  detail  see  "POST"  in
               HTTP::Request::Common.

       content_type =&gt; STRING
               The type of non-form data "content".

       user =&gt; STRING
       pass =&gt; STRING
               Optional. If both are given, the HTTP Basic Authorization header will be sent with these details.

       headers =&gt; ARRAY|HASH
               Optional. If provided, contains additional HTTP headers to set on the constructed request object.
               If provided as an ARRAY reference, it should contain an even-sized list of name/value pairs.

       proxy_host =&gt; STRING
       proxy_port =&gt; INT
               <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.10.</u>

               Optional. Override the hostname or port number implied by the URI.

       proxy_path =&gt; PATH
               <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.49.</u>

               Optional. Set a UNIX socket path to use as a proxy. To make use of this, also  set  the  "family"
               argument to "unix".

       For either request type, it takes the following arguments:

       request_body =&gt; STRING | CODE | Future
               Optional.  Allows request body content to be generated by a future or callback, rather than being
               provided as part of the "request" object. This can either be a plain string, a  "CODE"  reference
               to a generator function, or a future.

               As  this  is passed to the underlying IO::Async::Stream "write" method, the usual semantics apply
               here. If passed a "CODE" reference, it will be called repeatedly whenever it's safe to write. The
               code should should return "undef" to indicate completion. If passed a "Future" it is expected  to
               eventually yield the body value.

               As  with  the "content" parameter, the "content_type" field should be specified explicitly in the
               request header, as should the content length (typically via  the  HTTP::Request  "content_length"
               method). See also <u>examples/PUT.pl</u>.

       expect_continue =&gt; BOOL
               Optional. If true, sets the "Expect" request header to the value "100-continue" and does not send
               the  "request_body"  parameter until a "100 Continue" response is received from the server. If an
               error response is received then the "request_body" code, if present, will not be invoked.

       on_ready =&gt; CODE
               Optional. A callback that is invoked once a  socket  connection  is  established  with  the  HTTP
               server,  but  before the request is actually sent over it. This may be used by the client code to
               inspect the socket, or perform any other operations on it. This code  is  expected  to  return  a
               "Future"; only once that has completed will the request cycle continue. If it fails, that failure
               is propagated to the caller.

                  $f = $on_ready-&gt;( $connection );

       on_redirect =&gt; CODE
               Optional.  A callback that is invoked if a redirect response is received, before the new location
               is fetched. It will be passed the response and the new URL.

                  $on_redirect-&gt;( $response, $location );

       on_body_write =&gt; CODE
               Optional. A callback that is invoked after each successful "syswrite" of the body  content.  This
               may  be  used  to  implement an upload progress indicator or similar. It will be passed the total
               number of bytes of body content written so far (i.e. excluding bytes consumed in the header).

                  $on_body_write-&gt;( $written );

       max_redirects =&gt; INT
               Optional. How many levels of redirection to follow. If not supplied, will default  to  the  value
               given in the constructor.

       timeout =&gt; NUM
       stall_timeout =&gt; NUM
               Optional.  Overrides  the  object's  configured  timeout  values  for  this  one  request. If not
               specified, will use the configured defaults.

               On a timeout, the returned future will fail with  either  "timeout"  or  "stall_timeout"  as  the
               operation name.

                  ( $message, "timeout" ) = $f-&gt;failure;

   <b>do_request</b> <b>(void)</b>
          $http-&gt;do_request( %args );

       When not returning a future, the following extra arguments are used as callbacks instead:

       on_response =&gt; CODE
               A  callback that is invoked when a response to this request has been received.  It will be passed
               an HTTP::Response object containing the response the server sent.

                  $on_response-&gt;( $response );

       on_header =&gt; CODE
               Alternative to "on_response". A callback that is invoked when the header of a response  has  been
               received.  It  is expected to return a "CODE" reference for handling chunks of body content. This
               "CODE" reference will be invoked with no arguments once the end of the request has been  reached,
               and whatever it returns will be used as the result of the returned "Future", if there is one.

                  $on_body_chunk = $on_header-&gt;( $header );

                     $on_body_chunk-&gt;( $data );
                     $response = $on_body_chunk-&gt;();

       on_error =&gt; CODE
               A  callback  that  is  invoked  if an error occurs while trying to send the request or obtain the
               response. It will be passed an error message.

                  $on_error-&gt;( $message );

               If this is invoked because of a received "4xx" or "5xx" error code in an HTTP response,  it  will
               be invoked with the response and request objects as well.

                  $on_error-&gt;( $message, $response, $request );

   <b>GET,</b> <b>HEAD,</b> <b>PUT,</b> <b>...</b>
          $response = await $http-&gt;GET( $uri, %args );

          $response = await $http-&gt;HEAD( $uri, %args );

          $response = await $http-&gt;PUT( $uri, $content, %args );

          $response = await $http-&gt;POST( $uri, $content, %args );

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.36.</u>

          $response = await $http-&gt;PATCH( $uri, $content, %args );

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.48.</u>

          $response = await $http-&gt;DELETE( $uri, %args );

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.49.</u>

       Convenient  wrappers  for  performing  "GET",  "HEAD", "PUT", "POST", "PATCH" or "DELETE" requests with a
       "URI" object and few if any other arguments, returning a "Future".

       Remember that "POST" with non-form data (as indicated by a plain scalar instead of an  "ARRAY"  reference
       of form data name/value pairs) needs a "content_type" key in %args.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods are intended as points for subclasses to override, to add extra functionallity.

   <b>prepare_request</b>
          $http-&gt;prepare_request( $request );

       Called just before the "HTTP::Request" object is sent to the server.

   <b>process_response</b>
          $http-&gt;process_response( $response );

       Called  after  a  non-redirect "HTTP::Response" has been received from a server.  The originating request
       will be set in the object.

</pre><h4><b>CONTENT</b> <b>DECODING</b></h4><pre>
       If the required decompression modules are installed and available, compressed content can be decoded.  If
       the  received  "Content-Encoding"  is  recognised  and  the  required module is available, the content is
       transparently decoded and the decoded content is returned in the resulting response object, or passed  to
       the  data  chunk  handler.  In this case, the original "Content-Encoding" header will be deleted from the
       response, and its value will be available instead as "X-Original-Content-Encoding".

       The following content encoding types are recognised by these modules:

       •   gzip (q=0.7) and deflate (q=0.5)

           Recognised if Compress::Raw::Zlib version 2.057 or newer is installed.

       •   bzip2 (q=0.8)

           Recognised if Compress::Bzip2 version 2.10 or newer is installed.

       Other content encoding types can be registered by calling the following method

   <b>register_decoder</b>
          Net::Async::HTTP-&gt;register_decoder( $name, $q, $make_decoder )

       Registers an encoding type called $name, at the quality value $q. In order to decode this encoding  type,
       $make_decoder  will  be invoked with no paramters, and expected to return a CODE reference to perform one
       instance of decoding.

          $decoder = $make_decoder-&gt;()

       This decoder will be invoked on string buffers to decode them until the end of stream is reached, when it
       will be invoked with no arguments.

          $content = $decoder-&gt;( $encoded_content )
          $content = $decoder-&gt;() # EOS

   <b>Concurrent</b> <b>GET</b>
       The "Future"-returning "GET" method makes  it  easy  to  await  multiple  URLs  at  once,  by  using  the
       Future::Utils "fmap_void" utility

          use Future::AsyncAwait;
          use Future::Utils qw( fmap_void );

          my @URLs = ( ... );

          my $http = Net::Async::HTTP-&gt;new( ... );
          $loop-&gt;add( $http );

          my $future = fmap_void {
             my ( $url ) = @_;
             $http-&gt;GET( $url )
                  -&gt;on_done( sub {
                     my $response = shift;
                     say "$url succeeded: ", $response-&gt;code;
                     say "  Content-Type:", $response-&gt;content_type;
                  } )
                  -&gt;on_fail( sub {
                     my $failure = shift;
                     say "$url failed: $failure";
                  } );
          } foreach =&gt; \@URLs,
            concurrent =&gt; 5;

          await $future;
