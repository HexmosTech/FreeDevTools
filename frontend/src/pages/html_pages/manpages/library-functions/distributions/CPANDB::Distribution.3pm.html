</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPANDB::Distribution - CPANDB class for the distribution table

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       TO BE COMPLETED

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>base</b>
         # Returns 'CPANDB'
         my $namespace = CPANDB::Distribution-&gt;base;

       Normally you will only need to work directly with a table class, and only with one ORLite package.

       However, if for some reason you need to work with multiple ORLite packages at the same time without
       hardcoding the root namespace all the time, you can determine the root namespace from an object or table
       class with the "base" method.

   <b>table</b>
         # Returns 'distribution'
         print CPANDB::Distribution-&gt;table;

       While you should not need the name of table for any simple operations, from time to time you may need it
       programatically. If you do need it, you can use the "table" method to get the table name.

   <b>load</b>
         my $object = CPANDB::Distribution-&gt;load( $distribution );

       If your table has single column primary key, a "load" method will be generated in the class. If there is
       no primary key, the method is not created.

       The "load" method provides a shortcut mechanism for fetching a single object based on the value of the
       primary key. However it should only be used for cases where your code trusts the record to already
       exists.

       It returns a "CPANDB::Distribution" object, or throws an exception if the object does not exist.

   <b>select</b>
         # Get all objects in list context
         my @list = CPANDB::Distribution-&gt;select;

         # Get a subset of objects in scalar context
         my $array_ref = CPANDB::Distribution-&gt;select(
             'where distribution &gt; ? order by distribution',
             1000,
         );

       The "select" method executes a typical SQL "SELECT" query on the distribution table.

       It takes an optional argument of a SQL phrase to be added after the "FROM distribution" section of the
       query, followed by variables to be bound to the placeholders in the SQL phrase. Any SQL that is
       compatible with SQLite can be used in the parameter.

       Returns a list of <b>CPANDB::Distribution</b> objects when called in list context, or a reference to an "ARRAY"
       of <b>CPANDB::Distribution</b> objects when called in scalar context.

       Throws an exception on error, typically directly from the DBI layer.

   <b>iterate</b>
         CPANDB::Distribution-&gt;iterate( sub {
             print $_-&gt;distribution . "\n";
         } );

       The "iterate" method enables the processing of large tables one record at a time without loading having
       to them all into memory in advance.

       This plays well to the strength of SQLite, allowing it to do the work of loading arbitrarily large stream
       of records from disk while retaining the full power of Perl when processing the records.

       The last argument to "iterate" must be a subroutine reference that will be called for each element in the
       list, with the object provided in the topic variable $_.

       This makes the "iterate" code fragment above functionally equivalent to the following, except with an
       <a href="../man1/O.1.html">O</a>(1) memory cost instead of O(n).

         foreach ( CPANDB::Distribution-&gt;select ) {
             print $_-&gt;distribution . "\n";
         }

       You can filter the list via SQL in the same way you can with "select".

         CPANDB::Distribution-&gt;iterate(
             'order by ?', 'distribution',
             sub {
                 print $_-&gt;distribution . "\n";
             }
         );

       You can also use it in raw form from the root namespace for better control.  Using this form also allows
       for the use of arbitrarily complex queries, including joins. Instead of being objects, rows are provided
       as "ARRAY" references when used in this form.

         CPANDB-&gt;iterate(
             'select name from distribution order by distribution',
             sub {
                 print $_-&gt;[0] . "\n";
             }
         );

   <b>count</b>
         # How many objects are in the table
         my $rows = CPANDB::Distribution-&gt;count;

         # How many objects
         my $small = CPANDB::Distribution-&gt;count(
             'where distribution &gt; ?',
             1000,
         );

       The "count" method executes a "SELECT COUNT(*)" query on the distribution table.

       It takes an optional argument of a SQL phrase to be added after the "FROM distribution" section of the
       query, followed by variables to be bound to the placeholders in the SQL phrase. Any SQL that is
       compatible with SQLite can be used in the parameter.

       Returns the number of objects that match the condition.

       Throws an exception on error, typically directly from the DBI layer.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESSORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>distribution</b>
         if ( $object-&gt;distribution ) {
             print "Object has been inserted\n";
         } else {
             print "Object has not been inserted\n";
         }

       Returns true, or throws an exception on error.

       REMAINING ACCESSORS TO BE COMPLETED

</pre><h4><b>SQL</b></h4><pre>
       The distribution table was originally created with the following SQL command.

         CREATE TABLE distribution (
             distribution TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
             version TEXT NULL,
             author TEXT NOT NULL,
             meta INTEGER NOT NULL,
             license TEXT NULL,
             release TEXT NOT NULL,
             uploaded TEXT NULL,
             pass INTEGER NULL,
             fail INTEGER NULL,
             unknown INTEGER NULL,
             na INTEGER NULL,
             rating TEXT NULL,
             ratings INTEGER NOT NULL,
             weight INTEGER NOT NULL,
             volatility INTEGER NOT NULL,
             FOREIGN KEY (author) REFERENCES author (author)
         )
