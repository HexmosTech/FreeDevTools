</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPAN::Meta::History - history of CPAN Meta Spec changes

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.150010

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The CPAN Meta Spec has gone through several iterations.  It was originally written in HTML and later
       revised into POD (though published in HTML generated from the POD).  Fields were added, removed or
       changed, sometimes by design and sometimes to reflect real-world usage after the fact.

       This document reconstructs the history of the CPAN Meta Spec based on change logs, repository commit
       messages and the published HTML files.  In some cases, particularly prior to version 1.2, the exact
       version when certain fields were introduced or changed is inconsistent between sources.  When in doubt,
       the published HTML files for versions 1.0 to 1.4 as they existed when version 2 was developed are used as
       the definitive source.

       Starting with version 2, the specification document is part of the CPAN-Meta distribution and will be
       published on CPAN as CPAN::Meta::Spec.

       Going forward, specification version numbers will be integers and decimal portions will correspond to a
       release date for the CPAN::Meta library.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Version</b> <b>2</b>
       April 2010

       •   Revised spec examples as perl data structures rather than YAML

       •   Switched to JSON serialization from YAML

       •   Specified allowed version number formats

       •   Replaced  'requires',  'build_requires',  'configure_requires', 'recommends' and 'conflicts' with new
           'prereqs' data structure divided by <u>phase</u> (configure, build, test, runtime,  etc.)  and  <u>relationship</u>
           (requires, recommends, suggests, conflicts)

       •   Added support for 'develop' phase for requirements for maintaining a list of authoring tools

       •   Changed 'license' to a list and revised the set of valid licenses

       •   Made 'dynamic_config' mandatory to reduce confusion

       •   Changed  'resources'  subkey  'repository' to a hash that clarifies repository type, url for browsing
           and url for checkout

       •   Changed 'resources' subkey 'bugtracker' to a hash for either web or mailto resource

       •   Changed specification of 'optional_features':

           •   Added formal specification and usage guide instead of just example

           •   Changed to use new prereqs data structure instead of individual keys

       •   Clarified intended use of 'author' as generalized contact list

       •   Added 'release_status' field to indicate stable, testing or  unstable  status  to  provide  hints  to
           indexers

       •   Added 'description' field for a longer description of the distribution

       •   Formalized use of "x_" or "X_" for all custom keys not listed in the official spec

   <b>Version</b> <b>1.4</b>
       June 2008

       •   Noted explicit support for 'perl' in prerequisites

       •   Added 'configure_requires' prerequisite type

       •   Changed 'optional_features'

           •   Example corrected to show map of maps instead of list of maps (though descriptive text said 'map'
               even in v1.3)

           •   Removed 'requires_packages', 'requires_os' and 'excluded_os' as valid subkeys

   <b>Version</b> <b>1.3</b>
       November 2006

       •   Added 'no_index' subkey 'directory' and removed 'dir' to match actual usage in the wild

       •   Changed 'license' to be mandatory

       •   Added version range specifications for prerequisites

       •   Added required 'abstract' field

       •   Added required 'author' field

       •   Added  required  'meta-spec'  field  to  define  'version' (and 'url') of the CPAN Meta Spec used for
           metadata

       •   Added 'provides' field

       •   Added 'no_index' field and deprecated 'private' field.  'no_index'  subkeys  include  'file',  'dir',
           'package' and 'namespace'

       •   Added 'keywords' field

       •   Added 'resources' field with subkeys 'homepage', 'license', and 'bugtracker'

           'requires', 'build_requires', 'conflicts', 'requires_packages', 'requires_os'  and  'excluded_os'  as
           valid subkeys
