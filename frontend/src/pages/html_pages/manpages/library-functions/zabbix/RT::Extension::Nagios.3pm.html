       RT::Extension::Nagios - Merge and resolve Nagios tickets

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Nagios &lt;<a href="http://www.nagios.org">http://www.nagios.org</a>&gt; is a powerful monitoring system that enables organizations to identify and
       resolve IT infrastructure problems before they affect critical business processes.

       This extension allows email alerts generated by Nagios to be aggregated and resolved as it generates
       them.  It does this by examining the standard subject line that Nagios generates; by default, these take
       the form:

           PROBLEM Service Alert: localhost/Root Partition is WARNING

       There are 5 useful parts in subject; we call them "type", "category", "host", "problem_type" and
       "problem_severity".  These are parsed from the subject via a regular expression; in the above example,
       the extension would extract:

           type:             PROBLEM
           category:         Service
           host:             localhost
           problem_type:     Root Partition
           problem_severity: WARNING

       After the new ticket is created, the following is done:

       1.  Find  all  the  other active tickets in the same queue with the same values of "category", "host" and
           "problem_type".  If the configuration setting "NagiosSearchAllQueues" is set (see below), all  queues
           are searched.

       2.  If the configuration setting "NagiosMergeTickets" is set (see below), merge all matching tickets.

       3.  If "type" is 'RECOVERY', resolve them.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       "perl Makefile.PL"
       "make"
       "make install"
           May need root permissions

       "make initdb"
           Only run this the first time you install this module.

           If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your database.

           If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions in case changes need to be made to
           your database.

       Edit your <u>/opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm</u>
           If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

               Plugin('RT::Extension::Nagios');

           For RT 4.0, add this line:

               Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::Nagios));

           or add "RT::Extension::Nagios" to your existing @Plugins line.

       Restart your webserver

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       This extension has three configuration settings; setting them should be done in "RT_SiteConfig.pm".

       "NagiosSearchAllQueues"
           If  set,  this  causes  step  1,  above,  to search for matching Nagios tickets in an queue.  In most
           configurations, Nagios notifications will arrive in one queue, and remain there.   If  your  workflow
           involves triaging Nagios notifications from there into other queues, you will want to set:

              Set( $NagiosSearchAllQueues, 1 );

       "NagiosMergeTickets"
           Controls  if  the  extensions  merges  tickets  about  the  same incident together.  By default, each
           "PROBLEM", "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", "FLAPPINGSTART", "FLAPPINGSTOP" and "RECOVERY" notification will remain
           as its own ticket; when the "RECOVERY" email is received by RT, all will be resolved.

           Setting this configuration parameter to 1 causes the extension to merge all old tickets on  the  same
           topic  into  new  tickets  as  they  arrive; as such, the "Created" date will respect the most recent
           message.

           Setting it to "-1" causes the extension to merge new  tickets  into  any  existing  tickets  as  they
           arrive; the "Created" date will respect the oldest message, and the ticket ID will remain constant:

               Set( $NagiosMergeTickets, -1 );

       "NagiosResolvedStatus"
           Since  RT  allows  for  custom  lifecycles  on queues, this extension's default of setting tickets to
           "Resolved" upon "RECOVERY" may be incorrect for the queue they are in.   If  the  queue  your  Nagios
           tickets  reside in does not have a "Resolved" status, or you would like tickets to be transitioned to
           a different status on "RECOVERY", set "NagiosResolvedStatus":

               Set( $NagiosResolvedStatus, 'recovered' );
