</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tree::Simple::Visitor::LoadClassHierarchy - A Visitor for loading class hierarchies into a Tree::Simple
       hierarchy

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Tree::Simple::Visitor::LoadClassHierarchy;

         # create an visitor
         my $visitor = Tree::Simple::Visitor::LoadClassHierarchy-&gt;new();

         # set class as an instance, or
         $visitor-&gt;setClass($class);

         # as a package name
         $visitor-&gt;setClass("My::Class");

         # pass our visitor to the tree
         $tree-&gt;accept($visitor);

         # the $tree now mirrors the inheritance hierarchy of the $class

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This visitor will traverse a class's inheritance hierarchy (through the @ISA arrays) and create a
       Tree::Simple hierarchy which mirrors it.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>new</b> There  are  no  arguments to the constructor the object will be in its default state. You can use the
           "setNodeFilter" method to customize its behavior.

       <b>includeTrunk</b> <b>($boolean)</b>
           Setting the $boolean value to true (1) will cause the node value of  the  $tree  object  passed  into
           "visit"  to  be set with the root value found in the class hierarchy. Setting it to false (0), or not
           setting it, will result in the first value in the class hierarchy creating a new node level.

       <b>includeMethods</b> <b>($boolean)</b>
           Setting the $boolean value to true (1) will cause methods to be added as  a  children  of  the  class
           node. Setting it to false (0), or not setting it, will result in this not happening.

           <b>NOTE:</b>  Methods  are  sorted  ascii-betically  before  they  are added to the tree. This allows a more
           predictable hierarchy.

       <b>setClass</b> <b>($class)</b>
           The argument $class should be either a class name or an instance, it is then used as  the  root  from
           which to determine the class hierarchy.

       <b>setNodeFilter</b> <b>($filter_function)</b>
           This  method  accepts a CODE reference as its $filter_function argument and throws an exception if it
           is not a code reference. This code reference is used to filter the tree nodes as  they  are  created,
           the $filter_function is passed the node value extracted from the hash prior to it being inserted into
           the tree being built. The $filter_function is expected to return the value desired for inclusion into
           the tree.

       <b>visit</b> <b>($tree)</b>
           This is the method that is used by Tree::Simple's "accept" method. It can also be used on its own, it
           requires  the $tree argument to be a Tree::Simple object (or derived from a Tree::Simple object), and
           will throw and exception otherwise.

           The $tree argument which is passed to "visit" must be a leaf node. This is because this Visitor  will
           create  all the sub-nodes for this tree. If the tree is not a leaf, an exception is thrown. We do not
           require the tree to be a root though, and this Visitor will not affect  any  nodes  above  the  $tree
           argument.

</pre><h4><b>TO</b> <b>DO</b></h4><pre>
       Improve the "includeMethods" functionality
           I am not sure the tree this creates is the optimal tree for this situation. It is sufficient for now,
           until I have more of an <u>actual</u> need for this functionality.

       Add "includeFullSymbolTable" functionality
           This  would  traverse the full symbol tables and produce a detailed tree of everything it finds. This
           takes a lot more work, and as I have no current need for it, it remains in the TO DO list.

       See the <b>CODE</b> <b>COVERAGE</b> section in Tree::Simple::VisitorFactory for more information.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       These Visitor classes are all subclasses of <b>Tree::Simple::Visitor</b>, which can be found in the <b>Tree::Simple</b>
       module, you should refer to that module for more information.
