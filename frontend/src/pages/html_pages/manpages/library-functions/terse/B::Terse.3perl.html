</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       B::Terse - Walk Perl syntax tree, printing terse info about ops

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               perl -MO=Terse[,OPTIONS] foo.pl

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module prints the contents of the parse tree, but without as much information as CPAN module
       B::Debug.  For comparison, "print "Hello, world.""  produced 96 lines of output from B::Debug, but only 6
       from B::Terse.

       This module is useful for people who are writing their own back end, or who are learning about the Perl
       internals.  It's not useful to the average programmer.

       This version of B::Terse is really just a wrapper that calls B::Concise with the <b>-terse</b> option. It is
       provided for compatibility with old scripts (and habits) but using B::Concise directly is now recommended
       instead.

       For compatibility with the old B::Terse, this module also adds a method named "terse" to B::OP and B::SV
       objects. The B::SV method is largely compatible with the old one, though authors of new software might be
       advised to choose a more user-friendly output format. The B::OP "terse" method, however, doesn't work
       well. Since B::Terse was first written, much more information in OPs has migrated to the scratchpad
       datastructure, but the "terse" interface doesn't have any way of getting to the correct pad. As a kludge,
       the new version will always use the pad for the main program, but for OPs in subroutines this will give
       the wrong answer or crash.
