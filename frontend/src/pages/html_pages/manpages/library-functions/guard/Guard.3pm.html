       Guard - safe cleanup blocks

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use Guard;

          # temporarily chdir to "<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>" directory, but make sure
          # to go back to "/" no matter how myfun exits:
          sub myfun {
             scope_guard { chdir "/" };
             chdir "<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>";

             code_that_might_die_or_does_other_fun_stuff;
          }

          # create an object that, when the last reference to it is gone,
          # invokes the given codeblock:
          my $guard = guard { print "destroyed!\n" };
          undef $guard; # probably destroyed here

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements so-called "guards". A guard is something (usually an object) that "guards" a
       resource, ensuring that it is cleaned up when expected.

       Specifically, this module supports two different types of guards: guard objects, which execute a given
       code block when destroyed, and scoped guards, which are tied to the scope exit.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This module currently exports the "scope_guard" and "guard" functions by default.

       scope_guard BLOCK
       scope_guard ($coderef)
           Registers  a  block  that  is executed when the current scope (block, function, method, eval etc.) is
           exited.

           See the EXCEPTIONS section for an explanation of how exceptions (i.e. "die") are handled inside guard
           blocks.

           The description below sounds a bit complicated, but that's just because "scope_guard"  tries  to  get
           even corner cases "right": the goal is to provide you with a rock solid clean up tool.

           The behaviour is similar to this code fragment:

              eval ... code following scope_guard ...
              {
                 local $@;
                 eval BLOCK;
                 eval { $Guard::DIED-&gt;() } if $@;
              }
              die if $@;

           Except it is much faster, and the whole thing gets executed even when the BLOCK calls "exit", "goto",
           "last" or escapes via other means.

           If  multiple  BLOCKs  are registered to the same scope, they will be executed in reverse order. Other
           scope-related things such as "local" are managed via the same  mechanism,  so  variables  "local"ised
           <u>after</u> calling "scope_guard" will be restored when the guard runs.

           Example:  temporarily change the timezone for the current process, ensuring it will be reset when the
           "if" scope is exited:

              use Guard;
              use POSIX ();

              if ($need_to_switch_tz) {
                 # make sure we call tzset after $ENV{TZ} has been restored
                 scope_guard { POSIX::tzset };

                 # localise after the scope_guard, so it gets undone in time
                 local $ENV{TZ} = "Europe/London";
                 POSIX::tzset;

                 # do something with the new timezone
              }

       my $guard = guard BLOCK
       my $guard = guard ($coderef)
           Behaves the same as "scope_guard", except that instead of executing  the  block  on  scope  exit,  it
           returns  an object whose lifetime determines when the BLOCK gets executed: when the last reference to
           the object gets destroyed, the BLOCK gets executed as with "scope_guard".

           See the EXCEPTIONS section for an explanation of how exceptions (i.e. "die") are handled inside guard
           blocks.

           Example: acquire a Coro::Semaphore for a second by registering a timer. The timer callback references
           the guard used to unlock it again. (Please ignore the  fact  that  "Coro::Semaphore"  has  a  "guard"
           method that does this already):

              use Guard;
              use Coro::AnyEvent;
              use Coro::Semaphore;

              my $sem = new Coro::Semaphore;

              sub lock_for_a_second {
                 $sem-&gt;down;
                 my $guard = guard { $sem-&gt;up };

                 Coro::AnyEvent::sleep 1;

                 # $sem-&gt;up gets executed when returning
              }

           The  advantage  of  doing this with a guard instead of simply calling "$sem-&gt;down" in the callback is
           that you can opt not to create the timer, or your code can throw an exception before  it  can  create
           the  timer  (or  the thread gets canceled), or you can create multiple timers or other event watchers
           and only when the last one gets executed will the lock be unlocked. Using the  "guard",  you  do  not
           have to worry about catching all the places where you have to unlock the semaphore.

       $guard-&gt;cancel
           Calling  this function will "disable" the guard object returned by the "guard" function, i.e. it will
           free the BLOCK originally passed to "guard "and will arrange for the BLOCK not to be executed.

           This can be useful when you use "guard" to  create  a  cleanup  handler  to  be  called  under  fatal
           conditions and later decide it is no longer needed.

</pre><h4><b>EXCEPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Guard  blocks  should not normally throw exceptions (that is, "die"). After all, they are usually used to
       clean up after such exceptions. However, if something truly  exceptional  is  happening,  a  guard  block
       should  of  course  be allowed to die. Also, programming errors are a large source of exceptions, and the
       programmer certainly wants to know about those.

       Since in most cases, the block executing when the guard gets executed does not  know  or  does  not  care
       about the guard blocks, it makes little sense to let containing code handle the exception.

       Therefore,  whenever  a  guard block throws an exception, it will be caught by Guard, followed by calling
       the code reference stored in $Guard::DIED (with $@ set to the actual exception), which is similar to  how
       most event loops handle this case.

       The  default  for  $Guard::DIED  is  to  call "warn "$@"", i.e. the error is printed as a warning and the
       program continues.

       The $@ variable will be restored to its value before the guard call in all  cases,  so  guards  will  not
       disturb $@ in any way.

       The code reference stored in $Guard::DIED should not die (behaviour is not guaranteed, but right now, the
       exception will simply be ignored).

       Thanks to Marco Maisenhelder, who reminded me of the $Guard::DIED solution to the problem of exceptions.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Scope::Guard  and  Sub::ScopeFinalizer,  which actually implement dynamically scoped guards only, not the
       lexically scoped guards that their documentation promises, and have a lot higher CPU, memory  and  typing
       overhead.

       Hook::Scope, which has apparently never been finished and can corrupt memory when used.

       Scope::Guard seems to have a big SEE ALSO section for even more modules like it.
