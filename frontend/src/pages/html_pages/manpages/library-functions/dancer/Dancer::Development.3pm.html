       This guide has been written to help anyone interested in contributing to the development of Dancer.

       First of all - thank you for your interest in the project!  It's the community of helpful contributors
       who've helped Dancer experience phenomenal growth to get to where it is today.

       Please read this guide before contributing to Dancer, to avoid wasted effort and maximizing the chances
       of your contributions being used.

</pre><h4><b>WAYS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>CONTRIBUTE</b></h4><pre>
       There are many ways to contribute to the project. Dancer is a young yet active project and any kind of
       help is very much appreciated!

   <b>Publicity</b>
       You don't have to start by hacking the code, spreading the word is very valuable as well!

       If you have a blog, just feel free to speak about Dancer.

       If you're a Twitter user, you can tweet about it with the hashtag "#perl" (and feel free to follow
       @PerlDancer for news and updates on Dancer!).

       Of course, it doesn't have to be limited to blogs or Twitter.  Feel free to spread the word in whatever
       way you consider fit and drop us a line on the Dancer user mailing list noted below.

       Also, if you're using and enjoying Dancer, rating us on cpanratings.perl.org
       &lt;<a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/Dancer">http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/Dancer</a>&gt;, explaining what you like about Dancer is another very valuable
       contribution that helps other new users find us!

   <b>Mailing</b> <b>list</b> <b>/</b> <b>IRC</b> <b>community</b>
       Subscribing to the mailing list and/or hanging out on our IRC channel and providing assistance to new
       users is incredibly valuable.

       •   Mailing   list:  &lt;<a href="http://lists.preshweb.co.uk/mailman/listinfo/dancer-users">http://lists.preshweb.co.uk/mailman/listinfo/dancer-users</a>&gt;  to  subscribe  or  view
           archives

       •   IRC: "#dancer" on "irc.perl.org", or &lt;<a href="http://www.perldancer.org/irc">http://www.perldancer.org/irc</a>&gt; for a quick web client.

   <b>Documentation</b>
       While we value documentation very much, it's difficult to keep it up-to-date.  If you find a typo  or  an
       error  in  the  documentation  please  do  let us know - ideally by submitting a patch with your fix (see
       "Patch Submission").

   <b>Contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>CPAN</b> <b>Testers</b>
       If you have  access  to  perl  on  rare  operating  systems,  please  consider  contributing  tests.  See
       &lt;<a href="http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/TestDuringInstall">http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/TestDuringInstall</a>&gt; for more information.

   <b>Code</b>
       You  can  write  extensions  (plugins)  for Dancer extending Dancer's core functionality or contribute to
       Dancer's core code, see "Patch Submission" below.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>DEVELOPMENT</b> <b>GUIDELINES</b></h4><pre>
       This section lists high-level recommendations for developing Dancer, for more  detailed  guidelines,  see
       "Coding Guidelines" below.

   <b>Quality</b> <b>Assurance</b>
       Dancer  should be able to install for all Perl versions since 5.8, on any platform for which Perl exists.
       We focus mainly on GNU/Linux (any distribution), *BSD and Windows (native and Cygwin).

       We should avoid  regressions  as  much  as  possible  and  keep  backwards  compatibility  in  mind  when
       refactoring.  Stable  releases  should not break functionality and new releases should provide an upgrade
       path and upgrade tips such as warning the user about deprecated functionality.

   <b>Quality</b> <b>Supervision</b>
       We can measure our quality using the CPAN testers platform: &lt;<a href="http://www.cpantesters.org">http://www.cpantesters.org</a>&gt;.

       A  good  way  to  help  the  project  is  to  find  a  failing   build   log   on   the   CPAN   testers:
       &lt;<a href="http://www.cpantesters.org/distro/D/Dancer.html">http://www.cpantesters.org/distro/D/Dancer.html</a>&gt;

       If   you   find   a   failing   test   report,   feel   free   to   report   it   as   a   GitHub  issue:
       &lt;https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues&gt;.

   <b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b>
       We   prefer   to   have   all   our    bug    reports    on    GitHub,    in    the    issues    section:
       &lt;https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer/issues&gt;.  It's  possible  though  to  report  bugs  on  RT as well:
       &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=Dancer&gt;

       Please make sure the bug you're reporting does not yet exist. In doubt please ask on IRC.

   <b>Patch</b> <b>Submission</b>
       The Dancer development team uses GitHub to collaborate.  We greatly  appreciate  contributions  submitted
       via GitHub, as it makes tracking these contributions and applying them much, much easier. This gives your
       contribution a much better chance of being integrated into Dancer quickly!

       To help us achieve high-quality, stable releases, git-flow workflow is used to handle pull-requests, that
       means  contributors  must  work on their "devel" branch rather than on their "master".  (Master should be
       touched only by the core dev team when preparing a release to CPAN; all ongoing  development  happens  in
       branches which are merged to the "devel" branch.)

       Here is the workflow for submitting a patch:

       •   Fork the repository &lt;https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer&gt; (click "Fork")

       •   Clone your fork to have a local copy using the following command:

               $ git clone git://github.com/myname/Dancer.git

       •   As  a  contributor, you should <b>always</b> work on the "devel" branch of your clone ("master" is used only
           for building releases).

               $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer.git
               $ git fetch upstream
               $ git checkout -b devel upstream/devel

           This will create a local branch in your clone named "devel" and that will track the official  "devel"
           branch.  That  way,  if  you  have more or less commits than the upstream repo, you'll be immediately
           notified by git.

       •   You want to isolate all your commits in a <u>topic</u> branch, this will make the reviewing much easier  for
           the  core  team and will allow you to continue working on your clone without worrying about different
           commits mixing together.

           To do that, first create a local branch to build your pull request:

               # you should be in devel here
               git checkout -b pr/$name

           Now you have created a local branch named <u>pr/$name</u> where <u>$name</u>  is  the  name  you  want  (it  should
           describe the purpose of the pull request you're preparing).

           In  that  branch, do all the commits you need (the more the better) and when done, push the branch to
           your fork:

               # ... commits ...
               git push origin pr/$name

           You are now ready to send a pull request.

       •   Send a <u>pull</u> <u>request</u> via the GitHub interface. Make sure your pull request is based  on  the  <u>pr/$name</u>
           branch you've just pushed, so that it incorporates the appropriate commits only.

           It's  also a good idea to summarize your work in a report sent to the users mailing list (see below),
           in order to make sure the team is aware of it.

           You  could  also  notify  the  core  team  on  IRC,   on   "irc.perl.org",   channel   "#dancer"   or
           &lt;<a href="http://www.perldancer.org/irc">http://www.perldancer.org/irc</a>&gt;.

       •   When  the  core  team reviews your pull request, it will either accept (and then merge into <u>devel</u>) or
           refuse your request.

           If it's refused, try to understand the reasons explained by the team for  the  denial.  Most  of  the
           time,  communicating  with  the  core  team  is enough to understand what the mistake was. Above all,
           please don't be offended.

           If your pull-request is merged into <u>devel</u>, then all you have to do is to remove your local and remote
           <u>pr/$name</u> branch:

               git checkout devel
               git branch -D pr/$name
               git push origin :pr/$name

           And then, of course, you need to sync your local devel branch with the upstream:

               git pull upstream devel
               git push origin devel

           You're now ready to start working on a new pull request!

</pre><h4><b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>Release</b> <b>Cycle</b></h4><pre>
       Since version 1.2, the team has decided to take a step further toward  production  concerns:  Dancer  now
       promises  to  provide an API-stable and feature frozen release, whose updates will only be about bugfixes
       and documentation updates.

       After some discussion with the core-team members, it has been agreed that the 1.2xx release  series  will
       be the first of this kind, and will live as long as 1.3xx lives.

       As  soon  as the last 1.3xx release is mature enough and the core team is happy with, it will be uploaded
       as the first version of the 1.4xx series, and 1.2xx will become obsolete.

       This lets us evolve quickly in our main track (devel in GitHub will contain all the daily work we want to
       make 1.3xx better) but as well, it lets us assure maintainability for the 1.2 series, as we will probably
       have to fix a bug somewhere in 1.2 without merging with new stuff contained in the devel branch.

       That's why a maintenance branch is added to the repo. To be very clear, this branch is named "<u>frozen</u>", to
       reflect the idea that the source-code in this branch is not  meant  to  evolve  regarding  features.   It
       should only contains fixes for bug or documentation updates.

       If you want to submit a pull-request to the frozen branch (that means 1.3xx is out and you've found a bug
       in 1.2xx) you need to base your work on the "frozen" branch. Use the same procedure explained before, but
       with the "frozen" branch.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>DEVELOPERS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Mailing</b> <b>Lists</b>
       A mailing list is available here: &lt;<a href="http://lists.preshweb.co.uk/mailman/listinfo/dancer-users">http://lists.preshweb.co.uk/mailman/listinfo/dancer-users</a>&gt;

   <b>IRC</b> <b>Channels</b>
       You  can  reach  the  development  team  on  irc.perl.org, channel #dancer or via a web chat interface at
       &lt;<a href="http://www.perldancer.org/irc">http://www.perldancer.org/irc</a>&gt;.  We're always happy to hear from users and contributors.

   <b>Repositories</b>
       The    official    repository    is    hosted    on     GitHub     at     the     following     location:
       &lt;https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer&gt;.

       Official  developers  have  write  access to this repository, contributors are invited to fork it if they
       want to submit patches, as explained in the <u>Patch</u> <u>submission</u> section.

       The repository layout is organized as follows:

       •   "master"

           This branch is dedicated to prepare CPAN releases. We push to that branch only for  packaging  a  new
           release. Every CPAN version are made from this branch.

       •   "devel"

           This  is  the development branch. New features are pushed here, and will be merged to master when the
           next release is being prepared.

       <u>Working</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>devel</u> <u>branch</u>

       The distribution is managed with Dist::Zilla.  This means than many of the usual files you  might  expect
       are not in the repository, but are generated at release time.

       However, you can run tests directly using the 'prove' tool:

           $ prove -l
           $ prove -lv t/some_test_file.t
           $ prove -lvr t/

       In most cases, 'prove' is entirely sufficient for you to test any patches you have.

       You may need to satisfy some dependencies. The easiest way to satisfy dependencies is to install the last
       release -- this is available at &lt;https://metacpan.org/release/Dancer&gt;.

       If you use cpanminus, you can do it without downloading the tarball first:

           $ cpanm --reinstall --installdeps --with-recommends Dancer

       Dist::Zilla  is  a very powerful authoring tool, but requires a number of author-specific plugins. If you
       would like to use it for contributing, install it from CPAN, then run  one  of  the  following  commands,
       depending on your CPAN client:

           # with cpanminus
           $ dzil authordeps --missing | cpanm

           # with  cpan
           $ cpan `dzil authordeps --missing`

       You  should  then also install any additional requirements not needed by the dzil build but may be needed
       by tests or other development:

           # with cpanminus
           $ dzil listdeps --author --missing | cpanm

           # or just plain cpan...
           $ cpan `dzil listdeps --author --missing`

       You can also do this via cpanm directly:

           $ cpanm --reinstall --installdeps --with-develop --with-recommends Dancer

       Once installed, here are some dzil commands you might try:

       $ dzil build
           Build the code as it would appears on the final release.  The tarball of the new distribution will be
           present in  the  root  directory  of  the  repository,  and  a  called  "build/&lt;this_branch"&gt;,  where
           <u>this_branch</u>  is  the  current working branch, will also have the product of the dzillification of the
           code.

       $ dzil test
           Run all tests in <u>/t</u> against the built code.

       $ dzil xtest
           Run the author tests (in <u>/xt</u>) against the built code.

       $ dzil listdeps --json
           List all the dependencies, in JSON.

       $ dzil build --notgz
           Build the code, but don't generate the tarball.

       <u>This</u> <u>Is</u> <u>Complicated.</u> <u>Is</u> <u>There</u> <u>an</u> <u>Easier</u> <u>Way?</u>

       Actually, yes there is. You can also branch out directly from the <b>master</b> branch, which corresponds to the
       code is generated by Dist::Zilla and what is uploaded to CPAN.  It  won't  contain  any  of  the  changes
       brought to the codebase since the last CPAN release, but for a small patch that shouldn't be a problem.

</pre><h4><b>CODING</b> <b>GUIDELINES</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  describes  standards  and requirements for coding. For more broad guidelines, see "GENERAL
       DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES" above.

   <b>About</b> <b>Dependencies</b>
       Dancer is intended to be a  micro-framework.  That  means  among  other  things  that  it  should  remain
       lightweight.  For  this reason we try very hard to keep the dependencies as low as possible. On the other
       hand, we don't want to reinvent the wheel either.

       We not likely to accept a new dependency to the core unless there is a very good reason.

       If a patch provides a new feature that depends on a module, the solution is to perform a dynamic loading.
       Dancer has a class dedicated to that job: Dancer::ModuleLoader. Here is an example of how to use it:

           package Dancer::Some::Thing;
           use Carp;

           sub init {
               Dancer::ModuleLoader-&gt;load('Some::Deps')
                   or croak "the feature provided by Dancer::Some::Thing needs Some::Deps";
           }

       That way, an optional feature doesn't block Dancer from being installed since  the  dependency  check  is
       performed at runtime.

   <b>Tests</b>
</pre><h4><b>RELEASING</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Public</b> <b>Releases</b>
       Public  and stable releases are those without an underline ('_') in the version number. The latest stable
       release can be downloaded from CPAN and github.com.

   <b>Developer</b> <b>Releases</b>
       Developer releases are those which include an underline ('_') in the version number. Whenever  the  devel
       branch  has  been  merged into the master branch, the CPAN release built must be a developer version (the
       version number contains a '_').

       Before a new release is made, the uploaders must wait for the CPAN testers reports. This is done to  make
       sure the new merge doesn't bring regressions.

   <b>Roadmap</b>
       For    current   information   on   Dancer's   plans   for   the   future,   see   the   file   TODO   at
       &lt;https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer/blob/master/TODO&gt;.
