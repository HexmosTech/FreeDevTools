</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer::Plugins - interesting plugins to add to Dancer's capabilities

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.3521

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer aims to keep the core as small as possible, but there are a growing number of useful plugins to
       add helpful features.

       This document provides a quick summary of some recommended plugins.

</pre><h4><b>PLUGINS</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer::Plugin::Database
           Provides easy database access via DBI, reading the DB connection details from your app's config file,
           and  taking  care  of  ensuring  the  connection  is  still  valid and reconnecting if not (useful in
           persistent environments).  Just calling the "database" keyword gives  you  a  connected  and  working
           database  handle. It also provides some helpful keywords to make inserting/updating data as simple as
           it should be.

       Dancer::Plugin::DBIC
           Provides easy access to DBIx::Class database virtualization.

       Dancer::Plugin::Auth::RBAC
           Dancer Authentication, Security and Role-Based Access Control Framework.

       Dancer::Plugin::Email
           Provides easy email-sending powered by Email::Send - simply call the "email" keyword.  Email  sending
           settings can be taken from your app's config.

       Dancer::Plugin::SMS
           Send  SMS  text  messages  to  mobile  phones  from  your  Dancer app, using any service supported by
           SMS::Send.

       Dancer::Plugin::Ajax
           Provides easy way to add Ajax route handlers.

       Dancer::Plugin::REST
           Makes writing RESTful web services easy.

       Dancer::Plugin::SiteMap
           Automatically provides site maps (as an HTML page, or as an XML sitemap ready for  Google)  based  on
           the routes your app defines.

       Dancer::Plugin::Params::Normalization
           Provides different ways of normalizing parameter names

       Dancer::Plugin::SimpleCRUD
           Provides  easy  CRUD  (create,  read,  update,  delete)  facilities, automatically creating routes to
           display, add, edit and delete data from a database table.

       Dancer::Plugin::WebSocket
           Supports building apps using Web Sockets for bi-directional, full-duplex communications over a  long-
           lived socket connection.

       Dancer::Plugin::Memcached
           Cache page responses or individual items of data with memcached for performance.

       Dancer::Plugin::MobileDevice
           Quickly  determine  whether the client is a mobile browser, in order to offer a simplified layout, or
           otherwise customise features.

       Dancer::Plugin::NYTProf
           Provides dead-simple profiling of your app using Devel::NYTProf - enables profiling for each  request
           individually,  serves up a list of profiling runs, and generates &amp; sends the HTML reports produced by
           "nytprofhtml".

       Dancer::Plugin::Bcrypt
           Provides simple effective password hashing and validation using Bcrypt.

       Dancer::Plugin::Cache::CHI
           Provides caching for generated pages and/or arbitrary data.   Uses  CHI,  so  is  backend-agnostic  -
           caching can be done in memory, to files, using Memcache, in a database, or any other method for which
           there is a CHI::Driver module.

       Dancer::Plugin::Thumbnail
           Easy thumbnail generation using GD.

       Dancer::Plugin::Captcha::SecurityImage
           Easy CAPTCHA image generation and validation, using GD.

       Dancer::Plugin::Facebook
           Easily work with Facebook's Graph API from your Perl Dancer app.  Uses Facebook::Graph.

       Dancer::Plugin::Redis
           Easy Redis database connections, based upon Dancer::Plugin::Database.

       Dancer::Plugin::XML::RSS
           Easy XML RSS creation and consumption.

       More  plugins  are appearing on CPAN all the time - just search for "Dancer::Plugin" to see what may have
       been released since this document was last updated!
