</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer::Object - Objects base class for Dancer

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.3521

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package My::Dancer::Extension;

           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use base 'Dancer::Object';

           __PACKAGE__-&gt;attributes( qw/name value this that/ );

           sub init {
               # our initialization code, if we need one
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       While we <b>love</b> Moose, we can't use it for Dancer and still keep Dancer minimal, so we wrote Dancer::Object
       instead.

       It provides you with attributes and an initializer.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       Creates a new object of whatever is based off Dancer::Object. This is a generic "new" method so you don't
       have to write one yourself when extending "Dancer::Object".

       It accepts arguments in a hash and runs an additional "init" method (described below) which you should
       implement.

   <b>init</b>
       Exists but does nothing. This is so you won't have to write an initializer if you don't want to.

   <b>clone</b>
       Creates and returns a clone of the object using Clone, which is loaded dynamically. If we cannot load
       Clone, we throw an exception.

   <b>get_attributes</b>
       Get the attributes of the specific class.

   <b>attributes</b>
       Generates attributes for whatever object is extending Dancer::Object and saves them in an internal
       hashref so they can be later fetched using "get_attributes".

       For each defined attribute you can access its value using:

         $self-&gt;your_attribute_name;

       To set a value use

         $self-&gt;your_attribute_name($value);

       Nevertheless, you can continue to use these attributes as hash keys, as usual with blessed hash
       references:

         $self-&gt;{your_attribute_name} = $value;

       Although this is possible we defend you should use the method approach, as it maintains compatibility in
       case "Dancer::Object" structure changes in the future.

   <b>attributes_defaults</b>
         $self-&gt;attributes_defaults(length =&gt; 2);

       given a hash (not a hashref), makes sure an object has the given attributes default values. Usually
       called from within an "init" function.
