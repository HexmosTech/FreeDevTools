</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer - lightweight yet powerful web application framework

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.3521

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>
           use Dancer;

           get '/hello/:name' =&gt; sub {
               return "Why, hello there " . param('name');
           };

           dance;

       The above is a basic but functional web app created with Dancer.  If you want to see more examples and
       get up and running quickly, check out the Dancer::Introduction and the Dancer::Cookbook.  For examples on
       deploying your Dancer applications, see Dancer::Deployment.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer is a web application framework designed to be as effortless as possible for the developer, taking
       care of the boring bits as easily as possible, yet staying out of your way and letting you get on with
       writing your code.

       Dancer aims to provide the simplest way for writing web applications, and offers the flexibility to scale
       between a very simple lightweight web service consisting of a few lines of code in a single file, all the
       way up to a more complex fully-fledged web application with session support, templates for views and
       layouts, etc.

       If you don't want to write CGI scripts by hand, and find Catalyst too big or cumbersome for your project,
       Dancer is what you need.

       Dancer has few pre-requisites, so your Dancer webapps will be easy to deploy.

       Dancer apps can be used with an embedded web server (great for easy testing), and can run under
       PSGI/Plack for easy deployment in a variety of webserver environments.

</pre><h4><b>MORE</b> <b>DOCUMENTATION</b></h4><pre>
       This documentation describes all the exported symbols of Dancer. If you want a quick start guide to
       discover the framework, you should look at Dancer::Introduction, or Dancer::Tutorial to learn by example.

       If you want to have specific examples of code for real-life problems, see the Dancer::Cookbook.

       If you want to see configuration examples of different deployment solutions involving Dancer and Plack,
       see Dancer::Deployment.

       You can find out more about the many useful plugins available for Dancer in Dancer::Plugins.

</pre><h4><b>DANCER</b> <b>2</b></h4><pre>
       This is the original version of Dancer, which is now in maintenance mode.  This means that it will not
       receive significant new features, but will continue to receive bugfixes and security fixes.  However, no
       "end of life" date has been set, and it is expected that this version of Dancer will continue to receive
       bugfixes and security fixes for quite some time yet.

       However, you should consider migrating to Dancer2 instead when you can, and are advised to use Dancer2
       for newly-started apps.

       Dancer2 is mostly backwards compatible, but has been re-written from the ground up to be more
       maintainable and extensible, and is the future of Dancer.

       Dancer2::Manual::Migration covers the changes you should be aware of when migrating an existing Dancer 1
       powered app to Dancer 2.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       By default, "use Dancer" exports all the functions below plus sets up your app.  You can control the
       exporting through the normal Exporter mechanism.  For example:

           # Just export the route controllers
           use Dancer qw(get post put patch del);

           # Export everything but pass to avoid clashing with Test::More
           use Test::More;
           use Dancer qw(!pass);

       Please note that the utf8 and strict pragmas are exported by this module.

       By default, the warnings pragma will also be exported, meaning your app/script will be running under "use
       warnings".  If you do not want this, set the global_warnings setting to a false value.

       There are also some special tags to control exports and behaviour.

   <b>:moose</b>
       This will export everything except functions which clash with Moose. Currently these are "after" and
       "before".

   <b>:syntax</b>
       This tells Dancer to just export symbols and not set up your app.  This is most useful for writing Dancer
       code outside of your main route handler.

   <b>:tests</b>
       This will export everything except functions which clash with commonly used testing modules. Currently
       these are "pass".

       It can be combined with other export pragmas. For example, while testing...

           use Test::More;
           use Dancer qw(:syntax :tests);

           # Test::Most also exports "set" and "any"
           use Test::Most;
           use Dancer qw(:syntax :tests !set !any);

           # Alternatively, if you want to use Dancer's set and any...
           use Test::Most qw(!set !any);
           use Dancer qw(:syntax :tests);

   <b>:script</b>
       This will export all the keywords, load the configuration, and will not try to parse command-line
       arguments via Dancer::GetOpt.

       This is useful when you want to use your Dancer application from a script.

           use MyApp;
           use Dancer ':script';
           MyApp::schema('DBSchema')-&gt;deploy();

       Note that using ":script"  will disable command-line parsing for all subsequent invocations of "use
       Dancer" (such that you don't have to use ":script" for each and every module to make sure the command-
       line arguments don't get stolen by Dancer).

   <b>!keyword</b>
       If you want to simply prevent Dancer from exporting specific keywords (perhaps you plan to implement them
       yourself in a different way, or you don't plan to use them and they clash with another module you're
       loading), you can simply exclude them:

           use Dancer qw(!session);

       The above would import all keywords as normal, with the exception of "session".

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>after</b>
       Deprecated - see the "after" hook.

   <b>any</b>
       Defines a route for multiple HTTP methods at once:

           any ['get', 'post'] =&gt; '/myaction' =&gt; sub {
               # code
           };

       Or even, a route handler that would match any HTTP methods:

           any '/myaction' =&gt; sub {
               # code
           };

   <b>before</b>
       Deprecated - see the "before" hook.

   <b>before_template</b>
       Deprecated - see the "before_template" hook.

   <b>cookies</b>
       Accesses cookies values, it returns a HashRef of Dancer::Cookie objects:

           get '/some_action' =&gt; sub {
               my $cookie = cookies-&gt;{name};
               return $cookie-&gt;value;
           };

       In the case you have stored something other than a Scalar in your cookie:

           get '/some_action' =&gt; sub {
               my $cookie = cookies-&gt;{oauth};
               my %values = $cookie-&gt;value;
               return ($values{token}, $values{token_secret});
           };

   <b>cookie</b>
       Accesses a cookie value (or sets it). Note that this method will eventually be preferred over
       "set_cookie".

           cookie lang =&gt; "fr-FR";              # set a cookie and return its value
           cookie lang =&gt; "fr-FR", expires =&gt; "2 hours";   # extra cookie info
           cookie "lang"                        # return a cookie value

       If your cookie value is a key/value URI string, like

           token=ABC&amp;user=foo

       "cookie" will only return the first part ("token=ABC") if called in scalar context.  Use list context to
       fetch them all:

           my @values = cookie "name";

       Note that if the client has sent more than one cookie with the same value, the one returned will be the
       last one seen.  This should only happen if you have set multiple cookies with the same name but different
       paths. So, don't do that.

   <b>config</b>
       Accesses the configuration of the application:

           get '/appname' =&gt; sub {
               return "This is " . config-&gt;{appname};
           };

   <b>content_type</b>
       Sets the <b>content-type</b> rendered, for the current route handler:

           get '/cat/:txtfile' =&gt; sub {
               content_type 'text/plain';

               # here we can dump the contents of param('txtfile')
           };

       You can use abbreviations for content types. For instance:

           get '/svg/:id' =&gt; sub {
               content_type 'svg';

               # here we can dump the image with id param('id')
           };

       Note that if you want to change the default content-type for every route, you have to change the
       "content_type" setting instead.

   <b>dance</b>
       Alias for the "start" keyword.

   <b>dancer_version</b>
       Returns the version of Dancer. If you need the major version, do something like:

         int(dancer_version);

   <b>debug</b>
       Logs a message of debug level:

           debug "This is a debug message";

       See Dancer::Logger for details on how to configure where log messages go.

   <b>dirname</b>
       Returns the dirname of the path given:

           my $dir = dirname($some_path);

   <b>engine</b>
       Given a namespace, returns the current engine object

           my $template_engine = engine 'template';
           my $html = $template_engine-&gt;apply_renderer(...);
           $template_engine-&gt;apply_layout($html);

   <b>error</b>
       Logs a message of error level:

           error "This is an error message";

       See Dancer::Logger for details on how to configure where log messages go.

   <b>false</b>
       Constant that returns a false value (0).

   <b>forward</b>
       Runs an internal redirect of the current request to another request. This helps you avoid having to
       redirect the user using HTTP and set another request to your application.

       It effectively lets you chain routes together in a clean manner.

           get '/demo/articles/:article_id' =&gt; sub {

               # you'll have to implement this next sub yourself :)
               change_the_main_database_to_demo();

               forward "/articles/" . params-&gt;{article_id};
           };

       In the above example, the users that reach <u>/demo/articles/30</u> will actually reach <u>/articles/30</u> but we've
       changed the database to demo before.

       This is pretty cool because it lets us retain our paths and offer a demo database by merely going to
       <u>/demo/...</u>.

       You'll notice that in the example we didn't indicate whether it was <b>GET</b> or <b>POST</b>. That is because
       "forward" chains the same type of route the user reached. If it was a <b>GET</b>, it will remain a <b>GET</b> (but if
       you do need to change the method, you can do so; read on below for details.)

       <b>WARNING</b> : using forward will <b>not</b> preserve session data set on the forwarding rule.

       <b>WARNING</b> : Issuing a forward immediately exits the current route, and perform the forward. Thus, any code
       after a forward is ignored, until the end of the route. e.g.

           get '/foo/:article_id' =&gt; sub {
               if ($condition) {
                   forward "/articles/" . params-&gt;{article_id};
                   # The following code is never executed
                   do_stuff();
               }

               more_stuff();
           };

       So it's not necessary anymore to use "return" with forward.

       Note that forward doesn't parse GET arguments. So, you can't use something like:

            return forward '<a href="file:/home">/home</a>?authorized=1';

       But "forward" supports an optional HashRef with parameters to be added to the actual parameters:

            return forward '<a href="file:/home">/home</a>', { authorized =&gt; 1 };

       Finally, you can add some more options to the forward method, in a third argument, also as a HashRef.
       That option is currently only used to change the method of your request. Use with caution.

           return forward '<a href="file:/home">/home</a>', { auth =&gt; 1 }, { method =&gt; 'POST' };

   <b>from_dumper</b> <b>($structure)</b>
       Deserializes a Data::Dumper structure.

   <b>from_json</b> <b>($structure,</b> <b>\%options)</b>
       Deserializes a JSON structure. Can receive optional arguments. Those arguments are valid JSON arguments
       to change the behaviour of the default "JSON::from_json" function.

       Compatibility notice: "from_json" changed in 1.3002 to take a hashref as options, instead of a hash.

   <b>from_yaml</b> <b>($structure)</b>
       Deserializes a YAML structure.

   <b>from_xml</b> <b>($structure,</b> <b>%options)</b>
       Deserializes a XML structure. Can receive optional arguments. These arguments are valid XML::Simple
       arguments to change the behaviour of the default "XML::Simple::XMLin" function.

   <b>get</b>
       Defines a route for HTTP <b>GET</b> requests to the given path:

           get '/' =&gt; sub {
               return "Hello world";
           }

       Note that a route to match <b>HEAD</b> requests is automatically created as well.

   <b>halt</b>
       Sets a response object with the content given.

       When used as a return value from a filter, this breaks the execution flow and renders the response
       immediately:

           hook before sub {
               if ($some_condition) {
                   halt("Unauthorized");
                   # This code is not executed :
                   do_stuff();
               }
           };

           get '/' =&gt; sub {
               "hello there";
           };

       <b>WARNING</b> : Issuing a halt immediately exits the current route, and perform the halt. Thus, any code after
       a halt is ignored, until the end of the route.  So it's not necessary anymore to use "return" with halt.

   <b>headers</b>
       Adds custom headers to responses:

           get '/send/headers', sub {
               headers 'X-Foo' =&gt; 'bar', X-Bar =&gt; 'foo';
           }

   <b>header</b>
       adds a custom header to response:

           get '/send/header', sub {
               header 'x-my-header' =&gt; 'shazam!';
           }

       Note that it will overwrite the old value of the header, if any. To avoid that, see "push_header".

   <b>push_header</b>
       Do the same as "header", but allow for multiple headers with the same name.

           get '/send/header', sub {
               push_header 'x-my-header' =&gt; '1';
               push_header 'x-my-header' =&gt; '2';
               will result in two headers "x-my-header" in the response
           }

   <b>hook</b>
       Adds a hook at some position. For example :

         hook before_serializer =&gt; sub {
           my $response = shift;
           $response-&gt;content-&gt;{generated_at} = localtime();
         };

       There can be multiple hooks assigned to a given position, and each will be executed in order. Note that
       <b>all</b> hooks are always called, even if they are defined in a different package loaded via "load_app".

       (For details on how to register new hooks from within plugins, see Dancer::Hook.)  Supported <b>before</b> hooks
       (in order of execution):

       before_deserializer
           This hook receives no arguments.

             hook before_deserializer =&gt; sub {
               ...
             };

       before_file_render
           This hook receives as argument the path of the file to render.

             hook before_file_render =&gt; sub {
               my $path = shift;
               ...
             };

       before_error_init
           This hook receives as argument a Dancer::Error object.

             hook before_error_init =&gt; sub {
               my $error = shift;
               ...
             };

       before_error_render
           This hook receives as argument a Dancer::Error object.

             hook before_error_render =&gt; sub {
               my $error = shift;
             };

       before
           This hook receives one argument, the route being executed (a Dancer::Route object).

             hook before =&gt; sub {
               my $route_handler = shift;
               ...
             };

           it is equivalent to the deprecated

             before sub {
               ...
             };

       before_template_render
           This is an alias to 'before_template'.

           This  hook  receives as argument a HashRef containing the tokens that will be passed to the template.
           You can use it to add more tokens, or delete some specific token.

             hook before_template_render =&gt; sub {
               my $tokens = shift;
               delete $tokens-&gt;{user};
               $tokens-&gt;{time} = localtime;
             };

           is equivalent to

             hook before_template =&gt; sub {
               my $tokens = shift;
               delete $tokens-&gt;{user};
               $tokens-&gt;{time} = localtime;
             };

       before_layout_render
           This hook receives two arguments. The first one is a HashRef containing the tokens. The second  is  a
           ScalarRef representing the content of the template.

             hook before_layout_render =&gt; sub {
               my ($tokens, $html_ref) = @_;
               ...
             };

       before_serializer
           This hook receives as argument a Dancer::Response object.

             hook before_serializer =&gt; sub {
               my $response = shift;
               $response-&gt;content-&gt;{start_time} = time();
             };

       Supported <b>after</b> hooks (in order of execution):

       after_deserializer
           This hook receives no arguments.

             hook after_deserializer =&gt; sub {
               ...
             };

       after_file_render
           This hook receives as argument a Dancer::Response object.

             hook after_file_render =&gt; sub {
               my $response = shift;
             };

       after_template_render
           This hook receives as argument a ScalarRef representing the content generated by the template.

             hook after_template_render =&gt; sub {
               my $html_ref = shift;
             };

       after_layout_render
           This hook receives as argument a ScalarRef representing the content generated by the layout

             hook after_layout_render =&gt; sub {
               my $html_ref = shift;
             };

       after
           This is an alias for "after".

           This hook runs after a request has been processed, but before the response is sent.

           It  receives  a  Dancer::Response  object,  which  it  can  modify if it needs to make changes to the
           response which is about to be sent.

             hook after =&gt; sub {
               my $response = shift;
             };

           This is equivalent to the deprecated

             after sub {
               my $response = shift;
             };

       after_error_render
           This hook receives as argument a Dancer::Response object.

             hook after_error_render =&gt; sub {
               my $response = shift;
             };

       on_handler_exception
           This hook is called when an exception has been caught, at the handler level, just before creating and
           rendering Dancer::Error. This hook receives as argument a Dancer::Exception object.

             hook on_handler_exception =&gt; sub {
               my $exception = shift;
             };

       on_reset_state
           This hook is called when global state is reset to process a new request.  It receives a boolean value
           that indicates whether the reset was called as part of a forwarded request.

             hook on_reset_state =&gt; sub {
               my $is_forward = shift;
             };

       on_route_exception
           This hook is called when an exception has been caught, at the route level, just before rethrowing  it
           higher.  This hook receives the exception as argument. It can be a Dancer::Exception, or a string, or
           whatever was used to "die".

             hook on_route_exception =&gt; sub {
               my $exception = shift;
             };

   <b>info</b>
       Logs a message of info level:

           info "This is a info message";

       See Dancer::Logger for details on how to configure where log messages go.

   <b>layout</b>
       This method is deprecated. Use "set":

           set layout =&gt; 'user';

   <b>logger</b>
       Deprecated. Use "&lt;set logger =&gt; 'console'"&gt; to change current logger engine.

   <b>load</b>
       Loads one or more perl scripts in the current application's  namespace.  Syntactic  sugar  around  Perl's
       "require":

           load 'UserActions.pl', 'AdminActions.pl';

   <b>load_app</b>
       Loads a Dancer package. This method sets the libdir to the current ".<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>" directory:

           # if we have lib/Webapp.pm, we can load it like:
           load_app 'Webapp';
           # or with options
           load_app 'Forum', prefix =&gt; '/forum', settings =&gt; {foo =&gt; 'bar'};

       Note that the package loaded using load_app <b>must</b> import Dancer with the ":syntax" option.

       To load multiple apps repeat load_app:

           load_app 'one';
           load_app 'two';

       The old way of loading multiple apps in one go (load_app 'one', 'two';) is deprecated.

   <b>mime</b>
       Shortcut  to  access  the instance object of Dancer::MIME. You should read the Dancer::MIME documentation
       for full details, but the most commonly-used methods are summarized below:

           # set a new mime type
           mime-&gt;add_type( foo =&gt; 'text/foo' );

           # set a mime type alias
           mime-&gt;add_alias( f =&gt; 'foo' );

           # get mime type for an alias
           my $m = mime-&gt;for_name( 'f' );

           # get mime type for a file (based on extension)
           my $m = mime-&gt;for_file( "foo.bar" );

           # get current defined default mime type
           my $d = mime-&gt;default;

           # set the default mime type using config.yml
           # or using the set keyword
           set default_mime_type =&gt; 'text/plain';

   <b>params</b>
       <u>This</u> <u>method</u> <u>should</u> <u>be</u> <u>called</u> <u>from</u> <u>a</u>  <u>route</u>  <u>handler</u>.   It's  an  alias  for  the  Dancer::Request  params
       accessor.  In  list  context  it  returns  a  list of key/value pair of all defined parameters. In scalar
       context it returns a hash reference instead.  Check "param" below to access quickly to a single parameter
       value.

   <b>param</b>
       <u>This</u> <u>method</u> <u>should</u> <u>be</u> <u>called</u> <u>from</u> <u>a</u> <u>route</u> <u>handler</u>.  This method is an accessor  to  the  parameters  hash
       table.

          post '/login' =&gt; sub {
              my $username = param "user";
              my $password = param "pass";
              # ...
          }

   <b>param_array</b>
       <u>This</u> <u>method</u> <u>should</u> <u>be</u> <u>called</u> <u>from</u> <u>a</u> <u>route</u> <u>handler</u>.  Like <u>param</u>, but always returns the parameter value or
       values as a list.  Returns the number of values in scalar context.

           # if request is '/tickets?tag=open&amp;tag=closed&amp;order=desc'...
           get '/tickets' =&gt; sub {
               my @tags = param_array 'tag';  # ( 'open', 'closed' )
               my $tags = param 'tag';        # array ref

               my @order = param_array 'order';  # ( 'desc' )
               my $order = param 'order';        # 'desc'
           };

   <b>pass</b>
       <u>This</u> <u>method</u> <u>should</u> <u>be</u> <u>called</u> <u>from</u> <u>a</u> <u>route</u> <u>handler</u>.  Tells Dancer to pass the processing of the request to
       the next matching route.

       <b>WARNING</b> : Issuing a pass immediately exits the current route, and performs the pass. Thus, any code after
       a pass is ignored until the end of the route.  So it's not necessary any more to use "return" with pass.

           get '/some/route' =&gt; sub {
               if (...) {
                   # we want to let the next matching route handler process this one
                   pass(...);
                   # This code will be ignored
                   do_stuff();
               }
           };

   <b>patch</b>
       Defines a route for HTTP <b>PATCH</b> requests to the given URL:

           patch '/resource' =&gt; sub { ... };

       ("PATCH"  is a relatively new and not-yet-common HTTP verb, which is intended to work as a "partial-PUT",
       transferring just  the  changes;  please  see  &lt;<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789</a>|RFC5789&gt;  for  further
       details.)

       Please  be  aware  that, if you run your app in standalone mode, "PATCH" requests will not reach your app
       unless you have a new version of HTTP::Server::Simple which accepts "PATCH" as a valid verb.  The current
       version at time of writing, 0.44, does not.  A pull request has been submitted to add this support, which
       you can find at:

       &lt;https://github.com/bestpractical/http-server-simple/pull/1&gt;

   <b>path</b>
       Concatenates multiple paths together, without worrying about the underlying operating system:

           my $path = path(dirname($0), 'lib', 'File.pm');

       It also normalizes (cleans) the path aesthetically. It does not verify the path exists.

   <b>post</b>
       Defines a route for HTTP <b>POST</b> requests to the given URL:

           post '/' =&gt; sub {
               return "Hello world";
           }

   <b>prefix</b>
       Defines a prefix for each route handler, like this:

           prefix '<a href="file:/home">/home</a>';

       From here, any route handler is defined to <a href="file:/home/">/home/</a>*:

           get '/page1' =&gt; sub {}; # will match '/home/page1'

       You can unset the prefix value:

           prefix undef;
           get '/page1' =&gt; sub {}; will match /page1

       For a safer alternative you can use lexical prefix like this:

           prefix '<a href="file:/home">/home</a>' =&gt; sub {
               ## Prefix is set to '<a href="file:/home">/home</a>' here

               get ...;
               get ...;
           };
           ## prefix reset to the previous version here

       This makes it possible to nest prefixes:

          prefix '<a href="file:/home">/home</a>' =&gt; sub {
              ## some routes

             prefix '/private' =&gt; sub {
                ## here we are under /home/private...

                ## some more routes
             };
             ## back to <a href="file:/home">/home</a>
          };
          ## back to the root

       <b>Notice:</b> once you have a prefix set, do not add a caret to the regex:

           prefix '/foo';
           get qr{^/bar} =&gt; sub { ... } # BAD BAD BAD
           get qr{/bar}  =&gt; sub { ... } # Good!

   <b>del</b>
       Defines a route for HTTP <b>DELETE</b> requests to the given URL:

           del '/resource' =&gt; sub { ... };

   <b>options</b>
       Defines a route for HTTP <b>OPTIONS</b> requests to the given URL:

           options '/resource' =&gt; sub { ... };

   <b>put</b>
       Defines a route for HTTP <b>PUT</b> requests to the given URL:

           put '/resource' =&gt; sub { ... };

   <b>redirect</b>
       Generates an HTTP redirect (302).  You can either redirect to a completely different site or  within  the
       application:

           get '/twitter', sub {
               redirect '<a href="http://twitter.com/me">http://twitter.com/me</a>';
           };

       You can also force Dancer to return a specific 300-ish HTTP response code:

           get '/old/:resource', sub {
               redirect '/new/'.params-&gt;{resource}, 301;
           };

       It  is  important  to  note  that  issuing  a  redirect by itself does not exit and redirect immediately.
       Redirection is deferred until after the current route or filter has been processed. To exit and  redirect
       immediately, use the return function, e.g.

           get '/restricted', sub {
               return redirect '/login' if accessDenied();
               return 'Welcome to the restricted section';
           };

   <b>render_with_layout</b>
       Allows a handler to provide plain HTML (or other content), but have it rendered within the layout still.

       This method is <b>DEPRECATED</b>, and will be removed soon. Instead, you should be using the "engine" keyword:

           get '/foo' =&gt; sub {
               # Do something which generates HTML directly (maybe using
               # HTML::Table::FromDatabase or something)
               my $content = ...;

               # get the template engine
               my $template_engine = engine 'template';

               # apply the layout (not the renderer), and return the result
               $template_engine-&gt;apply_layout($content)
           };

       It  works  very  similarly  to  "template"  in  that you can pass tokens to be used in the layout, and/or
       options to control the way the layout is rendered.  For instance, to use a custom layout:

           render_with_layout $content, {}, { layout =&gt; 'layoutname' };

   <b>request</b>
       Returns a Dancer::Request object representing the current request.

       See the Dancer::Request documentation for the methods you can call, for example:

           request-&gt;referer;         # value of the HTTP referer header
           request-&gt;remote_address;  # user's IP address
           request-&gt;user_agent;      # User-Agent header value

   <b>send_error</b>
       Returns an HTTP error.  By default the HTTP code returned is 500:

           get '/photo/:id' =&gt; sub {
               if (...) {
                   send_error("Not allowed", 403);
               } else {
                  # return content
               }
           }

       <b>WARNING</b> : Issuing a send_error immediately exits the current route, and perform the send_error. Thus, any
       code after a send_error is ignored, until the end of the route.  So it's not  necessary  anymore  to  use
       "return" with send_error.

           get '/some/route' =&gt; sub {
               if (...) {
                   # we want to let the next matching route handler process this one
                   send_error(..);
                   # This code will be ignored
                   do_stuff();
               }
           };

   <b>send_file</b>
       Lets the current route handler send a file to the client. Note that the path of the file must be relative
       to the <b>public</b> directory unless you use the "system_path" option (see below).

           get '/download/:file' =&gt; sub {
               send_file(params-&gt;{file});
           }

       <b>WARNING</b>  : Issuing a send_file immediately exits the current route, and performs the send_file. Thus, any
       code after a send_file is ignored until the end of the route.  So it's not  necessary  any  more  to  use
       "return" with send_file.

           get '/some/route' =&gt; sub {
               if (...) {
                   # we want to let the next matching route handler process this one
                   send_file(...);
                   # This code will be ignored
                   do_stuff();
               }
           };

       Send  file  supports  streaming possibility using PSGI streaming. The server should support it but normal
       streaming is supported on most, if not all.

           get '/download/:file' =&gt; sub {
               send_file( params-&gt;{file}, streaming =&gt; 1 );
           }

       You can control what happens using callbacks.

       First, "around_content" allows you to get the writer object and the  chunk  of  content  read,  and  then
       decide what to do with each chunk:

           get '/download/:file' =&gt; sub {
               send_file(
                   params-&gt;{file},
                   streaming =&gt; 1,
                   callbacks =&gt; {
                       around_content =&gt; sub {
                           my ( $writer, $chunk ) = @_;
                           $writer-&gt;write("* $chunk");
                       },
                   },
               );
           }

       You  can  use  "around" to all get all the content (whether a filehandle if it's a regular file or a full
       string if it's a scalar ref) and decide what to do with it:

           get '/download/:file' =&gt; sub {
               send_file(
                   params-&gt;{file},
                   streaming =&gt; 1,
                   callbacks =&gt; {
                       around =&gt; sub {
                           my ( $writer, $content ) = @_;

                           # we know it's a text file, so we'll just stream
                           # line by line
                           while ( my $line = &lt;$content&gt; ) {
                               $writer-&gt;write($line);
                           }
                       },
                   },
               );
           }

       Or you could use "override" to control the entire streaming callback request:

           get '/download/:file' =&gt; sub {
               send_file(
                   params-&gt;{file},
                   streaming =&gt; 1,
                   callbacks =&gt; {
                       override =&gt; sub {
                           my ( $respond, $response ) = @_;

                           my $writer = $respond-&gt;( [ $newstatus, $newheaders ] );
                           $writer-&gt;write("some line");
                       },
                   },
               );
           }

       You can also set the number of bytes that will be read at a time (default being 42K bytes) using "bytes":

           get '/download/:file' =&gt; sub {
               send_file(
                   params-&gt;{file},
                   streaming =&gt; 1,
                   bytes     =&gt; 524288, # 512K
               );
           };

       The content-type will be set depending on the current MIME types definition (see "mime" if  you  want  to
       define your own).

       If  your  filename does not have an extension, or you need to force a specific mime type, you can pass it
       to "send_file" as follows:

           send_file(params-&gt;{file}, content_type =&gt; 'image/png');

       Also, you can use your aliases or file extension names on "content_type", like this:

           send_file(params-&gt;{file}, content_type =&gt; 'png');

       For files outside your <b>public</b> folder, you can use the "system_path" switch. Just bear in  mind  that  its
       use needs caution as it can be dangerous.

          send_file('<a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>', system_path =&gt; 1);

       If  you  have your data in a scalar variable, "send_file" can be useful as well. Pass a reference to that
       scalar, and "send_file" will behave as if there were a file with that contents:

          send_file( \$data, content_type =&gt; 'image/png' );

       Note that Dancer is unable to guess the content type from the data contents. Therefore you might need  to
       set  the "content_type" properly. For this kind of usage an attribute named "filename" can be useful.  It
       is used as the Content-Disposition header, to hint the browser about the filename it should use.

          send_file( \$data, content_type =&gt; 'image/png'
                                    filename     =&gt; 'onion.png' );

   <b>set</b>
       Defines a setting:

           set something =&gt; 'value';

       You can set more than one value at once:

           set something =&gt; 'value', otherthing =&gt; 'othervalue';

   <b>setting</b>
       Returns the value of a given setting:

           setting('something'); # 'value'

   <b>set_cookie</b>
       Creates or updates cookie values:

           get '/some_action' =&gt; sub {
               set_cookie name =&gt; 'value',
                          expires =&gt; (time + 3600),
                          domain  =&gt; '.foo.com';
           };

       In the example above, only 'name' and 'value' are mandatory.

       You can also store more complex structure in your cookies:

           get '/some_auth' =&gt; sub {
               set_cookie oauth =&gt; {
                   token        =&gt; $twitter-&gt;request_token,
                   token_secret =&gt; $twitter-&gt;secret_token,
                   ...
               };
           };

       You can't store more complex structure than this. All keys in the  HashRef  should  be  Scalars;  storing
       references will not work.

       See Dancer::Cookie for further options when creating your cookie.

       Note that this method will be eventually deprecated in favor of the new "cookie" method.

   <b>session</b>
       Provides access to all data stored in the user's session (if any).

       It can also be used as a setter to store data in the session:

           # getter example
           get '/user' =&gt; sub {
               if (session('user')) {
                   return "Hello, ".session('user')-&gt;name;
               }
           };

           # setter example
           post '/user/login' =&gt; sub {
               ...
               if ($logged_in) {
                   session user =&gt; $user;
               }
               ...
           };

       You may also need to clear a session:

           # destroy session
           get '/logout' =&gt; sub {
               ...
               session-&gt;destroy;
               ...
           };

       If you need to fetch the session ID being used for any reason:

           my $id = session-&gt;id;

       In  order  to  be  able  to  use  sessions,  first   you  need  to  enable  session support in one of the
       configuration files.  A quick way to do it is to add

           session: "YAML"

       to config.yml.

       For more details, see Dancer::Session.

   <b>splat</b>
       Returns the list of captures made from a route handler with a route pattern which includes wildcards:

           get '/file/*.*' =&gt; sub {
               my ($file, $extension) = splat;
               ...
           };

       There is also the extensive  splat  (A.K.A.  "megasplat"),  which  allows  extensive  greedier  matching,
       available using two asterisks. The additional path is broken down and returned as an ArrayRef:

           get '/entry/*/tags/**' =&gt; sub {
               my ( $entry_id, $tags ) = splat;
               my @tags = @{$tags};
           };

       This helps with chained actions:

           get '/team/*/**' =&gt; sub {
               my ($team) = splat;
               var team =&gt; $team;
               pass;
           };

           prefix '/team/*';

           get '/player/*' =&gt; sub {
               my ($player) = splat;

               # etc...
           };

           get '/score' =&gt; sub {
               return score_for( vars-&gt;{'team'} );
           };

   <b>start</b>
       Starts the application or the standalone server (depending on the deployment choices).

       This keyword should be called at the very end of the script, once all routes are defined.  At this point,
       Dancer takes over control.

   <b>status</b>
       Changes  the  status  code  provided  by  an action.  By default, an action will produce an "HTTP 200 OK"
       status code, meaning everything is OK:

           get '/download/:file' =&gt; {
               if (! -f params-&gt;{file}) {
                   status 'not_found';
                   return "File does not exist, unable to download";
               }
               # serving the file...
           };

       In that example Dancer will notice that the status has changed, and will render the response accordingly.

       The status keyword receives either a numeric status code or its name in lower case, with underscores as a
       separator for blanks. See the list in "HTTP CODES" in Dancer::HTTP.

   <b>template</b>
       Returns the response of processing the given template with the given parameters (and optional  settings),
       wrapping it in the default or specified layout too, if layouts are in use.

       An  example  of  a  route handler which returns the result of using template to build a response with the
       current template engine:

           get '/' =&gt; sub {
               ...
               return template 'some_view', { token =&gt; 'value'};
           };

       Note that "template" simply returns the content, so when you use it in a route handler, if  execution  of
       the  route  handler  should  stop  at that point, make sure you use 'return' to ensure your route handler
       returns the content.

       Since template just returns the result of rendering the template, you can also use it  to  perform  other
       templating tasks, e.g. generating emails:

           post '/some/route' =&gt; sub {
               if (...) {
                   email {
                       to      =&gt; '<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">someone@example.com</a>',
                       from    =&gt; '<a href="mailto:foo@example.com">foo@example.com</a>',
                       subject =&gt; 'Hello there',
                       msg     =&gt; template('emails/foo', { name =&gt; params-&gt;{name} }),
                   };

                   return template 'message_sent';
               } else {
                   return template 'error';
               }
           };

       Compatibility  notice:  "template"  was changed in version 1.3090 to immediately interrupt execution of a
       route handler and return the content, as it's typically used at the end of  a  route  handler  to  return
       content.   However,  this caused issues for some people who were using "template" to generate emails etc,
       rather than accessing the template engine directly, so this change has been reverted in 1.3091.

       The first parameter should be a template available in the views directory, the second one (optional) is a
       HashRef of tokens to interpolate, and the third (again optional) is a HashRef of options.

       For example, to disable the layout for a specific request:

           get '/' =&gt; sub {
               template 'index', {}, { layout =&gt; undef };
           };

       Or to request a specific layout, of course:

           get '/user' =&gt; sub {
               template 'user', {}, { layout =&gt; 'user' };
           };

       Some tokens are automatically added  to  your  template  ("perl_version",  "dancer_version",  "settings",
       "request",    "params",    "vars"    and,    if   you   have   sessions   enabled,   "session").    Check
       Dancer::Template::Abstract for further details.

   <b>to_dumper</b> <b>($structure)</b>
       Serializes a structure with Data::Dumper.

   <b>to_json</b> <b>($structure,</b> <b>\%options)</b>
       Serializes a structure to JSON. Can receive optional arguments. Thoses arguments are valid JSON arguments
       to change the behaviour of the default "JSON::to_json" function.

       Compatibility notice: "to_json" changed in 1.3002 to take a hashref as options, instead of a hash.

   <b>to_yaml</b> <b>($structure)</b>
       Serializes a structure to YAML.

   <b>to_xml</b> <b>($structure,</b> <b>%options)</b>
       Serializes a structure to XML. Can receive optional arguments. Thoses  arguments  are  valid  XML::Simple
       arguments to change the behaviour of the default "XML::Simple::XMLout" function.

   <b>true</b>
       Constant that returns a true value (1).

   <b>upload</b>
       Provides  access  to  file uploads.  Any uploaded file is accessible as a Dancer::Request::Upload object.
       You can access all parsed uploads via:

           post '/some/route' =&gt; sub {
               my $file = upload('file_input_foo');
               # file is a Dancer::Request::Upload object
           };

       If you named multiple inputs of type "file" with the same name, the upload keyword will return  an  Array
       of Dancer::Request::Upload objects:

           post '/some/route' =&gt; sub {
               my ($file1, $file2) = upload('files_input');
               # $file1 and $file2 are Dancer::Request::Upload objects
           };

       You can also access the raw HashRef of parsed uploads via the current request object:

           post '/some/route' =&gt; sub {
               my $all_uploads = request-&gt;uploads;
               # $all_uploads-&gt;{'file_input_foo'} is a Dancer::Request::Upload object
               # $all_uploads-&gt;{'files_input'} is an ArrayRef of Dancer::Request::Upload objects
           };

       Note that you can also access the filename of the upload received via the params keyword:

           post '/some/route' =&gt; sub {
               # params-&gt;{'files_input'} is the filename of the file uploaded
           };

       See Dancer::Request::Upload for details about the interface provided.

   <b>uri_for</b>
       Returns a fully-qualified URI for the given path:

           get '/' =&gt; sub {
               redirect uri_for('/path');
               # can be something like: <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:3000/path
           };

       Querystring  parameters  can  be provided by passing a hashref as a second param, and URL-encoding can be
       disabled via a third parameter:

           uri_for('/path', { foo =&gt; 'bar' }, 1);
           # would return e.g. <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:3000/path?foo=bar

   <b>captures</b>
       Returns a reference to a copy of "%+", if there are named captures in the route Regexp.

       Named captures are a feature of Perl 5.10, and are not supported in earlier versions:

           get qr{
               / (?&lt;object&gt; user   | ticket | comment )
               / (?&lt;action&gt; delete | find )
               / (?&lt;id&gt; \d+ )
               /?$
           }x
           , sub {
               my $value_for = captures;
               "i don't want to $$value_for{action} the $$value_for{object} $$value_for{id} !"
           };

   <b>var</b>
       Provides an accessor for variables shared between filters and route handlers.  Given a key/value pair, it
       sets a variable:

           hook before sub {
               var foo =&gt; 42;
           };

       Later, route handlers and other filters will be able to read that variable:

           get '/path' =&gt; sub {
               my $foo = var 'foo';
               ...
           };

   <b>vars</b>
       Returns the HashRef of all shared variables set during the filter/route chain with the "var" keyword:

           get '/path' =&gt; sub {
               if (vars-&gt;{foo} eq 42) {
                   ...
               }
           };

   <b>warning</b>
       Logs a warning message through the current logger engine:

           warning "This is a warning";

       See Dancer::Logger for details on how to configure where log messages go.
