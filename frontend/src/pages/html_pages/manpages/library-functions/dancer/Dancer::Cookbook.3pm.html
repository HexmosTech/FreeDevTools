</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer::Cookbook - a quick-start guide to the Dancer web framework

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.3521

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A quick-start guide with examples to get you up and running with the Dancer web framework.

</pre><h4><b>BEGINNER'S</b> <b>DANCE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Your</b> <b>first</b> <b>Dancer</b> <b>web</b> <b>app</b>
       Dancer has been designed to be easy to work with. It's trivial to write a simple web app, but still has
       the power to work with larger projects.  To start with, let's make an incredibly simple "Hello World"
       example:

           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>

           use Dancer;

           get '/hello/:name' =&gt; sub {
               return "Why, hello there " . params-&gt;{name};
           };

           dance;

       Yes, the above is a fully-functioning web app; running that script will launch a webserver listening on
       the default port (3000). Now you can make a request

           $ curl <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:3000/hello/Bob
           Why, hello there Bob

       (or the name of the machine you ran it on, if it's not your local system), and it will say hello.  The
       ":name" part is a named parameter within the route specification whose value is made available through
       "params" - more on that later.

       Note that you don't need to use the "strict" and "warnings" pragma, they are already loaded by Dancer.
       (If you don't want the "warnings" pragma (which can lead to undesired warnings about use of undef values,
       for example), then set the import_warnings setting to a false value.

   <b>Starting</b> <b>a</b> <b>Dancer</b> <b>project</b>
       The first simple example is fine for trivial projects, but for anything more complex you'll want a more
       maintainable solution - enter the "dancer" helper script, which will build the framework of your
       application with a single command:

           $ dancer -a mywebapp
           + mywebapp
           + mywebapp/bin
           + mywebapp/bin/app.pl
           + mywebapp/config.yml
           + mywebapp/environments
           + mywebapp/environments/development.yml
           + mywebapp/environments/production.yml
           + mywebapp/views
           + mywebapp/views/index.tt
           + mywebapp/views/layouts
           + mywebapp/views/layouts/main.tt
           + mywebapp/MANIFEST.SKIP
           + mywebapp/lib
           + mywebapp/lib/mywebapp.pm
           + mywebapp/public
           + mywebapp/public/css
           + mywebapp/public/css/style.css
           + mywebapp/public/css/error.css
           + mywebapp/public/images
           + mywebapp/public/500.html
           + mywebapp/public/404.html
           + mywebapp/public/dispatch.fcgi
           + mywebapp/public/dispatch.cgi
           + mywebapp/public/javascripts
           + mywebapp/public/javascripts/jquery.min.js
           + mywebapp/t
           + mywebapp/t/002_index_route.t
           + mywebapp/t/001_base.t
           + mywebapp/Makefile.PL

       As you can see, it creates a directory named after the name of the app, along with a configuration file,
       a views directory (where your templates and layouts will live), an environments directory (where
       environment-specific settings live), a module containing the actual guts of your application, a script to
       start it - or to run your web app via Plack/PSGI - more on that later.

</pre><h4><b>DANCE</b> <b>ROUTINES:</b> <b>ROUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Declaring</b> <b>routes</b>
       To control what happens when a web request is received by your webapp, you'll need to declare "routes".
       A route declaration indicates for which HTTP method(s) it is valid, the path it matches (e.g. /foo/bar),
       and a coderef to execute, which returns the response.

           get '/hello/:name' =&gt; sub {
               return "Hi there " . params-&gt;{name};
           };

       The above route specifies that, for GET requests to '/hello/...', the code block provided should be
       executed.

   <b>Handling</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>HTTP</b> <b>request</b> <b>methods</b>
       Routes can use "any" to match all, or a specified list of HTTP methods.

       The following will match any HTTP request to the path /myaction:

           any '/myaction' =&gt; sub {
               # code
           }

       The following will match GET or POST requests to /myaction:

           any ['get', 'post'] =&gt; '/myaction' =&gt; sub {
               # code
           };

       For convenience, any route which matches GET requests will also match HEAD requests.

   <b>Retrieving</b> <b>request</b> <b>parameters</b>
       The params keyword returns a hashref of request parameters; these will be parameters supplied on the
       query string, within the path itself (with named placeholders), and, for HTTP POST requests, the content
       of the POST body.

   <b>Named</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>in</b> <b>route</b> <b>path</b> <b>declarations</b>
       As seen above, you can use ":somename" in a route's path to capture part of the path; this will become
       available by calling params.

       So, for a web app where you want to display information on a company, you might use something like:

           get '/company/view/:companyid' =&gt; sub {
               my $company_id = params-&gt;{companyid};
               # Look up the company and return appropriate page
           };

   <b>Wildcard</b> <b>path</b> <b>matching</b> <b>and</b> <b>splat</b>
       You can also declare wildcards in a path, and retrieve the values they matched with the splat keyword:

           get '/*/*' =&gt; sub {
               my ($action, $id) = splat;
               if (my $action eq 'view') {
                   return display_item($id);
               } elsif ($action eq 'delete') {
                   return delete_item($id);
               } else {
                   status 'not_found';
                   return "What?";
               }
           };

   <b>Before</b> <b>hooks</b> <b>-</b> <b>processed</b> <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>request</b>
       A before hook declares code which should be handled before a request is passed to the appropriate route.

           hook 'before' =&gt; sub {
               var note =&gt; 'Hi there';
               request-&gt;path_info('/foo/oversee')
           };

           get '/foo/*' =&gt; sub {
               my ($match) = splat; # 'oversee';
               vars-&gt;{note}; # 'Hi there'
           };

       The above declares a before hook which uses "var" to set a variable which will later be available within
       the route handler, then amends the path of the request to "/foo/oversee"; this means that, whatever path
       was requested, it will be treated as though the path requested was "/foo/oversee".

   <b>Default</b> <b>route</b>
       In case you want to avoid a <u>404</u> <u>error</u>, or handle multiple routes in the same way and you don't feel like
       configuring all of them, you can set up a default route handler.

       The default route handler will handle any request that doesn't get served by any other route.

       All you need to do is set up the following route as the <b>last</b> route:

           any qr{.*} =&gt; sub {
               status 'not_found';
               template 'special_404', { path =&gt; request-&gt;path };
           };

       Then you can set up the template as such:

           You tried to reach &lt;% path %&gt;, but it is unavailable at the moment.

           Please try again or contact us at our email at &lt;...&gt;.

   <b>Using</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto_page</b> <b>feature</b> <b>for</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>route</b> <b>creation</b>
       For simple "static" pages, you can simply enable the "auto_page" config setting; this means that you need
       not declare a route handler for those pages; if a request is for "/foo/bar", Dancer will check for a
       matching view (e.g.  "/foo/bar.tt" and render it with the default layout etc if found.  For full details,
       see the documentation for the auto_page setting.

   <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ajax</b> <b>plugin</b>
       As an Ajax query is just an HTTP query, it's similar to a GET or POST route. You may ask yourself why you
       may want to use the "ajax" keyword (from the Dancer::Plugin::Ajax plugin) instead of a simple "get".

       Let's say you have a path like '/user/:user' in your application. You may want to be able to serve this
       page, with a layout and HTML content. But you may also want to be able to call this same url from a
       javascript query using Ajax.

       So, instead of having the following code:

           get '/user/:user' =&gt; sub {
                if (request-&gt;is_ajax) {
                    # create xml, set headers to text/xml, blablabla
                     header('Content-Type' =&gt; 'text/xml');
                     header('Cache-Control' =&gt;  'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate');
                     to_xml({...})
                }else{
                    template users, {....}
                }
           };

       you can have

           get '/user/:user' =&gt; sub {
               template users, {...}
           }

       and

           ajax '/user/:user' =&gt; sub {
                to_xml({...}, RootName =&gt; undef);
           }

       Because it's an Ajax query you know you need to return XML content, so the content type of the response
       is set for you.

   <b>Using</b> <b>the</b> <b>prefix</b> <b>feature</b> <b>to</b> <b>split</b> <b>your</b> <b>application</b>
       For better maintainability you may want to separate some of your application components to different
       packages. Let's say we have a simple web app with an admin section, and want to maintain this in a
       different package:

           package myapp;
           use Dancer ':syntax';
           use myapp::admin;

           prefix undef;

           get '/' =&gt; sub {...};

           1;

           package myapp::admin;
           use Dancer ':syntax';

           prefix '/admin';

           get '/' =&gt; sub {...};

           1;

       The following routes will be generated for us:

           - get /
           - get /admin/
           - head /
           - head /admin/

</pre><h4><b>MUSCLE</b> <b>MEMORY:</b> <b>STORING</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Handling</b> <b>sessions</b>
       It's common to want to use sessions to give your web applications state; for instance, allowing a user to
       log in, creating a session, and checking that session on subsequent requests.

       To make use of sessions you must first enable the session engine. Pick the session engine you want to
       use, then declare it in your config file:

           session: Simple

       The Dancer::Session::Simple backend implements very simple in-memory session storage.  This will be fast
       and useful for testing, but sessions do not persist between restarts of your app.

       You can also use the Dancer::Session::YAML backend included with Dancer, which stores session data on
       disc in YAML files (since YAML is a nice human-readable format, it makes inspecting the contents of
       sessions a breeze):

           session: YAML

       Or, to enable session support from within your code,

           set session =&gt; 'YAML';

       (Controlling settings is best done from your config file, though).  'YAML' in the example is the session
       backend to use; this is shorthand for Dancer::Session::YAML.  There are other session backends you may
       wish to use, for instance Dancer::Session::Memcache, but the YAML backend is a simple and easy to use
       example which stores session data in a YAML file in sessions).

       You can then use the session keyword to manipulate the session:

       <u>Storing</u> <u>data</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>session</u>

       Storing data in the session is as easy as:

           session varname =&gt; 'value';

       <u>Retrieving</u> <u>data</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>session</u>

       Retrieving data from the session is as easy as:

           session('varname')

       Or, alternatively,

           session-&gt;{varname}

       <u>Controlling</u> <u>where</u> <u>sessions</u> <u>are</u> <u>stored</u>

       For disc-based session back ends like Dancer::Session::YAML, Dancer::Session::Storable etc, session files
       are written to the session dir specified by the "session_dir" setting, which defaults to
       "appdir/sessions".

       If you need to control where session files are created, you can do so quickly and easily within your
       config file. For example:

           session_dir: /tmp/dancer-sessions

       If the directory you specify does not exist, Dancer will attempt to create it for you.

       <u>Destroying</u> <u>a</u> <u>session</u>

       When you're done with your session, you can destroy it:

           session-&gt;destroy

   <b>Sessions</b> <b>and</b> <b>logging</b> <b>in</b>
       A common requirement is to check the user is logged in, and, if not, require them to log in before
       continuing.

       This can easily be handled with a before hook to check their session:

           hook 'before' =&gt; sub {
               if (! session('user') &amp;&amp; request-&gt;path_info !~ m{^/login}) {
                   var requested_path =&gt; request-&gt;path_info;
                   request-&gt;path_info('/login');
               }
           };

           get '/login' =&gt; sub {
               # Display a login page; the original URL they requested is available as
               # vars-&gt;{requested_path}, so could be put in a hidden field in the form
               template 'login', { path =&gt; vars-&gt;{requested_path} };
           };

           post '/login' =&gt; sub {
               # Validate the username and password they supplied
               if (params-&gt;{user} eq 'bob' &amp;&amp; params-&gt;{pass} eq 'letmein') {
                   session user =&gt; params-&gt;{user};
                   redirect params-&gt;{path} || '/';
               } else {
                   redirect '/login?failed=1';
               }
           };

       In your login page template, you'll want a text field named user, a password field named pass, and a
       hidden field named path, which will be populated with the path originally requested, so that it's sent
       back in the POST submission, and can be used by the post route to redirect onwards to the page originally
       requested once you're logged in.

       Of course you'll probably want to validate your users against a database table, or maybe via
       IMAP/LDAP/SSH/POP3/local system accounts via PAM etc.  Authen::Simple is probably a good starting point
       here!

       A simple working example of handling authentication against a database table yourself (using
       Dancer::Plugin::Database which provides the "database" keyword, and Crypt::SaltedHash to handle salted
       hashed passwords (well, you wouldn't store your users' passwords in the clear, would you?)) follows:

           post '/login' =&gt; sub {
               my $user = database-&gt;quick_select('users',
                   { username =&gt; params-&gt;{user} }
               );
               if (!$user) {
                   warning "Failed login for unrecognised user " . params-&gt;{user};
                   redirect '/login?failed=1';
               } else {
                   if (Crypt::SaltedHash-&gt;validate($user-&gt;{password}, params-&gt;{pass}))
                   {
                       debug "Password correct";
                       # Logged in successfully
                       session user =&gt; $user;
                       redirect params-&gt;{path} || '/';
                   } else {
                       debug("Login failed - password incorrect for " . params-&gt;{user});
                       redirect '/login?failed=1';
                   }
               }
           };

       <u>Retrieve</u> <u>complete</u> <u>hash</u> <u>stored</u> <u>in</u> <u>session</u>

       Get complete hash stored in session:

           my $hash = session;

</pre><h4><b>APPEARANCE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Using</b> <b>templates</b> <b>-</b> <b>views</b> <b>and</b> <b>layouts</b>
       Returning plain content is all well and good for examples or trivial apps, but soon you'll want to use
       templates to maintain separation between your code and your content.  Dancer makes this easy.

       Your route handlers can use the template keyword to render templates.

       <u>Views</u>

       It's possible to render the action's content with a template, this is called a view. The `appdir/views'
       directory is the place where views are located.

       You can change this location by changing the setting 'views'.

       By default, the internal template engine Dancer::Template::Simple is used, but you may want to upgrade to
       Template::Toolkit. If you do so, you have to enable this engine in your settings as explained in
       Dancer::Template::TemplateToolkit.  If you do so, you'll also have to import the Template module in your
       application code.

       Note that, by default, Dancer configures the Template::Toolkit engine to use "&lt;% %"&gt; brackets instead of
       its default "[% %]" brackets.  You can change this by using the following in your config file:

           template: template_toolkit

           engines:
               template_toolkit:
                   start_tag: '[%'
                   stop_tag: '%]'

       All views must have a '.tt' extension. This may change in the future.

       To render a view just call the "template|Dancer/template" keyword at the end of the action by giving the
       view name and the HASHREF of tokens to interpolate in the view (note that for convenience, the request,
       session, params and vars are automatically accessible in the view, named "request", "session", "params"
       and "vars"). For example:

           hook 'before' =&gt; sub { var time =&gt; scalar(localtime) };

           get '/hello/:name' =&gt; sub {
               my $name = params-&gt;{name};
               template 'hello.tt', { name =&gt; $name };
           };

       The template 'hello.tt' could contain, for example:

           &lt;p&gt;Hi there, &lt;% name %&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;p&gt;You're using &lt;% request.user_agent %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;% IF session.username %&gt;
               &lt;p&gt;You're logged in as &lt;% session.username %&gt;
           &lt;% END %&gt;
           It's currently &lt;% vars.time %&gt;

       For a full list of the tokens automatically added to your template (like "session", "request" and "vars",
       refer to Dancer::Template::Abstract).

       <u>Layouts</u>

       A layout is a special view, located in the 'layouts' directory (inside the views directory) which must
       have a token named 'content'. That token marks the place to render the action view. This lets you define
       a global layout for your actions, and have each individual view contain only the specific content.  This
       is a good thing to avoid lots of needless duplication of HTML :)

       Here is an example of a layout: "views/layouts/main.tt" :

           &lt;html&gt;
               &lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;
               &lt;body&gt;
               &lt;div id="header"&gt;
               ...
               &lt;/div&gt;

               &lt;div id="content"&gt;
               &lt;% content %&gt;
               &lt;/div&gt;

               &lt;/body&gt;
           &lt;/html&gt;

       You can tell your app which layout to use with "layout: name" in the config file, or within your code:

           set layout =&gt; 'main';

       You can control which layout to use (or whether to use a layout at all) for a specific request without
       altering the layout setting by passing an options hashref as the third param to the template keyword:

           template 'index.tt', {}, { layout =&gt; undef };

       If your application is not mounted under root (<b>/</b>), you can use a before_template_render hook instead of
       hardcoding the path to your application for your css, images and javascript:

           hook 'before_template_render' =&gt; sub {
               my $tokens = shift;
               $tokens-&gt;{uri_base} = request-&gt;base-&gt;path;
           };

       Then in your layout, modify your css inclusion as follows:

           &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="&lt;% uri_base %&gt;/css/style.css" /&gt;

       From now on, you can mount your application wherever you want, without any further modification of the
       css inclusion

       <u>template</u> <u>and</u> <u>unicode</u>

       If you use Plack and have some unicode problem with your Dancer application, don't forget to check if you
       have set your template engine to use unicode, and set the default charset to UTF-8. So, if you are using
       template toolkit, your config.yml will look like this:

           charset: UTF-8
           engines:
             template_toolkit:
               ENCODING: utf8

       <u>TT's</u> <u>WRAPPER</u> <u>directive</u> <u>in</u> <u>Dancer</u> <u>(META</u> <u>variables,</u> <u>SETs)</u>

       Dancer already provides a WRAPPER-like ability, which we call a "layout". The reason we do not use TT's
       WRAPPER (which also makes it incompatible with Dancer) is because not all template systems support it.
       Actually, most don't.

       However, you might want to use it, and be able to define META variables and regular Template::Toolkit
       variables.

       These few steps will get you there:

       •   Disable the layout in Dancer

           You can do this by simply commenting (or removing) the "layout" configuration in the <u>config.yml</u> file.

       •   Use Template Toolkit template engine

           Change the configuration of the template to Template Toolkit:

               # in config.yml
               template: "template_toolkit"

       •   Tell the Template Toolkit engine who's your wrapper

               # in config.yml
               # ...
               engines:
                   template_toolkit:
                       WRAPPER: layouts/main.tt

       Done! Everything will work fine out of the box, including variables and META variables.

</pre><h4><b>SETTING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>STAGE:</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LOGGING</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Configuration</b> <b>and</b> <b>environments</b>
       Configuring a Dancer application can be done in many ways. The easiest one (and maybe the dirtiest) is to
       put all your settings statements at the top of your script, before calling the <b>dance()</b> method.

       Other  ways are possible. You can define all your settings in the file `appdir/config.yml'. For this, you
       must have installed the YAML module, and of course, write the config file in YAML.

       That's better than the first option, but it's still not perfect as  you  can't  switch  easily  from  one
       environment to another without rewriting the config.yml file.

       The better way is to have one config.yml file with default global settings, like the following:

           # appdir/config.yml
           logger: 'file'
           layout: 'main'

       And  then write as many environment files as you like in "appdir/environments".  That way the appropriate
       environment config file will be loaded according to the running environment (if  none  is  specified,  it
       will be 'development').

       Note that you can change the running environment using the "--environment" command line switch.

       Typically, you'll want to set the following values in a development config file:

           # appdir/environments/development.yml
           log: 'debug'
           startup_info: 1
           show_errors:  1

       And in a production one:

           # appdir/environments/production.yml
           log: 'warning'
           startup_info: 0
           show_errors:  0

   <b>Accessing</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>information</b> <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>app</b>
       A  Dancer  application can use the 'config' keyword to easily access the settings within its config file,
       for instance:

           get '/appname' =&gt; sub {
               return "This is " . config-&gt;{appname};
           };

       This makes keeping your application's settings all in one place simple and easy.  You shouldn't  need  to
       worry about implementing all that yourself :)

   <b>Accessing</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>information</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> <b>script</b>
       You  may  well want to access your webapp's configuration from outside your webapp. You could, of course,
       use the YAML module of your choice and load your webapps's config.yml, but chances are that this  is  not
       convenient.

       Use  Dancer  instead. Without any ado, magic or too big jumps, you can use the values from config.yml and
       some additional default values:

               # bin/script1.pl
               use Dancer ':script';
               print "template:".config-&gt;{template}."\n"; #simple
               print "log:".config-&gt;{log}."\n"; #undef

       Note that config-&gt;{log} should result in an undef error on a default scaffold since you did not load  the
       environment  and  in  the default scaffold log is defined in the environment and not in config.yml. Hence
       undef.

       If you want to load an environment you need to tell Dancer where to look for it.  One way to do so, is to
       tell Dancer where the webapp lives. From there Dancer deduces where the  config.yml  file  is  (typically
       $webapp/config.yml).

               # bin/script2.pl
               use FindBin;
               use Cwd qw/realpath/;
               use Dancer ':script';

               #tell the Dancer where the app lives
               my $appdir=realpath( "$FindBin::Bin/..");

               Dancer::Config::setting('appdir',$appdir);
               Dancer::Config::load();

               #getter
               print "environment:".config-&gt;{environment}."\n"; #development
               print "log:".config-&gt;{log}."\n"; #value from development environment

       By  default  Dancer  loads  development  environment  (typically $webapp/environment/development.yml). In
       contrast  to  the  example  before,  you   do   have   a   value   from   the   development   environment
       (environment/development.yml) now. Also note that in the above example Cwd and FindBin are used. They are
       likely  to  be  already loaded by Dancer anyways, so it's not a big overhead. You could just as well hand
       over a simple path for the app if you like that better, e.g.:

               Dancer::Config::setting('appdir','/path/to/app/dir');

       If you want to load an environment other than the default, try this:

               # bin/script2.pl
               use Dancer ':script';

               #tell the Dancer where the app lives
               Dancer::Config::setting('appdir','/path/to/app/dir');

               #which environment to load
               config-&gt;{environment}='production';

               Dancer::Config::load();

               #getter
               print "log:".config-&gt;{log}."\n"; #has value from production environment

       By the way, you not only get values, you can also set  values  straightforward  like  we  do  above  with
       config-&gt;{environment}='production'. Of course, this value does not get written in any file; it only lives
       in memory and your webapp doesn't have access to it, but you can use it inside your script.

       If  you  don't  want to make your script environment-specific, or add extra arguments to it, you can also
       set    the    environment    using    a     shell     variable,     DANCER_ENVIRONMENT.      See     also
       "DANCER_CONFDIR-and-DANCER_ENVDIR" in Dancer::Config

   <b>Logging</b>
       <u>Configuring</u> <u>logging</u>

       It's possible to log messages generated by the application and by Dancer itself.

       To  start  logging,  select the logging engine you wish to use with the "logger" setting; Dancer includes
       built-in log engines named "file" and "console", which log to a logfile and to the console respectively.

       To enable logging to a file, add the following to your config.yml:

           logger: 'file'

       Then you can choose which kind of messages you want to actually log:

           log: 'core'      # will log all messages, including messages from
                            # Dancer itself
           log: 'debug'     # will log debug, info, warning and error messages
           log: 'info'      # will log info, warning and error messages
           log: 'warning'   # will log warning and error messages
           log: 'error'     # will log error messages

       If you're using the "file" logging engine, a directory "appdir/logs" will be created and  will  host  one
       logfile  per  environment.  The  log  message  contains  the  time it was written, the PID of the current
       process, the message and the caller information (file and line).

       <u>Logging</u> <u>your</u> <u>own</u> <u>messages</u>

       Just call  debug, warning, error or info with your message:

           debug "This is a debug message from my app.";

</pre><h4><b>RESTING</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>REST</b> <b>application</b>
       With Dancer, it's easy to write REST applications. Dancer provides helpers to serialize  and  deserialize
       for the following data formats:

       JSON
       YAML
       XML
       Data::Dumper

       To  activate  this  feature, you only have to set the "serializer" setting to the format you require, for
       instance in your config.yml:

          serializer: JSON

       Or right in your code:

          set serializer =&gt; 'JSON';

       From now, all HashRefs or ArrayRefs returned by a route will be serialized to the format you  chose,  and
       all data received from <b>POST</b> or <b>PUT</b> requests will be automatically deserialized.

           get '/hello/:name' =&gt; sub {
               # this structure will be returned to the client as
               # {"name":"$name"}
               return {name =&gt; params-&gt;{name}};
           };

       It's  possible  to  let  the  client  choose  which serializer he wants to use. For this, use the <b>mutable</b>
       serializer, and an appropriate serializer will be chosen from the <b>Content-Type</b> header.

       It's also possible to return a custom error, using  the  send_error  keyword..   When  you  don't  use  a
       serializer,  the  "send_error"  function  will take a string as the first parameter (the message), and an
       optional HTTP code. When using a serializer, the message can be a string, an ArrayRef or a HashRef:

           get '/hello/:name' =&gt; sub {
               if (...) {
                  send_error("you can't do that");
                  # or
                  send_error({reason =&gt; 'access denied', message =&gt; "no"});
               }
           };

       The content of the error will be serialized using the appropriate serializer.

   <b>Deploying</b> <b>your</b> <b>Dancer</b> <b>applications</b>
       For examples on deploying your Dancer  applications  including  standalone,  behind  proxy/load-balancing
       software,   and   using   common   web   servers  including  Apache  to  run  via  CGI/FastCGI  etc,  see
       Dancer::Deployment.

</pre><h4><b>DANCER</b> <b>ON</b> <b>THE</b> <b>STAGE:</b> <b>DEPLOYMENT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Plack</b> <b>middlewares</b>
       If you deploy with Plack and use some Plack middlewares, you  can  enable  them  directly  from  Dancer's
       configuration files.

       <u>Generic</u> <u>middlewares</u>

       To enable middlewares in Dancer, you just have to set the plack_middlewares setting like the following:

           set plack_middlewares =&gt; [
               [ 'SomeMiddleware' =&gt; qw(some options for somemiddleware) ],
           ];

       For  instance, if you want to enable Plack::Middleware::Debug in your Dancer application, all you have to
       do is to set "plack_middlewares" like that:

           set plack_middlewares =&gt; [
               [ 'Debug' =&gt; ( 'panels' =&gt; [qw(DBITrace Memory Timer)] ) ],
           ];

       Of course, you can also put this configuration into your config.yml file, or  even  in  your  environment
       configuration files:

           # environments/development.yml
           ...
           plack_middlewares:
             -
               - Debug          # first element of the array is the name of the middleware
               - panels         # following elements are the configuration of the middleware
               -
                   - DBITrace
                   - Memory
                   - Timer

       <u>Path-based</u> <u>middlewares</u>

       If  you  want  to set up a middleware for a specific path, you can do that using "plack_middlewares_map".
       You'll need Plack::App::URLMap to do that.

           plack_middlewares_map:
               '/':      ['Debug']
               '/timer': ['Timer'],

</pre><h4><b>DEVELOPMENT</b> <b>TOOLS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Auto-reloading</b> <b>code</b>
       When you are furiously hacking on your Dancer app, it might come in handy to have the  application  auto-
       detect changes in the code and reload itself.

       To  do  that,  you  can  use Plack::Loader::Shotgun, Plack::Middleware::Refresh, or plackup with the "-r"
       switch:

          plackup -r bin/appl.pl  (will restart the app whenever a file in .<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a> or .<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a> is modified
