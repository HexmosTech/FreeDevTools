</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer::Plugin - helper for writing Dancer plugins

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.3521

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package Dancer::Plugin::LinkBlocker;
         use Dancer ':syntax';
         use Dancer::Plugin;

         register block_links_from =&gt; sub {
           my $conf = plugin_setting();
           my $re = join ('|', @{$conf-&gt;{hosts}});
           before sub {
               if (request-&gt;referer &amp;&amp; request-&gt;referer =~ /$re/) {
                   status 403 || $conf-&gt;{http_code};
               }
           };
         };

         register_plugin;
         1;

       And in your application:

           package My::Webapp;

           use Dancer ':syntax';
           use Dancer::Plugin::LinkBlocker;

           block_links_from; # this is exported by the plugin

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Create plugins for Dancer

</pre><h4><b>PLUGINS</b></h4><pre>
       You can extend Dancer by writing your own Plugin.

       A plugin is a module that exports a bunch of symbols to the current namespace (the caller will see all
       the symbols defined via "register").

       Note that you have to "use" the plugin wherever you want to use its symbols.  For instance, if you have
       Webapp::App1 and Webapp::App2, both loaded from your main application, they both need to "use FooPlugin"
       if they want to use the symbols exported by "FooPlugin".

   <b>METHODS</b>
       <b>register</b>
           Lets you define a keyword that will be exported by the plugin.

               register my_symbol_to_export =&gt; sub {
                   # ... some code
               };

       <b>register_plugin</b>
           A  Dancer  plugin  must end with this statement. This lets the plugin register all the symbols define
           with "register" as exported symbols (via the Exporter module).

           A Dancer plugin inherits from Dancer::Plugin and Exporter transparently.

       <b>register_hook</b>
           Allows a plugin to declare a list of supported hooks. Any hook declared like so can  be  executed  by
           the plugin with "execute_hooks".

               register_hook 'foo';
               register_hook 'foo', 'bar', 'baz';

       <b>execute_hooks</b>
           Allows a plugin to execute the hooks attached at the given position

               execute_hooks 'some_hook';

           The hook must have been registered by the plugin first, with "register_hook".

       <b>plugin_setting</b>
           Configuration for plugin should be structured like this in the config.yml of the application:

             plugins:
               plugin_name:
                 key: value

           If  "plugin_setting"  is  called inside a plugin, the appropriate configuration will be returned. The
           "plugin_name" should be the name of the package, or, if the plugin name is under the <b>Dancer::Plugin::</b>
           namespace (which is recommended), the remaining part of the plugin name.

           Enclose the remaining part in quotes if it contains ::, e.g.  for <b>Dancer::Plugin::Foo::Bar</b>, use:

             plugins:
               "Foo::Bar":
                 key: value

       <b>plugin_args</b>
           To easy migration and interoperability between Dancer 1 and Dancer 2  you  can  use  this  method  to
           obtain  the  arguments  or  parameters  passed to a plugin-defined keyword. Although not relevant for
           Dancer 1 only, or Dancer 2 only, plugins, it is useful for universal plugins.

             register foo =&gt; sub {
                my ($self, @args) = plugin_args(@_);
                ...
             }

           Note that Dancer 1 will return undef as the object reference.
