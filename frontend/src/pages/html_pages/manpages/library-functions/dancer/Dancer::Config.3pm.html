</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer::Config - how to configure Dancer to suit your needs

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.3521

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer::Config handles reading and changing the configuration of your Dancer apps.  The documentation for
       this module aims to describe how to change settings, and which settings are available.

</pre><h4><b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       You can change a setting with the keyword <b>set</b>, like the following:

           use Dancer;

           # changing default settings
           set port         =&gt; 8080;
           set content_type =&gt; 'text/plain';
           set startup_info =&gt; 0;

       A better way of defining settings exists: using YAML file. For this to be possible, you have to install
       the YAML module. If a file named <b>config.yml</b> exists in the application directory it will be loaded as a
       setting group.

       The same is done for the environment file located in the <b>environments</b> directory.

       To fetch the available configuration values use the <b>config</b> keyword that returns a reference to a hash:

           my $port   = config-&gt;{port};
           my $appdir = config-&gt;{appdir};

       By default, the module YAML will be used to parse the configuration files.  If desired, it is possible to
       use YAML::XS instead by changing the YAML engine configuration in the application code:

           config-&gt;{engines}{YAML}{module} = 'YAML::XS';

       See Dancer::Serializer::YAML for more details.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Run</b> <b>mode</b> <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>interface/port</b>
       <u>server</u> <u>(string)</u>

       The IP address that the Dancer app should bind to.  Default is 0.0.0.0, i.e.  bind to all available
       interfaces.

       Can also be set with environment variable DANCER_SERVER

       <u>port</u> <u>(int)</u>

       The port Dancer will listen to.

       Default value is 3000. This setting can be changed on the command-line with the <b>--port</b> switch.

       Can also be set with environment variable DANCER_PORT

       <u>daemon</u> <u>(boolean)</u>

       If set to true, runs the standalone webserver in the background.  This setting can be changed on the
       command-line with the <b>--daemon</b> flag.

       Can also be enabled by setting environment variable DANCER_DAEMON to a true value.

       <u>behind_proxy</u> <u>(boolean)</u>

       If set to true, Dancer will look to "X-Forwarded-Protocol" and "X-Forwarded-host" when constructing URLs
       (for example, when using "redirect". This is useful if your application is behind a proxy.

       It will also cause Dancer::Request-&gt;address to return what Dancer::Request-&gt;forwarded_for_address would
       return, namely the content of the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` env var/header, so that requests will appear to
       have come from the end user's IP and not the proxy's.

       Because of the above, you should *not* turn this on if your app isn't behind a proxy which will pass this
       information on appropriately, otherwise a malicious user could supply false information.

   <b>Content</b> <b>type</b> <b>/</b> <b>character</b> <b>set</b>
       <u>content_type</u> <u>(string)</u>

       The default content type of outgoing content.  Default value is 'text/html'.

       Can also be set with environment variable DANCER_CONTENT_TYPE

       <u>charset</u> <u>(string)</u>

       This setting has multiple effects:

       •   It  sets  the  default  charset  of  outgoing  content. "charset=" item will be added to Content-Type
           response header.

       •   It makes Unicode bodies in HTTP responses of "text/*" types to be encoded to this charset.

       •   It also indicates to Dancer in which charset the static files and templates are encoded.

       •   If you're using Dancer::Plugin::Database, UTF-8  support  will  automatically  be  enabled  for  your
           database - see "AUTOMATIC UTF-8 SUPPORT" in Dancer::Plugin::Database

       Default  value is empty which means don't do anything. HTTP responses without charset will be interpreted
       as ISO-8859-1 by most clients.

       You can cancel any charset processing by specifying  your  own  charset  in  Content-Type  header  or  by
       ensuring  that  response body leaves your handler without Unicode flag set (by encoding it into some 8bit
       charset, for example).

       Also, since automatically serialized JSON responses  have  "application/json"  Content-Type,  you  should
       always encode them by hand.

       Can also be set with environment variable DANCER_CHARSET

       <u>default_mime_type</u> <u>(string)</u>

       Dancer's  Dancer::MIME  module uses "application/data" as a default mime type. This setting lets the user
       change it. For example, if you have a lot of files being served in the <b>public</b> folder that do not have  an
       extension, and are text files, set the "default_mime_type" to "text/plain".

   <b>File</b> <b>/</b> <b>directory</b> <b>locations</b>
       <u>environment</u> <u>(string)</u>

       This  is  the  name  of  the  environment  that  should  be  used.  Standard  Dancer applications have an
       "environments" folder with specific configuration files for different environments  (usually  development
       and  production  environments). They specify different kinds of error reporting, deployment details, etc.
       These files are read after the generic "config.yml" configuration file.

       The running environment can be set with:

          set environment =&gt; "production";

       Note that this variable is also used as a default value if other values are not defined.

       Can also be set with environment variable DANCER_ENVIRONMENT

       <u>appdir</u> <u>(directory)</u>

       This is the path where your application will live.  It's where Dancer  will  look  by  default  for  your
       config files, templates and static content.

       It is typically set by "use Dancer" to use the same directory as your script.

       Can also be set with environment variable DANCER_APPDIR

       <u>public</u> <u>(directory)</u>

       This  is the directory, where static files are stored. Any existing file in that directory will be served
       as a static file, before matching any route.

       By default it points to $appdir/public.

       <u>views</u> <u>(directory)</u>

       This is the directory where your templates and layouts live.  It's the "view" part of MVC  (model,  view,
       controller).

       This defaults to $appdir/views.

   <b>Templating</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>layouts</b>
       <u>template</u>

       Allows you to configure which template engine should be used.  For instance, to use Template Toolkit, add
       the following to "config.yml":

           template: template_toolkit

       <u>layout</u> <u>(string)</u>

       The  name  of  the  layout  to  use  when rendering view. Dancer will look for a matching template in the
       directory $views/layouts.

       Your can override the default layout using the third argument of the "template" keyword.  Check  "Dancer"
       manpage for details.

   <b>Logging,</b> <b>debugging</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> <b>handling</b>
       <u>strict_config</u> <u>(boolean,</u> <u>default:</u> <u>false)</u>

       If  true, "config" will return an object instead of a hash reference. See Dancer::Config::Object for more
       information.

       <u>global_warnings</u> <u>(boolean,</u> <u>default:</u> <u>false)</u>

       If true, "use warnings" will be in effect for all modules and scripts loaded by your Dancer  application.
       Default is false.

       Can also be enabled by setting the environment variable DANCER_WARNINGS to a true value.

       <u>startup_info</u> <u>(boolean)</u>

       If set to true (the default), prints a banner at server startup with information such as versions and the
       environment (or "dancefloor").

       Can also be disabled by setting the environment variable DANCER_NO_STARTUP_INFO to a true value.

       <u>warnings</u> <u>(boolean)</u>

       If set to true, tells Dancer to consider all warnings as blocking errors. Default is false.

       <u>traces</u> <u>(boolean)</u>

       If  set  to  true, Dancer will display full stack traces when a warning or a die occurs. (Internally sets
       Carp::Verbose). Default is false.

       Can also be enabled by setting environment variable DANCER_TRACES to a true value.

       <u>require_environment</u> <u>(boolean)</u>

       If set to true, Dancer will fail during startup if your environment file is missing  or  can't  be  read.
       This  is especially useful in production when you have things like memcached settings that need to be set
       per-environment.  Defaults to false.

       <u>server_tokens</u> <u>(boolean)</u>

       If set to true (the default), Dancer will add an "X-Powered-By" header and also append the Dancer version
       to the "Server" header.

       Can also be disabled by setting the environment variable DANCER_NO_SERVER_TOKENS to a true value.

       <u>log_path</u> <u>(string)</u>

       Folder where the ``file "logger"'' saves log files.

       <u>log_file</u> <u>(string)</u>

       Name of the file to create when ``file "logger"'' is active. It defaults  to  the  "environment"  setting
       contents.

       <u>logger</u> <u>(enum)</u>

       Select which logger to use.  For example, to write to log files in "log_path":

           logger: file

       Or to direct log messages to the console from which you started your Dancer app in standalone mode,

           logger: console

       Various    other   logger   backends   are   available   on   CPAN,   including   Dancer::Logger::Syslog,
       Dancer::Logger::Log4perl, Dancer::Logger::PSGI (which can, with the aid of Plack  middlewares,  send  log
       messages to a browser's console window) and others.

       Can also be set with environment variable DANCER_LOGGER

       <u>log</u> <u>(enum)</u>

       Tells which log messages should be actually logged. Possible values are <b>core</b>, <b>debug</b>, <b>warning</b> or <b>error</b>.

       <b>core</b> : all messages are logged, including some from Dancer itself
       <b>debug</b> : all messages are logged
       <b>info</b> : only info, warning and error messages are logged
       <b>warning</b> : only warning and error messages are logged
       <b>error</b> : only error messages are logged

       During development, you'll probably want to use "debug" to see your own debug messages, and "core" if you
       need to see what Dancer is doing.  In production, you'll likely want "error" or "warning" only, for less-
       chatty logs.

       <u>show_errors</u> <u>(boolean)</u>

       If  set to true, Dancer will render a detailed debug screen whenever an error is caught. If set to false,
       Dancer will render the default error page, using $public/$error_code.html if it exists  or  the  template
       specified by the "error_template" setting.

       The  error  screen  attempts  to  sanitise sensitive looking information (passwords / card numbers in the
       request, etc) but you still should not have show_errors enabled whilst in production, as there is still a
       risk of divulging details.

       <u>error_template</u> <u>(template</u> <u>path)</u>

       This setting lets you specify a template to be used in case of runtime error. At the present  moment  the
       template can use three variables:

       <b>title</b>
           The error title.

       <b>message</b>
           The error message.

       <b>code</b>
           The code throwing that error.

   <b>Session</b> <b>engine</b>
       <u>session</u> <u>(enum)</u>

       This  setting lets you enable a session engine for your web application. By default sessions are disabled
       in Dancer. You must choose a session engine to use them.

       See Dancer::Session for supported engines and their respective configuration.

       <u>session_expires</u>

       The session expiry time in seconds, or as e.g. "2 hours" (see "expires" in  Dancer::Cookie.   By  default
       there is no specific expiry time.

       <u>session_name</u>

       The name of the cookie to store the session ID in.  Defaults to "dancer.session".  This can be overridden
       by certain session engines.

       <u>session_secure</u>

       The user's session ID is stored in a cookie.  If the "session_secure" setting is set to a true value, the
       cookie will be marked as secure, meaning it should only be sent over HTTPS connections.

       <u>session_is_http_only</u>

       This  setting  defaults  to  1  and instructs the session cookie to be created with the "HttpOnly" option
       active, meaning that JavaScript will not be able to access its value.

       <u>session_domain</u>

       Allows you to set the domain property on the cookie, which will override the default.  This is useful for
       setting the session cookie's domain to something like ".domain.com" so  that  the  same  cookie  will  be
       applicable and usable across subdomains of a base domain.

       <u>session_same_site</u>

       If set, session cookies will have the SameSite attribute set to the specified value to control cross-site
       request cookie handling.  If set, the value must be one of the values described in RFC6265bis - 'Strict',
       'Lax' or 'None'.

       "Strict" - Cookies will only be sent in a first-party context and not be sent along with requests
       initiated by third party websites.
       "Lax" - Cookies are allowed to be sent with top-level navigations and will be sent along with GET request
       initiated by third party website. This is the default value in modern browsers.
       "None" - Cookies will be sent in all contexts, i.e sending cross-origin is allowed.

   <b>auto_page</b> <b>(boolean)</b>
       For  simple  pages  where you're not doing anything dynamic, but still want to use the template engine to
       provide headers etc, you can use the auto_page feature to avoid the need to create a route for each page.

       With "auto_page" enabled, if the requested path does not match any specific route, Dancer will  check  in
       the views directory for a matching template, and use it to satisfy the request if found.

       Simply enable auto_page in your config:

           auto_page: 1

       Then, if you request "/foo/bar", Dancer will look in the views dir for "/foo/bar.tt".

       Dancer  will honor your "before_template_render" code, and all default variables. They will be accessible
       and interpolated on automaticly-served pages.

       The pages served this way will have "Content-Type" set to "text/html",  so  don't  use  the  feature  for
       anything else.

   <b>Route</b> <b>caching</b>
       <u>route_cache</u> <u>(boolean)</u>

       If  true, enables route caching (for quicker route resolution on larger apps - not caching of responses).
       See Dancer::Route::Cache for details. Default is false.

       <u>route_cache_size_limit</u> <u>(bytes)</u>

       Maximum size of route cache (e.g. 1024, 2M). Defaults to 10M (10MB) - see Dancer::Route::Cache

       <u>route_cache_path_limit</u> <u>(number)</u>

       Maximum number of routes to cache. Defaults to 600 - see Dancer::Route::Cache

   <b>DANCER_CONFDIR</b> <b>and</b> <b>DANCER_ENVDIR</b>
       It's possible to set the configuration directory and environment directory using  these  two  environment
       variables. Setting `DANCER_CONFDIR` will have the same effect as doing

           set confdir =&gt; '/path/to/confdir'

       and setting `DANCER_ENVDIR` will be similar to:

           set envdir =&gt; '/path/to/environments'

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Some  settings  can  be  provided via environment variables at runtime, as detailed above; a full list of
       environment variables you can use follows.
