</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Finance::QuoteHist - Perl module for fetching historical stock quotes.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Finance::QuoteHist;
         $q = Finance::QuoteHist-&gt;new
            (
             symbols    =&gt; [qw(IBM UPS AMZN)],
             start_date =&gt; '01/01/2009', # or '1 year ago', see Date::Manip
             end_date   =&gt; 'today',
            );

         # Quotes
         foreach $row ($q-&gt;quotes()) {
           ($symbol, $date, $open, $high, $low, $close, $volume) = @$row;
           ...
         }

         # Splits
         foreach $row ($q-&gt;splits()) {
            ($symbol, $date, $post, $pre) = @$row;
         }

         # Dividends
         foreach $row ($q-&gt;dividends()) {
            ($symbol, $date, $dividend) = @$row;
         }

         # Culprit
         $fetch_class = $q-&gt;quote_source('IBM');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Finance::QuoteHist is a top level interface for fetching historical stock quotes from the web.

       It is actually a front end to modules based on Finance::QuoteHist::Generic, the main difference being
       that it has a default <u>lineup</u> of web sites from which to attempt quote retrieval. If the prospect of
       mixing data from multiple sites seems scary to you, then use one of the site-specific modules directly.

       Unless otherwise defined via the <u>lineup</u> attribute, this module will select a <u>lineup</u> for you, the default
       being:

           Finance::QutoeHist::Yahoo
           Finance::QutoeHist::Google

       Once instantiated, this module behaves identically to the first module in the <u>lineup</u>, sharing all of that
       module's methods.

       Most queries will likely be handled by the first module in the lineup.  If the site is down for some
       reason, or perhaps that site does not provide quotes for defunct ticker symbols, then the other sites in
       the lineup will be attempted.

       See <b>Finance::QuoteHist::<a href="../man3/Generic.3.html">Generic</a></b>(3) for gory details on all of the parameters and methods this module
       accepts. The basic interface is noted below.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The basic user interface consists of several methods, as seen in the example above. Those methods are:

       <b>quotes()</b>
           Returns a list of rows (or a reference to an array containing those rows, if in scalar context). Each
           row contains the <b>Symbol</b>, <b>Date</b>, <b>Open</b>, <b>High</b>, <b>Low</b>, <b>Close</b>, and <b>Volume</b> for that date.  Optionally, if non-
           adjusted values were requested, their will be an extra element at the end of the row for the <b>Adjusted</b>
           closing price.

       <b>dividends()</b>
           Returns a list of rows (or a reference to an array containing those rows, if in scalar context). Each
           row contains the <b>Date</b> and amount of the <b>Dividend</b>, in that order.

       <b>splits()</b>
           Returns a list of rows (or a reference to an array containing those rows, if in scalar context). Each
           row contains the <b>Date</b>, <b>Post</b> split shares, and <b>Pre</b> split shares, in that order.

       source($ticker, $target)
           Each  of these methods displays which site-specific class actually retrieved the information, if any,
           for a particular ticker symbol and target such as 'quote' (default), 'dividend', or 'split'.

</pre><h4><b>DISCLAIMER</b></h4><pre>
       The data returned from these modules is in no way guaranteed, nor are the developers responsible  in  any
       way  for  how  this  data (or lack thereof) is used. The interface is based on URLs and page layouts that
       might change  at  any  time.  Even  though  these  modules  are  designed  to  be  adaptive  under  these
       circumstances,  they will at some point probably be unable to retrieve data unless fixed or provided with
       new parameters.  Furthermore, the data from these web sites is usually not even  guaranteed  by  the  web
       sites  themselves,  and  oftentimes  is  acquired elsewhere. See the documentation for each site-specific
       module for more information regarding the disclaimer for that site.
