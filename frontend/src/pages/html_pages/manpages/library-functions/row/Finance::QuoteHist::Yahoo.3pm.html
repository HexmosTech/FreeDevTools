</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Finance::QuoteHist::Yahoo - Site-specific subclass for retrieving historical stock quotes.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Finance::QuoteHist::Yahoo;
         $q = new Finance::QuoteHist::Yahoo
            (
             symbols    =&gt; [qw(IBM UPS AMZN)],
             start_date =&gt; '01/01/2009',
             end_date   =&gt; 'today',
            );

         # Values
         foreach $row ($q-&gt;quotes()) {
           ($symbol, $date, $open, $high, $low, $close, $volume) = @$row;
           ...
         }

         # Splits
         foreach $row ($q-&gt;splits()) {
            ($symbol, $date, $post, $pre) = @$row;
         }

         # Dividends
         foreach $row ($q-&gt;dividends()) {
            ($symbol, $date, $dividend) = @$row;
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Finance::QuoteHist::Yahoo is a subclass of Finance::QuoteHist::Generic, specifically tailored to read
       historical quotes, dividends, and splits from the Yahoo web site (<u><a href="http://table.finance.yahoo.com/">http://table.finance.yahoo.com/</a></u>).

       For quotes and dividends, Yahoo can return data quickly in CSV format.  Both of these can also be
       extracted from HTML tables. Splits are extracted from the HTML of the 'Basic Chart' page for that ticker.

       There are no date range restrictions on CSV queries for quotes and dividends.

       For HTML queries, Yahoo takes arbitrary date ranges as arguments, but breaks results into pages of 66
       entries.

       Please see <b>Finance::QuoteHist::<a href="../man3/Generic.3.html">Generic</a></b>(3) for more details on usage and available methods. If you just
       want to get historical quotes and are not interested in the details of how it is done, check out
       <b>Finance::<a href="../man3/QuoteHist.3.html">QuoteHist</a></b>(3).

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The basic user interface consists of three methods, as seen in the example above. Those methods are:

       <b>quotes()</b>
           Returns a list of rows (or a reference to an array containing those rows, if in scalar context). Each
           row contains the <b>Symbol</b>, <b>Date</b>, <b>Open</b>, <b>High</b>, <b>Low</b>, <b>Close</b>, and <b>Volume</b> for that date.

       <b>dividends()</b>
           Returns a list of rows (or a reference to an array containing those rows, if in scalar context). Each
           row contains the <b>Symbol</b>, <b>Date</b>, and amount of the <b>Dividend</b>, in that order.

       <b>splits()</b>
           Returns a list of rows (or a reference to an array containing those rows, if in scalar context). Each
           row contains the <b>Symbol</b>, <b>Date</b>, <b>Post</b> split shares, and <b>Pre</b> split shares, in that order.

       The  following  methods override methods provided by the Finance::QuoteHist::Generic module; more of this
       was necessary than is typical for a basic query site due to the variety of query types and  data  formats
       available on Yahoo.

       <b>url_maker()</b>
           Returns  a subroutine reference tailored for the current target mode and parsing mode. The routine is
           an iterator that will produce all necessary URLs on repeated  invocations  necessary  to  complete  a
           query.

       <b>extractors()</b>
           Returns a hash of subroutine references that attempt to extract embedded values (dividends or splits)
           within the results from a larger query.

       <b>labels()</b>
           Includes the 'adj' column.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIRES</b></h4><pre>
       Finance::QuoteHist::Generic

</pre><h4><b>DISCLAIMER</b></h4><pre>
       The  data  returned from these modules is in no way guaranteed, nor are the developers responsible in any
       way for how this data (or lack thereof) is used. The interface is based on URLs  and  page  layouts  that
       might  change  at  any  time.  Even  though  these  modules  are  designed  to  be  adaptive  under these
       circumstances, they will at some point probably be unable to retrieve data unless fixed or provided  with
       new  parameters.  Furthermore,  the  data  from these web sites is usually not even guaranteed by the web
       sites themselves, and oftentimes is acquired elsewhere.

       If you would like to know more, check out the terms of service from Yahoo!, which can be found here:

         <a href="http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/">http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/</a>

       If you still have concerns, then use another site-specific historical quote instance, or none at all.

       Above all, play nice.
