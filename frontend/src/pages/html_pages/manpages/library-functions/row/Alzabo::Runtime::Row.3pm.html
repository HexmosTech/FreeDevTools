</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Alzabo::Runtime::Row - Row objects

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Alzabo::Runtime::Row;

         my $row = $table-&gt;row_by_pk( pk =&gt; 1 );

         $row-&gt;select('foo');

         $row-&gt;update( bar =&gt; 5 );

         $row-&gt;delete;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These objects represent actual rows from the database containing actual data.  In general, you will want
       to use the "Alzabo::Runtime::Table" object to retrieve rows.  The "Alzabo::Runtime::Table" object can
       return either single rows or row cursors.

</pre><h4><b>ROW</b> <b>STATES</b></h4><pre>
       Row objects can have a variety of states.  Most row objects are "live", which means they represent an
       actual row object.  A row can be changed to the "deleted" state by calling its "delete()" method.  This
       is a row that no longer exists in the database.  Most method calls on rows in this state cause an
       exception.

       There is also a "potential" state, for objects which do not represent actual database rows.  You can call
       "make_live()" on these rows in order to change their state to "live".

       Finally, there is an "in cache" state, which is identical to the "live" state, except that it is used for
       object's that are cached via the "Alzabo::Runtime::UniqueRowCache" class.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Row objects offer the following methods:

   <b>select</b> <b>(@list_of_column_names)</b>
       Returns a list of values matching the specified columns in a list context.  In scalar context it returns
       only a single value (the first column specified).

       If no columns are specified, it will return the values for all of the columns in the table, in the order
       that are returned by "Alzabo::Runtime::Table-&gt;columns".

       This method throws an "Alzabo::Runtime::NoSuchRowException" if called on a deleted row.

   <b>select_hash</b> <b>(@list_of_column_names)</b>
       Returns a hash of column names to values matching the specified columns.

       If no columns are specified, it will return the values for all of the columns in the table.

       This method throws an "Alzabo::Runtime::NoSuchRowException" if called on a deleted row.

   <b>update</b> <b>(%hash_of_columns_and_values)</b>
       Given a hash of columns and values, attempts to update the database to and the object to represent these
       new values.

       It returns a boolean value indicating whether or not any data was actually modified.

       This method throws an "Alzabo::Runtime::NoSuchRowException" if called on a deleted row.

   <b>refresh</b>
       Refreshes the object against the database.  This can be used when you want to ensure that a row object is
       up to date in regards to the database state.

       This method throws an "Alzabo::Runtime::NoSuchRowException" if called on a deleted row.

   <b>delete</b>
       Deletes the row from the RDBMS and changes the object's state to deleted.

       For potential rows, this method simply changes the object's state.

       This method throws an "Alzabo::Runtime::NoSuchRowException" if called on a deleted row.

   <b>id_as_string</b>
       Returns the row's id value as a string.  This can be passed to the "Alzabo::Runtime::Table-&gt;row_by_id"
       method to recreate the row later.

       For potential rows, this method always return an empty string.

       This method throws an "Alzabo::Runtime::NoSuchRowException" if called on a deleted row.

   <b>is_live</b>
       Indicates whether or not the given row represents an actual row in the database.

   <b>is_potential</b>
       Indicates whether or not the given row represents an actual row in the datatbase.

   <b>is_deleted</b>
       Indicates whether or not the given row has been deleted

   <b>table</b>
       Returns the "Alzabo::Runtime::Table" object that this row belongs to.

   <b>schema</b>
       Returns the "Alzabo::Runtime::Schema" object that this row's table belongs to.  This is a shortcut for
       "$row-&gt;table-&gt;schema".

   <b>rows_by_foreign_key</b>
       This method is used to retrieve row objects from other tables by "following" a relationship between two
       tables.

       It takes the following parameters:

       â€¢   foreign_key =&gt; "Alzabo::Runtime::ForeignKey" object

       Given  a foreign key object, this method returns either a row object or a row cursor object the row(s) in
       the table to which the relationship exist.

       The type of object returned is based on the cardinality of the relationship.  If  the  relationship  says
       that there could only be one matching row, then a row object is returned, otherwise it returns a cursor.

</pre><h4><b>POTENTIAL</b> <b>ROWS</b></h4><pre>
       The "potential" row state is used for rows which do not yet exist in the database.  These are created via
       the "Alzabo::Runtime::Table-&gt;potential_row" method.

       They  are  useful  when you need a placeholder object which you can update and select from, but you don't
       actually want to commit the data to the database.

       These objects are not cached.

       Once "make_live()" is called, the object's state becomes "live".

       Potential rows have looser constraints for  column  values  than  regular  rows.   When  creating  a  new
       potential  row,  it is ok if none of the columns are defined.  If a column has a default, and a value for
       that column is not given, then the default will be used.  However,  you  cannot  update  a  column  in  a
       potential row to undef (NULL) if the column is not nullable.

       No attempt is made to enforce referential integrity constraints on these objects.

       You  cannot  set  a column's value to a database function like "<b>NOW()</b>", because this requires interaction
       with the database.

   <b>make_live</b>
       This method inserts the row into the database and changes the object's state to "live".

       This means that all references to the potential row object will now be  references  to  the  real  object
       (which is a good thing).

       This method can take any parameters that can be passed to the "Alzabo::Runtime::Table-&gt;insert" method.

       Any  columns  already  set will be passed to the "insert" method, including primary key values.  However,
       these will be overridden, on a column by column basis, by a "pk" or  "values"  parameters  given  to  the
       "(make_live()" method.

       Calling   this   method   on  a  row  object  that  is  not  in  the  "potential"  state  will  cause  an
       "Alzabo::Runtime::LogicException"
