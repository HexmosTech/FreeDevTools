       Text::BibTeX::NameFormat - format BibTeX-style author names

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use Text::BibTeX::NameFormat;

          $format = Text::BibTeX::NameFormat-&gt;($parts, $abbrev_first);

          $format-&gt;set_text ($part,
                             $pre_part, $post_part,
                             $pre_token, $post_token);

          $format-&gt;set_options ($part, $abbrev, $join_tokens, $join_part

          ## Uses the encoding/binmode and normalization form stored in $name
          $formatted_name = $format-&gt;apply ($name);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       After splitting a name into its components parts (represented as a "Text::BibTeX::Name" object), you
       often want to put it back together again as a single string formatted in a consistent way.
       "Text::BibTeX::NameFormat" provides a very flexible way to do this, generally in two stages: first, you
       create a "name format" which describes how to put the tokens and parts of any name back together, and
       then you apply the format to a particular name.

       The "name format" is encapsulated in a "Text::BibTeX::NameFormat" object.  The constructor ("new")
       includes some clever behind-the-scenes trickery that means you can usually get away with calling it
       alone, and not need to do any customization of the format object.  If you do need to customize the
       format, though, the set_text() and set_options() methods provide that capability.

       Note that "Text::BibTeX::NameFormat" is a fairly direct translation of the name-formatting C interface in
       the <b>btparse</b> library.  This manual page is meant to provide enough information to use the Perl class, but
       for more details and examples, consult bt_format_names.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTANTS</b></h4><pre>
       Two enumerated types for dealing with names and name formatting have been brought from C into Perl.  In
       the <b>btparse</b> documentation, you'll see references to "bt_namepart" and "bt_joinmethod".  The former lists
       the four "parts" of a BibTeX name: first, von, last, and jr; its values (in both C and Perl) are
       "BTN_FIRST", "BTN_VON", "BTN_LAST", and "BTN_JR".  The latter lists the ways in which bt_format_name()
       (the C function that corresponds to "Text::BibTeX::NameFormat"'s "apply" method) can join adjacent tokens
       together: "BTJ_MAYTIE", "BTJ_SPACE", "BTJ_FORCETIE", and "BTJ_NOTHING".  Both sets of values may be
       imported from the "Text::BibTeX" module, using the import tags "nameparts" and "joinmethods".  For
       instance:

          use Text::BibTeX qw(:nameparts :joinmethods);
          use Text::BibTeX::Name;
          use Text::BibTeX::NameFormat;

       The "name part" constants are used to specify surrounding text or formatting options on a per-part basis:
       for instance, you can supply the "pre-token" text, or the "abbreviate" flag, for a single part without
       affecting other parts.  The "join methods" are two of the three formatting options that you can set for a
       part: you can control how to join the individual tokens of a name ("JR Smith", or "J R Smith", or "J~R
       Smith", and you can control how the final token of one part is joined to the next part ("la Roche" versus
       "la~Roche").

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new(PARTS, ABBREV_FIRST)
           Creates  a  new  name format, with the two most common customizations: which parts to include (and in
           what order), and whether to abbreviate the first name.  PARTS should be a string with  at  most  four
           characters,  one  representing  each  part  that  you  want to occur in a formatted name (defaults to
           "fvlj").  For example, "fvlj" means to format names in  "first  von  last  jr"  order,  while  "vljf"
           denotes "von last jr first."  ABBREV_FIRST is just a boolean value: false to print out the first name
           in  full,  and  true  to  abbreviate  it with periods after each token and discretionary ties between
           tokens (defaults to false).  All intra- and inter-token  punctuation  and  spacing  is  independently
           controllable   with  the  "set_text"  and  "set_options"  methods,  although  these  will  rarely  be
           necessary---sensible defaults are chosen for everything, based on the PARTS and  ABBREV_FIRST  values
           that  you supply.  See the description of bt_create_name_format() in bt_format_names for full details
           of the choices made.

       set_text (PART, PRE_PART, POST_PART, PRE_TOKEN, POST_TOKEN)
           Allows you to customize some or all of the surrounding text for a single name part.  Every name  part
           has  four  possible chunks of text that go around or within it: before/after the part as a whole, and
           before/after each token in the part.  For instance, if you are abbreviating first names and  wish  to
           control the punctuation after each token in the first name, you would set the "post token" text:

              $format-&gt;set_text ('first', undef, undef, undef, '');

           would  set  the post-token text to the empty string, resulting in names like "J R Smith".  (Normally,
           abbreviated first names will have a period after each token: "J. R.  Smith".)   Note  that  supplying
           "undef" for the other three values leaves them unchanged.

           See bt_format_names for full information on formatting names.

       set_options (PART, ABBREV, JOIN_TOKENS, JOIN_PART)
           Allows  further  customization of a name format: you can set the abbreviation flag and the two token-
           join methods.  Alas, there is no mechanism for leaving a value unchanged;  you  must  set  everything
           with "set_options".

           For  example,  let's  say  that just dropping periods from abbreviated tokens in the first name isn't
           enough; you <u>really</u> want to save space by jamming the abbreviated tokens together: "JR  Smith"  rather
           than  "J  R  Smith"   Assuming  the two calls in the above example have been done, the following will
           finish the job:

              $format-&gt;set_options (BTN_FIRST,
                                    1,             # keep same value for abbrev flag
                                    BTJ_NOTHING,   # jam tokens together
                                    BTJ_SPACE);    # space after final token of part

           Note that we unfortunately had to know (and supply) the current values for the abbreviation flag  and
           post-part join method, even though we were only setting the intra-part join method.

       apply (NAME)
           Once  a name format has been created and customized to your heart's content, you can use it to format
           any number of names using the "apply" method.  NAME must be a "Text::BibTeX::Name"  object  (i.e.,  a
           pre-split name); "apply" returns a string containing the parts of the name formatted according to the
           "Text::BibTeX::NameFormat" structure it is called on.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Although  the process of splitting and formatting names may sound complicated and convoluted from reading
       the above (along with Text::BibTeX::Name), it's actually quite simple.  There are really only three steps
       to worry about: split the name (create a "Text::BibTeX::Name" object), create and  customize  the  format
       ("Text::BibTeX::NameFormat" object), and apply the format to the name.

       The first step is covered in Text::BibTeX::Name; here's a brief example:

          $orig_name = 'Charles Louis Xavier Joseph de la Vall{\'e}e Poussin';
          $name = Text::BibTeX::Name-&gt;new($orig_name);

       The  various  parts  of  the  name can now be accessed through "Text::BibTeX::Name" methods; for instance
       "$name-&gt;part('von')" returns the list "("de","la")".

       Creating the name format is equally simple:

          $format = Text::BibTeX::NameFormat-&gt;new('vljf', 1);

       creates a format that will print the name in "von last jr first" order, with the first name  abbreviated.
       And  for  no  extra  charge, you get the right punctuation at the right place: a comma before any `jr' or
       `first' tokens, and periods after each `first' token.

       For instance, we can perform no further customization on this format, and apply it immediately to  $name.
       There  are  in  fact  two  ways  to  do  this, depending on whether you prefer to think of it in terms of
       "Applying  the  format   to   a   name"   or   "formatting   a   name".    The   first   is   done   with
       "Text::BibTeX::NameFormat"'s "apply" method:

          $formatted_name = $format-&gt;apply ($name);

       while the second uses "Text::BibTeX::Name"'s "format" method:

          $formatted_name = $name-&gt;format ($format);

       which  is  just  a wrapper around "Text::BibTeX::NameFormat::apply".  In either case, the result with the
       example name and format shown is

          de~la Vall{\'e}e~Poussin, C.~L. X.~J.

       Note the strategic insertion of TeX "ties" (non-breakable spaces) at sensitive spots in the  name.   (The
       exact rules for insertion of discretionary ties are given in bt_format_names.)
