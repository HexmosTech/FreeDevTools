       Text::BibTeX::Name - interface to BibTeX-style author names

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use Text::BibTeX::Name;

          $name = Text::BibTeX::Name-&gt;new();
          $name-&gt;split('J. Random Hacker');
          # or:
          $name = Text::BibTeX::Name-&gt;new('J. Random Hacker');

          @firstname_tokens = $name-&gt;part ('first');
          $lastname = join (' ', $name-&gt;part ('last'));

          $format = Text::BibTeX::NameFormat-&gt;new();
          # ...customize $format...
          $formatted = $name-&gt;format ($format);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Text::BibTeX::Name" provides an abstraction for BibTeX-style names and some basic operations on them.  A
       name, in the BibTeX world, consists of a list of <u>tokens</u> which are divided amongst four <u>parts</u>: `first',
       `von', `last', and `jr'.

       Tokens are separated by whitespace or commas at brace-level zero.  Thus the name

          van der Graaf, Horace Q.

       has five tokens, whereas the name

          {Foo, Bar, and Sons}

       consists of a single token.  Skip down to "EXAMPLES" for more examples, or read on if you want to know
       the exact details of how names are split into tokens and parts.

       How tokens are divided into parts depends on the form of the name.  If the name has no commas at brace-
       level zero (as in the second example), then it is assumed to be in either "first last" or "first von
       last" form.  If there are no tokens that start with a lower-case letter, then "first last" form is
       assumed: the final token is the last name, and all other tokens form the first name.  Otherwise, the
       earliest contiguous sequence of tokens with initial lower-case letters is taken as the `von' part; if
       this sequence includes the final token, then a warning is printed and the final token is forced to be the
       `last' part.

       If a name has a single comma, then it is assumed to be in "von last, first" form.  A leading sequence of
       tokens with initial lower-case letters, if any, forms the `von' part; tokens between the `von' and the
       comma form the `last' part; tokens following the comma form the `first' part.  Again, if there are no
       tokens following a leading sequence of lowercase tokens, a warning is printed and the token immediately
       preceding the comma is taken to be the `last' part.

       If a name has more than two commas, a warning is printed and the name is treated as though only the first
       two commas were present.

       Finally, if a name has two commas, it is assumed to be in "von last, jr, first" form.  (This is the only
       way to represent a name with a `jr' part.)  The parsing of the name is the same as for a one-comma name,
       except that tokens between the two commas are taken to be the `jr' part.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEAT</b></h4><pre>
       The C code that does the actual work of splitting up names takes a shortcut and makes few assumptions
       about whitespace.  In particular, there must be no leading whitespace, no trailing whitespace, no
       consecutive whitespace characters in the string, and no whitespace characters other than space.  In other
       words, all whitespace must consist of lone internal spaces.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The strings "John Smith" and "Smith, John" are different representations of the same name, so split into
       parts and tokens the same way, namely as:

          first =&gt; ('John')
          von   =&gt; ()
          last  =&gt; ('Smith')
          jr    =&gt; ()

       Note that every part is a list of tokens, even if there is only one token in that part; empty parts get
       empty token lists.  Every token is just a string.  Writing this example in actual code is simple:

          $name = Text::BibTeX::Name-&gt;new("John Smith");  # or "Smith, John"
          $name-&gt;part ('first');       # returns list ("John")
          $name-&gt;part ('last');        # returns list ("Smith")
          $name-&gt;part ('von');         # returns list ()
          $name-&gt;part ('jr');          # returns list ()

       (We'll omit the empty parts in the rest of the examples: just assume that any unmentioned part is an
       empty list.)  If more than two tokens are included and there's no comma, they'll go to the first name:
       thus "John Q. Smith" splits into

          first =&gt; ("John", "Q."))
          last  =&gt; ("Smith")

       and "J. R. R. Tolkein" into

          first =&gt; ("J.", "R.", "R.")
          last  =&gt; ("Tolkein")

       The ambiguous name "Kevin Philips Bong" splits into

          first =&gt; ("Kevin", "Philips")
          last  =&gt; ("Bong")

       which may or may not be the right thing, depending on the particular person.  There's no way to know
       though, so if this fellow's last name is "Philips Bong" and not "Bong", the string representation of his
       name must disambiguate.  One possibility is "Philips Bong, Kevin" which splits into

          first =&gt; ("Kevin")
          last  =&gt; ("Philips", "Bong")

       Alternately, "Kevin {Philips Bong}" takes advantage of the fact that tokes are only split on whitespace
       <u>at</u> <u>brace-level</u> <u>zero</u>, and becomes

          first =&gt; ("Kevin")
          last  =&gt; ("{Philips Bong}")

       which is fine if your names are destined to be processed by TeX, but might be problematic in other
       contexts.  Similarly, "St John-Mollusc, Oliver" becomes

          first =&gt; ("Oliver")
          last  =&gt; ("St", "John-Mollusc")

       which can also be written as "Oliver {St John-Mollusc}":

          first =&gt; ("Oliver")
          last  =&gt; ("{St John-Mollusc}")

       Since tokens are separated purely by whitespace, hyphenated names will work either way: both "Nigel
       Incubator-Jones" and "Incubator-Jones, Nigel" come out as

          first =&gt; ("Nigel")
          last  =&gt; ("Incubator-Jones")

       Multi-token last names with lowercase components -- the "von part" -- work fine: both "Ludwig van
       Beethoven" and "van Beethoven, Ludwig" parse (correctly) into

          first =&gt; ("Ludwig")
          von   =&gt; ("van")
          last  =&gt; ("Beethoven")

       This allows these European aristocratic names to sort properly, i.e. <u>van</u> <u>Beethoven</u> under <u>B</u> rather than <u>v</u>.
       Speaking of aristocratic European names, "Charles Louis Xavier Joseph de la Vall{\'e}e Poussin" is
       handled just fine, and splits into

          first =&gt; ("Charles", "Louis", "Xavier", "Joseph")
          von   =&gt; ("de", "la")
          last  =&gt; ("Vall{\'e}e", "Poussin")

       so could be sorted under <u>V</u> rather than <u>d</u>.  (Note that the sorting algorithm in Text::BibTeX::BibSort is a
       slavish imitiation of BibTeX 0.99, and therefore does the wrong thing with these names: the sort key
       starts with the "von" part.)

       However, capitalized "von parts" don't work so well: "R. J. Van de Graaff" splits into

          first =&gt; ("R.", "J.", "Van")
          von   =&gt; ("de")
          last  =&gt; ("Graaff")

       which is clearly wrong.  This name should be represented as "Van de Graaff, R. J."

          first =&gt; ("R.", "J.")
          last  =&gt; ("Van", "de", "Graaff")

       which is probably right.  (This particular Van de Graaff was an American, so he probably belongs under <u>V</u>
       -- which is where my (British) dictionary puts him.  Other Van de Graaff's mileages may vary.)

       Finally, many names include a suffix: "Jr.", "III", "fils", and so forth.  These are handled, but with
       some limitations.  If there's a comma before the suffix (the usual U.S. convention for "Jr."), then the
       name should be in <u>last,</u> <u>jr,</u> <u>first</u> form, e.g. "Doe, Jr., John" comes out (correctly) as

          first =&gt; ("John")
          last  =&gt; ("Doe")
          jr    =&gt; ("Jr.")

       but "John Doe, Jr." is ambiguous and is parsed as

          first =&gt; ("Jr.")
          last  =&gt; ("John", "Doe")

       (so don't do it that way).  If there's no comma before the suffix -- the usual for Roman numerals, and
       occasionally seen with "Jr." -- then you're stuck and have to make the suffix part of the last name.
       Thus, "Gates III, William H." comes out

          first =&gt; ("William", "H.")
          last  =&gt; ("Gates", "III")

       but "William H. Gates III" is ambiguous, and becomes

          first =&gt; ("William", "H.", "Gates")
          last  =&gt; ("III")

       -- not what you want.  Again, the curly-brace trick comes in handy, so "William H. {Gates III}" splits
       into

          first =&gt; ("William", "H.")
          last  =&gt; ("{Gates III}")

       There is no way to make a comma-less suffix the "jr" part.  (This is an unfortunate consequence of
       slavishly imitating BibTeX 0.99.)

       Finally, names that aren't really names of people but rather are organization or company names should be
       forced into a single token by wrapping them in curly braces.  For example, "Foo, Bar and Sons" should be
       written "{Foo, Bar and Sons}", which will split as

          last  =&gt; ("{Foo, Bar and Sons}")

       Of course, if this is one name in a BibTeX "authors" or "editors" list, this name has to be wrapped in
       braces anyways (because of the " and "), but that's another story.

</pre><h4><b>FORMATTING</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       Putting a split-up name back together again in a flexible, customizable way is the job of another module:
       see Text::BibTeX::NameFormat.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new([ [OPTS,] NAME [, FILENAME, LINE, NAME_NUM]])
           Creates  a  new  "Text::BibTeX::Name"  object.  If NAME is supplied, it must be a string containing a
           single name, and it will be be passed to the "split" method for further processing.  FILENAME,  LINE,
           and NAME_NUM, if present, are all also passed to "split" to allow better error messages.

           If  the  first argument is a hash reference, it is used to define configuration values. At the moment
           the available values are:

           BINMODE
               Set the way Text::BibTeX deals with strings. By default it manages strings as bytes. You can  set
               BINMODE  to  'utf-8'  to get NFC normalized UTF-8 strings and you can customise the normalization
               with the NORMALIZATION option.

                  Text::BibTeX::Name-&gt;new(
                     { binmode =&gt; 'utf-8', normalization =&gt; 'NFD' },
                     "Alberto Simões"});

       split (NAME [, FILENAME, LINE, NAME_NUM])
           Splits NAME (a string containing a single name) into tokens and subsequently into the four parts of a
           BibTeX-style name (first, von, last, and jr).  (Each part  is  a  list  of  tokens,  and  tokens  are
           separated  by  whitespace or commas at brace-depth zero.  See above for full details on how a name is
           split into its component parts.)

           The token-lists that make up each part of the name are then stored in the "Text::BibTeX::Name" object
           for later retrieval or formatting with the "part" and "format" methods.

       part (PARTNAME)
           Returns the list of tokens in part PARTNAME of a name previously split with  "split".   For  example,
           suppose a "Text::BibTeX::Name" object is created and initialized like this:

              $name = Text::BibTeX::Name-&gt;new();
              $name-&gt;split ('Charles Louis Xavier Joseph de la Vall{\'e}e Poussin');

           Then this code:

              $name-&gt;part ('von');

           would return the list "('de','la')".

       format (FORMAT)
           Formats   a   name   according   to   the  specifications  encoded  in  FORMAT,  which  should  be  a
           "Text::BibTeX::NameFormat" (or descendant) object.  (In short, it must supply a method "apply"  which
           takes  a  "Text::BibTeX::NameFormat"  object  as its only argument.)  Returns the formatted name as a
           string.

           See Text::BibTeX::NameFormat for full details on formatting names.
