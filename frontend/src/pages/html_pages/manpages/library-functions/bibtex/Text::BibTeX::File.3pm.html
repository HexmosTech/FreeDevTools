       Text::BibTeX::File - interface to whole BibTeX files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use Text::BibTeX::File;

          $bib = Text::BibTeX::File-&gt;new("foo.bib") or die "foo.bib: $!\n";
          # or:
          $bib =  Text::BibTeX::File-&gt;new;
          $bib-&gt;open("foo.bib", {binmode =&gt; 'utf-8', normalization =&gt; 'NFC'}) || die "foo.bib: $!\n";

          $bib-&gt;set_structure ($structure_name,
                               $option1 =&gt; $value1, ...);

          $at_eof = $bib-&gt;eof;

          $bib-&gt;close;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Text::BibTeX::File" provides an object-oriented interface to BibTeX files.  Its most obvious purpose is
       to keep track of a filename and filehandle together for use by the "Text::BibTeX::Entry" module (which is
       much more interesting).  In addition, it allows you to specify certain options which are applicable to a
       whole database (file), rather than having to specify them for each entry in the file.  Currently, you can
       specify the <u>database</u> <u>structure</u> and some <u>structure</u> <u>options</u>.  These concepts are fully documented in
       Text::BibTeX::Structure.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Object</b> <b>creation,</b> <b>file</b> <b>operations</b>
       new ([FILENAME], [OPTS])
           Creates  a  new "Text::BibTeX::File" object.  If FILENAME is supplied, passes it to the "open" method
           (along with OPTS).  If the "open" fails, "new" fails and returns false; if the "open" succeeds (or if
           FILENAME isn't supplied), "new" returns the new object reference.

       open (FILENAME [OPTS])
           Opens the file specified by FILENAME. OPTS is an hashref that can have the following values:

           MODE
               mode as specified by IO::File

           PERMS
               permissions as specified by IO::File. Can only be used in conjunction with "MODE"

           BINMODE
               By default, Text::BibTeX uses bytes directly. Thus, you need to encode strings  accordingly  with
               the  encoding of the files you are reading. You can also select UTF-8. In this case, Text::BibTeX
               will return UTF-8 strings in NFC mode. Note that at the moment files with BOM are not supported.

               Valid values are 'raw/bytes' or 'utf-8'.

           NORMALIZATION
               By default, Text::BibTeX outputs UTF-8 in NFC form. You can change this by passing the name of  a
               different form.

               Valid values are those forms supported by the Unicode::Normalize module ('NFD', 'NFDK' etc.)

           RESET_MACROS
               By  default, Text::BibTeX accumulates macros. This means that when you open a second file, macros
               defined by the first are still available. This may result on warnings of macros being redefined.

               This option can be used to force Text::BibTeX to clean up all macros definitions (except for  the
               month macros).

       close ()
           Closes  the  filehandle associated with the object.  If there is no such filehandle (i.e., "open" was
           never called on the object), does nothing.

       eof ()
           Returns the end-of-file state of the filehandle associated with the object: a true value means we are
           at the end of the file.

   <b>Object</b> <b>properties</b>
       set_structure (STRUCTURE [, OPTION =&gt; VALUE, ...])
           Sets the database structure for a BibTeX file.  At the simplest level, this means that  entries  from
           the  file are expected to conform to certain field requirements as specified by the <u>structure</u> <u>module</u>.
           It also gives you full access to the methods of  the  particular  <u>structured</u>  <u>entry</u>  <u>class</u>  for  this
           structure,  allowing  you  to  perform  operations  specific  to  this  kind of database.  See "CLASS
           INTERACTIONS" in Text::BibTeX::Structure for all the consequences of setting the  database  structure
           for a "Text::BibTeX::File" object.

       structure ()
           Returns the name of the database structure associated with the object (as set by "set_structure").

       preserve_values ([PRESERVE])
           Sets  the  "preserve  values"  flag,  to  control  all  future parsing of entries from this file.  If
           PRESERVE isn't supplied, returns the current state of the flag.  See Text::BibTeX::Value for  details
           on parsing in "value preservation" mode.
