</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       WWW::SearchResult - class for results returned from WWW::Search

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           require WWW::Search;
           require WWW::SearchResult;
           $search = new WWW::Search;
           $search-&gt;native_query(WWW::Search::escape_query($query));
           # Get first result:
           $result = $search-&gt;next_result();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A framework for returning the results of "WWW::Search".

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       WWW::Search

</pre><h4><b>REQUIRED</b> <b>RESULTS</b></h4><pre>
       The particular fields returned in a result are backend- (search engine-) dependent.  However, all search
       engines are required to return a url and title.  (This list may grow in the future.)

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       To create a new WWW::SearchResult, call

           $result = new WWW::SearchResult();

   <b>url</b>
       Returns the primary URL.  Note that there may be a list of urls, see also methods "urls" and "add_url".
       Nothing special is guaranteed about the primary URL other than that it is the first one returned by the
       back end.

       Every result is required to have at least one URL.

   <b>add_url</b>
       Add a URL to the list.

   <b>urls</b>
       Return a reference to the list of urls.  There is also a primary URL ("url").

   <b>add_related_url</b>
       Add a URL to the related_url list.

   <b>related_urls</b>
       Return a reference to the list of related urls.

   <b>add_related_title</b>
       Add a title to the list or related titles.

   <b>related_titles</b>
       Return a reference to the list of related titles.

   <b>title,</b> <b>description,</b> <b>score,</b> <b>change_date,</b> <b>index_date,</b> <b>size,</b> <b>raw</b>
       Set or get attributes of the result.

       None of these attributes is guaranteed to be provided by a given backend.  If an attribute is not
       provided its method will return "undef".

       Typical contents of these attributes:

       title   The title of the hit result (typically that provided by the 'TITLE' HTML tag).

       description
               A  brief  description  of the result, as provided (or not) by the search engine.  Often the first
               few sentences of the document.

       source  Source is either the base url for this result (as listed on the search engine's results page)  or
               another  copy of the full url path of the result.  It might also indicate the source site name or
               address whence the result came, for example, 'CNN' or '<a href="http://www.cnn.com">http://www.cnn.com</a>' if the  search  result
               page said "found at CNN.com".

               This value is backend-specific; in fact very few backends set this value.

       add_sources
               Same meaning as source above, for adding sources in case there are potentially multiple sources.

       sources Returns a reference to the list of sources.

       score   A  backend  specific,  numeric  score of the search result.  The exact range of scores is search-
               engine specific.  Usually larger scores  are  better,  but  this  is  no  longer  required.   See
               normalized_score for a backend independent score.

       normalized_score
               This is intended to be a backend-independent score of the search result.  The range of this score
               is between 0 and 1000.  Higher values indicate better quality results.

               This is not really implemented since no one has created an backend-independent ranking algorithm.

       change_date
               When the result was last changed.  Typically this is the modification time of the destination web
               page.

       index_date
               When the search engine indexed the result.

       size    The  approximate  size  of  the  result,  in bytes.  This is only an approximation because search
               backends often report the size as "18.4K"; the best we can do with that number is  return  it  as
               the value of 18.4 * 1024.

       raw     The raw HTML for the entire result.  Raw should be exactly the raw HTML for one entry.  It should
               not include list or table setup commands (like ul or table tags), but it may include list item or
               table  data  commands  (like  li,  tr, or td).  Whether raw contains a list entry, table row, br-
               separated lines, or plain text is search-engine dependent.  In fact, many backends  do  not  even
               return it at all.

       as_HTML Convert the search result to a human-readable form, decorated with HTML for pretty-printing.

   <b>Others</b>
       More  attributes  of  the  result.   Backend-specific.   Refer  to  the documentation of each backend for
       details.
