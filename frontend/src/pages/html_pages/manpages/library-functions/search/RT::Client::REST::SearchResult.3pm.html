</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       RT::Client::REST::SearchResult - search results object.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.72

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $iterator = $search-&gt;get_iterator;
         my $count = $iterator-&gt;count;

         while (defined(my $obj = &amp;$iterator)) {
           # do something with the $obj
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class is a representation of a search result.  This is the type of the object you get back when you
       call method "search()" on RT::Client::REST::Object-derived objects.  It makes it easy to iterate over
       results and find out just how many there are.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>count</b>
           Returns  the number of search results.  This number will always be the same unless you stick your fat
           dirty  fingers  into  the  object  and  abuse  it.   This  number  is  not  affected  by   calls   to
           "get_iterator()".

       <b>get_iterator</b>
           Returns a reference to a subroutine which is used to iterate over the results.

           Evaluating  it  in scalar context, returns the next object or "undef" if all the results have already
           been iterated over.  Note that for each object to be instantiated  with  correct  values,  <b>retrieve()</b>
           method is called on the object before returning it to the caller.

           Evaluating the subroutine reference in list context returns a list of all results fully instantiated.
           WARNING:  this may be expensive, as each object is issued <b>retrieve()</b> method.  Subsequent calls to the
           iterator result in empty list.

           You may safely mix calling the iterator in scalar and list context.  For example:

             $iterator = $search-&gt;get_iterator;

             $first = &amp;$iterator;
             $second = &amp;$iterator;
             @the_rest = &amp;$iterator;

           You can get as many iterators as you want -- they will not step on each other's toes.

       <b>new</b> You should not have to call it yourself, but  just  for  the  sake  of  completeness,  here  are  the
           arguments:

             my $search = RT::Client::REST::SearchResult-&gt;new(
               ids =&gt; [1 .. 10],
               object =&gt; sub {       # Yup, that's a closure.
                 RT::Client::REST::Ticket-&gt;new(
                   id =&gt; shift,
                   rt =&gt; $rt,
                 );
               },
             );
