       Plucene::Search::Filter - A search filter base class

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This doesn't seem to be being used just yet. But here is some info on filters:

       Filtering means imposing additional restriction on the hit list to eliminate hits that otherwise would be
       included in the search results.

       There are two ways to filter hits:

       •   Search  Query - in this approach, provide your custom filter object to the when you call the <b>search()</b>
           method. This filter will be called exactly once to evaluate every document that resulted in non  zero
           score.

       •   Selective  Collection - in this approach you perform the regular search and when you get back the hit
           list, collect only those that matches your filtering criteria.  In  this  approach,  your  filter  is
           called  only  for  hits that returned by the search method which may be only a subset of the non zero
           matches (useful when evaluating your search filter is expensive).
