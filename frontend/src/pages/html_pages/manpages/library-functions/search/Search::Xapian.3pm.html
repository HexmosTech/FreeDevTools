</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Search::Xapian - Perl XS frontend to the Xapian C++ search library.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Search::Xapian;

         my $db = Search::Xapian::Database-&gt;new( '[DATABASE DIR]' );
         my $enq = $db-&gt;enquire( '[QUERY TERM]' );

         printf "Running query '%s'\n", $enq-&gt;get_query()-&gt;get_description();

         my @matches = $enq-&gt;matches(0, 10);

         print scalar(@matches) . " results found\n";

         foreach my $match ( @matches ) {
           my $doc = $match-&gt;get_document();
           printf "ID %d %d%% [ %s ]\n", $match-&gt;get_docid(), $match-&gt;get_percent(), $doc-&gt;get_data();
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module wraps most methods of most Xapian classes. The missing classes and methods should be added in
       the future. It also provides a simplified, more 'perlish' interface to some common operations, as
       demonstrated above.

       There are some gaps in the POD documentation for wrapped classes, but you can read the Xapian C++ API
       documentation at &lt;https://xapian.org/docs/apidoc/html/annotated.html&gt; for details of these.
       Alternatively, take a look at the code in the examples and tests.

       If you want to use Search::Xapian and the threads module together, make sure you're using Search::Xapian
       &gt;= 1.0.4.0 and Perl &gt;= 5.8.7.  As of 1.0.4.0, Search::Xapian uses CLONE_SKIP to make sure that the perl
       wrapper objects aren't copied to new threads - without this the underlying C++ objects can get destroyed
       more than once.

       If you encounter problems, or have any comments, suggestions, patches, etc please email the Xapian-
       discuss mailing list (details of which can be found at &lt;https://xapian.org/lists&gt;).

   <b>EXPORT</b>
       None by default.

</pre><h4><b>:db</b></h4><pre>
       DB_OPEN
           Open a database, fail if database doesn't exist.

       DB_CREATE
           Create a new database, fail if database exists.

       DB_CREATE_OR_OPEN
           Open  an  existing database, without destroying data, or create a new database if one doesn't already
           exist.

       DB_CREATE_OR_OVERWRITE
           Overwrite database if it exists.

</pre><h4><b>:ops</b></h4><pre>
       OP_AND
           Match if both subqueries are satisfied.

       OP_OR
           Match if either subquery is satisfied.

       OP_AND_NOT
           Match if left but not right subquery is satisfied.

       OP_XOR
           Match if left or right, but not both queries are satisfied.

       OP_AND_MAYBE
           Match if left is satisfied, but use weights from both.

       OP_FILTER
           Like OP_AND, but only weight using the left query.

       OP_NEAR
           Match if the words are  near  each  other.  The  window  should  be  specified,  as  a  parameter  to
           "Search::Xapian::Query::Query", but it defaults to the number of terms in the list.

       OP_PHRASE
           Match as a phrase (All words in order).

       OP_ELITE_SET
           Select an elite set from the subqueries, and perform a query with these combined as an OR query.

       OP_VALUE_RANGE
           Filter by a range test on a document value.

</pre><h4><b>:qpflags</b></h4><pre>
       FLAG_DEFAULT
           This  gives  the  QueryParser  default flag settings, allowing you to easily add flags to the default
           ones.

       FLAG_BOOLEAN
           Support AND, OR, etc and bracketed subexpressions.

       FLAG_LOVEHATE
           Support + and -.

       FLAG_PHRASE
           Support quoted phrases.

       FLAG_BOOLEAN_ANY_CASE
           Support AND, OR, etc even if they aren't in ALLCAPS.

       FLAG_WILDCARD
           Support right truncation (e.g. Xap*).

       FLAG_PURE_NOT
           Allow queries such as 'NOT apples'.

           These require the use of a list of all documents in the database which is potentially  expensive,  so
           this feature isn't enabled by default.

       FLAG_PARTIAL
           Enable partial matching.

           Partial  matching  causes  the  parser to treat the query as a "partially entered" search.  This will
           automatically treat the final word as a wildcarded match, unless it is  followed  by  whitespace,  to
           produce more stable results from interactive searches.

       FLAG_SPELLING_CORRECTION
       FLAG_SYNONYM
       FLAG_AUTO_SYNONYMS
       FLAG_AUTO_MULTIWORD_SYNONYMS

</pre><h4><b>:qpstem</b></h4><pre>
       STEM_ALL
           Stem all terms.

       STEM_NONE
           Don't stem any terms.

       STEM_SOME
           Stem  some  terms,  in  a manner compatible with Omega (capitalised words and those in phrases aren't
           stemmed).

</pre><h4><b>:enq_order</b></h4><pre>
       ENQ_ASCENDING
           docids sort in ascending order (default)

       ENQ_DESCENDING
           docids sort in descending order

       ENQ_DONT_CARE
           docids sort in whatever order is most efficient for the backend

</pre><h4><b>:standard</b></h4><pre>
       Standard is db + ops + qpflags + qpstem

</pre><h4><b>Version</b> <b>functions</b></h4><pre>
       major_version
           Returns the major version of the Xapian C++ library being used.  E.g. for  Xapian  1.0.9  this  would
           return 1.

       minor_version
           Returns  the  minor  version  of the Xapian C++ library being used.  E.g. for Xapian 1.0.9 this would
           return 0.

       revision
           Returns the revision of the Xapian C++ library being used.  E.g. for Xapian 1.0.9 this  would  return
           9.   In  a stable release series, Xapian libraries with the same minor and major versions are usually
           ABI compatible, so this often won't match the third component of $Search::Xapian::VERSION  (which  is
           the version of the Search::Xapian XS wrappers).

</pre><h4><b>Numeric</b> <b>encoding</b> <b>functions</b></h4><pre>
       sortable_serialise NUMBER
           Convert a floating point number to a string, preserving sort order.

           This  method  converts a floating point number to a string, suitable for using as a value for numeric
           range restriction, or for use as a sort key.

           The conversion is platform independent.

           The conversion attempts to ensure that, for any pair of values supplied to the conversion  algorithm,
           the  result of comparing the original values (with a numeric comparison operator) will be the same as
           the result of comparing the resulting values (with a string comparison operator).  On platforms which
           represent doubles with the  precisions  specified  by  IEEE_754,  this  will  be  the  case:  if  the
           representation  of doubles is more precise, it is possible that two very close doubles will be mapped
           to the same string, so will compare equal.

           Note also that both zero and -zero will be converted to the same representation: since these  compare
           equal,  this  satisfies the comparison constraint, but it's worth knowing this if you wish to use the
           encoding in some situation where this distinction matters.

           Handling of NaN isn't (currently) guaranteed to be sensible.

       sortable_unserialise SERIALISED_NUMBER
           Convert a string encoded using sortable_serialise back to a floating point number.

           This expects the input to be a string produced by <b>sortable_serialise()</b>.  If the input is not  such  a
           string, the value returned is undefined (but no error will be thrown).

           The  result  of  the  conversion will be exactly the value which was supplied to <b>sortable_serialise()</b>
           when making the string on  platforms  which  represent  doubles  with  the  precisions  specified  by
           IEEE_754, but may be a different (nearby) value on other platforms.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       Error Handling
           Error handling for all methods liable to generate them.

       Documentation
           Add POD documentation for all classes, where possible just adapted from Xapian docs.

       Unwrapped classes
           The  following  Xapian  classes  are not yet wrapped: ErrorHandler, standard ExpandDecider subclasses
           (user-defined ones works), user-defined weight classes.

       Unwrapped methods
           The following methods are not yet wrapped: Enquire::get_eset(...) with more than two arguments, Query
           ctor optional "parameter" parameter, Remote::open(...), static <b>Stem::get_available_languages()</b>.

           We wrap <b>MSet::swap()</b> and MSet::operator[](),  but  not  <b>ESet::swap()</b>,  ESet::operator[]().   Is  swap
           actually useful?  Should we instead tie MSet and ESet to allow them to just be used as lists?
