</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Sphinx::Search;

           $sph = Sphinx::Search-&gt;new();

           # Standard API query
           $results = $sph-&gt;SetSortMode(SPH_SORT_RELEVANCE)
                          -&gt;Query("search terms");

           # SphinxQL query
           $results = $sph-&gt;SphinxQL("SELECT * FROM myindex WHERE MATCH('search terms')");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the Perl API client for the Sphinx open-source SQL full-text indexing search engine,
       &lt;<a href="http://www.sphinxsearch.com">http://www.sphinxsearch.com</a>&gt;.

       Since 0.9.9, Sphinx supports a native MySQL-protocol client, i.e. DBI with DBD::mysql. That is, you can
       configure the server to have a mysql41 listening port and then simply do

         my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:mysql:host=127.0.0.1;port=9306;mysql_enable_utf8=1') or die "Failed to connect via DBI";
         my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare_cached("SELECT * FROM myindex WHERE MATCH('search terms')");
         $sth-&gt;execute();
         while (my $row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref) {
             ... # Collect results
         }

       The DBI client turns out to be significantly (about 5x) faster than this pure-Perl API. You should
       probably be using that instead.

       This module also supports SphinxQL queries, with the small advantage that you can use either the standard
       API or the SphinxQL API over the one port (i.e. the searchd server does not need to be configured with a
       mysql41 listening port).

       Given that the DBI client has several advantages over this API, future updates of this module are
       unlikely.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           $sph = Sphinx::Search-&gt;new;
           $sph = Sphinx::Search-&gt;new(\%options);

       Create a new Sphinx::Search instance.

       OPTIONS

       log Specify  an  optional  logger  instance.   This can be any class that provides error, warn, info, and
           debug methods (e.g. see Log::Log4perl).  Logging is disabled if no logger instance is provided.

       debug
           Debug flag.  If set (and a logger instance is specified), debugging messages will be generated.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>GetLastError</b>
           $error = $sph-&gt;GetLastError;

       Get last error message (string)

   <b>GetLastWarning</b>
           $warning = $sph-&gt;GetLastWarning;

       Get last warning message (string)

   <b>IsConnectError</b>
       Check connection error flag (to differentiate between  network  connection  errors  and  bad  responses).
       Returns true value on connection error.

   <b>SetEncoders</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetEncoders(\&amp;encode_function, \&amp;decode_function)

       COMPATIBILITY  NOTE:  <b>SetEncoders()</b>  was  introduced  in  version  0.17.  Prior to that, all strings were
       considered to be sequences of bytes which may have led to issues with multi-byte characters.  If you were
       previously  encoding/decoding  strings  external  to   Sphinx::Search,   you   will   need   to   disable
       encoding/decoding by setting Sphinx::Search to use raw values as explained below (or modify your code and
       let Sphinx::Search do the recoding).

       Set  the  string encoder/decoder functions for transferring strings between perl and Sphinx.  The encoder
       should take the perl internal representation and convert to the bytestream that searchd expects, and  the
       decoder should take the bytestream returned by searchd and convert to perl format.

       The searchd format will depend on the 'charset_type' index setting in the Sphinx configuration file.

       The  coders  default  to  encode_utf8  and decode_utf8 respectively, which are compatible with the 'utf8'
       charset_type.

       If either the encoder or decoder functions are left undefined in the call to SetEncoders, they return  to
       their default values.

       If  you  wish  to  send  raw  values  (no  encoding/decoding),  supply a function that simply returns its
       argument, e.g.

           $sph-&gt;SetEncoders( sub { shift }, sub { shift });

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetServer</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetServer($host, $port);
           $sph-&gt;SetServer($path, $port);

       In the first form, sets the host (string) and port (integer) details  for  the  searchd  server  using  a
       network (INET) socket (default is localhost:9312).

       In  the  second form, where $path is a local filesystem path (optionally prefixed by 'unix://'), sets the
       client to access the searchd server via a local (UNIX domain) socket at the specified path.

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetConnectTimeout</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetConnectTimeout($timeout)

       Set server connection timeout (in seconds).

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetConnectRetries</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetConnectRetries($retries)

       Set server connection retries (in case of connection fail).

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetLimits</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetLimits($offset, $limit);
           $sph-&gt;SetLimits($offset, $limit, $max);

       Set match offset/limits, and optionally the max number of matches to return.

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetMaxQueryTime</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetMaxQueryTime($millisec);

       Set maximum query time, in milliseconds, per index.

       The value may not be negative; 0 means "do not limit".

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetMatchMode</b>
       ** DEPRECATED **

           $sph-&gt;SetMatchMode($mode);

       Set match mode, which may be one of:

       •   SPH_MATCH_ALL

           Match all words

       •   SPH_MATCH_ANY

           Match any words

       •   SPH_MATCH_PHRASE

           Exact phrase match

       •   SPH_MATCH_BOOLEAN

           Boolean match, using AND (&amp;), OR (|), NOT (!,-) and parenthetic grouping.

       •   SPH_MATCH_EXTENDED

           Extended match, which includes the Boolean syntax plus field, phrase and proximity operators.

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetRankingMode</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetRankingMode(SPH_RANK_BM25, $rank_exp);

       Set ranking mode, which may be one of:

       •   SPH_RANK_PROXIMITY_BM25

           Default mode, phrase proximity major factor and BM25 minor one

       •   SPH_RANK_BM25

           Statistical mode, BM25 ranking only (faster but worse quality)

       •   SPH_RANK_NONE

           No ranking, all matches get a weight of 1

       •   SPH_RANK_WORDCOUNT

           Simple word-count weighting, rank is a weighted sum of per-field keyword occurence counts

       •   SPH_RANK_MATCHANY

           Returns rank as it was computed in SPH_MATCH_ANY mode earlier, and  is  internally  used  to  emulate
           SPH_MATCH_ANY queries.

       •   SPH_RANK_FIELDMASK

           Returns  a  32-bit mask with N-th bit corresponding to N-th fulltext field, numbering from 0. The bit
           will only be set when the respective field has any keyword occurences satisfiying the query.

       •   SPH_RANK_SPH04

           SPH_RANK_SPH04 is generally based on the default  SPH_RANK_PROXIMITY_BM25  ranker,  but  additionally
           boosts the matches when they occur in the very beginning or the very end of a text field.

       •   SPH_RANK_EXPR

           Allows  the ranking formula to be specified at run time. It exposes a number of internal text factors
           and lets you define how the final weight should be computed from those factors.  $rank_exp should  be
           set   to   the   ranking   expression   string,   e.g.   to   emulate   SPH_RANK_PROXIMITY_BM25,  use
           "sum(lcs*user_weight)*1000+bm25".

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetSortMode</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetSortMode(SPH_SORT_RELEVANCE);
           $sph-&gt;SetSortMode($mode, $sortby);

       Set sort mode, which may be any of:

       SPH_SORT_RELEVANCE - sort by relevance
       SPH_SORT_ATTR_DESC, SPH_SORT_ATTR_ASC
           Sort by attribute descending/ascending.  $sortby specifies the sorting attribute.

       SPH_SORT_TIME_SEGMENTS
           Sort by time segments (last hour/day/week/month) in  descending  order,  and  then  by  relevance  in
           descending order.  $sortby specifies the time attribute.

       SPH_SORT_EXTENDED
           Sort by SQL-like syntax.  $sortby is the sorting specification.

       SPH_SORT_EXPR

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetWeights</b>
       ** DEPRECATED **

           $sph-&gt;SetWeights([ 1, 2, 3, 4]);

       This method is deprecated.  Use SetFieldWeights instead.

       Set  per-field  (integer)  weights.   The ordering of the weights correspond to the ordering of fields as
       indexed.

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetFieldWeights</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetFieldWeights(\%weights);

       Set per-field (integer) weights by field name.  The weights hash provides field name to weight mappings.

       Takes precedence over SetWeights.

       Unknown names will be silently ignored.  Missing fields will be given a weight of 1.

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetIndexWeights</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetIndexWeights(\%weights);

       Set per-index (integer) weights.  The weights hash is a mapping of index name to integer weight.

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetIDRange</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetIDRange($min, $max);

       Set IDs range only match those records where document ID is between $min and  $max  (including  $min  and
       $max)

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetFilter</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetFilter($attr, \@values);
           $sph-&gt;SetFilter($attr, \@values, $exclude);

       Sets  the results to be filtered on the given attribute.  Only results which have attributes matching the
       given values will be returned.  (Attribute values must be integers).

       This may be called multiple times with different attributes to select on multiple attributes.

       If 'exclude' is set, excludes results that match the filter.

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetFilterString</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetFilterString($attr, $value)
           $sph-&gt;SetFilterString($attr, $value, $exclude)

       Adds new string value filter.  Only those documents where $attr column value  matches  the  string  value
       from $value will be matched (or rejected, if $exclude is true).

   <b>SetFilterRange</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetFilterRange($attr, $min, $max);
           $sph-&gt;SetFilterRange($attr, $min, $max, $exclude);

       Sets  the  results  to be filtered on a range of values for the given attribute. Only those records where
       $attr column value is between $min and $max (including $min and $max) will be returned.

       If 'exclude' is set, excludes results that fall within the given range.

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetFilterFloatRange</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetFilterFloatRange($attr, $min, $max, $exclude);

       Same as SetFilterRange, but allows floating point values.

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetGeoAnchor</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetGeoAnchor($attrlat, $attrlong, $lat, $long);

       Setup anchor point for using geosphere distance calculations in filters and sorting.   Distance  will  be
       computed with respect to this point

       $attrlat is the name of latitude attribute
       $attrlong is the name of longitude attribute
       $lat is anchor point latitude, in radians
       $long is anchor point longitude, in radians

       Returns $sph.

   <b>SetGroupBy</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetGroupBy($attr, $func);
           $sph-&gt;SetGroupBy($attr, $func, $groupsort);

       Sets attribute and function of results grouping.

       In  grouping  mode,  all  matches are assigned to different groups based on grouping function value. Each
       group keeps track of the total match count, and the best match  (in  this  group)  according  to  current
       sorting  function.  The  final result set contains one best match per group, with grouping function value
       and matches count attached.

       $attr is any valid attribute.  Use ResetGroupBy to disable grouping.

       $func is one of:

       •   SPH_GROUPBY_DAY

           Group by day (assumes timestamp type attribute of form YYYYMMDD)

       •   SPH_GROUPBY_WEEK

           Group by week (assumes timestamp type attribute of form YYYYNNN)

       •   SPH_GROUPBY_MONTH

           Group by month (assumes timestamp type attribute of form YYYYMM)

       •   SPH_GROUPBY_YEAR

           Group by year (assumes timestamp type attribute of form YYYY)

       •   SPH_GROUPBY_ATTR

           Group by attribute value

       •   SPH_GROUPBY_ATTRPAIR

           Group by two attributes, being the given attribute and the attribute that immediately follows  it  in
           the  sequence  of  indexed  attributes.  The specified attribute may therefore not be the last of the
           indexed attributes.

       Groups in the set of results can be sorted by  any  SQL-like  sorting  clause,  including  both  document
       attributes and the following special internal Sphinx attributes:

       @id - document ID;
       @weight, @rank, @relevance -  match weight;
       @group - group by function value;
       @count - number of matches in group.

       The default mode is to sort by groupby value in descending order, ie. by "@group desc".

       In the results set, "total_found" contains the total amount of matching groups over the whole index.

       WARNING:  grouping  is  done in fixed memory and thus its results are only approximate; so there might be
       more groups reported in total_found than actually present. @count might also be underestimated.

       For example, if sorting by relevance  and  grouping  by  a  "published"  attribute  with  SPH_GROUPBY_DAY
       function,  then the result set will contain only the most relevant match for each day when there were any
       matches published, with day number and per-day  match  count  attached,  and  sorted  by  day  number  in
       descending order (ie. recent days first).

   <b>SetGroupDistinct</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetGroupDistinct($attr);

       Set count-distinct attribute for group-by queries

   <b>SetRetries</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetRetries($count, $delay);

       Set distributed retries count and delay

   <b>SetOverride</b>
        ** DEPRECATED **

           $sph-&gt;SetOverride($attrname, $attrtype, $values);

        Set attribute values override. There can be only one override per attribute.
        $values must be a hash that maps document IDs to attribute values

   <b>SetSelect</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetSelect($select)

       Set select list (attributes or expressions).  SQL-like syntax.

   <b>SetQueryFlag</b>
           $sph-&gt;SetQueryFlag($flag_name, $flag_value);

   <b>SetOuterSelect</b>
         $sph-&gt;SetOuterSelect($orderby, $offset, $limit)

   <b>ResetFilters</b>
           $sph-&gt;ResetFilters;

       Clear all filters.

   <b>ResetGroupBy</b>
           $sph-&gt;ResetGroupBy;

       Clear all group-by settings (for multi-queries)

   <b>ResetOverrides</b>
       Clear all attribute value overrides (for multi-queries)

   <b>ResetQueryFlag</b>
       Clear all query flags.

   <b>ResetOuterSelect</b>
       Clear all outer select settings.

   <b>Query</b>
           $results = $sph-&gt;Query($query, $index);

       Connect to searchd server and run given search query.

       query is query string
       index is index name to query, default is "*" which means to query all indexes.  Use a space or comma
       separated list to search multiple indexes.

       Returns undef on failure

       Returns hash which has the following keys on success:

       matches
           Array containing hashes with found documents ( "doc", "weight", "group", "stamp" )

       total
           Total amount of matches retrieved (upto SPH_MAX_MATCHES, see sphinx.h)

       total_found
           Total amount of matching documents in index

       time
           Search time

       words
           Hash which maps query terms (stemmed!) to ( "docs", "hits" ) hash

       Returns the results array on success, undef on error.

   <b>AddQuery</b>
          $sph-&gt;AddQuery($query, $index);

       Add a query to a batch request.

       Batch  queries  enable  searchd  to  perform  internal  optimizations,  if  possible;  and reduce network
       connection overheads in all cases.

       For instance, running exactly the same query with different groupby  settings  will  enable  searched  to
       perform  expensive full-text search and ranking operation only once, but compute multiple groupby results
       from its output.

       Parameters are exactly the same as in <b>Query()</b> call.

       Returns corresponding index to the results array returned by <b>RunQueries()</b> call.

   <b>RunQueries</b>
           $sph-&gt;RunQueries

       Run batch of queries, as added by AddQuery.

       Returns undef on network IO failure.

       Returns an array of result sets on success.

       Each result set in the returned array is a hash which contains the same keys  as  the  hash  returned  by
       Query, plus:

       •   error

           Errors, if any, for this query.

       •   warning

           Any warnings associated with the query.

   <b>SphinxQL</b>
         my $results = $sph-&gt;SphinxQL($sphinxql_query);

       This  is  an  alternative  implementation  of  the  SphinxQL  API  to  the DBI option. Frankly, it was an
       experiment, and the DBI driver proved to have much better performance. Whilst this may be useful to some,
       in general if you are considering using this method then you should probably look at connecting  directly
       via DBI instead.

       Results are return in a hash containing an array of 'columns' and 'rows' and possibly a warning count. If
       a  server-side  error  occurs,  the hash contains the 'error' field. If a communication error occurs, the
       return value will be undefined. In either error case, GetLastError will return the error.

   <b>BuildExcerpts</b>
           $excerpts = $sph-&gt;BuildExcerpts($docs, $index, $words, $opts)

       Generate document excerpts for the specified documents.

       docs
           An array reference of strings which represent the document contents

       index
           A string specifiying the index whose settings will be used for stemming, lexing and case folding

       words
           A string which contains the words to highlight

       opts
           A hash which contains additional optional highlighting parameters:

           before_match - a string to insert before a set of matching words, default is "&lt;b&gt;"
           after_match - a string to insert after a set of matching words, default is "&lt;b&gt;"
           chunk_separator - a string to insert between excerpts chunks, default is " ... "
           limit - max excerpt size in symbols (codepoints), default is 256
           limit_passages - Limits the maximum number of passages that can be included into the snippet.
           Integer, default is 0 (no limit).
           limit_words - Limits the maximum number of keywords that can be included into the snippet. Integer,
           default is 0 (no limit).
           around - how many words to highlight around each match, default is 5
           exact_phrase - whether to highlight exact phrase matches only, default is false
           single_passage - whether to extract single best passage only, default is false
           use_boundaries
           weight_order - Whether to sort the extracted passages in order of relevance (decreasing weight), or
           in order of appearance in the document (increasing position). Boolean, default is false.
           query_mode - Whether to handle $words as a query in extended syntax, or as a bag of words (default
           behavior). For instance, in query mode ("one two" | "three four") will only highlight and include
           those occurrences "one two" or "three four" when the two words from each pair are adjacent to each
           other. In default mode, any single occurrence of "one", "two", "three", or "four" would be
           highlighted. Boolean, default is false.
           force_all_words - Ignores the snippet length limit until it includes all the keywords. Boolean,
           default is false.
           start_passage_id - Specifies the starting value of %PASSAGE_ID% macro (that gets detected and
           expanded in before_match, after_match strings). Integer, default is 1.
           load_files - Whether to handle $docs as data to extract snippets from (default behavior), or to treat
           it as file names, and load data from specified files on the server side. Boolean, default is false.
           html_strip_mode - HTML stripping mode setting. Defaults to "index", which means that index settings
           will be used. The other values are "none" and "strip", that forcibly skip or apply stripping
           irregardless of index settings; and "retain", that retains HTML markup and protects it from
           highlighting. The "retain" mode can only be used when highlighting full documents and thus requires
           that no snippet size limits are set. String, allowed values are "none", "strip", "index", and
           "retain".
           allow_empty - Allows empty string to be returned as highlighting result when a snippet could not be
           generated (no keywords match, or no passages fit the limit). By default, the beginning of original
           text would be returned instead of an empty string. Boolean, default is false.
           passage_boundary
           emit_zones
           load_files_scattered

       Returns undef on failure.

   <b>BuildKeywords</b>
           $results = $sph-&gt;BuildKeywords($query, $index, $hits)

       Generate keyword list for a given query Returns undef on failure, Returns an array of hashes, where  each
       hash describes a word in the query with the following keys:

       •   tokenized

           Tokenised term from query

       •   normalized

           Normalised term from query

       •   docs

           Number of docs in which word was found (if $hits is true)

       •   hits

           Number of occurrences of word (if $hits is true)

   <b>EscapeString</b>
           $escaped = $sph-&gt;EscapeString('abcde!@#$%')

       Inserts backslash before all non-word characters in the given string.

   <b>UpdateAttributes</b>
           $sph-&gt;UpdateAttributes($index, \@attrs, \%values);
           $sph-&gt;UpdateAttributes($index, \@attrs, \%values, $mva);
           $sph-&gt;UpdateAttributes($index, \@attrs, \%values, $mva, $ignorenonexistent);

       Update specified attributes on specified documents

       index
           Name of the index to be updated

       attrs
           Array of attribute name strings

       values
           A hash with key as document id, value as an array of new attribute values

       mva If set, indicates that there is update of MVA attributes

       ignorenonexistent
           If  set,  the  update  will silently ignore any warnings about trying to update a column which is not
           exists in current index schema.

       Returns number of actually updated documents (0 or more) on success

       Returns undef on failure

       Usage example:

        $sph-&gt;UpdateAttributes("test1", [ qw/group_id/ ], { 1 =&gt; [ 456] }) );

   <b>Open</b>
           $sph-&gt;Open()

       Opens a persistent connection for subsequent queries.

       To reduce the network connection overhead of making Sphinx queries, you can call $sph-&gt;<b>Open()</b>,  then  run
       any number of queries, and call $sph-&gt;<b>Close()</b> when finished.

       Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

   <b>Close</b>
           $sph-&gt;Close()

       Closes a persistent connection.

       Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

   <b>Status</b>
           $status = $sph-&gt;Status()
           $status = $sph-&gt;Status($session)

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       There  is  (or  was) a bundled Sphinx.pm in the contrib area of the Sphinx source distribution, which was
       used as the starting point of Sphinx::Search.  Maintenance of that version  appears  to  have  lapsed  at
       sphinx-0.9.7,  so  many  of  the  newer  API  calls  are  not  available there.  Sphinx::Search is mostly
       compatible with the old Sphinx.pm except:

       On failure, Sphinx::Search returns undef rather than 0 or -1.
       Sphinx::Search 'Set' functions are cascadable, e.g. you can do Sphinx::Search-&gt;new
       -&gt;SetMatchMode(SPH_MATCH_ALL) -&gt;SetSortMode(SPH_SORT_RELEVANCE) -&gt;Query("search terms")

       Sphinx::Search also provides documentation and unit tests, which were the main motivations for  branching
       from the earlier work.

       This module is based on Sphinx.pm (not deployed to CPAN) for Sphinx version 0.9.7-rc1, by Len Kranendonk,
       which was in turn based on the Sphinx PHP API.

       Thanks to Alexey Kholodkov for contributing a significant patch for handling persistent connections.
