       PDGETRI - compute the inverse of a distributed matrix using the LU factorization computed by PDGETRF

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       SUBROUTINE PDGETRI( N, A, IA, JA, DESCA, IPIV, WORK, LWORK, IWORK, LIWORK, INFO )

           INTEGER         IA, INFO, JA, LIWORK, LWORK, N

           INTEGER         DESCA( * ), IPIV( * ), IWORK( * )

           DOUBLE          PRECISION A( * ), WORK( * )

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       PDGETRI computes the inverse of a distributed matrix using the LU factorization computed by PDGETRF. This
       method  inverts  U  and  then  computes  the inverse of sub( A ) = A(IA:IA+N-1,JA:JA+N-1) denoted InvA by
       solving the system InvA*L = inv(U) for InvA.

       Notes
       =====

       Each global data object is described by  an  associated  description  vector.   This  vector  stores  the
       information required to establish the mapping between an object element and its corresponding process and
       memory location.

       Let  A  be  a  generic  term  for  any  2D  block cyclicly distributed array.  Such a global array has an
       associated description vector DESCA.  In the following comments, the character _ should be  read  as  "of
       the global array".

       NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
       ---------------  -------------- -------------------------------------- DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_ )The
       descriptor type.  In this case,
                                      DTYPE_A = 1.
       CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
                                      the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
                                      ted over. The context itself is glo-
                                      bal, but the handle (the integer
                                      value) may vary.
       M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
                                      array A.
       N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
                                      array A.
       MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the rows of the array.
       NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the columns of the array.
       RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
                                      row of the array A is distributed.  CSRC_A (global)  DESCA(  CSRC_  )  The
       process column over which the
                                      first column of the array A is
                                      distributed.
       LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
                                      array.  LLD_A &gt;= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).

       Let  K  be  the  number  of rows or columns of a distributed matrix, and assume that its process grid has
       dimension p x q.
       LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the
       p processes of its process column.
       Similarly, LOCc( K ) denotes the number of elements  of  K  that  a  process  would  receive  if  K  were
       distributed over the q processes of its process row.
       The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
               LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
               LOCc(  N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).  An upper bound for these quantities may be
       computed by:
               LOCr( M ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
               LOCc( N ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       N       (global input) INTEGER
               The number of rows and columns to be operated on, i.e. the order  of  the  distributed  submatrix
               sub( A ). N &gt;= 0.

       A       (local input/local output) DOUBLE PRECISION pointer into the
               local  memory to an array of dimension (LLD_A,LOCc(JA+N-1)).  On entry, the local pieces of the L
               and U obtained by the factorization sub( A ) = P*L*U computed by PDGETRF. On exit, if INFO  =  0,
               sub( A ) contains the inverse of the original distributed matrix sub( A ).

       IA      (global input) INTEGER
               The row index in the global array A indicating the first row of sub( A ).

       JA      (global input) INTEGER
               The column index in the global array A indicating the first column of sub( A ).

       DESCA   (global and local input) INTEGER array of dimension DLEN_.
               The array descriptor for the distributed matrix A.

       IPIV    (local input) INTEGER array, dimension LOCr(M_A)+MB_A
               keeps  track  of  the  pivoting  information. IPIV(i) is the global row index the local row i was
               swapped with.  This array is tied to the distributed matrix A.

       WORK    (local workspace/local output) DOUBLE PRECISION array,
               dimension (LWORK) On exit, <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1) returns the minimal and optimal LWORK.

       LWORK   (local or global input) INTEGER
               The dimension of  the  array  WORK.   LWORK  is  local  input  and  must  be  at  least  LWORK  =
               LOCr(N+MOD(IA-1,MB_A))*NB_A.  WORK  is  used  to keep a copy of at most an entire column block of
               sub( A ).

               If LWORK = -1, then LWORK is global input and a workspace query  is  assumed;  the  routine  only
               calculates  the minimum and optimal size for all work arrays. Each of these values is returned in
               the first entry of the corresponding work array, and no error message is issued by PXERBLA.

       IWORK   (local workspace/local output) INTEGER array,
               dimension (LIWORK) On exit, <a href="../man1/IWORK.1.html">IWORK</a>(1) returns the minimal and optimal LIWORK.

       LIWORK  (local or global input) INTEGER
               The dimension of the array IWORK used as workspace for physically transposing the pivots.  LIWORK
               is local input and must be at least if NPROW == NPCOL then LIWORK = LOCc( N_A + MOD(JA-1, NB_A) )
               +    NB_A,    else    LIWORK    =     LOCc(    N_A    +    MOD(JA-1,    NB_A)    )     +     MAX(
               CEIL(CEIL(LOCr(M_A)/MB_A)/(LCM/NPROW)),  NB_A ) where LCM is the least common multiple of process
               rows and columns (NPROW and NPCOL).  end if

               If LIWORK = -1, then LIWORK is global input and a workspace query is assumed;  the  routine  only
               calculates  the minimum and optimal size for all work arrays. Each of these values is returned in
               the first entry of the corresponding work array, and no error message is issued by PXERBLA.

       INFO    (global output) INTEGER
               = 0:  successful exit
               &lt; 0:  If the i-th argument is an array and  the  j-entry  had  an  illegal  value,  then  INFO  =
               -(i*100+j),  if the i-th argument is a scalar and had an illegal value, then INFO = -i.  &gt; 0:  If
               INFO = K, U(IA+K-1,IA+K-1) is exactly zero; the matrix is singular and its inverse could  not  be
               computed.
