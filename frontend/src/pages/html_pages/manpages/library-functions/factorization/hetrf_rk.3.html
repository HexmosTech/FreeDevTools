       <b>CHETRF_RK</b> computes the factorization of a complex Hermitian indefinite matrix using the bounded Bunch-
       Kaufman (rook) diagonal pivoting method (BLAS3 blocked algorithm).

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CHETRF_RK computes the factorization of a complex Hermitian matrix A
            using the bounded Bunch-Kaufman (rook) diagonal pivoting method:

               A = P*U*D*(U**H)*(P**T) or A = P*L*D*(L**H)*(P**T),

            where U (or L) is unit upper (or lower) triangular matrix,
            U**H (or L**H) is the conjugate of U (or L), P is a permutation
            matrix, P**T is the transpose of P, and D is Hermitian and block
            diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

            This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.
            For more information see Further Details section.

                     On exit, contains:
                       a) ONLY diagonal elements of the Hermitian block diagonal
                          matrix D on the diagonal of A, i.e. D(k,k) = A(k,k);
                          (superdiagonal (or subdiagonal) elements of D
                           are stored on exit in array E), and
                       b) If UPLO = 'U': factor U in the superdiagonal part of A.

                     NOTE: For 1-by-1 diagonal block D(k), where
                     1 &lt;= k &lt;= N, the element E(k) is set to 0 in both
                     UPLO = 'U' or UPLO = 'L' cases.

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     represents the index of row and column that were
                     interchanged with the k-th row and column. The value of UPLO
                     describes the order in which the interchanges were applied.
                     Also, the sign of IPIV represents the block structure of
                     the Hermitian block diagonal matrix D with 1-by-1 or 2-by-2
                     diagonal blocks which correspond to 1 or 2 interchanges
                     at each factorization step. For more info see Further
                     Details section.

                             If -IPIV(k) = k, no interchange occurred.
                          2) If -IPIV(k-1) != k-1, rows and columns

                             If -IPIV(k-1) = k-1, no interchange occurred.

                       d) NOTE: Any entry IPIV(k) is always NONZERO on output.

           <u>WORK</u>

                     WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)).
                     On exit, if INFO = 0, <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

           <u>LWORK</u>

                     LWORK is INTEGER
                     The length of WORK.  LWORK &gt;= 1.  For best performance
                     LWORK &gt;= N*NB, where NB is the block size returned
                     by ILAENV.

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed;
                     the routine only calculates the optimal size of the WORK
                     array, returns this value as the first entry of the WORK
                     array, and no error message related to LWORK is issued
                     by XERBLA.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0: successful exit

                     &lt; 0: If INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value

                     &gt; 0: If INFO = k, the matrix A is singular, because:
                            If UPLO = 'U': column k in the upper
                            triangular part of A contains all zeros.
                            If UPLO = 'L': column k in the lower
                            triangular part of A contains all zeros.

                          Therefore D(k,k) is exactly zero, and superdiagonal
                          elements of column k of U (or subdiagonal elements of
                          column k of L ) are all zeros. The factorization has
                          been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
                          exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if
                          it is used to solve a system of equations.

                          NOTE: INFO only stores the first occurrence of
                          a singularity, any subsequent occurrence of singularity
                          is not stored in INFO even though the factorization
                          always completes.

       <b>CSYTRF_RK</b> computes the factorization of a complex symmetric indefinite matrix using the bounded Bunch-
       Kaufman (rook) diagonal pivoting method (BLAS3 blocked algorithm).

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CSYTRF_RK computes the factorization of a complex symmetric matrix A
            using the bounded Bunch-Kaufman (rook) diagonal pivoting method:

               A = P*U*D*(U**T)*(P**T) or A = P*L*D*(L**T)*(P**T),

            where U (or L) is unit upper (or lower) triangular matrix,
            U**T (or L**T) is the transpose of U (or L), P is a permutation
            matrix, P**T is the transpose of P, and D is symmetric and block
            diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

            This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.

       <b>DSYTRF_RK</b> computes the factorization of a real symmetric indefinite matrix using the bounded Bunch-
       Kaufman (rook) diagonal pivoting method (BLAS3 blocked algorithm).

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DSYTRF_RK computes the factorization of a real symmetric matrix A
            using the bounded Bunch-Kaufman (rook) diagonal pivoting method:

               A = P*U*D*(U**T)*(P**T) or A = P*L*D*(L**T)*(P**T),

            where U (or L) is unit upper (or lower) triangular matrix,
            U**T (or L**T) is the transpose of U (or L), P is a permutation
            matrix, P**T is the transpose of P, and D is symmetric and block
            diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

            This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.

                     The length of WORK.  LWORK &gt;= 1.  For best performance
                     LWORK &gt;= N*NB, where NB is the block size returned
                     by ILAENV.

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed;
                     the routine only calculates the optimal size of the WORK
                     array, returns this value as the first entry of the WORK
                     array, and no error message related to LWORK is issued
                     by XERBLA.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0: successful exit

                     &lt; 0: If INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value

                     &gt; 0: If INFO = k, the matrix A is singular, because:
                            If UPLO = 'U': column k in the upper
                            triangular part of A contains all zeros.
                            If UPLO = 'L': column k in the lower
                            triangular part of A contains all zeros.

                          Therefore D(k,k) is exactly zero, and superdiagonal
                          elements of column k of U (or subdiagonal elements of
                          column k of L ) are all zeros. The factorization has
                          been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
                          exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if
                          it is used to solve a system of equations.

                          NOTE: INFO only stores the first occurrence of
                          a singularity, any subsequent occurrence of singularity
                          is not stored in INFO even though the factorization
                          always completes.

                          it is used to solve a system of equations.

                          NOTE: INFO only stores the first occurrence of

       <b>ZSYTRF_RK</b> computes the factorization of a complex symmetric indefinite matrix using the bounded Bunch-
       Kaufman (rook) diagonal pivoting method (BLAS3 blocked algorithm).

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            ZSYTRF_RK computes the factorization of a complex symmetric matrix A
            using the bounded Bunch-Kaufman (rook) diagonal pivoting method:

               A = P*U*D*(U**T)*(P**T) or A = P*L*D*(L**T)*(P**T),

            where U (or L) is unit upper (or lower) triangular matrix,
            U**T (or L**T) is the transpose of U (or L), P is a permutation
            matrix, P**T is the transpose of P, and D is symmetric and block
            diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

            This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.

                             If -IPIV(k+1) = k+1, no interchange occurred.

                       c) In both cases a) and b), always ABS( IPIV(k) ) &gt;= k.

                       d) NOTE: Any entry IPIV(k) is always NONZERO on output.

           <u>WORK</u>

                     WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension ( MAX(1,LWORK) ).
                     On exit, if INFO = 0, <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

           <u>LWORK</u>

                     LWORK is INTEGER
                     The length of WORK.  LWORK &gt;=1.  For best performance
                     LWORK &gt;= N*NB, where NB is the block size returned
                     by ILAENV.

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed;
                     the routine only calculates the optimal size of the WORK
                     array, returns this value as the first entry of the WORK
                     array, and no error message related to LWORK is issued
                     by XERBLA.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0: successful exit

                     &lt; 0: If INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value

                     &gt; 0: If INFO = k, the matrix A is singular, because:
                            If UPLO = 'U': column k in the upper
                            triangular part of A contains all zeros.
                            If UPLO = 'L': column k in the lower
                            triangular part of A contains all zeros.

                          Therefore D(k,k) is exactly zero, and superdiagonal
                          elements of column k of U (or subdiagonal elements of
                          column k of L ) are all zeros. The factorization has
                          been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
                          exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if
                          it is used to solve a system of equations.

                          NOTE: INFO only stores the first occurrence of
                          a singularity, any subsequent occurrence of singularity
                          is not stored in INFO even though the factorization
                          always completes.
