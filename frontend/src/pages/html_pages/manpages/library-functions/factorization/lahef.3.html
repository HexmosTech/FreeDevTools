       <b>CLAHEF</b> computes a partial factorization of a complex Hermitian indefinite matrix using the Bunch-Kaufman
       diagonal pivoting method (blocked algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS).

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CLAHEF computes a partial factorization of a complex Hermitian
            matrix A using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method. The
            partial factorization has the form:

            A  =  ( I  U12 ) ( A11  0  ) (  I      0     )  if UPLO = 'U', or:
                  ( 0  U22 ) (  0   D  ) ( U12**H U22**H )

            A  =  ( L11  0 ) (  D   0  ) ( L11**H L21**H )  if UPLO = 'L'
                  ( L21  I ) (  0  A22 ) (  0      I     )

            where the order of D is at most NB. The actual order is returned in
            the argument KB, and is either NB or NB-1, or N if N &lt;= NB.
            Note that U**H denotes the conjugate transpose of U.

            CLAHEF is an auxiliary routine called by CHETRF. It uses blocked code
            (calling Level 3 BLAS) to update the submatrix A11 (if UPLO = 'U') or
            A22 (if UPLO = 'L').

       <b>Parameters</b>

                        k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
                        is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

                     If UPLO = 'L':
                        Only the first KB elements of IPIV are set.

                        If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were

                        If IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns
                        k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1)
                        is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

       <b>SLASYF</b> computes a partial factorization of a real symmetric matrix using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal
       pivoting method.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SLASYF computes a partial factorization of a real symmetric matrix A
            using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method. The partial
            factorization has the form:

            A  =  ( I  U12 ) ( A11  0  ) (  I       0    )  if UPLO = 'U', or:
                  ( 0  U22 ) (  0   D  ) ( U12**T U22**T )

            A  =  ( L11  0 ) (  D   0  ) ( L11**T L21**T )  if UPLO = 'L'
                  ( L21  I ) (  0  A22 ) (  0       I    )

            where the order of D is at most NB. The actual order is returned in
            the argument KB, and is either NB or NB-1, or N if N &lt;= NB.

            SLASYF is an auxiliary routine called by SSYTRF. It uses blocked code
            (calling Level 3 BLAS) to update the submatrix A11 (if UPLO = 'U') or
            A22 (if UPLO = 'L').

                     triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
                     leading n-by-n lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.
                     On exit, A contains details of the partial factorization.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                     Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.

                     If UPLO = 'U':
                        Only the last KB elements of IPIV are set.

                        If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
                        interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

                        If IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns
                        k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
                        is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

                     If UPLO = 'L':
                        Only the first KB elements of IPIV are set.

                        If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
                        interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

                        If IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns
                        k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1)
                        is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

           <u>W</u>

                     W is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDW,NB)

           <u>LDW</u>

                     LDW is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array W.  LDW &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0: successful exit
                     &gt; 0: if INFO = k, D(k,k) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                          has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
                          exactly singular.
