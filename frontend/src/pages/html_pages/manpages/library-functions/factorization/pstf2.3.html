       <b>CPSTF2</b> computes the Cholesky factorization with complete pivoting of complex Hermitian positive
       semidefinite matrix.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CPSTF2 computes the Cholesky factorization with complete
            pivoting of a complex Hermitian positive semidefinite matrix A.

            The factorization has the form
               P**T * A * P = U**H * U ,  if UPLO = 'U',
               P**T * A * P = L  * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
            where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular, and
            P is stored as vector PIV.

            This algorithm does not attempt to check that A is positive
            semidefinite. This version of the algorithm calls level 2 BLAS.
