       PCPOTRF - compute the Cholesky factorization of an N-by-N complex hermitian positive definite distributed
       matrix sub( A ) denoting A(IA:IA+N-1, JA:JA+N-1)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       SUBROUTINE PCPOTRF( UPLO, N, A, IA, JA, DESCA, INFO )

           CHARACTER       UPLO

           INTEGER         IA, INFO, JA, N

           INTEGER         DESCA( * )

           COMPLEX         A( * )

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       PCPOTRF  computes the Cholesky factorization of an N-by-N complex hermitian positive definite distributed
       matrix sub( A ) denoting A(IA:IA+N-1, JA:JA+N-1).

       The factorization has the form

                 sub( A ) = U' * U ,  if UPLO = 'U', or

                 sub( A ) = L  * L',  if UPLO = 'L',

       where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.

       Notes
       =====

       Each global data object is described by  an  associated  description  vector.   This  vector  stores  the
       information required to establish the mapping between an object element and its corresponding process and
       memory location.

       Let  A  be  a  generic  term  for  any  2D  block cyclicly distributed array.  Such a global array has an
       associated description vector DESCA.  In the following comments, the character _ should be  read  as  "of
       the global array".

       NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
       ---------------  -------------- -------------------------------------- DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_ )The
       descriptor type.  In this case,
                                      DTYPE_A = 1.
       CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
                                      the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
                                      ted over. The context itself is glo-
                                      bal, but the handle (the integer
                                      value) may vary.
       M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
                                      array A.
       N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
                                      array A.
       MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the rows of the array.
       NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the columns of the array.
       RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
                                      row of the array A is distributed.  CSRC_A (global)  DESCA(  CSRC_  )  The
       process column over which the
                                      first column of the array A is
                                      distributed.
       LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
                                      array.  LLD_A &gt;= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).

       Let  K  be  the  number  of rows or columns of a distributed matrix, and assume that its process grid has
       dimension p x q.
       LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the
       p processes of its process column.
       Similarly, LOCc( K ) denotes the number of elements  of  K  that  a  process  would  receive  if  K  were
       distributed over the q processes of its process row.
       The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
               LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
               LOCc(  N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).  An upper bound for these quantities may be
       computed by:
               LOCr( M ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
               LOCc( N ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A

       This routine requires square block decomposition ( MB_A = NB_A ).

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       UPLO    (global input) CHARACTER
               = 'U':  Upper triangle of sub( A ) is stored;
               = 'L':  Lower triangle of sub( A ) is stored.

       N       (global input) INTEGER
               The number of rows and columns to be operated on, i.e. the order  of  the  distributed  submatrix
               sub( A ). N &gt;= 0.

       A       (local input/local output) COMPLEX pointer into the
               local  memory  to an array of dimension (LLD_A, LOCc(JA+N-1)).  On entry, this array contains the
               local pieces of the N-by-N Hermitian distributed matrix sub( A ) to be factored.  If UPLO =  'U',
               the  leading  N-by-N  upper triangular part of sub( A ) contains the upper triangular part of the
               matrix, and its strictly lower triangular part is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading  N-
               by-N  lower  triangular  part of sub( A ) contains the lower triangular part of the distribu- ted
               matrix, and its strictly upper triangular part is not referenced. On exit, if  UPLO  =  'U',  the
               upper  triangular  part  of the distributed matrix contains the Cholesky factor U, if UPLO = 'L',
               the lower triangular part of the distribu- ted matrix contains the Cholesky factor L.

       IA      (global input) INTEGER
               The row index in the global array A indicating the first row of sub( A ).

       JA      (global input) INTEGER
               The column index in the global array A indicating the first column of sub( A ).

       DESCA   (global and local input) INTEGER array of dimension DLEN_.
               The array descriptor for the distributed matrix A.

       INFO    (global output) INTEGER
               = 0:  successful exit
               &lt; 0:  If the i-th argument is an array and  the  j-entry  had  an  illegal  value,  then  INFO  =
               -(i*100+j),  if the i-th argument is a scalar and had an illegal value, then INFO = -i.  &gt; 0:  If
               INFO = K, the leading minor of order K,
               A(IA:IA+K-1,JA:JA+K-1) is not positive definite, and the factorization could not be completed.
