       <b>CHETF2</b> computes the factorization of a complex Hermitian matrix, using the diagonal pivoting method
       (unblocked algorithm calling Level 2 BLAS).

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CHETF2 computes the factorization of a complex Hermitian matrix A
            using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method:

               A = U*D*U**H  or  A = L*D*L**H

            where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
            triangular matrices, U**H is the conjugate transpose of U, and D is
            Hermitian and block diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

            This is the unblocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 2 BLAS.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                     Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the
                     Hermitian matrix A is stored:
                     = 'U':  Upper triangular
                     = 'L':  Lower triangular

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                     The order of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
                     n-by-n upper triangular part of A contains the upper
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
                     leading n-by-n lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.

                     On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
                     to obtain the factor U or L (see below for further details).

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                     Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.

                     If UPLO = 'U':
                        If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
                        interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

                        If IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns
                        k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
                        is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

                     If UPLO = 'L':
                        If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
                        interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

                        If IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns
                        k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1)
                        is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0: successful exit
                     &lt; 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
                     &gt; 0: if INFO = k, D(k,k) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                          has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
                          exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it
                          is used to solve a system of equations.

       <b>ZSYTF2</b> computes the factorization of a real symmetric indefinite matrix, using the diagonal pivoting
       method (unblocked algorithm).

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            ZSYTF2 computes the factorization of a complex symmetric matrix A
            using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method:

               A = U*D*U**T  or  A = L*D*L**T

            where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
            triangular matrices, U**T is the transpose of U, and D is symmetric and
            block diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

            This is the unblocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 2 BLAS.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                     Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the
                     symmetric matrix A is stored:
                     = 'U':  Upper triangular
                     = 'L':  Lower triangular

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                     The order of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
                     n-by-n upper triangular part of A contains the upper
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
                     leading n-by-n lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.

                     On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
                     to obtain the factor U or L (see below for further details).

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                     Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.

                     If UPLO = 'U':
                        If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
                        interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

                        If IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns
                        k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
                        is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

                     If UPLO = 'L':
                        If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
                        interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

                        If IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns
                        k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1)
                        is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0: successful exit
                     &lt; 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
                     &gt; 0: if INFO = k, D(k,k) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                          has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
                          exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it
                          is used to solve a system of equations.
