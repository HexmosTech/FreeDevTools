       MIME::QuotedPrint - Encoding and decoding of quoted-printable strings

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use MIME::QuotedPrint;

        $encoded = encode_qp($decoded);
        $decoded = decode_qp($encoded);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides functions to encode and decode strings into and from the quoted-printable encoding
       specified in RFC 2045 - <u>MIME</u> <u>(Multipurpose</u> <u>Internet</u> <u>Mail</u> <u>Extensions)</u>.  The quoted-printable encoding is
       intended to represent data that largely consists of bytes that correspond to printable characters in the
       ASCII character set.  Each non-printable character (as defined by English Americans) is represented by a
       triplet consisting of the character "=" followed by two hexadecimal digits.

       The following functions are provided:

       encode_qp( $str)
       encode_qp( $str, $eol)
       encode_qp( $str, $eol, $binmode )
           This function returns an encoded version of the string ($str) given as argument.

           The  second argument ($eol) is the line-ending sequence to use.  It is optional and defaults to "\n".
           Every occurrence of "\n" is replaced with this string, and it is also used for additional "soft  line
           breaks"  to  ensure  that no line end up longer than 76 characters.  Pass it as "\015\012" to produce
           data suitable for external  consumption.   The  string  "\r\n"  produces  the  same  result  on  many
           platforms, but not all.

           The third argument ($binmode) will select binary mode if passed as a TRUE value.  In binary mode "\n"
           will  be  encoded  in the same way as any other non-printable character.  This ensures that a decoder
           will end up with exactly the same string whatever line ending sequence it uses.   In  general  it  is
           preferable to use the base64 encoding for binary data; see MIME::Base64.

           An  $eol of "" (the empty string) is special.  In this case, no "soft line breaks" are introduced and
           binary mode is effectively enabled so that any "\n" in the original data is encoded as well.

       decode_qp( $str )
           This function returns the plain text version of the string given  as  argument.   The  lines  of  the
           result are "\n" terminated, even if the $str argument contains "\r\n" terminated lines.

       If you prefer not to import these routines into your namespace, you can call them as:

         use MIME::QuotedPrint ();
         $encoded = MIME::QuotedPrint::encode($decoded);
         $decoded = MIME::QuotedPrint::decode($encoded);

       Perl  v5.8  and  better  allow  extended  Unicode  characters in strings.  Such strings cannot be encoded
       directly, as the quoted-printable encoding is only defined for single-byte characters.  The  solution  is
       to use the Encode module to select the byte encoding you want.  For example:

           use MIME::QuotedPrint qw(encode_qp);
           use Encode qw(encode);

           $encoded = encode_qp(encode("UTF-8", "\x{FFFF}\n"));
           print $encoded;
