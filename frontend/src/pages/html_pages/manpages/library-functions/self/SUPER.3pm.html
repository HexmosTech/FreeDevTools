       SUPER - control superclass method dispatch

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Find the parent method that would run if this weren't here:

           sub my_method
           {
               my $self = shift;
               my $super = $self-&gt;super('my_method'); # Who's your daddy?

               if ($want_to_deal_with_this)
               {
                   # ...
               }
               else
               {
                   $super-&gt;($self, @_)
               }
           }

       Or Ruby-style:

           sub my_method
           {
               my $self = shift;

               if ($want_to_deal_with_this)
               {
                   # ...
               }
               else
               {
                   super;
               }
           }

       Or call the super method manually, with respect to inheritance, and passing different arguments:

           sub my_method
           {
               my $self = shift;

               # parent handles args backwardly
               $self-&gt;SUPER( reverse @_ );
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When subclassing a class, you occasionally want to dispatch control to the superclass -- at least
       conditionally and temporarily. The Perl syntax for calling your superclass is ugly and unwieldy:

           $self-&gt;SUPER::method(@_);

       especially when compared to its Ruby equivalent:

           super;

       It's even worse in that the normal Perl redispatch mechanism only dispatches to the parent of the class
       containing the method <u>at</u> <u>compile</u> <u>time</u>.  That doesn't work very well for mixins and roles.

       This module provides nicer equivalents, along with the universal method "super" to determine a class' own
       superclass. This allows you to do things such as:

           goto &amp;{$_[0]-&gt;super('my_method')};

       if you don't like wasting precious stack frames.

       If you are using roles or mixins or otherwise pulling in methods from other packages that need to
       dispatch to their super methods, or if you want to pass different arguments to the super method, use the
       "SUPER()" method:

           $self-&gt;SUPER( qw( other arguments here ) );

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b> <b>and</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides the following functions and methods:

       "super()"
           This  function  calls  the  super method of the currently-executing method, no matter where the super
           method is in the hierarchy.

           This takes no arguments; it passes the same arguments passed to the currently-executing method.

           The module exports this function by default.

           <u>Note</u>: you <u>must</u> have the appropriate "package" declaration in place for this to work.   That  is,  you
           must  have  <u>compiled</u>  the method in which you use this function in the package from which you want to
           use it.  Them's the breaks with Perl 5.

       "find_parent( $class, $method, $prune, $invocant )"
           Attempts to find a parent implementation of $method starting with $class.  If  you  pass  $prune,  it
           will  not  ignore the method found in that package, if it exists there.  Pass $invocant if the object
           itself might have a different idea of its parents.

           The module does not export this function by default.  Call it directly.

       "get_all_parents( $invocant, $class )"
           Returns all of the parents for the $invocant, if it supports  the  "__get_parents()"  method  or  the
           contents of @ISA for $class.  You probably oughtn't call this on your own.

       "SUPER()"
           Calls the super method of the currently-executing method.  You <u>can</u> pass arguments.  This is a method.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Beware:</u>  if  you  do  weird things with code generation, be sure to <u>name</u> your anonymous subroutines.  See
       <u>Perl</u> <u>Hacks</u> #57.

       Using "super" doesn't let you pass alternate arguments to your superclass's method. If you want  to  pass
       different arguments, use "SUPER" instead.  D'oh.

       This  module  does a small amount of Deep Magic to find the arguments of method <u>calling</u> "super()" itself.
       This may confuse tools such as "Devel::Cover".

       In your own code, if you do complicated things with proxy objects and the like, define  "__get_parents()"
       to return a list of all parents of the object to which you really want to dispatch.
