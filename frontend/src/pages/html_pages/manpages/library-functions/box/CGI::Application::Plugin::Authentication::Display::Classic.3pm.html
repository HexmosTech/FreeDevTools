</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Display::Classic - login box that works out of the box

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a login box that works out of the box but which can be configured to modify the
       styling.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       The constructor must be passed the CGI::Application object as the first non-object argument.

   <b>login_box</b>
       This method will return the HTML for a login box that can be embedded into another page.  This is the
       same login box that is used in the default authen_login runmode that the plugin provides.

       You can set this option to customize the login form that is created when a user needs to be
       authenticated.  If you wish to replace the entire login form with a completely custom version, then just
       set LOGIN_RUNMODE to point to your custom runmode.

       All of the parameters listed below are optional, and a reasonable default will be used if left blank:

       TITLE (default: Sign In)
           the heading at the top of the login box

       USERNAME_LABEL (default: User Name)
           the label for the user name input

       PASSWORD_LABEL (default: Password)
           the label for the password input

       SUBMIT_LABEL (default: Sign In)
           the label for the submit button

       COMMENT (default: Please enter your username and password in the fields below.)
           a message provided on the first login attempt

       REMEMBERUSER_OPTION (default: 1)
           provide  a  checkbox  to offer to remember the users name in a cookie so that their user name will be
           pre-filled the next time they log in

       REMEMBERUSER_LABEL (default: Remember User Name)
           the label for the remember user name checkbox

       REMEMBERUSER_COOKIENAME (default: CAPAUTHTOKEN)
           the name of the cookie where the user name will be saved

       REGISTER_URL (default: &lt;none&gt;)
           the URL for the register new account link

       REGISTER_LABEL (default: Register Now!)
           the label for the register new account link

       FORGOTPASSWORD_URL (default: &lt;none&gt;)
           the URL for the forgot password link

       FORGOTPASSWORD_LABEL (default: Forgot Password?)
           the label for the forgot password link

       INVALIDPASSWORD_MESSAGE (default: Invalid username or password&lt;br /&gt;(login attempt %d)
           a message given when a login failed

       INCLUDE_STYLESHEET (default: 1)
           use this to disable the built in style-sheet for the login box so you can  provide  your  own  custom
           styles

       FORM_SUBMIT_METHOD (default: post)
           use this to get the form to submit using 'get' instead of 'post'

       FOCUS_FORM_ONLOAD (default: 1)
           use  this  to automatically focus the login form when the page loads so a user can start typing right
           away.

       BASE_COLOUR (default: #445588)
           This is the base colour that will be  used  in  the  included  login  box.   All  other  colours  are
           automatically  calculated  based on this colour (unless you hardcode the colour values).  In order to
           calculate other colours, you will need the Color::Calc module.  If you do not  have  the  Color::Calc
           module,  then  you  will  need  to use fixed values for all of the colour options.  All colour values
           besides the BASE_COLOUR can be simple percentage values (including the % sign).  For example  if  you
           set  the  LIGHTER_COLOUR  option  to  80%,  then  the  calculated colour will be 80% lighter than the
           BASE_COLOUR.

       LIGHT_COLOUR (default: 50% or #a2aac4)
           A colour that is lighter than the base colour.

       LIGHTER_COLOUR (default: 75% or #d0d5e1)
           A colour that is another step lighter than the light colour.

       DARK_COLOUR (default: 30% or #303c5f)
           A colour that is darker than the base colour.

       DARKER_COLOUR (default: 60% or #1b2236)
           A colour that is another step darker than the dark colour.

       GREY_COLOUR (default: #565656)
           A grey colour that is calculated by desaturating the base colour.

         LOGIN_FORM =&gt; {
           TITLE              =&gt; 'Login',
           SUBMIT_LABEL       =&gt; 'Login',
           REMEMBERUSER_LABEL =&gt; 1,
           BASE_COLOUR        =&gt; '#0099FF',
           LIGHTER_COLOUR     =&gt; '#AAFFFF',
           DARK_COLOUR        =&gt; '50%',
         }
