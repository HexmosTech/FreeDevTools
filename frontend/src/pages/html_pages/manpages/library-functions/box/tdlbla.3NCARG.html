       TDLBLA - This routine is called to put labels on a particular edge of a box.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL TDLBLA (IAXS, ILBL, NLBL, XAT0, XAT1, YAT0, YAT1, ANGD)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_tdlbla(int iaxs, char* ilbl, char* nlbl, float xat0, float xat1, float yat0, float yat1, float
       angd)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       It is assumed that TDPARA has been called to define the reference parallelogram to be a rectangle in
       3-space lying in one corner of one face of the box being labelled. The sides of this rectangle are
       assumed to be vectors of length 1 (that is to say, the rectangle defines a unit square within that face
       of the box). It is also assumed that the value of the internal parameter 'CS2' has been set in the same
       way that TDLBLS would reset it, using a code sequence like

         CALL TDGETR ('CS1',CSM1)
         CSM2=CSM1*MIN(UMAX-UMIN,VMAX-VMIN,WMAX-WMIN)
         CALL TDSETR ('CS2',CSM2)

       (where UMIN, UMAX, VMIN, VMAX, WMIN, and WMAX are as defined for a call to TDLBLS).

       The arguments of TDLBLA are as follows:

       IAXS    (an input expression of type INTEGER) - says which edge of the face is being labelled (1 =&gt; left,
               2 =&gt; right, 3 =&gt; bottom, and 4 =&gt; top, where the meanings of "left", "right", "bottom", and "top"
               are defined by the orientation of the reference parallelogram).

       ILBL    (input,  of  type  CHARACTER)  - a string to be used as an informational label.  If the string is
               blank, no informational label is written.

       NLBL    (input, of type CHARACTER) - a string containing numeric labels. The labels need not  be  in  any
               particular  order,  but  they  have to be separated by blanks and each has to be readable using a
               FORTRAN format of the form "En.0", where "n" is the length of the label. If the string is  blank,
               no informational label is written.

       XAT0 and XAT1
               (input  expressions of type REAL) - the values of "X" associated with the left and right edges of
               the face being labelled, where "left" and "right" are defined in terms of the  current  reference
               parallelogram.

       YAT0 and YAT1
               (input  expressions of type REAL) - the values of "Y" associated with the bottom and top edges of
               the face being labelled, where "bottom" and "top" are defined in terms of the  current  reference
               parallelogram.

       ANGD    (an  input expression of type REAL) - specifies the angle, in degrees, at which the labels are to
               be written. This angle is defined with reference to the current reference parallelogram.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use TDLBLA or c_tdlbla, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably  in
       that order.
