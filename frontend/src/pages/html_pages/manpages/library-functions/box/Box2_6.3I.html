       Box, HBox, VBox - tile interactors in a box

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;InterViews/box.h&gt;</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  box  is  a  scene  of interactors that are tiled side-by-side in the available space.  Interactors are
       placed left-to-right in a horizontal box, and top-to-bottom in a vertical box.

       A box will try to stretch or shrink the interactors inside it to fit the available  space.   The  natural
       size  of  a box is the sum of its elements along the major axis, and the maximum along its minor axis.  A
       box's stretchability (shrinkability) is the sum of its elements along its major axis and the  minimum  of
       its elements along its minor axis.

</pre><h4><b>PUBLIC</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>HBox(...)</b>
       <b>VBox(...)</b>
              Create  a  new  box.   Zero  to  seven interactors may be passed as arguments; the interactors are
              inserted into the box.

       <b>void</b> <b>Align(Alignment)</b>
              Set the alignment mode that the box uses to place elements along  the  minor  axis.   The  default
              alignment  for  an  hbox is <u>Bottom</u>; other choices are <u>Top</u> and <u>Center</u>.  The default alignment for a
              vbox is <u>Left</u>; other choices are <u>Right</u> and <u>Center</u>.

       <b>void</b> <b>Insert(Interactor*)</b>
              Append an interactor to the box.  Components of an hbox (vbox) will appear left-to-right  (top-to-
              bottom) in the order in which they are inserted.

       <b>void</b> <b>Change(Interactor*)</b>
              Notify  the box that the given interactor's shape has changed.  If change propagation is true, the
              box will modify its own shape to  reflect  the  change  and  notify  its  parent.   Regardless  of
              propagation, the box will recompute the positions of the component interactors and update any that
              have changed.

       <b>void</b> <b>Remove(Interactor*)</b>
              Take  an element of out a box.  Remove does not cause any immediate change to the other components
              in the box; the Change operation must be called after one or more Removes to update the  component
              positions.
