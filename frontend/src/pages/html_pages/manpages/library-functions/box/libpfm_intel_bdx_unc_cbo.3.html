       libpfm_intel_bdx_unc_cbo - support for Intel Broadwell Server C-Box uncore PMU

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU</b> <b>name:</b> <b>bdx_unc_cbo[0-21]</b>
       <b>PMU</b> <b>desc:</b> <b>Intel</b> <b>Broadwell</b> <b>Server</b> <b>C-Box</b> <b>uncore</b> <b>PMU</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  library  supports  the  Intel  Broadwell Server C-Box (coherency engine) uncore PMU.  This PMU model
       exists on various Broadwell server models (79, 86) . There is one C-box PMU per physical core.  Therefore
       there  are  up to twenty-one identical C-Box PMU instances numbered from 0 to 21. On dual-socket systems,
       the number refers to the C-Box PMU on the socket where the program runs.  For  instance,  if  running  on
       CPU18,  then  bdx_unc_cbo0 refers to the C-Box for physical core 0 on socket 1. Conversely, if running on
       CPU0, then the same bdx_unc_cbo0 refers to the C-Box for physical core 0 but on socket 0.

       Each C-Box PMU implements 4 generic counters and two filter registers used only with certain  events  and
       umasks.

</pre><h4><b>MODIFIERS</b></h4><pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel Broadwell C-Box uncore PMU:

       <b>e</b>      Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a state transition from no occurrence of the
              event  to  at  least  one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with a threshold modifier (t)
              with a value greater or equal to one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>t</b>      Set the threshold value. When set to a non-zero value, the counter  counts  the  number  of  C-Box
              cycles in which the number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to the threshold.  This
              is an integer modifier with values in the range [0:255].

       <b>nf</b>     Node  filter.  Certain  events,  such as UNC_C_LLC_LOOKUP, UNC_C_LLC_VICTIMS, provide a <b>NID</b> umask.
              Sometimes the <b>NID</b> is combined with other filtering capabilities, such as opcodes.  The node filter
              is an 8-bit max bitmask. A node corresponds to a processor  socket.  The  legal  values  therefore
              depend  on  the  underlying  hardware  configuration. For dual-socket systems, the bitmask has two
              valid bits [0:1].

       <b>cf</b>     Core Filter. This is a 5-bit filter which is used to filter based on physical core origin  of  the
              C-Box  request.  Possible values are 0-63. If the filter is not specified, then no filtering takes
              place. Bit  0-3 indicate  the physical core id and bit 4 filters on non thread-related data.

       <b>tf</b>     Thread Filter. This is a 1-bit filter which is used to filter  C-Box  requests  based  on  logical
              processor (hyper-thread) identification. Possibles values are 0-1. If the filter is not specified,
              then no filtering takes place.

       <b>nc</b>     Non-Coherent.  This  is  a  1-bit  filter  which  is  used  to  filter C-Box requests only for the
              TOR_INSERTS and TOR_OCCUPANCY umasks using the OPCODE matcher. If the  filter  is  not  specified,
              then no filtering takes place.

       <b>isoc</b>   Isochronous.  This  is  a  1-bit  filter  which  is  used  to  filter  C-Box requests only for the
              TOR_INSERTS and TOR_OCCUPANCY umasks using the OPCODE matcher. If the  filter  is  not  specified,
              then no filtering takes place.

</pre><h4><b>Opcode</b> <b>filtering</b></h4><pre>
       Certain  events, such as UNC_C_TOR_INSERTS supports opcode matching on the C-BOX transaction type. To use
       this feature, first an opcode matching umask must be selected, e.g., MISS_OPCODE.  Second, the opcode  to
       match   on   must   be   selected   via   a   second   umask  among  the  OPC_*  umasks.   For  instance,
       UNC_C_TOR_INSERTS:OPCODE:OPC_RFO, counts the number of TOR insertions for RFO transactions.

       Opcode matching may be combined with node filtering  with  certain  umasks.  In  general,  the  filtering
       support  is  encoded  into  the umask name, e.g., NID_OPCODE supports both node and opcode filtering. For
       instance, UNC_C_TOR_INSERTS:NID_OPCODE:OPC_RFO:nf=1.
