       libpfm_intel_snbep_unc_cbo - support for Intel Sandy Bridge-EP C-Box uncore PMU

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU</b> <b>name:</b> <b>snbep_unc_cbo[0-7]</b>
       <b>PMU</b> <b>desc:</b> <b>Intel</b> <b>Sandy</b> <b>Bridge-EP</b> <b>C-Box</b> <b>uncore</b> <b>PMU</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  library  supports  the  Intel Sandy Bridge C-Box (coherency engine) uncore PMU.  This PMU model only
       exists on Sandy Bridge model 45. There is one C-box PMU per physical  core.  Therefore  there  are  eight
       identical  C-Box  PMU instances numbered frmo 0 to 7. On dual-socket systems, the number refers to the C-
       Box PMU on the socket where the program runs. For instance,  if  running  on  CPU8,  then  snbep_unc_cbo0
       refers  to  the  C-Box  for  physical  core  0 on socket 1. Conversely, if running on CPU0, then the same
       snbep_unc_cbo0 refers to the C-Box for physical core 0 but on socket 0.

       Each C-Box PMU implements 4 generic counters and a filter register used  only  with  certain  events  and
       umasks.

</pre><h4><b>MODIFIERS</b></h4><pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel Sandy Bridge C-Box uncore PMU:

       <b>i</b>      Invert the meaning of the event. The counter will now count C-Box cycles in which the event is <b>not</b>
              occurring. This is a boolean modifier

       <b>e</b>      Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a state transition from no occurrence of the
              event  to  at  least  one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with a threshold modifier (t)
              with a value greater or equal to one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>t</b>      Set the threshold value. When set to a non-zero value, the counter  counts  the  number  of  C-Box
              cycles in which the number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to the threshold.  This
              is an integer modifier with values in the range [0:255].

       <b>nf</b>     Node  filter.  Certain  events,  such as UNC_C_LLC_LOOKUP, UNC_C_LLC_VICTIMS, provide a <b>NID</b> umask.
              Sometimes the <b>NID</b> is combined with other filtering capabilities, such as opcodes.  The node filter
              is an 8-bit max bitmask. A node corresponds to a processor  socket.  The  legal  values  therefore
              depend  on  the  underlying  hardware  configuration. For dual-socket systems, the bitmask has two
              valid bits [0:1].

       <b>cf</b>     Core Filter. This is a 3-bit filter which is used to filter based on physical core origin  of  the
              C-Box  request.  Possible  values are 0-7. If the filter is not specified, then no filtering takes
              place.

       <b>tf</b>     Thread Filter. This is a 1-bit filter which is used to filter  C-Box  requests  based  on  logical
              processor (hyper-thread) identification. Possibles values are 0-1. If the filter is not specified,
              then no filtering takes place.

</pre><h4><b>Opcode</b> <b>filtering</b></h4><pre>
       Certain  events, such as UNC_C_TOR_INSERTS supports opcode matching on the C-BOX transaction type. To use
       this feature, first an opcode matching umask must be selected, e.g., MISS_OPCODE.  Second, the opcode  to
       match   on   must   be   selected   via   a   second   umask  among  the  OPC_*  umasks.   For  instance,
       UNC_C_TOR_INSERTS:OPCODE:OPC_RFO, counts the number of TOR insertions for RFO transactions.

       Opcode matching may be combined with node filtering with certain umasks. In general the filtering support
       is encoded into the umask name, e.g., NID_OPCODE supports both node and opcode filtering.  For  instance,
       UNC_C_TOR_INSERTS:NID_OPCODE:OPC_RFO:nf=1.
