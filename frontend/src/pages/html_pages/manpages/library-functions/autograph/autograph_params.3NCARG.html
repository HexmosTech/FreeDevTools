</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Autograph_params - This document briefly describes all Autograph internal parameters.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Autograph control parameters reside in the labeled common block AGCONP. There are currently 485 of
       them, of which 336 are "primary" and 149 are "secondary". Primary control parameters have default values
       and are subject to change by a user program to produce some desired effect on the behavior of Autograph
       and/or on the nature of a graph being drawn. Secondary control parameters are computed by Autograph
       itself and are not normally subject to change by a user program.

       User access to these parameters is provided by the routines AGGETC, AGGETF, AGGETI, AGGETP, AGGETR,
       AGSETC, AGSETF, AGSETI, AGSETP, and AGSETR.  The first argument in a call to one of these routines is a
       character string naming a group of parameters (perhaps containing only a single parameter) which the user
       wishes to "set" or "get". Each such string has the form ´k1/k2/k3/ . . . kn.´, where k1 is a keyword
       identifying a major group of parameters, k2 is a keyword identifying a subgroup of that major group, k3
       is a keyword identifying a further subgroup of that subgroup, and so on. Only the first three characters
       of k1 and the first two characters of the others need be used; also, certain keywords may be omitted.

       Because of certain portability considerations, all of the parameters have real values. The routine AGSETP
       may be used to set the real values of the parameters in any group, and the routine AGGETP to retrieve
       those values. Either of the routines AGSETF or AGSETR may be used to set the real value of a single
       parameter and either of the routines AGGETF or AGGETR may be used to get the real value of a single
       parameter.

       Some parameters may only take on discrete integral values (like "0.", "1.", "-6.", or "65535.") and are
       used in roles for which integers would normally be used. The routine AGSETI may be used to set the
       integer value of a single parameter of this type and the routine AGGETI may be used to get the integer
       value of a single parameter of this type.

       Other parameters intrinsically represent character strings; the real value of the parameter is an
       identifier, generated when the character string is passed to Autograph and enabling the character string
       to be retrieved from Autograph´s character storage space when it is needed. The routine AGSETC must be
       used to set the character-string value associated with a single parameter of this type and the routine
       AGGETC must be used to get the character-string value associated with a single parameter of this type.

       Many parameters have a limited range of acceptable values.  What generally happens when a parameter is
       given an out-of-range value is that Autograph (usually the routine AGSTUP) resets that value to the value
       at the nearer end of the acceptable range.

       Setting certain parameters (individually, rather than as part of a multi-parameter group) implies, as a
       side effect, "special action" by the routine AGSETP (which may be called directly by the user or
       indirectly by way of a user call to AGSETC, AGSETF, AGSETI, or AGSETR). For example, setting the
       parameter ´BACKGROUND.´ to request a particular background type causes a number of other parameters to be
       changed in order to achieve the desired result.

       Each of the named parameter groups is described below.  Square brackets are used to mark portions of a
       name which may be omitted; the notation ´k1/k2/ . . . [ki/]...kn.´ indicates that the keyword ki and the
       following slash may be omitted. In each description, the simplest form of the name is given. If a multi-
       parameter group is named, its subgroups are listed, in the order in which they occur in the group. If a
       single parameter is named, the default value of that parameter is given and any "special action" by
       AGSETP is described.

       ´PRIMARY.´
              Simplest form of name: ´PRI.´

              This  group  consists  of  all  336  primary control parameters, in the order in which they appear
              below. It was originally provided to give users the capability of saving and restoring  the  state
              of Autograph. The routines AGSAVE and AGRSTR (which see) should now be used for this purpose.

       ´FRAME.´
              Simplest form of name: ´FRA.´

              An  integral  real number specifying when a frame advance is to be done by the routines EZY, EZXY,
              EZMY, and EZMXY and having one of three possible values:

              •   The value "1." specifies a frame advance after drawing a graph.

              •   The value "2." specifies no frame advance at all.

              •   The value "3." specifies a frame advance before drawing a graph.

              Default value: "1." (frame advance after drawing graph).

       ´SET.´ Simplest form of name: ´SET.´

              An integral real number specifying whether or not the arguments of the last call to "SET" are used
              to determine the linear/log nature of the current graph, the position of the  grid  window  and/or
              the X/Y minimum/maximum values.

              (Note:  The  routine  SET  is part of the package called SPPS.  Its first four arguments specify a
              portion of the plotter frame, its next four arguments specify the minimum  and  maximum  X  and  Y
              coordinate  values  to  be mapped to that portion, and its ninth argument specifies the linear/log
              nature of the mapping. The routine GETSET, which is also a part of SPPS, is used to  retrieve  the
              arguments of the last call to SET.)

              Giving  ´SET.´ a value (individually, rather than as part of a group) has both an immediate effect
              and a delayed effect.  The immediate effect, which occurs in the routine AGSETP, is to return most
              of the parameters in the groups ´GRID.´, ´X.´, and ´Y.´ to their default values.  (Exceptions  are
              ´X/LOGARITHMIC.´  and  ´Y/LOGARITHMIC.´,  which  may  have  values  making  them  immune  to  such
              resetting.)  The delayed effect, which occurs in the routine AGSTUP, depends on the value given to
              ´SET.´.

              There are eight acceptable values of ´SET.´, four of which are just the  negatives  of  the  other
              four.  Using a negated value suppresses the drawing of curves by the routines EZY, EZXY, EZMY, and
              EZMXY. Acceptable absolute values of ´SET.´ are as follows:

              •      The value "1." means that the arguments of the last SET call are not to be used by AGSTUP.

              •      The value "2." means that, in AGSTUP, ´X/LOGARITHMIC.´ and ´Y/LOGARITHMIC.´ are to be given
                     values ("0." or "-1.")  consistent with the ninth argument of the last SET  call  and  that
                     parameters  in  the  group  ´GRID.´  are  to be given values consistent with the first four
                     arguments of the last SET call.

              •      The value "3." means that, in AGSTUP, ´X/LOGARITHMIC.´ and ´Y/LOGARITHMIC.´ are to be given
                     values ("0." or "-1.")  consistent with the ninth argument of the last SET  call  and  that
                     the other parameters in the groups ´X.´ and ´Y.´ are to be given values consistent with the
                     fifth through eighth arguments of the last SET call.

              •      The value "4." implies a combination of the actions specified by the values "2." and "3.".

              Default value: "1." (no arguments of last SET call used).

              Special  action by AGSETP: As described above, if ´SET.´ is set (individually, rather than as part
              of a group) to any value by an AGSETP call, the parameters in the groups ´GRID.´, ´X.´,  and  ´Y.´
              are  reset  to their default values.  The parameter ´X/LOGARITHMIC.´ is reset to its default value
              ("0.") only if it has the value "+1."; a value of  "-1."   is  not  changed;  ´Y/LOGARITHMIC.´  is
              treated similarly.

       ´ROW.´ Simplest form of name: ´ROW.´

              An integral real number specifying the assumed dimensioning of X and Y coordinate data arrays used
              in calls to the routines EZMY and EZMXY. There are four possibilities:

              •      The  value  "-2."  means that both X and Y arrays are subscripted by curve number and point
                     number, in that order.

              •      The value "-1." means that Y arrays are subscripted by curve number and  point  number,  in
                     that  order, but that X arrays are subscripted by point number only. (The same X-coordinate
                     data is used for all the curves.)

              •      Either of the values "0." or "1." means that Y arrays are subscripted by point  number  and
                     curve  number,  in that order, but that X arrays are subscripted by point number only. (The
                     same X-coordinate data is used for all of the curves.)

              •      The value "+2." means that both X and Y arrays are subscripted by point  number  and  curve
                     number, in that order.

              Default value: "1." (Y by point and curve numbers, X by point number only).

       ´INVERT.´
              Simplest form of name: ´INV.´

              An  integral  real  number  having  the  value  "0."  or "1."; giving it the value "1." causes the
              routines AGSTUP and AGCURV  to  behave  as  if  arguments  defining  X-coordinate  data  had  been
              interchanged with arguments defining Y-coordinate data, thus, in some sense, allowing one to graph
              "X  as  a  function  of  Y". This parameter is principally intended for users of the routines EZY,
              EZXY, EZMY, and EZMXY.

              Default value: "0." (no inversion of X and Y arguments).

       ´WINDOW.´
              Simplest form of name: ´WIN.´

              An integral real number having the value "0." or "1."; giving it the value "1." causes the routine
              AGCURV to use the subroutine AGQURV, rather than AGKURV, for drawing curves. The  result  is  that
              curve portions falling outside the grid window are omitted. See the AGCURV man page.

              Default value: "0." (no windowing of curves).

       ´BACKGROUND.´
              Simplest form of name: ´BAC.´

              An  integral  real  number specifying the type of background to be drawn by AGBACK. There are four
              acceptable values:

              •      The value "1." specifies a "perimeter" background.

              •      The value "2." specifies a "grid" background.

              •      The value "3." specifies a "half-axis" background.

              •      The value "4." specifies no background at all.

              Default value: "1." (a "perimeter" background).

              Special action by AGSETP: If ´BACKGROUND.´ is set (individually, rather than as part of  a  group)
              by a call to AGSETP, the desired background is created by changing the following parameters:

                 ´[AXIS/]s/CONTROL.´
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/[LENGTH/]INWARD.´
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MINOR/[LENGTH/]INWARD.´
                 ´LABEL/CONTROL.´

              where  "s" stands for "LEFT", "RIGHT", "BOTTOM", and "TOP".  This determines which of the axes are
              plotted, how long the inward-pointing portions of major and  minor  tick  marks  are  to  be,  and
              whether or not informational labels are to be plotted. Values used are as follows:

              The value "1." (perimeter background) sets:

                ´s/CONTROL.´ to "4." for all s;
                ´s/MAJOR/INWARD.´ to ".015" for all s;
                ´s/MINOR/INWARD.´ to ".010" for all s;
                ´LABEL/CONTROL.´ to "2.".

              The value "2." (grid background) sets:

                ´s/CONTROL.´ to "4." for "s" = "LEFT" and "BOTTOM",
                ´s/CONTROL.´ to "-1." for "s" = "RIGHT" and "TOP";
                ´s/MAJOR/INWARD.´ to "1." for all s;
                ´s/MINOR/INWARD.´ to "1." for all s;
                ´LABEL/CONTROL.´ to "2.".

              The value "3." (half-axis background) sets:

                ´s/CONTROL.´ to "4." for "s" = "LEFT" and "BOTTOM",
                ´s/CONTROL.´ to "-1." for "s" = "RIGHT" and "TOP";
                ´s/MAJOR/INWARD.´ to ".015" for all s;
                ´s/MINOR/INWARD.´ to ".010" for all s;
                ´LABEL/CONTROL.´ to "2.".

              The value "4." (no background) sets:

                ´s/CONTROL.´ to "0." for all s;
                ´s/MAJOR/INWARD.´ to ".015 for all s;
                ´s/MINOR/INWARD.´ to ".010" for all s;
                ´LABEL/CONTROL.´ to "0.".

              The  default values of these thirteen parameters correspond to the default value of ´BACKGROUND.´.
              Note that, if they are changed directly, the value of ´BACKGROUND.´ may  not  reflect  the  actual
              nature of the background defined by them.

       ´NULL.´
              Simplest form of name: ´NUL.´

              This group contains the two "nulls" (or "special values") ´NULL/1.´ and ´NULL/2.´.

       ´NULL/1.´
              Simplest form of name: ´NUL/1.´

              A real number "null 1", used in the following ways by Autograph:

              •      Certain  parameters  have  by default, or may be given, the value "null 1", specifying that
                     the routine AGSTUP is to choose values for them. The value chosen for a given parameter  is
                     not  back-stored  in  place  of  the "null 1"; thus, a unique value will be chosen for each
                     graph drawn.

              •      If a curve point specified by the user has X and/or Y coordinates equal to "null  1",  that
                     curve  point  is  ignored.   It is not used in computing minimum and maximum values.  Curve
                     segments on either side of it are not drawn.

              Default value: "1.E36" (an arbitrary value).

              Special action by AGSETP: If ´NULL/1.´ is changed (individually, rather than as part of  a  group)
              by  an  AGSETP call, the entire list of primary parameters is scanned - any value equal to the old
              "null 1" is replaced by the new one.

       ´NULL/2.´
              Simplest form of name: ´NUL/2.´

              A real number "null 2". Certain parameters may be given the value "null 2",  specifying  that  the
              routine AGSTUP is to choose values for them. The value chosen for a given parameter is back-stored
              in  place  of the "null 2"; thus, a unique value may be chosen for the first graph of a series and
              then used for all remaining graphs in the series.

              Default value: "2.E36" (an arbitrary value).

              Special action by AGSETP: If ´NULL/2.´ is changed (individually, rather than as part of  a  group)
              by  an  AGSETP call, the entire list of primary parameters is scanned - any value equal to the old
              "null 2" is replaced by the new one.

       ´GRAPH.´
              Simplest form of name: ´GRA.´

              A group of four parameters describing the position of the "graph window" within the plotter frame.
              A graph drawn by Autograph (including labels) is  forced  to  lie  entirely  within  this  window.
              Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´GRAPH/LEFT.´   (1)
                 ´GRAPH/RIGHT.´  (1)
                 ´GRAPH/BOTTOM.´ (1)
                 ´GRAPH/TOP.´    (1)

       ´GRAPH/LEFT.´
              Simplest form of name: ´GRA/LE.´

              A  real  number between "0." and "1." specifying the position of the left edge of the graph window
              as a fraction of the distance from the left edge to the right edge of the plotter frame.

              Default value: "0." (left edge of plotter frame).

       ´GRAPH/RIGHT.´
              Simplest form of name: ´GRA/RI.´

              A real number between "0." and "1." specifying the position of the right edge of the graph  window
              as a fraction of the distance from the left edge to the right edge of the plotter frame.

              Default value: "1." (right edge of plotter frame).

       ´GRAPH/BOTTOM.´
              Simplest form of name: ´GRA/BO.´

              A real number between "0." and "1." specifying the position of the bottom edge of the graph window
              as a fraction of the distance from the bottom edge to the top edge of the plotter frame.

              Default value: "0." (bottom edge of plotter frame).

       ´GRAPH/TOP.´
              Simplest form of name: ´GRA/TO.´

              A real number between "0." and "1." specifying the position of the top edge of the graph window as
              a fraction of the distance from the bottom edge to the top edge of the plotter frame.

              Default value: "0." (top edge of plotter frame).

       ´GRID.´
              Simplest form of name: ´GRI.´

              A group of five parameters describing the position and shape of the "grid window" within the graph
              window.  Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´GRID/LEFT.´   (1)
                 ´GRID/RIGHT.´  (1)
                 ´GRID/BOTTOM.´ (1)
                 ´GRID/TOP.´    (1)
                 ´GRID/SHAPE.´  (1)

       ´GRID/LEFT.´
              Simplest form of name: ´GRI/LE.´

              A  real number between "0." and "1." specifying the position of the left edge of the area in which
              the grid window is to be placed, stated as a fraction of the distance from the left  edge  to  the
              right edge of the graph window.

              Default value: ".15".

       ´GRID/RIGHT.´
              Simplest form of name: ´GRI/RI.´

              A real number between "0." and "1." specifying the position of the right edge of the area in which
              the  grid  window  is to be placed, stated as a fraction of the distance from the left edge to the
              right edge of the graph window.

              Default value: ".95".

       ´GRID/BOTTOM.´
              Simplest form of name: ´GRI/BO.´

              A real number between "0." and "1." specifying the position of the bottom  edge  of  the  area  in
              which  the  grid window is to be placed, stated as a fraction of the distance from the bottom edge
              to the top edge of the graph window.

              Default value: ".15".

       ´GRID/TOP.´
              Simplest form of name: ´GRI/TO.´

              A real number between "0." and "1." specifying the position of the top edge of the area  in  which
              the  grid window is to be placed, stated as a fraction of the distance from the bottom edge to the
              top edge of the graph window.

              Default value: ".95".

       ´GRID/SHAPE.´
              Simplest form of name: ´GRI/SH.´

              A real number specifying the shape of the grid window. The grid window,  whatever  its  shape,  is
              centered  in, and made as large as possible in, the area specified by the first four parameters in
              the group ´GRID.´. The value of ´GRID/SHAPE.´ falls in one of four possible ranges, as follows:

              •      A value less than "0." specifies the negative of the desired ratio  of  the  grid  window´s
                     width to its height. For example, the value "-2." specifies a grid window which is twice as
                     wide as it is high.

              •      The  value  "0." specifies a grid window of exactly the same shape as the area specified by
                     the first four parameters in the group ´GRID.´. The grid window therefore fills  that  area
                     completely.

              •      A  value "s" between "0." and "1." specifies a grid window whose shape is determined by the
                     range of the user´s coordinate data, reverting to the shape of the area  specified  by  the
                     first  four  arguments  in  the  group ´GRID.´ if the ratio of the shorter side of the grid
                     window to the longer side of the grid window would thereby  be  made  less  than  "s".  For
                     example,  if  "s"  were given the value ".5" and the user X coordinate data ranged in value
                     from "0." to "10." and the user Y coordinate data ranged in value from "0." to  "15.",  the
                     grid  window  would be made two-thirds as wide as it was high; however, if the Y coordinate
                     data ranged in value from "0." to "100.", the grid window would not be  made  one-tenth  as
                     wide  as  it  is  high,  but would instead be made to fill the entire area specified by the
                     first four arguments of the group ´GRID.´.

              •      A value "s" greater than or equal to "1." specifies a grid window whose shape is determined
                     by the range of the user´s coordinate data, reverting to a  square  if  the  ratio  of  the
                     longer side of the grid window to the shorter side of the grid window would thereby be made
                     greater than "s".

              Note  that, if ´GRID/SHAPE.´ is given a value greater than "0.", Autograph assumes that the user´s
              X and Y coordinate data have the same units (both in inches, for example) and that the outline  of
              a  real  two-dimensional  object is to be graphed without distortion. The grid window is shaped in
              such a way as to accomplish this. This feature should not be used when either ´X/LOGARITHMIC.´  or
              ´Y/LOGARITHMIC.´ has a non-zero value; doing so will yield strange results.

              Note  that  either "-1." or "+1." produces a square and that "-1.61803398874989" produces a golden
              rectangle.

              Default value: "0.".

       ´X.´
              Simplest form of name: ´X.´

              A group of seven parameters specifying the mapping  of  the  user´s  X-coordinate  data  onto  the
              horizontal axis of the grid window. Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´X/MINIMUM.´     (1)
                 ´X/MAXIMUM.´     (1)
                 ´X/LOGARITHMIC.´ (1)
                 ´X/ORDER.´       (1)
                 ´X/NICE.´        (1)
                 ´X/SMALLEST.´    (1)
                 ´X/LARGEST.´     (1)

              See also ´SET.´ and ´INVERT.´, above.

       ´X/MINIMUM.´
              Simplest form of name: ´X/MI.´

              A  real  number specifying the minimum user X coordinate to be considered. This parameter normally
              has the value "null 1", specifying that the routine AGSTUP should examine the user´s  X-coordinate
              data and find the minimum value for itself.

              If  the  value "null 2" is used, it will be replaced, the next time AGSTUP is called, by an actual
              minimum value computed by AGSTUP.

              If a non-null value is used, AGSTUP will not examine the user´s X-coordinate data; the given value
              will be considered to be the minimum.

              If both ´X/MINIMUM.´ and ´X/MAXIMUM.´ are given non-null values, the former should have  a  lesser
              value than the latter.

              Default value: "1.E36" ("null 1").

       ´X/MAXIMUM.´
              Simplest form of name: ´X/MA.´

              Analogous  to ´X/MINIMUM.´, above; it specifies the way in which the maximum X coordinate is to be
              determined.

              Default value: "1.E36" ("null 1").

       ´X/LOGARITHMIC.´
              Simplest form of name: ´X/LO.´

              An integral real number having one of the values "-1.", "0.", or "+1.":

              •      The value "0." specifies that the mapping of user X coordinates onto the horizontal axis of
                     the grid window is to be linear.

              •      The values "-1." and "+1." specify that the mapping is to be logarithmic, in which case all
                     user X-coordinate data must be greater than zero.

              •      The value "-1." is immune to change when ´SET.´ (which see,  above)  is  reset;  the  value
                     "+1." is not.

              Default value: "0." (linear X mapping).

       ´X/ORDER.´
              Simplest form of name: ´X/OR.´

              An integral real number having one of the values "0." or "1.":

              •      The  value  "0."  specifies  that the values of user X coordinates mapped to the horizontal
                     axis of the grid window should increase from left to right.

              •      The value "1." specifies that user X coordinates should decrease from left to right.

              Default value: "0." (increase from left to right).

       ´X/NICE.´
              Simplest form of name: ´X/NI.´

              An integral real number having one of the values "-1.", "0.", or "+1.":

              •      The value "-1." specifies that user X-coordinate data are to be mapped onto the  horizontal
                     axis  of the grid window in such a way as to force major-tick positions at the endpoints of
                     the bottom X axis.

              •      The value "+1." specifies that user X-coordinate data are to be mapped onto the  horizontal
                     axis  of the grid window in such a way as to force major-tick positions at the endpoints of
                     the top X axis.

              •      The value "0." specifies that the X-coordinate data are to be mapped so as  to  range  from
                     the left edge of the grid window to the right edge of the grid window; major-tick positions
                     are not forced at the ends of either X axis.

              Default value: "-1." (bottom axis "nice").

       ´X/SMALLEST.´
              Simplest form of name: ´X/SM.´

              This  parameter  comes  into  play  when AGSTUP is called upon to compute the minimum X coordinate
              (when ´X/MINIMUM.´ has a null value); if the value of ´X/SMALLEST.´ is non-null, values less  than
              it will not be considered in the computation.

              Default value: "1.E36" ("null 1").

       ´X/LARGEST.´
              Simplest form of name: ´X/LA.´

              This  parameter  comes  into  play  when AGSTUP is called upon to compute the maximum X coordinate
              (when ´X/MAXIMUM.´ has a null value); if the value of ´X/LARGEST.´  is  non-null,  values  greater
              than it will not be considered in the computation.

              Default value: "1.E36" ("null 1").

       ´Y.´
              Simplest form of name: ´Y.´

              A  group  of  seven  parameters  specifying  the  mapping of the user´s Y-coordinate data onto the
              vertical axis of the grid window. Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´Y/MINIMUM.´     (1)
                 ´Y/MAXIMUM.´     (1)
                 ´Y/LOGARITHMIC.´ (1)

                 ´Y/LARGEST.´     (1)

              See also ´SET.´ and ´INVERT.´, above.

       ´Y/MINIMUM.´
              Simplest form of name: ´Y/MI.´

              Analogous to ´X/MINIMUM.´, above; it specifies the way in which the minimum Y coordinate is to  be
              determined.

              Default value: "1.E36" ("null 1").

       ´Y/MAXIMUM.´
              Simplest form of name: ´Y/MA.´

              Analogous  to ´X/MAXIMUM.´, above; it specifies the way in which the maximum Y coordinate is to be
              determined.

              Default value: "1.E36" ("null 1").

       ´Y/LOGARITHMIC.´
              Simplest form of name: ´Y/LO.´

              Analogous to ´X/LOGARITHMIC.´, above; it specifies whether the mapping of Y coordinates is  linear
              or logarithmic.

              Default value: "0." (linear Y).

       ´Y/ORDER.´
              Simplest form of name: ´Y/OR.´

              Analogous  to  ´X/ORDER.´,  above;  it  specifies  whether Y-coordinates increase or decrease from
              bottom to top.

              Default value: "0." (increase from bottom to top).

       ´Y/NICE.´
              Simplest form of name: ´Y/NI.´

              Analogous to ´X/NICE.´, above; it specifies whether the left Y axis, the right Y axis, or neither,
              is to be "nice".

              Default value: "-1." (left axis "nice").

       ´AXIS.´
              Simplest form of name: ´AXI.´

              A group of 92 parameters describing four axes: the left axis, the right axis, the bottom axis, and
              the top axis.  Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´[AXIS/]LEFT.´   (23)
                 ´[AXIS/]RIGHT.´  (23)
                 ´[AXIS/]BOTTOM.´ (23)
                 ´[AXIS/]TOP.´    (23)

              The elements of the subgroups are interleaved in the group; that is to say, the first elements  of
              the  four  subgroups constitute elements 1 through 4 of the group, the second elements of the four
              subgroups constitute elements 5 through 8 of the group, and so on.

       ´[AXIS/]s.´
              (where "s" means "any one of the keywords LEFT, RIGHT, BOTTOM, or TOP".)

              Simplest form of name: ´s.´

              A group of 23 parameters describing the axis  specified  by  "s".  Subgroups  and  the  number  of
              parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´[AXIS/]s/CONTROL.´      (1)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/LINE.´         (1)

                 ´[AXIS/]s/TICKS.´       (10)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/NUMERIC.´      (8)

       ´[AXIS/]s/CONTROL.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/CO.´

              An  integral  real  number  having  one  of  the values "-1.", "0.", "1.", "2.", "3.", or "4." and
              controlling certain aspects of the drawing of the axis specified by "s", as follows:

              •      The value "-1." specifies that only the line portion of the axis may be drawn;  tick  marks
                     and numeric labels are suppressed.

              •      The value "0." specifies that no portion of the axis may be drawn.

              •      A  positive  value  specifies that all portions of the axis may be drawn and specifies what
                     actions Autograph may take to prevent numeric-label overlap problems, as follows:

              •      The value "1." specifies that numeric labels may not be shrunk or rotated.

              •      The value "2." specifies that numeric labels may be shrunk, but not rotated.

              •      The value "3." specifies that numeric labels may be rotated, but not shrunk.

              •      The value "4." specifies that numeric labels may be both shrunk and/or rotated.

              Default value: "4." for all "s" (all axes drawn, numeric labels may be shrunk and/or rotated).

       ´[AXIS/]s/LINE.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/LI.´

              An integral real number having one of the values "0." or "1.":

              •      The value "0." specifies that the line portion of the axis specified by "s" may be drawn.

              •      The value "1." suppresses the line portion of the axis specified by "s".

       ´[AXIS/]s/INTERSECTION.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/IN.´

              A group of two parameters

                 ´[AXIS/]s/INTERSECTION/GRID.´
                 ´[AXIS/]s/INTERSECTION/USER.´

              each having the default value "1.E36" ("null 1"). Giving either of them a  non-null  value  causes
              the  axis  specified  by  "s"  to  be  moved away from its normal position on one edge of the grid
              window. If both are given non-null values, ´.../USER.´ takes precedence over ´.../GRID.´.

              If the left Y axis or the right Y axis is moved, it remains vertical, but intersects the bottom of
              the grid window at a specified X coordinate. Similarly, if the bottom X axis or the top X axis  is
              moved,  it  remains  horizontal,  but  intersects  the  left  edge  of  the  grid at a specified Y
              coordinate.

              No axis may be moved outside the current graph window; if an attempt is made to do so, the axis is
              moved as far as the edge and no farther.

       ´[AXIS/]s/INTERSECTION/GRID.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/IN/GR.´

              A real number which, if not equal to the current "null  1",  specifies,  in  the  grid  coordinate
              system,  the  X  coordinate (if "s" = "LEFT" or "RIGHT") or the Y coordinate (if "s" = "BOTTOM" or
              "TOP") of the point of intersection of the axis specified by "s" with the perpendicular  sides  of
              the grid window.

              Default value: "1.E36" ("null 1") for all "s" (axes lie on the edges of the grid window).

       ´[AXIS/]s/INTERSECTION/USER.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/IN/US.´

              A  real  number  which,  if  not  equal to the current "null 1", specifies, in the user coordinate
              system, the X coordinate (if "s" = "LEFT" or "RIGHT") or the Y coordinate (if "s"  =  "BOTTOM"  or
              "TOP")  of  the point of intersection of the axis specified by "s" with the perpendicular sides of
              the grid window.

              Default value: "1.E36" ("null 1") for all "s" (axes lie on the edges of the grid window).

       ´[AXIS/]s/FUNCTION.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/FU.´

              A real number, passed as an argument to the subroutine AGUTOL; this subroutine defines  the  user-
              system-to-label-system  mappings,  and  thus  the  label coordinate systems, for all the axes. The
              default version of AGUTOL defines the identity mapping  for  all  axes;  a  user  version  may  be
              substituted  to define any desired set of mappings. It is intended that ´AXIS/s/FUNCTION.´ be used
              within a user version of AGUTOL as a function selector. It is further recommended that  the  value
              "0." select the identity mapping, thus providing a way to re-create the default situation.

              Tick  marks  on  the  axis specified by "s" are positioned in the label coordinate system. Numeric
              labels on the axis give values in the label coordinate system.

              See the AGUTOL man page.

              Default value: "0." for all "s" (identity mapping for all axes).

       ´[AXIS/]s/TICKS.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/TI.´

              A group of ten parameters describing the tick marks, if any, which are to be a part  of  the  axis
              specified by "s".  Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR.´ (6)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MINOR.´ (4)

       ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/MA.´

              A  group  of six parameters describing the major tick marks, if any, which are to be a part of the
              axis specified by "s". Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/SPACING.´ (3)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/PATTERN.´ (1)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/LENGTH.´ (2)

       ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/SPACING.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/MA/SP.´

              A group of three parameters describing the way in which major tick marks, if any, are to be spaced
              along the axis specified by "s". Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/[SPACING/]TYPE.´  (1)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/[SPACING/]BASE.´  (1)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/[SPACING/]COUNT.´ (1)

       ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/[SPACING/]TYPE.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/MA/TY.´

              A real number specifying where major tick marks are to be placed along the axis specified  by  "s"
              (that is to say, at what values in the label coordinate system along that axis). Let "b" represent
              the  value  of  the parameter ´.../BASE.´ (described next) and "k" represent an arbitrary integer.
              Then, there are six acceptable values of ´.../TYPE.´:

              •      The value "0." specifies that no major tick marks are to be drawn on the axis.

              •      The value "1." specifies major tick marks at values of the form plus or minus b times k.

              •      The value "2." specifies major tick marks at values of the form plus or minus b times 10 to
                     the power k.

              •      The value "3." specifies major tick marks at values of the form plus  or  minus  b  to  the
                     power k.

              •      The  value  "null  1"  specifies  that  Autograph  should use a value "1.", "2.", or "3." -
                     whichever it considers best.

              •      The value "null 2" specifies that Autograph should use  a  value  "1.",  "2.",  or  "3."  -
                     whichever it considers best - and replace the "null 2" by that value.

              Notice  that  major  tick marks on a linear axis may be spaced logarithmically and that major tick
              marks on a logarithmic axis may be spaced linearly; this is sometimes useful.

              Default value: "1.E36" ("null 1") for all "s" (Autograph spaces major tick marks as it sees fit).

       ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/[SPACING/]BASE.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/MA/BA.´

              A real number which, if greater than zero and non-null, specifies the  base  value  ("b",  in  the
              preceding  parameter  description) used in spacing major tick marks in the label coordinate system
              along the axis specified by "s". A negative or zero value suppresses major tick marks on the axis.
              A null value causes Autograph to pick an appropriate base value and, if the null was a  "null  2",
              to backstore that value in place of the "null 2".

              Default value: "1.E36" ("null 1") for all "s" (Autograph picks the base values).

       ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/[SPACING/]COUNT.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/MA/CO.´

              A  real  number,  having  an  integral  value  "n" greater than or equal to 0. A negative value is
              treated as if it were a zero. The value n is only used when major tick  marks  are  to  be  spaced
              linearly  and  the  base  value  ("b", in the preceding parameter descriptions) is to be chosen by
              Autograph. In this case, n is a rough estimate of the minimum number of major  tick  marks  to  be
              placed  on  the  axis specified by "s". The actual number used may vary between "n+2" and "5n/2+4"
              (approximately).

              Default value: "6." for all "s" (somewhere between 8 and 19 major tick marks per linear axis).

       ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/PATTERN.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/MA/PA.´

              A real number specifying the dashed-line pattern to be used for  major  tick  marks  on  the  axis
              specified  by "s".  Normally, its integer equivalent is a 16-bit integer in which "0" bits specify
              "pen-up" segments (gaps) 3 plotter units long and "1" bits specify "pen-down" segments (solids)  3
              plotter  units long. The value "0." turns off the major tick marks, the value "65535." (decimal) =
              "177777."  (octal) makes them solid lines. If the value "null 1" is used, the next call to  AGSTUP
              resets it to "65535."  (decimal).

              Default value: "1.E36" ("null 1") for all "s" (solid-line patterns).

       ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/LENGTH.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/MA/LE.´

              A  group  of  two  parameters  determining  the length of the outward-pointing and inward-pointing
              portions of the major tick marks on the axis  specified  by  "s".  Subgroups  and  the  number  of
              parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/[LENGTH/]OUTWARD.´ (1)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/[LENGTH/]INWARD.´  (1)

       ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/[LENGTH/]OUTWARD.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/MA/OU.´

              A real number specifying the length of the outward-pointing portion of each major tick mark on the
              axis  specified  by  "s". The value must be of the form "e", "1.+e", or "-e", where "e" is greater
              than or equal to "0." and less than "1." and represents a fraction of the smaller dimension of the
              grid window.

              Note:  "Outward" is defined relative to the normal position of the axis "s", even when  that  axis
              has been moved away from its normal position.

              •      When a value "e" is used, each major tick mark extends outward "e" units from the axis.

              •      When  a  value  "1.+e" is used, each major tick mark extends outward to the farther edge of
                     the grid window and then "e" units beyond that edge. (If the axis is not  moved  away  from
                     its normal position, "1.+e" has the same effect as "e".)

              •      When a value "-e" is used, the first "e" units of the inward-pointing portion of each major
                     tick mark are erased.  (This can be used to create off-axis major tick marks - for whatever
                     that may be worth.)

              Default value: "0." for all "s" (all major ticks point inward).

       ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/[LENGTH/]INWARD.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/MA/IN.´

              A  real  number specifying the length of the inward-pointing portion of each tick mark on the axis
              specified by "s". The value must be of the form "e", "1.+e", or "-e", where e is greater  than  or
              equal  to  "0."  and less than "1." and represents a fraction of the smaller dimension of the grid
              window.

              Note:  "Inward" is defined relative to the normal position of the axis "s", even  when  that  axis
              has been moved away from its normal position.

              •      When a value "e" is used, each major tick mark extends inward "e" units from the axis.

              •      When a value "1.+e" is used, each major tick mark extends inward to the farther edge of the
                     grid  window  and  then  "e"  units  beyond  that edge. This feature is used to create grid
                     backgrounds.

              •      When a value "-e" is used, the first "e" units of  the  outward-pointing  portion  of  each
                     major tick mark are erased.

              Default value: ".015" for all "s" (all major ticks point inward).

       ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MINOR.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/MI.´

              A  group of four parameters describing the minor tick marks, if any, which are to be a part of the
              axis specified by "s". Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MINOR/SPACING.´ (1)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MINOR/PATTERN.´ (1)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MINOR/LENGTH.´  (2)

       ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MINOR/SPACING.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/MI/SP.´

              A real number specifying the desired number of minor tick marks to  be  distributed  between  each
              pair of major tick marks on the axis specified by "s". Acceptable values are as follows:

                 •      A value less than "1." suppresses minor tick marks completely.

                 •      A value greater than or equal to "1." which is non-null should be integral; it specifies
                        the number of minor tick marks directly.

                 •      The  values  "null  1"  and  "null  2"  specify that Autograph is to choose a reasonable
                        integral value; if a "null 2" is specified, it is replaced by the integral value chosen.

              The minor tick marks, if any, are spaced linearly in the label coordinate system  along  the  axis
              specified by "s".  Note that the appropriate value for the usual sort of logarithmic axis is "8.";
              this  causes  the  minor  tick marks between two major tick marks at label-system values 10**n and
              10**n+1 to be placed at the label-system values 2*10**n, 3*10**n, 4*10**n, . . ., 9*10**n.

              Default value: "1.E36" ("null 1") for all "s" (Autograph chooses appropriate values).

       ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MINOR/PATTERN.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/MI/PA.´

              A real number specifying the dashed-line pattern to be used for  minor  tick  marks  on  the  axis
              specified by "s"; analogous to ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/PATTERN.´, described above.

              Default value: "1.E36" ("null 1") for all "s" (solid-line patterns).

       ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MINOR/LENGTH.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/MI/LE.´

              A  group  of  two  parameters  determining  the length of the outward-pointing and inward-pointing
              portions of the minor tick marks on the axis  specified  by  "s".  Subgroups  and  the  number  of
              parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MINOR/[LENGTH/]OUTWARD.´ (1)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MINOR/[LENGTH/]INWARD.´  (1)

       ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MINOR/[LENGTH/]OUTWARD.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/MI/OU.´

              A real number specifying the length of the outward-pointing portion of each minor tick mark on the
              axis specified by "s"; analogous to ´...MAJOR/[LENGTH/]OUTWARD.´, described above.

              Default value: "0." for all "s" (all minor ticks point inward).

       ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MINOR/[LENGTH/]INWARD.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/MI/IN.´

              A  real number specifying the length of the inward-pointing portion of each minor tick mark on the
              axis specified by "s"; analogous to ´...MAJOR/[LENGTH/]INWARD.´, described above.

              Default value: ".010" for all "s" (all minor ticks point inward).

       ´[AXIS/]s/NUMERIC.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/NU.´

              A group of eight parameters describing the numeric labels, if any, which are to be a part  of  the
              axis specified by "s". Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]TYPE.´     (1)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]EXPONENT.´ (1)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]FRACTION.´ (1)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]ANGLE.´    (2)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]OFFSET.´   (1)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]WIDTH.´    (2)

       ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]TYPE.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/TY.´

              The three parameters

                 ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]TYPE.´
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]EXPONENT.´
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]FRACTION.´

              will  be  described together, because they are so closely interdependent. They specify the type of
              numeric labels to be used (at major-tick positions)  on  the  axis  specified  by  "s".  A  fourth
              parameter,

                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/[SPACING/]TYPE.´,

              described  above,  also affects the type of numeric labels to be used. I shall refer to these four
              parameters in the ensuing discussion using short forms of  their  names  (´s/  TYPE.´,  ´s/EXPO.´,
              ´s/FRAC.´, and ´s/MAJOR/TYPE.´, respectively).

              All  four  have the default value "null 1" (except for the first, which has the default value "0."
              for "s" = "RIGHT" and "TOP"), leaving Autograph free to choose values which  are  consistent  with
              each other and with other parameters describing the axis specified by "s". Any one or more of them
              may  be  given the value "null 2" (in which case an actual value chosen by Autograph is backstored
              over the "null 2") or an actual integral real value.

              Setting ´s/TYPE.´ to "0.":

              This turns off the numeric labels on the axis specified by "s". The  other  three  parameters  are
              then ignored.

              Setting ´s/TYPE.´ to "1.":

              This selects "scientific" notation. Each numeric label is written in the form

                 [-] [i] [.] [f] x 10 e

              where  brackets  enclose  portions  which  may  be  independently  present  or absent and "e" is a
              superscript exponent.

              The parameter ´s/EXPO.´ specifies the  length  of  "i"  (the  number  of  characters),  thus  also
              specifying the value of the exponent "e". If ´s/EXPO.´ has a value less than or equal to zero, "i"
              is  omitted.  If ´s/EXPO.´ is less than zero and has the integral absolute value "n", the fraction
              "f" is forced to have "n" leading zeroes.

              The parameter ´s/FRAC.´ specifies the length of "f" (the number of characters).  If  ´s/FRAC.´  is
              less  than  or equal to zero, "f" is omitted. If ´s/FRAC.´ is less than zero, the decimal point is
              omitted.

              If "[i] [.] [f]" has the value "1.", the first part of the label is omitted, leaving only "10 e".

              If the entire label has the value "0.", the single character "0" is used.

              The value of ´s/MAJOR/TYPE.´ is immaterial.

              Setting ´s/TYPE.´ to "2.":

              This selects  "exponential"  notation,  the  exact  nature  of  which  depends  on  the  value  of
              ´s/MAJOR/TYPE.´, as follows:

              •      If  ´s/MAJOR/TYPE.´ has the value "1." (all major ticks at values of the form plus or minus
                     b times k), each numeric label is written in the form

                                  [-] [i] [.] [f] x 10 e

                     where brackets enclose portions which may be independently present or absent and "e"  is  a
                     superscript exponent.

                     The parameter ´s/EXPO.´ specifies the integral value of the exponent "e".

                     The  parameter  ´s/FRAC.´  specifies  the  length  of  "f"  (the  number of characters). If
                     ´s/FRAC.´ is less than or equal to zero, f is omitted. If ´s/FRAC.´ is less than zero,  the
                     decimal point is omitted.

                     If the label value is exactly zero, the single character "0" is used.

              •      If  ´s/MAJOR/TYPE.´ has the value "2." (all major ticks at values of the form plus or minus
                     b times 10 to the power k), each numeric label is written in the form

                                  [-] [i] [.] [f] x 10 e

                     where brackets enclose portions which may be independently present or absent and "e"  is  a
                     superscript exponent.

                     The  parameter  ´s/EXPO.´  specifies the integral value of the exponent "e" when "k" equals
                     "0." The value of "e" is ´s/EXPO.´ plus "k".

                     The parameter ´s/FRAC.´ specifies  the  length  of  "f"  (the  number  of  characters).  If
                     ´s/FRAC.´  is  less  than or equal to zero, "f" is omitted. If ´s/FRAC.´ is less than zero,
                     the decimal point is omitted.

                     If the label value is exactly zero, the single character "0" is used.

              •      If ´s/MAJOR/TYPE.´ has the value "3." (all major ticks at values of the form plus or  minus
                     b to the power k), each numeric label is written in the form

                                  [-] [i] [.] [f] e

                     where  brackets  enclose portions which may be independently present or absent and "e" is a
                     superscript exponent.

                     The parameter ´s/EXPO.´ is ignored. The value of "e" is "k".

                     The parameter ´s/FRAC.´ specifies  the  length  of  "f"  (the  number  of  characters).  If
                     ´s/FRAC.´  is  less  than or equal to zero, "f" is omitted. If ´s/FRAC.´ is less than zero,
                     the decimal point is omitted.

                     Note that "[i] [.] [f]" expresses the value of "b".

              Setting ´s/TYPE.´ to "3.":

              This selects  "no-exponent"  notation,  the  exact  nature  of  which  depends  on  the  value  of
              ´s/MAJOR/TYPE.´, as follows:

              •      If  ´s/MAJOR/TYPE.´ has the value "1." (all major ticks at values of the form plus or minus
                     b times k), each numeric label is written in the form

                                  [-] [i] [.] [f]

                     where brackets enclose portions which may be independently present or absent.

                     The parameter ´s/EXPO.´ is ignored.

                     The parameter ´s/FRAC.´ specifies  the  length  of  "f"  (the  number  of  characters).  If
                     ´s/FRAC.´  is  less  than or equal to zero, "f" is omitted. If ´s/FRAC.´ is less than zero,
                     the decimal point is omitted.

                     If the label value is exactly zero, the single character "0" is used.

              •      If ´s/MAJOR/TYPE.´ has the value "2." (all major ticks at values of the form plus or  minus
                     b times 10 to the power k), each numeric label is written in the form

                                  [-] [i] [.] [f]

                     where brackets enclose portions which may be independently present or absent.

                     The parameter ´s/EXPO.´ is ignored.

                     The length of "f" (the number of characters) is specified by the function

                                  MAX(´s/FRAC.´,0) - k

                     if this quantity is greater than zero, and

                                  MIN(´s/FRAC.´,0)

                     otherwise. This may appear somewhat formidable, but it produces a simple, desirable result.
                     Suppose, for example, that ´s/FRAC.´ = "1.", "b" = "3.6", and "k" ranges from "-3" to "+3";
                     the labels produced are

                         .0036, .036, .36, 3.6, 36., 360., and 3600.

                     The  parameter ´s/FRAC.´ may be viewed as specifying the length of "f" when "k" is zero. If
                     the function value is less than or equal to zero, "f" is omitted; if it is less than  zero,
                     the decimal point is omitted.

              •      If  ´s/MAJOR/TYPE.´ has the value "3." (all major ticks at values of the form plus or minus
                     b to the power k), each numeric label is written in the form

                                  [-] [i] [.] [f]

                     if "k" is greater than or equal to zero, and in the form

                                  [-] 1/ [i] [.] [f]

                     if "k" is less than zero. Brackets enclose portions which may be independently  present  or
                     absent.

                     The parameter ´s/EXPO.´ is ignored.

                     The length of "f" (the number of characters) is specified by the function

                                  ´s/FRAC.´ * ABS(k)

                     if "k" is non-zero, or

                                  MIN(´s/FRAC.´,0)

                     if  "k"  is  zero.  Again, this function produces a simple result. Suppose that ´s/FRAC.´ =
                     "1.", "b" = "1.1", and "k" ranges from "-3" to "+3"; the labels produced are

                         1/1.331, 1/1.21, 1/1.1, 1., 1.1, 1.21, and 1.331

                     The parameter ´s/FRAC.´ may be viewed as specifying the length of "f" when "k" is equal  to
                     1.  If the function value is less than or equal to zero, "f" is omitted; if it is less than
                     zero, the decimal point is omitted.

                     Another example: Suppose ´s/FRAC.´ = "-1.", "b" = "2.", and "k" ranges from "-4"  to  "+4";
                     the labels produced are

                         1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16

                     Default  value:  "1.E36"  ("null 1") for all three for all "s" (Autograph chooses values to
                     use), except for

                               ´RIGHT/[NUMERIC/]TYPE.´ and
                               ´TOP/[NUMERIC/]TYPE.´,

                     which are zeroed to suppress the numeric labels on the right and top axes.

       ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]EXPONENT.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/EX.´

              See the discussion of ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]TYPE.´, above.

       ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]FRACTION.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/FR.´

              See the discussion of ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]TYPE.´, above.

       ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]ANGLE.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/AN.´

              A group of two integral real numbers specifying the orientation angle of  numeric  labels  on  the
              axis specified by "s". Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]ANGLE/1ST.´ (1)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]ANGLE/2ND.´ (1)

       ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]ANGLE/1ST.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/AN/1S.´

              An  integral  real number having one of the values "0.", "90.", "180.", or "270." (plus or minus a
              small multiple of "360."), specifying the user´s first choice for the orientation angle of numeric
              labels on the axis specified by "s". The value is stated in degrees counter-clockwise from a left-
              to-right horizontal vector.

              The routine AGSTUP decides whether the first choice or the second choice is to be used. The second
              choice is used only when the first choice leads to overlap  problems  and  the  current  value  of
              ´[AXIS/]s/CONTROL.´ is a "3." or a "4."  and the second choice works out better than the first. If
              AGSTUP  decides  to  use  the  first  choice, it leaves the first-choice parameter with a positive
              value; if it decides to use the second  choice,  it  leaves  the  first-choice  parameter  with  a
              negative  value.  Values  are  made  positive  or  negative by adding and subtracting multiples of
              "360.".

              Default value: "0." for all "s" (horizontal labels preferred on all axes).

       ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]ANGLE/2ND.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/AN/2N.´

              An integral real number having one of the values "0.", "90.", "180.", or "270." (plus or  minus  a
              small  multiple  of  "360."),  specifying  the  user´s  second choice for the orientation angle of
              numeric labels on the axis specified by "s". The value is stated in degrees counter-clockwise from
              a left-to-right horizontal vector. See the description of the preceding parameter.

              Default value: "90." for all "s" (vertical labels, readable from the right, on all axes).

       ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]OFFSET.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/OF.´

              A real number specifying the desired position of numeric labels relative to the axis specified  by
              "s".

              If  the  value is positive, numeric labels are to be placed toward the outside of the grid. If the
              value is negative, numeric labels are to be placed toward the inside of the  grid.  In  either  of
              these  two  cases,  the magnitude of the value specifies the distance from the line portion of the
              axis to the nearest part of any numeric label, stated as a fraction of the  smaller  dimension  of
              the grid window.  Note:  "Inside" and "outside" are defined relative to the normal position of the
              axis "s", even when that axis has been moved away from its normal position.

              If  the  value is exactly zero, each numeric label is centered on the axis. In this case, the line
              portion of the axis is suppressed and major and minor tick marks are moved outward so  as  not  to
              overlap the numeric labels.

              Default value: ".015" for all "s" (all labels outside the grid).

       ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]WIDTH.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/WI.´

              A group of two real parameters specifying the widths of characters to be used in numeric labels on
              the axis specified by "s". Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]WIDTH/MANTISSA.´ (1)
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]WIDTH/EXPONENT.´ (1)

       ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]WIDTH/MANTISSA.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/WI/MA.´

              A  real  number  specifying  the  width of characters to be used in the "mantissa" of each numeric
              label on the axis specified by "s", expressed as a fraction of the smaller dimension of  the  grid
              window.

              Default value: ".015" for all "s".

       ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]WIDTH/EXPONENT.´
              Simplest form of name: ´s/WI/EX.´

              A  real number specifying the width of characters to be used in the exponent of each numeric label
              on the axis specified by "s", expressed as a fraction of the smaller dimension of the grid window.

              Default value: ".010" for all "s".

       ´DASH.´
              Simplest form of name: ´DAS.´

              A group of thirty parameters, the first of which determines what dashed-line patterns  are  to  be
              used  by  the routines EZMY and EZMXY and the rest of which describe the "user" set of dashed-line
              patterns (as opposed to the "alphabetic" set, which is defined by code in  the  subroutine  AGCURV
              and  is  not subject to change by the user). Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as
              follows:

                 ´DASH/SELECTOR.´     (1)
                 ´DASH/LENGTH.´       (1)
                 ´DASH/CHARACTER.´    (1)
                 ´DASH/DOLLAR-QUOTE.´ (1)
                 ´DASH/PATTERNS.´    (26)

       ´DASH/SELECTOR.´
              Simplest form of name: ´DAS/SE.´

              The parameter ´DASH/SELECTOR.´ is given a negative integral value to  specify  that  the  routines
              EZMY and EZMXY should use the "alphabetic" set of 26 dashed-line patterns for the curves they draw
              and a positive integral value "n", less than or equal to 26, to specify that EZMY and EZMXY should
              use  the  first  "n" patterns in the "user" set of dashed-line patterns, as defined by the current
              values of the remaining parameters in the group ´DASH.´.

              Each of the patterns in the "alphabetic" set specifies a solid line interrupted periodically by  a
              letter  of  the  alphabet.  Each  of the patterns in the "user" set is as defined by the user. The
              default "user" set produces all solid lines.

              The routines EZY and EZXY, which draw but one curve per call, always use the first of the patterns
              in the "user" set; they are unaffected by the value of ´DASH/SELECTOR.´.

              The selected pattern set is used in a circular fashion. For example, if ´DASH/SELECTOR.´  has  the
              value "3." and EZMY is used to draw nine curves, pattern 1 is used for curves 1, 4, and 7, pattern
              2 for curves 2, 5, and 8, and pattern 3 for curves 3, 6, and 9.

              Default value: "+1." (The first element of the "user" set of dashed-line patterns is to be used by
              EZMY and EZMXY.)

       ´DASH/LENGTH.´
              Simplest form of name: ´DAS/LE.´

              An  integral real number specifying how long character-string dashed-line patterns are expected to
              be. In a user call to ANOTAT with a positive fifth argument (implying that the sixth  argument  is
              an  array  of  character-string  dashed-line  patterns)  or  in  a  user  call  to  AGSETC setting
              ´DASH/PATTERN/n.´ (in which case the second argument is such a pattern), the  specified  character
              strings must be of the length specified by the current value of ´DASH/LENGTH.´.

              Default value: "8." (dashed-line patterns are expected to be eight characters long).

       ´DASH/CHARACTER.´
              Simplest form of name: ´DAS/CH.´

              A  real  number specifying the width of each character (other than a dollar sign or a quote) which
              is drawn along a curve as directed by a character-string dashed-line  pattern  (whether  from  the
              "alphabetic"  set  or  from the "user" set).  This width is expressed as a fraction of the smaller
              dimension of the grid window.

              Default value: ".010"

       ´DASH/DOLLAR-QUOTE.´
              Simplest form of name: ´DAS/DO.´

              A real number specifying the line length corresponding to a dollar sign (solid) or a  quote  (gap)
              in a character-string dashed-line pattern, expressed as a fraction of the smaller dimension of the
              grid window.

              Default value: ".010"

       ´DASH/PATTERNS.´
              Simplest form of name: ´DAS/PA.´

              A group of 26 parameters defining the "user" set of dashed-line patterns. Subgroups and the number
              of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´DASH/PATTERNS/1.´  (1)
                 ´DASH/PATTERNS/2.´  (1)
                  .
                  .
                  .
                 ´DASH/PATTERNS/26.´ (1)

       ´DASH/PATTERNS/n.´
              Simplest form of name: ´DAS/PA/n.´

              (The  symbol  "n"  represents an integer between "1" and "26", inclusive.) An integral real number
              defining the "n"th dashed-line pattern in the "user" set.

              If the value is positive, it must be between "0." and "65535.", inclusive, and is interpreted as a
              16-bit binary pattern in which each "0" bit specifies a "pen-up" gap segment 3 plotter units  long
              and  each "1" bit specifies a "pen-down" solid segment 3 plotter units long. Such a pattern may be
              defined by a user call to AGSETF, AGSETI, or AGSETR.

              If the value is negative, it serves as an identifier, allowing Autograph  to  retrieve,  from  its
              character  storage  space,  a character string in which each single quote specifies a "pen-up" gap
              segment, each dollar sign specifies a "pen-down" solid segment, and each other character is simply
              to be drawn as a part of the line. Such a pattern may be defined by a user call to AGSETC.

              Note that the function "AGDSHN" allows a user to easily  generate  the  name  of  the  "n"th  dash
              pattern.

              Default values: "65535." for all "n" (solid lines).

       ´LABEL.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB.´

              A  group  of  3+10n  parameters,  where  "n" is the current value of ´LABEL/BUFFER/LENGTH.´ (8, by
              default) describing up to "n" informational labels. These labels are  a  part  of  the  background
              drawn  by  a  call  to  the  routine AGBACK. Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as
              follows:

                 ´LABEL/CONTROL.´            (1)
                 ´LABEL/BUFFER/LENGTH.´      (1)
                 ´LABEL/BUFFER/CONTENTS.´  (10n)
                 ´LABEL/NAME.´               (1)

       ´LABEL/CONTROL.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/CO.´

              An integral real number having the value "0.", "1.", or "2.". Values greater than "2." are changed
              to a "2." by the next AGSTUP call. Values less than "0." are changed to a "0." by the next  AGSTUP
              call; negative values have a special use, however (see below).

              •      The value "0." disables the drawing of informational labels. They remain defined, however.

              •      The  value "1." enables the drawing of informational labels and specifies that they may not
                     be shrunk in response to overlap problems.

              •      The value "2." enables the drawing of informational labels and specifies that they  may  be
                     shrunk in response to overlap problems.

              Default value: "2." (labels enabled, shrinkable).

              Special  action  by AGSETP: An AGSETP call which sets this parameter (individually, rather than as
              part of a group) to a negative value results in the deletion of all currently defined labels. Note
              that the negative value is changed to a zero by  the  next  AGSTUP  call;  thus,  the  drawing  of
              informational labels is disabled until re-enabled by the user.

       ´LABEL/BUFFER.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/BU.´

              A  group  of  1+10n  parameters,  where  "n" is the current value of ´LABEL/BUFFER/LENGTH.´ (8, by
              default). Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´LABEL/BUFFER/LENGTH.´     (1)
                 ´LABEL/BUFFER/CONTENTS.´ (10n)

       ´LABEL/BUFFER/LENGTH.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/BU/LE.´

              An integral real number specifying the number of 10-word label definitions the label  buffer  will
              hold.  A  user  program may need to retrieve, but must not set, the value of this parameter, since
              its value must match the second dimension of the label buffer.

              Increasing the size of the label buffer requires modifying the Autograph source code.

              Default value: "8.".

       ´LABEL/BUFFER/CONTENTS.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/BU/CO.´

              This parameter group may be thought of as an array FLLB, dimensioned 10 x n, containing  up  to  n
              10-word label definitions. For a second subscript j,

              •      FLLB(1,j)  is either a real "0.", saying that no label is defined by this 10-word block, or
                     it is non-zero, in which case it identifies a character string  in  Autograph´s  character-
                     string  storage  area;  the character string serves as a name for the label defined by this
                     10-word block. When FLLB(1,j) is non-zero:

              •      FLLB(2,j) is either a "0.", to enable drawing of the label, or a "1.", to  disable  drawing
                     of the label,

              •      FLLB(3,j) and FLLB(4,j) are the X and Y coordinates of the label´s "basepoint", in the grid
                     coordinate system,

              •      FLLB(5,j)  and  FLLB(6,j) are the X and Y components of the label´s "offset vector", stated
                     as signed fractions of the smaller dimension of the grid window,

              •      FLLB(7,j) is an integral real number "0.", "90.", "180.", or "270.", specifying  the  angle
                     at which the label´s "baseline" emanates from the end of its offset vector,

              •      FLLB(8,j)  is  an  integral  real  number  specifying  how the lines of the label are to be
                     positioned relative to the end of the offset vector ("-1." to line up the left  ends,  "0."
                     to line up the centers, or "+1." to line up the right ends),

              •      FLLB(9,j) is an integral real count of the number of lines belonging to the label, and

              •      FLLB(10,j) is an integral real pointer specifying the second subscript (in the line buffer)
                     of  the  first  line of the label (the one having the largest line number), or, if no lines
                     belong to the label, a "0.".

              It is not recommended that a user program change the  contents  of  this  buffer  directly.  Label
              definitions   should  be  accessed  indirectly  by  means  of  the  parameters  ´LABEL/NAME.´  and
              ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]...´.

              Default values: The label buffer contains four pre-defined labels, corresponding to the four edges
              of the grid window.  They are as follows:

                   Label name:          ´L´     ´R´     ´B´

                   Suppression flag:    0.      0.      0.

                   Basepoint X:         0.      1.      .5

                   Basepoint Y:         .5      .5      0.

                   Offset X:           -.015   +.015    0.

                   Offset Y:            0.      0.     -.015

                   Baseline angle:      90.     90.     0.

                   Centering option:    0.      0.      0.

                   Line count:          1.      1.      1.

                   First-line index:    1.      2.      3.

              The description of ´LINE/BUFFER/CONTENTS.´, below, gives the default values for the definitions of
              the lines which belong to these labels.

       ´LABEL/BUFFER/NAMES.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/BU/NA.´

              This group is a subset of the previous one. It provides a way  of  retrieving  the  names  of  all
              currently-defined labels.

       ´LABEL/NAME.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/NA.´

              An  integral  real  pointer which, if non-zero, specifies a particular label in the label buffer -
              the one which is to be referenced by the parameter group ´LABEL/DEFINITION.´ (which see, below).

              Setting ´LABEL/NAME.´ is the required first step in accessing a particular label definition.

              Default value: "0." (undefined).

              Special action by AGSETP: To access the definition of a particular  label,  one  must  first  call
              AGSETC  with ´LABEL/NAME.´ as the first argument and the name of the label one wishes to access as
              the second argument. This causes AGSETP (which is called by AGSETC) to search for  the  definition
              of  the  desired  label in the label buffer. If that definition is not found, a new one is made up
              and inserted in the label buffer. In either case,  ´LABEL/NAME.´  is  given  a  real  value  whose
              integer equivalent specifies the second subscript of the label definition in the label buffer.

              The  definition  of  a  new  label  has the name specified by the user, a suppression flag "0.", a
              basepoint (.5,.5), an offset vector (0.,0.), a baseline angle "0.", a  centering  option  "0.",  a
              line count "0.", and a first-line index "0.".

       ´LABEL/DEFINITION.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/DE.´

              A  set  of  nine parameters defining the label specified by the current value of ´LABEL/NAME.´. If
              ´LABEL/NAME.´ has the value "0.", referencing this group or a parameter  in  it  causes  an  error
              exit. Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]SUPPRESSION.´ (1)
                 ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]BASEPOINT.´   (2)
                 ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]OFFSET.´      (2)
                 ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]ANGLE.´       (1)
                 ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]CENTERING.´   (1)
                 ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]LINES.´       (1)
                 ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]INDEX.´       (1)

       ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]SUPPRESSION.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/SU.´

              An  integral real "suppression flag" having the value "0."  or "1." and specifying whether drawing
              of the label specified by ´LABEL/NAME.´ is enabled ("0.") or disabled ("1.").

              Default value for a new label: "0." (label enabled).

              Special action by AGSETP: If a user program attempts to set this parameter  (individually,  rather
              than  as  part  of a group) to a negative value, the lines of the label specified by ´LABEL/NAME.´
              are deleted and ´LINE/NUMBER.´ is zeroed. If the negative value is less than "-1.", the  label  is
              deleted as well and ´LABEL/NAME.´ is zeroed.  (Deleting a label means that its name cell is set to
              "0.".)

       ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]BASEPOINT.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/BA.´

              A set of two parameters specifying the X and Y coordinates of the basepoint of the label specified
              by  ´LABEL/NAME.´,  in  the  grid  coordinate  system.  The  label  is positioned relative to this
              basepoint. Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]BASEPOINT/X.´ (1)
                 ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]BASEPOINT/Y.´ (1)

       ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]BASEPOINT/X.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/BA/X.´

              The X coordinate of the basepoint of the label specified by ´LABEL/NAME.´. The value  "0."  refers
              to the left edge of the grid window, the value "1." to the right edge of the grid window.

              Default value for a new label: ".5" (centered).

       ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]BASEPOINT/Y.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/BA/Y.´

              The  Y  coordinate of the basepoint of the label specified by ´LABEL/NAME.´. The value "0." refers
              to the bottom edge of the grid window, the value "1." to the top edge of the grid window.

              Default value for a new label: ".5" (centered).

       ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]OFFSET.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/OF.´

              A set of two parameters specifying the X and Y components  of  the  offset  vector  of  the  label
              specified  by  ´LABEL/NAME.´, as signed fractions of the smaller dimension of the grid window. The
              offset vector has its basepoint at the label basepoint. Subgroups and the number of parameters  in
              each are as follows:

                 ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]OFFSET/X.´ (1)
                 ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]OFFSET/Y.´ (1)

       ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]OFFSET/X.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/OF/X.´

              The X component of the offset vector of the label specified by ´LABEL/NAME.´ - negative toward the
              left edge, positive toward the right edge, of the grid window. The magnitude represents a fraction
              of the smaller dimension of the grid window.

              Default value for a new label: "0." (zero-length vector).

       ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]OFFSET/Y.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/OF/Y.´

              The Y component of the offset vector of the label specified by ´LABEL/NAME.´ - negative toward the
              bottom edge, positive toward the top edge, of the grid window. The magnitude represents a fraction
              of the smaller dimension of the grid window.

              Default value for a new label: "0." (zero-length vector).

       ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]ANGLE.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/AN.´

              An  integral  real  number having one of the values "0.", "90.", "180.", or "270.", and specifying
              the direction in which the baseline of the label specified by ´LABEL/NAME.´ emanates from the  end
              of  its offset vector, measured counter-clockwise from a left-to-right horizontal vector.  All the
              lines of a label are written parallel to its baseline and in the direction of the baseline.

              Default value for a new label: "0." (horizontal, left to right).

       ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]CENTERING.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/CE.´

              An integral real number  specifying  the  alignment  of  the  lines  of  the  label  specified  by
              ´LABEL/NAME.´  with  the  end  of its offset vector. A negative value aligns the left ends, a zero
              value the centers, and a positive value the right ends, of the lines.

              Default value for a new label: "0." (centers aligned).

       ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]LINES.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/LI.´

              An integral real number specifying the number of lines in the label specified by ´LABEL/NAME.´.

              This parameter is updated by Autograph as lines are added to or deleted from the label and  should
              not be set by a user program.

              Default value for a new label: "0." (no lines).

       ´LABEL/[DEFINITION/]INDEX.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LAB/IN.´

              An  integral  real  number  specifying the second subscript (in the line buffer) of the first line
              belonging to the label specified by ´LABEL/NAME.´ - a zero if no line belongs to the label.

              This parameter is updated by Autograph as lines are added to or deleted from the label and  should
              not be set by a user program.

              Default value for a new label: "0." (no lines).

       ´LINE.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LIN.´

              A  group  of  4+6n  parameters,  where  "n"  is the current value of ´LINE/BUFFER/LENGTH.´ (16, by
              default) describing up to "n" lines, each  of  which  is  a  part  of  some  informational  label.
              Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´LINE/MAXIMUM.´          (1)
                 ´LINE/END.´              (1)
                 ´LINE/BUFFER/LENGTH.´    (1)
                 ´LINE/BUFFER/CONTENTS.´ (6n)
                 ´LINE/NUMBER.´           (1)

       ´LINE/MAXIMUM.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LIN/MA.´

              An  integral  real number specifying the assumed maximum length of a character string delivered to
              Autograph for use as the text of a label line. Such a character string  may  occur  as  the  first
              argument  of  a  call to ANOTAT (defining the text of line "100." in the label ´L´), as the second
              argument of a call to ANOTAT (defining the text of line "-100."  in the label ´B´),  as  the  last
              argument  of  a  call  to one of the routines EZY, EZXY, EZMY, or EZMXY (defining the text of line
              "100." in the label ´T´), or as the second argument of a call to AGSETC whose first argument is

                 ´LINE/[DEFINITION/]TEXT.´

              (defining the text of any line). In each of these cases, the  character  string  must  be  of  the
              length  specified  by ´LINE/MAXIMUM.´ or shorter. If it is shorter, its last character must be the
              character specified by ´LINE/END.´, described below.

              This parameter may be given any desired non-negative integral value.

              Default value: "40.".

       ´LINE/END.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LIN/EN.´

              A character string whose first character is the one used to mark the end  of  a  character  string
              defining  the  text of a label line (in calls to ANOTAT, EZY, EZXY, EZMY, EZMXY, and AGSETC), when
              that character string is shorter  than  the  current  maximum  specified  by  ´LINE/MAXIMUM.´  (as
              described above).

              The  terminator  character  does not become a part of the text of the line. It is stripped off, so
              that only the preceding characters constitute the text of the line.

              Default value: "´$´".

       ´LINE/BUFFER.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LIN/BU.´

              A group of 1+6n parameters, where "n" is  the  current  value  of  ´LINE/BUFFER/LENGTH.´  (16,  by
              default). Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´LINE/BUFFER/LENGTH.´    (1)
                 ´LINE/BUFFER/CONTENTS.´ (6n)

       ´LINE/BUFFER/LENGTH.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LIN/BU/LE.´

              An  integral  real  number  specifying  the number of 6-word line definitions the line buffer will
              hold. A user program may need to retrieve, but must not set, the value of  this  parameter,  since
              its value must match the second dimension of the line buffer.

              Increasing the size of the line buffer requires modifying the Autograph source code.

              Default value: "16.".

       ´LINE/BUFFER/CONTENTS.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LIN/BU/CO.´

              This  group  may be thought of as an array FLLN, dimensioned 6 x n, containing up to n 6-word line
              definitions. For a second subscript j,

              •      FLLN(1,j) is either a real "null 1", saying that no label line is defined  by  this  6-word
                     block, or an integral real "line number", saying that it does define a label line, in which
                     case:

              •      FLLN(2,j) is either "0.", to enable drawing of the line, or "1.", to disable drawing of the
                     line.

              •      FLLN(3,j)  is  the  real  width  of each character of the line, stated as a fraction of the
                     smaller dimension of the grid window.

              •      FLLN(4,j) is an integral real number serving as the  identifier  of  the  character  string
                     defining  the  text  of  the line and enabling it to be retrieved from Autograph´s internal
                     character storage space.

              •      FLLN(5,j) is an integral real count of the number of characters in the text of the line.

              •      FLLN(6,j) is an integral real number specifying the second subscript (in the  line  buffer)
                     of  the  next line of the label to which this line belongs (that one of the remaining lines
                     in the chain with the largest line number) or, if there is no next line, a "0.".

              It is not recommended that a user program change  the  contents  of  this  buffer  directly.  Line
              definitions  should  be  accessed  indirectly  by  means  of  the  parameters  ´LINE/NUMBER.´  and
              ´LINE/[DEFINITION/]...´.

              Default values: The line buffer contains four pre-defined lines, each of which belongs to  one  of
              the four pre-defined labels. They are as follows:

            Label name         ´L´     ´R´             ´B´     ´T´

            Line number        +100.   -100.           -100.   +100.

            Suppression flag   0.      0.              0.      0.

            Character width    .015    .015            .015    .020

            Text pointed to    ´Y´     ´ ´ (a blank)   ´X´     ´ ´ (a blank)

            Text length        1.      0.              1.      0.

            Next-line index    0.      0.              0.      0.

              The  description  of  ´LABEL/BUFFER/CONTENTS.´, above, gives default values for the definitions of
              the four labels which contain these lines.

       ´LINE/NUMBER.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LIN/NU.´

              An integral real pointer which, if non-zero, specifies a particular line in the line buffer -  the
              one which is to be referenced by the parameter group ´LINE/DEFINITION.´ (which see, below).

              Setting this parameter is the required first step in accessing a particular line definition.

              Default value: "0." (undefined).

              Special action by AGSETP: To access the definition of a particular line of a particular label, one
              must  ensure  that  ´LABEL/NAME.´  (which  see,  above)  is  set.  Then, one must call AGSETI with
              ´LINE/NUMBER.´ as the first argument and the number of the line one wishes to access as the second
              argument. This causes AGSETP (which is called by  AGSETI)  to  search  the  line  buffer  for  the
              definition  of  a  line belonging to the label specified by the current value of ´LABEL/NAME.´ and
              having the desired line number. If no such definition is found, a new one is made up, inserted  in
              the line buffer, and linked into the proper place in the chain of lines belonging to the label. In
              either case, ´LINE/NUMBER.´ is given an integral real value specifying the second subscript of the
              line definition in the line buffer.

              The  definition  of  a  new  line has the number specified by the user, a suppression flag "0.", a
              character width ".015", a pointer to the text string "´ ´ (a single blank)", and a text length  of
              "1.".

              Note:  The "line numbers" are used to identify the lines of a label and to specify their positions
              relative to each other and to the baseline of the label. Lines having positive  line  numbers  are
              drawn above the label baseline, lines having zero line numbers are drawn along the label baseline,
              and lines having negative line numbers are drawn below the label baseline. A line having a greater
              line  number  than  another line is drawn above that line. ("Above" and "below" are used here from
              the viewpoint of someone reading the label.)  The magnitudes of the line numbers in no way  affect
              inter-line spacing, which is determined by Autograph itself.

       ´LINE/DEFINITION.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LIN/DE.´

              A  group  of  five parameters defining the line specified by ´LINE/NUMBER.´. If ´LINE/NUMBER.´ has
              the value "0.", referencing a parameter in this group causes an error  exit.   Subgroups  and  the
              number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´LINE/[DEFINITION/]SUPPRESSION.´ (1)
                 ´LINE/[DEFINITION/]CHARACTER.´   (1)
                 ´LINE/[DEFINITION/]TEXT.´        (1)
                 ´LINE/[DEFINITION/]LENGTH.´      (1)
                 ´LINE/[DEFINITION/]INDEX.´       (1)

       ´LINE/[DEFINITION/]SUPPRESSION.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LIN/SU.´

              An  integral  real number having the value "0." or "1." and specifying whether drawing of the line
              specified by ´LINE/NUMBER.´ is enabled ("0.") or disabled ("1.").

              Default value for a new line: "0." (line enabled).

              Special action by AGSETP: If a user program attempts to set this parameter  (individually,  rather
              than  as  a  part of a group) to a negative value, the line specified by ´LINE/NUMBER.´ is deleted
              and ´LINE/NUMBER.´ is reset to "0.".  (Deleting a line means that it is unlinked from the chain of
              lines belonging to its label and that its number cell is set to "null 1".)

       ´LINE/[DEFINITION/]CHARACTER.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LIN/CH.´

              A real  number  specifying  the  desired  width  of  each  character  of  the  line  specified  by
              ´LINE/NUMBER.´, stated as a fraction of the smaller dimension of the grid window.

              Default value for a new line: ".015".

       ´LINE/[DEFINITION/]TEXT.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LIN/TE.´

              An integral real number serving as an identifier for a character string stored away in Autograph´s
              internal character storage space.

              Default value for a new line: "´ ´ (a single blank)".

              Special  action  by  AGSETP:  When this parameter is set by a call to AGSETC, the character string
              appearing as the second argument  of  AGSETC  is  stored  in  a  character  storage  array  inside
              Autograph, an identifier allowing for later retrieval of the string is generated, and the value of
              that  identifier  is stored (by AGSETP, which is called by AGSETC) as the parameter value. At that
              time, the length  of  the  string  is  determined  and  ´LINE/[DEFINITION/]LENGTH.´  is  set.  See
              ´LINE/MAXIMUM.´ and ´LINE/TERMINATOR.´, above.

       ´LINE/[DEFINITION/]LENGTH.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LIN/LE.´

              An  integral  real  count  of  the  number  of  characters  in  the  text of the line specified by
              ´LINE/NUMBER.´. Setting this parameter less than or equal to zero suppresses the  drawing  of  the
              line. See also the description of ´LINE/[DEFINITION/]TEXT.´, above.

              Default value for a new line: "1." (one character - a blank).

       ´LINE/[DEFINITION/]INDEX.´
              Simplest form of name: ´LIN/IN.´

              An  integral  real number specifying the second subscript (in the line buffer) of the next line of
              the label - a zero if there is no next line.

              This parameter is updated by Autograph as lines are added to or deleted from the label and  should
              not be set by a user program.

       ´SECONDARY.´
              Simplest form of name: ´SEC.´

              A  group  of 149 "secondary" control parameters. These are not normally set by a user program, but
              are computed by Autograph itself (the routine  AGSTUP).  Their  values  may  be  of  use  in  some
              applications. Subgroups and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´SECONDARY/GRAPH.´      (4)
                 ´SECONDARY/USER.´       (4)
                 ´SECONDARY/CURVE.´      (4)
                 ´SECONDARY/DIMENSIONS.´ (3)
                 ´SECONDARY/AXIS.´      (80)
                 ´SECONDARY/LABEL.´     (54)

       ´SECONDARY/GRAPH.´
              Simplest form of name: ´SEC/GR.´

              A group of four real numbers specifying the X coordinates of the left and right edges of the graph
              window  and  the  Y  coordinates  of  the  bottom  and  top edges of the graph window, in the grid
              coordinate system. These values  are  used  by  Autograph  to  determine  whether  a  point  whose
              coordinates are expressed in the grid coordinate system lies inside or outside the graph window.

              If  the parameters in the group ´GRID.´ have their default values (".15", ".95", ".15", ".95", and
              "0."), these four parameters will be given the values "-.1875", "1.0625", "-.1875", and  "1.0625".
              Note that -.1875 = (0.-.15)/(.95-.15) and that 1.0625 = (1.-.15)/(.95-.15).

       ´SECONDARY/USER.´
              Simplest form of name: ´SEC/US.´

              A  set  of  four real numbers specifying the X coordinates of the left and right edges of the grid
              window and the Y coordinates of the bottom  and  top  edges  of  the  grid  window,  in  the  user
              coordinate  system.  These  values are used in mapping user curve points into the grid window. The
              routines AGSTUP, AGBACK, and AGCURV use these four numbers as arguments 5 through 8  in  calls  to
              the system-plot-package routine SET.

       ´SECONDARY/CURVE.´
              Simplest form of name: ´SEC/CU.´

              A  group of four real numbers specifying the X coordinates of the left and right edges of the grid
              (curve) window and the Y coordinates of the bottom and top edges of the grid (curve) window. The X
              coordinates are stated as fractions of the distance from left to right, and the Y  coordinates  as
              fractions  of  the distance from bottom to top, in the plotter frame. The routines AGSTUP, AGBACK,
              and AGCURV use these four numbers as arguments 1 through 4 in  calls  to  the  system-plot-package
              routine SET. If the parameters in the groups ´GRAPH.´ and ´GRID.´ have their default values, these
              four parameters are given the values ".15", ".95", ".15", and ".95".

       ´SECONDARY/DIMENSIONS.´
              Simplest form of name: ´SEC/DI.´

              A  group  of  three  real numbers, the first two of which specify the width and height of the grid
              window and the third of which is equal to the smaller of the first  two.   Each  is  stated  as  a
              number  of  plotter units. If the parameters in the groups ´GRAPH.´ and ´GRID.´ have their default
              values and the plotter being used has 1024x1024 addressable positions, then each  of  these  three
              parameters will be given the value 818.4 = (.95-.15) * 1023.

       ´SECONDARY/AXIS.´
              Simplest form of name: ´SEC/AX.´

              A  group  of  eighty  parameters having to do with the drawing of the four axes. Subgroups and the
              number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´SECONDARY/[AXIS/]LEFT.´   (20)
                 ´SECONDARY/[AXIS/]RIGHT.´  (20)
                 ´SECONDARY/[AXIS/]BOTTOM.´ (20)
                 ´SECONDARY/[AXIS/]TOP.´    (20)

              The parameters from the subgroups are interleaved in the group; that is to say, the first elements
              of the subgroups comprise elements 1 through 4 of the group, the second elements of the  subgroups
              comprise elements 5 through 8 of the group, and so on.

       ´SECONDARY/[AXIS/]s.´
              Simplest form of name: ´SEC/s.´

              A group of twenty parameters having to do with the drawing of the axis specified by "s", where "s"
              is one of the keywords "LEFT", "RIGHT", "BOTTOM", or "TOP". Subgroups and the number of parameters
              in each are as follows:

                 ´SECONDARY/[AXIS/]s/POSITION.´ (6)
                 ´SECONDARY/[AXIS/]s/TICKS.´    (3)
                 ´SECONDARY/[AXIS/]s/NUMERIC.´ (11)

       ´SECONDARY/[AXIS/]s/POSITION.´
              Simplest form of name: ´SEC/s/PO.´

              A  group  of  six real numbers, the first three of which describe a point at the beginning of axis
              "s" and the last three of which describe a point at the end of axis "s". The first two numbers  of
              each  triplet  are the X and Y coordinates of the point, in the grid coordinate system.  The third
              number of each triplet is a user-system X or Y coordinate (an X coordinate for a horizontal  axis,
              a Y coordinate for a vertical axis) of the point.

       ´SECONDARY/[AXIS/]s/TICKS.´
              Simplest form of name: ´SEC/s/TI.´

              A  group  of three real numbers, specifying the values Autograph has chosen to use for the primary
              parameters

                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/[SPACING/]TYPE.´
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MAJOR/[SPACING/]BASE.´
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[TICKS/]MINOR/SPACING.´

              (which see, above). These secondary parameters are used to hold the values Autograph  chooses  for
              the  corresponding  primary  parameters  so  as  not  to  disturb "null 1" values of those primary
              parameters.

       ´SECONDARY/[AXIS/]s/NUMERIC.´
              Simplest form of name: ´SEC/s/NU.´

              A group of eleven real numbers having to do with the generation of  numeric  labels  on  the  axis
              specified by "s".  The first three of these specify the values Autograph has chosen to use for the
              primary parameters

                 ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]TYPE.´
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]EXPONENT.´
                 ´[AXIS/]s/[NUMERIC/]FRACTION.´

              (which  see, above). The secondary parameters are used so as not to disturb "null 1" values of the
              primary parameters.

              The fourth parameter is an integral real count of the number of characters in the longest numeric-
              label mantissa on the axis "s".

              The fifth parameter is an integral real count of the number of characters in the longest  numeric-
              label exponent on the axis "s".

              The  sixth parameter is the necessary multiplicative "reduction factor" (between "0." and "1.") to
              be applied to the sizes of numeric labels on the axis "s"  in  order  to  make  them  fit  without
              overlap problems.

              The  seventh,  eighth,  ninth,  and  tenth parameters are real numbers specifying the width of the
              space required by numeric labels to the left (outward), to the right (inward),  at  the  beginning
              and  at  the end of the axis "s" - each is stated as a fraction of the width or height of the grid
              window, depending on the orientation of the axis "s".

              The eleventh parameter indicates the linear/log nature of the axis specified by "s".

       ´SECONDARY/LABEL.´
              Simplest form of name: ´SEC/LA.´

              A group of fifty-four parameters describing the six  "label  boxes",  each  of  which  provides  a
              mechanism for moving and/or shrinking a particular group of labels in attempting to keep any label
              in  that  group  from overlapping an axis or extending outside the current graph window. Subgroups
              and the number of parameters in each are as follows:

                 ´SECONDARY/LABEL/LEFT.´   (9)
                 ´SECONDARY/LABEL/RIGHT.´  (9)
                 ´SECONDARY/LABEL/BOTTOM.´ (9)
                 ´SECONDARY/LABEL/TOP.´    (9)
                 ´SECONDARY/LABEL/CENTER.´ (9)
                 ´SECONDARY/LABEL/GRAPH.´  (9)

              The parameters of the subgroups are interleaved in the group. The first elements of the  subgroups
              form  elements  1  through  6  of  the group, the second elements of the subgroups form elements 7
              through 12 of the group, and so on.

       ´SECONDARY/LABEL/b.´
              Simplest form of name: ´SEC/LA/b.´

              where the keyword "b" specifies the label box, as follows:

              •      If "b" = "LEFT", label box 1 is specified. It contains all labels having a basepoint on the
                     left edge of the grid window and a leftward-pointing offset vector. These labels are to  be
                     moved leftward as required to avoid overlapping any numeric labels on either Y axis.

              •      If  "b"  =  "RIGHT", label box 2 is specified. It contains all labels having a basepoint on
                     the right edge of the grid window and a rightward-pointing offset vector. These labels  are
                     to be moved rightward as required to avoid overlapping any numeric labels on either Y axis.

              •      If  "b"  = "BOTTOM", label box 3 is specified. It contains all labels having a basepoint on
                     the bottom edge of the grid window and a downward-pointing offset vector. These labels  are
                     to be moved downward as required to avoid overlapping any numeric labels on either X axis.

              •      If  "b" = "TOP", label box 4 is specified. It contains all labels having a basepoint on the
                     top edge of the grid window and an upward-pointing offset vector. These labels  are  to  be
                     moved upward as required to avoid overlapping any numeric labels on either X axis.

              •      If  "b"  = "CENTER", label box 5 is specified. It contains all labels having a basepoint on
                     some edge of the grid window and an inward-pointing offset vector. These labels are  to  be
                     moved inward as required to avoid overlapping numeric labels on any axis.

              •      If  "b"  =  "GRAPH",  label  box  6  is  specified. It contains all labels not specifically
                     assigned to one of the other boxes.  These labels are not moved, but may still be shrunk as
                     required to avoid their running outside the grid window.

              Prior to a call to AGSTUP, the nine parameters in this group are undefined.  Following  an  AGSTUP
              call,  but  preceding  an  AGBACK call, they have what I shall call "interim" values. Following an
              AGBACK call, they have what I shall call "final" values.

              The first parameter in the group is a "reduction factor" for  the  widths  of  characters  in  the
              labels in box "b". This parameter may have the interim value "0.", specifying that no actual value
              has yet been computed, or "1.", specifying that the user has prohibited shrinkage of labels in box
              "b"  (by  giving  ´LABEL/CONTROL.´ the value "1."). The final value of the reduction factor may be
              "-1.", specifying that minimum-sized labels were used, but even they led to overlap problems, or a
              value between "0." and "1.", specifying the actual reduction factor applied when the  labels  were
              drawn.

              The  next four parameters in the group specify the grid-system X coordinates of the left and right
              edges, and the grid-system Y coordinates of the bottom and  top  edges,  of  label  box  "b".  The
              interim  values specify the box in which the labels must be made to fit in order to avoid overlap,
              the final values the box in which the labels were actually made to fit.

              The last four parameters in the group specify the grid-system X coordinates of the left and  right
              edges,  and  the grid-system Y coordinates of the bottom and top edges, of the label box "b" which
              would result if all the labels were reduced to minimum size. The interim values specify an unmoved
              box, the final values a (possibly) moved box.
