</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       boolstuff - Disjunctive Normal Form boolean expression C++ library

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>g++</b> <b>prog.cpp</b> <b>-lboolstuff</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>boolstuff</b>  is  a  C++ library that contains an algorithm to convert a boolean expression binary tree into
       the Disjunctive Normal Form.  The NOT operator is supported.  A  C  API  covers  most  of  the  library's
       functionality.

       The  Disjunctive  Normal  Form  is  an  ORing of ANDed terms.  In other words, if the OR is considered an
       additive operation and the AND a multiplicative operation, then the DNF is a sum of products.

       For example, the DNF of the expression <b>a&amp;(b|c)</b> is <b>a&amp;b|a&amp;c</b>

       The DNF eliminates parentheses  and  provides  a  normalized  form  of  the  original  expression.   This
       normalized form is easier to execute.

       The  DNF  produced  by BoolStuff is devoid of any "useless" terms, which are always false (e.g., <b>x&amp;y&amp;!x</b>),
       but the terms that form the DNF  are  not  necessarily  simplified  (e.g.,  <b>x&amp;y&amp;x</b>).   When  executing  an
       expression  in DNF, it is recommended to obtain the list of terms and then to obtain the set of variables
       used in each term.  In the case of the term <b>x&amp;y&amp;x</b>, the set will only contain <b>x</b> once.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The library's source archive comes with an example program (in the 'examples' subdirectory) and with  two
       testing programs (in the src/boolstuff subdirectory).

       Comments are welcome.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Version  0.1.x  is  an  unstable  development  version.  The programming interface of the library and the
       command-line options of the accompanying commands are not necessarily fixed.  The documentation  has  not
       been reviewed for completeness.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       George Boole (1815-1864) is an English mathematician who helped establish modern symbolic logic and whose
       algebra of logic, now called Boolean algebra, is basic to the design of digital computer circuits.
