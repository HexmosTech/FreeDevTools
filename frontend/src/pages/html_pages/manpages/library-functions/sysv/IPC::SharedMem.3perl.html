</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       IPC::SharedMem - SysV Shared Memory IPC object class

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use IPC::SysV qw(IPC_PRIVATE S_IRUSR S_IWUSR);
           use IPC::SharedMem;

           $shm = IPC::SharedMem-&gt;new(IPC_PRIVATE, 8, S_IRWXU);

           $shm-&gt;write(pack("S", 4711), 2, 2);

           $data = $shm-&gt;read(0, 2);

           $ds = $shm-&gt;stat;

           $shm-&gt;remove;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A class providing an object based interface to SysV IPC shared memory.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new ( KEY , SIZE , FLAGS )
           Creates  a  new  shared  memory  segment of "SIZE" bytes size associated with "KEY". A new segment is
           created if

           •   "KEY" is equal to "IPC_PRIVATE"

           •   "KEY" does not already have a shared memory segment associated with it, and "<u>FLAGS</u>  &amp;  IPC_CREAT"
               is true.

           On creation of a new shared memory segment "FLAGS" is used to set the permissions.  Be careful not to
           set  any flags that the Sys V IPC implementation does not allow: in some systems setting execute bits
           makes the operations fail.

       id  Returns the shared memory identifier.

       read ( POS, SIZE )
           Read "SIZE" bytes from the shared memory segment at "POS". Returns the string  read,  or  "undef"  if
           there was an error. The return value becomes tainted. See shmread.

       write ( STRING, POS, SIZE )
           Write  "SIZE"  bytes  to  the shared memory segment at "POS". Returns true if successful, or false if
           there is an error. See shmwrite.

       remove
           Remove the shared memory segment from the system or mark it as removed as long as any  processes  are
           still attached to it.

       is_removed
           Returns true if the shared memory segment has been removed or marked for removal.

       stat
           Returns an object of type "IPC::SharedMem::stat" which is a sub-class of "Class::Struct". It provides
           the following fields. For a description of these fields see you system documentation.

               uid
               gid
               cuid
               cgid
               mode
               segsz
               lpid
               cpid
               nattch
               atime
               dtime
               ctime

       attach ( [FLAG] )
           Permanently  attach to the shared memory segment. When a "IPC::SharedMem" object is attached, it will
           use memread and memwrite instead of shmread and shmwrite for accessing  the  shared  memory  segment.
           Returns true if successful, or false on error. See <b><a href="../man2/shmat.2.html">shmat</a></b>(2).

       detach
           Detach  from  the  shared  memory  segment  that  previously  has  been  attached to. Returns true if
           successful, or false on error. See <b><a href="../man2/shmdt.2.html">shmdt</a></b>(2).

       addr
           Returns the address of the shared memory that has been attached to in a format suitable for use  with
           pack('P'). Returns "undef" if the shared memory has not been attached.
