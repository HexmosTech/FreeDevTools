</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CSS::Minifier::XS - XS based CSS minifier

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use CSS::Minifier::XS <a href="../manminify/qw.minify.html">qw</a>(minify);
         my $css      = '...';
         my $minified = minify($css);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "CSS::Minifier::XS" is a CSS "minifier"; its designed to remove unnecessary whitespace and comments from
       CSS files, while also <b>not</b> breaking the CSS.

       "CSS::Minifier::XS" is similar in function to "CSS::Minifier", but is substantially faster as its written
       in XS and not just pure Perl.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       minify($css)
           Minifies the given $css, returning the minified CSS back to the caller.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>IT</b> <b>WORKS</b></h4><pre>
       "CSS::Minifier::XS"  minifies  the  CSS  by  removing unnecessary whitespace from CSS documents.  Comment
       blocks are also removed, <u>except</u> when (a) they contain the word "copyright" in them, or (b) they're needed
       to implement the "Mac/IE Comment Hack".

       Internally, the minification is done by taking multiple passes through the CSS document:

   <b>Pass</b> <b>1:</b> <b>Tokenize</b>
       First, we go through and parse the CSS document into a  series  of  tokens  internally.   The  tokenizing
       process  <b>does</b>  <b>not</b> check to make sure that you've got syntactically valid CSS, it just breaks up the text
       into a stream of tokens suitable for processing by the subsequent stages.

   <b>Pass</b> <b>2:</b> <b>Collapse</b>
       We then march through the token list  and  collapse  certain  tokens  down  to  their  smallest  possible
       representation.   <u>If</u>  they're  still  included in the final results we only want to include them at their
       shortest.

       Whitespace
           Runs of multiple whitespace characters are reduced down to a single  whitespace  character.   If  the
           whitespace  contains  any  "end  of  line"  (EOL)  characters,  then  the end result is the <u>first</u> EOL
           character encountered.  Otherwise, the result is the first whitespace character in the run.

       Comments
           Comments implementing the "Mac/IE Comment Hack" are collapsed down to the smallest  possible  comment
           that would still implement the hack ("/*\*/" to start the hack, and "/**/" to end it).

       Zero Units
           Zero  Units  (e.g.  "0px")  are reduced down to just "0", as the CSS specification indicates that the
           unit is not required when its a zero value.

   <b>Pass</b> <b>3:</b> <b>Pruning</b>
       We then go back through the token list and prune and remove unnecessary tokens.

       Whitespace
           Wherever possible, whitespace is removed;  before+after  comment  blocks,  and  before+after  various
           symbols/sigils.

       Comments
           Comments  that  either (a) are needed to implement the "Mac/IE Comment Hack", or that (b) contain the
           word "copyright" in them are preserved.  <b>All</b> other comments are removed.

       Symbols/Sigils
           Semi-colons that are immediately followed by a closing brace (e.g. ";}") are removed; semi-colons are
           needed to separate multiple declarations, but aren't required at the end of a group.

       Everything else
           We keep everything else; identifiers, quoted literal strings, symbols/sigils, etc.

   <b>Pass</b> <b>4:</b> <b>Re-assembly</b>
       Lastly, we go back through the token list and re-assemble it all back into a single CSS string, which  is
       then returned back to the caller.
