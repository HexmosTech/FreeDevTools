       Tk::form - Geometry manager based on attachment rules

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>form</b>?(<u>args</u>)?

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>form</b><u>Option</u>?(<u>args</u>)?

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>form</b> method is used to communicate with the <b>form</b> Geometry Manager, a geometry manager that arranges
       the geometry of the children in a parent window according to attachment rules. The <b>form</b> geometry manager
       is very flexible and powerful; it can be used to emulate all the existing features of the Tk packer and
       placer geometry managers (see pack, place).  The <b>form</b> method can have any of several forms, depending on
       <u>Option</u>:

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>form</b>?(<u>options</u>)?
           Sets  or  adjusts  the attachment values of the slave window according to the <u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u> argument
           pairs.

           <b>-b</b> =&gt; <u>attachment</u>
                   Abbreviation for the <b>-bottom</b> option.

           <b>-bottom</b> =&gt; <u>attachment</u>
                   Specifies an attachment for the  bottom  edge  of  the  slave  window.  The  attachment  must
                   specified according to "SPECIFYING ATTACHMENTS" below.

           <b>-bottomspring</b> =&gt; <u>weight</u>
                   Specifies  the  weight  of  the  spring  at  the  bottom edge of the slave window. See "USING
                   SPRINGS" below.

           <b>-bp</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Abbreviation for the <b>-padbottom</b> option.

           <b>-bs</b> =&gt; <u>weight</u>
                   Abbreviation for the <b>-bottomspring</b> option.

           <b>-fill</b> =&gt; <u>style</u>
                   Specifies the fillings when springs are used for this widget. The value must be <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, <b>both</b> or
                   <b>none</b>.

           <b>-in</b> =&gt; <u>$master</u>
                   Places the slave window into the specified <u>$master</u> window. If the  slave  was  originally  in
                   another  master  window, all attachment values with respect to the original master window are
                   discarded. Even if the attachment values are the same as in the original master window,  they
                   need  to  be  specified  again.   The <b>-in</b> flag, when needed, must appear as the first flag of
                   <u>options</u>. Otherwise an error is generated.

           <b>-l</b> =&gt; <u>attachment</u>
                   Abbreviation for the <b>-left</b> option.

           <b>-left</b> =&gt; <u>attachment</u>
                   Specifies an attachment for the left edge of the slave window. The attachment must  specified

           <b>-padbottom</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Specifies the amount of external padding to leave on the bottom side of the slave. The  <u>value</u>
                   may have any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.

           <b>-padleft</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>

       <u>$master</u>-&gt;<b>formCheck</b>
           This  method  checks  whether  there is circular dependency in the attachments of the master's slaves
           (see "CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY" below).  It returns  the  Boolean  value  <b>TRUE</b>  if  it  discover  circular
           dependency and <b>FALSE</b> otherwise.

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>formForget</b>
           Removes  the  slave  from  its  master and unmaps its window.  The slave will no longer be managed by
           form. All attachment values with respect to its master window are  discarded.  If  another  slave  is
           attached  to  this  slave,  then the attachment of the other slave will be changed to grid attachment
           based on its geometry.

       <u>$master</u>-&gt;<b>formGrid</b>?(<u>x_size,</u> <u>y_size</u>)?
           When <u>x_size</u> and <u>y_size</u> are given, this method returns the number of grids of the <u>$master</u> window in  a
           pair  of  integers  of  the form (<u>x_size,</u> <u>y_size</u>). When both <u>x_size</u> and <u>y_size</u> are given, this method
           changes the number of horizontal and vertical grids on the master window.

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>formInfo</b>?(<u>-option)</u>?
           Queries the attachment options of a slave window. <u>-option</u> can be any of the options accepted  by  the
           <b>form</b>  method. If <u>-option</u> is given, only the value of that option is returned.  Otherwise, this method
           returns a list whose elements are the current configuration state of the  slave  given  in  the  same
           <u>option-value</u>  form  that  might  be  specified  to <b>form</b>. The first two elements in this list list are
           "<b>-in</b>=&gt;<u>$master</u>" where <u>$master</u> is the slave's master window.

       <u>$master</u>-&gt;<b>formSlaves</b>
           Returns a list of all of the slaves for the master window. The order of the slaves in the list is the
           same as their order in the packing order. If master has no slaves then an empty string is returned.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>ATTACHMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       One can specify an attachment for each side of a slave window managed by form. An attachment is specified
       in the the form "-<u>side</u> =&gt; [<u>anchor_point</u>, <u>offset</u>]". -<u>side</u> can be one of <b>-top</b>, <b>-bottom</b>, <b>-left</b> or <b>-right</b>.

       <u>Offset</u> is given in screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>).   A  positive  offset
       indicates  shifting  to a position to the right or bottom of an anchor point. A negative offset indicates
       shifting to a position to the left or top of an anchor point.

       <u>Anchor_point</u> can be given in one of the following forms:

       <b>Grid</b> <b>Attachment</b>
           The master window is divided into a number of horizontal and vertical grids. By  default  the  master
           window  is  divided into 100x100 grids; the number of grids can be adjusted by the <b>formGrid</b> method. A
           grid attachment anchor point is given by a <b>%</b> sign followed by an integer  value.  For  example,  <b>'%0'</b>
           specifies  the first grid line (the top or left edge of the master window). <b>'%100'</b> specifies the last
           grid line (the bottom or right edge of the master window).

       <b>Opposite</b> <b>Side</b> <b>Attachment</b>
           Opposite attachment specifies an anchor point located on the <b>opposite</b> side of another  slave  widget,
           which must be managed by form in the same master window. An opposite attachment anchor point is given
           by  the  name  of  another widget. For example, "<u>$b</u>-&gt;<b>form</b>(<b>-top</b>=&gt;[<u>$a</u>,0])" attaches the top side of the
           widget <u>$b</u> to the bottom of the widget <u>$a</u>.

       <b>Parallel</b> <b>Side</b> <b>Attachment</b>
           Opposite attachment specifies an anchor point located on the <b>same</b> side of another slave widget, which
           must be managed by form in the same master window. An parallel attachment anchor point  is  given  by
           the sign <b>&amp;</b> follwed by the name of another widget.  For example, "<u>$b</u>-&gt;<b>form</b>(<b>-top</b>=&gt;['&amp;',<u>$a</u>,0])" attaches
           the  top side of the widget <u>$b</u> to the top of the widget <u>$a</u>, making the top sides of these two widgets
           at the same vertical position in their parent window.

       <b>No</b> <b>Attachment</b>
           Specifies a side of the slave to be attached to nothing, indicated by the keyword <b>none</b>. When the <b>none</b>
           anchor point is given, the offset must be zero (or not present).  When a side of a slave is  attached
           to  <b>['none',</b>  <b>0]</b>,  the  position of this side is calculated by the position of the other side and the
           natural size of the slave. For example, if a the left side of a widget is attached  to  <b>['%0',</b>  <b>100]</b>,
           its  right  side  attached to <b>['none',</b> <b>0]</b>, and the natural size of the widget is <b>50</b> pixels, the right
           side of the widget will be positioned at pixel <b>['%0',</b> <b>149]</b>.  When both <b>-top</b> and <b>-bottom</b> are  attached
           to  <b>none</b>, then by default <b>-top</b> will be attached to <b>['%0',</b> <b>0]</b>. When both <b>-left</b> and <b>-right</b> are attached
           to none, then by default <b>-left</b> will be attached to <b>['%0',</b> <b>0]</b>.

       Shifting effects can be achieved by specifying a non-zero offset with an anchor point. In  the  following
       example, the top side of widget <u>\$b</u> is attached to the bottom of <u>\$a</u>; hence <u>\$b</u> always appears below <u>\$a</u>.
       Also,  the  left  edge of <u>\$b</u> is attached to the left side of <u>\$a</u> with a 10 pixel offest.  Therefore, the
       left edge of <u>\$b</u> is always shifted 10 pixels to the right of <u>\$a</u>'s left edge:

           <u>$b</u>-&gt;<b>form</b>(<b>-left</b>=&gt;[<u>$a</u>,10], <b>-top</b>=&gt;[<u>$a</u>,0]);

   <b>ABBREVIATIONS:</b>
       Certain abbreviations can be made on the attachment specifications:  First  an  offset  of  zero  can  be
       omitted.  Thus, the following two lines are equivalent:

           <u>$b</u>-&gt;<b>form</b>(<b>-top</b>=&gt;[<u>$a</u>,0], <b>-right</b>=&gt;['%100',0]);

           <u>$b</u>-&gt;<b>form</b>(<b>-top</b>=&gt;[<u>$a</u>], <b>-right</b>=&gt;'%100');

       In the second case, when the anchor point is omitted, the offset must be given. A default anchor point is
       chosen  according  to  the  value of the offset. If the anchor point is <b>0</b> or positive, the default anchor
       point %0 is used; thus, "<u>$b</u>-&gt;<b>form</b>(<b>-top</b>=&gt;15)" attaches the top edge of <u>$b</u> to a position  15  pixels  below
       the top edge of the master window. If the anchor point is "<b>-0</b>" or negative, the default anchor point <b>%100</b>
       is  used;  thus, "<u>$a</u>-&gt;<b>form</b>(<b>-right</b>=&gt;-2)" attaches the right edge of <u>\$a</u> to a position 2 pixels to the left
       of the master window's right edge.   An  further  example  below  shows  a  method  with  its  equivalent
       abbreviation.

           <u>$b</u>-&gt;<b>form</b>(<b>-top</b>=&gt;['%0',10], <b>-bottom</b>=&gt;['%100',0]);

           <u>$b</u>-&gt;<b>form</b>(<b>-top</b>=&gt;10, <b>-bottom</b>=&gt;-0);

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>SPRINGS</b></h4><pre>
       To be written.

</pre><h4><b>ALGORITHM</b> <b>OF</b> <b>FORM</b></h4><pre>
       <b>form</b>  starts  with  any  slave in the list of slaves of the master window. Then it tries to determine the
       position of each side of the slave.

       If the attachment of a side of the slave is  grid  attachment,  the  position  of  the  side  is  readily
       determined.

       If  the  attachment  of this side is <b>none</b>, then form tries to determine the position of the opposite side
       first, and then use the position of the opposite side and the natural size of the slave to determine  the
       position of this side.

       If  the attachment is opposite or parallel widget attachments, then form tries to determine the positions
       of the other widget first, and then use the positions of the other widget and the  natural  size  of  the
       slave  determine  the position of this side. This recursive algorithmis carried on until the positions of
       all slaves are determined.

</pre><h4><b>CIRCULAR</b> <b>DEPENDENCY</b></h4><pre>
       The algorithm of form will fail if a circular dependency exists in the attachments  of  the  slaves.  For
       example:

           <u>$c</u>-&gt;<b>form</b>(<b>-left</b>=&gt;<u>$b</u>);

           <u>$b</u>-&gt;<b>form</b>(<b>-right</b>=&gt;<u>$c</u>);

       In  this  example,  the  position  of  the left side of <u>$b</u> depends on the right side of <u>$c</u>, which in turn
       depends on the left side of <u>$b</u>.

       When a circular dependency is discovered during the execution of the form algorithm, form will generate a
       background error and the geometry of the slaves are undefined (and will be arbitrary). Notice  that  form
       only executes the algorithm when the specification of the slaves' attachments is complete.  Therefore, it
       allows  intermediate  states  of circular dependency during the specification of the slaves' attachments.
       Also, unlike the Motif Form manager widget, form defines circular dependency as ``<u>dependency</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u>  <u>same</u>
       <u>dimension</u>''.   Therefore,  the following code fragment will does not have circular dependency because the
       two widgets do not depend on each other in the same dimension (<u>$b</u> depends <u>$c</u> in the horizontal  dimension
       and <u>$c</u> depends on <u>$b</u> in the vertical dimension):

           <u>$b</u>-&gt;<b>form</b>(<b>-left</b>=&gt;<u>$c</u>);

           <u>$c</u>-&gt;<b>form</b>(<b>-top</b>=&gt;<u>$b</u>);
