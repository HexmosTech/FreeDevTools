       tixForm - Geometry manager based on attachment rules

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tixForm</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u> <u>?arg</u> <u>...?</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>tixForm</b>  command  is  used to communicate with the <b>tixForm</b> Geometry Manager, a geometry manager that
       arranges the geometry of the children in a parent window  according  to  attachment  rules.  The  <b>tixForm</b>
       geometry  manager  is  very flexible and powerful; it can be used to emulate all the existing features of
       the Tk packer and placer geometry managers (see <b>pack(n)</b>, <b>place(n)</b>).  The <b>tixForm</b> command can have any  of
       several forms, depending on the <u>option</u> argument:

       <b>tixForm</b> <u>slave</u> ?<u>options</u>?
              If  the  first  argument  to  <b>tixForm</b>  is  a window name (any value starting with ``.''), then the
              command is processed in the same way as <b>tixForm</b> <b>configure</b>.

       <b>tixForm</b> <b>check</b> <u>master</u>
              This command checks whether there is circular dependency in the attachments of the master's slaves
              (see the section <b>CIRCULAR</b> <b>DEPENDENCY</b> below). It returns the Boolean  value  <b>TRUE</b>  if  it  discover
              circular dependency and <b>FALSE</b> otherwise.

       <b>tixForm</b> <b>configure</b> <u>slave</u> ?<u>-option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Sets  or adjusts the attachment values of the slave window according to the <u>-option</u> <u>value</u> argument
              pairs.

              <b>-b</b> <u>attachment</u>
                     Abbreviation for the <b>-bottom</b> option.

              <b>-bottom</b> <u>attachment</u>
                     Specifies an attachment for the bottom edge  of  the  slave  window.  The  attachment  must
                     specied according to the section <b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>ATTACHMENTS</b> below.

              <b>-bottomspring</b> <u>weight</u>
                     Specifies  the weight of the spring at the bottom edge of the slave window. See the section
                     <b>USING</b> <b>SPRINGS</b> below.

              <b>-bp</b> <u>value</u>
                     Abbreviation for the <b>-padbottom</b> option.

              <b>-bs</b> <u>weight</u>
                     Abbreviation for the <b>-bottomspring</b> option.

              <b>-fill</b> <u>master</u>
                     Specifies the fillings when springs are used for this widget. The value must be <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>,  <b>both</b>
                     or <b>none</b>.

              <b>-in</b> <u>master</u>
                     Places  the  slave  window into the specified master window. If the slave was originally in
                     another master window, all attachment values with respect to the original master window are
                     discarded. Even if the attachment values are the same as in  the  original  master  window,
                     they  need to be specified again.  The <b>-in</b> flag, when needed, must appear as the first flag
                     after the name of the slave. Otherwise an error is generated.

              <b>-l</b> <u>attachment</u>
                     Abbreviation for the <b>-left</b> option.

              <b>-left</b> <u>attachment</u>
                     Specifies an attachment for the left edge of the slave window. The attachment must  specied

                     Specifies an attachment for the top edge of the slave window. The attachment  must  specied
                     according to the section <b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>ATTACHMENTS</b> below.

              <b>-topspring</b> <u>weight</u>
                     Specifies  the  weight  of  the spring at the top edge of the slave window. See the section
                     <b>USING</b> <b>SPRINGS</b> below.

       <b>tixForm</b> <b>forget</b> <u>slave</u> ?<u>slave</u> <u>...</u>?
              Removes each of the slaves from its master and unmaps their windows.  The slaves will no longer be
              managed by tixForm. All attachment values with respect to their master windows are  discarded.  If
              another slave is attached to this slave, then the attachment of the other slave will be changed to
              grid attachment based on its geometry.

       <b>tixForm</b> <b>grid</b> <u>master</u> ?<u>x_size</u> <u>y_size</u>?
              When <u>x_size</u> and <u>y_size</u> are given, this command returns the number of grids of the master window in
              a  pair  of  integers  of  the  form  {<u>x_size</u> <u>y_size</u>}. When both <u>x_size</u> and <u>y_size</u> are given, this
              command changes the number of horizontal and vertical grids on the master window.

       <b>tixForm</b> <b>info</b> <u>slave</u> ?<u>option</u>?
              Queries the attachment options of a slave window. <u>option</u> can be any of the options accepted by the
              <b>tixForm</b> <b>configure</b> command. If <u>option</u> is  given,  only  the  value  of  that  option  is  returned.
              Otherwise,  this  command returns a list whose elements are the current configuration state of the
              slave given in the same <u>option-value</u> form that might be specified to <b>tixForm</b> <b>configure</b>. The  first
              two elements in this list list are "<b>-in</b> <u>master</u>" where <u>master</u> is the slave's master window.

       <b>tixForm</b> <b>slaves</b> <u>master</u>
              Returns  a list of all of the slaves for the master window. The order of the slaves in the list is
              the same as their order in the packing order. If master has no slaves  then  an  empty  string  is
              returned.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>ATTACHMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       One  can  specify  an  attachment  for  each  side of a slave window managed by tixForm. An attachment is
       specified in the the form "-<u>side</u> {<u>anchor_point</u> <u>offset</u>}". -<u>side</u> can be one  of  <b>-top</b>,  <b>-bottom</b>,  <b>-left</b>  or
       <b>-right</b>.

       <u>Offset</u>  is  given  in screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>).  A positive offset
       indicates shifting to a position to the right or bottom of an anchor point. A negative  offset  indicates
       shifting to a position to the left or top of an anchor point.

       <u>Anchor_point</u> can be given in one of the following forms:

              <b>Grid</b> <b>Attachment</b>
                     The master window is divided into a number of horizontal and vertical grids. By default the
                     master  window  is  divided  into 100x100 grids; the number of grids can be adjusted by the
                     <b>tixForm</b> <b>grid</b> command. A grid attachment anchor point is given by a <b>%</b> sign  followed  by  an
                     <b>integer</b>  value.  For example, <b>%0</b> spceifies the first grid line (the top or left edge of the
                     master window). <b>%100</b> spceifies the last grid line (the bottom or right edge of  the  master
                     window).

              <b>Opposite</b> <b>Side</b> <b>Attachment</b>
                     Opposite attachment specifies an anchor point located on the <b>opposite</b> side of another slave
                     widget,  which must be managed by tixForm in the same master window. An opposite attachment
                     anchor point is given by the name of another widget. For example, "tixForm .b -top {.a  0}"
                     attaches the <b>top</b> side of the widget <b>.b</b> to the <b>bottom</b> of the widget <b>.a</b>.

              <b>Parallel</b> <b>Side</b> <b>Attachment</b>
                     Opposite  attachment  specifies  an  anchor point located on the <b>same</b> side of another slave
                     widget, which must be managed by tixForm in the same master window. An parallel  attachment
                     anchor  point  is  given by the sign <b>&amp;</b> follwed by the name of another widget.  For example,
                     "tixForm .b -top {&amp;.a 0}" attaches the <b>top</b> side of the widget <b>.b</b> to the <b>top</b> of  the  widget
                     <b>.a</b>, making the <b>top</b> sides of these two widgets at the same vertical position in their parent
                     window.

              <b>No</b> <b>Attachment</b>
                     Specifies  a  side  of  the slave to be attached to nothing, indicated by the keyword <b>none</b>.
                     When the <b>none</b> anchor point is given, the offser must be zero.

                     When a side of a slave is attached to <b>{none</b> <b>0}</b>, the position of this side is calculated  by
                     the  position  of  the  other side and the natural size of the slave. For example, if a the
                     <b>left</b> side of a widget is attached to <b>{%0</b> <b>100}</b>, its <b>right</b> side attached to <b>{none</b> <b>0}</b>, and the
                     natural size of the widget is <b>50</b> pixels, the <b>right</b> side of the widget will be positioned at
                     pixel <b>{%0</b> <b>149}</b>.

                     When both <b>-top</b> and <b>-bottom</b> are attached to <b>none</b>, then by default <b>-top</b> will be  attached  to
                     <b>{%0</b>  <b>0}</b>.  When  both  <b>-left</b>  and <b>-right</b> are attached to none, then by default <b>-left</b> will be
                     attached to <b>{%0</b> <b>0}</b>.

       Shifting effects can be achieved by specifying a non-zero offset with an anchor point. In  the  following
       example,  the  <b>top</b>  side  of widget <b>.b</b> is attached to the <b>bottom</b> of <b>.a</b>; hence <b>.b</b> always appears below <b>.a</b>.
       Also, the left edge of <b>.b</b> is attached to the <b>left</b> side of <b>.a</b> with a 10 pixel offest.  Therefore, the <b>left</b>
       edge of <b>.b</b> is always shifted 10 pixels to the right of <b>.a</b>'s <b>left</b> edge:

       tixForm .b -left {.a 10} -top {.a 0}

       <b>ABBREVIATIONS:</b> Certain abbreviations can be made on the attachment specifications:  First  an  offset  of
       zero can be omitted.  Thus, the following two lines are equivalent:

       tixForm .b -top {.a 0} -right {%100 0} tixForm .b -top {.a}   -right {%100}

       Also,  because of the way TCL handles lists, when you omit the offset, you can also leave out the braces.
       So you can further simplify the above to:

       tixForm .b -top .a -right %100

       In the second case, when the anchor point is omitted, the offset must be given. A default anchor point is
       chosen according to the value of the offset. If the anchor point is <b>0</b> or  positive,  the  default  anchor
       point  %0  is  used; thus, "tixForm .b -top 15" attaches the top edge of <b>.b</b> to a position 15 pixels below
       the top edge of the master window. If the anchor point is "<b>-0</b>" or negative, the default anchor point <b>%100</b>
       is used; thus, "tixForm .a -right -2" attaches the right edge of <b>.a</b> to a position 2 pixels to the left of
       the master window's  <b>right</b>  edge.   An  further  example  below  shows  a  command  with  its  equivalent
       abbreviation.  tixForm .b -top {%0 10} -bottom {%100 0} tixForm .b -top 10      -bottom -0

       To be written.

</pre><h4><b>ALGORITHM</b> <b>OF</b> <b>TIXFORM</b></h4><pre>
       TixForm  starts with any slave in the list of slaves of the master window. Then it tries to determine the
       position of each side of the slave.

       If the attachment of a side of the slave is  grid  attachment,  the  position  of  the  side  is  readily
       determined.

       If the attachment of this side is <b>none</b>, then tixForm tries to determine the position of the opposite side
       first,  and then use the position of the opposite side and the natural size of the slave to determine the
       position of this side.

       If the attachment is opposite or parallel  widget  attachments,  then  tixForm  tries  to  determine  the
       positions  of the other widget first, and then use the positions of the other widget and the natural size
       of the slave determine the position of this  side.  This  recursive  algorithmis  carried  on  until  the
       positions of all slaves are determined.

</pre><h4><b>CIRCULAR</b> <b>DEPENDENCY</b></h4><pre>
       The  algorithm of tixForm will fail if a circular dependency exists in the attachments of the slaves. For
       example:

       tixForm .c -left .b tixForm .b -right .c

       In this example, the position of the left side of <b>.b</b> depends on the right  side  of  <b>.c</b>,  which  in  turn
       depends on the left side of <b>.b</b>.

       When  a  circular  dependency  is  discovered during the execution of the tixForm algorithm, tixForm will
       generate a background error and the geometry of the slaves are undefined (and will be arbitrary).  Notice
       that  tixForm  only executes the algorithm when the specification of the slaves' attachments is complete.
       Therefore, it allows intermediate states of circular dependency during the specification of  the  slaves'
       attachments.   Also,  unlike  the  Motif  Form  manager  widget,  tixForm  defines circular dependency as
       "<u>dependency</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>dimension</u>". Therefore, the following code fragment will does  not  have  circular
       dependency  because  the  two widgets do not depend on each other in the same dimension (<b>.b</b> depends <b>.c</b> in
       the horizontal dimension and <b>.c</b> depends on <b>.b</b> in the vertical dimension):

       tixForm .b -left .c tixForm .c -top .b
