</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Exporter::Tiny::Manual::Etc - odds and ends

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Utility</b> <b>Functions</b>
       Exporter::Tiny is itself an exporter!

       These functions are really for internal use, but can be exported if you need them:

       "mkopt(\@array)"
           Similar  to  "mkopt"  from Data::OptList. It doesn't support all the fancy options that Data::OptList
           does ("moniker", "require_unique", "must_be" and "name_test") but runs about 50% faster.

       "mkopt_hash(\@array)"
           Similar to "mkopt_hash" from Data::OptList. See also "mkopt".

   <b>History</b>
       Type::Library had a bunch of custom exporting code which poked  coderefs  into  its  caller's  stash.  It
       needed  this  to be something more powerful than most exporters so that it could switch between exporting
       Moose, Mouse and Moo-compatible objects on request. Sub::Exporter would have been capable,  but  had  too
       many dependencies for the Type::Tiny project.

       Meanwhile  Type::Utils,  Types::TypeTiny and Test::TypeTiny each used the venerable Exporter.pm. However,
       this meant they were unable to use the features like  Sub::Exporter-style  function  renaming  which  I'd
       built into Type::Library:

          ## import "Str" but rename it to "String".
          use Types::Standard "Str" =&gt; { -as =&gt; "String" };

       And  so  I  decided  to  factor  out code that could be shared by all Type-Tiny's exporters into a single
       place: Exporter::TypeTiny.

       As  of  version  0.026,  Exporter::TypeTiny  was  also  made  available  as  Exporter::Tiny,  distributed
       independently on CPAN. CHOCOLATEBOY had convinced me that it was mature enough to live a life of its own.

       As of version 0.030, Type-Tiny depends on Exporter::Tiny and Exporter::TypeTiny is being phased out.

   <b>Obligatory</b> <b>Exporter</b> <b>Comparison</b>
       Exporting  is  unlikely  to  be  your application's performance bottleneck, but nonetheless here are some
       comparisons.

       <b>Comparative</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>Devel::SizeMe:</b>

          Exporter                     217.1Kb
          Sub::Exporter::Progressive   263.2Kb
          Exporter::Tiny               267.7Kb
          Exporter + Exporter::Heavy   281.5Kb
          Exporter::Renaming           406.2Kb
          Sub::Exporter                701.0Kb

       (Exporter::Renaming globally changes the behaviour of Exporter.pm, so could not be included in  the  same
       benchmarks.)
