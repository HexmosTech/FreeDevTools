       Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt - Blowfish-based Unix crypt() password hash

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt qw(bcrypt_hash);

               $hash = bcrypt_hash({
                               key_nul =&gt; 1,
                               cost =&gt; 8,
                               salt =&gt; $salt,
                       }, $password);

               use Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt qw(en_base64 de_base64);

               $text = en_base64($octets);
               $octets = de_base64($text);

               use Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt qw(bcrypt);

               $hashed_password = bcrypt($password, $settings);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements the Blowfish-based Unix <b>crypt()</b> password hashing algorithm, known as "bcrypt".
       This hash uses a variant of Blowfish, known as "Eksblowfish", modified to have particularly expensive key
       scheduling.  Eksblowfish and bcrypt were devised by Niels Provos and David Mazieres for OpenBSD.  The
       design is described in a paper at &lt;<a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/provos.html">http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/provos.html</a>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       bcrypt_hash(SETTINGS, PASSWORD)
           Hashes  PASSWORD according to the supplied SETTINGS, and returns the 23-octet hash.  SETTINGS must be
           a reference to a hash, with these keys:

           <b>key_nul</b>
               Truth value: whether to append a NUL to the password before using it as a key.  The algorithm  as
               originally  devised  does not do this, but it was later modified to do it.  The version that does
               append NUL is to be preferred; not doing so is supported only for backward compatibility.

           <b>cost</b>
               Non-negative integer controlling the cost of the hash function.   The  number  of  operations  is
               proportional to 2^cost.

           <b>salt</b>
               Exactly sixteen octets of salt.

       en_base64(BYTES)
           Encodes the octet string textually using the form of base 64 that is conventionally used with bcrypt.

       de_base64(TEXT)
           Decodes  an  octet string that was textually encoded using the form of base 64 that is conventionally
           used with bcrypt.

       bcrypt(PASSWORD, SETTINGS)
           This is a version of "crypt" (see "crypt" in perlfunc) that implements the bcrypt algorithm.  It does
           not implement any other hashing algorithms, so if others are desired then it necessary to examine the
           algorithm prefix in SETTINGS and dispatch between more than one version of "crypt".

           SETTINGS must be a string which encodes the algorithm parameters, including salt.  It must begin with
           "$2", optional "a", "$", two digits, "$", and 22 base 64 digits.  The rest of the string is  ignored.
           The presence of the optional "a" means that a NUL is to be appended to the password before it is used
           as  a  key.   The  two  digits  set  the cost parameter.  The 22 base 64 digits encode the salt.  The
           function will "die" if SETTINGS does not have this format.

           The PASSWORD is hashed according to the SETTINGS.  The value returned is a string which  encodes  the
           algorithm  parameters  and  the hash: the parameters are in the same format required in SETTINGS, and
           the hash is appended in the form of 31 base 64 digits.  This result is  suitable  to  be  used  as  a
           SETTINGS string for input to this function: the hash part of the string is ignored on input.
