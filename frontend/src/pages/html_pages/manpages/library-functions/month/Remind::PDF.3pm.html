       Remind::PDF - Render a month's worth of Remind data to PDF

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Remind::PDF-&gt;create_from_stream($in,</b> <b>$specials_accepted)</b>
       This method reads data from an open file handle $in.  $specials_accepted is a hashref of SPECIAL reminder
       types to accept; the key is the name of the SPECIAL (all lower-case) and the value should be 1.  Any
       SPECIAL reminders not in the hash are ignored.

       This function returns a two-element array: "($obj, $err)".  On success, $obj will be a "Remind::PDF"
       object and $err will be undef.  On failure, $obj will be undef and $err will be an error message.

   <b>Remind::PDF-&gt;create_from_hash($hash,</b> <b>$specials_accepted)</b>
       This method takes data from a hash $hash, which must be one month's worth of data from "remind -ppp"
       output.  $specials_accepted is a hashref of SPECIAL reminder types to accept; the key is the name of the
       SPECIAL (all lower-case) and the value should be 1.  Any SPECIAL reminders not in the hash are ignored.

       This function returns a two-element array: "($obj, $err)".  On success, $obj will be a "Remind::PDF"
       object and $err will be undef.  On failure, $obj will be undef and $err will be an error message.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>read_one_month($in,</b> <b>$first_line,</b> <b>$specials_accepted)</b>
       This function reads one month's worth of data from the file handle $in.  $first_line is the line that was
       read from $in just before calling this function.  $specials_accepted is a hashref as documented above.

       The return value is the same "($obj, $err)" two-element array as "create_from_stream" returns.

   <b>read_one_month_p($in,</b> <b>$specials_accepted)</b>
       This function reads one month's worth of data from the file handle $in, assuming the original "remind -p"
       format.  $specials_accepted is a hashref as documented above.

       The return value is the same "($obj, $err)" two-element array as "create_from_stream" returns.

   <b>parse_oldstyle_line</b> <b>($line)</b>
       This method parses an old-style "remind -p" line and returns a hashref containing some or all of the hash
       keys found in the newer "remind -pp" JSON output.

   <b>setup_daymap</b>
       Set up the array that maps ($row, $col) to day number (or -1 for rows/cols out of range.)

   <b>read_one_month_pp($in,</b> <b>$specials_accepted)</b>
       This function reads one month's worth of data from the file handle $in, assuming the "remind -pp"
       partial-JSON format.  $specials_accepted is a hashref as documented above.

       The return value is the same "($obj, $err)" two-element array as "create_from_stream" returns.

   <b>accept_special($hash,</b> <b>$specials_accepted)</b>
       Given a hashref $hash consisting of one entry parsed from the "remind -p" stream and a $specials_accepted
       hash, return 1 if we should include this entry in the calendar or 0 if not.

   <b>find_last_special($special,</b> <b>$entries)</b>
       Given an array of Reminder entries, find the last $special-type SPECIAL in the array.  Return the entry
       if one was found or undef if not.

   <b>render($cr,</b> <b>$settings)</b>
       Render a calendar for one month.  $cr is a Cairo drawing context, and $settings is a settings hash passed
       in by the caller.  See the source code of "rem2pdf" for the contents of $settings

   <b>draw_row($cr,</b> <b>$settings,</b> <b>$so_far,</b> <b>$row,</b> <b>$start_day,</b> <b>$start_col)</b>
       Draw a single row in the calendar.  $cr is a Cairo drawing context and $settings is the settings hash
       passed to "render".  $so_far is the Y-coordinate of the top of the row; drawing starts at this
       coordinate.  $start_day is the day of the month at which the row starts and $start col is the column
       number (0-6) at which to start drawing from $start_day

       Returns the Y coordinate at which to start drawing the <u>next</u> calendar row.

   <b>col_box_coordinates($so_far,</b> <b>$col,</b> <b>$height,</b> <b>$settings)</b>
       Returns a four-element array "($x1, $y1, $x2, $y2)" representing the bounding box of the calendar box at
       column $col (0-6).  $height is the height of the box and $settings is the settings hashref passed to
       "render".

   <b>draw_day($cr,</b> <b>$settings,</b> <b>$so_far,</b> <b>$day,</b> <b>$col,</b> <b>$height)</b>
       Renders a single day's worth of reminders.  $cr is a Cairo drawing context and $settings is the settings
       hash passed to "render".  $so_far is the Y-coordinate of the top of the box and $col is the column
       number.

       $height is the height of the box.  If $height is passed in as zero, then do not actually render
       anything... instead, compute how high the box should be.  If $height is non-zero, then it is the height
       of the box.

       Returns the height required for the calendar box.

   <b>draw_daynames($cr,</b> <b>$settings,</b> <b>$so_far)</b>
       Draw the weekday names heading.  $cr is a Cairo drawing context and $settings is the settings hash passed
       to "render".  $so_far is the Y-coordinate of the top of the row; drawing starts at this coordinate.

       Returns the Y coordinate at which to start drawing the first calendar row.

   <b>draw_title($cr,</b> <b>$settings)</b>
       Draw the title ("Monthname Year") at the top of the calendar.  $cr is a Cairo drawing context and
       $settings is the settings hash passed to "render".

       Returns the Y coordinate at which to start drawing the row containing the weekday names.

   <b>draw_small_calendar($cr,</b> <b>$x,</b> <b>$y,</b> <b>$width,</b> <b>$height,</b> <b>$settings,</b> <b>$month,</b> <b>$days,</b> <b>$start_wkday)</b>
       Draw a small calendar on the Cairo context $cr.  The top left-hand corner of the box is at "($x, $y)" and
       the size of the box is "($width, $height").  $settings is the settings hashref passed to "render".
       $month is the name of the month to draw and $days is the number of days in the month.  Finally,
       $start_wkday is the weekday (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday) on which the month starts

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Remind::PDF::Multi - A container for multiple months' worth of calendar data

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "remind -ppp" output consists of a JSON array with each element representing one month's worth of
       reminders.  "Remind::PDF::Multi" reads this output and returns an instance of itself containing an array
       of "Remind::PDF" objects, one object for each month.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Remind::PDF::Multi-&gt;create_from_stream($in,</b> <b>$specials_accepted)</b>
       This method reads data from an open file handle $in.  $specials_accepted is a hashref of SPECIAL reminder
       types to accept; the key is the name of the SPECIAL (all lower-case) and the value should be 1.  Any
       SPECIAL reminders not in the hash are ignored.

       This function returns a two-element array: "($obj, $err)".  On success, $obj will be a
       "Remind::PDF::Multi" object and $err will be undef.  On failure, $obj will be undef and $err will be an
       error message.

   <b>Remind::PDF::Multi-&gt;create_from_json($json,</b> <b>$specials_accepted)</b>
       This method takes data from a JSON string &lt;$json&gt;.  $specials_accepted is a hashref of SPECIAL reminder
       types to accept; the key is the name of the SPECIAL (all lower-case) and the value should be 1.  Any
       SPECIAL reminders not in the hash are ignored.

       This function returns a two-element array: "($obj, $err)".  On success, $obj will be a
       "Remind::PDF::Multi" object and $err will be undef.  On failure, $obj will be undef and $err will be an
       error message.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>render($cr,</b> <b>$settings)</b>
       Iterate through all the "Remind::PDF" objects and call their "render" methods.  This method renders as
       many months worth of calendar data as were read from the "remind -ppp" stream
