</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pigpiod_if2 - A C library to interface to the pigpio daemon.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;pigpiod_if2.h&gt;

       gcc -Wall -pthread -o prog prog.c -lpigpiod_if2 -lrt

        ./prog

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pigpiod_if2 is a C library for the Raspberry which allows control of the GPIO via the socket interface to
       the pigpio daemon.

   <b>Features</b>
       o hardware timed PWM on any of GPIO 0-31

       o hardware timed servo pulses on any of GPIO 0-31

       o callbacks when any of GPIO 0-31 change state

       o callbacks at timed intervals

       o reading/writing all of the GPIO in a bank as one operation

       o individually setting GPIO modes, reading and writing

       o notifications when any of GPIO 0-31 change state

       o the construction of output waveforms with microsecond timing

       o rudimentary permission control over GPIO

       o a simple interface to start and stop new threads

       o I2C, SPI, and serial link wrappers

       o creating and running scripts on the pigpio daemon

   <b>GPIO</b>
       ALL GPIO are identified by their Broadcom number.

   <b>Notes</b>
       The PWM and servo pulses are timed using the DMA and PWM/PCM peripherals.

   <b>Usage</b>
       Include &lt;pigpiod_if2.h&gt; in your source files.

       Assuming your source is in prog.c use the following command to build

       gcc -Wall -pthread -o prog prog.c -lpigpiod_if2 -lrt

       to run make sure the pigpio daemon is running

       sudo pigpiod

        ./prog # sudo is not required to run programs linked to pigpiod_if2

       For examples see x_pigpiod_if2.c within the pigpio archive file.

   <b>Notes</b>
       All the functions which return an int return &lt; 0 on error

           Notes

           If PWM is currently active on the GPIO its dutycycle will be scaled to reflect the new range.

           The  real range, the number of steps between fully off and fully on for each of the 18 available GPIO
           frequencies is

             25(#1),    50(#2),   100(#3),   125(#4),    200(#5),    250(#6),
            400(#7),   500(#8),   625(#9),   800(#10),  1000(#11),  1250(#12),
           2000(#13), 2500(#14), 4000(#15), 5000(#16), 10000(#17), 20000(#18)

           The real value set by set_PWM_range is (dutycycle * real range) / range.

       <b>int</b> <b>get_PWM_range(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio)</b>

           Get the range of PWM values being used on the GPIO.

                  pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           user_gpio: 0-31.

           Returns the dutycycle range used for the GPIO if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO.

           If a hardware clock or hardware PWM is active on the GPIO the reported range will be 1000000 (1M).

       <b>int</b> <b>get_PWM_real_range(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio)</b>

           Get the real underlying range of PWM values being used on the GPIO.

           user_gpio: 0-31.

           Returns the real range used for the GPIO if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO.

           If a hardware clock is active on the GPIO the reported real range will be 1000000 (1M).

           If hardware PWM is active on the GPIO the reported real range will be approximately 250M  divided  by
           the set PWM frequency.

       <b>int</b> <b>set_PWM_frequency(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>frequency)</b>

           Set the frequency (in Hz) of the PWM to be used on the GPIO.

                  pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           user_gpio: 0-31.
           frequency: &gt;=0 (Hz).

           Returns the numerically closest frequency if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO or PI_NOT_PERMITTED.

           If PWM is currently active on the GPIO it will be switched off and then back on at the new frequency.

           Each GPIO can be independently set to one of 18 different PWM frequencies.

           The selectable frequencies depend upon the sample rate which may be 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, or 10 microseconds
           (default 5).  The sample rate is set when the pigpio daemon is started.

           The frequencies for each sample rate are:

                                  Hertz

                  1: 40000 20000 10000 8000 5000 4000 2500 2000 1600

       <b>int</b> <b>get_PWM_frequency(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio)</b>

           Get the frequency of PWM being used on the GPIO.

                  pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           user_gpio: 0-31.

           For normal PWM the frequency will be that defined for the GPIO by <b>set_PWM_frequency</b>.

           If a hardware clock is active on the GPIO the reported frequency will be that set by <b>hardware_clock</b>.

           If hardware PWM is active on the GPIO the reported frequency will be that set by <b>hardware_PWM</b>.

           Returns the frequency (in hertz) used for the GPIO if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO.

       <b>int</b> <b>set_servo_pulsewidth(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>pulsewidth)</b>

           Start (500-2500) or stop (0) servo pulses on the GPIO.

                   pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
            user_gpio: 0-31.
           pulsewidth: 0 (off), 500 (anti-clockwise) - 2500 (clockwise).

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO, PI_BAD_PULSEWIDTH or PI_NOT_PERMITTED.

           The  selected  pulsewidth  will  continue  to  be  transmitted  until changed by a subsequent call to
           set_servo_pulsewidth.

           The pulsewidths supported by servos varies and should probably be determined by experiment.  A  value
           of 1500 should always be safe and represents the mid-point of rotation.

           You can DAMAGE a servo if you command it to move beyond its limits.

           OTHER UPDATE RATES:

           This  function updates servos at 50Hz.  If you wish to use a different update frequency you will have
           to use the PWM functions.

           Update Rate (Hz)     50   100  200  400  500
           1E6/Hz            20000 10000 5000 2500 2000

           Firstly set the desired PWM frequency using <b>set_PWM_frequency</b>.

           Then set the PWM range using <b>set_PWM_range</b> to  1E6/Hz.   Doing  this  allows  you  to  use  units  of
           microseconds when setting the servo pulsewidth.

           E.g. If you want to update a servo connected to GPIO 25 at 400Hz

           set_PWM_frequency(25, 400);
           set_PWM_range(25, 2500);

           Thereafter  use  the  <b>set_PWM_dutycycle</b>  function to move the servo, e.g. set_PWM_dutycycle(25, 1500)
           will set a 1500 us pulse.

       <b>int</b> <b>get_servo_pulsewidth(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio)</b>

           Return the servo pulsewidth in use on a GPIO.

                  pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           user_gpio: 0-31.

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO or PI_NOT_SERVO_GPIO.

       <b>int</b> <b>notify_open(int</b> <b>pi)</b>

           Get a free notification handle.

           pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).

           Returns a handle greater than or equal to zero if OK, otherwise PI_NO_HANDLE.

           A notification is a method for being notified of GPIO state changes via a pipe.

           Pipes are only accessible from the local machine so this function serves no purpose if you are  using
           the  library  from a remote machine.  The in-built (socket) notifications provided by <b>callback</b> should
           be used instead.

           Notifications for handle x will be available at the pipe named /dev/pigpiox (where x  is  the  handle
           number).  E.g. if the function returns 15 then the notifications must be read from /dev/pigpio15.

       <b>int</b> <b>notify_begin(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>handle,</b> <b>uint32_t</b> <b>bits)</b>

           Start notifications on a previously opened handle.

               pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           handle: 0-31 (as returned by <b>notify_open</b>)
             bits: a mask indicating the GPIO to be notified.

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_HANDLE.

           The notification sends state changes for each GPIO whose corresponding bit in bits is set.

           Each notification occupies 12 bytes in the fifo as follows:

           typedef struct
           {
              uint16_t seqno;
              uint16_t flags;
              uint32_t tick;
              uint32_t level;
           } gpioReport_t;

           seqno: starts at 0 each time the handle is opened and then increments by one for each report.

           flags: three flags are defined, PI_NTFY_FLAGS_WDOG, PI_NTFY_FLAGS_ALIVE, and PI_NTFY_FLAGS_EVENT.

           If  bit  5  is  set  (PI_NTFY_FLAGS_WDOG)  then bits 0-4 of the flags indicate a GPIO which has had a
           watchdog timeout.

           If bit 6 is set (PI_NTFY_FLAGS_ALIVE) this indicates a keep alive signal on the  pipe/socket  and  is
           sent once a minute in the absence of other notification activity.

           If  bit  7  is  set (PI_NTFY_FLAGS_EVENT) then bits 0-4 of the flags indicate an event which has been
           triggered.

           tick: the number of microseconds since system boot.  It wraps around after 1h12m.

           level: indicates the level of each GPIO.  If bit 1&lt;&lt;x is set then GPIO x is high.

       <b>int</b> <b>notify_pause(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>handle)</b>

           Pause notifications on a previously opened handle.

               pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           handle: 0-31 (as returned by <b>notify_open</b>)

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_HANDLE.

           Notifications for the handle are suspended until <b>notify_begin</b> is called again.

       <b>int</b> <b>notify_close(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>handle)</b>

           Stop notifications on a previously opened handle and release the handle for reuse.

               pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           handle: 0-31 (as returned by <b>notify_open</b>)

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_HANDLE.

       <b>int</b> <b>set_watchdog(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>timeout)</b>

           Sets a watchdog for a GPIO.

                  pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           user_gpio: 0-31.
             timeout: 0-60000.

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO or PI_BAD_WDOG_TIMEOUT.

           The watchdog is nominally in milliseconds.

           Only one watchdog may be registered per GPIO.

           The watchdog may be cancelled by setting timeout to 0.

           Once a watchdog has been started callbacks for the GPIO will  be  triggered  every  timeout  interval
           after the last GPIO activity.

           The callback will receive the special level PI_TIMEOUT.

       <b>int</b> <b>set_glitch_filter(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>steady)</b>

           Sets a glitch filter on a GPIO.

           Level  changes  on  the  GPIO  are  not reported unless the level has been stable for at least <b>steady</b>
           microseconds.  The level is then reported.  Level  changes  of  less  than  <b>steady</b>  microseconds  are
           ignored.

                  pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           user_gpio: 0-31
              steady: 0-300000

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO, or PI_BAD_FILTER.

           This  filter  affects  the  GPIO  samples returned to callbacks set up with <b>callback</b>, <b>callback_ex</b> and
           <b>wait_for_edge</b>.

           It does not affect levels read by <b>gpio_read</b>, <b>read_bank_1</b>, or <b>read_bank_2</b>.

           Each (stable) edge will be timestamped <b>steady</b> microseconds after it was first detected.

       <b>int</b> <b>set_noise_filter(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>steady,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>active)</b>

           Sets a noise filter on a GPIO.

           Level changes on the GPIO are ignored until a level which has been stable for <b>steady</b> microseconds  is
           detected.   Level  changes  on  the  GPIO  are  then reported for <b>active</b> microseconds after which the
           process repeats.

                  pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           user_gpio: 0-31
              steady: 0-300000
              active: 0-1000000

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO, or PI_BAD_FILTER.

           This filter affects the GPIO samples returned to callbacks set  up  with  <b>callback</b>,  <b>callback_ex</b>  and
           <b>wait_for_edge</b>.

           It does not affect levels read by <b>gpio_read</b>, <b>read_bank_1</b>, or <b>read_bank_2</b>.

           Level  changes before and after the active period may be reported.  Your software must be designed to
           cope with such reports.

       <b>uint32_t</b> <b>read_bank_1(int</b> <b>pi)</b>

           Read the levels of the bank 1 GPIO (GPIO 0-31).

           pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).

           The returned 32 bit integer has a bit set if the corresponding GPIO is logic 1.  GPIO n has bit value

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_SOME_PERMITTED.

           A status of PI_SOME_PERMITTED indicates that the user is not allowed to write to one or more  of  the

       <b>int</b> <b>hardware_clock(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>gpio,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>clkfreq)</b>

           Starts a hardware clock on a GPIO at the specified frequency.  Frequencies above 30MHz  are  unlikely
           to work.

                  pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
                gpio: see description
           frequency: 0 (off) or 4689-250M (13184-375M for the BCM2711)

           Returns  0  if  OK,  otherwise  PI_NOT_PERMITTED,  PI_BAD_GPIO, PI_NOT_HCLK_GPIO, PI_BAD_HCLK_FREQ,or
           PI_BAD_HCLK_PASS.

           The same clock is available on multiple GPIO.  The latest frequency setting will be used by all  GPIO
           which share a clock.

           The GPIO must be one of the following.

           Access  to  clock  1 is protected by a password as its use will likely crash the Pi.  The password is
           given by or'ing 0x5A000000 with the GPIO number.

       <b>int</b> <b>hardware_PWM(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>gpio,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>PWMfreq,</b> <b>uint32_t</b> <b>PWMduty)</b>

           Starts hardware PWM on a GPIO at the specified frequency and dutycycle.  Frequencies above 30MHz  are
           unlikely to work.

           NOTE: Any waveform started by <b>wave_send_*</b> or <b>wave_chain</b> will be cancelled.

           This  function is only valid if the pigpio main clock is PCM.  The main clock defaults to PCM but may

           12  PWM channel 0  All models but A and B
           13  PWM channel 1  All models but A and B
           18  PWM channel 0  All models
           19  PWM channel 1  All models but A and B

           40  PWM channel 0  Compute module only
           41  PWM channel 1  Compute module only
           45  PWM channel 1  Compute module only
           52  PWM channel 0  Compute module only
           53  PWM channel 1  Compute module only

           The actual number of steps beween off and fully on is the integral part of 250M/PWMfreq (375M/PWMfreq
           for the BCM2711).

           The actual frequency set is 250M/steps (375M/steps for the BCM2711).

           There will only be a million steps for a PWMfreq of 250 (375 for the BCM2711). Lower frequencies will
           have more steps and higher frequencies will have fewer steps.  PWMduty  is  automatically  scaled  to
           take this into account.

       <b>uint32_t</b> <b>get_current_tick(int</b> <b>pi)</b>

           Gets the current system tick.

           pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).

           Tick is the number of microseconds since system boot.

           As  tick  is  an  unsigned  32  bit  quantity  it  wraps  around  after  2**32 microseconds, which is
           approximately 1 hour 12 minutes.

       <b>uint32_t</b> <b>get_hardware_revision(int</b> <b>pi)</b>

           Get the Pi's hardware revision number.

           pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).

           The hardware revision is the last few characters on the Revision line of /proc/cpuinfo.

           If the hardware revision can not be found or is not a valid hexadecimal number the  function  returns
           0.

           The revision number can be used to determine the assignment of GPIO to pins (see <b>gpio</b>).

           There are at least three types of board.

           Type 1 boards have hardware revision numbers of 2 and 3.

           Type 2 boards have hardware revision numbers of 4, 5, 6, and 15.

           Type 3 boards have hardware revision numbers of 16 or greater.

       <b>uint32_t</b> <b>get_pigpio_version(int</b> <b>pi)</b>

           Returns the pigpio version.

           pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).

       <b>int</b> <b>wave_clear(int</b> <b>pi)</b>

           This function clears all waveforms and any data added by calls to the <b>wave_add_*</b> functions.

           pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).

           Returns 0 if OK.

       <b>int</b> <b>wave_add_new(int</b> <b>pi)</b>

           This function starts a new empty waveform.  You wouldn't normally need to call this function as it is
           automatically called after a waveform is created with the <b>wave_create</b> function.

           pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).

           Returns 0 if OK.

       <b>int</b> <b>wave_add_generic(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>numPulses,</b> <b>gpioPulse_t</b> <b>*pulses)</b>

           This function adds a number of pulses to the current waveform.

                  pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           numPulses: the number of pulses.
              pulses: an array of pulses.

           Returns the new total number of pulses in the current waveform if OK, otherwise PI_TOO_MANY_PULSES.

           The pulses are interleaved in time order within the existing waveform (if any).

           Merging  allows  the waveform to be built in parts, that is the settings for GPIO#1 can be added, and
           then GPIO#2 etc.

           If the added waveform is intended to start after or within the existing waveform then the first pulse
           should consist solely of a delay.

       <b>int</b> <b>wave_add_serial(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>baud,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>data_bits,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>stop_bits,</b>
       <b>unsigned</b> <b>offset,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>numBytes,</b> <b>char</b> <b>*str)</b>

           This function adds a waveform representing serial data to the existing waveform (if any).  The serial
           data starts offset microseconds from the start of the waveform.

                  pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           user_gpio: 0-31.
                baud: 50-1000000
           data_bits: number of data bits (1-32)
           stop_bits: number of stop half bits (2-8)
              offset: &gt;=0
            numBytes: &gt;=1
                 str: an array of chars.

           Returns the new total number of pulses in the current waveform  if  OK,  otherwise  PI_BAD_USER_GPIO,
           PI_BAD_WAVE_BAUD,   PI_BAD_DATABITS,   PI_BAD_STOP_BITS,   PI_TOO_MANY_CHARS,  PI_BAD_SER_OFFSET,  or
           PI_TOO_MANY_PULSES.

           NOTES:

           The serial data is formatted as one start bit, <b>data_bits</b> data bits, and <b>stop_bits</b>/2 stop bits.

           It is legal to add serial data streams with different baud rates to the same waveform.

           <b>numBytes</b> is the number of bytes of data in str.

           The bytes required for each character depend upon <b>data_bits</b>.

           For <b>data_bits</b> 1-8 there will be one byte per character.
           For <b>data_bits</b> 9-16 there will be two bytes per character.
           For <b>data_bits</b> 17-32 there will be four bytes per character.

       <b>int</b> <b>wave_create(int</b> <b>pi)</b>

           This function creates a waveform from the  data  provided  by  the  prior  calls  to  the  <b>wave_add_*</b>
           functions.    Upon   success   a  wave  id  greater  than  or  equal  to  0  is  returned,  otherwise
           PI_EMPTY_WAVEFORM, PI_TOO_MANY_CBS, PI_TOO_MANY_OOL, or PI_NO_WAVEFORM_ID.

           pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).

           The data provided by the <b>wave_add_*</b> functions is consumed by this function.

           As many waveforms may be created as there is space available.  The wave id is passed  to  <b>wave_send_*</b>
           to specify the waveform to transmit.

           Normal usage would be

           Step 1. <b>wave_clear</b> to clear all waveforms and added data.

           Step 2. <b>wave_add_*</b> calls to supply the waveform data.

           Step 3. <b>wave_create</b> to create the waveform and get a unique id

           Repeat steps 2 and 3 as needed.

           Step 4. <b>wave_send_*</b> with the id of the waveform to transmit.

           A waveform comprises one or more pulses.  Each pulse consists of a <b>gpioPulse_t</b> structure.

           typedef struct
           {
              uint32_t gpioOn;
              uint32_t gpioOff;
              uint32_t usDelay;
           } gpioPulse_t;

           The fields specify

           1) the GPIO to be switched on at the start of the pulse.
           2) the GPIO to be switched off at the start of the pulse.
           3) the delay in microseconds before the next pulse.

           Any  or  all  the  fields  can be zero.  It doesn't make any sense to set all the fields to zero (the
           pulse will be ignored).

           When a waveform is started each pulse is executed in order with the specified delay between the pulse
           and the next.

           Returns the new waveform id if OK, otherwise PI_EMPTY_WAVEFORM,  PI_NO_WAVEFORM_ID,  PI_TOO_MANY_CBS,
           or PI_TOO_MANY_OOL.

       <b>int</b> <b>wave_create_and_pad(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>int</b> <b>percent)</b>

           This  function  creates  a  waveform  like <b>wave_create</b> but pads the consumed resources. Where percent
           gives the percentage of the resources to use (in terms of the theoretical maximum,  not  the  current
           amount free). This allows the reuse
           of deleted waves while a transmission is active.

           pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           percent: 0-100, size of waveform as percentage of maximum available.

           The data provided by the <b>wave_add_*</b> functions are consumed by this function.

           As many waveforms may be created as there is space available. The wave id is passed to <b>wave_send_*</b> to
           specify the waveform to transmit.

           A  usage would be the creation of two waves where one is filled while the other is being transmitted.
           Each wave is assigned 50% of the  resources.   This  buffer  structure  allows  the  transmission  of
           infinite wave sequences.

           Normal usage:

           Step 1. <b>wave_clear</b> to clear all waveforms and added data.

           Step 2. <b>wave_add_*</b> calls to supply the waveform data.

           Step 3. <b>wave_create_and_pad</b> to create a waveform of uniform size.

           Step 4. <b>wave_send_*</b> with the id of the waveform to transmit.

           Repeat steps 2-4 as needed.

           Step 5. Any wave id can now be deleted and another wave of the same size
                   can be created in its place.

           Returns  the  new waveform id if OK, otherwise PI_EMPTY_WAVEFORM, PI_NO_WAVEFORM_ID, PI_TOO_MANY_CBS,
           or PI_TOO_MANY_OOL.

       <b>int</b> <b>wave_delete(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>wave_id)</b>

           This function deletes the waveform with id wave_id.

                pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           wave_id: &gt;=0, as returned by <b>wave_create</b>.

           Wave ids are allocated in order, 0, 1, 2, etc.

           The wave is flagged for deletion.  The resources used by the wave will only be reused when either  of
           the following apply.

           - all waves with higher numbered wave ids have been deleted or have been flagged for deletion.

           -  a  new wave is created which uses exactly the same resources as the current wave (see the C source
           for gpioWaveCreate for details).

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_WAVE_ID.

       <b>int</b> <b>wave_send_once(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>wave_id)</b>

           This function transmits the waveform with id wave_id.  The waveform is sent once.

           NOTE: Any hardware PWM started by <b>hardware_PWM</b> will be cancelled.

                pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           wave_id: &gt;=0, as returned by <b>wave_create</b>.

           Returns the number of DMA control  blocks  in  the  waveform  if  OK,  otherwise  PI_BAD_WAVE_ID,  or
           PI_BAD_WAVE_MODE.

       <b>int</b> <b>wave_send_repeat(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>wave_id)</b>

           This function transmits the waveform with id wave_id.  The waveform cycles until cancelled (either by
           the sending of a new waveform or by <b>wave_tx_stop</b>).

           NOTE: Any hardware PWM started by <b>hardware_PWM</b> will be cancelled.

                pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).

       <b>int</b> <b>wave_send_using_mode(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>wave_id,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>mode)</b>

           Transmits the waveform with id wave_id using mode mode.

              mode: PI_WAVE_MODE_ONE_SHOT, PI_WAVE_MODE_REPEAT,
                    PI_WAVE_MODE_ONE_SHOT_SYNC, or PI_WAVE_MODE_REPEAT_SYNC.

           PI_WAVE_MODE_ONE_SHOT: same as <b>wave_send_once</b>.

           PI_WAVE_MODE_REPEAT same as <b>wave_send_repeat</b>.

           PI_WAVE_MODE_ONE_SHOT_SYNC same as <b>wave_send_once</b> but tries to sync with the previous waveform.

           PI_WAVE_MODE_REPEAT_SYNC same as <b>wave_send_repeat</b> but tries to sync with the previous waveform.

           WARNING: bad things may happen if you delete the previous waveform before it has been synced  to  the
           new waveform.

           NOTE: Any hardware PWM started by <b>hardware_PWM</b> will be cancelled.

           Returns  the  number  of  DMA  control  blocks  in  the  waveform if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_WAVE_ID, or
           PI_BAD_WAVE_MODE.

       <b>int</b> <b>wave_chain(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>char</b> <b>*buf,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>bufSize)</b>

           This function transmits a chain of waveforms.

           NOTE: Any hardware PWM started by <b>hardware_PWM</b> will be cancelled.

           The waves to be transmitted are specified by the contents of buf which contains an  ordered  list  of
           <b>wave_id</b>s and optional command codes and related data.

                pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
               buf: pointer to the wave_ids and optional command codes
           bufSize: the number of bytes in buf

           Returns  0 if OK, otherwise PI_CHAIN_NESTING, PI_CHAIN_LOOP_CNT, PI_BAD_CHAIN_LOOP, PI_BAD_CHAIN_CMD,
           PI_CHAIN_COUNTER, PI_BAD_CHAIN_DELAY, PI_CHAIN_TOO_BIG, or PI_BAD_WAVE_ID.

           Each wave is transmitted in the order specified.  A wave may occur multiple times per chain.

           A blocks of waves may be transmitted multiple  times  by  using  the  loop  commands.  The  block  is
           bracketed by loop start and end commands.  Loops may be nested.

           Delays between waves may be added with the delay command.

           The following command codes are supported:

           Name           Cmd &amp; Data   Meaning
           Loop Start     255 0        Identify start of a wave block
           Loop Repeat    255 1 x y    loop x + y*256 times
           Delay          255 2 x y    delay x + y*256 microseconds
           Loop Forever   255 3        loop forever

           If present Loop Forever must be the last entry in the chain.

           The code is currently dimensioned to support a chain with roughly 600 entries and 20 loop counters.

           A is 0 for the main SPI, 1 for the auxiliary SPI.

           W is 0 if the device is not 3-wire, 1 if the device is 3-wire.  Main SPI only.

           nnnn defines the number of bytes (0-15) to write before switching the MOSI line to MISO to read data.
           This field is ignored if W is not set.  Main SPI only.

           T is 1 if the least significant bit is transmitted on MOSI first, the default  (0)  shifts  the  most
           significant bit out first.  Auxiliary SPI only.

           R  is  1  if  the  least significant bit is received on MISO first, the default (0) receives the most
           significant bit first.  Auxiliary SPI only.

           bbbbbb defines the word size in bits (0-32).  The default (0) sets 8 bits per  word.   Auxiliary  SPI
           only.

           The  <b>spi_read</b>, <b>spi_write</b>, and <b>spi_xfer</b> functions transfer data packed into 1, 2, or 4 bytes according
           to the word size in bits.

           For bits 1-8 there will be one byte per character.
           For bits 9-16 there will be two bytes per character.
           For bits 17-32 there will be four bytes per character.

           Multi-byte transfers are made in least significant byte first order.

           E.g. to transfer 32 11-bit words buf should contain 64 bytes and count should be 64.

           E.g. to transfer the 14 bit value 0x1ABC send the bytes 0xBC followed by 0x1A.

           The other bits in flags should be set to zero.

           PI_FILE_OPEN_FAILED, or PI_FILE_IS_A_DIR.

           File

           A file may only be opened if permission is granted  by  an  entry  in  /opt/pigpio/access.   This  is
           intended to allow remote access to files in a more or less controlled manner.

           Each  entry  in /opt/pigpio/access takes the form of a file path which may contain wildcards followed
           by a single letter permission.  The permission may be R for read, W for write, U for read/write,  and
           N for no access.

           Where  more than one entry matches a file the most specific rule applies.  If no entry matches a file
           then access is denied.

           Suppose /opt/pigpio/access contains the following entries

           <a href="file:/home/">/home/</a>* n
           /home/pi/shared/dir_1/* w
           /home/pi/shared/dir_2/* r
           /home/pi/shared/dir_3/* u
           /home/pi/shared/dir_1/file.txt n

           Files may be written in directory dir_1 with the exception of file.txt.

           Files may be read in directory dir_2.

           Files may be read and written in directory dir_3.

           If a directory allows read, write, or read/write access then files may be created in that directory.

           In an attempt to prevent risky permissions the following paths are ignored in /opt/pigpio/access.

           a path containing ..
           a path containing only wildcards (*?)
           a path containing less than two non-wildcard parts

           Mode

           The mode may have the following values.

           Macro           Value   Meaning
           PI_FILE_READ      1     open file for reading
           PI_FILE_WRITE     2     open file for writing
           PI_FILE_RW        3     open file for reading and writing

           The following values may be or'd into the mode.

           Macro            Value   Meaning
           PI_FILE_APPEND   4       Writes append data to the end of the file
           PI_FILE_CREATE   8       The file is created if it doesn't exist
           PI_FILE_TRUNC    16      The file is truncated

           Newly created files are owned by root with permissions owner read and write.

           The GPIO are sampled at a rate set when the pigpio daemon is started (default 5 us).

           The number of samples per second is given in the following table.

                         samples

           GPIO level changes shorter than the sample rate may be missed.

           The daemon software which generates the callbacks is triggered 1000 times per second.  The  callbacks
           will  be  called once per level change since the last time they were called.  i.e. The callbacks will
           get all level changes but there will be a latency.

           If you want to track the level of more than one GPIO do so by maintaining the state in the  callback.
           Do  not  use  <b>gpio_read</b>.   Remember  the  event that triggered the callback may have happened several
           milliseconds before and the GPIO may have changed level many times since then.

       <b>int</b> <b>bsc_xfer(int</b> <b>pi,</b> <b>bsc_xfer_t</b> <b>*bscxfer)</b>

           This function provides a low-level interface to the SPI/I2C Slave peripheral on the BCM chip.

           This peripheral allows the Pi to act as a hardware slave device on an I2C or SPI bus.

           This is not a bit bang version and as such is OS  timing  independent.  The  bus  timing  is  handled
           directly by the chip.

           The output process is simple. You simply append data to the FIFO buffer on the chip.  This works like
           a queue, you add data to the queue and the master removes it.

           I can't get SPI to work properly.  I tried with a control word of 0x303 and swapped MISO and MOSI.

           The  function sets the BSC mode, writes any data in the transmit buffer to the BSC transmit FIFO, and
           copies any data in the BSC receive FIFO to the receive buffer.

                pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           bscxfer: a structure defining the transfer.

           typedef struct
           {
              uint32_t control;          // Write
              int rxCnt;                 // Read only
              char rxBuf[BSC_FIFO_SIZE]; // Read only
              int txCnt;                 // Write
              char txBuf[BSC_FIFO_SIZE]; // Write
           } bsc_xfer_t;

           To start a transfer set control (see below), copy the bytes to be added to the transmit FIFO (if any)
           to txBuf and set txCnt to the number of copied bytes.

           Upon return rxCnt will be set to the number of received bytes placed in rxBuf.

           The returned function value is the status of the transfer (see below).

           If there was an error the status will be less than zero (and will contain the error code).

           The most significant word of the returned status contains the number of bytes  actually  copied  from
           txBuf  to  the  BSC  transmit  FIFO  (may  be  less  than  requested  if  the  FIFO already contained
           untransmitted data).

           Note that the control word sets the BSC mode.  The BSC will stay  in  that  mode  until  a  different
           control word is sent.

           This function allows the Pi to act as a slave I2C device.

           This function is not available on the BCM2711 (e.g.as used in the Pi4B).

           The data bytes (if any) are written to the BSC transmit FIFO and the bytes in the  BSC  receive  FIFO
           are returned.

                 pi: &gt;=0 (as returned by <b>pigpio_start</b>).
           i2c_addr: 0-0x7F.
            bscxfer: a structure defining the transfer.

              char txBuf[BSC_FIFO_SIZE]; // Write
           } bsc_xfer_t;

           txCnt  is  set  to  the  number  of bytes to be transmitted, possibly zero. The data itself should be
           copied to txBuf.

           Any received data will be written to rxBuf with rxCnt set.

           See <b>bsc_xfer</b> for details of the returned status value.

           If there was an error the status will be less than zero (and will contain the error code).

           Note that an i2c_address of 0 may be used to close the BSC device  and  reassign  the  used  GPIO  as
           inputs.
