       liboping - Library to send ICMPv4/ICMPv6 echo packets to multiple hosts

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is an overview of liboping, a C library to send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to remote hosts and
       measure the time it takes for replies to be received. This method, often simply called "ping", is a
       common way to measure network latency and/or host reachability.

       The goals of this library are to provide the above functionality in a platform and protocol independent
       manner. The interface is simple, object oriented and (hopefully) ANSI-C compliant.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       There are two main types that are used by applications. Both are "opaque types", meaning they are
       structures that are <b>not</b> completely defined in the header file, so you cannot access the structures'
       members. You don't need to, don't do it. These structures are subject to change without notice.

       "pingobj_t"
           A ping-object. You can set specific options for this object, add and remove hosts to/from it and send
           ICMP packets to all associated hosts. This is often called a "handle".

       "pingobj_iter_t"
           An  iterator  over the hosts associated with a "pingobj_t" object. This iterator can be used to query
           more information about a host, for example the hostname, the measured latency  or  the  current  ICMP
           sequence.

       Upon  startup  you  usually  create  one  or  more  "pingobj_t"  objects  and  add  hosts to it using the
       "ping_host_add" method (see below). You periodically send "echo requests" using the  "ping_send"  method,
       iterate  over  all  hosts  using  "ping_iterator_get"  and  "ping_iterator_next".  For each host you call
       "ping_iterator_get_info" to read the current latency and do something with it.

       If an error occurs you can use "ping_get_error" so get information on what failed.

</pre><h4><b>LINKING</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>LIBOPING</b></h4><pre>
       Depending on you platform you don't need any extra  libraries  (e.g.  GNU/Linux)  or  "libsocket"  (using
       "-lsocket")  if  the  "socket"  function  is not in the C-library. The latter is the case for the Solaris
       operating system.

</pre><h4><b>SYMBOL</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       All "official" function or method names are prefixed with "ping_".  Don't  use  any  other  functions  or
       methods. Although no such functions should exist.

</pre><h4><b>THREAD</b> <b>SAFETY</b></h4><pre>
       liboping  has  been  designed  to be as thread safe a possible. However, this has not been tested and may
       need some additional work. Use at your own risk and please report back any problems or success  messages.
       Thank you :)
