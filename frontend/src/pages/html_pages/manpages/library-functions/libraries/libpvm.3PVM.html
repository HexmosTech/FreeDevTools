</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       libpvm3, libfpvm3 - PVM C and Fortran programming libraries

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       All  PVM  applications  must  be  linked  with the libpvm library to allow them to communicate with other
       entities in the PVM system.  The base library (libpvm3.a) is written in C and directly supports C and C++
       applications.  The Fortran library (libfpvm3.a) consists of wrapper functions to convert Fortran  calling
       sequences to C.

       Applications  written  in  C  must  be  linked  with  at  least the base PVM library, libpvm3.a.  Fortran
       applications must be linked with both libfpvm3.a and libpvm3.a.  On some operating systems, PVM  programs
       must be linked with other vendor-provided libraries (containing for example, socket or XDR functions).

       Programs that use group functions must also be linked with libgpvm3.a.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       The libpvm subroutines can be divided into roughly five classes:

       Message Passing
              pvm_bufinfo, pvm_freebuf, pvm_getrbuf, pvm_getsbuf, pvm_initsend, pvm_mcast, pvm_mkbuf, pvm_nrecv,
              pvm_pack,   pvm_precv,   pvm_probe,   pvm_psend,   pvm_recv,   pvm_recvf,  pvm_send,  pvm_sendsig,
              pvm_setmwid, pvm_setrbuf, pvm_setsbuf, pvm_trecv, pvm_unpack

       Task Control
              pvm_exit, pvm_kill, pvm_mytid, pvm_parent, pvm_pstat, pvm_spawn, pvm_tasks

       Group Library Functions
              pvm_barrier,   pvm_bcast,   pvm_gather,   pvm_getinst,   pvm_gettid,   pvm_gsize,   pvm_joingroup,
              pvm_lvgroup, pvm_reduce, pvm_scatter

       Virtual Machine Control
              pvm_addhosts,   pvm_config,   pvm_delhosts,   pvm_halt,   pvm_mstat,  pvm_reg_hoster,  pvm_reg_rm,
              pvm_reg_tasker, pvm_start_pvmd

       Miscellaneous
              pvm_archcode,  pvm_catchout,  pvm_getopt,  pvm_hostsync,   pvm_notify,   pvm_perror,   pvm_setopt,
              pvm_settmask, pvm_tidtohost

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       On  success,  most  libpvm  functions  return  the constant PvmOk.  The following error conditions can be
       returned by libpvm functions:

       PvmAlready
              The requested operation requires exclusive access, and another was already in progress.

       PvmBadMsg
              The received messages has a data format native to another machine,  which  cannot  be  decoded  by
              libpvm.

       PvmBadParam
              A bad parameter was passed to the function.

       PvmBadVersion
              Two PVM components (pvmd and task, two pvmds or two tasks) have incompatible protocol versions and
              cannot interoperate.  Version mismatch

       PvmCantStart
              A  pvmd  could  not be started on the local host, or a slave pvmd could not be started on a remote
              host.

       PvmDSysErr
              Some internal mechanism in the pvmd failed during the requested operation.

       PvmDupEntry
              The class server already has an entry matching the insert request.  [In Version  3.4:  Relaced  by
              PvmExists]

       PvmDupGroup
              The task has already a member of the group it attempted to join.

       PvmDupHost
              An  attempt  was  made  to add the same host to a virtual machine more than once, or to add a host
              already a member of another virtual machine owned by the same user.

       PvmDenied
              Operation is refused due to locking, permissions, etc.

       PvmExists
              There is already an entry matching the insert request.

       PvmHostFail
              A foreign host in the virtual machine failed during the requested operation.

       PvmMismatch
              A parameter does not match a corresponding one.

       PvmNoBuf
              There is no current message buffer to pack or unpack.

       PvmNoData
              The end of a message buffer was reached while trying to unpack data.

       PvmNoEntry
              The class server has no entry matching the lookup request.
              [In Version 3.4: Relaced by PvmNotFound]

       PvmNoFile
              The named executable does not exist.

       PvmNoGroup
              The named group does not exist.

       PvmNoHost
              There is no host in the virtual machine with the given name, or the name could not be resolved  to
              an address.

       PvmNoInst
              The named group has no member with this instance.

       PvmNoMem
              Malloc failed to get memory for libpvm.

       PvmNoParent
              This task has no parent task.

       PvmNoSuchBuf
              There is no message buffer with the given buffer handle.

       PvmNoTask
              No task exists with the given tid.

       PvmNotFound
              No entry matching the lookup request was found.

       PvmNotImpl
              This libpvm function or option is not implemented.

       PvmNotInGroup
              The named group has no such member task.

       PvmNullGroup
              A null group name was passed to a function.

       PvmOutOfRes
              The requested operation could not be completed due to lack of resources.

       PvmOverflow
              A value is too large to be packed or unpacked.

       PvmSysErr
              Libpvm could not contact a pvmd on the local host, or the pvmd failed during an operation.
