</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Introduction to the m17n library.

       <u>API</u> <u>LEVELS</u>

       The API of the m17n library is divided into these five.

       1.  CORE API
       It  provides  basic  modules  to  handle  M-texts.  To  use this API, an application program must include
       &lt;m17n-core.h&gt; and be linked with -lm17n-core.
       2.  SHELL API
       It provides modules for character properties, character set handling, code  conversion,  etc.  They  load
       various  kinds  of data from the database on demand. To use this API, an application program must include
       &lt;m17n.h&gt; and be linked with -lm17n-core -lm17n.
       When you use this API, CORE API is also available.
       3.  FLT API
       It provides modules for text shaping using <b>mdbFLT</b>. To use this API, an application program  must  include
       &lt;m17n.h&gt; and be linked with -lm17n-core -lm17n-flt.
       When you use this API, CORE API is also available.
       4.  GUI API
       It  provides  GUI  modules  such as drawing and inputting M-texts on a graphic device. This API itself is
       independent of graphic devices, but most functions require an argument  <b>MFrame</b>  that  is  created  for  a
       specific  type  of graphic devices. The currently supported graphic devices are null device, the X Window
       System, and image data (gdImagePtr) of the GD library.
       On a frame of a null device, you cannot  draw  text  nor  use  input  methods.  However,  functions  like
       <b>mdraw_glyph_list()</b>, etc. are available.
       On a frame of the X Window System, you can use the whole GUI API.
       On a frame of the GD library, you can use all drawing API but cannot use input methods.
       To  use  this API, an application program must include &lt;m17n-gui.h&gt; and be linked with -lm17n-core -lm17n
       -lm17n-gui.
       When you use this API, CORE, SHELL, and FLT APIs are also available.
       5.  MISC API
       It provides miscellaneous functions to support error handling and debugging.  This  API  cannot  be  used
       standalone;  it  must be used with one or more APIs listed above. To use this API, an application program
       must include &lt;m17n-misc.h&gt; in addition to one of the header files described above.
       See also the section <b><a href="../man1/m17n-config.1.html">m17n-config</a>(1)</b>.
       <u>ENVIRONMENT</u> <u>VARIABLES</u>
       The m17n library pays attention to the following environment variables.
       • M17NDIR
       The name of the directory that contains data of the m17n database. See <b>Database</b> for details.
       • MDEBUG_XXX
       Environment variables whose names start with 'MDEBUG_' control debug information  output.  See  <b>Debugging</b>
       for details.
       <u>API</u> <u>NAMING</u> <u>CONVENTION</u>
       The  m17n  library exports functions, variables, macros, and types. All of them start with the letter 'm'
       or 'M', and are followed by an object name (e.g. 'symbol', 'plist') or a module name (e.g. draw,  input).
       Note that the name of M-text objects start with 'mtext' and not with 'mmtext'.
       • functions -- mobject() or mobject_xxx()
       They  start  with  'm'  and are followed by an object name in lower case. Words are separated by '_'. For
       example, <b>msymbol()</b>, <b>mtext_ref_char()</b>, <b>mdraw_text()</b>.
       • non-symbol variables -- mobject, or mobject_xxx
       The naming convention is the same as functions (e.g. mface_large).
       • symbol variables -- Mname
       Variables of the type MSymbol start with 'M' and are followed by their names. Words are separated by '_'.
       For example, Mlanguage (the name is 'language'), Miso_2022 (the name is 'iso-2022').
       • macros -- MOBJECT_XXX
       They start with 'M' and are followed by an object name in upper case. Words are separated by '_'.
       • types -- MObject or MObjectXxx
       They start with 'M' and are followed by capitalized object names. Words are concatenated directly and  no
       '_' are used. For example, <b>MConverter</b>, <b>MInputDriver</b>.
</pre><h4><b>Macro</b> <b>Definition</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>#define</b> <b>M17NLIB_MAJOR_VERSION</b>
       The <b>M17NLIB_MAJOR_VERSION</b> macro gives the major version number of the m17n library.

   <b>#define</b> <b>M17NLIB_MINOR_VERSION</b>
       The <b>M17NLIB_MINOR_VERSION</b> macro gives the minor version number of the m17n library.

   <b>#define</b> <b>M17NLIB_PATCH_LEVEL</b>
       The <b>M17NLIB_PATCH_LEVEL</b> macro gives the patch level number of the m17n library.

   <b>#define</b> <b>M17NLIB_VERSION_NAME</b>
       The <b>M17NLIB_VERSION_NAME</b> macro gives the version name of the m17n library as a string.

   <b>#define</b> <b>M17N_INIT()</b>
       Initialize  the  m17n  library.  The  macro  <b>M17N_INIT()</b> initializes the m17n library. This macro must be
       called before any m17n functions are used.
       It is safe to call this macro multiple times, but in that case, the macro <b>M17N_FINI()</b> must be called  the
       same times to free the memory.
       If  the initialization was successful, the external variable <b>merror_code</b> is set to 0. Otherwise it is set
       to -1.
       <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b>

           <b>M17N_FINI(),</b> <b>m17n_status()</b>

   <b>#define</b> <b>M17N_FINI()</b>
       Finalize the m17n library. The macro <b>M17N_FINI()</b> finalizes the m17n library. It frees all the memory area
       used by the m17n library. Once this macro is called, no m17n functions should be  used  until  the  macro
       <b>M17N_INIT()</b> is called again.
       If the macro <b>M17N_INIT()</b> was called N times, the Nth call of this macro actually free the memory.
       <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b>

           <b>M17N_INIT(),</b> <b>m17n_status()</b>

</pre><h4><b>Enumeration</b> <b>Type</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>enum</b> <b>M17NStatus</b>
       Enumeration  for  the  status  of  the m17n library. The enum <b>M17NStatus</b> is used as a return value of the
       function <b>m17n_status()</b>.

       <b>Enumerator</b>
       <u>M17N_NOT_INITIALIZED</u>
              No modules is initialized, and all modules are finalized.
       <u>M17N_CORE_INITIALIZED</u>
              Only the modules in CORE API are initialized.
       <u>M17N_SHELL_INITIALIZED</u>
              Only the modules in CORE and SHELL APIs are initialized.
       <u>M17N_GUI_INITIALIZED</u>
              All modules are initialized.
