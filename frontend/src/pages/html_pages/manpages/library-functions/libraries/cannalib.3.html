</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CannaLib_intro — Kana-to-Kanji Conversion Library Intro

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Canna provides the following three libraries:

       -  High-level libraries

          From  application  programs,  high-level  libraries  are  available  without considering Kana-to-Kanji
          Conversion.  Processes such as selecting candidates (including candidate list display) are executed by
          the Kana-to-Kanji Conversion system.  Only fixed character strings are passed to the application.   If
          the Kana-to-Kanji Conversion front end is being used for TTY input, the read (cooked mode) system call
          in  terminal  input  is regarded as a high-level library.  In this case, scanf, which uses it, is also
          regarded as a higo-level library.  The Japanese version of Athena  Widget  (Text  Wideget)  in  the  X
          Window System is a more typical library that is regarded as a high-level library.

       -  User interface libraries

          Responding  to  one-character  or  one-key  input,  user  interface  libraries return various kinds of
          information.  They include the unfixed  character  string,  fixed  character  string,  marked  segment
          position, status dispaly character string, and candidate list character string.  The libraries at this
          level  do  not  provide  the  detailed functions involving dictionary maintenance or learning control.
          There is a little remaining room of divising the display fields  although  rough  lines  for  Japanese
          input  user  interface are restricted.  It is recommended that application interfaces at this level be
          used for an application that desires to obtain keys in raw mode in the TTY.  Also, it  is  recommended
          that  they  be  used for an application that desires to input and display graphics and characters in a
          single window.

       -  Dictionary access libraries

          Dictionary access libraries are used to control dictionary access  or  candidate  selection  directly.
          Kana-to-Kanji  Conversion  libraries  at this level provide various function interfaces.  They include
          starting the use of Kana-to-Kanji Conversion system, converting the reading into Kanji,  changing  the
          splitting  of  sentence-segment, fetching Next or Previous Candidate, controlling dictionary learning,
          and maintaining dictionaries.  Dictionary access libraries are used to construct a user  interface  or
          high-level library.  It is recommended that they not be used by ordinary users.

       Canna provides three header files and three libraries.  Their outlines are listed below:

       -  Header files

          X11/kanji.h       Used to input or output Japanese data with X.

          canna/jrkanji.h   Used to input or output TTY-level Japanese data.

          canna/RK.h        Used to use a dictionary access library.

       -  Libraries

          libXnw            Japanese  version  of  Athena  Widget Xaw.  The application program does not need to
                            consider Kana-to-Kanji Conversion.

          libXn             Used  to  process  Japanese  data  with  X.   When   using   XLookupKanjiString   or
                            XDrawKanjiString, you must link this library.

          libcanna          Kernel for Japanese data input

       Library link and header file include must be done as follows, depending on the function you use:

       -  Athena Widget

          Header file     canna/kanji.h

          Library         libXnw, libXn, libcanna

       -  XDrawKanjiString

          Header file     canna/kanji.h

          Library         libXn

       -  XLookupKanjiString, XKanjiControl

          Header file     canna/kanji.h

          Library         libXn, libcanna

       -  jrKanjiString, jrKanjiControl

          Header file     canna/jrkanji.h

          Library         libcanna

       -  Dictionary access library

          Header file     canna/RK.h

          Library         libcanna

</pre><h4><b>Conversion</b> <b>context</b></h4><pre>
       Canna  enables  you to perform two or more Kana-to-Kanji Conversion processes simultaneously.  Conversion
       contextsare used to control  management  of  the  respective  Kana-to-Kanji  Conversion  processes.   The
       internal data needed for Kana-to-Kanji Conversion is secured in each context.

       The  application  identifies each conversion context by the context number.  It is an integer equal to or
       larger than 0, and used as the first parameter of any Kana-to-Kanji Conversion function.

       Immediately after dictionary access library <a href="../man3/RkInitialize.3.html">RkInitialize</a>(3) initializes Kana-to-Kanji  Conversion,  there
       is  only  the  standard  context, which has the context number 0.  It can be used by any application that
       uses only one context.

</pre><h4><b>Outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>Successive</b> <b>Segment</b> <b>Conversion:</b></h4><pre>
       Successive Segment Conversion analyzes the specified Hiragana string, and splits it into a  few  elements
       called sentence segments, or Bunsetsu.  An example of analysis is shown below:

         ``KANAWOKANJINIHENKANSURU''
         KANAWO        <a href="../man1/KANAWO.1.html">KANAWO</a>(1)     <a href="../man2/KANAWO.2.html">KANAWO</a>(2)
         KANJINI       <a href="../man1/KANJINI.1.html">KANJINI</a>(1)    <a href="../man2/KANJINI.2.html">KANJINI</a>(2)    <a href="../man3/KANJINI.3.html">KANJINI</a>(3)    <a href="../man4/KANJINI.4.html">KANJINI</a>(4)
         HENKANSURU    <a href="../man1/HENKANSURU.1.html">HENKANSURU</a>(1) <a href="../man2/HENKANSURU.2.html">HENKANSURU</a>(2) <a href="../man3/HENKANSURU.3.html">HENKANSURU</a>(3)

       Each function provided by the dictionary access library's Successive Segment Conversion may either modify
       the  result  of this analysis or obtain the analysis information.  It assumes a two-dimensional candidate
       address.

       Segment numbers 0, 1, ..., N-1 are assigned leftward to the N segments  that  have  been  analyzed.   The
       currently marked candidate is called the current candidate.

       For  example,  ``KANAWO'' may be specified as a candidate having Segment Number 0 and Candidate Number 0.
       The library instead assumes current segment and candidate in the context to simplify the parameters.
