       BLT - Introduction to the BLT library
_________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       BLT  is  a  library  of  extensions  to  the  Tk  library.   It  adds  new  commands and variables to the
       application's interpreter.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following commands are added to the interpreter from the BLT library:

       <b>table</b>          A table geometry manager for Tk.   You  specify  window  placements  as  table  row,column
                      positions  and  windows  can also span multiple rows or columns.  It also has many options
                      for setting and/or bounding window sizes.

       <b>graph</b>          A 2D plotting widget.  Plots two variable data in a window with  an  optional  legend  and
                      annotations.    It has of several components; coordinate axes, crosshairs, a legend, and a
                      collection of elements and tags.

       <b>barchart</b>       A barchart widget.  Plots two-variable data as rectangular  bars  in  a  window.   The  x-
                      coordinate  values  designate  the  position  of  the  bar  along the x-axis, while the y-
                      coordinate values designate the magnitude.  The <b>barchart</b> widget has of several components;
                      coordinate axes, crosshairs, a legend, and a collection of elements and tags.

       <b>vector</b>         Creates a vector of floating point values.  The vector's components can be manipulated  in
                      three ways: through a Tcl array variable, a Tcl command, or the C API.

       <b>spline</b>         Computes  a spline fitting a set of data points (x and y vectors) and produces a vector of
                      the interpolated images (y-coordinates) at a given set of x-coordinates.

       <b>bgexec</b>         Like Tcl's <b>exec</b> command, <b>bgexec</b> runs a  pipeline  of  Unix  commands  in  the  background.
                      Unlike  <b>exec</b>, the output of the last process is collected and a global Tcl variable is set
                      upon its completion.  <b>bgexec</b> can be used with <b>tkwait</b> to wait for Unix commands  to  finish
                      while  still  handling  expose  events.   Intermediate  output is also available while the
                      pipeline is active.

       <b>busy</b>           Creates a "busy window" which prevents user-interaction when an application is busy.   The
                      busy  window  also provides an easy way to have temporary busy cursors (such as a watch or
                      hourglass).

       <b>bitmap</b>         Reads and writes bitmaps from Tcl.  New X bitmaps can  be  defined  on-the-fly  from  Tcl,
                      obviating  the  need  to  copy around bitmap files.  Other options query loaded X bitmap's
                      dimensions and data.

       <b>drag&amp;drop</b>      Provides a drag-and-drop facility for Tk.  Information (represented by a token window) can
                      be dragged to and  from  any  Tk  window,  including  those  of  another  Tk  application.
                      <b>drag&amp;drop</b>  acts  as  a  coordinator, directing Tk <b>send</b> commands between (or within) TCL/Tk
                      applications.

       <b>htext</b>          A simple hypertext widget.  Combines text and Tk widgets into a single scroll-able window.
                      Tcl commands can be embedded into text, which are invoked  as  the  text  is  parsed.   In
                      addition,  Tk  widgets  can  be  appended  to the window at the current point in the text.
                      <b>Htext</b> can be also used to create scrolled windows of Tk widgets.

       <b>winop</b>          Raise, lower, map, or, unmap any window.  The raise and lower  functions  are  useful  for
                      stacking windows above or below "busy windows".

       <b>watch</b>          Arranges  for  Tcl  procedures to be called before and/or after the execution of every Tcl
                      command. This command may be used in the logging, profiling, or tracing of Tcl code.

       <b>bltdebug</b>       A simple Tcl command tracing facility useful for debugging Tcl code.   Displays  each  Tcl
                      command  before  and  after  substitution  along  its level in the interpreter on standard
                      error.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following Tcl variables are either set or used by BLT at various times in its execution:

       <b>blt_library</b>    This variable contains the name of a directory containing a library  of  Tcl  scripts  and
                      other  files  related  to  BLT.  Currently, this directory contains the <b>drag&amp;drop</b> protocol
                      scripts and the PostScript prolog used by <b>graph</b> and <b>barchart</b>.  The value of this  variable
                      is  taken from the BLT_LIBRARY environment variable, if one exists, or else from a default
                      value compiled into the <b>BLT</b> library.

       <b>blt_versions</b>   This variable is set in the interpreter for each  application.  It  is  an  array  of  the
                      current  version  numbers for each of the BLT commands in the form <u>major</u>.<u>minor</u>.  <u>Major</u> and
                      <u>minor</u> are integers.  The major version number  increases  in  any  command  that  includes
                      changes  that are not backward compatible (i.e. whenever existing applications and scripts
                      may have to change to work with the new release).  The minor version number increases with
                      each new release of a command, except that it resets to zero whenever  the  major  version
                      number changes.  The array is indexed by the individual command name.

</pre><h4><b>ADDING</b> <b>BLT</b> <b>TO</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>APPLICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       It's  easy  to  add BLT to an existing Tk application.  BLT requires no patches or edits to the Tcl or Tk
       libraries.  To add BLT, simply add the following code snippet to your application's tkAppInit.c file.

              if (Blt_Init(interp) != TCL_OK) {
                  return TCL_ERROR;
              }

       Recompile and link with the BLT library (libBLT.a) and that's it.

       Alternately, you can dynamically load BLT, simply by invoking the command

              package require BLT

       from your Tcl script.
