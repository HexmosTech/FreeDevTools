</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pigpiod_if - A C library to interface to the pigpio daemon.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;pigpiod_if.h&gt;

       gcc -Wall -pthread -o prog prog.c -lpigpiod_if -lrt

        ./prog

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       THIS LIBRARY IS DEPRECATED.  NEW CODE SHOULD BE WRITTEN TO USE THE MORE VERSATILE pigpiod_if2 LIBRARY.

       pigpiod_if is a C library for the Raspberry which allows control of the GPIO via the socket interface to
       the pigpio daemon.

   <b>Features</b>
       o hardware timed PWM on any of GPIO 0-31

       o hardware timed servo pulses on any of GPIO 0-31

       o callbacks when any of GPIO 0-31 change state

       o callbacks at timed intervals

       o reading/writing all of the GPIO in a bank as one operation

       o individually setting GPIO modes, reading and writing

       o notifications when any of GPIO 0-31 change state

       o the construction of output waveforms with microsecond timing

       o rudimentary permission control over GPIO

       o a simple interface to start and stop new threads

       o I2C, SPI, and serial link wrappers

       o creating and running scripts on the pigpio daemon

   <b>GPIO</b>
       ALL GPIO are identified by their Broadcom number.

   <b>Notes</b>
       The PWM and servo pulses are timed using the DMA and PWM/PCM peripherals.

   <b>Usage</b>
       Include &lt;pigpiod_if.h&gt; in your source files.

       Assuming your source is in prog.c use the following command to build

       gcc -Wall -pthread -o prog prog.c -lpigpiod_if -lrt

       to run make sure the pigpio daemon is running

       sudo pigpiod

        ./prog # sudo is not required to run programs linked to pigpiod_if

       For examples see x_pigpiod_if.c within the pigpio archive file.

   <b>Notes</b>
       All the functions which return an int return &lt; 0 on error

           Notes

           If PWM or servo pulses are active on the GPIO they are switched off.

       <b>int</b> <b>set_PWM_dutycycle(unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>dutycycle)</b>

           Start (non-zero dutycycle) or stop (0) PWM pulses on the GPIO.

           user_gpio: 0-31.
           dutycycle: 0-range (range defaults to 255).

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO, PI_BAD_DUTYCYCLE, or PI_NOT_PERMITTED.  Notes

           The <b>set_PWM_range</b> function may be used to change the default range of 255.

       <b>int</b> <b>get_PWM_dutycycle(unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio)</b>

           Return the PWM dutycycle in use on a GPIO.

           user_gpio: 0-31.

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO or PI_NOT_PWM_GPIO.

           For normal PWM the dutycycle will be out of the defined range for the GPIO (see <b>get_PWM_range</b>).

           If a hardware clock is active on the GPIO the reported dutycycle will be 500000 (500k) out of 1000000
           (1M).

           If hardware PWM is active on the GPIO the reported dutycycle will be out of a 1000000 (1M).

           Set the range of PWM values to be used on the GPIO.

           user_gpio: 0-31.
               range: 25-40000.

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO, PI_BAD_DUTYRANGE, or PI_NOT_PERMITTED.

           Notes

           If PWM is currently active on the GPIO its dutycycle will be scaled to reflect the new range.

           The  real range, the number of steps between fully off and fully on for each of the 18 available GPIO
           frequencies is

             25(#1),    50(#2),   100(#3),   125(#4),    200(#5),    250(#6),
            400(#7),   500(#8),   625(#9),   800(#10),  1000(#11),  1250(#12),
           2000(#13), 2500(#14), 4000(#15), 5000(#16), 10000(#17), 20000(#18)

           The real value set by set_PWM_range is (dutycycle * real range) / range.

       <b>int</b> <b>get_PWM_range(unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio)</b>

           Get the range of PWM values being used on the GPIO.

           user_gpio: 0-31.

           Returns the dutycycle range used for the GPIO if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO.

           If a hardware clock or hardware PWM is active on the GPIO the reported range will be 1000000 (1M).

       <b>int</b> <b>get_PWM_real_range(unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio)</b>

           Get the real underlying range of PWM values being used on the GPIO.

           user_gpio: 0-31.

           Returns the real range used for the GPIO if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO.

           If a hardware clock is active on the GPIO the reported real range will be 1000000 (1M).

           If hardware PWM is active on the GPIO the reported real range will be approximately 250M  divided  by
           the set PWM frequency.

       <b>int</b> <b>set_PWM_frequency(unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>frequency)</b>

           Set the frequency (in Hz) of the PWM to be used on the GPIO.

           user_gpio: 0-31.
           frequency: &gt;=0 (Hz).

           Returns the numerically closest frequency if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO or PI_NOT_PERMITTED.

           If PWM is currently active on the GPIO it will be switched off and then back on at the new frequency.

           Each GPIO can be independently set to one of 18 different PWM frequencies.

           The selectable frequencies depend upon the sample rate which may be 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, or 10 microseconds
           (default 5).  The sample rate is set when the pigpio daemon is started.

           The frequencies for each sample rate are:

                                  Hertz

                  1: 40000 20000 10000 8000 5000 4000 2500 2000 1600
                      1250  1000   800  500  400  250  200  100   50

                  2: 20000 10000  5000 4000 2500 2000 1250 1000  800

       <b>int</b> <b>get_PWM_frequency(unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio)</b>

           Get the frequency of PWM being used on the GPIO.

           user_gpio: 0-31.

           For normal PWM the frequency will be that defined for the GPIO by <b>set_PWM_frequency</b>.

           If a hardware clock is active on the GPIO the reported frequency will be that set by <b>hardware_clock</b>.

           If hardware PWM is active on the GPIO the reported frequency will be that set by <b>hardware_PWM</b>.

           Returns the frequency (in hertz) used for the GPIO if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO.

       <b>int</b> <b>set_servo_pulsewidth(unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>pulsewidth)</b>

           Start (500-2500) or stop (0) servo pulses on the GPIO.

            user_gpio: 0-31.
           pulsewidth: 0 (off), 500 (anti-clockwise) - 2500 (clockwise).

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO, PI_BAD_PULSEWIDTH or PI_NOT_PERMITTED.

           The  selected  pulsewidth  will  continue  to  be  transmitted  until changed by a subsequent call to
           set_servo_pulsewidth.

           The pulsewidths supported by servos varies and should probably be determined by experiment.  A  value
           of 1500 should always be safe and represents the mid-point of rotation.

           You can DAMAGE a servo if you command it to move beyond its limits.

           OTHER UPDATE RATES:

           This  function updates servos at 50Hz.  If you wish to use a different update frequency you will have
           to use the PWM functions.

           Update Rate (Hz)     50   100  200  400  500
           1E6/Hz            20000 10000 5000 2500 2000

           Firstly set the desired PWM frequency using <b>set_PWM_frequency</b>.

           Then set the PWM range using <b>set_PWM_range</b> to  1E6/Hz.   Doing  this  allows  you  to  use  units  of
           microseconds when setting the servo pulsewidth.

           E.g. If you want to update a servo connected to GPIO 25 at 400Hz

           set_PWM_frequency(25, 400);
           set_PWM_range(25, 2500);

           Thereafter  use  the  <b>set_PWM_dutycycle</b>  function to move the servo, e.g. set_PWM_dutycycle(25, 1500)
           will set a 1500 us pulse.

       <b>int</b> <b>get_servo_pulsewidth(unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio)</b>

           Return the servo pulsewidth in use on a GPIO.

           user_gpio: 0-31.

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO or PI_NOT_SERVO_GPIO.

       <b>int</b> <b>notify_open(void)</b>

           Get a free notification handle.

           Returns a handle greater than or equal to zero if OK, otherwise PI_NO_HANDLE.

           A notification is a method for being notified of GPIO state changes via a pipe.

           Pipes are only accessible from the local machine so this function serves no purpose if you are  using
           the  library  from a remote machine.  The in-built (socket) notifications provided by <b>callback</b> should
           be used instead.

           Notifications for handle x will be available at the pipe named /dev/pigpiox (where x  is  the  handle
           number).  E.g. if the function returns 15 then the notifications must be read from /dev/pigpio15.

       <b>int</b> <b>notify_begin(unsigned</b> <b>handle,</b> <b>uint32_t</b> <b>bits)</b>

           Start notifications on a previously opened handle.

           handle: 0-31 (as returned by <b>notify_open</b>)
             bits: a mask indicating the GPIO to be notified.

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_HANDLE.

           The notification sends state changes for each GPIO whose corresponding bit in bits is set.

           Each notification occupies 12 bytes in the fifo as follows:

           typedef struct
           {
              uint16_t seqno;
              uint16_t flags;
              uint32_t tick;
              uint32_t level;
           } gpioReport_t;

           seqno: starts at 0 each time the handle is opened and then increments by one for each report.

           flags: two flags are defined, PI_NTFY_FLAGS_WDOG and PI_NTFY_FLAGS_ALIVE.

           PI_NTFY_FLAGS_WDOG,  if  bit  5  is  set  then  bits 0-4 of the flags indicate a GPIO which has had a
           watchdog timeout.

           PI_NTFY_FLAGS_ALIVE, if bit 6 is set this indicates a keep alive signal on  the  pipe/socket  and  is
           sent once a minute in the absence of other notification activity.

           tick: the number of microseconds since system boot.  It wraps around after 1h12m.

           level: indicates the level of each GPIO.  If bit 1&lt;&lt;x is set then GPIO x is high.

       <b>int</b> <b>notify_pause(unsigned</b> <b>handle)</b>

           Pause notifications on a previously opened handle.

           handle: 0-31 (as returned by <b>notify_open</b>)

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_HANDLE.

           Notifications for the handle are suspended until <b>notify_begin</b> is called again.

       <b>int</b> <b>notify_close(unsigned</b> <b>handle)</b>

           Stop notifications on a previously opened handle and release the handle for reuse.

           handle: 0-31 (as returned by <b>notify_open</b>)

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_HANDLE.

       <b>int</b> <b>set_watchdog(unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>timeout)</b>

           Sets a watchdog for a GPIO.

           user_gpio: 0-31.
             timeout: 0-60000.

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO or PI_BAD_WDOG_TIMEOUT.

           The watchdog is nominally in milliseconds.

           Only one watchdog may be registered per GPIO.

           The watchdog may be cancelled by setting timeout to 0.

           Once  a  watchdog  has  been  started callbacks for the GPIO will be triggered every timeout interval
           after the last GPIO activity.

           The callback will receive the special level PI_TIMEOUT.

       <b>int</b> <b>set_glitch_filter(unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>steady)</b>

           Sets a glitch filter on a GPIO.

           Level changes on the GPIO are not reported unless the level has  been  stable  for  at  least  <b>steady</b>
           microseconds.   The  level  is  then  reported.   Level  changes of less than <b>steady</b> microseconds are
           ignored.

           user_gpio: 0-31
              steady: 0-300000

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO, or PI_BAD_FILTER.

           This filter affects the GPIO samples returned to callbacks set  up  with  <b>callback</b>,  <b>callback_ex</b>  and
           <b>wait_for_edge</b>.

           It does not affect levels read by <b>gpio_read</b>, <b>read_bank_1</b>, or <b>read_bank_2</b>.  Each (stable) edge will be
           timestamped <b>steady</b> microseconds after it was first detected.

       <b>int</b> <b>set_noise_filter(unsigned</b> <b>user_gpio,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>steady,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>active)</b>

           Sets a noise filter on a GPIO.

           Level  changes on the GPIO are ignored until a level which has been stable for <b>steady</b> microseconds is
           detected.  Level changes on the GPIO are then  reported  for  <b>active</b>  microseconds  after  which  the
           process repeats.

           user_gpio: 0-31
              steady: 0-300000
              active: 0-1000000

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO, or PI_BAD_FILTER.

           This  filter  affects  the  GPIO  samples returned to callbacks set up with <b>callback</b>, <b>callback_ex</b> and
           <b>wait_for_edge</b>.

           It does not affect levels read by <b>gpio_read</b>, <b>read_bank_1</b>, or <b>read_bank_2</b>.

           Level changes before and after the active period may be reported.  Your software must be designed  to
           cope with such reports.

       <b>uint32_t</b> <b>read_bank_1(void)</b>

           Read the levels of the bank 1 GPIO (GPIO 0-31).

           The returned 32 bit integer has a bit set if the corresponding GPIO is logic 1.  GPIO n has bit value
           (1&lt;&lt;n).

       <b>uint32_t</b> <b>read_bank_2(void)</b>

           Read the levels of the bank 2 GPIO (GPIO 32-53).

           The returned 32 bit integer has a bit set if the corresponding GPIO is logic 1.  GPIO n has bit value
           (1&lt;&lt;(n-32)).

           Clears GPIO 0-31 if the corresponding bit in bits is set.

           bits: a bit mask with 1 set if the corresponding GPIO is
                 to be cleared.

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_SOME_PERMITTED.

           A  status  of PI_SOME_PERMITTED indicates that the user is not allowed to write to one or more of the
           GPIO.

       <b>int</b> <b>clear_bank_2(uint32_t</b> <b>bits)</b>

           Clears GPIO 32-53 if the corresponding bit (0-21) in bits is set.

       <b>int</b> <b>hardware_clock(unsigned</b> <b>gpio,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>clkfreq)</b>

           Starts  a  hardware clock on a GPIO at the specified frequency.  Frequencies above 30MHz are unlikely
           to work.

                gpio: see description
           frequency: 0 (off) or 4689-250000000 (250M)

           Returns 0 if  OK,  otherwise  PI_NOT_PERMITTED,  PI_BAD_GPIO,  PI_NOT_HCLK_GPIO,  PI_BAD_HCLK_FREQ,or
           PI_BAD_HCLK_PASS.

           The  same clock is available on multiple GPIO.  The latest frequency setting will be used by all GPIO
           which share a clock.

           The GPIO must be one of the following.

           4   clock 0  All models

           44  clock 1  Compute module only (reserved for system use)

           Access to clock 1 is protected by a password as its use will likely crash the Pi.   The  password  is
           given by or'ing 0x5A000000 with the GPIO number.

       <b>int</b> <b>hardware_PWM(unsigned</b> <b>gpio,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>PWMfreq,</b> <b>uint32_t</b> <b>PWMduty)</b>

           Starts  hardware PWM on a GPIO at the specified frequency and dutycycle.  Frequencies above 30MHz are
           unlikely to work.

           NOTE: Any waveform started by <b>wave_send_once</b>, <b>wave_send_repeat</b>, or <b>wave_chain</b> will be cancelled.

           This function is only valid if the pigpio main clock is PCM.  The main clock defaults to PCM but  may
           be overridden when the pigpio daemon is started (option -t).

       <b>uint32_t</b> <b>get_current_tick(void)</b>

           Gets the current system tick.

           Tick is the number of microseconds since system boot.

           As  tick  is  an  unsigned  32  bit  quantity  it  wraps  around  after  2**32 microseconds, which is
           approximately 1 hour 12 minutes.

       <b>uint32_t</b> <b>get_hardware_revision(void)</b>

           Get the Pi's hardware revision number.

           The hardware revision is the last few characters on the Revision line of /proc/cpuinfo.

           If the hardware revision can not be found or is not a valid hexadecimal number the  function  returns
           0.

           The revision number can be used to determine the assignment of GPIO to pins (see <b>gpio</b>).

           There are at least three types of board.

           Type 1 boards have hardware revision numbers of 2 and 3.

           Type 2 boards have hardware revision numbers of 4, 5, 6, and 15.

           Returns 0 if OK.

       <b>int</b> <b>wave_add_new(void)</b>

           This function starts a new empty waveform.  You wouldn't normally need to call this function as it is

              pulses: an array of pulses.

           Returns the new total number of pulses in the current waveform if OK, otherwise PI_TOO_MANY_PULSES.

           The pulses are interleaved in time order within the existing waveform (if any).

           Merging  allows  the waveform to be built in parts, that is the settings for GPIO#1 can be added, and
           then GPIO#2 etc.

           If the added waveform is intended to start after or within the existing waveform then the first pulse
           should consist solely of a delay.

           NOTES:

           The serial data is formatted as one start bit, <b>data_bits</b> data bits, and <b>stop_bits</b>/2 stop bits.

           It is legal to add serial data streams with different baud rates to the same waveform.

           <b>numBytes</b> is the number of bytes of data in str.

           The bytes required for each character depend upon <b>data_bits</b>.

           For <b>data_bits</b> 1-8 there will be one byte per character.
           For <b>data_bits</b> 9-16 there will be two bytes per character.

           PI_EMPTY_WAVEFORM, PI_TOO_MANY_CBS, PI_TOO_MANY_OOL, or PI_NO_WAVEFORM_ID.

           The data provided by the <b>wave_add_*</b> functions is consumed by this function.

           As many waveforms may be created as there is space available.  The wave id is passed  to  <b>wave_send_*</b>
           to specify the waveform to transmit.

           Normal usage would be

           Step 2. <b>wave_add_*</b> calls to supply the waveform data.

           Step 3. <b>wave_create</b> to create the waveform and get a unique id

           Repeat steps 2 and 3 as needed.

           Step 4. <b>wave_send_*</b> with the id of the waveform to transmit.

           A waveform comprises one or more pulses.  Each pulse consists of a <b>gpioPulse_t</b> structure.

           typedef struct
           {
              uint32_t gpioOn;
              uint32_t gpioOff;
              uint32_t usDelay;
           } gpioPulse_t;

           The fields specify

           1) the GPIO to be switched on at the start of the pulse.
           2) the GPIO to be switched off at the start of the pulse.
           3) the delay in microseconds before the next pulse.

           Any  or  all  the  fields  can be zero.  It doesn't make any sense to set all the fields to zero (the
           pulse will be ignored).

           When a waveform is started each pulse is executed in order with the specified delay between the pulse
           and the next.

           Returns the new waveform id if OK, otherwise PI_EMPTY_WAVEFORM,  PI_NO_WAVEFORM_ID,  PI_TOO_MANY_CBS,
           or PI_TOO_MANY_OOL.

       <b>int</b> <b>wave_delete(unsigned</b> <b>wave_id)</b>

           This function deletes the waveform with id wave_id.

           wave_id: &gt;=0, as returned by <b>wave_create</b>.

           Wave ids are allocated in order, 0, 1, 2, etc.

           The  wave is flagged for deletion.  The resources used by the wave will only be reused when either of
           the following apply.

           - all waves with higher numbered wave ids have been deleted or have been flagged for deletion.

           - a new wave is created which uses exactly the same resources as the current wave (see the  C  source
           for gpioWaveCreate for details).

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_WAVE_ID.

       <b>int</b> <b>wave_send_once(unsigned</b> <b>wave_id)</b>

           This function transmits the waveform with id wave_id.  The waveform is sent once.

           NOTE: Any hardware PWM started by <b>hardware_PWM</b> will be cancelled.

           wave_id: &gt;=0, as returned by <b>wave_create</b>.

           Returns  the  number  of  DMA  control  blocks  in  the  waveform if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_WAVE_ID, or
           PI_BAD_WAVE_MODE.

       <b>int</b> <b>wave_send_repeat(unsigned</b> <b>wave_id)</b>

           This function transmits the waveform with id wave_id.  The waveform cycles until cancelled (either by
           the sending of a new waveform or by <b>wave_tx_stop</b>).

           NOTE: Any hardware PWM started by <b>hardware_PWM</b> will be cancelled.

           wave_id: &gt;=0, as returned by <b>wave_create</b>.

           Returns the number of DMA control  blocks  in  the  waveform  if  OK,  otherwise  PI_BAD_WAVE_ID,  or
           PI_BAD_WAVE_MODE.

       <b>int</b> <b>wave_chain(char</b> <b>*buf,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>bufSize)</b>

           This function transmits a chain of waveforms.

           NOTE: Any hardware PWM started by <b>hardware_PWM</b> will be cancelled.

           The  waves  to  be transmitted are specified by the contents of buf which contains an ordered list of
           <b>wave_id</b>s and optional command codes and related data.

               buf: pointer to the wave_ids and optional command codes
           bufSize: the number of bytes in buf

           Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_CHAIN_NESTING, PI_CHAIN_LOOP_CNT, PI_BAD_CHAIN_LOOP,  PI_BAD_CHAIN_CMD,
           PI_CHAIN_COUNTER, PI_BAD_CHAIN_DELAY, PI_CHAIN_TOO_BIG, or PI_BAD_WAVE_ID.

           Each wave is transmitted in the order specified.  A wave may occur multiple times per chain.

           A  blocks  of  waves  may  be  transmitted  multiple  times  by using the loop commands. The block is
           bracketed by loop start and end commands.  Loops may be nested.

           Delays between waves may be added with the delay command.

           The following command codes are supported:

           Name           Cmd &amp; Data   Meaning
           Loop Start     255 0        Identify start of a wave block
           Loop Repeat    255 1 x y    loop x + y*256 times
           Delay          255 2 x y    delay x + y*256 microseconds
           Loop Forever   255 3        loop forever

           If present Loop Forever must be the last entry in the chain.

           The code is currently dimensioned to support a chain with roughly 600 entries and 20 loop counters.

           px is 0 if CEx is active low (default) and 1 for active high.

           ux is 0 if the CEx GPIO is reserved for SPI (default) and 1 otherwise.

           A is 0 for the main SPI, 1 for the auxiliary SPI.

           W is 0 if the device is not 3-wire, 1 if the device is 3-wire.  Main SPI only.

           nnnn defines the number of bytes (0-15) to write before switching the MOSI line to MISO to read data.
           This field is ignored if W is not set.  Main SPI only.

           T  is  1  if  the least significant bit is transmitted on MOSI first, the default (0) shifts the most
           significant bit out first.  Auxiliary SPI only.

           R is 1 if the least significant bit is received on MISO first, the  default  (0)  receives  the  most
           significant bit first.  Auxiliary SPI only.

           bbbbbb  defines  the  word size in bits (0-32).  The default (0) sets 8 bits per word.  Auxiliary SPI
           only.

           The <b>spi_read</b>, <b>spi_write</b>, and <b>spi_xfer</b> functions transfer data packed into 1, 2, or 4 bytes  according
           to the word size in bits.

           For bits 1-8 there will be one byte per word.
           For bits 9-16 there will be two bytes per word.
           For bits 17-32 there will be four bytes per word.

           Multi-byte transfers are made in least significant byte first order.

           E.g. to transfer 32 11-bit words buf should contain 64 bytes and count should be 64.

           E.g. to transfer the 14 bit value 0x1ABC send the bytes 0xBC followed by 0x1A.

           The other bits in flags should be set to zero.
