</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Specio::Library::Perl - Implements type constraint objects for some common Perl language things

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.50

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This library provides some additional string types for common cases.

   <b>PackageName</b>
       A valid package name. Unlike the "ClassName" constraint from the Specio::Library::Builtins library, this
       package does not need to be loaded.

       This type does allow Unicode characters.

   <b>ModuleName</b>
       Same as "PackageName".

   <b>DistName</b>
       A valid distribution name like "DBD-Pg" Basically this is the same as a package name with the double-
       colons replaced by dashes. Note that there are some historical distribution names that don't fit this
       pattern, like "CGI.pm".

       This type does allow Unicode characters.

   <b>Identifier</b>
       An Identifier is something that could be used as a symbol name or other identifier (filehandle, directory
       handle, subroutine name, format name, or label). It's what you put after the sigil (dollar sign, at sign,
       percent sign) in a variable name. Generally, it's a bunch of word characters not starting with a digit.

       This type does allow Unicode characters.

   <b>SafeIdentifier</b>
       This is just like an "Identifier" but it excludes the single-character variables underscore ("_"), "a"&lt;
       and "b", as these are special variables to the Perl interpreter.

   <b>LaxVersionStr</b> <b>and</b> <b>StrictVersionStr</b>
       Lax and strict version strings use the is_lax and is_strict methods from "version" to check if the given
       string would be a valid lax or strict version. version::Internals covers the details but basically: lax
       versions are everything you may do, and strict omit many of the usages best avoided.

   <b>CREDITS</b>
       Much of the code and docs for this library comes from MooseX::Types::Perl, written by Ricardo SIGNES
