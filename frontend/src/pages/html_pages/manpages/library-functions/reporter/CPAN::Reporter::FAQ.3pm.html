</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPAN::Reporter::FAQ - Answers and tips for using CPAN::Reporter

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.2020

</pre><h4><b>REPORT</b> <b>GRADES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>receive</b> <b>a</b> <b>report?</b>
       Historically, CPAN Testers was designed to have each tester send a copy of reports to authors.  This
       philosophy changed in September 2008 and CPAN Testers tools were updated to no longer copy authors, but
       some testers may still be using an older version.

   <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>sent</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>prerequisite</b> <b>is</b> <b>missing?</b>
       As of CPAN::Reporter 0.46, FAIL and UNKNOWN reports with unsatisfied prerequisites are discarded.
       Earlier versions may have sent these reports out by mistake as either an NA or UNKNOWN report.

       PASS reports are not discarded because it may be useful to know when tests passed despite a missing
       prerequisite.  NA reports are sent because information about the lack of support for a platform is
       relevant regardless of prerequisites.

</pre><h4><b>SENDING</b> <b>REPORTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> <b>report?</b>
       Historically, test reports were sent via ordinary email.  The most common reason for errors sending a
       report back then was that many Internet Service Providers (ISP's) would block outbound SMTP (email)
       connections as part of their efforts to fight spam.

       Since 2010, test reports are sent to the CPAN Testers Metabase over HTTPS. The most common reason for
       failures are systems which upgraded CPAN::Reporter but are still configured to use the deprecated and
       unsupported email system instead of Metabase for transport.

       If you are unsure which transport mechanism you're using, look for the "transport" rule in the
       ".cpanreporter/config.ini" file, in the user's home directory.  See CPAN::Reporter::Config for details on
       how to set the "transport" option for Metabase.

       Other errors could be caused by the absence of the ".cpanreporter/metabase_id.json" file in the user's
       home directory. This file should be manually created prior to sending any reports, via the
       "metabase-profile" program. Simply run it and fill in the information accordingly, and it will create the
       "metabase_id.json" file for you. Move that file to your ".cpanreporter" directory and you're all set.

       If you experience intermittent network issues, you can set the 'retry_submission' option to make a second
       attempt at sending the report a few seconds later, in case the first one fails. This could be useful for
       extremely slow connections.

       Finally, lack of Internet connection or firewall filtering will prevent the report from reaching the CPAN
       Testers servers. If you are experiencing HTTPS issues or messages complaining about SSL modules, try
       installing the LWP::Protocol::https module and trying again. If all fails, you may still change the
       transport uri to use HTTP instead of HTTPS, though this is <u>not</u> recommended.

   <b>Why</b> <b>didn't</b> <b>my</b> <b>test</b> <b>report</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>CPAN</b> <b>Testers?</b>
       There is a delay between the time reports are sent to the Metabase and when they they appear on the CPAN
       Testers website. There is a further delay before summary statistics appear on search.cpan.org.  If your
       reports do not appear after 24 hours, please contact the cpan-testers-discuss email list
       (&lt;<a href="http://lists.perl.org/list/cpan-testers-discuss.html">http://lists.perl.org/list/cpan-testers-discuss.html</a>&gt;) or join the "#cpantesters-discuss" IRC channel
       on "irc.perl.org".

</pre><h4><b>CPAN</b> <b>TESTERS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Where</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>CPAN</b> <b>Testers?</b>
       A good place to start is the CPAN Testers Wiki: &lt;<a href="http://wiki.cpantesters.org/">http://wiki.cpantesters.org/</a>&gt;

   <b>Where</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>statistics</b> <b>about</b> <b>reports</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>CPAN</b> <b>Testers?</b>
       CPAN Testers statistics are compiled at &lt;<a href="http://stats.cpantesters.org/">http://stats.cpantesters.org/</a>&gt;

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>test</b> <b>reports?</b>
       To get credit in the statistics, use the same Metabase profile file and the same email address wherever
       you run tests.
