</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPAN::Reporter::Smoker - Turnkey CPAN Testers smoking

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.30

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
            $ perl -MCPAN::Reporter::Smoker -e start

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Rudimentary smoke tester for CPAN Testers, built upon CPAN::Reporter.  Use at your own risk.  It requires
       a recent version of CPAN::Reporter to run.

       Currently, CPAN::Reporter::Smoker requires zero independent configuration; instead it uses configuration
       settings from CPAN.pm and CPAN::Reporter.

       Once started, it retrieves a list of distributions from the configured CPAN mirror and begins testing
       them in reverse order of upload.  It will skip any distribution which has already had a report sent by
       CPAN::Reporter.

       Features (or bugs, depending on your point of view):

       •   No configuration needed

       •   Tests  each  distribution  as  a  separate  CPAN  process -- each distribution has prerequisites like
           build_requires satisfied from scratch

       •   Automatically checks for new distributions every twelve hours or as otherwise specified

       •   Continues until interrupted with CTRL-C

       •   Checks CPAN.pm "distroprefs" to see if distributions should be skipped (before handing off to CPAN)

       Current limitations:

       •   Does not attempt to retest distributions that had reports discarded  because  of  prerequisites  that
           could not be satisfied

       •   Does not test trial version if there is no non-trial version

   <b>WARNING</b> <b>--</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> <b>risky</b>
       Smoke  testing  will  download  and run programs that other people have uploaded to CPAN.  These programs
       could do <b>anything</b> to your system, including deleting everything on it.  Do not run CPAN::Reporter::Smoker
       unless you are prepared to take these risks.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>start()</b>
       Starts smoke testing using defaults already in CPAN::Config and CPAN::Reporter's .cpanreporter directory.
       Runs until all distributions are tested or the process is halted with CTRL-C or otherwise killed.

       start() supports several optional arguments:

       •   "clean_cache_after" -- number of distributions that will be tested before checking to see if the CPAN
           build cache needs to be cleaned up (not including any  prerequisites  tested).  Must  be  a  positive
           integer.  Defaults to 100

       •   "list"  --  if  provided, this list of distributions will be tested instead of all of CPAN.  May be a
           reference to an array of distribution names or may be a filename containing one distribution name per
           line.  Distribution names must be of the form 'AUTHOR/Dist-Name-0.00.tar.gz'

       •   "restart_delay" -- number of seconds that must elapse before  restarting  smoke  testing.  This  will
           reload indices to search for new distributions and restart testing from the most recent distribution.
           Must be a positive integer; Defaults to 43200 seconds (12 hours)

       •   "skip_dev_versions" -- if true, unindexed distributions will not be tested.  Valid values are 0 or 1.
           Defaults to 0.

       •   "set_term_title"  --  toggle  for whether the terminal titlebar will be updated with the distribution
           being smoke tested and the starting time of the test. Helps determine if a test  is  hung  and  which
           distribution might be responsible.  Valid values are 0 or 1.  Defaults to 1

       •   "status_file"  -- during testing, the name of the distribution under test and a timestamp are written
           to this file. The file is removed after  the  test  is  complete.   This  helps  identify  a  problem
           distribution  if  testing  hangs  or  crashes  the  computer.  If  the  argument includes a path, all
           directories to the file must exist. Defaults to "smoker-status-$$.txt" in File::Spec-&gt;tmpdir.

       •   "install" -- toggle for whether the distribution should be installed after successful testing. Can be
           useful to avoid prerequisite re-building and growing PERL5LIB for the cost of  disk  space  used  for
           installed modules. Valid values are 0 or 1. Defaults to 0

       •   "reverse"  --  toggle  the order in which releases are tested. When set to 1, testing starts from the
           older release not the most recent one (or the last distribution if --list is provided). Valid  values
           are 0 or 1. Defaults to 0

       •   "random"  -- toggle whether to randomize distribution test order. When set to 1, the list of releases
           is shuffled. Valid values are 0 or 1. Defaults to 0

       •   "force_trust" -- toggle whether to override CPAN's "trust_test_report_history" option. When set to 1,
           "trust_test_report_history" is set to 1.  When set to 0, "trust_test_report_history"  is  left  alone
           and  whatever  the  user  has  configured  for  their  CPAN client is used.  Valid values are 0 or 1.
           Defaults to 0

       •   "reload_history_period" -- after this period in seconds, history of modules smoked will  be  reloaded
           when possible.  Default value 1800 seconds (30 minutes).

</pre><h4><b>HINTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>distributions</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b>
       Only  the  most recently uploaded developer and normal releases will be tested, and only if the developer
       release is newer than the regular release indexed by PAUSE.

       For example, if Foo-Bar-0.01,  Foo-Bar-0.02,  Foo-Bar-0.03_01  and  Foo-Bar-0.03_02  are  on  CPAN,  only
       Foo-Bar-0.02  and  Foo-Bar-0.03_02 will be tested, and in reverse order of when they were uploaded.  Once
       Foo-Bar-0.04 is released and indexed, Foo-Bar-0.03_02 will not longer be tested.

       To avoid testing script or other tarballs, developer distributions included must have a base distribution
       name that resembles a distribution tarball already indexed by PAUSE.  If the first upload of distribution
       to PAUSE is a developer release -- Baz-Bam-0.00_01.tar.gz -- it will not be tested as there is no indexed
       Baz-Bam appearing in CPAN's 02packages.details.txt file.

       Unauthorized tarballs are treated like developer releases and will be tested if they resemble an  indexed
       distribution and are newer than the indexed tarball.

       Perl,  parrot,  kurila,  Pugs  and  similar  distributions will not be tested.  The skip list is based on
       CPAN::Mini and matches as follows:

            qr{(?:
                  /(?:emb|syb|bio)?perl-\d
                | /(?:parrot|ponie|kurila|Perl6-Pugs)-\d
                | /perl-?5\.004
                | /perl_mlb\.zip
            )}xi,

       Bundles and mod_perl distributions will also not be tested, though mod_perl is likely to be requested  as
       a  dependency  by  many  modules.   See  the  next  section  for  how to tell CPAN.pm not to test certain
       dependencies.

   <b>Skipping</b> <b>additional</b> <b>distributions</b>
       If certain distributions hang, crash or otherwise cause trouble, you can use CPAN's "distroprefs"  system
       to  disable  them.   If  a  distribution  is  disabled, it won't be built or tested.  If a distribution's
       dependency is disabled, a failing test is just discarded.

       The first step is configuring a directory for distroprefs files:

            $ cpan
            cpan&gt; o conf init prefs_dir
            cpan&gt; o conf commit

       Next, ensure that either the YAML or YAML::Syck module  is  installed.   (YAML::Syck  is  faster).   Then
       create  a  file  in  the "prefs_dir" directory to hold the list of distributions to disable, e.g. call it
       "disabled.yml"

       In that  file,  you  can  add  blocks  of  YAML  code  to  disable  distributions.   The  match  criteria
       "distribution"   is   a   regex  that  matches  against  the  canonical  name  of  a  distribution,  e.g.
       "AUTHOR/Foo-Bar-3.14.tar.gz".

       Here is a sample file to show you some syntax (don't actually use these, though):

            ---
            comment: "Tests take too long"
            match:
                distribution: "^DAGOLDEN/CPAN-Reporter-\d"
            disabled: 1
            ---
            comment: "Skip Win32 distributions"
            match:
                distribution: "/Win32"
            disabled: 1
            ---
            comment: "Skip distributions by Andy Lester"
            match:
                distribution: "^PETDANCE"
            disabled: 1

       Please note that disabling distributions like this will also disable them for normal, non-smoke usage  of
       CPAN.pm.

       One  distribution that I would recommend either installing up front or else disabling with distroprefs is
       mod_perl, as it is a common requirement for many Apache:: modules but does not (easily)  build  and  test
       under automation.

            ---
            comment: "Don't build mod_perl if required by some other module"
            match:
                distribution: "/mod_perl-\d"
            disabled: 1

       Distroprefs  are  more  powerful  than  this  --  they  can  be  used to automate responses to prompts in
       distributions, set environment variables, specify additional dependencies and so on.  Read the  docs  for
       CPAN.pm for more and look in the "distroprefs" directory in the CPAN distribution tarball for examples.

   <b>Using</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> <b>CPAN::Mini</b> <b>mirror</b>
       Because  distributions  must be retrieved from a CPAN mirror, the smoker may cause heavy network load and
       will repetitively download common build prerequisites.

       An alternative is to use CPAN::Mini to create a local CPAN mirror and to point CPAN's  "urllist"  to  the
       local mirror.

            $ cpan
            cpan&gt; o conf urllist unshift file:///path/to/minicpan
            cpan&gt; o conf commit

       However, CPAN::Reporter::Smoker needs the "find-ls.gz" file, which CPAN::Mini does not mirror by default.
       Add it to a .minicpanrc file in your home directory to include it in your local CPAN mirror.

            also_mirror: indices/find-ls.gz

       Note  that CPAN::Mini does not mirror developer versions.  Therefore, a live, network CPAN Mirror will be
       needed in the urllist to retrieve these.

       Note that CPAN requires the LWP module to be installed to use a local CPAN mirror.

       Alternatively, you might experiment with the alpha-quality release of CPAN::Mini::Devel, which subclasses
       CPAN::Mini  to  retrieve  developer  distributions   (and   find-ls.gz)   using   the   same   logic   as
       CPAN::Reporter::Smoker.

   <b>Timing</b> <b>out</b> <b>hanging</b> <b>tests</b>
       CPAN::Reporter  (since  1.08)  supports a 'command_timeout' configuration option.  Set this option in the
       CPAN::Reporter configuration file to time out tests that hang up or get stuck at a prompt.  Set it  to  a
       high-value  to  avoid  timing  out  a  lengthy  tests  that are still running  -- 1000 or more seconds is
       probably enough.

       Warning -- on Win32, terminating processes via the command_timeout is equivalent  to  SIGKILL  and  could
       cause system instability or later deadlocks

       This option is still considered experimental.

   <b>Avoiding</b> <b>repetitive</b> <b>prerequisite</b> <b>testing</b>
       Because  CPAN::Reporter::Smoker  satisfies  all  requirements  from  scratch,  common  dependencies (e.g.
       Class::Accessor) will be unpacked, built and tested repeatedly.

       As of version 1.92_56, CPAN supports the "trust_test_report_history" config option.  When set, CPAN  will
       check  the  last  test  report  for  a  distribution.  If one is found, the results of that test are used
       instead of running tests again.

            $ cpan
            cpan&gt; o conf init trust_test_report_history
            cpan&gt; o conf commit

   <b>Avoiding</b> <b>repetitive</b> <b>prerequisite</b> <b>builds</b> <b>(EXPERIMENTAL)</b>
       CPAN has a "build_dir_reuse" config option.  When set (and if a YAML module is installed and configured),
       CPAN will attempt to make build directories persistent.  This has the potential to save substantial  time
       and  space  during  smoke  testing.  CPAN::Reporter::Smoker will recognize if this option is set and make
       adjustments to the test process to keep PERL5LIB from growing uncontrollably as the number of  persistent
       directories increases.

       <b>NOTE:</b> Support for "build_dir_reuse" is highly experimental. Wait for at least CPAN version 1.92_62 before
       trying this option.

            $ cpan
            cpan&gt; o conf init build_dir_reuse
            cpan&gt; o conf commit

   <b>Stopping</b> <b>early</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>prerequisite</b> <b>fails</b>
       Normally,  CPAN.pm  continues  testing  a  distribution  even  if  a prerequisite fails to build or fails
       testing.  Some distributions may pass their tests even without a listed prerequisite, but most just  fail
       (and CPAN::Reporter discards failures if prerequisites are not met).

       As  of  version  1.92_57,  CPAN  supports  the "halt_on_failure" config option.  When set, a prerequisite
       failure stops further processing.

            $ cpan
            cpan&gt; o conf init halt_on_failure
            cpan&gt; o conf commit

       However, a disadvantage of halting early is that no DISCARD grade is recorded in the history.   The  next
       time  CPAN::Reporter::Smoker  runs, the distribution will be tested again from scratch.  It may be better
       to let all prerequisites finish so the distribution can fail its test and be flagged with DISCARD  so  it
       will be skipped in the future.

   <b>CPAN</b> <b>cache</b> <b>bloat</b>
       CPAN  will  use  a  lot  of scratch space to download, build and test modules.  Use CPAN's built-in cache
       management configuration to let it purge the cache periodically if you don't want to  do  this  manually.
       When  configured, the cache will be purged on start and after a certain number of distributions have been
       tested as determined by the "clean_cache_after" option for the start() function.

            $ cpan
            cpan&gt; o conf init build_cache scan_cache
            cpan&gt; o conf commit

   <b>CPAN</b> <b>verbosity</b>
       Recent versions of CPAN are verbose by default, but include some lesser known configuration  settings  to
       minimize  this  for  untarring  distributions and for loading support modules.  Setting the verbosity for
       these to 'none' will minimize some of the clutter to the screen as distributions are tested.

            $ cpan
            cpan&gt; o conf init /verbosity/
            cpan&gt; o conf commit

   <b>Saving</b> <b>reports</b> <b>to</b> <b>files</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>sending</b> <b>directly</b>
       In some cases, such as when smoke testing using a development or prerelease toolchain module  like  Test-
       Harness,  it  may  be  preferable  to save reports to files in a directory for review prior to submitting
       them.  To do this, manually set the "transport" option in your CPAN::Reporter  config  file  to  use  the
       Test::Reporter::Transport::File transport.

            transport=File /path/to/directory

       After review, send saved reports using Test::Reporter:

            Test::Reporter-&gt;new()-&gt;read($filename)-&gt;send()

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Automatically sets the following environment variables to true values while running:

       •   "AUTOMATED_TESTING"  --  signal  that tests are being run by an automated smoke testing program (i.e.
           don't expect interactivity)

       •   "PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT" -- accept ExtUtils::MakeMaker <b>prompt()</b> defaults

       •   "PERL_EXTUTILS_AUTOINSTALL" -- set to '--defaultdeps' for default dependencies

       The following environment  variables,  if  set,  will  modify  the  behavior  of  CPAN::Reporter::Smoker.
       Generally, they are only required during the testing of CPAN::Reporter::Smoker

       •   "PERL_CR_SMOKER_RUNONCE"  -- if true, start() will exit after all distributions are tested instead of
           sleeping for the "restart_delay" and then continuing

       •   "PERL_CR_SMOKER_SHORTCUT" -- if true, start() will process arguments (if any) but will return  before
           starting smoke testing; used for testing argument handling by start()
