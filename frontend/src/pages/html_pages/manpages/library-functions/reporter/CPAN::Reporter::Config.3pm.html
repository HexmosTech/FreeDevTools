</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPAN::Reporter::Config - Config file options for CPAN::Reporter

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.2020

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       From the CPAN shell:

         cpan&gt; o conf init test_report

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Default options for CPAN::Reporter are read from a configuration file ".cpanreporter/config.ini" in the
       user's home directory.  (On Win32 platforms, the directory will be located in the user's "Documents"
       directory.)  The location of the configuration directory or file may be specified using environment
       variables instead.

       The configuration file is in "ini" format, with the option name and value separated by an "=" sign

          email_from = "John Doe" &lt;<a href="mailto:johndoe@nowhere.org">johndoe@nowhere.org</a>&gt;
          edit_report = no

       Interactive configuration of email address and common action prompts may be repeated at any time from the
       CPAN shell.

         cpan&gt; o conf init test_report

       If a configuration file does not exist, it will be created the first time interactive configuration is
       performed.

       Subsequent interactive configuration will also include any advanced options that have been added manually
       to the configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Email</b> <b>Address</b> <b>(required)</b>
          email_from = &lt;email address&gt;

       CPAN::Reporter requires users to provide an email address that will be used in the header of the report.

       The email address provided should be a valid address format, e.g.:

         email_from = user@domain
         email_from = John Doe &lt;user@domain&gt;
         email_from = "John Q. Public" &lt;user@domain&gt;

   <b>Transport</b> <b>(required)</b>
          transport = &lt;transport class&gt; [transport args]

       This sets the transport mechanism passed to the transport() method of Test::Reporter. Normally,
       CPAN::Reporter uses 'Metabase' for transport class (i.e. Test::Reporter::Transport::Metabase) and will
       provide a default set of transport arguments.

       Metabase transport arguments are two space-separated key/value pairs:

       •   "uri" -- URI for the Metabase API. Defaults to "https://metabase.cpantesters.org/api/v1/"

       •   "id_file"  -- path to the user's Metabase profile file.  Defaults to "metabase_id.json".  (Assumed to
           be in the ".cpanreporter" directory).

       Prior to sending reports, a user must have a valid profile file at  the  path  specified.   For  Metabase
       transport,  CPAN::Reporter  will  automatically  rewrite  a  relative  "id_file" path as an absolute path
       located in the ".cpanreporter" directory.

       If the specified profile file does not exist, CPAN::Reporter will  offer  to  run  "metabase-profile"  to
       create it.

       For other transport types, see the documentation that comes with your choice of Test::Reporter::Transport
       subclass for the proper way to set the "transport" configuration option.

   <b>Action</b> <b>Prompts</b>
       Several  steps in the generation of a test report are optional.  Configuration options control whether an
       action should be taken automatically or whether CPAN::Reporter should prompt the user for the  action  to
       take.   The  action  to  take  may  be  different  for each report grade.  For example, users may wish to
       customize for which grades they wish to manually review a report before sending it.

       Most users should just accept the default settings until they have some experience as CPAN Testers.

       Valid actions, and their associated meaning, are as follows:

       •   "yes" -- automatic yes

       •   "no" -- automatic no

       •   "ask/no" or just "ask" -- ask each time, but default to no

       •   "ask/yes" -- ask each time, but default to yes

       For "ask" prompts, the default will be used if return is pressed immediately at  the  prompt  or  if  the
       "PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT" environment variable is set to a true value.

       Action  prompt options take one or more space-separated "grade:action" pairs, which are processed left to
       right.

         edit_report = fail:ask/yes pass:no

       An action by itself is taken as a default to be used for any grade which does not have  a  grade-specific
       action.  A default action may also be set by using the word "default" in place of a grade.

         edit_report = ask/no
         edit_report = default:ask/no

       A grade by itself is taken to have the action "yes" for that grade.

         edit_report = default:no fail

       Multiple grades may be specified together by separating them with a slash.

         edit_report = pass:no fail/na/unknown:ask/yes

       The action prompt options included in interactive configuration are:

       •   "edit_report  =  &lt;grade:action&gt;  ..."  --  edit  the  test  report  before  sending?  (default:ask/no
           pass/na:no)

       •   "send_report = &lt;grade:action&gt;  ..."  --  should  test  reports  be  sent  at  all?   (default:ask/yes
           pass/na:yes)

       Note  that if "send_report" is set to "no", CPAN::Reporter will still go through the motions of preparing
       a report, but will discard it rather than send it.

       A better way to disable CPAN::Reporter temporarily is with the CPAN option "test_report":

         cpan&gt; o conf test_report 0

   <b>Mail</b> <b>Server</b> <b>(DEPRECATED)</b>
       CPAN::Reporter used to send mail directly to perl.org mail  servers.  The  "smtp_server"  option  is  now
       deprecated and will be ignored if it exists.

</pre><h4><b>ADVANCED</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These additional options are only necessary in special cases, for example if the default editor cannot be
       found or if reports shouldn't be sent in certain situations or for automated testing, and so on.

       •   "command_timeout"  --  if  greater  than zero and the CPAN config is "inactivity_timeout" is not set,
           then any commands executed by CPAN::Reporter will be halted  after  this  many  seconds;  useful  for
           unattended  smoke  testing  to stop after some amount of time; generally, this should be large -- 900
           seconds or more -- as some distributions'  tests  take  quite  a  long  time  to  run.   On  MSWin32,
           Win32::Job  is  a  needed and trying to kill a process may actually deadlock in some situations -- so
           use at your own risk.

       •   "editor = &lt;editor&gt;" -- editor to use to edit the test report; if not  set,  Test::Reporter  will  use
           environment variables "VISUAL", "EDITOR" or "EDIT" (in that order) to find an editor

       •   "retry_submission"  -- if greater than zero, CPAN::Reporter will try to resend the report after a few
           seconds in case the first attempt fails.

       •   "send_duplicates = &lt;grade:action&gt; ..." -- should duplicates of previous reports be  sent,  regardless
           of "send_report"? (default:no)

       •   "send_PL_report  =  &lt;grade:action&gt;  ..."  -- if defined, used in place of "send_report" during the PL
           phase

       •   "send_make_report = &lt;grade:action&gt; ..." -- if defined, used in place of "send_report" during the make
           phase

       •   "send_test_report = &lt;grade:action&gt; ..." -- if defined, used in place of "send_report" during the test
           phase

       •   "send_skipfile = &lt;skipfile&gt;" -- filename containing regular  expressions  (one  per  line)  to  match
           against  the distribution ID (e.g.  'AUTHOR/Dist-Name-0.01.tar.gz'); the report will not be sent if a
           match is found; non-absolute filename must be in the .cpanreporter config directory;

       If these options are manually added to the configuration file, they will be included (and  preserved)  in
       subsequent interactive configuration.

   <b>Skipfile</b> <b>regular</b> <b>expressions</b>
       Skip  files  are  expected  to  have  one  regular  expression  per  line and will be matched against the
       distribution ID, composed of the author's CPAN ID and the distribution tarball name.

            DAGOLDEN/CPAN-Reporter-1.00.tar.gz

       Lines that begin with a sharp (#)  are  considered  comments  and  will  not  be  matched.   All  regular
       expressions will be matched case insensitive and will not be anchored unless you provide one.

       As  the  format of a distribution ID is "AUTHOR/tarball", anchoring at the start of the line with a caret
       (^) will match the author and with a slash (/) will match the distribution.

            # any distributions by JOHNDOE
            ^JOHNDOE
            # any distributions starting with Win32
            /Win32
            # a particular very specific distribution
            ^JOHNDOE/Foo-Bar-3.14

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>DEBUGGING</b></h4><pre>
       These options are useful for debugging only:

       •   "debug = &lt;boolean&gt;" -- turns debugging on/off

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables may be set to alter the default locations for CPAN::Reporter files:

       •   "PERL_CPAN_REPORTER_DIR" -- if set, this directory is used in place of  the  default  ".cpanreporter"
           directory;  this will affect not only the location of the default "config.ini", but also the location
           of the CPAN::Reporter::History database and any other files that live in that directory

       •   "PERL_CPAN_REPORTER_CONFIG" -- if set, this file is used in place of the default  "config.ini"  file;
           it may be in any directory, regardless of the choice of configuration directory
