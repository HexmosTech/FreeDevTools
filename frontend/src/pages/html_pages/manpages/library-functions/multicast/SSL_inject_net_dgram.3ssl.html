</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SSL_inject_net_dgram - inject a datagram as though received from the network

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

        int SSL_inject_net_dgram(SSL *s, const unsigned char *buf,
                                 size_t buf_len,
                                 const BIO_ADDR *peer,
                                 const BIO_ADDR *local);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This function can be used to inject a datagram payload to a QUIC connection SSL object. The payload is
       processed as though it was received from the network.  This function can be used for debugging purposes
       or to allow datagrams to be fed to QUIC from alternative sources.

       <u>buf</u> is required and must point to a datagram payload to inject. <u>buf_len</u> is the length of the buffer in
       bytes. The buffer is copied and need not remain valid after this function returns.

       <u>peer</u> and <u>local</u> are optional values pointing to <b>BIO_ADDR</b> structures describing the remote and local UDP
       endpoint addresses for the packet. Though the injected packet was not actually received from the network
       directly by OpenSSL, the packet will be processed as though the received datagram had the given
       addresses.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       Returns 1 on success or 0 on failure. This function always fails if called on an SSL object which is not
       a QUIC connection SSL object.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The function <b>SSL_inject_net_dgram()</b> was added in OpenSSL 3.2.
