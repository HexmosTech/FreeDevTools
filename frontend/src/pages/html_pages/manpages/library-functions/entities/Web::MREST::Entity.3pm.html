</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Web::MREST::Entity - Methods for dealing with request, response entities

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Methods for dealing with request, response entities

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>get_acceptable_content_type_handler</b>
       The method to use to process the request entity (i.e, the "acceptable content type handler") is set in
       content_types_accepted. Web::Machine only calls the method on PUT requests and those POST requests for
       which post_is_create is true. On POST requests where post_is_create is false, we have to call it
       ourselves, and for that we need a way to get to it.

   <b>content_types_provided</b>
       Web::Machine calls this routine to determine how to generate the response body GET requests. (It is not
       called for PUT, POST, or DELETE requests.)

       The return value has the following format:

           [
               { 'text/html' =&gt; 'method_for_html' },
               { 'application/json' =&gt; 'method_for_json' },
               { 'other/mime' =&gt; 'method_for_other_mime' },
           ]

       As you can see, this is a list of tuples. The key is a media type and the value is the name of a method.
       The first tuple is taken as the default.

   <b>mrest_generate_response_html</b>
       Normally, clients will communicate with the server via '_render_response_json', but humans need HTML.
       This method takes the server's JSON response and wraps it up in a nice package.  The return value from
       this method becomes the response entity.

   <b>content_types_accepted</b>
       Web::Machine calls this routine to determine how to handle the request body (e.g. in PUT requests).

   <b>mrest_process_request_json</b>
       PUT and POST requests may contain a request body. This is the "handler function" where we process those
       requests.

       We associate this function with 'application/json' via "content_types_accepted".

   <b>mrest_process_request</b>
       Used to call the request handler manually in cases when Web::Machine does not call it for us.

   <b>mrest_generate_response_json</b>
       First, run pass 2 of the resource handler, which is expected to return an App::CELL::Status object.
       Second, push that object onto the context. Third, convert that object into JSON and push the JSON onto
       the context, too. Return the JSON representation of the App::CELL::Status object - this becomes the HTTP
       response entity.

   <b>mrest_generate_response</b>
       This should somehow get the response handler and run it.
