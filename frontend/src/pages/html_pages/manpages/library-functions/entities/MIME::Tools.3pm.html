</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MIME-tools - modules for parsing (and creating!) MIME entities

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Here's some pretty basic code for <b>parsing</b> <b>a</b> <b>MIME</b> <b>message,</b> and outputting its decoded components to a
       given directory:

           use MIME::Parser;

           ### Create parser, and set some parsing options:
           my $parser = new MIME::Parser;
           $parser-&gt;output_under("$ENV{HOME}/mimemail");

           ### Parse input:
           $entity = $parser-&gt;parse(\*STDIN) or die "parse failed\n";

           ### Take a look at the top-level entity (and any parts it has):
           $entity-&gt;dump_skeleton;

       Here's some code which <b>composes</b> <b>and</b> <b>sends</b> <b>a</b> <b>MIME</b> <b>message</b> containing three parts: a text file, an attached
       GIF, and some more text:

           use MIME::Entity;

           ### Create the top-level, and set up the mail headers:
           $top = MIME::Entity-&gt;build(Type    =&gt;"multipart/mixed",
                                      From    =&gt; "me\@myhost.com",
                                      To      =&gt; "you\@yourhost.com",
                                      Subject =&gt; "Hello, nurse!");

           ### Part #1: a simple text document:
           $top-&gt;attach(Path=&gt;"./testin/short.txt");

           ### Part #2: a GIF file:
           $top-&gt;attach(Path        =&gt; "./docs/mime-sm.gif",
                        Type        =&gt; "image/gif",
                        Encoding    =&gt; "base64");

           ### Part #3: some literal text:
           $top-&gt;attach(Data=&gt;$message);

           ### Send it:
           open MAIL, "| /usr/lib/sendmail -t -oi -oem" or die "open: $!";
           $top-&gt;print(\*MAIL);
           close MAIL;

       For more examples, look at the scripts in the <b>examples</b> directory of the MIME-tools distribution.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MIME-tools is a collection of Perl5 MIME:: modules for parsing, decoding, <u>and</u> <u>generating</u> single- or
       multipart (even nested multipart) MIME messages.  (Yes, kids, that means you can send messages with
       attached GIF files).

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       You will need the following installed on your system:

               File::Path
               File::Spec
               IPC::Open2              (optional)
               MIME::Base64
               MIME::QuotedPrint
               Net::SMTP
               Mail::Internet, ...     from the MailTools distribution.

       See the Makefile.PL in your distribution for the most-comprehensive list of prerequisite modules and
       their version numbers.

</pre><h4><b>A</b> <b>QUICK</b> <b>TOUR</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Overview</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classes</b>
       Here are the classes you'll generally be dealing with directly:

           (START HERE)            results() .-----------------.
                 \                 .--------&gt;| MIME::          |
                  .-----------.   /          | Parser::Results |
                  | MIME::    |--'           `-----------------'
                  | Parser    |--.           .-----------------.
                  `-----------'   \ filer()  | MIME::          |
                     | parse()     `--------&gt;| Parser::Filer   |
                     | gives you             `-----------------'
                     | a...                                  | output_path()
                     |                                       | determines
                     |                                       | path() of...
                     |    head()       .--------.            |
                     |    returns...   | MIME:: | get()      |
                     V       .--------&gt;| Head   | etc...     |
                  .--------./          `--------'            |
            .---&gt; | MIME:: |                                 |
            `-----| Entity |           .--------.            |
          parts() `--------'\          | MIME:: |           /
          returns            `--------&gt;| Body   |&lt;---------'
          sub-entities    bodyhandle() `--------'
          (if any)        returns...       | open()
                                           | returns...
                                           |
                                           V
                                       .--------. read()
                                       | IO::   | getline()
                                       | Handle | print()
                                       `--------' etc...

       To illustrate, parsing works this way:

       •   <b>The</b>  <b>"parser"</b>  <b>parses</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>MIME</b>  <b>stream.</b>  A parser is an instance of "MIME::Parser".  You hand it an
           input stream (like a filehandle) to parse a message from: if the parse is successful, the  result  is
           an "entity".

       •   <b>A</b>  <b>parsed</b>  <b>message</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>represented</b>  <b>by</b>  <b>an</b>  <b>"entity".</b>  An entity is an instance of "MIME::Entity" (a
           subclass of "Mail::Internet").  If the message had "parts" (e.g., attachments), then those parts  are
           "entities" as well, contained inside the top-level entity.  Each entity has a "head" and a "body".

       •   <b>The</b>  <b>entity's</b> <b>"head"</b> <b>contains</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>message.</b>  A "head" is an instance of "MIME::Head"
           (a subclass of "Mail::Header").  It contains information  from  the  message  header:  content  type,
           sender, subject line, etc.

       •   <b>The</b>  <b>entity's</b>  <b>"body"</b>  <b>knows</b>  <b>where</b>  <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>data</b> <b>is.</b>  You can ask to "open" this data source for
           <u>reading</u> or <u>writing</u>, and you will get back an "I/O handle".

       •   <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>open()</b> <b>a</b> <b>"body"</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>"I/O</b> <b>handle"</b> <b>to</b> <b>read/write</b> <b>message</b> <b>data.</b>  This handle is an object
           that is basically like an IO::Handle...  it can be any  class,  so  long  as  it  supports  a  small,
           standard set of methods for reading from or writing to the underlying data source.

       A  typical  multipart  message  containing  two parts -- a textual greeting and an "attached" GIF file --
       would be a tree of MIME::Entity objects, each of which would have its own MIME::Head.  Like this:

           .--------.
           | MIME:: | Content-type: multipart/mixed
           | Entity | Subject: Happy Samhaine!
           `--------'
                |
                `----.
               parts |
                     |   .--------.
                     |---| MIME:: | Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
                     |   | Entity | Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit
                     |   `--------'
                     |   .--------.
                     |---| MIME:: | Content-type: image/gif
                         | Entity | Content-transfer-encoding: base64
                         `--------' Content-disposition: inline;
                                      filename="hs.gif"

   <b>Parsing</b> <b>messages</b>
       You usually start by creating an instance of <b>MIME::Parser</b> and setting up certain parsing parameters: what
       directory to save extracted files to, how to name the files, etc.

       You then give that instance a readable filehandle on which waits a MIME message.  If all goes  well,  you
       will get back a <b>MIME::Entity</b> object (a subclass of <b>Mail::Internet</b>), which consists of...

       •   A <b>MIME::Head</b> (a subclass of <b>Mail::Header</b>) which holds the MIME header data.

       •   A  <b>MIME::Body</b>,  which  is  a object that knows where the body data is.  You ask this object to "open"
           itself for reading, and it will hand you back an "I/O handle" for reading the data: this could be  of
           any class, so long as it conforms to a subset of the <b>IO::Handle</b> interface.

       If  the  original message was a multipart document, the MIME::Entity object will have a non-empty list of
       "parts", each of which is in turn a MIME::Entity (which might also be a multipart entity, etc, etc...).

       Internally, the parser (in MIME::Parser) asks for instances of <b>MIME::Decoder</b> whenever it needs to  decode
       an  encoded file.  MIME::Decoder has a mapping from supported encodings (e.g., 'base64') to classes whose
       instances can decode them.  You can add to this mapping to try out  new/experiment  encodings.   You  can
       also use MIME::Decoder by itself.

   <b>Composing</b> <b>messages</b>
       All  message  composition  is done via the <b>MIME::Entity</b> class.  For single-part messages, you can use the
       <b>MIME::Entity/build</b> constructor to create MIME entities very easily.

       For  multipart  messages,  you  can   start   by   creating   a   top-level   "multipart"   entity   with
       <b>MIME::Entity::build()</b>,  and  then  use  the similar <b>MIME::Entity::attach()</b> method to attach parts to that
       message.  <u>Please</u> <u>note:</u> what most people think of as "a text message with an attached GIF file" is  <u>really</u>
       a multipart message with 2 parts: the first being the text message, and the second being the GIF file.

       When building MIME a entity, you'll have to provide two very important pieces of information: the <u>content</u>
       <u>type</u>  and  the  <u>content</u> <u>transfer</u> <u>encoding</u>.  The type is usually easy, as it is directly determined by the
       file format; e.g., an HTML file is "text/html".  The encoding, however, is trickier... for example,  some
       HTML  files  are  "7bit"-compliant,  but  others  might  have  very  long lines and would need to be sent
       "quoted-printable" for reliability.

       See the section on encoding/decoding for more details, as well as "A MIME PRIMER" below.

   <b>Sending</b> <b>email</b>
       Since MIME::Entity  inherits  directly  from  Mail::Internet,  you  can  use  the  normal  Mail::Internet
       mechanisms to send email.  For example,

           $entity-&gt;smtpsend;

   <b>Encoding/decoding</b> <b>support</b>
       The <b>MIME::Decoder</b> class can be used to <u>encode</u> as well; this is done when printing MIME entities.  All the
       standard encodings are supported (see "A MIME PRIMER" below for details):

           Encoding:        | Normally used when message contents are:
           -------------------------------------------------------------------
           7bit             | 7-bit data with under 1000 chars/line, or multipart.
           8bit             | 8-bit data with under 1000 chars/line.
           binary           | 8-bit data with some long lines (or no line breaks).
           quoted-printable | Text files with some 8-bit chars (e.g., Latin-1 text).
           base64           | Binary files.

       Which  encoding you choose for a given document depends largely on (1) what you know about the document's
       contents (text vs binary), and (2) whether you need the resulting message to have a reliable encoding for
       7-bit Internet email transport.

       In general, only "quoted-printable" and "base64" guarantee reliable transport  of  all  data;  the  other
       three  "no-encoding"  encodings  simply pass the data through, and are only reliable if that data is 7bit
       ASCII with under 1000 characters per line, and has no conflicts with the multipart boundaries.

       I've considered making it so that the content-type and encoding can be automatically  inferred  from  the
       file's path, but that seems to be asking for trouble... or at least, for Mail::Cap...

   <b>Message-logging</b>
       MIME-tools  is  a  large  and  complex toolkit which tries to deal with a wide variety of external input.
       It's sometimes helpful to see what's really going on behind the  scenes.   There  are  several  kinds  of
       messages logged by the toolkit itself:

       Debug messages
           These are printed directly to the STDERR, with a prefix of "MIME-tools: debug".

           Debug message are only logged if you have turned "debugging" on in the MIME::Tools configuration.

       Warning messages
           These  are  logged  by the standard Perl <b>warn()</b> mechanism to indicate an unusual situation.  They all
           have a prefix of "MIME-tools: warning".

           Warning messages are only logged if $^W is set true and MIME::Tools is not configured to be "quiet".

       Error messages
           These are logged by the standard Perl <b>warn()</b> mechanism to indicate that  something  actually  failed.
           They all have a prefix of "MIME-tools: error".

           Error messages are only logged if $^W is set true and MIME::Tools is not configured to be "quiet".

       Usage messages
           Unlike  "typical"  warnings  above, which warn about problems processing data, usage-warnings are for
           alerting developers of deprecated methods and suspicious invocations.

           Usage messages are currently only logged if $^W is set true and MIME::Tools is not configured  to  be
           "quiet".

       When  a MIME::Parser (or one of its internal helper classes) wants to report a message, it generally does
       so by recording  the  message  to  the  <b>MIME::Parser::Results</b>  object  immediately  before  invoking  the
       appropriate  function above.  That means each parsing run has its own trace-log which can be examined for
       problems.

   <b>Configuring</b> <b>the</b> <b>toolkit</b>
       If you want to tweak the way this toolkit works (for example, to turn on debugging), use the routines  in
       the <b>MIME::Tools</b> module.

       debugging
           Turn debugging on or off.  Default is false (off).

                MIME::Tools-&gt;<a href="../man1/debugging.1.html">debugging</a>(1);

       quiet
           Turn  the reporting of warning/error messages on or off.  Default is true, meaning that these message
           are silenced.

                MIME::Tools-&gt;<a href="../man1/quiet.1.html">quiet</a>(1);

       version
           Return the toolkit version.

                print MIME::Tools-&gt;version, "\n";

</pre><h4><b>THINGS</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>SHOULD</b> <b>DO</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>examples</b>
       The MIME-Tools distribution comes with an "examples" directory.  The scripts in there are basically  just
       tossed-together, but they'll give you some ideas of how to use the parser.

   <b>Run</b> <b>with</b> <b>warnings</b> <b>enabled</b>
       <u>Always</u>  run your Perl script with "-w".  If you see a warning about a deprecated method, change your code
       ASAP.  This will ease upgrades tremendously.

   <b>Avoid</b> <b>non-standard</b> <b>encodings</b>
       Don't try to MIME-encode using the non-standard MIME encodings.  It's just not a  good  practice  if  you
       want people to be able to read your messages.

   <b>Plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>exceptions</b>
       For example, if your mail-handling code absolutely must not die, then perform mail parsing like this:

           $entity = eval { $parser-&gt;parse(\*INPUT) };

       Parsing  is  a  complex process, and some components may throw exceptions if seriously-bad things happen.
       Since "seriously-bad" is in the eye of the beholder,  you're  better  off  <u>catching</u>  possible  exceptions
       instead  of asking me to propagate "undef" up the stack.  Use of exceptions in reusable modules is one of
       those religious issues we're never all going to agree upon; thankfully, that's what "eval{}" is good for.

   <b>Check</b> <b>the</b> <b>parser</b> <b>results</b> <b>for</b> <b>warnings/errors</b>
       As of 5.3xx, the parser tries extremely hard to give you a MIME::Entity.  If there were any problems,  it
       logs warnings/errors to the underlying "results" object (see MIME::Parser::Results).  Look at that object
       after  each  parse.   Print  out  the warnings and errors, <u>especially</u> if messages don't parse the way you
       thought they would.

   <b>Don't</b> <b>plan</b> <b>on</b> <b>printing</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>parsed!</b>
       <u>Parsing</u> <u>is</u> <u>a</u> <u>(slightly)</u> <u>lossy</u> <u>operation.</u>  Because of things  like  ambiguities  in  base64-encoding,  the
       following is <u>not</u> going to spit out its input unchanged in all cases:

           $entity = $parser-&gt;parse(\*STDIN);
           $entity-&gt;print(\*STDOUT);

       If  you're using MIME::Tools to process email, remember to save the data you parse if you want to send it
       on unchanged.  This is vital for things like PGP-signed email.

   <b>Understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>international</b> <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> <b>represented</b>
       The MIME standard allows for text strings in headers to contain characters from  any  character  set,  by
       using special sequences which look like this:

           =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Keld_J=F8rn_Simonsen?=

       To be consistent with the existing Mail::Field classes, MIME::Tools does <u>not</u> automatically unencode these
       strings, since doing so would lose the character-set information and interfere with the parsing of fields
       (see "decode_headers" in MIME::Parser for a full explanation).  That means you should be prepared to deal
       with these encoded strings.

       The  most common question then is, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>decode</b> <b>these</b> <b>encoded</b> <b>strings?</b>  The answer depends on what you
       want to decode them <u>to</u>: ASCII, Latin1, UTF-8, etc.  Be aware that your "target"  representation  may  not
       support  all  possible character sets you might encounter; for example, Latin1 (ISO-8859-1) has no way of
       representing Big5 (Chinese) characters.  A common practice is to represent  "untranslateable"  characters
       as "?"s, or to ignore them completely.

       To unencode the strings into some of the more-popular Western byte representations (e.g., Latin1, Latin2,
       etc.),  you  can  use  the decoders in MIME::WordDecoder (see MIME::WordDecoder).  The simplest way is by
       using unmime(), a function wrapped around your "default" decoder, as follows:

           use MIME::WordDecoder;
           ...
           $subject = unmime $entity-&gt;head-&gt;get('subject');

       One place this <u>is</u> done automatically is in extracting the recommended filename for a part while  parsing.
       That's  why  you  should  start  by setting up the best "default" decoder if the default target of Latin1
       isn't to your liking.

</pre><h4><b>THINGS</b> <b>I</b> <b>DO</b> <b>THAT</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>SHOULD</b> <b>KNOW</b> <b>ABOUT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Fuzzing</b> <b>of</b> <b>CRLF</b> <b>and</b> <b>newline</b> <b>on</b> <b>input</b>
       RFC 2045 dictates that MIME streams have lines terminated by CRLF ("\r\n").   However,  it  is  extremely
       likely  that  folks  will  want to parse MIME streams where each line ends in the local newline character
       "\n" instead.

       An attempt has been made to allow the parser to handle both CRLF and newline-terminated input.

   <b>Fuzzing</b> <b>of</b> <b>CRLF</b> <b>and</b> <b>newline</b> <b>when</b> <b>decoding</b>
       The "7bit" and "8bit" decoders will decode both a "\n" and a "\r\n" end-of-line sequence into a "\n".

       The "binary" decoder (default if no encoding specified) still outputs stuff verbatim... so a MIME message
       with CRLFs and no explicit encoding will be output as a text file that, on many  systems,  will  have  an
       annoying ^M at the end of each line... <u>but</u> <u>this</u> <u>is</u> <u>as</u> <u>it</u> <u>should</u> <u>be</u>.

   <b>Fuzzing</b> <b>of</b> <b>CRLF</b> <b>and</b> <b>newline</b> <b>when</b> <b>encoding/composing</b>
       TODO FIXME All encoders currently output the end-of-line sequence as a "\n", with the assumption that the
       local  mail agent will perform the conversion from newline to CRLF when sending the mail.  However, there
       probably should be an option to output CRLF as per RFC 2045

   <b>Inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>multipart</b> <b>boundaries</b> <b>with</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>newlines</b>
       Let's get something straight: this is an evil, EVIL practice.  If your mailer creates multipart  boundary
       strings  that  contain  newlines,  give  it  two  weeks  notice and find another one.  If your mail robot
       receives MIME mail like this, regard it as syntactically incorrect, which it is.

   <b>Ignoring</b> <b>non-header</b> <b>headers</b>
       People like to hand the parser raw messages straight from  POP3  or  from  a  mailbox.   There  is  often
       predictable  non-header  information  in  front of the real headers; e.g., the initial "From" line in the
       following message:

           From - Wed Mar 22 02:13:18 2000
           Return-Path: &lt;<a href="mailto:eryq@zeegee.com">eryq@zeegee.com</a>&gt;
           Subject: Hello

       The parser simply ignores such stuff quietly.  Perhaps it shouldn't, but most people seem  to  want  that
       behavior.

   <b>Fuzzing</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>multipart</b> <b>preambles</b>
       Please  note  that  there  is  currently  an ambiguity in the way preambles are parsed in.  The following
       message fragments <u>both</u> are regarded  as  having  an  empty  preamble  (where  "\n"  indicates  a  newline
       character):

            Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary="xyz"\n
            Subject: This message (#1) has an empty preamble\n
            \n
            --xyz\n
            ...

            Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary="xyz"\n
            Subject: This message (#2) also has an empty preamble\n
            \n
            \n
            --xyz\n
            ...

       In both cases, the <u>first</u> completely-empty line (after the "Subject") marks the end of the header.

       But we should clearly ignore the <u>second</u> empty line in message #2, since it fills the role of <u>"the</u> <u>newline</u>
       <u>which</u>  <u>is</u>  <u>only</u>  <u>there</u>  <u>to</u> <u>make</u> <u>sure</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>boundary</u> <u>is</u> <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>beginning</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>line"</u>.  Such newlines are
       <u>never</u> part of the content preceding the boundary; thus, there is no preamble "content" in message #2.

       However, it seems clear that message #1 <u>also</u> has no preamble "content", and is in fact merely  a  compact
       representation of an empty preamble.

   <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>temp</b> <b>file</b> <b>during</b> <b>parsing</b>
       <u>Why</u>  <u>not</u>  <u>do</u>  <u>everything</u>  <u>in</u>  <u>core?</u>   Although  the amount of core available on even a modest home system
       continues to grow, the size of attachments continues to grow with it.  I wanted to make  sure  that  even
       users  with small systems could deal with decoding multi-megabyte sounds and movie files.  That means not
       being core-bound.

       As of the released 5.3xx, MIME::Parser gets by with only one temp file open per parser.  This  temp  file
       provides  a  sort  of  infinite  scratch  space for dealing with the current message part.  It's fast and
       lightweight, but you should know about it anyway.

   <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>MIME</b> <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> <b>email</b> <b>objects?</b>
       Achim Bohnet once pointed out that MIME headers do nothing more than store a  collection  of  attributes,
       and thus could be represented as objects which don't inherit from Mail::Header.

       I  agree  in  principle,  but RFC 2045 says otherwise.  RFC 2045 [MIME] headers are a syntactic subset of
       RFC-822 [email] headers.  Perhaps a better name for these modules would have been  RFC1521::  instead  of
       MIME::, but we're a little beyond that stage now.

       When  I originally wrote these modules for the CPAN, I agonized for a long time about whether or not they
       really should subclass from <b>Mail::Internet</b> (then at version 1.17).  Thanks to Graham Barr, who graciously
       evolved MailTools 1.06 to be more MIME-friendly, unification was achieved at MIME-tools release 2.0.  The
       benefits in reuse alone have been substantial.

</pre><h4><b>A</b> <b>MIME</b> <b>PRIMER</b></h4><pre>
       So you need to parse (or create) MIME, but you're not quite up on the specifics?  No problem...

   <b>Glossary</b>
       Here are some definitions adapted from RFC 1521 (predecessor of the current RFC 204[56789] defining MIME)
       explaining the terminology we use; each is accompanied by the equivalent in MIME:: module terms...

       attachment
           An "attachment" is common slang for any part of a multipart message -- except, perhaps, for the first
           part, which normally carries a user message describing the attachments that follow (e.g.: "Hey  dude,
           here's that GIF file I promised you.").

           In  our  system, an attachment is just a <b>MIME::Entity</b> under the top-level entity, probably one of its
           parts.

       body
           The "body" of an entity is that portion of the entity which follows the header and which contains the
           real message content.  For example, if your MIME message has a GIF file attachment, then the body  of
           that attachment is the base64-encoded GIF file itself.

           A  body  is  represented by an instance of <b>MIME::Body</b>.  You get the body of an entity by sending it a
           <b>bodyhandle()</b> message.

       body part
           One of the parts of the body of a multipart <b>/entity</b>.  A body part has a <b>/header</b> and a  <b>/body</b>,  so  it
           makes sense to speak about the body of a body part.

           Since a body part is just a kind of entity, it's represented by an instance of <b>MIME::Entity</b>.

       entity
           An "entity" means either a <b>/message</b> or a <b>/body</b> <b>part</b>.  All entities have a <b>/header</b> and a <b>/body</b>.

           An  entity  is represented by an instance of <b>MIME::Entity</b>.  There are instance methods for recovering
           the header (a <b>MIME::Head</b>) and the body (a <b>MIME::Body</b>).

       header
           This is the top portion of the MIME message, which contains  the  "Content-type",  "Content-transfer-
           encoding",  etc.   Every MIME entity has a header, represented by an instance of <b>MIME::Head</b>.  You get
           the header of an entity by sending it a <b>head()</b> message.

       message
           A "message" generally means the complete (or "top-level") message being transferred on a network.

           There currently is no explicit package for "messages"; under MIME::, messages  are  streams  of  data
           which  may  be  read in from files or filehandles.  You can think of the <b>MIME::Entity</b> returned by the
           <b>MIME::Parser</b> as representing the full message.

   <b>Content</b> <b>types</b>
       This indicates what kind of data is in the MIME message, usually as  <u>majortype/minortype</u>.   The  standard
       major types are shown below.  A more-comprehensive listing may be found in RFC-2046.

       application
           Data  which  does  not  fit in any of the other categories, particularly data to be processed by some
           type     of      application      program.       "application/octet-stream",      "application/gzip",
           "application/postscript"...

       audio
           Audio data.  "audio/basic"...

       image
           Graphics data.  "image/gif", "image/jpeg"...

       message
           A message, usually another mail or MIME message.  "message/rfc822"...

       multipart
           A message containing other messages.  "multipart/mixed", "multipart/alternative"...

       text
           Textual data, meant for humans to read.  "text/plain", "text/html"...

       video
           Video or video+audio data.  "video/mpeg"...

   <b>Content</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>encodings</b>
       This  is  how the message body is packaged up for safe transit.  There are the 5 major MIME encodings.  A
       more-comprehensive listing may be found in RFC-2045.

       7bit
           No encoding is done at all.  This label simply asserts that no 8-bit characters are present, and that
           lines do not exceed 1000 characters in length (including the CRLF).

       8bit
           No encoding is done at all.   This  label  simply  asserts  that  the  message  might  contain  8-bit
           characters, and that lines do not exceed 1000 characters in length (including the CRLF).

       binary
           No  encoding  is  done  at  all.   This  label  simply  asserts  that the message might contain 8-bit
           characters, and that lines may exceed 1000 characters in length.  Such messages are the <u>least</u>  likely
           to get through mail gateways.

       base64
           A  standard encoding, which maps arbitrary binary data to the 7bit domain.  Like "uuencode", but very
           well-defined.  This is how you should send essentially binary information (tar  files,  GIFs,  JPEGs,
           etc.).

       quoted-printable
           A standard encoding, which maps arbitrary line-oriented data to the 7bit domain.  Useful for encoding
           messages which are textual in nature, yet which contain non-ASCII characters (e.g., Latin-1, Latin-2,
           or any other 8-bit alphabet).

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       MIME::Parser, MIME::Head, MIME::Body, MIME::Entity, MIME::Decoder, Mail::Header, Mail::Internet

       The MIME format is documented in RFCs 1521-1522, and more recently in RFCs 2045-2049.

       The MIME header format is an outgrowth of the mail header format documented in RFC 822.
