</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTML::HTML5::Entities - drop-in replacement for HTML::Entities

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use HTML::Entities;

        my $enc = encode_entities('fish &amp; chips');
        print "$enc\n";   # fish &amp;amp; chips

        my $dec = decode_entities($enc);
        print "$dec\n";   # fish &amp; chips

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a drop-in replacement for HTML::Entities, providing the character entities defined in HTML5. Some
       caveats:

       •   The implementation is pure perl, hence in some cases slower, especially decoding.

       •   It will not work in Perl &lt; 5.8.1.

   <b>Functions</b>
       "decode_entities($string, ...)"
           This routine replaces HTML entities found in the $string with the corresponding Unicode character. If
           multiple  strings  are  provided as arguments they are each decoded separately and the same number of
           strings are returned.

           If called in void context the arguments are decoded in-place.

           This routine is exported by default.

       "_decode_entities($string, \%entity2char)"
       "_decode_entities($string, \%entity2char, $expand_prefix)"
           This will in-place replace HTML entities in $string. The %entity2char hash must  be  provided.  Named
           entities not found in the %entity2char hash are left alone. Numeric entities are always expanded.

           If $expand_prefix is TRUE then entities without trailing ";" in %entity2char will even be expanded as
           a prefix of a longer unrecognized name.

            $string = "foo&amp;nbspbar";
            _decode_entities($string, { nb =&gt; "@", nbsp =&gt; "\xA0" }, 1);
            print $string;  # will print "foo bar"

           This routine is exported by default.

       "encode_entities($string)"
       "encode_entities($string, $unsafe_chars)"
           This  routine  replaces  unsafe  characters  in  $string  with  their entity representation. A second
           argument can be given to specify which characters to consider unsafe (i.e., which  to  escape).  This
           may be a regular expression.

           If called in void context the string is encoded in-place.

           This routine is exported by default.

       "encode_entities_numeric($string)"
           This  routine  works  just  like  encode_entities,  except  that  the replacement entities are always
           numeric.

           This routine is not exported by default.

       "num_entity($string)"
           Given a single character string, encodes it as a numeric entity.

           This routine is not exported by default.

       The following functions cannot be exported. They behave the same as the exportable functions.

       "HTML::Entities::decode($string, ...)"
       "HTML::Entities::encode($string)"
       "HTML::Entities::encode($string, $unsafe_characters)"
       "HTML::Entities::encode_numeric($string)"
       "HTML::Entities::encode_numeric($string, $unsafe_characters)"
       "HTML::Entities::encode_numerically($string)"
       "HTML::Entities::encode_numerically($string, $unsafe_characters)"

   <b>Variables</b>
       $HTML::HTML5::Entities::hex
           This variable controls whether numeric entities will use hexadecimal or decimal notation. It is  TRUE
           (hexadecimal) by default, but can be set to FALSE.

           It only affects the encoding functions. Decoding always understands both notations.

       %HTML::HTML5::Entities::char2entity
       %HTML::HTML5::Entities::entity2char
           There  contain  the  mapping  from  all  characters  to  the  corresponding entities (and vice versa,
           respectively). These variables may be exported.

           Note that %char2entity is a more conservative set of mappings, intended to be  safe  for  serialising
           strings  to HTML4, HTML5 and XHTML 1.x. And for hysterical raisins, %entity2char does not include the
           leading ampersands, while %char2entity does.
