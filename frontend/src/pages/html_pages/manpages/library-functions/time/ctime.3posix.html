</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ctime, ctime_r — convert a time value to a date and time string

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/time.h">time.h</a>&gt;

       char *ctime(const time_t *<u>clock</u>);
       char *ctime_r(const time_t *<u>clock</u>, char *<u>buf</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For  <u>ctime</u>():  The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any
       conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  <u>ctime</u>()  function shall convert the time pointed to by <u>clock</u>, representing time in seconds since the
       Epoch, to local time in the form of a string. It shall be equivalent to:

           asctime(localtime(clock))

       The <u>asctime</u>(), <u>ctime</u>(), <u>gmtime</u>(), and <u>localtime</u>() functions shall return values  in  one  of  two  static
       objects:  a  broken-down  time  structure  and  an  array of <b>char</b>.  Execution of any of the functions may
       overwrite the information returned in either of these objects by any of the other functions.

       The <u>ctime</u>() function need not be thread-safe.

       The <u>ctime_r</u>() function shall convert the calendar time pointed to by <u>clock</u> to local time in  exactly  the
       same  form  as  <u>ctime</u>()  and  put the string into the array pointed to by <u>buf</u> (which shall be at least 26
       bytes in size) and return <u>buf</u>.

       Unlike <u>ctime</u>(), the <u>ctime_r</u>() function is not required to set <u>tzname</u>.  If <u>ctime_r</u>() sets <u>tzname</u>, it shall
       also set <u>daylight</u> and <u>timezone</u>.  If <u>ctime_r</u>() does not set <u>tzname</u>, it shall not set  <u>daylight</u>  and  shall
       not set <u>timezone</u>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>ctime</u>()  function  shall  return  the pointer returned by <u>asctime</u>() with that broken-down time as an
       argument.

       Upon successful completion, <u>ctime_r</u>() shall return a pointer to the string pointed to by  <u>buf</u>.   When  an
       error is encountered, a null pointer shall be returned.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       These  functions  are  included  only  for  compatibility with older implementations. They have undefined
       behavior if the resulting string would be too long, so the use of these functions should be  discouraged.
       On  implementations  that  do  not  detect  output string length overflow, it is possible to overflow the
       output buffers in such a way as to cause applications to fail, or possible  system  security  violations.
       Also,  these  functions  do  not  support  localized  date  and  time  formats.  To avoid these problems,
       applications should use <u>strftime</u>() to generate strings from broken-down times.

       Values for the broken-down time structure can be obtained by calling <u>gmtime</u>() or <u>localtime</u>().

       The <u>ctime_r</u>() function is thread-safe and shall return  values  in  a  user-supplied  buffer  instead  of
       possibly using a static data area that may be overwritten by each call.

       Attempts to use <u>ctime</u>() or <u>ctime_r</u>() for times before the Epoch or for times beyond the year 9999 produce
       undefined results. Refer to <u>asctime</u>().

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  standard developers decided to mark the <u>ctime</u>() and <u>ctime_r</u>() functions obsolescent even though they
       are in the ISO C standard due to the possibility of buffer overflow. The ISO C standard also provides the
       <u>strftime</u>() function which can be used to avoid these problems.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These functions may be removed in a future version.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u>asctime</u>(), <u>clock</u>(), <u>difftime</u>(), <u>gmtime</u>(), <u>localtime</u>(), <u>mktime</u>(), <u>strftime</u>(), <u>strptime</u>(), <u>time</u>(), <u>utime</u>()
