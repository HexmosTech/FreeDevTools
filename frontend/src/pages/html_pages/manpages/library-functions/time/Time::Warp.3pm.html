</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Time::Warp - control over the flow of time

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Time::Warp qw(scale to time);

           to(time + 5);  # 5 seconds ahead
           <a href="../man2/scale.2.html">scale</a>(2);      # make time flow twice normal

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Our external experience unfolds in 3 1/2 dimensions (time has a dimensionality of 1/2).  The Time::Warp
       module offers developers control over the measurement of time.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       •   to($desired_time)

           The theory of relativity asserts that all physical laws are enforced relative to the observer.  Since
           the  starting  point  of  time  is arbitrary, it is permissible to change it.  This has the effect of
           making it appear as if time is moving forwards or backward instanteously.  For example, on some types
           of operating systems time starts at Wed Dec 31 19:00:00 1969 (this will likely change as we  approach
           2030 and with the acceptance of 64-bit CPUs).

             to(time + 60*60);       # 1 hour ahead

       •   scale($factor)

           Changes the speed at which time is progressing.

             scale(scale * 2);   # double the speed of time

           Note  that  it  is  not  possible  to stop time or cause it to reverse since this is forbidden by the
           second law of thermodynamics.
