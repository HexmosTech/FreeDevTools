</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer2::Core::Time - class to handle common helpers for time manipulations

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.1.2

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $time = Dancer2::Core::Time-&gt;new( expression =&gt; "1h" );
           $time-&gt;seconds; # return 3600

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For consistency, whenever something needs to work with time, it needs to be expressed in seconds, with a
       timestamp. Although it's very convenient for the machine and calculations, it's not very handy for a
       human-being, for instance in a configuration file.

       This class provides everything needed to translate any human-understandable expression into a number of
       seconds.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>seconds</b>
       Number of seconds represented by the object. Defaults to 0.

   <b>epoch</b>
       The current epoch to handle. Defaults to seconds + time.

   <b>gmt_string</b>
       Convert the current value in epoch as a GMT string.

   <b>expression</b>
       Required. A human readable expression representing the number of seconds to provide.

       The format supported is a number followed by an expression. It currently understands:

           s second seconds sec secs
           m minute minutes min mins
           h hr hour hours
           d day days
           w week weeks
           M month months
           y year years

       Months and years are currently fixed at 30 and 365 days.  This may change.  Anything else is used
       verbatim as the expression of a number of seconds.

       Example:

           2 hours, 3 days, 3d, 1 week, 3600, etc...
