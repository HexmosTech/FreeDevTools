</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Time::Period - A Perl module to deal with time periods.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       "use Time::Period;"

       "$result = inPeriod($time, $period);"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>inPeriod</b> function determines if a given time falls within a given period.  <b>inPeriod</b> returns <b>1</b> if the
       time does fall within the given period, <b>0</b> if not, and <b>-1</b> if <b>inPeriod</b> detects a malformed time or period.

       The time is specified as per the "time()" function, which is assumed to be the number of non-leap seconds
       since January 1, 1970.

       The period is specified as a string which adheres to the format

               sub-period[, sub-period...]

       or the string "none" or whitespace.  The string "none" is not case sensitive.

       If the period is blank, then any time period is assumed because the time period has not been restricted.
       In that case, <b>inPeriod</b> returns 1.  If the period is "none", then no time period applies and <b>inPeriod</b>
       returns 0.

       A sub-period is of the form

               scale {range [range ...]} [scale {range [range ...]}]

       Scale must be one of nine different scales (or their equivalent codes):

               Scale  | Scale | Valid Range Values
                      | Code  |
               *******|*******|************************************************
               year   |  yr   | n     where n is an integer 0&lt;=n&lt;=99 or n&gt;=1970
               month  |  mo   | 1-12  or  jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul,
                      |       |           aug, sep, oct, nov, dec
               week   |  wk   | 1-6
               yday   |  yd   | 1-366
               mday   |  md   | 1-31
               wday   |  wd   | 1-7   or  su, mo, tu, we, th, fr, sa
               hour   |  hr   | 0-23  or  12am 1am-11am 12noon 12pm 1pm-11pm
               minute |  min  | 0-59
               second |  sec  | 0-59

       The same scale type may be specified multiple times.  Additional scales simply extend the range defined
       by previous scales of the same type.

       The range for a given scale must be a valid value in the form of

               v

       or

               v-v

       For the range specification v-v, if the first value is larger than the second value (e.g. "min {20-10}"),
       the range wraps around unless the scale specification is year.

       Year does not wrap because the year is never really reset, it just increments.  Ignoring that fact has
       lead to the dreaded year 2000 nightmare.  When the year rolls over from 99 to 00, it has really rolled
       over a century, not gone back a century.  <b>inPeriod</b> supports the dangerous two digit year notation because
       it is so rampant.  However, <b>inPeriod</b> converts the two digit notation to four digits by prepending the
       first two digits from the current year.  In the case of 99-1972, the 99 is translated to whatever current
       century it is (probably 20th), and then range 99-1972 is treated as 1972-1999.  If it were the 21st
       century, then the range would be 1972-2099.

       Anyway, if v-v is 9-2 and the scale is month, September, October, November, December, January, and
       February are the months that the range specifies.  If v-v is 2-9, then the valid months are February,
       March, April, May, Jun, July, August, and September.  9-2 is the same as Sep-Feb.

       v isn't a point in time.  In the context of the hour scale, 9 specifies the time period from 9:00:00 am
       to 9:59:59 am.  This is what most people would call 9-10.  In other words, v is discrete in its time
       scale.  9 changes to 10 when 9:59:59 changes to 10:00:00, but it is 9 from 9:00:00 to 9:59:59.  Just
       before 9:00:00, v was 8.

       Note that whitespace can be anywhere and case is not important.  Note also that scales must be specified
       either in long form (year, month, week, etc.) or in code form (yr, mo, wk, etc.).  Scale forms may be
       mixed in a period statement.

       Furthermore, when using letters to specify ranges, only the first two for week days or the first three
       for months are significant.  January is a valid specification for jan, and Sunday is a valid
       specification for su.  Sun is also valid for su.

   <b>PERIOD</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b>
       To specify a time period from Monday through Friday, 9am to 5pm, use a period such as

               wd {Mon-Fri} hr {9am-4pm}

       When specifing a range by using -, it is best to think of - as meaning through.  It is 9am through 4pm,
       which is just before 5pm.

       To specify a time period from Monday through Friday, 9am to 5pm on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and 9am
       to 3pm on Tuesday and Thursday, use a period such as

               wd {Mon Wed Fri} hr {9am-4pm}, wd{Tue Thu} hr {9am-2pm}

       To specify a time period that extends Mon-Fri 9am-5pm, but alternates weeks in a month, use a period such
       as

               wk {1 3 5} wd {Mon Wed Fri} hr {9am-4pm}

       Or how about a period that specifies winter?

               mo {Nov-Feb}

       This is equivalent to the previous example:

               mo {Jan-Feb Nov-Dec}

       As is

               mo {jan feb nov dec}

       And this is too:

               mo {Jan Feb}, mo {Nov Dec}

       Wait!  So is this:

               mo {Jan Feb} mo {Nov Dec}

       To specify a period that describes every other half-hour, use something like

               minute { 0-29 }

       To specify the morning, use

               hour { 12am-11am }

       Remember, 11am is not 11:00:00am, but rather 11:00:00am - 11:59:59am.

       Hmmmm, 5 second blocks could be a fun period...

               sec {0-4 10-14 20-24 30-34 40-44 50-54}

       To specify every first half-hour on alternating week days, and the second half-hour the rest of the week,
       use the period

               wd {1 3 5 7} min {0-29}, wd {2 4 6} min {30-59}
