</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       asctime, asctime_r — convert date and time to a string

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/time.h">time.h</a>&gt;

       char *asctime(const struct tm *<u>timeptr</u>);
       char *asctime_r(const struct tm *restrict <u>tm</u>, char *restrict <u>buf</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For <u>asctime</u>(): The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any
       conflict  between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <u>asctime</u>() function shall convert the broken-down time in the structure pointed to by <u>timeptr</u>  into  a
       string in the form:

           Sun Sep 16 01:03:52 1973\n\0

       using the equivalent of the following algorithm:

           char *asctime(const struct tm *timeptr)
           {
               static char wday_name[7][3] = {
                   "Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"
               };
               static char mon_name[12][3] = {
                   "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun",
                   "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"
               };
               static char result[26];

               sprintf(result, "%.3s %.3s%3d %.2d:%.2d:%.2d %d\n",
                   wday_name[timeptr-&gt;tm_wday],
                   mon_name[timeptr-&gt;tm_mon],
                   timeptr-&gt;tm_mday, timeptr-&gt;tm_hour,
                   timeptr-&gt;tm_min, timeptr-&gt;tm_sec,
                   1900 + timeptr-&gt;tm_year);
               return result;
           }

       However,  the  behavior  is  undefined  if  <u>timeptr</u>-&gt;<u>tm_wday</u> or <u>timeptr</u>-&gt;<u>tm_mon</u> are not within the normal
       ranges as defined in <u>&lt;time.h&gt;</u>, or if <u>timeptr</u>-&gt;<u>tm_year</u> exceeds {INT_MAX}-1990, or if the  above  algorithm
       would attempt to generate more than 26 bytes of output (including the terminating null).

       The <b>tm</b> structure is defined in the <u>&lt;time.h&gt;</u> header.

       The  <u>asctime</u>(),  <u>ctime</u>(),  <u>gmtime</u>(),  and  <u>localtime</u>() functions shall return values in one of two static
       objects: a broken-down time structure and an array of type <b>char</b>.  Execution of any of the  functions  may
       overwrite the information returned in either of these objects by any of the other functions.

       The <u>asctime</u>() function need not be thread-safe.

       The  <u>asctime_r</u>()  function  shall  convert  the broken-down time in the structure pointed to by <u>tm</u> into a
       string (of the same form as that returned by <u>asctime</u>(), and with the same undefined behavior  when  input
       or  output  is  out  of  range) that is placed in the user-supplied buffer pointed to by <u>buf</u> (which shall
       contain at least 26 bytes) and then return <u>buf</u>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, <u>asctime</u>() shall  return  a  pointer  to  the  string.   If  the  function  is
       unsuccessful, it shall return NULL.

       Upon  successful completion, <u>asctime_r</u>() shall return a pointer to a character string containing the date
       and time. This string is pointed to by the argument <u>buf</u>.  If  the  function  is  unsuccessful,  it  shall
       return NULL.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       These  functions  are  included  only  for  compatibility with older implementations. They have undefined
       behavior if the resulting string would be too long, so the use of these functions should be  discouraged.
       On  implementations  that  do  not  detect  output string length overflow, it is possible to overflow the
       output buffers in such a way as to cause applications to fail, or possible  system  security  violations.
       Also,  these  functions  do  not  support  localized  date  and  time  formats.  To avoid these problems,
       applications should use <u>strftime</u>() to generate strings from broken-down times.

       Values for the broken-down time structure can be obtained by calling <u>gmtime</u>() or <u>localtime</u>().

       The <u>asctime_r</u>() function is thread-safe and shall return values in  a  user-supplied  buffer  instead  of
       possibly using a static data area that may be overwritten by each call.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  standard  developers decided to mark the <u>asctime</u>() and <u>asctime_r</u>() functions obsolescent even though
       <u>asctime</u>() is in the ISO C standard due to the possibility of buffer overflow.  The  ISO C  standard  also
       provides the <u>strftime</u>() function which can be used to avoid these problems.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These functions may be removed in a future version.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u>clock</u>(), <u>ctime</u>(), <u>difftime</u>(), <u>gmtime</u>(), <u>localtime</u>(), <u>mktime</u>(), <u>strftime</u>(), <u>strptime</u>(), <u>time</u>(), <u>utime</u>()
