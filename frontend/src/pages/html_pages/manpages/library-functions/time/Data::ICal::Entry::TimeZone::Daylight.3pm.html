       Data::ICal::Entry::TimeZone::Daylight - Represents a Daylight Time base offset from UTC for parent
       TimeZone

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A time zone is unambiguously defined by the set of time measurement rules determined by the governing
       body for a given geographic area. These rules describe at a minimum the base offset from UTC for the time
       zone, often referred to as the Standard Time offset. Many locations adjust their Standard Time forward or
       backward by one hour, in order to accommodate seasonal changes in number of daylight hours, often
       referred to as Daylight Saving Time. Some locations adjust their time by a fraction of an hour. Standard
       Time is also known as Winter Time. Daylight Saving Time is also known as Advanced Time, Summer Time, or
       Legal Time in certain countries. The following table shows the changes in time zone rules in effect for
       New York City starting from 1967. Each line represents a description or rule for a particular observance.

            Effective Observance Rule

            Date       (Date/Time)             Offset  Abbreviation

            1967-*     last Sun in Oct, 02:00  -0500   EST

            1967-1973  last Sun in Apr, 02:00  -0400   EDT

            1974-1974  Jan 6,  02:00           -0400   EDT

            1975-1975  Feb 23, 02:00           -0400   EDT

            1976-1986  last Sun in Apr, 02:00  -0400   EDT

            1987-*     first Sun in Apr, 02:00 -0400   EDT

       Note: The specification of a global time zone registry is not addressed by this document and is left for
       future study.  However, implementers may find the Olson time zone database [TZ] a useful reference. It is
       an informal, public-domain collection of time zone information, which is currently being maintained by
       volunteer Internet participants, and is used in several operating systems. This database contains current
       and historical time zone information for a wide variety of locations around the globe; it provides a time
       zone identifier for every unique time zone rule set in actual use since 1970, with historical data going
       back to the introduction of standard time.
