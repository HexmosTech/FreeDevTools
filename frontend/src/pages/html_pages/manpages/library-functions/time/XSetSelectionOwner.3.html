       XSetSelectionOwner, XGetSelectionOwner, XConvertSelection - manipulate window selection

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>

       int XSetSelectionOwner(Display *<u>display</u>, Atom <u>selection</u>, Window <u>owner</u>, Time <u>time</u>);

       Window XGetSelectionOwner(Display *<u>display</u>, Atom <u>selection</u>);

       int  XConvertSelection(Display  *<u>display</u>,  Atom  <u>selection</u>, Atom <u>target</u>, Atom <u>property</u>, Window <u>requestor</u>,
              Time <u>time</u>);

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>display</u>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <u>owner</u>     Specifies the owner of the specified selection atom.  You can pass a window or <b>None</b>.

       <u>property</u>  Specifies the property name.  You also can pass <b>None</b>.

       <u>requestor</u> Specifies the requestor.

       <u>selection</u> Specifies the selection atom.

       <u>target</u>    Specifies the target atom.

       <u>time</u>      Specifies the time.  You can pass either a timestamp or <b>CurrentTime</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>XSetSelectionOwner</b> function changes the owner and last-change time for the  specified  selection  and
       has  no  effect  if  the  specified  time  is  earlier than the current last-change time of the specified
       selection or is later than the current X server time.  Otherwise, the last-change  time  is  set  to  the
       specified  time,  with <b>CurrentTime</b> replaced by the current server time.  If the owner window is specified
       as <b>None</b>, then the owner of the selection becomes <b>None</b> (that is, no owner).  Otherwise, the owner  of  the
       selection becomes the client executing the request.

       If the new owner (whether a client or <b>None</b>) is not the same as the current owner of the selection and the
       current  owner  is not <b>None</b>, the current owner is sent a <b>SelectionClear</b> event.  If the client that is the
       owner of a selection is later terminated (that is, its connection is closed) or if the  owner  window  it
       has  specified  in  the  request  is later destroyed, the owner of the selection automatically reverts to
       <b>None</b>, but the last-change time is not affected.  The selection atom is uninterpreted  by  the  X  server.
       <b>XGetSelectionOwner</b>  returns  the  owner  window, which is reported in <b>SelectionRequest</b> and <b>SelectionClear</b>
       events.  Selections are global to the X server.

       <b>XSetSelectionOwner</b> can generate <b>BadAtom</b> and <b>BadWindow</b> errors.

       The <b>XGetSelectionOwner</b> function returns the window ID associated with the window that currently owns  the
       specified  selection.  If no selection was specified, the function returns the constant <b>None</b>.  If <b>None</b> is
       returned, there is no owner for the selection.

       <b>XGetSelectionOwner</b> can generate a <b>BadAtom</b> error.

       <b>XConvertSelection</b> requests that the specified selection be converted to the specified target type:

       •    If the specified selection has an owner, the X server sends a <b>SelectionRequest</b> event to that owner.

       •    If no owner for the specified selection exists, the X server generates a  <b>SelectionNotify</b>  event  to
            the requestor with property <b>None</b>.

       The arguments are passed on unchanged in either of the events.  There are two predefined selection atoms:
       PRIMARY and SECONDARY.

       <b>XConvertSelection</b> can generate <b>BadAtom</b> and <b>BadWindow</b> errors.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BadAtom</b>   A value for an Atom argument does not name a defined Atom.

       <b>BadWindow</b> A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
