</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Time::Tiny - A time object, with as little code as possible

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.08

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # Create a time manually
         $christmas = Time::Tiny-&gt;new(
             hour   =&gt; 10,
             minute =&gt; 45,
             second =&gt; 0,
             );

         # Show the current time
         $now = Time::Tiny-&gt;now;
         print "Hour   : " . $now-&gt;hour   . "\n";
         print "Minute : " . $now-&gt;minute . "\n";
         print "Second : " . $now-&gt;second . "\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Time::Tiny</b> is a member of the DateTime::Tiny suite of time modules.

       It implements an extremely lightweight object that represents a time, without any time data.

   <b>The</b> <b>Tiny</b> <b>Mandate</b>
       Many CPAN modules which provide the best implementation of a concept can be very large. For some reason,
       this generally seems to be about 3 megabyte of ram usage to load the module.

       For a lot of the situations in which these large and comprehensive implementations exist, some people
       will only need a small fraction of the functionality, or only need this functionality in an ancillary
       role.

       The aim of the Tiny modules is to implement an alternative to the large module that implements a subset
       of the functionality, using as little code as possible.

       Typically, this means a module that implements between 50% and 80% of the features of the larger module,
       but using only 100 kilobytes of code, which is about 1/30th of the larger module.

   <b>The</b> <b>Concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tiny</b> <b>Date</b> <b>and</b> <b>Time</b>
       Due to the inherent complexity, Date and Time is intrinsically very difficult to implement properly.

       The arguably <b>only</b> module to implement it completely correct is DateTime. However, to implement it
       properly DateTime is quite slow and requires 3-4 megabytes of memory to load.

       The challenge in implementing a Tiny equivalent to DateTime is to do so without making the functionality
       critically flawed, and to carefully select the subset of functionality to implement.

       If you look at where the main complexity and cost exists, you will find that it is relatively cheap to
       represent a date or time as an object, but much much more expensive to modify or convert the object.

       As a result, <b>Time::Tiny</b> provides the functionality required to represent a date as an object, to
       stringify the date and to parse it back in, but does <b>not</b> allow you to modify the dates.

       The purpose of this is to allow for date object representations in situations like log parsing and fast
       real-time work.

       The problem with this is that having no ability to modify date limits the usefulness greatly.

       To make up for this, <b>if</b> you have DateTime installed, any <b>Time::Tiny</b> module can be inflated into the
       equivalent DateTime as needed, loading DateTime on the fly if necessary.

       For the purposes of date/time logic, all <b>Time::Tiny</b> objects exist in the "C" locale, and the "floating"
       time zone (although obviously in a pure date context, the time zone largely doesn't matter).

       When converting up to full DateTime objects, these locale and time zone settings will be applied
       (although an ability is provided to override this).

       In addition, the implementation is strictly correct and is intended to be very easily to sub-class for
       specific purposes of your own.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       In general, the intent is that the API be as close as possible to the API for DateTime. Except, of
       course, that this module implements less of it.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         # Create a Time::Tiny object for midnight
         my $midnight = Time::Tiny-&gt;new(
             hour   =&gt; 0,
             minute =&gt; 0,
             second =&gt; 0,
         );

       The "new" constructor creates a new <b>Time::Tiny</b> object.

       It takes three named parameters. "hour" should be the hour of the day (0-23), "minute" should be the
       minute of the hour (0-59), and "second" should be the second of the minute (0-59).

       These are the only parameters accepted.

       Returns a new <b>Time::Tiny</b> object.

   <b>now</b>
         my $current_time = Time::Tiny-&gt;now;

       The "now" method creates a new date object for the current time.

       The time created will be based on localtime, despite the fact that the time is created in the floating
       time zone.

       This means that the time created by "now" is somewhat lossy, but since the primary purpose of <b>Time::Tiny</b>
       is for small transient time objects, and <b>not</b> for use in calculations and comparisons, this is considered
       acceptable for now.

       Returns a new <b>Time::Tiny</b> object.

   <b>hour</b>
       The "hour" accessor returns the hour component of the time as an integer from zero to twenty-three (0-23)
       in line with 24-hour time.

   <b>minute</b>
       The "minute" accessor returns the minute component of the time as an integer from zero to fifty-nine
       (0-59).

   <b>second</b>
       The "second" accessor returns the second component of the time as an integer from zero to fifty-nine
       (0-59).

   <b>from_string</b>
       The "from_string" method creates a new <b>Time::Tiny</b> object from a string.

       The string is expected to be an "hh:mm:ss" type ISO 8601 time string.

         my $almost_midnight = Time::Tiny-&gt;from_string( '23:59:59' );

       Returns a new <b>Time::Tiny</b> object, or throws an exception on error.

   <b>as_string</b>
       The "as_string" method converts the time object to an ISO 8601 time string, with separators (see example
       in "from_string").

       Returns a string.

   <b>DateTime</b>
       The "DateTime" method is used to create a DateTime object that is equivalent to the <b>Time::Tiny</b> object,
       for use in conversions and calculations.

       As mentioned earlier, the object will be set to the 'C' locate, and the 'floating' time zone.

       If installed, the DateTime module will be loaded automatically.

       Returns a DateTime object, or throws an exception if DateTime is not installed on the current host.
