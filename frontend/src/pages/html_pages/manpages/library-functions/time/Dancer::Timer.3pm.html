</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer::Timer - a timer for Dancer

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.3521

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Dancer::Timer;

           my $timer = Dancer::Timer-&gt;new();
           my $time  = $timer-&gt;tick;
           print "[$time]: Doing something\n";

           # (time passes)
           $time = $timer-&gt;tick;
           print "[$time]: Doing something else\n";

           # (time passes)
           $time = $timer-&gt;to_string;
           print "[$time]: Doing another thing\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer::Timer provides Dancer with a timing object to clock operations. For example, you might want a
       logging that shows you when each operation happened (at what time) to determine how long each operation
       was in order to know where to focus on for possible bugs or perhaps unnecessary slowness.

       Dancer uses Dancer::Timer in facilities that want to provide this for you. Any plugin author is more than
       welcome to use it as well.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>start_time</b>
       Retains the starting time of the timer. The default value is when the object is created. It fetches that
       using "gettimeofday" from Time::HiRes.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>init</b>
       This method is called when "-&gt;new()" is called. It initializes the "start_time" attribute.

   <b>tick</b>
       Creates a tick in the timer and returns the interval between the "start_time" and now.

   <b>to_string</b>
       Same as "tick", just more expressive.
