</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Time::Duration - rounded or exact English expression of durations

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Example use in a program that ends by noting its runtime:

         my $start_time = time();
         use Time::Duration;

         # then things that take all that time, and then ends:
         print "Runtime ", duration(time() - $start_time), ".\n";

       Example use in a program that reports age of a file:

         use Time::Duration;
         my $file = 'that_file';
         my $age = $^T - (stat($file))[9];  # 9 = modtime
         print "$file was modified ", ago($age);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides functions for expressing durations in rounded or exact terms.

       In the first example in the Synopsis, using duration($interval_seconds):

       If the "time() - $start_time" is 3 seconds, this prints "Runtime: <b>3</b> <b>seconds</b>.".  If it's 0 seconds, it's
       "Runtime: <b>0</b> <b>seconds</b>.".  If it's 1 second, it's "Runtime: <b>1</b> <b>second</b>.".  If it's 125 seconds, you get
       "Runtime: <b>2</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>5</b> <b>seconds</b>.".  If it's 3820 seconds (which is exactly 1h, 3m, 40s), you get it
       rounded to fit within two expressed units: "Runtime: <b>1</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>4</b> <b>minutes</b>.".  Using duration_exact
       instead would return "Runtime: <b>1</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>3</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>40</b> <b>seconds</b>".

       In the second example in the Synopsis, using ago($interval_seconds):

       If the $age is 3 seconds, this prints "<u>file</u> was modified <b>3</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>ago</b>".  If it's 0 seconds, it's "<u>file</u>
       was modified <b>just</b> <b>now</b>", as a special case.  If it's 1 second, it's "from <b>1</b> <b>second</b> <b>ago</b>".  If it's 125
       seconds, you get "<u>file</u> was modified <b>2</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>5</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>ago</b>".  If it's 3820 seconds (which is exactly
       1h, 3m, 40s), you get it rounded to fit within two expressed units: "<u>file</u> was modified <b>1</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>4</b>
       <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b>".  Using ago_exact instead would return "<u>file</u> was modified <b>1</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>3</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>40</b> <b>seconds</b>
       <b>ago</b>".  And if the file's modtime is, surprisingly, three seconds into the future, $age is -3, and you'll
       get the equally and appropriately surprising "<u>file</u> was modified <b>3</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b>."

</pre><h4><b>MILLISECOND</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       By default, this module assumes input is an integer representing number of seconds and only emits results
       based on the integer part of any floating-point values passed to it.  However, if you set the variable
       $Time::Duration::MILLISECOND to any true value, then the methods will interpret inputs as floating-point
       numbers and will emit results containing information about the number of milliseconds in the value.

       For example, "duration(1.021)" will return <b>1</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>21</b> <b>milliseconds</b> in this mode.

       Millisecond mode is not enabled by default because this module sees heavy use and existing users of it
       may be relying on its implicit truncation of non-integer arguments.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides all the following functions, which are all exported by default when you call "use
       Time::Duration;".

       duration($seconds)
       duration($seconds, $precision)
           Returns  English  text  expressing  the  approximate  time  duration  of  abs($seconds), with at most
           "$precision   ||   2"   expressed   units.    (That   is,   duration($seconds)   is   the   same   as
           duration($seconds,2).)

           For example, <a href="../man120/duration.120.html">duration</a>(120) or duration(-120) is "2 minutes".  And <b><a href="../man0/duration.0.html">duration</a></b>(0) is "0 seconds".

           The  precision  figure  means  that  no more than that many units will be used in expressing the time
           duration.  For example, 31,629,659 seconds is a duration of <u>exactly</u> 1 year, 1 day, 2  hours,  and  59
           seconds (assuming 1 year = exactly 365 days, as we do assume in this module).  However, if you wanted
           an  approximation  of  this  to  at  most  two expressed (i.e., nonzero) units, it would round it and
           truncate it to "1 year and 1 day".  Max of 3 expressed units would get you "1  year,  1  day,  and  2
           hours".   Max  of  4  expressed  units  would get you "1 year, 1 day, 2 hours, and 59 seconds", which
           happens to be exactly true.  Max of 5 (or more) expressed units would get you the same,  since  there
           are only four nonzero units possible in for that duration.

       duration_exact($seconds)
           Same  as  duration($seconds),  except  that  the returned value is an exact (unrounded) expression of
           $seconds.  For example, <a href="../man31629659/duration_exact.31629659.html">duration_exact</a>(31629659) returns "1 year, 1 day,  2  hours,  and  59  seconds
           later", which is <u>exactly</u> true.

       ago($seconds)
       ago($seconds, $precision)
           For a positive value of seconds, this prints the same as "duration($seconds, [$precision]) . ' ago'".
           For  example,  <a href="../man120/ago.120.html">ago</a>(120) is "2 minutes ago".  For a negative value of seconds, this prints the same as
           "duration($seconds, [$precision]) . ' from now'".  For example, ago(-120) is "2  minutes  from  now".
           As a special case, <b><a href="../man0/ago.0.html">ago</a></b>(0) returns "right now".

       ago_exact($seconds)
           Same as ago($seconds), except that the returned value is an exact (unrounded) expression of $seconds.

       from_now($seconds)
       from_now($seconds, $precision)
       from_now_exact($seconds)
           The   same   as  ago(-$seconds),  ago(-$seconds,  $precision),  ago_exact(-$seconds).   For  example,
           <a href="../man120/from_now.120.html">from_now</a>(120) is "2 minutes from now".

       later($seconds)
       later($seconds, $precision)
           For a positive value of  seconds,  this  prints  the  same  as  "duration($seconds,  [$precision])  .
           ' later'".  For example, <a href="../man120/ago.120.html">ago</a>(120) is "2 minutes later".  For a negative value of seconds, this prints
           the  same as "duration($seconds, [$precision]) . ' earlier'".  For example, later(-120) is "2 minutes
           earlier".  As a special case, <b><a href="../man0/later.0.html">later</a></b>(0) returns "right then".

       later_exact($seconds)
           Same as later($seconds), except that the  returned  value  is  an  exact  (unrounded)  expression  of
           $seconds.

       earlier($seconds)
       earlier($seconds, $precision)
       earlier_exact($seconds)
           The  same  as  later(-$seconds),  later(-$seconds, $precision), later_exact(-$seconds).  For example,
           <a href="../man120/earlier.120.html">earlier</a>(120) is "2 minutes earlier".

       concise( <u>function(</u> ... ) )
           Concise takes the string output of one of the  above  functions  and  makes  it  more  concise.   For
           example,  "<a href="../man4567/ago.4567.html">ago</a>(4567)"  returns  "1  hour and 16 minutes ago", but "concise(<a href="../man4567/ago.4567.html">ago</a>(4567))" returns "1h16m
           ago".

</pre><h4><b>I18N/L10N</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Little of the internals of this module are English-specific.  See source  and/or  contact  me  if  you're
       interested in making a localized version for some other language than English.

</pre><h4><b>BACKSTORY</b></h4><pre>
       I  wrote the basic "ago()" function for use in Infobot ("<a href="http://www.infobot.org">http://www.infobot.org</a>"), because I was tired of
       this sort of response from the Purl Infobot:

         me&gt; Purl, seen Woozle?
         &lt;Purl&gt; Woozle was last seen on #perl 20 days, 7 hours, 32 minutes
         and 40 seconds ago, saying: Wuzzle!

       I figured if it was 20 days ago, I don't care about the seconds.   So  once  I  had  written  "ago()",  I
       abstracted the code a bit and got all the other functions.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEAT</b></h4><pre>
       This  module  calls a durational "year" an interval of exactly 365 days of exactly 24 hours each, with no
       provision for leap years or monkey business with 23/25 hour days (much less leap  seconds!).   But  since
       the main work of this module is approximation, that shouldn't be a great problem for most purposes.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Time::Elapsed  -  similarly  converts  durations  to  natural  language,  but in addition to English also
       supports Danish, German, French, and Turkish.

       Date::Interval, which is similarly named, but does something rather different.

       <u>Star</u> <u>Trek:</u> <u>The</u> <u>Next</u> <u>Generation</u> (1987-1994), where the character Data would express time durations like "1
       year, 20 days, 22 hours, 59 minutes, and 35 seconds" instead of rounding to "1 year and 21  days".   This
       is because no-one ever told him to use Time::Duration.
