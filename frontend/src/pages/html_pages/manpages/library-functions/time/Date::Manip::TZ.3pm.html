</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Date::Manip::TZ - an interface to the time zone data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use Date::Manip::TZ;
          $tz = new Date::Manip::TZ;

       Data for most (and hopefully all) time zones used around the world have been gathered and is publicly
       available in the zoneinfo (or Olson) database.

       This module uses the data from the zoneinfo database to perform various time zone operations.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Every time zone has some of the following characteristics:

       <b>name</b>
           Every time zone has a unique name. In the zoneinfo database, these are something similar to:

              America/New_York

       <b>aliases</b>
           Time zones may have (but are not required to have) one or more aliases.  Each alias is unique, and is
           not the same as any time zone name. An alias can be used in exactly the same way as a name.

       <b>periods</b>
           Every  time  zone  is  broken up into periods. Each period describes how a portion of time relates to
           GMT, and how it might be expressed.

       Each period includes the following information:

       <b>start</b> <b>time,</b> <b>end</b> <b>time</b>
           The period begin and ends at certain times. The times are included both as an absolute GMT time,  and
           as  a  wall  clock  time.   The wall clock start time is the time that will be on a clock just as the
           period starts (i.e. after a time change). The wall clock end time is the time on a clock  immediately
           before the period ends.

       <b>offset</b>
           The entire period has an offset which is how much the wall clock time differs from GMT.

       <b>abbreviation</b>
           When expressing the time period, an abbreviation (such as EST) is typically used.

       <b>daylight</b> <b>saving</b> <b>time</b> <b>flag</b>
           Every period is categorized as a standard time or a daylight saving time. The flag will be 1 if it is
           a daylight saving time, or 0 if it is a standard time.

       Date::Manip  includes  all of the data for all of the time zones from the zoneinfo database. This data is
       available from:

       &lt;<a href="ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/">ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/</a>&gt;

       Additional data from other standards are also used.

       The zoneinfo database is not necessary in order to use Date::Manip.  Instead, all of that data  has  been
       extracted  and stored in a series of other modules which are used to handle each time zone.  In that way,
       Date::Manip has no dependency on any other source of data.

       The Date::Manip::Zones document contains detailed information on the data available.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       In all methods, the following variables are used:

       <b>$zone</b>
           This is a string which contains a valid time zone name.  For example:

             America/New_York

       <b>$alias</b>
           This is a strings which contains a valid time zone name, or a valid time zone alias. For example:

             America/New_York
             US/Eastern
             EST5EDT

       <b>$abbrev</b>
           This is a string which contains a valid time zone abbreviation. For example:

             EST

       <b>$offset</b>
           This is a time zone entered as an offset. An offset is either a string of one of the formats:

             +HH
             +HHMM
             +HHMMSS
             +HH:MM
             +HH:MM:SS

           or it can be a list reference:

             [HH,MM,SS]

           If a list reference is used, the sign must be included with all  values.   So,  the  offset  "-05:30"
           would be the list reference:

             [-5,-30,0]

       <b>$dstflag</b>
           This is always one of the values: std, stdonly, dst, dstonly

           It  defaults  to "std" if it is not present. When determining a time zone, it is usually necessary to
           check a number of different time zone and DST combinations.

           If $dstflag is "std", it will check both standard and daylight saving times, but will give preference
           to standard times. If $dstflag is "stdonly", only standard times will be checked.

           The "dst" flag will search both, but give preference to daylight saving times.  The "dstonly"  values
           will only use daylight saving times.

       <b>$date</b>
           A date is always a string containing a date in one of the formats:

              YYYYMMDDHH:MN:SS
              YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MN:SS
              YYYYMMDDHHMNSS

           or a list reference:

              [Y,M,D,H,MN,S]

       <b>$isdst</b>
           This is 0 if a date is in standard time, 1 if it is in daylight saving time.

       <b>$period</b>
           A period is a list reference currently containing the following items:

              [ $dateUT, $dateLT, $offsetstr, $offset, $abbrev, $isdst,
                $endUT, $endLT, $begUTs, $begLTs, $endUTs, $endLTs ]

           $dateUT  and  $dateLT  are  the  starting  date  of the period (i.e. the first second in a period) in
           universal (GMT) time and local (wall clock) time. $endUT and $endLT are the end date  of  the  period
           (i.e.  the  last  second  in  a  period)  in  universal and local time.  These are all stored as list
           references.

           $offsetstr is the string representation of the offset ("+05:00:00") and $offset is the  corresponding
           list reference form ([5,0,0]).

           $abbrev  is  the abbreviation that applies during this period, and $isdst is 0 or 1 if it is standard
           or daylight saving time.

           When accessing the elements in a period, use ONLY positive indices.  In other words, to  get  $endUT,
           access  it as $$period[6], NOT as $$period[-2], since I am considering adding more information to the
           period description that may speed up performance.

           $begUTs is the string representation (YYYYMMDDHH:MN:SS) of $begUT.  Similar for $begLTs, $endUTs, and
           $endLTs.

       The following methods are available:

       <b>base</b>
       <b>config</b>
       <b>err</b>
       <b>new</b>
       <b>new_config</b>
           Please refer to the Date::Manip::Obj documentation for these methods.

       <b>all_periods</b>
              @periods = $tz-&gt;all_periods($zone,$year);

           This returns the description of all time zone periods that occur (in full  or  in  part)  during  the
           given year.  The year is measured in universal (GMT) time.

       <b>convert</b>
       <b>convert_to_gmt</b>
       <b>convert_from_gmt</b>
       <b>convert_to_local</b>
       <b>convert_from_local</b>
           These functions convert a date from one time zone to another.

              ($err,$date,$offset,$isdst,$abbrev) =
                 $tz-&gt;convert($date,$from,$to [,$isdst]);

           This converts a date in the time zone given by $from to the time zone given by $to.

              ($err,$date,$offset,$isdst,$abbrev) =
                 $tz-&gt;convert_to_gmt($date [,$from] [,$isdst]);

           This  converts a date to GMT. If $from is given, it is the current time zone of the date. If $from is
           omitted, it defaults to the local time zone.

           The value of $isdst returned is always 0.

              ($err,$date,$offset,$isdst,$abbrev) =
                 $tz-&gt;convert_from_gmt($date [,$to]);

           This converts a date from GMT to another time zone. If $to is given, the date is  converted  to  that
           time zone. Otherwise, it is converted to the local time zone.

              ($err,$date,$offset,$isdst,$abbrev) =
                 $tz-&gt;convert_to_local($date [,$from] [,$isdst]);
              ($err,$date,$offset,$isdst,$abbrev) =
                 $tz-&gt;convert_from_local($date [,$to] [,$isdst]);

           Similar  to  the  <b>convert_to_gmt</b>  and  <b>convert_from_gmt</b>  functions. If $from or $to are omitted, they
           default to GMT.

           If there is any ambiguity about whether $date is in DST or not  (i.e.   if  it  is  a  date  that  is
           repeated  during a time change due to the clock being moved back), the $isdst option can be passed in
           as an argument (it should be 0 or 1) to say which time to use. It is ignored in all cases where $date
           can be determined without that information.

           The $isdst value passed back is 1 if the converted date is in DST. The $offset value passed back is a
           list reference containing the offset from GMT. $abbrev passed back is the time zone abbreviation.

           Error codes are:

              0  No error
              1  Invalid arguments
              2  Invalid FROM zone
              3  Invalid TO zone
              4  Invalid date

       <b>curr_zone</b>
              $tz-&gt;curr_zone();

           This returns the system time zone. The system time zone is determined  using  the  methods  described
           below in the "DETERMINING THE SYSTEM TIME ZONE" section.

           This  is the time zone that is used by default unless the SetDate or ForceDate config variable is set
           to a different zone.

              $tz-&gt;<a href="../man1/curr_zone.1.html">curr_zone</a>(1);

           This clears the system time zone and re-determines it using the methods described below.

           The main reason to do this is if the curr_zone_methods method is used to change how the time zone  is
           determined.

       <b>curr_zone_methods</b>
              $tz-&gt;curr_zone_methods(@methods);

           This  sets  the  list  and  order  of  methods to use in determining the local time zone. The various
           methods available are listed below in the section "DETERMINING THE SYSTEM TIME ZONE".

           Some methods may require one or more arguments. For example, the  method  named  "mainvar"  takes  an
           option  that  is  the  name  of  a  variable.  The  arguments  must  be included in the @methods list
           immediately after the method name (so @methods is actually a mixture of method names and arguments).

           This method may not be used in any environment where taint checking is enabled. If  it  is,  it  will
           issue a warning, but will NOT change the method list.

       <b>date_period</b>
              $period = $tz-&gt;date_period($date,$zone,$wall_clock [,$isdst]);

           This  returns  the  period information for the given date. $date defaults to GMT, but may be given as
           local (i.e. wall clock) time if $wall_clock is non-zero. The period information is described  in  the
           periods method below.

           If a wall clock time is given, no period is returned if the wall clock time doesn't ever appear (such
           as  when  a time change results in the clock moving forward "skipping" a period of time). If the wall
           clock time appears twice (i.e. when a time change results in the clock being set  back),  the  $isdst
           variable  is  used. The standard time is used unless $isdst is non-zero.  $isdst is ignored except in
           the case where there are two possible periods.

       <b>define_abbrev</b>
              ($err,$val) = $tz-&gt;define_abbrev($abbrev,@zone);

           When encountering an abbreviation, by default, all time zones which  ever  include  the  abbreviation
           will be examine in the order given in the Date::Manip::Zones manual.

           Occasionally,  it  may  be  necessary to change the order. This is true if you are parsing dates in a
           time zone which uses an abbreviation which is also used in another time zone,  and  where  the  other
           time  zone  is  given  preference.  As  an  example,  the  abbreviation  "ADT"  will  default  to the
           "Atlantic/Bermuda" time zone. If you are in the "America/Halifax" time zone  (which  also  uses  that
           abbreviation), you may want to change the order of time zones.

           This will take an abbreviation (which must be a known abbreviation... there is no means of defining a
           totally new abbreviation) and a list of zones.  This will set the list of zones that will be checked,
           and  the  order in which they are checked, when a date is encountered with the given abbreviation. It
           is not necessary that the list include every zone that has ever used the abbreviation, but it may not
           include a zone that has never used it.

           If $abbrev is "reset", all abbreviations are reset to the standard values.  If  @zone  includes  only
           the element 'reset', the default list for $abbrev is restored.

           The following error codes are returned:

              0  No error
              1  $abbrev is not a valid abbreviation in any time zone
              2  A zone (returned as $val) is not a valid time zone
              3  A zone (returned as $val) does not use the abbreviation

           For  more  information  about  the different zones which may correspond to each abbreviation, and the
           order in which they will be examined by default, refer to the Date::Manip::Zones manual.

       <b>define_alias</b>
              $err = $tz-&gt;define_alias($alias,$zone);

           This will define a new alias (or override an existing alias). $zone must be a valid zone or an  error
           is returned.

           For  more  information  about  the  different  aliases  which  are  set  by  default,  refer  to  the
           Date::Manip::Zones manual.

           If $alias is "reset", all aliases will be reset to the standard values.  If $zone is "reset",  $alias
           will be reset to the standard value.

       <b>define_offset</b>
              ($err,$val) = $tz-&gt;define_offset($offset, [$dstflag,] @zone);

           This is similar to the define_abbrev method. When an offset is encountered, all time zones which have
           ever  included  that  offset are checked. This will defined which time zones, and in what order, they
           should be checked.

           The zones to both standard and daylight saving times which include the offset (if $dstflag  is  "std"
           or "dst") or to only one or the other.

           If $offset is "reset", all lists are reset to the default values.  If @zone includes only the element
           'reset', the default list and order is restored for $offset ($dstflag must not be given).

           The following error codes are returned:

              0  No error
              1  $offset is not a valid offset in any time zone
              2  $offset is not a valid offset in the selected
                 time (if doing "dstonly" or "stdonly")
              3  A zone (returned as $val) is not a valid time zone
              4  A zone (returned as $val) does not use the offset
              5  A zone (returned as $val) does not include the
                 offset in the selected time (if doing "dstonly"
                 or "stdonly")

              9  Offset is not a valid offset

       <b>periods</b>
              @periods = $tz-&gt;periods($zone,$year);

           This  returns  the description of all time zone periods that begin during the year given. The year is
           measured in universal (GMT) time.

           If no time zone period starts in the given year, nothing is returned.

              @periods = $tz-&gt;periods($zone,undef,$year);

           This returns all periods that begin in any year from 0001 to $year.

              @periods = $tz-&gt;periods($zone,$year0,$year1);

           This returns all periods that begin in any year from $year0 to $year1.

       <b>tzdata</b>
       <b>tzcode</b>
              $vers = $tz-&gt;tzdata();
              $vers = $tz-&gt;tzcode();

           These return the versions of the tzdata and tzcode packages used to generate the modules.

       <b>zone</b>
              $zone = $tz-&gt;zone(@args);
              @zone = $tz-&gt;zone(@args);

           This function will return a list of all zones, or the default zone, which matches all of the supplied
           information. In scalar context, it will return only the default zone. In list context, it will return
           all zones.

           @args may include any of the following items, and the order is not important.

              A zone name or alias ($alias)

              A zone abbreviation ($abbrev)

              An offset ($offset)

              A dstflag ($dstflag)

              A date ($date)

           It is NOT valid to include two of any of the items. Any time zone returned will match all of the data
           supplied.

           If an error occurs, undef is returned. If no zone matches, an empty  string,  or  an  empty  list  is
           returned.

           The order of the zones will be determined in the following way:

           If  $abbrev is given, the order of time zones will be determined by it (and $dstflag). If $dstflag is
           "std", all zones which match $abbrev in standard time  are  included,  followed  by  all  that  match
           $abbrev in saving time (but no duplication is allowed). The reverse is true if $dstflag is "dst".

           If  $abbrev  is  not given, but $offset is, $offset (and $dstflag) will determine the order given. If
           $dstflag is "std", all zones which match $offset in standard time are included, followed by all  that
           match  $offset  in  saving  time  (but no duplication is allowed). The reverse is true if $dstflag is
           "dst".

           If $date is given, only zones in which $date will appear in a zone that matches all other information
           are given. $date is a wall clock time.

           If no $zone, $abbrev, or $offset are entered, the local time zone may be returned  (unless  $date  is
           entered, and it doesn't exist in the local time zone).

           NOTE:  there  is  one  important  thing  to note with respect to $dstflag when you are working with a
           timezone expressed as an offset and a date is passed in. In this case, the default value of  $dstflag
           is  "dst" (NOT "stdonly"), and you probably never want to pass in a value of "std" (though passing in
           "stdonly" is okay).

           For standard offsets (with no minute component), there is always a standard  timezone  which  matches
           that  offset.  For example, the timezone "+0100" matches the timezone "Etc/GMT+01", so you will never
           get a timezone in daylight saving time if $dstflag is "std".

           If you want to pass in a date of 2001-07-01-00:00:00 and an timezone of "+0100" and you want to get a
           timezone that refers to that date as a daylight saving time date, you must use the $dstflag of  "dst"
           (or "dstonly").

           Because this is almost always the behavior desired, when a zone is passed in as an offset, and a date
           is passed in, the default $dstflag is "dst" instead of "std". In all other situations, the default is
           still "std".

           If the timezone is expressed as an abbreviation, this problem does not occur.

</pre><h4><b>TIME</b> <b>ZONE</b> <b>INFORMATION</b> <b>IN</b> <b>DATE::MANIP</b></h4><pre>
       Date::Manip makes use of three potentially different time zones when working with a date.

       The  first  time  zone  that  may  be used is the actual local time zone.  This is the time zone that the
       computer is actually running in.

       The second time zone is the working time zone. Usually, you will want the default time  zone  to  be  the
       local time zone, but occasionally, you may want the default time zone to be different.

       The  third  time  zone is the actual time zone that was parsed, or set, for a date. If a date contains no
       time zone information, it will default to the working time zone.

       The local time zone is determined using the methods described in the following section. Methods exist for
       locating the zone in one of the system configuration files, determining it by running a  system  command,
       or  by  looking it up in the registry (for Windows operating systems).  If all of these methods fail, the
       local time zone may be set using either the $::TZ or $ENV{TZ} variables. Please note  that  these  should
       ONLY be used to set the actual local time zone.

       If  you  are  running  in one time zone, but you want to force dates to be specified in an alternate time
       zone by default, you need to set the working time zone. The working time zone defaults to the local  time
       zone,  but  this  can  be  changed  using  either the SetDate or ForceDate config variables. Refer to the
       Date::Manip::Config manual for more information.

       Finally, when a date is actually parsed, if it contains any time zone information, the date is stored  in
       that time zone.

</pre><h4><b>DETERMINING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>SYSTEM</b> <b>TIME</b> <b>ZONE</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  a  large  number  of ways available for determining the time zone. Some or all of them may be
       checked. A list of methods to use is provided by default, and may be overridden by the  curr_zone_methods
       function  described  above.  To override the default order and/or list of methods, just pass in a list of
       method names (with arguments where necessary), and only those methods will be  done,  and  in  the  order
       given.

       The following methods are available:

          Method     Argument(s)    Procedure
          ======     ===========    =========

          main       VAR            The main variable named VAR is
                                    checked. E.g. "main TZ" checks
                                    the variable $::TZ .

          env        TYPE VAR       The named environment variable
                                    is checked and the type of
                                    data stored there (TYPE can
                                    be 'zone' or 'offset' which
                                    is the number of seconds from
                                    UTC).

          file       FILE           Look in the given file for any
                                    one of the following case
                                    insensitive lines:
                                       ZONE
                                       tz = ZONE
                                       zone = ZONE
                                       timezone = ZONE
                                    ZONE may be quoted (single or
                                    double) and whitespace is
                                    ignored (except that underscores
                                    in the zone name may be replaced
                                    by whitespace on some OSes). If
                                    the entire line is a zone, it must
                                    be the first non-blank non-comment
                                    line in the file.

          command    COMMAND        Runs a command which produces
                                    a time zone as the output.

          cmdfield   COMMAND N      Runs a command which produces
                                    whitespace separated fields,
                                    the Nth one containing the
                                    time zone (fields are numbered
                                    starting at 0, or from the
                                    end starting at -1).

          gmtoff                    Uses the current offset from
                                    GMT to come up with a best guess.

          tzdata     FILE DIR       This uses a system config file that
                                    contains a pointer to the local tzdata
                                    files to  determine the timezone.  On
                                    many operating systems, use:

                                    tzdata <a href="file:/etc/localtime">/etc/localtime</a> <a href="file:/usr/share/zoneinfo">/usr/share/zoneinfo</a>

                                    FILE is the system file.  DIR is the
                                    directory where the tzdata files are stored.

                                    The config file is either a link to a file
                                    in the tzdata directory or a copy of one
                                    of the files.

          registry                  Look up the value in the
                                    Windows registry. This is only
                                    available to hosts running a
                                    Windows operating system.

       Note  that the "main" and "env" methods should only be used to specify the actual time zone the system is
       running in. Use the SetDate and ForceDate config variables to specify an alternate  time  zone  that  you
       want to work in.

       By default, the following methods are checked (in the order given) on Unix systems:

          main     TZ
          env      zone TZ
          file     /etc/TIMEZONE
          file     <a href="file:/etc/timezone">/etc/timezone</a>
          file     /etc/sysconfig/clock
          file     /etc/default/init
          command  "<a href="file:/bin/date">/bin/date</a> +%Z"
          command  "<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?date">/usr/bin/date</a> +%Z"
          command  "/usr/local/bin/date +%Z"
          cmdfield <a href="file:/bin/date">/bin/date</a>             -2
          cmdfield <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?date">/usr/bin/date</a>         -2
          cmdfield /usr/local/bin/date   -2
          command  "<a href="file:/bin/date">/bin/date</a> +%z"
          command  "<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?date">/usr/bin/date</a> +%z"
          command  "/usr/local/bin/date +%z"
          tzdata   <a href="file:/etc/localtime">/etc/localtime</a> <a href="file:/usr/share/zoneinfo">/usr/share/zoneinfo</a>
          gmtoff

       The default methods for Windows systems are:

          main     TZ
          env      zone TZ
          registry
          gmtoff

       The default methods for VMS systems are:

          main     TZ
          env      zone TZ
          env      zone SYS$TIMEZONE_NAME
          env      zone UCX$TZ
          env      zone TCPIP$TZ
          env      zone MULTINET_TIMEZONE
          env      offset SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL
          gmtoff

       The default methods for all other systems are:

          main     TZ
          env      zone TZ
          gmtoff

       If anyone wants better support for a specific OS, please contact me and we'll coordinate adding it.

       In all cases, the value returned from the method may be any of the following:

          the full name of a time zone (e.g. America/New_York)
          or an alias

          an abbreviation (e.g. EDT) which will be used to
          determine the zone if possible

          an offset (+hh, +hhmn, +hh:mm, +hh:mm:ss) from GMT

       The  Date::Manip::Zones  module contains information about the time zones and aliases available, and what
       time zones contain the abbreviations.

</pre><h4><b>DESIGN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       The design decisions made in writing this module may cause some questions (and probably complaints).  The
       time zone modules are all generated using scripts (included in the Date::Manip  distribution)  which  use
       the standard tzdata tools to parse the tzdata files and store that information in perl modules.

       I'd  like to address some of them, to avoid answering some of the "why did you do it that way" remarks. I
       do welcome discussion about these decisions... but preferably after you understand  why  those  decisions
       were made so that that we have an informed basis to begin a discussion.

       <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>use</b> <b>existing</b> <b>zoneinfo</b> <b>files</b>
           Some  people  will probably think that I should have written an interface to the zoneinfo files which
           are distributed with most operating systems.  Although I considered doing that, I rejected  the  idea
           for two reasons.

           First,  not  all  operating  systems  come  with  the  zoneinfo  databases in a user accessible state
           (Microsoft for example).  Even those that do include them store the information  in  various  formats
           and locations.  In order to bypass all that, I have included the data directly in these modules.

           Second,  as I was doing my initial investigations into this, I ran into a bug in the Solaris zoneinfo
           tools (long since fixed I'm sure).  I decided then that I didn't want to depend on an  implementation
           where I could not control and fix the bugs.

       <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>native</b> <b>tzdata</b> <b>files</b>
           Another decision people may question is that I parse the tzdata files and store the data from them in
           a  large  number  of perl modules instead of creating an interface to the tzdata files directly. This
           was done solely for the sake of speed.  Date::Manip is already a slow module.  I didn't want to  slow
           it  down  further  by  doing  the  complex  parsing  required  to  interpret  the  tzdata files while
           manipulating dates.  By storing the data in these modules, there is little or no parsing  done  while
           using  Date::Manip modules. It costs a little disk space to store this information... but very little
           of it is actually loaded at runtime (time zone data is only loaded when the  time  zone  is  actually
           referred to), so I feel it's a good tradeoff.

       <b>Why</b> <b>store</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>files</b>
           The  data  from  the  native tzdata files are parsed and stored in two sets of modules. These include
           almost 500 Date::Manip::Offset::* modules and almost 450 Date::Manip::TZ::* modules.

           I note that on my linux box, <a href="file:/usr/share/zoneinfo">/usr/share/zoneinfo</a> (which contains data files generated from the tzdata
           files) contains over 1700 files, so I'm not doing anything "new" by breaking up the information  into
           separate  files.  And doing so has a huge impact on performance... it is not necessary to load and/or
           manipulate data from time zones which are not in use.

           The minute I made the decision to distribute the timezone information myself, as opposed to using the
           system version, it was a given that there would be a lot of files.

           These modules are loaded only when the time zone or offset is actually used, so,  unless  dates  from
           around the world are being parsed, only a very small number of these modules will actually be loaded.
           In  many  applications,  only a single TZ module will be loaded. If parsing dates which have timezone
           information stored as offsets, one or two Offset modules will also be loaded.

       <b>The</b> <b>disk</b> <b>space</b> <b>seems</b> <b>excessive</b>
           Currently, the disk usage of the perl files is around 9 MB. Total disk usage for  <a href="file:/usr/share/zoneinfo">/usr/share/zoneinfo</a>
           on my computer is around 4 MB. There are a couple of differences.

           The primary difference is that the zoneinfo files are stored in a binary (and hence, more compressed)
           version, where the perl modules have all the data in pure text.

           Since  these are all automatically generated and used, it may be beneficial to store the data in some
           packed binary format instead of the fully expanded text form that is currently  in  use.  This  would
           decrease  the  disk  space usage, and might improve performance. However, the performance improvement
           would happen only once per timezone, and would make for  more  complicated  code,  so  I'm  not  very
           interested in pursuing this.

           Another  aspect  of  the  current  modules  is  that they all include pod documentation. Although not
           necessary, this allows users to easily see what modules handle which time zones, and that's nice.  It
           also  allows  me to use pod_coverage tests for the module which is a nice check to make sure that the
           documentation is accurate.

           All told, I don't consider the disk usage excessive at all.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>PROBLEMS</b> <b>OR</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Zone</b>
           When using Date::Manip, when the module is initialized, it must be able to determine the  local  time
           zone. If it fails to do so, an error will occur:

              Unable to determine Time Zone

           and the script will exit.

           In  the  past,  this  was the most common problem with using Date::Manip .  With the release of 6.00,
           this problem should be significantly less common. If you do get  this  error,  please  refer  to  the
           section above DETERMINING THE SYSTEM TIME ZONE for information about determining the local time zone.
           I  am  also  interested  in hearing about this so that I can update the default list of methods to be
           able to determine the local time zone better.

       <b>Asia/Jerusalem</b> <b>time</b> <b>zone</b>
           The Asia/Jerusalem time zone has a non-standard way of specifying  the  start  and  end  of  Daylight
           Saving Time based on the Hebrew calendar.

           As  a  result,  there is no way to specify a simple rule to define time zone changes for all years in
           the future. As such, this module supports all time zone changes currently specified in  the  zoneinfo
           database  (which  currently  goes  to  the  year  2037) but does not attempt to correctly handle zone
           changes beyond that date. As a result, Date::Manip should not be used to parse dates in the Jerusalem
           time zone that are far enough in the future that information is not included in the  current  version
           of the zoneinfo database.

       <b>LMT</b> <b>and</b> <b>zzz</b> <b>abbreviations</b>
           Both  the  LMT  and  zzz  abbreviations are used in the zoneinfo databases.  LMT is use for most time
           zones for the times before the Gregorian calendar was adopted, and zzz is used for a  few  where  the
           time  zone  was created and no description of dates prior to that are supported. Both LMT and zzz are
           basically ignored in parsing dates (because there is no reasonable way to determine which  zone  they
           are referring to), and will be treated as the local time zone regardless.
