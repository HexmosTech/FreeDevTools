</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Time::Format - Easy-to-use date/time formatting.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This is version 1.16 of Time::Format, February 19, 2020.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Time::Format qw(%time %strftime %manip);

        $time{$format}
        $time{$format, $unixtime}

        print "Today is $time{'yyyy/mm/dd'}\n";
        print "Yesterday was $time{'yyyy/mm/dd', time-24*60*60}\n";
        print "The time is $time{'hh:mm:ss'}\n";
        print "Another time is $time{'H:mm am tz', $another_time}\n";
        print "Timestamp: $time{'yyyymmdd.hhmmss.mmm'}\n";

       %time also accepts Date::Manip strings and DateTime objects:

        $dm = Date::Manip::ParseDate('last monday');
        print "Last monday was $time{'Month d, yyyy', $dm}";
        $dt = DateTime-&gt;new (....);
        print "Here's another date: $time{'m/d/yy', $dt}";

       It also accepts most ISO-8601 date/time strings:

        $t = '2005/10/31T17:11:09';   # date separator: / or - or .
        $t = '2005-10-31 17.11.09';   # in-between separator: T or _ or space
        $t = '20051031_171109';       # time separator: : or .
        $t = '20051031171109';        # separators may be omitted
        $t = '2005/10/31';            # date-only is okay
        $t = '17:11:09';              # time-only is okay
        # But not:
        $t = '20051031';              # date-only without separators
        $t = '171109';                # time-only without separators
        # ...because those look like epoch time numbers.

       %strftime works like POSIX's "strftime", if you like those "%"-formats.

        $strftime{$format}
        $strftime{$format, $unixtime}
        $strftime{$format, $sec,$min,$hour, $mday,$mon,$year, $wday,$yday,$isdst}

        print "POSIXish: $strftime{'%A, %B %d, %Y', 0,0,0,12,11,95,2}\n";
        print "POSIXish: $strftime{'%A, %B %d, %Y', 1054866251}\n";
        print "POSIXish: $strftime{'%A, %B %d, %Y'}\n";       # current time

       %manip works like Date::Manip's "UnixDate" function.

        $manip{$format};
        $manip{$format, $when};

        print "Date::Manip: $manip{'%m/%d/%Y'}\n";            # current time
        print "Date::Manip: $manip{'%m/%d/%Y','last Tuesday'}\n";

       These can also be used as standalone functions:

        use Time::Format qw(time_format time_strftime time_manip);

        print "Today is ", time_format('yyyy/mm/dd', $some_time), "\n";
        print "POSIXish: ", time_strftime('%A %B %d, %Y',$some_time), "\n";
        print "Date::Manip: ", time_manip('%m/%d/%Y',$some_time), "\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module creates global pseudovariables which format dates and times, according to formatting codes
       you pass to them in strings.

       The %time formatting codes are designed to be easy to remember and use, and to take up just as many
       characters as the output time value whenever possible.  For example, the four-digit year code is
       ""yyyy"", the three-letter month abbreviation is ""Mon"".

       The nice thing about having a variable-like interface instead of function calls is that the values can be
       used inside of strings (as well as outside of strings in ordinary expressions).  Dates are frequently
       used within strings (log messages, output, data records, etc.), so having the ability to interpolate them
       directly is handy.

       Perl allows arbitrary expressions within curly braces of a hash, even when that hash is being
       interpolated into a string.  This allows you to do computations on the fly while formatting times and
       inserting them into strings.  See the "yesterday" example above.

       The format strings are designed with programmers in mind.  What do you need most frequently?  4-digit
       year, month, day, 24-based hour, minute, second -- usually with leading zeroes.  These six are the
       easiest formats to use and remember in Time::Format: "yyyy", "mm", "dd", "hh", "mm", "ss".  Variants on
       these formats follow a simple and consistent formula.  This module is for everyone who is weary of trying
       to remember <u><b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3)</u>'s arcane codes, or of endlessly writing "$t[4]++; $t[5]+=1900" as you manually
       format times or dates.

       Note that "mm" (and related codes) are used both for months and minutes.  This is a feature.  %time
       resolves the ambiguity by examining other nearby formatting codes.  If it's in the context of a year or a
       day, "month" is assumed.  If in the context of an hour or a second, "minute" is assumed.

       The format strings are not meant to encompass every date/time need ever conceived.  But how often do you
       need the day of the year (strftime's %j) or the week number (strftime's %W)?

       For capabilities that %time does not provide, %strftime provides an interface to POSIX's "strftime", and
       %manip provides an interface to the Date::Manip module's "UnixDate" function.

       If the companion module Time::Format_XS is also installed, Time::Format will detect and use it.  This
       will result in a significant speed increase for %time and "time_format".

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       time
            $time{$format}
            $time{$format,$time_value};

           Formats  a  unix  time  number  (seconds  since  the  epoch),  DateTime object, stringified DateTime,
           Date::Manip string, or ISO-8601 string, according to the specified format.  If the time expression is
           omitted, the current time is used.  The format string may contain any of the following:

               yyyy       4-digit year
               yy         2-digit year

               m          1- or 2-digit month, 1-12
               mm         2-digit month, 01-12
               ?m         month with leading space if &lt; 10

               Month      full month name, mixed-case
               MONTH      full month name, uppercase
               month      full month name, lowercase
               Mon        3-letter month abbreviation, mixed-case
               MON  mon   ditto, uppercase and lowercase versions

               d          day number, 1-31
               dd         day number, 01-31
               ?d         day with leading space if &lt; 10
               th         day suffix (st, nd, rd, or th)
               TH         uppercase suffix

               Weekday    weekday name, mixed-case
               WEEKDAY    weekday name, uppercase
               weekday    weekday name, lowercase
               Day        3-letter weekday name, mixed-case
               DAY  day   ditto, uppercase and lowercase versions

               h          hour, 0-23
               hh         hour, 00-23
               ?h         hour, 0-23 with leading space if &lt; 10

               H          hour, 1-12
               HH         hour, 01-12
               ?H         hour, 1-12 with leading space if &lt; 10

               m          minute, 0-59
               mm         minute, 00-59
               ?m         minute, 0-59 with leading space if &lt; 10

               s          second, 0-59
               ss         second, 00-59
               ?s         second, 0-59 with leading space if &lt; 10
               mmm        millisecond, 000-999
               uuuuuu     microsecond, 000000-999999

               am   a.m.  The string "am" or "pm" (second form with periods)
               pm   p.m.  same as "am" or "a.m."
               AM   A.M.  same as "am" or "a.m." but uppercase
               PM   P.M.  same as "AM" or "A.M."

               tz         time zone abbreviation

           Millisecond and microsecond require Time::HiRes, otherwise they'll always be zero.  Timezone requires
           POSIX, otherwise it'll be the empty string.  The second codes ("s", "ss", "?s") can be 60  or  61  in
           rare circumstances (leap seconds, if your system supports such).

           Anything  in  the format string other than the above patterns is left intact.  Any character preceded
           by a backslash is left alone and not used for any part of a format code.  See the  "QUOTING"  section
           for more details.

           For  the most part, each of the above formatting codes takes up as much space as the output string it
           generates.  The exceptions are the codes whose output is variable length:  "Weekday",  "Month",  time
           zone, and the single-character codes.

           The  mixed-case "Month", "Mon", "Weekday", and "Day" codes return the name of the month or weekday in
           the preferred case representation for the locale currently in effect.  Thus  in  an  English-speaking
           locale,  the  seventh  month  would  be  "July"  (uppercase first letter, lowercase rest); while in a
           French-speaking locale, it would be "juillet" (all lowercase).  See the "QUOTING" section for ways to
           control the case of month/weekday names.

           Note that the ""mm"", ""m"", and ""?m"" formats are ambiguous.  %time  tries  to  guess  whether  you
           meant  "month"  or  "minute"  based  on  nearby  characters  in the format string.  Thus, a format of
           ""yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss"" is correctly parsed as "year month day, hour minute second".  If %time cannot
           determine whether you meant "month" or "minute", it leaves the "mm", "m", or "?m"  untranslated.   To
           remove the ambiguity, you can use the following codes:

               m{on}        month, 1-12
               mm{on}       month, 01-12
               ?m{on}       month, 1-12 with leading space if &lt; 10

               m{in}        minute, 0-59
               mm{in}       minute, 00-59
               ?m{in}       minute, 0-59 with leading space if &lt; 10

           In other words, append ""{on}"" or ""{in}"" to make ""m"", ""mm"", or ""?m"" unambiguous.

       strftime
            $strftime{$format, $sec,$min,$hour, $mday,$mon,$year, $wday,$yday,$isdst}
            $strftime{$format, $unixtime}
            $strftime{$format}

           For  those  who  prefer  strftime's  weird  % formats, or who need POSIX compliance, or who need week
           numbers or other features %time does not provide.

       manip
            $manip{$format};
            $manip{$format,$when};

           Provides an interface to the Date::Manip module's "UnixDate" function.  This function is rather slow,
           but can parse a very wide variety of date input.  See the Date::Manip module for  details  about  the
           inputs accepted.

           If  you  want  to  use  the  %time  codes,  but  need  the  input  flexibility of %manip, you can use
           Date::Manip's "ParseDate" function:

            print "$time{'yyyymmdd', ParseDate('last sunday')}";

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       time_format
            time_format($format);
            time_format($format, $unix_time);

           This is a function interface to %time.  It accepts the same formatting codes and everything.  This is
           provided for people who want their function calls to <u>look</u> like function calls, not  hashes.  :-)  The
           following two are equivalent:

            $x = $time{'yyyy/mm/dd'};
            $x = time_format('yyyy/mm/dd');

       time_strftime
            time_strftime($format, $sec,$min,$hour, $mday,$mon,$year, $wday,$yday,$isdst);
            time_strftime($format, $unixtime);
            time_strftime($format);

           This  is a function interface to %strftime.  It simply calls POSIX::"strftime", but it does provide a
           bit of an advantage over calling "strftime" directly, in that you can pass the time as  a  unix  time
           (seconds since the epoch), or omit it in order to get the current time.

       time_manip
            manip($format);
            manip($format,$when);

           This  is  a  function interface to %manip.  It calls Date::Manip::"UnixDate" under the hood.  It does
           not provide much of an advantage over calling "UnixDate" directly, except that you can omit the $when
           parameter in order to get the current time.

</pre><h4><b>QUOTING</b></h4><pre>
       This section applies to the format strings used by %time and "time_format" only.

       Sometimes it is necessary to suppress expansion of some  format  characters  in  a  format  string.   For
       example:

           $time{'Hour: hh; Minute: mm{in}; Second: ss'};

       In  the  above expression, the "H" in "Hour" would be expanded, as would the "d" in "Second".  The result
       would be something like:

           8our: 08; Minute: 10; Secon17: 30

       It would not be a good solution to break the above statement out into three calls to %time:

           "Hour: $time{hh}; Minute: $time{'mm{in}'}; Second: $time{ss}"

       because the time could change from one call to the next, which would be a problem when the  numbers  roll
       over (for example, a split second after 7:59:59).

       For this reason, you can escape individual format codes with a backslash:

           $time{'\Hour: hh; Minute: mm{in}; Secon\d: ss'};

       Note  that  with  double-quoted  (and  qq//)  strings,  the backslash must be doubled, because Perl first
       interpolates the string:

           $time{"\\Hour: hh; Minute: mm{in}; Secon\\d: ss"};

       For added convenience, Time::Format simulates  Perl's  built-in  \Q  and  \E  inline  quoting  operators.
       Anything in a string between a \Q and \E will not be interpolated as any part of any formatting code:

           $time{'\QHour:\E hh; \QMinute:\E mm{in}; \QSecond:\E ss'};

       Again, within interpolated strings, the backslash must be doubled, or else Perl will interpret and remove
       the \Q...\E sequence before Time::Format gets it:

           $time{"\\QHour:\\E hh; \\QMinute:\\E mm{in}; \\QSecond\\E: ss"};

       Time::Format  also recognizes and simulates the \U, \L, \u, and \l sequences.  This is really only useful
       for finer control of the Month, Mon, Weekday, and Day formats.  For example, in some locales,  the  month
       names are all-lowercase by convention.  At the start of a sentence, you may want to ensure that the first
       character is uppercase:

           $time{'\uMonth \Qis the finest month of all.'};

       Again, be sure to use \Q, and be sure to double the backslashes in interpolated strings, otherwise you'll
       get something ugly like:

           July i37 ste fine37t july of all.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNATIONALIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  I18N::Langinfo  module  is  available,  Time::Format  will return weekday and month names in the
       language appropriate for the current locale.  If not, English names will be used.

       Programmers in non-English locales may want to provide an alias to %time in their own preferred language.
       This can be done by assigning "\%time" to a typeglob:

           # French
           use Time::Format;
           use vars '%temps';  *temps = \%time;
           print "C'est aujourd'hui le $temps{'d Month'}\n";

           # German
           use Time::Format;
           use vars '%zeit';   *zeit = \%time;
           print "Heutiger Tag ist $zeit{'d.m.yyyy'}\n";

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       The following symbols are exported into your namespace by default:

        %time
        time_format

       The following symbols are available for import into your namespace:

        %strftime
        %manip
        time_strftime
        time_manip

       The ":all" tag will import all of these into your namespace.  Example:

        use Time::Format ':all';

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The format string used by %time must not have  $;  as  a  substring  anywhere.   $;  (by  default,  ASCII
       character  28,  or 1C hex) is used to separate values passed to the tied hash, and thus Time::Format will
       interpret your format string to be two or more arguments if it contains $;.  The  "time_format"  function
       does not have this limitation.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
        Time::Local
        I18N::Langinfo, if you want non-English locales to work.
        POSIX, if you choose to use %strftime or want the C&lt;tz&gt; format to work.
        Time::HiRes, if you want the C&lt;mmm&gt; and C&lt;uuuuuu&gt; time formats to work.
        Date::Manip, if you choose to use %manip.

        Time::Format_XS is optional but will make C&lt;%time&gt; and C&lt;time_format&gt;
            much faster.  The version of Time::Format_XS installed must match
            the version of Time::Format installed; otherwise Time::Format will
            not use it (and will issue a warning).
