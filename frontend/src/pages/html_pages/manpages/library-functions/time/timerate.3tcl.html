</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>timerate</b>  command  does  calibrated  performance measurement of a Tcl command or script, <u>script</u>. The
       <u>script</u> should be written so that it can be executed multiple times  during  the  performance  measurement
       process.   Time  is measured in elapsed time using the finest timer resolution as possible, not CPU time;
       if <u>script</u> interacts with the OS, the cost of that interaction is included.  This command may be  used  to
       provide  information  as  to  how  well  a  script  or  Tcl command is performing, and can help determine
       bottlenecks and fine-tune application performance.

       The first and second form will evaluate <u>script</u> until the interval <u>time</u> given in milliseconds elapses,  or
       for 1000 milliseconds (1 second) if <u>time</u> is not specified.

       The  parameter  <u>max-count</u>  could  additionally  impose  a  further  restriction  by the maximal number of
       iterations to evaluate the script.  If <u>max-count</u> is specified, the evaluation will stop either this count
       of iterations is reached or the time is exceeded.

       It will then return a canonical Tcl-list of the form:

              <b>0.095977</b> <b>µs/#</b> <b>52095836</b> <b>#</b> <b>10419167</b> <b>#/sec</b> <b>5000.000</b> <b>net-ms</b>

       which indicates:

       •  the average amount of time required per iteration, in microseconds ([<b>lindex</b> $result 0])

       •  the count how many times it was executed ([<b>lindex</b> $result 2])

       •  the estimated rate per second ([<b>lindex</b> $result 4])

       •  the estimated real execution time without measurement overhead ([<b>lindex</b> $result 6])

       The following options may be supplied to the <b>timerate</b> command:

       <b>-calibrate</b>
              To measure very fast scripts as exactly as possible, a calibration process may be  required.   The
              <b>-calibrate</b>  option is used to calibrate <b>timerate</b> itself, calculating the estimated overhead of the
              given script as the default overhead for future invocations of the <b>timerate</b> command. If  the  <u>time</u>
              parameter is not specified, the calibrate procedure runs for up to 10 seconds.

              Note that the calibration process is not thread safe in the current implementation.

       <b>-overhead</b> <u>estimate</u>
              The  <b>-overhead</b>  parameter  supplies  an  estimate  (in microseconds, which may be a floating point
              number) of the measurement overhead of each iteration of the tested script. This quantity will  be
              subtracted  from the measured time prior to reporting results. This can be useful for removing the
              cost of interpreter state reset commands from the script being measured.

       <b>-direct</b>
              The <b>-direct</b> option causes direct execution of the  supplied  script,  without  compilation,  in  a
              manner  similar  to  the <b>time</b> command. It can be used to measure the cost of <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b>, of the
              invocation of canonical lists, and of the uncompiled versions of bytecoded commands.

       As opposed to the <b>time</b> command, which runs the tested script  for  a  fixed  number  of  iterations,  the
       <b>timerate</b> command runs it for a fixed time.  Additionally, the compiled variant of the script will be used
       during  the entire measurement, as if the script were part of a compiled procedure, if the <b>-direct</b> option
       is not specified. The fixed time period and possibility of compilation allow for more precise results and
       prevent very long execution times by slow scripts, making it practical for measuring scripts with  highly
       uncertain execution times.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Estimate  how  fast  it  takes for a simple Tcl <b>for</b> loop (including operations on variable <u>i</u>) to count to
       ten:

              <u>#</u> <u>calibrate</u>
              <b>timerate</b> -calibrate {}

              <u>#</u> <u>measure</u>
              <b>timerate</b> { for {set i 0} {$i&lt;10} {incr i} {} } 5000

       Estimate how fast it takes for a simple Tcl <b>for</b> loop, ignoring the overhead  of  the  management  of  the
       variable that controls the loop:

              <u>#</u> <u>calibrate</u> <u>for</u> <u>overhead</u> <u>of</u> <u>variable</u> <u>operations</u>
              set i 0; <b>timerate</b> -calibrate {expr {$i&lt;10}; incr i} 1000

              <u>#</u> <u>measure</u>
              <b>timerate</b> {
                  for {set i 0} {$i&lt;10} {incr i} {}
              } 5000

       Estimate  the  speed of calculating the hour of the day using <b>clock</b> <b>format</b> only, ignoring overhead of the
       portion of the script that prepares the time for it to calculate:

              <u>#</u> <u>calibrate</u>
              <b>timerate</b> -calibrate {}

              <u>#</u> <u>estimate</u> <u>overhead</u>
              set tm 0
              set ovh [lindex [<b>timerate</b> {
                  incr tm [expr {24*60*60}]
              }] 0]

              <u>#</u> <u>measure</u> <u>using</u> <u>estimated</u> <u>overhead</u>
              set tm 0
              <b>timerate</b> -overhead $ovh {
                  clock format $tm -format %H
                  incr tm [expr {24*60*60}]; # overhead for this is ignored
              } 5000
