</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Time::Mock - shift and scale time

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Speed up your <b>sleep()</b>, <b>alarm()</b>, and <b>time()</b> calls.

         use Time::Mock throttle =&gt; 100;
         use Your::Code;

</pre><h4><b>ABOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Test::MockTime is nice, but doesn't allow you to accelerate the timestep and doesn't deal with
       Time::HiRes or give you any way to change the time across forks.

       TODO: replace Time::HiRes functions with wrappers

       TODO: finish the interfaces to real time/sleep/alarm

</pre><h4><b>Replaces</b></h4><pre>
       These core functions are replaced.

       Eventually, much of the same bits from Time::HiRes will be correspondingly overwritten.

       time
       localtime
       gmtime
       sleep
           Sleeps for 1/$throttle.

       alarm
           Alarm happens in 1/$throttle.

</pre><h4><b>Class</b> <b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
       These are the knobs on your time machine, but note that it is probably best to adjust them only once: see
       caveats.  For convenience, <b>import()</b> takes will call these methods with each key in its argument list.

         perl -MTime::Mock=throttle,600,set,"2009-11-01 00:59" dst_bug.pl

   <b>throttle</b>
       Get or set the throttle.

         Time::Mock-&gt;<a href="../man10_000/throttle.10_000.html">throttle</a>(10_000);

   <b>offset</b>
       Get or set the offset.

         Time::Mock-&gt;<a href="../man120/offset.120.html">offset</a>(120);

   <b>set</b>
       Set   the   time   to   a   given   value.   This  may  be  a  numeric  time  or  anything  parseable  by
       <b>Date::Parse::str2time()</b> (you need to install Date::Parse to enable this.)

         Time::Mock-&gt;set("2009-11-01 00:59");

</pre><h4><b>Caveats</b></h4><pre>
       This package remembers the actual system time when it was loaded and makes adjustments from there.

       Future versions might change this behavior if I can think of a good reason and scheme for that.

   <b>forks</b> <b>and</b> <b>threads</b>
       The throttle value will hold across forks, but there is no  support  for  propagating  changes  to  child
       processes.  So, set the knobs only before you fork!

       Don't ask about threads unless you're asking about me applying your patch thanks.

   <b>Networking</b> <b>and</b> <b>System</b> <b>stuff</b>
       We're only lying about the clock inside of Perl, not magically messing with the universe.

   <b>Time</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>is</b> <b>Dangerous</b>
       I suggest that you set the knobs at <b>import()</b> and don't mess with them after that unless you're well aware
       of how your code is using time.

       Messing  with the throttle during runtime could also give your code the illusion of time going backwards.
       If your code tries to do math with the return values of <b>time()</b> before and after a slow-down, there  could
       be trouble.

       Changing  the  throttle  while  an <b>alarm()</b> is set won't change the original alarm time.  There would be a
       similar caveat about <b>sleep()</b> if I hadn't already mentioned forks ;-)

       Finally, don't ever let your past self see your future self.
