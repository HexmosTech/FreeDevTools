       MooX::late - easily translate Moose code to Moo

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          package Foo;
          use Moo;
          use MooX::late;
          has bar =&gt; (is =&gt; "ro", isa =&gt; "Str", default =&gt; "MacLaren's Pub");

       (Examples for Moo roles in section below.)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Moo is a light-weight object oriented programming framework which aims to be compatible with Moose. It
       does this by detecting when Moose has been loaded, and automatically "inflating" its classes and roles to
       full Moose classes and roles. This way, Moo classes can consume Moose roles, Moose classes can extend Moo
       classes, and so forth.

       However, the surface syntax of Moo differs somewhat from Moose. For example the "isa" option when
       defining attributes in Moose must be either a string or a blessed Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object; but
       in Moo must be a coderef. These differences in surface syntax make porting code from Moose to Moo
       potentially tricky. MooX::late provides some assistance by enabling a slightly more Moosey surface
       syntax.

       MooX::late does the following:

       1.  Supports "isa =&gt; $stringytype".

       2.  Supports "does =&gt; $rolename" .

       3.  Supports "lazy_build =&gt; 1".

       4.  Exports "blessed" and "confess" functions to your namespace.

       5.  Handles native attribute traits.

       Five  features.  It is not the aim of "MooX::late" to make every aspect of Moo behave exactly identically
       to Moose. It's just going after the low-hanging fruit. So it does five things right now,  and  I  promise
       that future versions will never do more than seven.

       Previous  releases of MooX::late added support for "coerce =&gt; 1" and "default =&gt; $nonref". These features
       have now been added to Moo itself, so MooX::late no longer has to deal with them.

   <b>Use</b> <b>in</b> <b>Moo::Roles</b>
       MooX::late should work in Moo::Roles, with no particular caveats.

          package MyRole;
          use Moo::Role;
          use MooX::late;

       Package::Variant can be used to build the Moo equivalent of parameterized roles. MooX::late  should  work
       in roles built with Package::Variant.

          use Package::Variant
             importing =&gt; [ qw( Moo::Role MooX::late ) ],
             subs      =&gt; [ qw( has with ) ];

   <b>Type</b> <b>constraints</b>
       Type  constraint  strings  are  interpreted  using  Type::Parser,  using  the type constraints defined in
       Types::Standard. This provides a very slight superset of Moose's type constraint syntax and built-in type
       constraints.

       Any unrecognized string that looks like it might  be  a  class  name  is  interpreted  as  a  class  type
       constraint.

   <b>Subclassing</b>
       MooX::late  is  designed  to  be  reasonably  easy  to  subclass.  There  are comments in the source code
       explaining hooks for extensibility.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Please report any bugs to &lt;<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html">http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html</a>?Queue=MooX-late&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       "MooX::late" uses Types::Standard to check type constraints.

       "MooX::late" uses Sub::HandlesVia to provide native attribute traits support.

       The following modules bring additional Moose functionality to Moo, beyond what MooX::late offers:

       •   MooX::Override - support override/super

       •   MooX::Augment - support augment/inner

       MooX allows you to load Moo plus multiple MooX extension modules in a single line.
