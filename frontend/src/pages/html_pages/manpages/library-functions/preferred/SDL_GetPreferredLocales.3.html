</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_GetPreferredLocales - Report the user's preferred locale.

</pre><h4><b>HEADER</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Defined in SDL3/SDL_locale.h

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>"SDL3/SDL.h"</b>

       <b>SDL_Locale</b> <b>**</b> <b>SDL_GetPreferredLocales(int</b> <b>*count);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Returned language strings are in the format xx, where 'xx' is an ISO-639 language specifier (such as "en"
       for  English,  "de"  for  German,  etc).  Country strings are in the format YY, where "YY" is an ISO-3166
       country code (such as "US" for the United States, "CA" for Canada, etc). Country might be NULL if there's
       no specific guidance on them (so you might get { "en", "US" } for American English, but {  "en",  NULL  }
       means "English language, generically"). Language strings are never NULL, except to terminate the array.

       Please note that not all of these strings are 2 characters; some are three or more.

       The  returned  list  of  locales are in the order of the user's preference. For example, a German citizen
       that is fluent in US English and knows enough Japanese to navigate around Tokyo might have a list like: {
       "de", "en_US", "jp", NULL }. Someone from England might prefer British English (where "color" is  spelled
       "colour", etc), but will settle for anything like it: { "en_GB", "en", NULL }.

       This function returns NULL on error, including when the platform does not supply this information at all.

       This  might  be  a "slow" call that has to query the operating system. It's best to ask for this once and
       save the results. However, this list can change, usually because the user has changed a system preference
       outside of your program; SDL will send an

       <b>SDL_EVENT_LOCALE_CHANGED</b>
        event in this case, if possible, and you can call  this  function  again  to  get  an  updated  copy  of
       preferred locales.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>count</u>  a pointer filled in with the number of locales returned, may be NULL.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       (  <b>SDL_Locale</b> <u>)</u> <u>Returns</u> <u>a</u> <u>NULL</u> <u>terminated</u> <u>array</u> <u>of</u> <u>locale</u> pointers, or NULL on failure; call <b>SDL_GetError</b>
       () for more information. This is a single allocation that should be freed with

       <b>SDL_free</b> () when it is no longer needed.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
