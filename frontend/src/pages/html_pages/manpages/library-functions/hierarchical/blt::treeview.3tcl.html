</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       treeview - Create and manipulate hierarchical table widgets
_________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>treeview</b> <u>pathName</u> ?<u>options</u>?

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>treeview</b> widget displays a <b>tree</b> of data with styles, tags, and data sharing (via <u>tree</u> <u>data</u> <u>objects</u>).

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>treeview</b>  widget  manages  a  collection of entries where each entry contains a <b>tree</b> node plus added
       style and attribute information.

       Entries are usually inserted into a treeview  with  a  label-list  to  specify  the  unique  hierarchical
       position  relative  to  <b>root</b>  (or  the  <b>-at</b>  node);  The  tail  of  this  label-list is unique within its
       hierarchical level.  If no label is given, the generated node-id is used as the label.  Labels provide  a
       convenient way to index entries using the <b>-&gt;</b> notation.  eg.

               treeview .t
               .t insert end
               .t insert end X
               .t insert end A {A a} {A b} B C
               .t insert end a b c {c i} {c ii}   -at root-&gt;B
               set id [.t index root-&gt;B-&gt;c-&gt;i]
               puts [.t get $id];        # outputs i
               puts [.t get -full $id];  # outputs {B c i}
               pack .t

</pre><h4><b>COLUMN</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       Column data can be stored within an entry using the <b>-data</b> option or <b>entry</b> sub-commands, eg.

               treeview .t
               .t column insert end X Y Z
               .t insert end A -data {X 1 Y 2}
               .t insert end B -data {X 3 Y 4 Z 5}
               .t entry conf root-&gt;B -data {X 5 Y 4 Z 3}
               .t entry set  root-&gt;A Z 3
               .t entry incr root-&gt;B Y
               pack .t

       Labels can be created with auto-generated sequence numbers using an empty string or a trailing <b>#auto</b>.

               treeview .t
               .t column insert end X
               .t insert end {}       -data {X 0};   # Label is "1"
               .t insert end #auto    -data {X 1};   # Label is "2"
               .t insert end Foo#auto -data {X 2};   # Label is "Foo1"
               pack .t

</pre><h4><b>TREE</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>OBJECT</b></h4><pre>
       Node  data in treeview is actually stored in a tree data object, which separates data storage from widget
       appearance.  The <b>-tree</b> option can be used to explictly set a  tree  (externally  created  with  the  <b>tree</b>
       command) thus giving access to trees more extensive data manipulation facilities, eg.

               set t [tree create]
               $t insert root -label A
               $t insert root-&gt;A -label B -data {X 1}
               treeview .t -tree $t
               .t column insert end X
               pack .t

       A tree can also be attached to a treeview, eg.

               set t [tree create]
               $t attach [.t cget -tree]
               set dump [$t dump root]
               tree destroy $t

       Note that when inserting data via the <b>tree</b> sub-commands, unique label checking is not performed.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>treeview</b> <u>pathName</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...  The <b>treeview</b> command creates a new window <u>pathName</u> and makes it into
       a  <b>treeview</b>  widget.   At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named <u>pathName</u>,
       but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.  Additional options may be specified on the  command  line  or  in  the
       option  database  to  configure  aspects  of  the  widget such as its colors and font.  See the <b>configure</b>
       operation below for the exact details about what <u>option</u> and <u>value</u> pairs are valid.

       If successful, <b>treeview</b> returns the path name of the widget.  It also creates a new Tcl  command  by  the
       same  name.   You can use this command to invoke various operations that query or modify the widget.  The
       operations available are described in the <b>TREEVIEW</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b> section.

       Treeview displays nodes as row entries in the widget.  Each entry has a text label and icon.  When a node
       has children, its entry is drawn with a small button to the left of the label.  Clicking the  mouse  over
       this button opens or closes the node.  When a node is <u>open</u>, its children are exposed.  When it is <u>closed</u>,
       the  children  and  their  descedants  are  hidden.   The button is normally a <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> symbol (ala Windows
       Explorer), but can be replaced with a pair of Tk images (open and closed images).

       If the node has data associated with it, they can be displayed in columns running  vertically  on  either
       side the tree.  You can control the color, font, etc of each entry.  Any entry label or data field can be
       edited in-place.

</pre><h4><b>IDS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TAGS</b></h4><pre>
       Nodes can be inserted into a tree using the <b>treeview</b> widget

                blt::treeview .t
                set node [.t insert end "one"]

       or <b>tree</b> command.

               set tree [blt::tree create]
               set node [$tree insert root -label "one"]
               blt::treeview .t -tree $tree

       In  both cases, a number identifying the node is returned (the value of <b>$node</b>).  This serial number or <u>id</u>
       uniquely identifies the node.  Please note that you can't infer a location or position of a node from its
       id.  The only exception is that the root node is always id <b>0</b>. Since nodes may have the same labels or  be
       moved  within  the  tree,  ids provide an convenient way to identify nodes.  If a tree is shared, the ids
       will be the same regardless if you are using by the  <b>treeview</b>  widget  or  the  <b>tree</b>  command.   Ids  are
       recycled only when all nodes are deleted.

       A node may also have any number of <u>tags</u> associated with it.  A tag is just a string of characters, and it
       may  take  any  form except that of an integer.  For example, "<b>x123</b>" is valid, but "<b>123</b>" isn't.  The same
       tag may be associated with many different nodes.  This is typically done to associate a group  of  nodes.
       Many operations in the <b>treeview</b> widget take either node ids or tag names as arguments.  Using a tag means
       apply the operation to all nodes with that tag.

       Commands that take a <u>tagnode</u> will also accept a list of zero or more integer node numbers (node-list).  A
       node-list  consist  of space separated integers, without leading spaces.  Node lists can simplify the use
       of iterating commands and are used widely in the <b>tree</b> command.

       There are four built-in or psuedo tags:

              <b>all</b>       Applies to every node in the tree.

              <b>nonroot</b>   Applies to every node in the tree except the root node.

              <b>rootchildren</b>
                        Applies to every node in the tree whose parent is the root node.

              <b>root</b>      Managed automatically by the tree object, <b>root</b> specifies the node that is currently  set
                        as the root node for the tree.

       Tags  are  shared  between  clients.   This  means  for example that tags created by the <b>tree</b> command are
       available in the <b>treeview</b> widget.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>NODE</b> <b>IDS</b></h4><pre>
       There are several special non-numeric ids.  Special  ids  differ  from  tags  in  that  they  are  always
       translated  to a single numeric node.  They also take precedence over tags.  For example, you can't use a
       tag name that is a special id.  These ids are specific to the <b>treeview</b> widget.

       <b>active</b>         The node where the mouse pointer is currently located.  When a node is active, it is drawn
                      using  its  active  icon  (see  the  <b>-activeicon</b>  option).   The  <b>active</b>  id  is   changed
                      automatically by moving the mouse pointer over another node or by using the <b>entry</b> <b>activate</b>
                      operation. Note that there can be only one active node at a time.

       <b>anchor</b>         The  node  representing  the fixed end of the current selection.  The anchor is set by the
                      <b>selection</b> <b>anchor</b> operation.

       <b>bottom</b>         The last viewable node.

       <b>current</b>        The node where the mouse pointer is currently located.  But unlike <b>active</b>, this id changes
                      while the selection is dragged.  It is used to determine the current  node  during  button
                      drags.

       <b>down</b>           The next open node from the current focus. The <b>down</b> of the last open node is the same.

       <b>end</b>            The last node at depth 1 in tree.

       <b>focus</b>          The  node  that  currently  has focus.  When a node has focus, it receives key events.  To
                      indicate focus, the node is drawn with a dotted line around its label.  You can change the
                      focus using the <b>focus</b> operation.

       <b>last</b>           Same as <b>tail</b>.

       <b>mark</b>           The node representing the non-fixed end of the current selection.  The mark is set by  the
                      <b>selection</b> <b>mark</b> operation.

       <b>next</b>           The  next  open  node  from the current focus.  But unlike <b>down</b>, when the focus is on last
                      open node, <b>next</b> wraps around to the root node.

       <b>nextsibling</b>    The next sibling from the node with the current focus.  If the node is  already  the  last
                      sibling then it is the <b>nextsibling</b>.

       <b>parent</b>         The parent of the node with the current focus. The <b>parent</b> of the root is also the root.

       <b>prev</b>           The  last open node from the current focus. But unlike <b>up</b>, when the focus is at root, <b>last</b>
                      wraps around to the last open node in the tree.

       <b>prevsibling</b>    The previous sibling from the node with the current focus.  If the  node  is  already  the
                      first sibling then it is the <b>prevsibling</b>.

       <b>root</b>           The root node. You can also use id <b>0</b> to indicate the root.

       <b>tail</b>           The last node in the tree, viewable or not.

       <b>top</b>            The first node.

       <b>up</b>             The  last open node (in depth-first order) from the current focus. The <b>up</b> of the root node
                      (i.e. the root has focus) is also the root.

       <b>view.top</b>       First node that's current visible in the widget.

       <b>view.bottom</b>    Last node that's current visible in the widget.

       <b>@</b><u>x</u><b>,</b><u>y</u>           Indicates the node that covers the point in the treeview window specified by <u>x</u> and  <u>y</u>  (in
                      pixel  coordinates).  If no part of the entryd covers that point, then the closest node to
                      that point is used.

       <u>ID</u><b>-&gt;</b><u>LABEL</u>-&gt;<u>LABEL</u>...
                      Lookup via node labels, eg. <u>0-&gt;Main-&gt;Users</u>.  Quotes can be used  around  labels  that  use
                      reserved words or contain spaces, eg. <u>0-&gt;"Main"-&gt;'User</u> <u>Groups'</u>.  See the <b>tree</b> man page for
                      more details.

       A  node  may  be specified as an id or tag. If the specifier is an integer then it is assumed to refer to
       the single node with that id.  If the specifier is not an integer, it's checked to see if it's a  special
       id (such as focus).  Otherwise, it's assumed to be tag.  Some operations only operate on a single node at
       a time; if a tag refers to more than one node, then an error is generated.

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       Nodes  in  treeview can manage <u>data</u> <u>fields</u> associated with columns.  Data is displayed in columns running
       on either side of the displayed tree.  Any node that doesn't have a specific field will  show  as  blank.
       Columns can (interactively) be resized, hidden, and, moved.

       Nodes  can  contain  disjoint data fields (they aren't required to set all fields).  And data manipulated
       via the <b>tree</b> command does not require an associated treeview column at all.

</pre><h4><b>ARRAY</b> <b>REFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       Like <b>tree</b>, <b>treeview</b> supports accessing data sub-fields with an <u>array</u> <u>notation</u>, eg.

               treeview .t
               .t col insert end A
               .t insert end a -data {A "x 1 y 2 z 3"}
               .t entry incr  root-&gt;a A(x)
               .t entry set   root-&gt;a A(w) 0
               .t entry unset root-&gt;a A(z)

       Only the following treeview commmands support the <u>array</u> <u>notation</u>: <b>entry</b> <b>get</b>, <b>entry</b> <b>set</b>, <b>entry</b> <b>incr</b>, <b>entry</b>
       <b>unset</b>, and <b>find</b> <b>-column</b>.  See <b>tree</b> for more complete support.

</pre><h4><b>ENTRY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       You can bind Tcl commands to be invoked when events occur on nodes (much like Tk canvas items).  You  can
       bind a node using its id or its <u>bindtags</u>.  Bindtags are simply names that associate a binding with one or
       more nodes.  There is a built-in tag <b>all</b> that all node entries automatically have.

</pre><h4><b>TREEVIEW</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>treeview</b>  operations  are  the  invoked  by specifying the widget's pathname, the operation, and any
       arguments that pertain to that operation.  The general form is:

              <u>pathName</u> <u>operation</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?

       <u>Operation</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the  exact  behavior  of  the  command.   The  following  operation  are
       available for <b>treeview</b> widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bbox</b> ?<b>-screen</b>? <u>tagOrId...</u>
              Returns  a  list  of  4  numbers, representing a bounding box of around the specified entries. The
              entries is given by one or more <u>tagOrId</u> arguments.  If the <b>-screen</b> flag is  given,  then  the  x-y
              coordinates  of  the  bounding  box  are  returned as screen coordinates, not virtual coordinates.
              Virtual coordinates start from <b>0</b> from the root node and include the title.  If the <b>-world</b> flag  is
              given,  then  the  y  coordinate  the  title  height  is added in.  The returned list contains the
              following values.

              <u>x</u>         X-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding box.

              <u>y</u>         Y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding box.

              <u>width</u>     Width of the bounding box.

              <u>height</u>    Height of the bounding box.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bind</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>sequence</u> <u>command</u>?
              Associates <u>command</u> with <u>tagName</u> such that whenever the event sequence given by <u>sequence</u> occurs for
              a node with this tag, <u>command</u> will be invoked.  The syntax is similar to the <b>bind</b>  command  except
              that it operates on <b>treeview</b> entries, rather than widgets.  The <u>tagName</u> can be an entry or tag, or
              predefined  tags  such as <b>all</b>, <b>Entry</b> or <b>Button</b>.  See the <b>bind</b> manual entry for complete details on
              <u>sequence</u> and the substitutions performed on <u>command</u> before invoking it.

              If all arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing any existing  binding  for
              the  same  <u>sequence</u>  and <u>tagName</u>.  If the first character of <u>command</u> is <b>+</b> then <u>command</u> augments an
              existing binding rather than replacing it.  If no <u>command</u> argument is provided  then  the  command
              currently  associated  with <u>tagName</u> and <u>sequence</u> (it's an error occurs if there's no such binding)
              is returned.  If both <u>command</u> and <u>sequence</u> are missing then a list of all the event sequences  for
              which bindings have been defined for <u>tagName</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>button</b> <u>operation</u> ?<u>args</u>?
              This  command  is  used  to control the button selectors within a <b>treeview</b> widget.  It has several
              forms, depending on <u>operation</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>button</b> <b>activate</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Designates the node given by <u>tagOrId</u> as active.  When a node is active it's entry is  drawn
                     using its active icon (see the <b>-activeicon</b> option).  Note that there can be only one active
                     entry at a time.  The special id <b>active</b> indicates the currently active node.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>button</b> <b>bind</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>sequence</u> <u>command</u>?
                     Associates  <u>command</u>  with  <u>tagName</u>  such that whenever the event sequence given by <u>sequence</u>
                     occurs for an button of a node entry with this tag, <u>command</u> will be invoked.  The syntax is
                     similar to the <b>bind</b> command except that  it  operates  on  <b>treeview</b>  buttons,  rather  than
                     widgets.  See  the <b>bind</b> manual entry for complete details on <u>sequence</u> and the substitutions
                     performed on <u>command</u> before invoking it.

                     If all arguments are specified then a  new  binding  is  created,  replacing  any  existing
                     binding  for  the  same  <u>sequence</u> and <u>tagName</u>.  If the first character of <u>command</u> is <b>+</b> then
                     <u>command</u> augments an existing binding rather than replacing it.  If no <u>command</u>  argument  is
                     provided  then  the  command  currently associated with <u>tagName</u> and <u>sequence</u> (it's an error
                     occurs if there's no such binding) is returned.  If both <u>command</u> and <u>sequence</u>  are  missing
                     then a list of all the event sequences for which bindings have been defined for <u>tagName</u>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>button</b> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
                     Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any
                     of the values accepted by the <b>configure</b> operation described below.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>button</b> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified,
                     returns a list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u>  (see  <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>
                     for  information  on  the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then
                     the command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical  to
                     the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more
                     <u>option-value</u>  pairs  are specified, then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to
                     have the given value(s);  in this case the command returns an  empty  string.   <u>Option</u>  and
                     <u>value</u> are described in the section <b>BUTTON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> below.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the
              values accepted by the <b>configure</b> operation described below.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>close</b> ?<b>-recurse</b>? ?<b>-trees</b>? <u>tagOrId...</u>
              Closes  the  node  specified  by  <u>tagOrId</u>.   In  addition,  if  a  Tcl script was specified by the
              <b>-closecommand</b> option, it is invoked.  If the node is already closed, this command has  no  effect.
              If  the  <b>-recurse</b> flag is present, each child node is recursively closed.  The <b>-trees</b> flag is like
              <b>-recurse</b> but operates only on nodes with children, excluding the <u>root</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <u>operation</u> ?<u>args</u>?
              The following operations are available for treeview columns.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>activate</b> <u>column</u>
                     Sets the active column to <u>column</u>.  <u>Column</u> is the name of a column in the  widget.   When  a
                     column  is  active,  it's drawn using its <b>-activetitlebackground</b> and <b>-activetitleforeground</b>
                     options.  If <u>column</u> is the <b>""</b>, then no column will be active.  If  no  column  argument  is
                     provided, then the name of the currently active column is returned.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>bbox</b> ?<b>-visible</b>? <u>column</u> <u>entry</u>
                     Returns  a  list  of 4 numbers, representing a bounding box of around the specified entries
                     cell. Giving an entry of <b>-1</b> matches the title row.  If <b>-visible</b>  is  given,  the  width  is
                     constrained to not extend past the widgets display.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>bind</b> <u>column</u> ?<u>sequence</u> <u>command</u>?
                     These  deal  with  the  title  part  of  columns.  Associates <u>command</u> with <u>column</u> such that
                     whenever the event sequence given by <u>sequence</u> occurs for a column node entry with this tag,
                     <u>command</u> will be invoked.  The syntax is similar to the <b>bind</b> command except that it operates
                     on <b>treeview</b> colunns, rather than widgets. See the <b>bind</b> manual entry for complete details on
                     <u>sequence</u> and the substitutions performed on <u>command</u> before invoking it.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>cget</b> <u>name</u> <u>option</u>
                     Returns the current value of the column configuration option  given  by  <u>option</u>  for  <u>name</u>.
                     <u>Name</u>  is  the  name of column that corresponds to a data field.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the
                     values accepted by the <b>configure</b> operation described below.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>configure</b> <u>name</u> ?<u>name</u> ...? ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u>  ...?
                     Query or modify the configuration options of one or more columns <u>name</u>. <u>Name</u> is the name  of
                     the  column  corresponding  to  a  data  field.   If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a list
                     describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for  information
                     on  the  format  of  this  list).   If  <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command
                     returns a list describing the one  named  option  (this  list  will  be  identical  to  the
                     corresponding  sublist  of  the  value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more
                     <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget  option(s)  to
                     have  the  given  value(s);   in this case the command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> and
                     <u>value</u> are described in the section <b>COLUMN</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> below.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>current</b>
                     Get column currently under the mouse.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>delete</b> <u>field</u> ?<u>field</u>...?
                     Deletes one of more columns designated by <u>field</u>.  Requests to delete the  tree  column  are
                     silently ignored.  Note that this does not delete the data fields themselves.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>index</b> <u>index</u>
                     Return the integer for index.  May use "end" or "end-N".

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>insert</b> <u>position</u> <u>field</u>  ?<u>field</u> ...? ?<u>options</u>...?
                     Inserts  one  (or  more)  columns designated by <u>field</u>.  A column displays each entry node's
                     data field using this name.  If the node doesn't define the given field, the cell  is  left
                     blank.   <u>Position</u>  indicates where in the list of columns to add the new column.  It may be
                     either a name, a number or <b>end</b>.  If multiple column <u>fields</u> are given, only  the  first  can
                     start  with a dash.  If <u>field</u> is the empty string or <b>#auto</b>, a name is generated prefixed by
                     the string <b>Col</b> and a unique integer.  If <u>field</u> ends with <b>#auto</b>,  the  generated  name  uses
                     it's  prefix instead.  The returned values is the created column names.  Note that the tree
                     column <u>#0</u> is predefined and can not be deleted.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>invoke</b> <u>field</u>
                     Invokes the Tcl command associated with the column  <u>field</u>,  if  there  is  one  (using  the
                     column's  <b>-command</b>  option).   The  command is ignored if the column's <b>-state</b> option set to
                     <b>disabled</b>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>isset</b> <b>?</b><u>startOrTag</u>? ?<u>end</u>?
                     Returns list of data columns for elements in range actually having data values set in them.
                     One possible use for this might be hiding columns which  are  empty.   With  no  arguments,
                     checks  only entries on the visible screen.  With one argument, checks all entries matching
                     a tag or id.  With two arguments, checks all entries between start and end range.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>istree</b> <u>field</u>
                     Return 1 if column is the tree column.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>move</b> <u>name</u> <u>dest</u>
                     Moves the column <u>name</u> to the destination position.  <u>Dest</u> is the  offset,  name  of  another
                     column or a screen position in the form <b>@</b><u>x</u><b>,</b><u>y</u>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>names</b> <b>?</b><u>-visible</u>? ?<u>PATTERN</u>?
                     Returns  a  list  of  the  names  of all columns in the widget.  The list is ordered as the
                     columns are drawn from left-to-right.  If -visible, then display only columns  where  -hide
                     is 0.  A pattern may be specified to limit results.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>nearest</b> <u>x</u> ?<u>y</u>?
                     Returns  the name of the column closest to the given X-Y screen coordinate.  If you provide
                     a <u>y</u> argument (it's optional), a name is returned only when if the point is over a  column's
                     title.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>offsets</b>
                     Returns the starting offsets for each column.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>resize</b> <b>op</b> <b>...</b>
                     Operations for resize where op is one of activate, anchor, mark or set.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>see</b> ?<b>-anchor</b> <u>anchor</u>? <u>field</u>
                     Adjusts  the  view  so that the column given by <u>field</u> is visible in the widget window.  The
                     node's position on the screen can be set using the <b>-anchor</b> flag.  Its value is a Tk  anchor
                     position: <b>w,</b> <b>c,</b> <b>e</b>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>values</b> ?<b>-visible</b>? ?<b>-default</b> <b>value</b>? <u>field</u> ?<u>start</u>? ?<u>end</u>?
                     Returns a list of data values for a column.  The -visible flag excludes the values that are
                     hidden  or  inside closed subtrees.  The root nodes does not get included when <u>-hideroot</u> is
                     true.  The -default option specifies a value to substitute for unset data column cells.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u>  is  specified,  returns  a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on
              the  format  of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list
              describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist  of  the
              value  returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then
              the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given  value(s);   in  this  case  the
              command  returns  an empty string.  <u>Option</u> and <u>value</u> are described in the section <b>TREEVIEW</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
              below.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>curselection</b>
              Returns a list containing the ids of all of the entries that are currently selected.  If there are
              no entries selected, then the empty string is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <u>tagnode</u>...
              Deletes one or more entries given by <u>tagnode</u> and its children.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>edit</b> <b>?-test</b>? ?<b>-root</b>? ?<b>-noscroll</b>? ?<b>-scroll</b>? ?<u>X</u> <u>Y</u>?
              Handle cell editing.  The x,y coordinates are usually  required,  except  when  using  the  scroll
              options.

              <b>-noscroll</b> Disable scrolling.  Useful when displaying an edit subwindow.

              <b>-scroll</b>   Re-enable scrolling.  Usually bound to a destroy event of an edit subwindow.

              <b>-root</b>     Use root coordinates.

              <b>-test</b>     Test if edit is complete.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <u>operation</u> ?<u>args</u>?
              The following operations are available for treeview entries.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>activate</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Sets the active entry to the one specified by <u>tagOrId</u>.  When an entry is active it is drawn
                     using its active icon (see the <b>-activeicon</b> and <b>-activeleaficon</b> options).  The special id of
                     the currently active node is <b>active</b>.  Note that there can be only one active node at a time
                     and  currently  icons  must be the same size/shape as the backgrounds are not cleared.  But
                     <b>bind</b> can be used to overcome these limitations.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
                     Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any
                     of the values accepted by the <b>configure</b> operation described below.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>children</b> <u>tagOrId</u>  ?<u>first</u>? ?<u>last</u>?
                     Returns a list of ids for the given range of children of <u>tagOrId</u>.  <u>TagOrId</u> is the id or tag
                     of the node to be examined.  If only a <u>first</u> argument is present, then the id of  the  that
                     child  at  that  numeric position is returned.  If both <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> arguments are given,
                     then the ids of all the children in that range are returned.   Otherwise  the  ids  of  all
                     children are returned.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>configure</b> <u>tagnode</u> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified,
                     returns a list describing all of the available options for  <u>tagnode</u>  (see  <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>
                     for  information  on  the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then
                     the command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical  to
                     the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more
                     <u>option-value</u>  pairs  are specified, then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to
                     have the given value(s);  in this case the command returns an  empty  string.   <u>Option</u>  and
                     <u>value</u> are described below:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>delete</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
                     Deletes  the one or more children nodes of the parent <u>tagOrId</u>.  If <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> arguments
                     are present, they are positions designating a range of children nodes to be deleted.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>depth</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Return tree depth of node where root is 0.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>down</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     The next open node from the given node. The <b>down</b> of the last open node is the same.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>exists</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Return 1 if entry exists.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>get</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>key</u>? ?<u>default</u>?
                     Return a key-field value for an entry.  When no <u>key</u> is given, returns  the  values  of  all
                     visible  columns.   If  the  given <u>key</u> is undefined, return <u>default</u> if given, else throw an
                     error.  Unlike <b>entry</b> <b>set</b>, the tree is accessed  directly  so  keys  not  having  associated
                     columns are supported.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>incr</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>key</u> ?<u>amount</u>?
                     Increment  value  by  1  or given <u>amount</u> and return the value.  The incr operation normally
                     tries to use integers, but uses doubles when one of value or <u>amount</u> is a double.  An  array
                     reference may also be used.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>isbefore</b> <u>tagOrId1</u> <u>tagOrId2</u>
                     Returns 1 if <u>tagOrId1</u> is before <u>tagOrId2</u> and 0 otherwise.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>ishidden</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Returns 1 if the node is currently hidden and 0 otherwise.  A node is also hidden if any of
                     its ancestor nodes are closed or hidden.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>isleaf</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Returns 1 if the node is a leaf node.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>isopen</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Returns 1 if the node is currently open.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>isset</b>  <u>tagOrId</u> <u>col</u>
                     Return true if the entry sets a column-field (has a value).  The entry and column both must
                     exist.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>isvisible</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Returns 1 if node is not hidden, inside a closed subtree.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>next</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     The  next  open  node from the given node.  But unlike <b>down</b>, when the focus is on last open
                     node, <b>next</b> wraps around to the root node.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>parent</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Returns parent of the given node.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>prev</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     The last open node from the given node. But unlike <b>up</b>, when the  focus  is  at  root,  <b>last</b>
                     wraps around to the last open node in the tree.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>relabel</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>newLabel</u>
                     Change  the  tree  node label associated with an entry.  This sets the tree node <u>label</u>; ie.
                     the value returned by the <b>get</b> command.  Note this is not the same  thing  as  the  treeview
                     entries  <b>-label</b>  option.   Also,  the  <b>-allowduplicates</b>  option must be enabled to use this
                     command as no duplicate checking will be performed.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>select</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Make the given node visible and give it the focus.  When in single  selectmode,  select  it
                     (calls <u>::blt::tv::MoveFocus</u>)

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>set</b>  <u>tagOrId</u> <u>col</u> ?<u>value</u> <u>col</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Get or set column-fields for an entry.  Provides a simple way to read or update fields from
                     the <u>-data</u> option of an entry.  An array reference may also be used.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>sibling</b> <b>?-before</b>? <u>tagOrId</u>
                     The  next/previous  sibling  from  the  given  node.  If the node is already the last/first
                     sibling then nothing is returned.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>size</b> <b>-recurse</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Returns the number of children for parent node <u>tagOrId</u>.  If the <b>-recurse</b> flag is  set,  the
                     number of all its descendants is returned.  The node itself is not counted.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>unset</b>  <u>tagOrId</u> <u>col</u>
                     Unset a column-field for an entry.  An array reference may also be used.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>up</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     The  last  open node (in depth-first order) from the given node. The <b>up</b> of the last node is
                     itself.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>value</b>  <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>col</u>?
                     Return the value for an entry column, or all visible columns  if  <u>col</u>  not  given.   Unlike
                     <b>entry</b> <b>set</b>, this gives access to the formatted value from <b>-formatcmd</b> (if there was one).

       <u>pathName</u> <b>find</b> ?<u>flags</u>? <u>first</u> <u>last</u>
              Finds  for all entries matching the criteria given by <u>flags</u>.  A list of ids for all matching nodes
              is returned. <u>First</u> and <u>last</u> are ids designating the range of the search in depth-first  order.  If
              <u>last</u> is before <u>first</u>, then nodes are searched in reverse order.  The valid flags are:

              <b>-addtag</b> <b>NAME</b>
                        Add tag to each matching entry.  The tag will be created even if no nodes are tagged.

              <b>-cmdargs</b> <u>columns</u>
                        Specify columns whose values are to be appended to <b>-command</b>.

              <b>-command</b> <u>command</u>
                        Invoke <u>command</u> for each matching node.  Before <u>command</u> is invoked, the id of the node is
                        appended. If <u>command</u> generates an error, processing stops and the <b>find</b> operation returns
                        an  error.   If  <u>command</u> returns <b>return</b>, then the returned integer is used to indicate 1
                        for match or 0 for mismatch.

              <b>-column</b> <u>col</u>
                        Match name against value of given column.  An array reference may also  be  used.   This
                        option must be used in conjunction with <u>-name</u> and may not be used with <u>-usepath</u>.

              <b>-count</b>    Just return the number of matches.

              <b>-depth</b> <u>number</u>
                        Entry must be at depth <u>number</u>.

              <b>-exact</b>    Patterns must match exactly.  The is the default.

              <b>-exec</b> <u>string</u>
                        Specifies  a  Tcl  script  to  be  evaluated  for  each matching node.  If <b>-var</b> was also
                        specified, that variable is set with the value of the node id  before  each  evaluation.
                        Otherwise,  percent  sustitutions  are  performed: note this is much less efficient than
                        using either <b>-var</b> or <b>-command</b>

                        The result of each eval gets appended to the return list, unless  the  script  issues  a
                        CONTINUE, in which case that node is skipped.

                        The available percent substitutions on <u>string</u> are:

                        <b>%#</b>   The id of the node.

                        <b>%W</b>   The pathname of the widget.

                        <b>%p</b>   The name of the node.

                        <b>%P</b>   The full pathname of the node.

                        <b>%V</b>   The current value (the node name, node label or column value).

                        <b>%F</b>   Like <b>%V</b>, but returns the on-screen value (from -formatcmd).

                        <b>%C</b>   The current column.

                        <b>%%</b>   Translates to a single percent.

              <b>-glob</b>     Use  global  pattern  matching.   Matching  is done in a fashion similar to that used by
                        <b>string</b> <b>match</b>.

              <b>-invert</b>   Invert the meaning of the pattern match for <b>-name</b>.

              <b>-isclosed</b> Include only entries that are closed.

              <b>-isempty</b>  Only match nodes where the specified <b>-column</b> key value was unset.

              <b>-ishidden</b> Include only entries that are hidden, either because the entry has set -hide, or is  has
                        style that is hidden.  The root node is not included.

              <b>-isleaf</b>   Entry must not have child nodes.

              <b>-ismapped</b> Include only entries that are currently all or partly drawn on screen.  The root node is
                        not included.

              <b>-isopen</b>   Include only entries that are opened.

              <b>-istree</b>   Entry must have child nodes.

              <b>-limit</b> <u>number</u>
                        Stop searching after <u>number</u> matches.

              <b>-maxdepth</b> Entry must be at depth or lower.

              <b>-mindepth</b> Entry must be at depth or higher.

              <b>-name</b> <u>pattern</u>
                        Specifies pattern to match against node names.

              <b>-nocase</b>   Comparisison  is ignores case.  For -regexp, the target string gets lower cased (but not
                        the pattern).

              <b>-notop</b>    Exclude the <b>-top</b> or starting node.

              <b>-regexp</b>   Use regular expression pattern matching (i.e. the same  as  implemented  by  the  <b>regexp</b>
                        command).

              <b>-reldepth</b> Change the meaning of <b>-depth</b>, <b>-mindepth</b> and <b>-maxdepth</b> to be relative to the <b>-top</b> node.

              <b>-return</b> <u>col</u>
                        Instead  of  the  node  id,  return data value of named column.  If <u>col</u> starts with a %,
                        performs percent substitution as per <b>-command</b>.  Note that a percent substitution  longer
                        than 2 chars will append values as list elements.

              <b>-top</b> <u>node</u> Search is only at <u>node</u> and it's descendants.  The default is the root node.

              <b>-useformat</b>
                        Compare pattern using <b>-formatcmd</b> value (if there is one) instead key data value.

              <b>-uselabel</b> Compare pattern using label (if there is one) instead last component of path.

              <b>-usepath</b>  Compare pattern using the full path name.

              <b>-userow</b>   Compare  pattern  using  the node value plus the values of all keys in the row.  If used
                        with <b>-visible</b>, only the visible column keys are used.

              <b>-visible</b>  Exclude values that are hidden or inside closed subtrees.  eg. The root node is excluded
                        if <u>-hideroot</u> is true.

              <b>-withouttag</b> <b>NAME</b>
                        Match entries without tag.

              <b>-withtag</b> <b>NAME</b>
                        Match entries with tag.

              <b>-var</b> <u>variable</u>
                        A variable to set with the node id before each iteration of the <b>-exec</b> script.

              <b>-option</b> <u>name</u> <u>value</u>
                        Specifies an option name and value to  match  against  the  node  entry's  configuration
                        option.

              <b>--</b>        Indicates the end of flags.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>focus</b> ?<u>tagOrId</u>?
              Get or set the focus to the node given by <u>tagOrId</u>.  When a node has focus, it can receive keyboard
              events.  The special id <b>focus</b> designates the node that currently has focus.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>get</b> ?<b>-full</b>? ?<b>-labels</b>? <u>tagnode</u> <u>tagnode</u>...
              Translates  one or more ids to their node entry names.  It returns a list of names for all the ids
              specified.  If the <b>-full</b> flag is set, then the full pathnames are returned.  If the  <b>-labels</b>  flag
              is set, then the full pathnames using labels are returned.

              Note:  Except  when a called with a single node id (ie. an integer), the result will be a list (or
              list of lists when -separator isn't set).

       <u>pathName</u> <b>hide</b> ?<b>flags</b>? <u>tagOrId</u>...
              Hides all nodes matching the criteria given by <u>flags</u>.  If no <u>tagOrId</u> are given,  traverses  entire
              tree.  The valid flags are described below:

              <b>-column</b> <u>col</u>
                        Match  name  against  value  of  given  column.  Must be used with <u>-name</u> and can not use
                        <u>-usepath</u>.

              <b>-depth</b> <u>number</u>
                        Entry must be at depth <u>number</u>.

              <b>-exact</b>    Match patterns exactly.  The is the default.

              <b>-glob</b>     Use global pattern matching.  Matching is done in a fashion  similar  to  that  used  by
                        <b>string</b> <b>match</b>.

              <b>-invert</b>   Invert the meaning of the pattern match for <b>-name</b> or <b>-option</b>.

              <b>-maxdepth</b> Entry must be at depth or lower.

              <b>-mindepth</b> Entry must be at depth or higher.

              <b>-name</b> <u>pattern</u>
                        Specifies pattern to match against node names.

              <b>-nocase</b>   Ignore case in match.

              <b>-option</b> <b>name</b> <b>value</b>
                        Specifies  an  option  name  and  value  to match against the node entry's configuration
                        option.

              <b>-regexp</b>   Use regular expression pattern matching (i.e. the same  as  implemented  by  the  <b>regexp</b>
                        command).

              <b>-uselabel</b> Specifies that the -name pattern is to match the label.

              <b>-usepath</b>  Specifies that the -name pattern is to match the full path.

              <b>-withouttag</b> <b>NAME</b>
                        Match entries with tag.

              <b>-withtag</b> <b>NAME</b>
                        Match entries with tag.

              <b>--</b>        Indicates the end of flags.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>index</b> ?<b>-at</b> <u>tagOrId</u>? ?<b>-path</b>? ?<b>-quiet</b>? <u>string</u>
              Returns the id of the node specified by <u>string</u>.  <u>String</u> may be a tag or node id.  Some special ids
              are  normally  relative  to the node that has focus but the <b>-at</b> option can be used to change this.
              The <b>-path</b> flag does a lookup using <u>String</u> as a path relative the tree root (unless the <b>-at</b>  option
              is given).  The the <b>-quiet</b> flag is given, lookup failures quietly return the empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <u>position</u> ?<u>path</u>? ?<u>path</u>? ... ?<u>options...</u>?
              Inserts one or more nodes at child <u>position</u> (a number or <b>end</b>) in the parent node.  The parent node
              is  either <b>root</b> or the value given by <b>-at</b>.  The returned value is list of ids for the new entries.
              Only the first <u>path</u> may start with a dash.

              <u>Path</u> is the pathname of the new node.  By default, pathnames are a Tcl list  (each  element  is  a
              path  component) however the <b>-separator</b> option can be used to change this.  Pathnames are normally
              relative to the root, but the <b>-at</b> switch lets you select a different  parent  node.   If  <u>path</u>  is
              ommitted,  it defaults to <u>#auto</u>.  A <u>path</u> name of <u>#auto</u> will generate a name.  This attempts to use
              the tree node name as the <u>path</u> name.

              If the last component of a <u>path</u> name ends in <u>#auto</u>, the path is generated using the string  prefix
              (before  #auto) followed by a sequential number unique within the parent, eg. <b>.t</b> <b>insert</b> <b>end</b> <b>{users</b>
              <b>u#auto}</b>.

              Note that all ancestors of the new node must already exist, unless the <b>-autocreate</b> option is  set.
              It is also an error if a node already exists, unless the <b>-allowduplicates</b> option is set.

              For  large  flat  trees  setting  <b>-allowduplicates</b> to true can greatly speedup loading #auto as it
              avoids checking overhead.  This is the fastest way to bulk load large numbers of  nodes  (next  to
              using <b>-tree</b>).

              The  <u>option</u>  arguments  may  be  any of the values accepted by <b>entry</b> <b>configure</b> as described in the
              <b>ENTRY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> section below, or any unabbreviated <b>insert-option</b>.  Note that for multi-node inserts
              <b>insert-options</b> will apply to all following nodes, and only the first <u>path</u> can start with a dash.

              The valid <b>insert-options</b> are:

              <b>-at</b> <u>nodeid</u>
                      Specify the parent node to insert entries into.  The default is <b>root</b>.

              <b>-node</b> <u>num</u>
                      The <b>-node</b> switch lets you specify a tree node number id directly  instead  of  having  one
                      generating automatically.  For multi-node inserts, the node number gets incremented.

              <b>-styles</b> <u>list</u>
                      The  <b>-styles</b> switch specifies a list of column/stylename pairs to set for entries having a
                      <b>-data</b> option.

              <b>-tags</b> <u>list</u>
                      The <b>-tags</b> switch specifies a list of tags to add to the new entries.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>move</b> <u>tagnode</u> <u>how</u> <u>destId</u>
              Moves the node(s) given by <u>tagnode</u> to the destination node.  The node can not be  an  ancestor  of
              the  destination.   <u>DestId</u>  is the id of the destination node and can not be the root of the tree.
              In conjunction with <u>how</u>, it describes how the move is performed.

              <b>before</b>  Moves the node before the destination node.

              <b>after</b>   Moves the node after the destination node.

              <b>into</b>    Moves the node to the end of the destination's list of children.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>nearest</b>  ?<b>-root</b>?  ?<b>-strict</b>? <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>varName</u>?
              Returns the id of the node entry closest to the given X-Y screen coordinate.  If the coordinate is
              not directly over any node, then the nearest  node  is  returned.   If  the  argument  <u>varName</u>  is
              present,  this  is  a  Tcl  variable that is set to either <b>button</b>, <b>icon</b>, <b>label</b>, <b>title</b>, <b>titlelabel</b>,
              <b>titleicon</b>, <b>datalabel</b>, <b>dataicon</b>, or <b>""</b> depending what part of the entry the coordinate  lies.   The
              -root  option subtracts the windows root from the coordinates.  The -strict option fails the match
              if not directly over a node, eg. in the title or past end of last row.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>open</b> ?<b>-recurse</b>? ?<b>-parent</b>? ?<b>-trees</b>? <u>tagnode...</u>
              Opens the one or more nodes specified by <u>tagnode</u>.  If a node is not already open, the  Tcl  script
              specified  by  the  <b>-opencommand</b>  option  is  invoked.  If the <b>-recurse</b> flag is present, then each
              descendant is recursively opened.  The <b>-trees</b> flag is like <b>-recurse</b> but  operates  only  on  nodes
              with children.  The <b>-parent</b> flag ensures visibility by opening all parent nodes.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>range</b> ?<b>-open</b>? <u>first</u> <u>last</u>
              Returns  the  ids  in depth-first order of the nodes between the <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> ids.  If the <b>-open</b>
              flag is present, it indicates to consider only open nodes.  If <u>last</u> is before <u>first</u>, then the  ids
              are returned in reverse order.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <u>option</u> <u>args</u>
              This command implements scanning.  It has two forms, depending on <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
                     Records  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>  and  the current view in the treeview window;  used in conjunction with
                     later <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> commands.  Typically this command is associated with a mouse button press
                     in the widget.  It returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>.
                     Computes the difference between its <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments and the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments to the last
                     <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> command for the widget.  It then adjusts the view by 10 times the  difference  in
                     coordinates.   This command is typically associated with mouse motion events in the widget,
                     to produce the effect of dragging the list at high speed through the  window.   The  return
                     value is an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>see</b> ?<b>-anchor</b> <u>anchor</u>? <u>tagOrId</u>
              Adjusts the view of entries so that the node given by <u>tagOrId</u> is visible in the widget window.  It
              is  an  error  if  <b>tagOrId</b> is a tag that refers to more than one node.  The node's position on the
              screen can be set using the <b>-anchor</b> flag.  Its value is <b>w</b>, but can be any one  of  the  Tk  anchor
              positions.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u>
              This  command  is  used  to  adjust the selection within a <b>treeview</b> widget.  It has several forms,
              depending on <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>anchor</b> <b>?</b><u>tagOrId</u>? ?<u>column</u>?
                     Sets the selection anchor to the node given by  <u>tagOrId</u>.   If  <u>tagOrId</u>  refers  to  a  non-
                     existent  node,  then  the  closest  node  is used.  The selection anchor is the end of the
                     selection that is fixed while dragging out a selection with  the  mouse.   The  special  id
                     <b>anchor</b>  may  be  used to refer to the anchor node.  With no arguments, returns anchor entry
                     and column if any.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>cells</b>
                     Returns pairs of nodes and columns for all selected cells.  The -selectmode must be <u>cell</u> or
                     <u>multicell</u>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>clear</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>? ?<u>column</u>?
                     Removes the entries between <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> (inclusive) from the selection.  Both <u>first</u>  and
                     <u>last</u>  are  ids  representing  a  range of entries.  If <u>last</u> isn't given, then only <u>first</u> is
                     deselected.  Entries outside the selection are not affected.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>clearall</b>
                     Clears the entire selection.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>mark</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>column</u>?
                     Sets the selection mark to the node given by <u>tagOrId</u>.  This causes  the  range  of  entries
                     between  the  anchor  and the mark to be temporarily added to the selection.  The selection
                     mark is the end of the selection that is fixed while dragging  out  a  selection  with  the
                     mouse.   The  special  id  <b>mark</b>  may be used to refer to the current mark node.  If <u>tagOrId</u>
                     refers to a non-existent node, then the mark is ignored.  Resetting the mark will  unselect
                     the previous range.  Setting the anchor finalizes the range.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>includes</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>column</u>?
                     Returns 1 if the node given by <u>tagOrId</u> is currently selected, 0 if it isn't.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>present</b>
                     Returns 1 if any nodes are currently selected and 0 otherwise.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>set</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>? ?<u>column</u>?
                     Selects  all of the nodes in the range between <u>first</u> and <u>last</u>, inclusive, without affecting
                     the selection state of nodes outside that range.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>toggle</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>? ?<u>column</u>?
                     Selects/deselects nodes in the range between <u>first</u> and <u>last</u>, inclusive, from the selection.
                     If a node is currently selected, it becomes deselected, and visa versa.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>show</b> ?<b>flags</b>? <u>tagOrId</u>...
              Un-hide nodes matching the criteria given by <u>flags</u>.  If no <u>tagOrId</u>  are  given,  traverses  entire
              tree.  The <u>flags</u> are the same as for the <b>hide</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>sort</b> ?<u>operation</u>? <u>args...</u>

              <u>pathName</u> <b>sort</b> <b>auto</b> ?<u>boolean</u>
                     Turns  on/off  automatic  sorting  of  node  entries.   If <u>boolean</u> is true, entries will be
                     automatically sorted as they are opened, closed,  inserted,  or  deleted.   If  no  <u>boolean</u>
                     argument is provided, the current state is returned.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>sort</b> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
                     Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any
                     of the values accepted by the <b>configure</b> operation described below.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>sort</b> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Query  or  modify  the  sorting  configuration  options  of  the  widget.   If no <u>option</u> is
                     specified, returns a list describing  all  of  the  available  options  for  <u>pathName</u>  (see
                     <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>  for information on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with
                     no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list describing the one named option (this  list  will
                     be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).
                     If  one  or  more  <u>option-value</u>  pairs  are  specified, then the command modifies the given
                     sorting option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the command  returns  an  empty
                     string.  <u>Option</u> and <u>value</u> are described below:

                     <b>-column</b> <u>string</u>
                            Specifies the column to sort. Entries in the widget are rearranged according to this
                            column.  If <u>column</u> is <b>""</b> then no sort is performed.

                     <b>-command</b> <u>string</u>
                            Specifies  a Tcl procedure to be called when sorting nodes.  The procedure is called
                            with 6 arguments: the pathname of the widget, the node id of two entries, the column
                            key being sorted and the label values of the two entries.  The procedure  returns  1
                            if  the first node is greater than the second, -1 is the second is greater, and 0 if
                            equal.

                     <b>-decreasing</b> <u>boolean</u>
                            Indicates to sort in ascending/descending order.   If  <u>boolean</u>  is  true,  then  the
                            entries as in descending order. The default is <b>no</b>.

                     <b>-mode</b> <u>string</u>
                            Specifies how to compare entries when sorting. <u>String</u> may be one of the following:

                     <b>-setflat</b> <u>bool</u>
                            Used by SortColumn to remember if tree was forced to flat by a sort.

                            <b>ascii</b>          Use string comparison based upon the ASCII collation order.

                            <b>dictionary</b>     Use  dictionary-style  comparison.   This is the same as <b>ascii</b> except
                                           (a) case is ignored except as a tie-breaker and (b)  if  two  strings
                                           contain  embedded  numbers,  the  numbers  compare  as  integers, not
                                           characters.   For  example,  "bigBoy"  sorts  between  "bigbang"  and
                                           "bigboy", and "x10y" sorts between "x9y" and "x11y".

                            <b>integer</b>        Compares fields as integers.

                            <b>real</b>           Compares fields as floating point numbers.

                            <b>command</b>        Use  the Tcl proc specified by the <b>-command</b> option to compare entries
                                           when sorting.   If no command  is  specified,  the  sort  reverts  to
                                           <b>dictionary</b> sorting.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>sort</b> <b>once</b> ?<u>flags</u>? <u>tagOrId...</u>
                     Sorts  the  children for each entries specified by <u>tagOrId</u>.  By default, entries are sorted
                     by name, but you can specify a Tcl proc to do your own comparisons.

                     <b>-recurse</b>       Recursively sort the entire branch, not just the children.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>style</b> <u>operation</u> ?<u>args</u>?
              Styles control how data is to be rendered by  the  widget.   They  are  created  with  the  <b>create</b>
              subcommands  (described below) A default style name <b>text</b> is builtin.  It is of type <u>textbox</u> and is
              used as the default style for columns.  Styles may also be applied to entries, individual cells or
              widget options.  For example, the <b>-altstyle</b> option applies a style to  every  second  visible  row
              entry while the <b>-levelstyles</b> option can specify a different style for each node level.

              The following operations are available for treeview styles.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>style</b> <b>activate</b> ?<u>entry</u>? ?<u>column</u>?
                     Get or sets a particular cell as state to active.  With two arguments sets the current cell
                     to active. With no arguments returns the active cell.   With one argument whose entry is 0,
                     sets no cell to active.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>style</b> <b>cget</b> <u>stylename</u> <u>option</u>
                     Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any
                     of the values accepted by the <b>configure</b> operation described below.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>style</b> <b>configure</b> ?<u>stylename</u> <u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified,
                     returns a list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u>  (see  <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>
                     for  information  on  the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then
                     the command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical  to
                     the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more
                     <u>option-value</u>  pairs  are specified, then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to
                     have the given value(s);  in this case the command returns an  empty  string.   <u>Option</u>  and
                     <u>value</u> are described below:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>style</b> <b>create</b> <u>...</u>?
                     Create  a  named  style.   For  a full list of style options, see the section <u>STYLE</u> <u>OPTIONS</u>

              <u>pathName</u> <b>style</b> <b>find</b> <u>stylename</u> <u>?column?</u> <u>?node?</u> <u>...</u>
                     Get all entries with the given style for a given column in the given nodes.  When no column
                     is given, looks in entry and data columns.  Duplicates are not eliminated.  cell.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>style</b> <b>forget</b> <u>stylename</u> <u>...</u>
                     Eliminates one or more style names whose reference count have reached zero (i.e. nothing is
                     using it).  Requests to delete styles that are still in use are quietly ignored.  Note that
                     the reference count of style <b>text</b> is always greater than zero.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>style</b> <b>get</b> <u>column</u> <u>tagorid</u>
                     Return the style(s) for column and nodes.  cell.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>style</b> <b>set</b> <u>stylename</u> <u>column</u> <u>node</u> <u>...</u>
                     Sets  a  style  for  a given column for all the ids given.  If column is the tree, sets the
                     entry style, otherwise sets the style in the data column, thus  setting  the  style  for  a
                     single  cell in an entry.  The style name may be an empty string to unset the style.  Cells
                     that do not have a value may not have a style set and so are silently ignored.  The  number
                     of cells that actually get set with a style is returned.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>style</b> <b>slaves</b> ?<b>-col</b> <u>col</u>? ?<b>-id</b> <u>node</u>? ?<b>-style</b> <u>styleName</u>? ?<b>-visible</b> <u>bool</u>? ?<b>-info</b> <u>path</u>?

                     in the given column.  The <u>-id</u> argument shows only windows for the given entry.  The  <u>-style</u>
                     argument shows only windows with the given style.  The <u>-visible</u> argument shows only windows
                     that  are  visible  or  invisible.   The  <u>-info</u> argument dumps all information for a single
                     window.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>style</b> <b>type</b> ?<u>name</u>? ?<u>newtype</u>?
                     With no arguments, return list of all available styles.   With  one  argument,  return  the
                     style  type  of  <u>name</u>.   With  two arguments, change the style type of <u>name</u> to <u>newtype</u>, and
                     reset all style options back to the defaults.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>style</b> <b>use</b> <u>stylename</u>
                     Return the use count for a style.  Note: in order to remove a style with <b>style</b> <b>forget</b>, this
                     count must be <b>0</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <u>operation</u> <u>args</u>
              Tags are a general means of selecting and marking nodes in the tree.  A tag is just  a  string  of
              characters,  and  it  may take any form except that of an integer.  The same tag may be associated
              with many different nodes.

              Both <u>operation</u> and its arguments determine the exact behavior  of  the  command.   The  operations
              available for tags are listed below.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>add</b> <u>string</u> ?<u>id</u>...?
                     Adds the tag <u>string</u> to one of more entries.  If no nodes are given, just creates the tag.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>delete</b> <u>string</u> <u>tagnode</u>...
                     Deletes the tag <u>string</u> from one or more entries.

              <u>treeName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>exists</b> <u>string</u> ?<u>id</u>?
                     If an <u>id</u> is given, return 1 (or 0)  if entry has (or hasn't) the tag.  Otherwise, returns 1
                     if at least one entry has tag <u>string</u>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>forget</b> <u>string</u>
                     Removes  the  tag  <u>string</u>  from all entries.  It's not an error if no entries are tagged as
                     <u>string</u>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>names</b> ?<u>id</u>?
                     Returns a list of tags used.  If an <u>id</u> argument is present, only those  tags  used  by  the
                     node designated by <u>id</u> are returned.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>nodes</b>  <u>name</u> ?<u>name</u> ...?
                     Returns  a  list of ids that have any of the <u>name</u> tags.  If no node is tagged as <u>name</u>, then
                     an empty list is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>toggle</b> <u>tagnode</u>
              Opens or closes the node given by <u>tagOrId</u>.  If the  corresponding  <b>-opencommand</b>  or  <b>-closecommand</b>
              option is set, then that command is also invoked.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <u>args</u>
              This  command  is  used  to  query  and  change  the horizontal position of the information in the
              widget's window.  It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b>
                     Returns a list containing two elements.  Each element is a real fraction between 0  and  1;
                     together  they describe the horizontal span that is visible in the window.  For example, if
                     the first element is .2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the <b>treeview</b> widget's text  is
                     off-screen  to  the  left,  the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the text is
                     off-screen to the  right.   These  are  the  same  values  passed  to  scrollbars  via  the
                     <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the character position given by <u>tagOrId</u> is displayed
                     at  the  left  edge  of  the  window.   Character positions are defined by the width of the
                     character <b>0</b>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the total width of the <b>treeview</b> widget's
                     text is off-screen to the left.  <u>fraction</u> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This command shifts the view in the window left or right  according  to  <u>number</u>  and  <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u> must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or an abbreviation of one of
                     these.   If  <u>what</u>  is  <b>units</b>, the view adjusts left or right by <u>number</u> character units (the
                     width of the <b>0</b> character) on the display;  if it is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts  by  <u>number</u>
                     screenfuls.   If <u>number</u> is negative then characters farther to the left become visible;  if
                     it is positive then characters farther to the right become visible.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <u>?args</u>?
              This command is used to query and change the vertical position of the text in the widget's window.
              It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b>
                     Returns a list containing two elements, both of which are real fractions between 0  and  1.
                     The  first element gives the position of the node at the top of the window, relative to the
                     widget as a whole (0.5 means it is halfway through the treeview window, for example).   The
                     second  element  gives  the  position  of  the  node just after the last one in the window,
                     relative to the widget as a whole.  These are the same values passed to scrollbars via  the
                     <b>-yscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the node given by <u>tagOrId</u> is displayed at the top of
                     the window.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the node given by <u>fraction</u> appears at the top of the
                     window.   <u>Fraction</u>  is  a  fraction  between  0  and  1;   0 indicates the first node, 0.33
                     indicates the node one-third the way through the <b>treeview</b> widget, and so on.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This command adjusts the view in the window up  or  down  according  to  <u>number</u>  and  <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u> must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b>.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view
                     adjusts  up  or  down  by  <u>number</u>  lines;   if  it is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by <u>number</u>
                     screenfuls.  If <u>number</u> is negative then earlier nodes become visible;  if  it  is  positive
                     then later nodes become visible.

</pre><h4><b>TREEVIEW</b> <b>EDITING</b></h4><pre>
       A  column of data is editable when  its <b>-edit</b> option is set to True For column 0, edit changes an entries
       <u>-label</u> option.  For all other columns, edit will update the <u>-data</u> fields.  Tree data traces can  also  be
       used  for edit control.  Most of the following applies to textbox styles.  However, combobox and checkbox
       also generate &lt;&lt;TreeViewEditStart/End&gt;&gt; events while barbox and windowbox are not editable.

       Text editing is aborted with &lt;Escape&gt; and finished with &lt;Return&gt;.  A  newline  may  be  inserted  with  a
       &lt;Control-r&gt;.   Native Tk widgets are now used for builtin editing, using the path <b>$w.edit</b>.  By default an
       <b>entry</b> widget  will  be  used,   however,  column  editing  options  can  be  changed  via  <b>-editopts</b>  and
       <b>-validatecmd</b>.  Moreover,  columns  with  a  combobox style can provide popup list of options in a listbox
       using the following style options: <b>-choices,</b> <b>-choicecmd,</b> <b>-choicekey,</b> <b>-choiceicons</b> Two virtual events  can
       be used to gain control the during edit: <u>&lt;&lt;TreeViewEditStart&gt;&gt;</u> and <u>&lt;&lt;TreeViewEditEnd&gt;&gt;</u>.  The column index
       is passed in %x, and the entry-row index is passed in %y.  eg.

              treeview .t
              bind .t &lt;&lt;TreeViewEditStart&gt;&gt; {EditStart %W %x %y}
              bind .t &lt;&lt;TreeViewEditEnd&gt;&gt; {EditEnd %W %x %y}

       These  gain  control  at  the  start  and  end  of  editing respectively, and are general alternatives to
       <u>-editopts</u> -startcmd and -endcmd.  For further details see <u>blt::tv::EditCell</u> in <b>$blt_library/treeview.tcl</b>.

</pre><h4><b>TREEVIEW</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the <b>configure</b> operation, widget configuration options may also be set  by  the  Tk  <b>option</b>
       command.  The class resource name is <b>TreeView</b>.

              option add *TreeView.Foreground white
              option add *TreeView.Background blue

              Set a style to use on every other row.  This provides a simple way to  implement  alternating  row
              colors  without  explicitly  setting entry options.  Note <b>-altstyle</b> has limitations.  Mostly it is
              used for setting the background, foreground and tile.  Currently the font  will  not  be  used  in
              height sizing, and the icon is ignored.

       <b>-autocreate</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If  <u>boolean</u>  is  true,  automatically  create  missing  ancestor  nodes  when inserting new nodes.

              Specifies a Tcl script to be invoked when a node is closed.  You can overrider this for individual
              entries using the entry's <b>-closecommand</b> option. The default  is  <b>""</b>.   Percent  substitutions  are
              performed on <u>string</u> before it is executed.  The following substitutions are valid:

              <b>%W</b>   The pathname of the widget.

              <b>%p</b>   The name of the node.

              <b>%P</b>   The full pathname of the node.

       <b>-exportselection</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Indicates  if  the  selection  is exported.  If the widget is exporting its selection then it will
              observe the standard X11 protocols for handling the selection.  Selections are available  as  type
              <b>STRING</b>; the value of the selection will be the label of the selected nodes, separated by newlines.
              The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>-fillnull</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Indicates that empty data columns are to be drawn anyways, and to apply the <u>-nullstyle</u> if defined.

              <u>scriptcmd</u>  as  per <u>find</u> <u>-exec</u>.  The called command returns the value to be displayed.  This may be
              overridden by column or style <b>-formatcmd</b>.  For the tree column, has no effect when using -showfull
              with -flat.

       <b>-hidedataicons</b> <u>boolean</u>

              default is <b>black</b>.

       <b>-highlightthickness</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Specifies the width of the highlight rectangle indicating when the widget  has  input  focus.  The
              value  may  have  any  of  the  forms  acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  If the value is zero, no focus
              highlight will be displayed.  The default is <b>2</b>.

       <b>-icons</b> <u>images</u>
              Specifies images for the entry's icon.  <u>Images</u> is a list of two Tk  images:  the  first  image  is

              <u>-exec</u>, with the image name being used as the value (%V).  The called command can either modify the
              image or set a new icon.

              The main use of <b>-imagecmd</b> is to perform image loading on demand as they  become  visible  for  the
              first  time.   To  use it, an icon option must be set with a placeholder image.  When this becomes
              visible the first time, the callback will replaces it with a real image.  The  callback  may  also
              add tags, styles or even dynamically load data, eg.

                proc ICMD {w id col img} {
                  $w entry conf $id -icon blt::tv::normalFile
                  #$img conf -file [GetFile $id $col]
                  $w tag add addimg $id

              Enables  that  data  column  values  that  start  with  a  <b>@</b> and are a list of length 2, are to be
              interpreted as an inline style or image name.  If value is the  name  of  an  image,  a  style  is
              created  using  the name of image with -icon set to that image.  A style is applied to the cell in
              the manner of <b>style</b> <b>set</b>.  Default is <u>true</u>.

       <b>-insertfirst</b><u>num</u>
              Upon inserts use forward search of tree label for num  elements,  then  fall  back  to  a  reverse
              search.  The default is 1, which provides for very fast insertions at the begining or near the end
              of really long trees.  Set to -1 for forward search only, for example, if using <u>-allowduplicates</u>.

       <b>-leaficons</b> <u>images</u>

              a given level without explicitly setting entry options.

       <b>-linecolor</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets the color of the connecting lines drawn between entries.  The default is <b>black</b>.

       <b>-minheight</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Set the minimum height for entries.  Default is <u>0</u>.

       <b>-nextauto</b><u>num</u>
              For  inserts  at the root node, the start number for the next #auto insert.  This is automatically
              incremented at each insert which speeds up bulk #auto inserts.

       <b>-nextsubauto</b><u>num</u>
              For inserts not into the root node, the number the next child  #auto  insert  starts  it's  search
              from.  The default is <b>1</b>.

       <b>-newtags</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If  <u>boolean</u>  is true, when sharing a tree object (see the <b>-tree</b> option), don't share its tags too.
              The default is <b>0</b>.

       <b>-noautocloseleaf</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If <u>boolean</u> is true, then opening a leaf node will leave it in open mode.  The  default  is  <b>false</b>,
              which automatically sets the mode of a leaf node back to closed without invoking <b>-closecommand</b>.

       <b>-opencommand</b> <u>string</u>
              Specifies  a  Tcl  script to be invoked when a node is open.  You can override this for individual
              entries with  the  entry's  <b>-opencommand</b>  configuration  option.   The  default  is  <b>""</b>.   Percent
              substitutions  are  performed  on  <u>string</u>  before it is executed.  The following substitutions are
              valid:

              <b>%W</b>   The pathname of the widget.

              <b>%p</b>   The name of the node.

              <b>%P</b>   The full pathname of the node.

              of the widget.  In <b>hierbox</b> mode, the last entry is always drawn at the bottom of the widget.   The
              default is <b>hierbox</b>.

              <b>listbox</b>   Like  the <b>listbox</b> widget, the last entry can always be scrolled to the top of the widget
                        window.  This allows the scrollbar thumb to shrink as the last entry is scrolled upward.

              <b>hierbox</b>   Like the <b>hierbox</b> widget, the last entry can only be viewed at the bottom of  the  widget
                        window.  The scrollbar stays a constant size.

              <b>canvas</b>    Like the <b>canvas</b> widget, the entries are bound within the scrolling area.

              <u>multicell</u> then selection is for cells rather than whole nodes (rows).  The default is <b>single</b>.

       <b>-selectrelief</b> <u>relief</u>
              Specifies  the  3-D effect of the selected text in the edit window.  <u>Relief</u> indicates how the text
              should appear relative to the edit window; for example, <b>raised</b> means the  text  should  appear  to
              protrude.  The default is <b>flat</b>.

       <b>-selecttile</b> <u>image</u>
              Set a tile background image to use for selection.

       <b>-separator</b> <u>string</u>
              Specifies  the character sequence to use when splitting the path components.  The separator may be
              several characters wide (such as "::") Consecutive separators in a pathname are  treated  as  one.
              If  <u>string</u>  is the empty string, the pathnames are Tcl lists.  If <u>string</u> is the <b>none</b>, no splitting
              will is done.  Each element is a path component.   The default is <b>""</b>.

       <b>-showfull</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Show full path name when in <b>-flat</b> mode.  The default is <u>true</u>.

       <b>-sortselection</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If <u>boolean</u> is true, nodes in the selection are ordered as they  are  currently  displayed  (depth-
              first or sorted), not in the order they were selected. The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>-stylecommand</b> <u>string</u>
              Specifies  a  Tcl  command  to  handle  references  to unknown styles.  The call performs the same
              substitutions as the <u>-exec</u> option in the <b>find</b> command, except <u>string</u> is used for <b>%V</b>.   The  called
              command is expected to create the style.  The default values is <b>"%W</b> <b>style</b> <b>create</b> <b>textbox</b> <b>%V"</b>.

              Dynamic  creation  is  performed for any style used in the <b>configure</b> subcommands.  It also handles

              Provides  information  used  when  moving  the  focus from window to window via keyboard traversal
              (e.g., Tab and Shift-Tab).  If <u>focus</u> is <b>0</b>, this means that this window should be skipped  entirely
              during  keyboard  traversal.   <b>1</b> means that the this window should always receive the input focus.
              An empty value means that the traversal scripts make the decision whether to focus on the  window.
              The default is <b>"1"</b>.

       <b>-tree</b> <u>tree</u>
              Use  an  externally  created  data  <u>tree</u>  object.   Using  a <b>tree</b> command facilitates data access,
              tracing, and loading/saving. eg.

                set t [tree create]
                set n 0
                while {[incr n]&lt;30000} {

              Draw  an  underline  of  the  given  height  below  each  entry  across  its entire width.  Use in
              conjunction with column reliefs this provides a grid like effect.  The default height is 0.

       <b>-width</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Sets the requested width of the widget.  If <u>pixels</u> is 0,  then  the  with  is  computed  from  the

       <b>-xscrollcommand</b> <u>string</u>
              Specifies  the  prefix for a command used to communicate with horizontal scrollbars.  Whenever the
              horizontal view in the widget's window  changes,  the  widget  will  generate  a  Tcl  command  by
              concatenating  the  scroll  command  and  two  numbers.   If this option is not specified, then no
              command will be executed.

              concatenating the scroll command and two numbers.  If  this  option  is  not  specified,  then  no
              command will be executed.

       <b>-yscrollincrement</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Sets the vertical scrolling distance. The default is 20 pixels.

</pre><h4><b>ENTRY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Many  widget  configuration  options have counterparts in entries.  For example, there is a <b>-closecommand</b>
       configuration option for both widget itself and for individual entries.  Options set at the widget  level
       are  global  for  all  entries.   If  the entry configuration option is set, then it overrides the widget
       option.  This is done to avoid wasting memory by replicated options.  Most entries  will  have  redundant
       options.

       There is no resource class or name for entries.

       <b>-activeicons</b> <u>images</u>
              Specifies  images to be displayed as the entry's icon when it is active. This overrides the global
              <b>-activeicons</b> configuration option for the specific entry.  <u>Images</u> is a list of two Tk images:  the
              first image is displayed when the node is open, the second when it is closed.

       <b>-bindtags</b> <u>tagList</u>
              Specifies the binding tags for nodes.  <u>TagList</u> is a list of binding tag names.  The tags and their
              order  will determine how events are handled for nodes.  Each tag in the list matching the current
              event sequence will have its Tcl command executed.  The default value is <b>all</b>.

       <b>-button</b> <u>string</u>
              Indicates whether a button should be displayed on the left side of the node entry.  <u>String</u> can  be
              <b>yes</b>,  <b>no</b>,  or  <b>auto</b>.   If <b>auto</b>, then a button is automatically displayed if the node has children.
              This is the default.

       <b>-closecommand</b> <u>string</u>
              Specifies a Tcl script to be  invoked  when  the  node  is  closed.   This  overrides  the  global
              <b>-closecommand</b>  option  for this entry.  The default is <b>""</b>.  Percent substitutions are performed on
              <u>string</u> before it is executed.  The following substitutions are valid:

              <b>%W</b>   The pathname of the widget.

              <b>%p</b>   The name of the node.

              <b>%P</b>   The full pathname of the node.

              <b>%#</b>   The id of the node.

       <b>-data</b> <u>list</u>
              Initializes or change data fields for the node.  <u>List</u> is a list of name-value  pairs  to  be  set.
              Note,  this  can  not  be  used  to unset or forget values for columns, meaning an empty list does
              nothing.  For unsetting use <b>entry</b> <b>unset</b>.  The default is <b>""</b>.

       <b>-font</b> <u>fontName</u>
              Sets the font for entry row text.  This overrides the widget's <b>-font</b> option for this node.

       <b>-forcetree</b> <u>bool</u>
              Force node to be treated as a tree, even if it has no children.  This differs from  <u>-button</u>  above
              in that all drawing and querying aspects of the node are treated as a tree.  This option is useful
              primarily for deferring loading until a tree is opened.  The default is <b>false</b>.

       <b>-foreground</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets  the  text  color  of the entry label.  This overrides the widget's <b>-foreground</b> configuration
              option.  The default is <b>""</b>.

       <b>-height</b> <u>num</u>
              Set height for entry.

              node is open, the second when it is closed.

       <b>-isopen</b> <u>bool</u>
              Specify if the entries is in the open state.  The default is <b>false</b>.

       <b>-label</b> <u>string</u>
              Sets the text for the entry's displayed label.  If set to  <b>""</b>, the  label  of  the  tree  node  is
              displayed The default is <b>""</b>  (see <b>entry</b> <b>relabel</b>).

       <b>-opencommand</b> <u>string</u>
              Specifies  a  Tcl  script  to  be  invoked  when the entry is opened.  This overrides the widget's
              <b>-opencommand</b> option for this node.  The default is <b>""</b>.  Percent  substitutions  are  performed  on
              <u>string</u> before it is executed.  The following substitutions are valid:

              <b>%W</b>   The pathname of the widget.

              <b>%p</b>   The name of the node.

              <b>%P</b>   The full pathname of the node.

              <b>%#</b>   The id of the node.

              <b>%%</b>   Translates to a single percent.

       <b>-state</b> <u>value</u>
              Set  the state of the entry where <u>value</u> is one of: <b>normal</b>, <b>active</b>, <b>disabled</b>.  The default state is
              <b>normal</b>.  When the state is set to <b>disabled</b>, the text color displays using <b>-disabledforeground</b>  and
              the node ignores any attempted <b>open</b> or <b>close</b>.

       <b>-style</b> <u>stylename</u>
              Set  the  style  to use for the entry. This will override the column style, just as <u>style</u> <u>set</u> will
              override an entry style.  This is useful mostly for seting bg/fg/font for a  row.   Other  options
              may or may not do nothing.  Note, setting icon in a style will apply to all value columns, but not
              the tree column.

       <b>-sublabel</b> <u>string</u>
              Sets  the  text  for the entry's sub-label to be displayed to the right of the nodes <b>-label</b> value.
              This is rendered using the <b>-substyle</b> style.

</pre><h4><b>COLUMN</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Column  configuration  options  may  also be set by the <b>option</b> command.  The resource subclass is <b>Column</b>.
       The resource name is the name of the column.

              option add *TreeView.Column.Foreground white
              option add *TreeView.treeView.Background blue

       The following configuration options are available for columns.

       <b>-activetitlebackground</b> <u>color</u>
              Active title background color.

       <b>-activetitleforeground</b> <u>color</u>
              Active title foreground color.

       <b>-autowidth</b> <u>value</u>
              If the maximum width of a column exceeds the given value, then the column width  uses  this  value
              instead  <b>-width</b>.   When  value  is  zero  or  <b>-width</b> is non-zero, has no effect.  Allows setting a
              default column width limit, while still permitting the user  to  manually  resize  larger  (unlike
              <b>-max</b>).  The default value is 0.

       <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets  the  background  color  of  the column.  This overrides the widget's <b>-background</b> option. The
              default is <b>white</b>.

       <b>-bindtags</b> <u>string</u>
              Set binding tags for column.

       <b>-borderwidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Sets the width of the 3-D border of the column.  The <b>-relief</b> option determines if a border  is  to
              be drawn.  The default is <b>0</b>.

       <b>-colorpattern</b> <u>patcolors</u>
              Alter  foreground  color based on a string match against the cell data value.  Pattern/color pairs
              are specified in <u>patcolors</u>.  If the pattern matches, then color becomes the foreground of the data
              cell.  This provides a low-overhead way to display different colors depending only on the form  of
              data.

       <b>-colorregexp</b> <u>patcolors</u>
              Does the same thing as <b>-colorpattern</b>, except uses regexp instead, and has a lower priority.

       <b>-command</b> <u>string</u>
              Set  command  for  use  by <b>invoke</b>.  This is called everytime the column is selected.  For example,
              sortable columns can be enabled by a setting this to <u>{blt::tv::SortColumn</u> <u>%W</u>  <u>%C}</u>,  or  sort  tree
              children  of  with  <u>{blt::tv::SortTree</u>  <u>%W</u>  <u>%C}</u>.   Note that SortColumn can temporarily change the
              treeview mode to -flat.  The following substitutions are valid:

              <b>%W</b>   The pathname of the widget.

              <b>%C</b>   The column identifier.

              <b>%%</b>   Translates to a single percent.

       <b>-edit</b> <u>num</u>
              Indicates if the column's data fields can be edited via the builtin editing facility.  If  <u>num</u>  is
              True the data fields in the column can be edited.  The default is <b>False</b>.

       <b>-editopts</b> <u>values</u>
              Sub-option  pair  settings  for  the  builtin text edit facilty implemented by <u>::blt::tv::EditCol</u>.

              partial documentation of the fBtextbox (or see <u>::blt::tv::EditCol</u> <u>$blt_library/treeview.tcl</u>).

              <u>-allowtypes</u> <u>type</u>
                   List of types to allow text editing for, or <b>*</b> for all.  The default is  <b>textbox</b>.

                   Automatically  use either an entry, spinbox or text as appropriate.  The default is to use an
                   entry widget.  Text containing newlines will use a text widget.  A column with combobox style
                   where -choices or -choicecmd is set will use a spinbox.

              <u>-choices</u> <u>list</u>
                   List of choices for spinbox/combo.

              <u>-conf</u> <u>values</u>

                   <b>place</b> is used to manage the window.  The default is <u>False</u>.  An embedded window has advantages
                   but  will  result in a re-layout at the begin and end of editing.  Note: place is always used
                   for the tree column.

              <u>-endcmd</u> <u>cmd</u>
                   Command to call at end of edit, after the new value is set.  If a percent is  found,  command

                   which are additional options as accepted by <u>-editopts</u>.  To  indicate  that  a  cell  is  non-
                   editable, return <b>{-readonly</b> <b>True}</b>.

              <u>-readonly</u> <u>bool</u>

              calling,  the  id  is appended.  The new value should be returned.  For tree columns the result is
              used to set the entry label, otherwise it sets a data cell value.  If  an  error  is  raised,  the
              value is set to the empty string.

              Here  is  an example that loads a large tree.  It demonstrates that only the first dozen or so are
              update initially, and more as you scroll.  A practical example might load data from a database.

                set t [tree create]
                $t create -num 10000
                pack [treeview .t -tree $t]

       If the data does not provide a valid window it is silently ignored and nothing is displayed.  If multiple
       cells try to display the same widget simultaneously, only the first one appears.   The  normal  Tk  slave
       window rules apply (ie. must be child of the parent).

</pre><h4><b>OLD</b> <b>TEXT</b> <b>EDITING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SECTION</b> <b>OBSOLETE</b>.

       This  section  is  obsolete  and  has  been  replaced  with builtin editing using a Tk entry widget.  See
       <b>TREEVIEW</b> <b>EDITING</b> above.

       Text edit window configuration options may also be set by the Tk <b>option</b> command. The  resource  class  is
       <b>TreeViewEditor</b>.  The resource name is always <b>edit</b>.

              option add *TreeViewEditor.Foreground white
              option add *edit.Background blue

       The following are the configuration options available for the text editing window.

       <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets the background of the text edit window.  The default is <b>white</b>.

       <b>-borderwidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Sets  the  width  of  the  3-D  border around the edit window.  The <b>-relief</b> option determines if a
              border is to be drawn.  The default is <b>1</b>.

       <b>-exportselection</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Indicates if the text selection is exported.  If the edit window is exporting its  selection  then
              it  will  observe the standard X11 protocols for handling the selection.  Selections are available
              as type <b>STRING</b>.  The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>-relief</b> <u>relief</u>
              Specifies the 3-D effect of the edit window.  <u>Relief</u> indicates how the  background  should  appear
              relative  to  the edit window; for example, <b>raised</b> means the background should appear to protrude.
              The default is <b>solid</b>.

       <b>-selectbackground</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets the background of the selected text in the edit window.  The default is <b>white</b>.

       <b>-selectborderwidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Sets the width of the 3-D border around the selected text in the edit window.   The  <b>-selectrelief</b>

       <b>-selectrelief</b> <u>relief</u>
              Specifies  the  3-D effect of the selected text in the edit window.  <u>Relief</u> indicates how the text
              should appear relative to the edit window; for example, <b>raised</b> means the  text  should  appear  to
              protrude.  The default is <b>flat</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk  automatically  creates  class bindings for treeviews that give them Motif-like behavior.  Much of the
       behavior of a <b>treeview</b> widget is determined by its <b>-selectmode</b> option, which selects one of two  ways  of
       dealing with the selection.

       If  the  selection mode is <b>single</b>, only one node can be selected at a time.  Clicking button 1 on an node
       selects it and deselects any other selected item.

       If the selection mode is <b>multiple</b>, any number of entries may be selected at once, including discontiguous
       ranges.  Clicking Control-Button-1 on a node entry toggles its  selection  state  without  affecting  any
       other entries.  Pressing Shift-Button-1 on a node entry selects it, extends the selection.

       [0]    The virtual event &lt;&lt;TreeViewFocusEvent&gt;&gt; is generated for each keyboard and mouse initiated change
              in focus.  It is up to the user to determine if the focus actually changed.

       [1]    In <b>extended</b> mode, the selected range can be adjusted by pressing button 1 with the Shift key down:
              this  modifies  the selection to consist of the entries between the anchor and the entry under the
              mouse, inclusive.  The un-anchored end of this new selection can also be dragged with  the  button
              down.

       [2]    In  <b>extended</b>  mode,  pressing  button  1  with the Control key down starts a toggle operation: the
              anchor is set to the entry under the mouse, and its selection state is  reversed.   The  selection
              state  of  other  entries  isn't  changed.   If  the mouse is dragged with button 1 down, then the
              selection state of all entries between the anchor and the entry under the mouse is  set  to  match
              that of the anchor entry;  the selection state of all other entries remains what it was before the
              toggle operation began.

       [3]    If  the  mouse  leaves  the  treeview  window with button 1 down, the window scrolls away from the
              mouse, making information visible that used to be off-screen  on  the  side  of  the  mouse.   The
              scrolling  continues  until  the mouse re-enters the window, the button is released, or the end of
              the hierarchy is reached.

       [4]    Mouse button 2 may be used for scanning.  If it is pressed and dragged over the  <b>treeview</b>  widget,
              the contents of the hierarchy drag at high speed in the direction the mouse moves.

       [5]    If  the  Up or Down key is pressed, the location cursor (active entry) moves up or down one entry,
              as does Control-p and Control-n.  If the selection mode is <b>browse</b> or <b>extended</b> then the new  active
              entry  is  also  selected  and  all other entries are deselected.  In <b>extended</b> mode the new active
              entry becomes the selection anchor.

       [6]    In <b>extended</b> mode, Shift-Up and Shift-Down move the location cursor (active entry) up or  down  one
              entry  and  also  extend  the  selection to that entry in a fashion similar to dragging with mouse
              button 1.

       [7]    The Left and Right keys scroll the <b>treeview</b> widget view  left  and  right  by  the  width  of  the
              character <b>0</b>.  Control-Left and Control-Right scroll the <b>treeview</b> widget view left and right by the
              width of the window.

       [8]    The Prior and Next keys scroll the <b>treeview</b> widget view up and down by one page (the height of the
              window), as does Control-u and Control-d.

       [9]    The  Home  and  End  keys  scroll  the  <b>treeview</b>  widget horizontally to the left and right edges,
              respectively.

       [10]   Control-Home sets the location cursor to the  first  entry,  selects  that  entry,  and  deselects
              everything else in the widget.

       [11]   Control-End  sets  the  location  cursor  to  the  last  entry,  selects that entry, and deselects
              everything else in the widget.

       [12]   In <b>extended</b> mode, Control-Shift-Home extends the selection to the first entry  and  Control-Shift-
              End extends the selection to the last entry.

       [13]   In  <b>multiple</b>  mode,  Control-Shift-Home  moves the location cursor to the first entry and Control-
              Shift-End moves the location cursor to the last entry.

       [14]   The space and Select keys make a selection at the location cursor (active entry) just as if  mouse
              button 1 had been pressed over this entry.

       [15]   In  <b>extended</b>  mode,  Control-Shift-space and Shift-Select extend the selection to the active entry
              just as if button 1 had been pressed with the Shift key down.

       [16]   In <b>extended</b> mode, the Escape key cancels the most recent selection and restores all the entries in
              the selected range to their previous selection state.

       [17]   Control-slash selects everything in the widget, except in <b>single</b> and <b>browse</b> modes, in  which  case
              it selects the active entry and deselects everything else.

       [18]   Control-backslash  deselects  everything  in  the  widget,  except  in <b>browse</b> mode where it has no
              effect.

       [19]   The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w copies the selection in the  widget
              to the clipboard, if there is a selection.

       The  behavior  of  <b>treeview</b>  widgets can be changed by defining new bindings for individual widgets or by
       redefining the class bindings.

   <b>WIDGET</b> <b>BINDINGS</b>
       In addition to the above behavior, the following additional behavior is defined  by  the  default  widget
       class (TreeView) bindings.

       <b>&lt;ButtonPress-2&gt;</b>
              Starts scanning.

</pre><h4><b>QUICKSTART</b></h4><pre>
       TreeFill is a utility function to simplify tree data loading from a human-readable  string.   The  string
       uses  line  indentation to indicate tree depth.  The indentation is in multiples of 4 spaces, relative to
       the first line. eg.

               pack [treeview .t]
               .t column insert end X Y Z
               blt::tv::TreeFill .t {
                   A 1 2 3
                   B 4 5 6
                       x 7 8 9
                       y 10 11 12
                           a 1 2 "Level a"
                           b 1 2 "Level b"
                   C 1 2 3
               }
               .t open -trees all
               .t entry conf 0-&gt;B-&gt;y-&gt;a -state disabled

       Any column names not defined are generated.  To load a table instead of a  tree,  simply  set  the  -flat
       option first. eg.

               pack [treeview .t -flat 1]
               .t column conf #0 -hide 1
               .t column insert end Name Age Sex
               blt::tv::TreeFill .t {
                   "Tom Brown" 9 M
                   "Mike Small" 8 M
                   "Tina Baker" 7 F
               }

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>treeview</b> command creates a new widget.

              treeview .t -bg white

       A  new Tcl command <b>.t</b> is also created.  This command can be used to query and modify the <b>treeview</b> widget.
       For example, to change the background color of the table to "green", you use  the  new  command  and  the
       widget's <b>configure</b> operation.

              # Change the background color.
              .t configure -background "green"

       By  default,  the  <b>treeview</b>  widget will automatically create a new tree object to contain the data.  The
       name of the new tree is the pathname of the widget.  Above, the new tree object name is  ".t".   But  you
       can use the <b>-tree</b> option to specify the name of another tree.

              # View the tree "myTree".
              .t configure -tree "myTree"

       When  a  new tree is created, it contains only a root node.  The node is automatically opened.  The id of
       the root node is always <b>0</b> (you can use also use the special id  <b>root</b>).  The  <b>insert</b>  operation  lets  you
       insert one or more new entries into the tree.  The last argument is the node's <u>pathname</u>.

              # Create a new entry named "myEntry"
              set id [.t insert end "myEntry"]

       This  appends  a  new node named "myEntry".  It will positioned as the last child of the root of the tree
       (using the position "end").  You can supply another position to order the node within its siblings.

              # Prepend "fred".
              set id [.t insert 0 "fred"]

       Entry names do not need to be unique.  By default, the node's label is its name.  To supply  a  different
       text label, add the <b>-label</b> option.

              # Create a new node named "fred"
              set id [.t insert end "fred" -label "Fred Flintstone"]

       The  <b>insert</b>  operation  returns the id of the new node.  You can also use the <b>index</b> operation to get this
       information.

              # Get the id of "fred"
              .t index "fred"

       To insert a node somewhere other than root, use the <b>-at</b> switch.  It takes the id of the  node  where  the
       new child will be added.

              # Create a new node "barney" in "fred".
              .t insert end "barney" -at $id

       A  pathname describes the path to an entry in the hierarchy.  It's a list of entry names that compose the
       path in the tree.  Therefore, you can also add "barney" to "fred" as follows.

              # Create a new sub-entry of "fred"
              .t insert end "fred barney"

       Every name in the list is ancestor of the next.  All ancestors must already exist.  That  means  that  an
       entry  "fred"  is  an  ancestor  of  "barney"  and  must  already exist.  But you can use the <b>-autocreate</b>
       configuration option to force the creation of ancestor nodes.

              # Force the creation of ancestors.
              .t configure -autocreate yes
              .t insert end "fred barney wilma betty"

       Sometimes the pathname is already separated by a character sequence rather than formed as a list.  A file
       name is a good example of this.  You can use the <b>-separator</b> option to specify a separator string to split
       the path into its components.  Each pathname inserted is automatically split using the  separator  string
       as a separator.  Multiple separators are treated as one.

              .t configure -separator /
              .t insert end "/usr/local/tcl/bin"

       If  the  path  is  prefixed  by  extraneous characters, you can automatically trim it off using the <b>-trim</b>
       option.  It removed the string from the path before it is parsed.

              .t configure -trim C:/windows -separator /
              .t insert end "C:/window/system"

       You can delete entries with the <b>delete</b> operation.  It takes one or more tags of ids as its  argument.  It
       deletes the entry and all its children.

              .t delete $id

       Entries  have  several configuration options.  They control the appearance of the entry's icon and label.
       We have already seen the <b>-label</b> option that sets the entry's text label.   The <b>entry</b> <b>configure</b>  operation
       lets you set or modify an entry's configuration options.

              .t entry configure $id -color red -font fixed

       You can hide an entry and its children using the <b>-hide</b> option.

              .t entry configure $id -hide yes

       More  that  one  entry  can  be  configured  at once.  All entries specified are configured with the same
       options.

              .t entry configure $i1 $i2 $i3 $i4 -color brown
              # or ...
              .t entry configure [list $i1 $i2 $i3 $i4] -color brown

       An icon is displayed for each entry.  It's a Tk image drawn to the left of the label.  You  can  set  the
       icon  with  the  entry's  <b>-icons</b>  option.   It takes a list of two image names: one to represent the open
       entry, another when it is closed.

              set im1 [image create photo -file openfolder.gif]
              set im2 [image create photo -file closefolder.gif]
              .t entry configure $id -icons "$im1 $im2"

       If <b>-icons</b> is set to the empty string, no icons are display.

       If an entry has children, a button is displayed to the left of the  icon.  Clicking  the  mouse  on  this
       button  opens or closes the sub-hierarchy.  The button is normally a <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> symbol, but can be configured
       in a variety of ways using the <b>button</b> <b>configure</b> operation.  For example, the  <b>+</b>  and  <b>-</b>  symbols  can  be
       replaced with Tk images.

              set im1 [image create photo -file closefolder.gif]
              set im2 [image create photo -file downarrow.gif]
              .t button configure $id -images "$im1 $im2" \
                  -openrelief raised -closerelief raised

       Entries  can  contain  an  arbitrary  number of <u>data</u> <u>fields</u>.  Data fields are name-value pairs.  Both the
       value and name are strings.  The entry's <b>-data</b> option lets you set data fields.

              .t entry configure $id -data {mode 0666 group users}

       The <b>-data</b> takes a list of name-value pairs.

       You can display these data fields as <u>columns</u> in the  <b>treeview</b>  widget.   You  can  create  and  configure
       columns with the <b>column</b> operation.  For example, to add a new column to the widget, use the <b>column</b> <b>insert</b>
       operation.  The last argument is the name of the data field that you want to display.

              .t column insert end "mode"

       The  column  title  is  displayed at the top of the column.  By default, it's is the field name.  You can
       override this using the column's <b>-title</b> option.

              .t column insert end "mode" -title "File Permissions"

       Columns have several configuration options.  The <b>column</b> <b>configure</b> operation  lets  you  query  or  modify
       column options.

              .t column configure "mode" -justify left

       The  <b>-justify</b>  option  says  how  the data is justified within in the column.  The <b>-hide</b> option indicates
       whether the column is displayed.

              .t column configure "mode" -hide yes

       Entries can be selected by clicking on the mouse.  Selected entries are drawn using the colors  specified
       by the <b>-selectforeground</b> and <b>-selectbackground</b> configuration options.  The selection itself is managed by
       the <b>selection</b> operation.

              # Clear all selections
              .t selection clear 0 end
              # Select the root node
              .t selection set 0

       The <b>curselection</b> operation returns a list of ids of all the selected entries.

              set ids [.t curselection]

       You can use the <b>get</b> operation to convert the ids to their pathnames.

              set names [eval .t get -full $ids]

       If  a  treeview  is exporting its selection (using the <b>-exportselection</b> option), then it will observe the
       standard X11 protocols for handling the selection.  Treeview selections are available as type <b>STRING</b>; the
       value of the selection will be the pathnames of the selected entries, separated by newlines.

       The <b>treeview</b> supports two modes of selection: <b>single</b> and <b>multiple</b>.  In single select mode, only one entry
       can be selected at a time, while multiple select mode allows several entries to be selected.  The mode is
       set by the widget's <b>-selectmode</b> option.

              .t configure -selectmode "multiple"

       You can be notified when the list of selected entries changes.  The widget's <b>-selectcommand</b>  specifies  a
       Tcl procedure that is called whenever the selection changes.

              proc SelectNotify { widget } {
                 set ids [$widget curselection]
              }
              .t configure -selectcommand "SelectNotify .t"

       The  widget  supports  the  standard  Tk  scrolling  and  scanning  operations.  The <b>treeview</b> can be both
       horizontally and vertically. You can attach scrollbars to the <b>treeview</b> the same way  as  the  listbox  or
       canvas widgets.

              scrollbar .xbar -orient horizontal -command ".t xview"
              scrollbar .ybar -orient vertical -command ".t yview"
              .t configure -xscrollcommand ".xbar set" \
                  -yscrollcommand ".ybar set"

       Entries can be programmatically opened or closed using the <b>open</b> and <b>close</b> operations respectively.

              .t open $id
              .t close $id

       When an entry is opened, a Tcl procedure can be automatically invoked.  The <b>-opencommand</b> option specifies
       this procedure.  This procedure can lazily insert entries as needed.

              proc AddEntries { dir } {
                 eval .t insert end [glob -nocomplain $dir/*]
              }
              .t configure -opencommand "AddEntries %P"

       Now  when  an entry is opened, the procedure <b>AddEntries</b> is called and adds children to the entry.  Before
       the command is invoked, special "%" substitutions (like <b>bind</b>) are performed. Above, <b>%P</b> is  translated  to
       the pathname of the entry.

       The same feature exists when an entry is closed.  The <b>-closecommand</b> option specifies the procedure.

              proc DeleteEntries { id } {
                 .t entry delete $id 0 end
              }
              .t configure -closecommand "DeleteEntries %#"

       When an entry is closed, the procedure <b>DeleteEntries</b> is called and deletes the entry's children using the
       <b>entry</b> <b>delete</b> operation (<b>%#</b> is the id of entry).

</pre><h4><b>OLD</b> <b>TREEVIEW</b> <b>EDITS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NOTE:</b> <b>This</b> <b>section</b> <b>is</b> <b>OBSOLETE.</b>  <b>Native</b> <b>Tk</b> <b>widgets</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>editing.</b>.

       When editing the subwidget .edit is available.

       <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <u>operation</u> ?<u>args</u>?
              This  operation  is  used  to  provide  text  editing for cells (data fields in a column) or entry
              labels.  It has several forms, depending on <u>operation</u>:

              <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <b>apply</b>
                     Applies the edited buffer, replacing the entry label or data  field.  The  edit  window  is
                     hidden.

              <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <b>cancel</b>
                     Cancels the editing operation, reverting the entry label or data value back to the previous
                     value. The edit window is hidden.

              <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <b>cget</b> <u>value</u>
                     Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any
                     of the values accepted by the <b>configure</b> operation described below.

              <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?
                     Query  or  modify the configuration options of the edit window.  If no <u>option</u> is specified,
                     returns  a  list  describing  all  of  the  available  options  (see  <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>  for
                     information  on  the  format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the
                     command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to  the
                     corresponding  sublist  of  the  value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more
                     <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget  option(s)  to
                     have  the  given  value(s);   in this case the command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> and
                     <u>value</u> are described in the section <b>TEXT</b> <b>EDITING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> below.

       <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <b>delete</b> <u>first</u> <u>last</u>
              Deletes the characters in the edit buffer between the two given character positions.

       <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <b>get</b> ?<u>-root</u>? <u>x</u> <u>y</u>

       <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <b>icursor</b> <u>index</u>

       <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <b>index</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns the text index of given <u>index</u>.

       <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <b>insert</b> <u>index</u> <u>string</u>
              Insert the text string <u>string</u> into the edit buffer at the index <u>index</u>.  For example, the  index  0
              will prepend the buffer.

       <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <b>selection</b> <u>args</u>
              This  operation  controls  the  selection  of the editing window.  Note that this differs from the
              selection of entries.  It has the following forms:

              <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <b>selection</b> <b>adjust</b> <u>index</u>
                     Adjusts either the first or last index of the selection.

              <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <b>selection</b> <b>clear</b>
                     Clears the selection.

              <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <b>selection</b> <b>from</b> <u>index</u>
                     Sets the anchor of the selection.

              <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <b>selection</b> <b>present</b>
                     Indicates if a selection is present.

              <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <b>selection</b> <b>range</b> <u>start</u> <u>end</u>
                     Sets both the anchor and mark of the selection.

              <u>pathName.</u><b>edit</b> <b>selection</b> <b>to</b> <u>index</u>
                     Sets the unanchored end (mark) of the selection.

</pre><h4><b>LABEL</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       Entries take a <b>-label</b> option that can be used to specify the text to display.  This is not the same thing
       as the node label.

       By default labels are checked for duplicates by  <b>insert</b>,  which  can  slow  down  large  (10k+)  inserts.
       Setting <b>-allowduplicates</b> to 1 disables this checking.

       An  entries  label  can  be  changed either by by setting <b>-allowduplicates</b> to 1 and using treeviews <b>entry</b>
       <b>relabel</b> or by using trees <b>label</b> command.

       Instead of lists, a separator can be specified with <b>-separator</b>.  Thus for managing files we might use:

               treeview .t -separator / -autocreate 1
               .t insert end  mann/text.n mann/canvas.n
               .t insert end  Help Search Close -at root-&gt;mann-&gt;text.n
               pack .t

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Text cells in display height can be at most 64K pixels high per row.
