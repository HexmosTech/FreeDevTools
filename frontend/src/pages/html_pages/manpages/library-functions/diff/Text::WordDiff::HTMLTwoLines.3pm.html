</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       This class subclasses Text::WordDiff::Base to provide a XHTML formatting for Text::WordDiff. See
       Term::WordDiff for usage details. This class should never be used directly.

       Text::WordDiff::HTMLTwoLines formats word diffs for viewing in a Web browser.  The output is similar to
       that produced by Term::WordDiff::HTML but the two lines (or files, records, etc.) are shown separately,
       with deleted items highlighted in the first line and inserted items highlighted in the second.
       HTMLTwoLines puts a span tag around each word or set of words in the diff.

       The diff content is highlighted as follows:

       •   "&lt;div class="file"&gt;"

           The  inputs  to  "word_diff()" are each contained in a div element of class "file". All the following
           results are subsumed by these elements.

           •   "&lt;span class="fileheader"&gt;"

               The header section for the files being "diff"ed, usually something like:

                 --- in.txt    Thu Sep  1 12:51:03 2005

               for the first file, and

                 +++ out.txt   Thu Sep  1 12:52:12 2005

               for the second.

               This element immediately follows the opening "file" "&lt;div&gt;" element, but will not be  present  if
               Text::WordDiff cannot determine the file names for both files being compared.

           •   "&lt;span class="hunk"&gt;"

               This element contains a single diff "hunk". Each hunk may contain the following elements:

               •   "&lt;ins&gt;"

                   Inserted content.

               •   "&lt;del&gt;"

                   Deleted content.

       You  may  do  whatever  you  like with these elements and classes; I highly recommend that you style them
       using CSS. You'll find an example CSS file in the <u>eg</u> directory in the Text-WordDiff distribution.
