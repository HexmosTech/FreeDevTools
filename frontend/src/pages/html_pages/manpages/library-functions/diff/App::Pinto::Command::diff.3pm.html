</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Pinto::Command::diff - show difference between two stacks

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.14

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         pinto --root=REPOSITORY_ROOT diff [OPTIONS] LEFT [RIGHT]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       !! THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL !!

       This command shows the difference between two stacks or revisions, presented in a format similar to
       diff[1].

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Command arguments are the names of the stacks or revision IDs to compare. If you specify a stack name,
       the head revision of that stack will be used.  If you only specify one argument, then it is assumed to be
       the RIGHT and the head revision of the default stack will be used as the LEFT.  Revision IDs can be
       truncated to uniqueness.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --diff-style=STYLE
           Controls  the  style  of  the  diff  reports.  STYLE must be either "concise" or "detailed".  Concise
           reports show only one record for each distribution added  or  deleted.   Detailed  reports  show  one
           record for every package added or deleted.

           The  default  style  is  "concise".   However,  the  default  style  can  be  changed  by setting the
           "PINTO_DIFF_STYLE" environment variable to your preferred STYLE.  This variable affects  the  default
           style for diff reports generated by all other commands too.

       --format=FORMAT
           A  "printf"-style  format  string describing how individual lines of the diff are to be printed.  For
           the description of the "FORMAT", please refer to "COMMAND OPTIONS" in App::Pinto::Command::list.

           The default format for "concise" diffs is "%o[%F] %a/%f".  The default format for "detailed" diffs is
           "%o[%F] %-40p %12v %a/%f".

   <b>EXAMPLES</b>
        pinto diff foo                  # Compare of head of default stack with head of foo stack
        pinto diff foo bar              # Compare heads of both foo and bar stack.
        pinto diff 1ae834f              # Compare head of default stack with revision 1ae834f
        pinto diff foo 1ae834f          # Compare head of foo stack with revision 1ae834f
        pinto diff 663fd2a 1ae834f      # Compare revision 663fd2a with revision 1ae834f
