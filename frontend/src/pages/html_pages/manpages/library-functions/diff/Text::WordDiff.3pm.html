           use Text::WordDiff;

           my $diff = word_diff 'file1.txt', 'file2.txt', { STYLE =&gt; 'HTML' };
           my $diff = word_diff \$string1,   \$string2,   { STYLE =&gt; 'ANSIColor' };

           my $diff = word_diff \@records1,  'file_B.txt';

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       This module is a variation on the lovely Text::Diff module.  Rather than generating traditional line-
       oriented diffs, however, it generates word-oriented diffs. This can be useful for tracking changes in
       narrative documents or documents with very long lines. To diff source code, one is still best off using
       Text::Diff. But if you want to see how a short story changed from one version to the next, this module
       will do the job very nicely.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Word?</b>
       I'm glad you asked! Well, sort of. It's a really hard question to answer. I consulted a number of
       sources, but really just did my best to punt on the question by reformulating it as, "How do I split text
       up into individual words?" The short answer is to split on word boundaries. However, every word has two
       boundaries, one at the beginning and one at the end. So splitting on "/\b/" didn't work so well. What I
       really wanted to do was to split on the <u>beginning</u> of every word. Fortunately, _Mastering Regular
       Expressions_ has a recipe for that: "/(?&lt;!\w)(?=\w)/". I've borrowed this regular expression for use in
       Perls before 5.6.x, but go for the Unicode variant in 5.6.0 and newer: "/(?&lt;!\p{IsWord})(?=\p{IsWord})/".
       Adding some additional controls for punctuation and control characters, this sentence, for example, would
       be split up into the following tokens:

         my @words = (
             "Adding ",
             "some ",
             "additional ",
             "controls",
             "\n",
             "for ",
             "punctuation ",
             "and ",
             "control ",
             "characters",
             ", ",
             "this ",
             "sentence",
             ", ",
             "for ",
             "example",
             ", ",
             "would ",
             "be",
             "\n",
             "split ",
             "up ",
             "into ",
             "the ",
             "following ",
             "tokens",
             ":",
         );

       So it's not just comparing words, but word-like tokens and control/punctuation tokens. This makes sense
       to me, at least, as the diff is between these tokens, and thus leads to a nice word-and-space-and-
       punctuation type diff. It's not unlike what a word processor might do (although a lot of them are
       character-based, but that seemed a bit extreme--feel free to dupe this module into Text::CharDiff!).

       Now, I acknowledge that there are localization issues with this approach. In particular, it will fail
       with Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text, as these languages don't put non-word characters between words.
       Ideally, Test::WordDiff would then split on every character (since a single character often equals a
       word), but such is not the case when the "utf8" flag is set on a string.  For example, This simple
       script:

         use strict;
         use utf8;
         use Data::Dumper;
         my $string = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX';
         my @tokens = split /(?&lt;!\p{IsWord})(?=\p{IsWord})/msx, $string;
         print Dumper \@tokens;

       Outputs:

         $VAR1 = [
                   "\x{bf08}\x{bf09}\x{bf18}\x{bf19}\x{bf1b}\x{bf1c}\x{bf1d}\x{bf40}\x{bf41}\x{bf44}\x{bf48}\x{bf50}\x{bf51}\x{bf55}\x{bf94}\x{bfb0}\x{bfc5}\x{bfcc}\x{bfcd}\x{bfd0}\x{bfd4}\x{bfdc}\x{bfdf}\x{bfe1}\x{c03c}\x{c051}\x{c058}\x{c05c}\x{c060}\x{c068}\x{c069}\x{c090}"
                 ];

       Not so useful. It seems to be less of a problem if the "use utf8;" line is commented out, in which case
       we get:

         $VAR1 = [
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   '?',
                   '?X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X',
                   'X'
                 ];

       Someone whose more familiar with non-space-using languages will have to explain to me how I might be able
       to duplicate this pattern within the scope of "use utf8;", seing as it may very well be important to have
       it on in order to ensure proper character semantics.

       However, if my word tokenization approach is just too naive, and you decide that you need to take a
       different approach (maybe use Lingua::ZH::Toke or similar module), you can still use this module; you'll
       just have to tokenize your strings into words yourself, and pass them to <b>word_diff()</b> as array references:

         word_diff \@my_words1, \@my_words2;

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>word_diff()</b> takes two arguments from which to draw input and an optional hash reference of options to
       control its output. The first two arguments contain the data to be diffed, and each may be in the form of
       any of the following (that is, they can be in two different formats):

       •   String

           A  bare  scalar  will  be assumed to be a file name. The file will be opened and split up into words.
           <b>word_diff()</b> will also "stat" the file to get the last modified time for use in the header, unless the
           relevant option ("MTIME_A" or "MTIME_B") has been specified explicitly.

       •   Scalar Reference

           A scalar reference will be assumed to refer to a string. That string will be split up into words.

       •   Array Reference

           An array reference will be assumed to be a list of words.

       •   File Handle

           A glob or IO::Handle-derived object will be read from and split up into its constituent words.

       The optional hash reference may contain the following options. Additional options may be specified by the
       formattting class; see the specific class for details.

       •   STYLE

           "ANSIColor",  "HTML"  or  an  object  or  class  name  for   a   class   providing   "file_header()",
           "hunk_header()",    "same_items()",    "delete_items()",    "insert_items()",   "hunk_footer()"   and
           "file_footer()" methods. Defaults to "ANSIColor"  for  nice  display  of  diffs  in  an  ANSI  Color-
           supporting terminal.

           If  the  package  indicated  by  the  "STYLE"  has  no  "new()"  method,  "word_diff()"  will load it
           automatically (lazy loading). It will then instantiate an  object  of  that  class,  passing  in  the
           options hash reference with which the formatting class can initialize the object.

           Styles  may  be  specified  as  class  names  ("STYLE  =&gt;  "My::Foo""),  in  which  case they will be
           instantiated by calling the "new()" construcctor and passing in the options  hash  reference,  or  as
           objects ("STYLE =&gt; My::Foo-&gt;new").

           The  simplest  way to implement your own formatting style is to create a new class that inherits from
           Text::WordDiff::Base, wherein the "new()" method is already provided, and the "file_header()" returns
           a Unified diff-style header. All of the other formatting methods simply return empty strings, and are
           therefore ripe for overriding.

       •   FILENAME_A, MTIME_A, FILENAME_B, MTIME_B

           The name of the file and the modification time "files" in epoch seconds.  Unless a defined  value  is
           specified  for  these  options,  they  will  be  filled in for each file when <b>word_diff()</b> is passed a
           filename. If a filename is not passed in and "FILENAME_A"  and  "FILENAME_B"  are  not  defined,  the
           header will not be printed by the base formatting base class.

       •   OUTPUT

           The method by which diff output should be, well, <u>output</u>. Examples and their equivalent subroutines:

               OUTPUT =&gt; \*FOOHANDLE,   # like: sub { print FOOHANDLE shift() }
               OUTPUT =&gt; \$output,      # like: sub { $output .= shift }
               OUTPUT =&gt; \@output,      # like: sub { push @output, shift }
               OUTPUT =&gt; sub { $output .= shift },

           If  "OUTPUT"  is  not  defined, <b>word_diff()</b> will simply return the diff as a string. If "OUTPUT" is a
           code reference, it will be called once with the file header, once for each hunk body,  and  once  for
           each  piece  of  content.  If  "OUTPUT"  is an IO::Handle-derived object, output will be sent to that
           handle.

       •   FILENAME_PREFIX_A, FILENAME_PREFIX_B

           The string to print before the filename in the header. Defaults are "---", "+++".

       •   DIFF_OPTS

           A hash reference to be passed as the options  to  "Algorithm::Diff-&gt;new".   See  Algorithm::Diff  for
           details on available options.

</pre><h4><b>Formatting</b> <b>Classes</b></h4><pre>
       Text::WordDiff comes with two formatting classes:

       Text::WordDiff::ANSIColor
           This  is the default formatting class. It emits a header and then the diff content, with deleted text
           in bodfaced red and inserted text in boldfaced green.

       Text::WordDiff::HTML
           Specify "STYLE =&gt; 'HTML'" to take advantage of this formatting class. It outputs the diff content  as
           XHTML, with deleted text in "&lt;del&gt;" elements and inserted text in "&lt;ins&gt;" elements.

       To implement your own formatting class, simply inherit from Text::WordDiff::Base and override its methods
       as  necssary.  By  default, only the "file_header()" formatting method returns a value. All others simply
       return empty strings, and are therefore ripe for overriding:

         package My::WordDiff::Format;
         use base 'Text::WordDiff::Base';

         sub file_footer { return "End of diff\n"; }

       The methods supplied by the base class are:

       "new()"
           Constructs and returns a new formatting object. It takes a single hash reference as its argument, and
           uses it to construct the object. The nice thing about this is that  if  you  want  to  support  other
           options  in  your formatting class, you can just use them in the formatting object constructed by the
           Text::WordDiff::Base class and document that they can be passed as part of the options hash  refernce
           to <b>word_diff()</b>.

       "file_header()"
           Called  once  for  a single call to "word_diff()", this method outputs the header for the whole diff.
           This is the only formatting method in the base class  that  returns  anything  other  than  an  empty
           string. It collects the filenames from "filname_a()" and "filename_b()" and, if they're defined, uses
           the relevant prefixes and modification times to return a unified diff-style header.

       "hunk_header()"
           This method is called for each diff hunk. It should output any necessary header for the hunk.

       "same_items()"
           This  method  is  called for items that have not changed between the two sequnces being compared. The
           unchanged items will be passed as a list to the method.

       "delete_items"
           This method is called for items in the first sequence that are not present in the second sequcne. The
           deleted items will be passed as a list to the method.

       "insert_items"
           This method is called for items in the second sequence that are not present in the first sequcne. The
           inserted items will be passed as a list to the method.

       "hunk_footer"
           This method is called at the end of a hunk. It should output any necessary content to close  out  the
           hunk.

       "file_footer()"
           This  method  is  called  once  when the whole diff has been procssed. It should output any necessary
           content to close out the diff file.

       "filename_a"
           This accessor returns the value specified for the "FILENAME_A" option to <b>word_diff()</b>.

       "filename_b"
           This accessor returns the value specified for the "FILENAME_B" option to <b>word_diff()</b>.

       "mtime_a"
           This accessor returns the value specified for the "MTIME_A" option to <b>word_diff()</b>.

       "mtime_b"
           This accessor returns the value specified for the "MTIME_B" option to <b>word_diff()</b>.

       "filename_prefix_a"
           This accessor returns the value specified for the "FILENAME_PREFIX_A" option to <b>word_diff()</b>.

       "filename_prefix_b"
           This accessor returns the value specified for the "FILENAME_PREFIX_B" option to <b>word_diff()</b>.
