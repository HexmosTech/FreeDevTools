       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CGEMMTR  performs one of the matrix-matrix operations

               C := alpha*op( A )*op( B ) + beta*C,

            where  op( X ) is one of

               op( X ) = X   or   op( X ) = X**T,

            alpha and beta are scalars, and A, B and C are matrices, with op( A )
            an n by k matrix,  op( B )  a  k by n matrix and  C an n by n matrix.
            Thereby, the routine only accesses and updates the upper or lower
            triangular part of the result matrix C. This behaviour can be used if
            the resulting matrix C is known to be Hermitian or symmetric.

       <b>ZGEMMTR</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            ZGEMMTR  performs one of the matrix-matrix operations

               C := alpha*op( A )*op( B ) + beta*C,

            where  op( X ) is one of

               op( X ) = X   or   op( X ) = X**T,

            alpha and beta are scalars, and A, B and C are matrices, with op( A )
            an n by k matrix,  op( B )  a  k by n matrix and  C an n by n matrix.
            Thereby, the routine only accesses and updates the upper or lower
            triangular part of the result matrix C. This behaviour can be used if
            the resulting matrix C is known to be Hermitian or symmetric.
