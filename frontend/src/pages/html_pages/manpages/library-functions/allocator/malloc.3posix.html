</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       malloc — a memory allocator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;

       void *malloc(size_t <u>size</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  <u>malloc</u>() function shall allocate unused space for an object whose size in bytes is specified by <u>size</u>
       and whose value is unspecified.

       The order and contiguity of storage allocated by successive calls to <u>malloc</u>() is unspecified. The pointer
       returned if the allocation succeeds shall be suitably aligned so that it may be assigned to a pointer  to
       any  type  of  object  and  then used to access such an object in the space allocated (until the space is
       explicitly freed or reallocated). Each such allocation shall yield a pointer to an object  disjoint  from
       any  other object. The pointer returned points to the start (lowest byte address) of the allocated space.
       If the space cannot be allocated, a null pointer shall be returned. If the size of the space requested is
       0, the behavior is implementation-defined: either a null pointer shall be returned, or the behavior shall
       be as if the size were some non-zero value, except that the behavior is undefined if the returned pointer
       is used to access an object.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion with <u>size</u> not equal to 0, <u>malloc</u>() shall return a  pointer  to  the  allocated
       space. If <u>size</u> is 0, either:

        *  A null pointer shall be returned and <u>errno</u> may be set to an implementation-defined value, or

        *  A  pointer to the allocated space shall be returned. The application shall ensure that the pointer is
           not used to access an object.

       Otherwise, it shall return a null pointer and set <u>errno</u> to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>malloc</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM</b> Insufficient storage space is available.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
