</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible - extensible authentication framework for Dancer apps

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A user authentication and authorisation framework plugin for Dancer apps.

       Makes it easy to require a user to be logged in to access certain routes, provides role-based access
       control, and supports various authentication methods/sources (config file, database, Unix system users,
       etc).

       Designed to support multiple authentication realms and to be as extensible as possible, and to make
       secure password handling easy.  The base class for auth providers makes handling "RFC2307"-style hashed
       passwords really simple, so you have no excuse for storing plain-text passwords.  A simple script to
       generate RFC2307-style hashed passwords is included, or you can use Crypt::SaltedHash yourself to do so,
       or use the "slappasswd" utility if you have it installed.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Configure the plugin to use the authentication provider class you wish to use:

         plugins:
               Auth::Extensible:
                   realms:
                       users:
                           provider: Example
                           ....

       The configuration you provide will depend on the authentication provider module in use.  For a simple
       example, see Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Config.

       Define that a user must be logged in and have the proper permissions to access a route:

           get '/secret' =&gt; require_role Confidant =&gt; sub { tell_secrets(); };

       Define that a user must be logged in to access a route - and find out who is logged in with the
       "logged_in_user" keyword:

           get '/users' =&gt; require_login sub {
               my $user = logged_in_user;
               return "Hi there, $user-&gt;{username}";
           };

</pre><h4><b>AUTHENTICATION</b> <b>PROVIDERS</b></h4><pre>
       For flexibility, this authentication framework uses simple authentication provider classes, which
       implement a simple interface and do whatever is required to authenticate a user against the chosen source
       of authentication.

       For an example of how simple provider classes are, so you can build your own if required or just try out
       this authentication framework plugin easily, see Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Example.

       This framework supplies the following providers out-of-the-box:

       Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Unix
           Authenticates users using system accounts on Linux/Unix type boxes

       Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Database
           Authenticates users stored in a database table

       Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Config
           Authenticates users stored in the app's config

       Need to write your own?  Just subclass Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Base and implement the
       required methods, and you're good to go!

</pre><h4><b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>ACCESS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>ROUTES</b></h4><pre>
       Keywords are provided to check if a user is logged in / has appropriate roles.

       require_login - require the user to be logged in
               get '/dashboard' =&gt; require_login sub { .... };

           If  the  user is not logged in, they will be redirected to the login page URL to log in.  The default
           URL is "/login" - this may be changed with the "login_page" option.

       require_role - require the user to have a specified role
               get '/beer' =&gt; require_role BeerDrinker =&gt; sub { ... };

           Requires that the user be logged in as a user who has the specified role.  If the user is not  logged
           in,  they  will  be  redirected  to  the  login page URL.  If they are logged in, but do not have the
           required role, they will be redirected to the access denied URL.

       require_any_roles - require the user to have one of a list of roles
               get '/drink' =&gt; require_any_role [qw(BeerDrinker VodaDrinker)] =&gt; sub {
                   ...
               };

           Requires that the user be logged in as a user who has any one (or more) of the roles listed.  If  the
           user  is not logged in, they will be redirected to the login page URL.  If they are logged in, but do
           not have any of the specified roles, they will be redirected to the access denied URL.

       require_all_roles - require the user to have all roles listed
               get '/foo' =&gt; require_all_roles [qw(Foo Bar)] =&gt; sub { ... };

           Requires that the user be logged in as a user who has all of the roles listed.  If the  user  is  not
           logged  in, they will be redirected to the login page URL.  If they are logged in but do not have all
           of the specified roles, they will be redirected to the access denied URL.

   <b>Replacing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Default</b> <b>"</b> <b>/login</b> <b>"</b> <b>and</b> <b>"</b> <b>/login/denied</b> <b>"</b> <b>Routes</b>
       By default, the plugin adds a route to present a simple login form at that URL.  If you would rather  add
       your own, set the "no_default_pages" setting to a true value, and define your own route which responds to
       "/login"  with  a login page.  Alternatively you can let DPAE add the routes and handle the status codes,
       etc.  and simply define the setting "login_page_handler" and/or "permission_denied_page_handler" with the
       name of a subroutine to be called to handle the route. Note that it must be a fully qualified sub. E.g.

           plugins:
             Auth::Extensible:
               login_page_handler: 'My::App:login_page_handler'
               permission_denied_page_handler: 'My::App:permission_denied_page_handler'

       Then in your code you might simply use a template:

           sub permission_denied_page_handler {
               template 'account/login';
           }

       If the user is logged in, but tries to access a route which requires a specific  role  they  don't  have,
       they will be redirected to the "permission denied" page URL, which defaults to "/login/denied" but may be
       changed using the "denied_page" option.

       Again,  by  default  a  route is added to respond to that URL with a default page; again, you can disable
       this by setting "no_default_pages" and creating your own.

       This would still leave the routes "post '/login'" and "any '/logout'" routes in place.  To  disable  them
       too,  set  the option "no_login_handler" to a true value. In this case, these routes should be defined by
       the user, and should do at least the following:

           post '/login' =&gt; sub {
               my ($success, $realm) = authenticate_user(
                   params-&gt;{username}, params-&gt;{password}
               );
               if ($success) {
                   session logged_in_user =&gt; params-&gt;{username};
                   session logged_in_user_realm =&gt; $realm;
                   # other code here
               } else {
                   # authentication failed
               }
           };

           any '/logout' =&gt; sub {
               session-&gt;destroy;
           };

       If you want to use the default "post '/login'" and "any '/logout'" routes you  can  configure  them.  See
       below.

   <b>Keywords</b>
       require_login
           Used to wrap a route which requires a user to be logged in order to access it.

               get '/secret' =&gt; require_login sub { .... };

       require_role
           Used to wrap a route which requires a user to be logged in as a user with the specified role in order
           to access it.

               get '/beer' =&gt; require_role BeerDrinker =&gt; sub { ... };

           You can also provide a regular expression, if you need to match the role using a regex - for example:

               get '/beer' =&gt; require_role qr/Drinker$/ =&gt; sub { ... };

       require_any_role
           Used  to  wrap  a route which requires a user to be logged in as a user with any one (or more) of the
           specified roles in order to access it.

               get '/foo' =&gt; require_any_role [qw(Foo Bar)] =&gt; sub { ... };

       require_all_roles
           Used to wrap a route which requires a user to be logged in as a user with all of the roles listed  in
           order to access it.

               get '/foo' =&gt; require_all_roles [qw(Foo Bar)] =&gt; sub { ... };

       logged_in_user
           Returns a hashref of details of the currently logged-in user, if there is one.

           The details you get back will depend upon the authentication provider in use.

       user_has_role
           Check if a user has the role named.

           By  default,  the  currently-logged-in  user  will  be checked, so you need only name the role you're
           looking for:

               if (user_has_role('BeerDrinker')) { pour_beer(); }

           You can also provide the username to check;

               if (user_has_role($user, $role)) { .... }

       user_roles
           Returns a list of the roles of a user.

           By default, roles for the currently-logged-in user will be checked; alternatively, you may  supply  a
           username to check.

           Returns a list or arrayref depending on context.

       authenticate_user
           Usually  you'll  want  to let the built-in login handling code deal with authenticating users, but in
           case you need to do it yourself, this keyword accepts a  username  and  password,  and  optionally  a
           specific realm, and checks whether the username and password are valid.

           For example:

               if (authenticate_user($username, $password)) {
                   ...
               }

           If you are using multiple authentication realms, by default each realm will be consulted in turn.  If
           you  only  wish  to check one of them (for instance, you're authenticating an admin user, and there's
           only one realm which applies to them), you can supply the realm as an optional third parameter.

           In boolean context, returns simply true or false; in list context, returns "($success, $realm)".

   <b>SAMPLE</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       In your application's configuration file:

           session: simple
           plugins:
               Auth::Extensible:
                   # Set to 1 if you want to disable the use of roles (0 is default)
                   disable_roles: 0
                   # After /login: If no return_url is given: land here ('/' is default)
                   user_home_page: '/user'
                   # After /logout: If no return_url is given: land here (no default)
                   exit_page: '/'

                   # List each authentication realm, with the provider to use and the
                   # provider-specific settings (see the documentation for the provider
                   # you wish to use)
                   realms:
                       realm_one:
                           provider: Database
                               db_connection_name: 'foo'

       <b>Please</b> <b>note</b> that you <b>must</b> have a session provider  configured.   The  authentication  framework  requires
       sessions  in  order  to track information about the currently logged in user.  Please see Dancer::Session
       for information on how to configure session management within your application.
