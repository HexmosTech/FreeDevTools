</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       TDMTRI - Add triangles defining a 3D marker to the triangles in a triangle list.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL TDMTRI (IMRK, UMRK, VMRK, WMRK, SMRK, RTRI, MTRI, NTRI, IRST, UMIN, VMIN, WMIN, UMAX, VMAX, WMAX)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_tdmtri(int imrk, float umrk, float vmrk, float wmrk, float smrk, float *rtri, int mtri, int *ntri,
       int irst, float umin, float vmin, float wmin, float umax, float vmax, float wmax)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The arguments of TDMTRI are as follows:

       IMRK    (an  input  expression  of  type  INTEGER)  -  has  an absolute value between 1 and 5, inclusive,
               specifying the type of marker to be generated.  If the value of  IMRK  is  less  than  zero,  the
               triangles will not be clipped against the sides of the data box, otherwise, they will.

       UMRK, VMRK, and WMRK
               (input expressions of type REAL) - the 3-space coordinates of the center point of the marker.

       SMRK    (an input expression of type REAL) - the radius of the marker in 3-space.

       RTRI    (an  input array, of type REAL, dimensioned 10 x MTRI) - a list of triangles, probably created by
               means of calls to TDSTRI, TDITRI, and/or TDMTRI, and sorted, probably  by  means  of  a  call  to
               TDOTRI.

       MTRI    (an  input expression of type INTEGER) - the second dimension of RTRI and thus the maximum number
               of triangles the triangle list will hold.

       NTRI    (an input/output variable of type INTEGER) - keeps track of the number of triangles currently  in
               the  list.   It is the user's responsibility to zero this initially and its value is increased by
               each call to a triangle-generating routine like TDMTRI. If NTRI becomes  equal  to  MTRI,  TDMTRI
               does not take an error exit; instead, it just stops generating triangles.  Therefore, it's a good
               idea,  after  calling  TDMTRI,  to check the value of NTRI against the dimension MTRI; if they're
               equal, it probably means that the triangle list filled up and that the rendered surface  will  be
               incomplete.

       IRST    (an  input expression of type INTEGER) - specifies the index of the rendering style to to be used
               for the triangles added to the triangle list by this call.

       UMIN, VMIN, WMIN, UMAX, VMAX, and WMAX
               (input expressions of type REAL) - each of these specifies one of the coordinate values  defining
               the data box in 3-space.  The names of these should make it clear what they are.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use TDMTRI or c_tdmtri, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.
