</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Config::MVP::Reader::Finder - a reader that finds an appropriate file

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.200013

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Finder reader multiplexes many other readers that implement the Config::MVP::Reader::Findable role.
       It uses Module::Pluggable to search for modules, limits them to objects implementing the Findable role,
       and then selects the those which report that they are able to read a configuration file found in the
       config root directory.  If exactly one findable configuration reader finds a file, it is used to read the
       file and the configuration sequence is returned.  Otherwise, an exception is raised.

       Config::MVP::Reader::Finder's "build_assembler" method will decline a new assembler, so if none was
       passed to "read_config", the Findable reader to which reading is delegated will be responsible for
       building the assembler, unless a Finder subclass overrides "build_assembler" to set a default across all
       possible delegates.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>default_search_path</b>
       This is the default search path used to find configuration readers.  This method should return a list,
       and by default returns:

         qw( Config::MVP::Reader )
