</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::MakeMethods::Basic - Make really simple methods

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Basic::Hash (
           'new'     =&gt; [ 'new' ],
           'scalar'  =&gt; [ 'foo', 'bar' ]
         );

         package main;

         my $obj = MyObject-&gt;new( foo =&gt; "Foozle", bar =&gt; "Bozzle" );
         print $obj-&gt;foo();
         $obj-&gt;bar("Barbados");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes the various subclasses of Class::MakeMethods included under the Basic::*
       namespace, and the method types each one provides.

       The Basic subclasses provide stripped-down method-generation implementations.

       Subroutines are generated as closures bound to each method name.

   <b>Calling</b> <b>Conventions</b>
       When you "use" a subclass of this package, the method declarations you provide as arguments cause
       subroutines to be generated and installed in your module. You can also omit the arguments to "use" and
       instead make methods at runtime by passing the declarations to a subsequent call to "make()".

       You may include any number of declarations in each call to "use" or "make()". If methods with the same
       name already exist, earlier calls to "use" or "make()" win over later ones, but within each call, later
       declarations superceed earlier ones.

       You can install methods in a different package by passing "-TargetClass =&gt; <u>package</u>" as your first
       arguments to "use" or "make".

       See "USAGE" in Class::MakeMethods for more details.

   <b>Declaration</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       The following types of declarations are supported:

       •   <u>generator_type</u> =&gt; '<u>method_name</u>'

       •   <u>generator_type</u> =&gt; '<u>name_1</u> <u>name_2</u>...'

       •   <u>generator_type</u> =&gt; [ '<u>name_1</u>', '<u>name_2</u>', ...]

       For    a    list    of    the    supported   values   of   <u>generator_type</u>,   see   "BASIC   CLASSES"   in
       Class::MakeMethods::Docs::Catalog, or the documentation for each subclass.

       For each method name you provide, a subroutine of the indicated type  will  be  generated  and  installed
       under that name in your module.

       Method names should start with a letter, followed by zero or more letters, numbers, or underscores.
