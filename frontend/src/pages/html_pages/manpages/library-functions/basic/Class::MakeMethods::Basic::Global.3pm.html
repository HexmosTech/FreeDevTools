</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::MakeMethods::Basic::Global - Basic shared methods

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Basic::Global (
           scalar =&gt; [ 'foo', 'bar' ],
           array =&gt; 'my_list',
           hash =&gt; 'my_index',
         );
         ....

         # Store and retrieve global values
         MyObject-&gt;foo('Foobar');
         print MyObject-&gt;foo();

         # All instances of your class access the same values
         $my_object-&gt;bar('Barbados');
         print $other_one-&gt;bar();

         # Array accessor
         MyObject-&gt;my_list(0 =&gt; 'Foozle', 1 =&gt; 'Bang!');
         print MyObject-&gt;<a href="../man1/my_list.1.html">my_list</a>(1);

         # Hash accessor
         MyObject-&gt;my_index('broccoli' =&gt; 'Blah!', 'foo' =&gt; 'Fiddle');
         print MyObject-&gt;my_index('foo');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Basic::Global subclass of MakeMethods provides basic accessors for data shared by an entire class,
       sometimes called "static" or "class data."

   <b>Calling</b> <b>Conventions</b>
       When you "use" this package, the method names you provide as arguments cause subroutines to be generated
       and installed in your module.

       See "Calling Conventions" in Class::MakeMethods::Basic for a summary, or "USAGE" in Class::MakeMethods
       for full details.

   <b>Declaration</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       To declare methods, pass in pairs of a method-type name followed by one or more method names. Valid
       method-type names for this package are listed in "METHOD GENERATOR TYPES".

       See "Declaration Syntax" in Class::MakeMethods::Basic for more syntax information.

</pre><h4><b>METHOD</b> <b>GENERATOR</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>scalar</b> <b>-</b> <b>Shared</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   May be called as a class method, or equivalently, on any object instance.

       •   Stores a global value accessible only through this method.

       •   If called without any arguments returns the current value.

       •   If called with an argument, stores that as the value, and returns it,

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Basic::Hash (
           scalar =&gt; 'foo',
         );
         ...

         # Store value
         MyObject-&gt;foo('Foozle');

         # Retrieve value
         print MyObject-&gt;foo;

   <b>array</b> <b>-</b> <b>Shared</b> <b>Ref</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   May be called as a class method, or equivalently, on any object instance.

       •   Stores a global value accessible only through this method.

       •   The value will be a reference to an array (or undef).

       •   If called without any arguments, returns the current array-ref value (or undef).

       •   If  called  with  one argument, uses that argument as an index to retrieve from the referenced array,
           and returns that value (or undef). If the single argument is an  array  ref,  then  a  slice  of  the
           referenced array is returned.

       •   If  called  with  a  list of index-value pairs, stores the value at the given index in the referenced
           array. If the value was previously undefined, a new array is autovivified. The current value in  each
           position  will  be  overwritten,  and later arguments with the same index will override earlier ones.
           Returns the current array-ref value.

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Basic::Hash (
           array =&gt; 'bar',
         );
         ...

         # Set values by position
         $obj-&gt;bar(0 =&gt; 'Foozle', 1 =&gt; 'Bang!');

         # Positions may be overwritten, and in any order
         $obj-&gt;bar(2 =&gt; 'And Mash', 1 =&gt; 'Blah!');

         # Retrieve value by position
         print $obj-&gt;<a href="../man1/bar.1.html">bar</a>(1);

         # Retrieve slice of values by position
         print join(', ', $obj-&gt;bar( [0, 2] ) );

         # Direct access to referenced array
         print scalar @{ $obj-&gt;bar() };

         # Reset the array contents to empty
         @{ $obj-&gt;bar() } = ();

   <b>hash</b> <b>-</b> <b>Shared</b> <b>Ref</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   May be called as a class method, or equivalently, on any object instance.

       •   Stores a global value accessible only through this method.

       •   The value will be a reference to a hash (or undef).

       •   If called without any arguments, returns the current hash-ref value (or undef).

       •   If called with one argument, uses that argument as an index to retrieve from the referenced hash, and
           returns that value (or undef). If the single argument is an array ref, then a slice of the referenced
           hash is returned.

       •   If called with a list of key-value pairs, stores the value under the  given  key  in  the  referenced
           hash. If the value was previously undefined, a new hash is autovivified. The current value under each
           key  will  be  overwritten, and later arguments with the same key will override earlier ones. Returns
           the current hash-ref value.

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Basic::Hash (
           hash =&gt; 'baz',
         );
         ...

         # Set values by key
         $obj-&gt;baz('foo' =&gt; 'Foozle', 'bar' =&gt; 'Bang!');

         # Values may be overwritten, and in any order
         $obj-&gt;baz('broccoli' =&gt; 'Blah!', 'foo' =&gt; 'Fiddle');

         # Retrieve value by key
         print $obj-&gt;baz('foo');

         # Retrieve slice of values by position
         print join(', ', $obj-&gt;baz( ['foo', 'bar'] ) );

         # Direct access to referenced hash
         print keys %{ $obj-&gt;baz() };

         # Reset the hash contents to empty
         @{ $obj-&gt;baz() } = ();
