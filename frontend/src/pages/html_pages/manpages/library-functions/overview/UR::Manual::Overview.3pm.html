       UR::Manual::Overview - UR from Ten Thousand Feet

</pre><h4><b>Perspective</b> <b>on</b> <b>Objects</b></h4><pre>
       Standard software languages provide a facility for making objects. Those objects have certain
       characteristics which are different with UR objects.

       A standard object in most languages:

       •   exists only as long as the program which created it has a reference to it

       •   requires that the developer manage organizing the object(s) into a structure to support any searching
           required

       •   handles persistence between processes explicitly, by saving or loading the object to external storage

       •   references other objects only if explicitly linked to those objects

       •   acts as a functional software device, but any meaning associated with the object is implied by how it
           is used

       Regular objects like those described above are the building blocks of most software.

       In  many cases, however, they are often used for a second, higher-level purpose: defining entities in the
       domain model of the problem area the software addresses. UR objects  are  tailored  to  represent  domain
       model entities well. In some sense, UR objects follow many of the design principles present in relational
       databases, and as such mapping to a database for UR objects is trivial, and can be done in complex ways.

       UR objects differ from a standard object in the following key ways:

       •   the object exists after creation until explicitly deleted, or the transaction it is in rolled-back

       •   managing  loaded  objects  is  done automatically by a Context object, which handles queries, saving,
           lazy-loading and caching

       •   it is possible to query for an object by specifying the class and the matching characteristics

       •   the object can reference other objects which are not loaded in the current process, and be referenced
           by objects not in the current process

       •   the object is a particular truth-assertion in the context in which it exists

</pre><h4><b>Object-Relational</b> <b>Mapping</b></h4><pre>
       UR's primary reason for existing is to function as an ORM. That is, managing how to  store  instances  of
       objects  in  memory  of  a  running  program  with  more persistent storage in a relational database, and
       retrieve them later.  It handles the common cases where each  table  is  implemented  by  a  class  their
       columns are properties of the classes; retrieving objects by arbitrary properties; creating, updating and
       deleting objects with enforced database constraints; and named relationships between classes.

       It can also handle more complicated things like:

       •   classes for things which are not database entities at all

       •   derived classes where the data spans multiple tables between the parent and child classes

       •   loading  an  object through a parent class and having it automatically reblessed into the appropriate
           subclass

       •   properties with no DB column behind them

       •   calculated properties with a formula behind them

       •   inheritance hierarchies that may have tables missing at some or all stages

       •   meta-data about Properties, Classes and the relationships between them

</pre><h4><b>Object</b> <b>Context</b></h4><pre>
       With UR, every object you create is made a part of the current "Context".  Conceptually, the  Context  is
       the  lens by which your application views the data that exists in the world.  At one level, you can think
       of the current context as an in-memory transaction. All changes to the object are tracked by the context.
       The Context knows how to map objects to their storage locations, called Data Sources. Saving your changes
       is simply a matter of asking the current context to commit.

       The Context can also reverse the saving process, and map a request for an object to a query  of  external
       storage. Requests for objects go through the Context, are loaded from outside as needed, and are returned
       to the caller after being made part of the current context's transaction.

       Objects  never  reference each other by actual Perl reference internally, instead they use the referent's
       ID. Accessors on an object which return another object send the ID through the context to get the  object
       back, allowing the context to load the referenced object only when it is actually needed. This means that
       your  objects  can  hook together until references span an entire database schema, and pulling one object
       from the database will not load the entire database into memory.

       The context handles caching, and by default will cache everything it touches. This means that you can ask
       for the same thing multiple times, and only the first request will actually hit the underlying  database.
       It  also  means that requests for objects which map to the same ID will return the exact same instance of
       the object.

       The net effect is that each process's context is an in-memory database. All  object  creation,  deletion,
       and  change is occurring directly to that database.  For objects configured to have external persistence,
       this database manages itself as a "diff" vs. the external database, allowing it to simulate  representing
       all UR data everywhere, while only actually tracking what is needed.

   <b>Benefits</b>
       •   database queries don't repeat themselves again and again

       •   you never write insert/update/delete statements, or work out constraint order yourself

       •   allows  you to write methods which address an object individually, with ways to avoid many individual
           database queries

       •   explicitly clearing the cache is less complex than explicitly managing the caching of data

   <b>Issues</b>
       •   the cache grows until you explicitly clear it

       •   there is CPU overhead checking the cache if you really are always going directly to the database

       Unloading objects from the cache can be done in several ways

       •   Calling <b>unload()</b> as a class or instance method to unload all objects of a class,  or  one  particular
           object.

       •   Setting     object     count     limits     explicitly    with    <b>object_cache_size_lowwater()</b>    and
           <b>object_cache_size_highwater()</b> in UR::Context

       •   Creating a UR::Context::AutoUnloadPool instance.  When it goes out of scope, all  UR  Objects  loaded
           during its lifetime will be unloaded.

</pre><h4><b>Class</b> <b>Definitions</b></h4><pre>
       At  the  top  of  every  module  implementing  a  UR  class  is a block of code that defines the class to
       explicitly spell out its inheritance, properties and types, constraints, relationships to  other  classes
       and where the persistent storage is located. It's meant to be easy to read and edit, if necessary. If the
       class is backed by a database table, then it can also maintain itself.

</pre><h4><b>Metadata</b></h4><pre>
       Besides  the  object  instances  representing  data  used by the program, the UR system has other objects
       representing metadata about the classes (class information,  properties,  relationships,  etc),  database
       entities  (databases,  tables,  columns,  constraints,  etc),  transactions,  data  sources, etc. All the
       metadata is accessible through the same API as any of the database-backed data.

       For classes backed by the database, after a schema change (like adding tables or columns, altering  types
       or  constraints),  a command-line tool can automatically detect the change and alter the class definition
       in the Perl module to keep the metadata in sync with the database.

</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b> <b>System</b></h4><pre>
       At the simplest level, most entities have a 'doc' metadata attribute to attach some kind of documentation
       to. There's also a set of tools that can be run from the command line  or  a  web  browser  to  view  the
       documentation.  It  can  also  be  used  to  browse through the class and database metadata, and generate
       diagrams about the metadata.

</pre><h4><b>Iterators</b></h4><pre>
       If a retrieval from the database is likely to result in the generation of tons of objects, you can choose
       to get them back in a list and keep them all in memory, or get back a special Iterator  object  that  the
       program can use to get back objects in batches.

</pre><h4><b>Command</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Tools</b></h4><pre>
       UR has a central command-line tool that cam be used to manipulate the metadata in different ways. Setting
       up namespaces, creating data sources, syncing classes with schemas, accessing documentation, etc.

       There  is  also  a framework for creating classes that represent command line tools, their parameters and
       results, and makes it easy to create tools through the Command Pattern.

</pre><h4><b>Example</b></h4><pre>
       Given these classes:

       PathThing/Path.pm
             use strict;
             use warnings;

             use PathThing;  # The application's UR::Namespace module

             class PathThing::Path {
                 id_by =&gt; 'path_id',
                 has =&gt; [
                     desc   =&gt; { is =&gt; 'String' },
                     length =&gt; { is =&gt; 'Integer' },
                 ],
                 data_source =&gt; 'PathThing::DataSource::TheDB',
                 table_name =&gt; 'PATHS',
             };

       PathThing/Node.pm
             class PathThing::Node {
                 id_by =&gt; 'node_id',
                 has =&gt; [
                     left_path =&gt; { is =&gt; 'PathThing::Path', id_by =&gt; 'left_path_id' },
                     left_path_desc =&gt; { via =&gt; 'left_path', to =&gt; 'desc' },
                     left_path_length =&gt; { via =&gt; 'left_path', to =&gt; 'length' },

                     right_path =&gt; { is =&gt; 'PathThing::Path', id_by =&gt; 'right_path_id' },
                     right_path_desc =&gt; { via =&gt; 'right_path', to =&gt; 'desc' },
                     right_path_length =&gt; { via =&gt; 'right_path', to =&gt; 'length' },

                     map_coord_x =&gt; { is =&gt; 'Integer' },
                     map_coord_y =&gt; { is =&gt; 'String' },
                 ],
                 data_source =&gt; 'PathThing::DataSource::TheDB',
                 table_name =&gt; 'NODES',
             };

       For a script like this one:

         use PathThing::Node;
         my @results = PathThing::Node-&gt;get(
                           right_path_desc =&gt; 'over the river',
                           left_path_desc =&gt; 'through the woods',
                           right_path_length =&gt; 10,
                       );

       It will generate SQL like this:

         select NODES.NODE_ID, NODES.LEFT_PATH_ID, NODES.RIGHT_PATH_ID,
                NODES.MAP_COORD_X, NODES.MAP_COORD_Y,
                left_path_1.PATH_ID, left_path_1.DESC, left_path_1.LENGTH
                right_path_1.PATH_ID, right_path_1.DESC, right_path_1.LENGTH
         from NODES
         join PATHS left_path_1 on NODES.LEFT_PATH_ID = left_path_1.PATH_ID
         join PATHS right_path_1 on NODES.RIGHT_PATH_ID = right_path1.PATH_ID
         where left_path_1.DESC = 'through the woods'
           and right_path_1.DESC = 'over the river',
           and right_path_1.LENGTH = 10

       And for every row returned by the query, a  PathThing::Node  and  two  PathThing::Path  objects  will  be
       instantiated and stored in the Context's cache.  @results will contain a list of matching PathThing::Node
       objects.
