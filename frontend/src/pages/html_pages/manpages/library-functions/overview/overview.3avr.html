       overview - Toolchain Overview

</pre><h4><b>Introduction</b></h4><pre>
       Welcome to the open source software development toolset for the Microchip (formerly Atmel) AVR!

       There is not a single tool that provides everything needed to develop software for the AVR. It takes many
       tools working together. Collectively, the group of tools are called a toolset, or commonly a toolchain,
       as the tools are chained together to produce the final executable application for the AVR
       microcontroller.

       The following sections provide an overview of all of these tools. You may be used to cross-compilers that
       provide everything with a GUI front-end, and not know what goes on 'underneath the hood'. You may be
       coming from a desktop or server computer background and not used to embedded systems. Or you may be just
       learning about the most common software development toolchain available on Unix and Linux systems.
       Hopefully the following overview will be helpful in putting everything in perspective.

</pre><h4><b>FSF</b> <b>and</b> <b>GNU</b></h4><pre>
       According to its website, 'the Free Software Foundation (FSF), established in 1985, is dedicated to
       promoting computer users' rights to use, study, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs. The FSF
       promotes the development and use of free software, particularly the GNU operating system, used widely in
       its GNU/Linux variant.' The FSF remains the primary sponsor of the GNU project.

       The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete Unix-like operating system which is free
       software: the GNU system. GNU is a recursive acronym for 'GNU's Not Unix'; it is pronounced guh-noo,
       approximately like canoe.

       One of the main projects of the GNU system is the GNU Compiler Collection, or GCC, and its sister
       project, GNU Binutils. These two open source projects provide a foundation for a software development
       toolchain. Note that these projects were designed to originally run on Unix-like systems.

</pre><h4><b>GCC</b></h4><pre>
       GCC stands for GNU Compiler Collection. GCC is highly flexible compiler system. It has different compiler
       front-ends for different languages. It has many back-ends that generate assembly code for many different
       processors and host operating systems. All share a common 'middle-end', containing the generic parts of
       the compiler, including a lot of optimizations.

       In GCC, a <u>host</u> system is the system (processor/OS) that the compiler runs on. A <u>target</u> system is the
       system that the compiler compiles code for. And, a <u>build</u> system is the system that the compiler is built
       (from source code) on. If a compiler has the same system for <u>host</u> and for <u>target</u>, it is known as a <u>native</u>
       compiler. If a compiler has different systems for <u>host</u> and <u>target</u>, it is known as a cross-compiler. (And
       if all three, <u>build</u>, <u>host</u>, and <u>target</u> systems are different, it is known as a Canadian cross compiler,
       but we won't discuss that here.) When GCC is built to execute on a <u>host</u> system such as FreeBSD, Linux, or
       Windows, and it is built to generate code for the AVR microcontroller <u>target</u>, then it is a cross
       compiler, and this version of GCC is commonly known as 'AVR GCC'. In documentation, or discussion, AVR
       GCC is used when referring to GCC targeting specifically the AVR, or something that is AVR specific about
       GCC. The term 'GCC' is usually used to refer to something generic about GCC, or about GCC as a whole.

       GCC is different from most other compilers. GCC focuses on translating a high-level language to the
       target assembly only. AVR GCC has three available compilers for the AVR: C language, C++, and Ada. The
       compiler itself does not assemble or link the final code.

       GCC is also known as a 'driver' program, in that it knows about, and drives other programs seamlessly to
       create the final output. The assembler, and the linker are part of another open source project called GNU
       Binutils. GCC knows how to drive the GNU assembler (gas) to assemble the output of the compiler. GCC
       knows how to drive the GNU linker (ld) to link all of the object modules into a final executable.

       The two projects, GCC and Binutils, are very much interrelated and many of the same volunteers work on
       both open source projects.

       When GCC is built for the AVR target, the actual program names are prefixed with 'avr-'. So the actual
       executable name for AVR GCC is: avr-gcc. The name 'avr-gcc' is used in documentation and discussion when
       referring to the program itself and not just the whole AVR GCC system.

       See the GCC Web Site and GCC User Manual for more information about GCC.

</pre><h4><b>GNU</b> <b>Binutils</b></h4><pre>
       The name GNU Binutils stands for 'Binary Utilities'. It contains the GNU assembler (gas), and the GNU
       linker (ld), but also contains many other utilities that work with binary files that are created as part
       of the software development toolchain.

       Again, when these tools are built for the AVR target, the actual program names are prefixed with 'avr-'.
       For example, the assembler program name, for a native assembler is 'as' (even though in documentation the
       GNU assembler is commonly referred to as 'gas'). But when built for an AVR target, it becomes 'avr-as'.
       Below is a list of the programs that are included in Binutils:

       <b>avr-as</b>
           The Assembler.

       <b>avr-ld</b>
           The Linker.

       <b>avr-ar</b>
           Create, modify, and extract from libraries (archives).

       <b>avr-ranlib</b>
           Generate index to library (archive) contents.

       <b>avr-objcopy</b>
           Copy and translate object files to different formats.

       <b>avr-objdump</b>
           Display information from object files including disassembly.

       <b>avr-size</b>
           List section sizes and total size.

       <b>avr-nm</b>
           List symbols from object files.

       <b>avr-strings</b>
           List printable strings from files.

       <b>avr-strip</b>
           Discard symbols from files.

       <b>avr-readelf</b>
           Display the contents of ELF format files.

       <b>avr-addr2line</b>
           Convert addresses to file and line.

       <b>avr-c++filt</b>
           Filter to demangle encoded C++ symbols.

</pre><h4><b>AVR-LibC</b></h4><pre>
       GCC and Binutils provides a lot of the tools to develop software, but there is one critical component
       that they do not provide: a Standard C Library.

       There are different open source projects that provide a Standard C Library depending upon your system
       time, whether for a native compiler (GNU Libc), for some other embedded system (Newlib), or for some
       versions of Linux (uCLibc). The open source AVR toolchain has its own Standard C Library project: AVR-
       LibC.

       AVR-LibC provides many of the same functions found in a regular Standard C Library and many additional
       library functions that is specific to an AVR. Some of the Standard C Library functions that are commonly
       used on a PC environment have limitations or additional issues that a user needs to be aware of when used
       on an embedded system.

       AVR-LibC also contains the most documentation about the whole AVR toolchain.

</pre><h4><b>Building</b> <b>Software</b></h4><pre>
       Even though GCC, Binutils, and AVR-LibC are the core projects that are used to build software for the
       AVR, there is another piece of software that ties it all together: Make. GNU Make is a program that makes
       things, and mainly software. Make interprets and executes a Makefile that is written for a project. A
       Makefile contains dependency rules, showing which output files are dependent upon which input files, and
       instructions on how to build output files from input files.

       Some distributions of the toolchains, and other AVR tools such as MFile, contain a Makefile template
       written for the AVR toolchain and AVR applications that you can copy and modify for your application.

       See the GNU Make User Manual for more information.

</pre><h4><b>AVRDUDE</b></h4><pre>
       After creating your software, you'll want to program your device. You can do this by using the program
       AVRDUDE which can interface with various hardware devices to program your processor.

       AVRDUDE is a very flexible package. All the information about AVR processors and various hardware
       programmers is stored in a text database. This database can be modified by any user to add new hardware
       or to add an AVR processor if it is not already listed.

</pre><h4><b>GDB</b> <b>/</b> <b>Insight</b> <b>/</b> <b>DDD</b></h4><pre>
       The GNU Debugger (GDB) is a command-line debugger that can be used with the rest of the AVR toolchain.
       Insight is GDB plus a GUI written in Tcl/Tk. Both GDB and Insight are configured for the AVR and the main
       executables are prefixed with the target name: avr-gdb, and avr-insight. There is also a 'text mode' GUI
       for GDB: avr-gdbtui. DDD (Data Display Debugger) is another popular GUI front end to GDB, available on
       Unix and Linux systems.

</pre><h4><b>AVaRICE</b></h4><pre>
       AVaRICE is a back-end program to AVR GDB and interfaces to the AVR JTAG In-Circuit Emulator (ICE), to
       provide emulation capabilities.

</pre><h4><b>SimulAVR</b></h4><pre>
       SimulAVR is an AVR simulator used as a back-end with AVR GDB.

</pre><h4><b>Utilities</b></h4><pre>
       There are also other optional utilities available that may be useful to add to your toolset.

       SRecord is a collection of powerful tools for manipulating EPROM load files. It reads and writes numerous
       EPROM file formats, and can perform many different manipulations.

       MFile is a simple Makefile generator is meant as an aid to quickly customize a Makefile to use for your
       AVR application.

</pre><h4><b>Toolchain</b> <b>Distributions</b> <b>(Distros)</b></h4><pre>
       All of the various open source projects that comprise the entire toolchain are normally distributed as
       source code. It is left up to the user to build the tool application from its source code. This can be a
       very daunting task to any potential user of these tools.

       Luckily there are people who help out in this area. Volunteers take the time to build the application
       from source code on particular host platforms and sometimes packaging the tools for convenient
       installation by the end user. These packages contain the binary executables of the tools, pre-made and
       ready to use. These packages are known as 'distributions' of the AVR toolchain, or by a more shortened
       name, 'distros'.

       AVR toolchain distros are available on FreeBSD, Windows, Mac OS X, and certain flavors of Linux.

</pre><h4><b>Open</b> <b>Source</b></h4><pre>
       All of these tools, from the original source code in the multitude of projects, to the various distros,
       are put together by many, many volunteers. All of these projects could always use more help from other
       people who are willing to volunteer some of their time. There are many different ways to help, for people
       with varying skill levels, abilities, and available time.

       You can help to answer questions in mailing lists such as the avr-gcc-list, or on forums at the AVR
       Freaks website. This helps many people new to the open source AVR tools.

       If you think you found a bug in any of the tools, it is always a big help to submit a good bug report to
       the proper project. A good bug report always helps other volunteers to analyze the problem and to get it
       fixed for future versions of the software.

       You can also help to fix bugs in various software projects, or to add desirable new features.

       Volunteers are always welcome! :-)
