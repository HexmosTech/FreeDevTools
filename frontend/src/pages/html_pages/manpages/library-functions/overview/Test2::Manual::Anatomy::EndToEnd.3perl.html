       Test2::Manual::EndToEnd - Overview of Test2 from load to finish.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a high level overview of everything from loading Test2 through the end of a test script.

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>HAPPENS</b> <b>WHEN</b> <b>I</b> <b>LOAD</b> <b>THE</b> <b>API?</b></h4><pre>
           use Test2::API qw/context/;

       A singleton instance of Test2::API::Instance is created.
           You have no access to this, it is an implementation detail.

       Several API functions are defined that use the singleton instance.
           You can import these functions, or use them directly.

       Then what?
           It waits...

           The  API  intentionally  does  as  little  as  possible. At this point something can still change the
           formatter, load Test2::IPC, or have other global effects that  need  to  be  done  before  the  first
           Test2::API::Context  is  created.  Once  the first Test2::API::Context is created the API will finish
           initialization.

           See "WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I ACQUIRE A CONTEXT?" for more information.

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>HAPPENS</b> <b>WHEN</b> <b>I</b> <b>USE</b> <b>A</b> <b>TOOL?</b></h4><pre>
       This section covers the basic workflow all tools such as ok() must follow.

           sub ok($$) {
               my ($bool, $name) = @_;

               my $ctx = context();

               my $event = $ctx-&gt;send_event('Ok', pass =&gt; $bool, name =&gt; $name);

               ...

               $ctx-&gt;release;
               return $bool;
           }

           ok(1, "1 is true");

       A tool function is run.
               ok(1, "1 is true");

       The tool acquires a context object.
               my $ctx = context();

           See "WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I ACQUIRE A CONTEXT?" for more information.

       The tool uses the context object to create, send, and return events.
           See "WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I SEND AN EVENT?" for more information.

               my $event = $ctx-&gt;send_event('Ok', pass =&gt; $bool, name =&gt; $name);

       When done the tool MUST release the context.
           See "WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I RELEASE A CONTEXT?" for more information.

               $ctx-&gt;release();

       The tool returns.
               return $bool;

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>HAPPENS</b> <b>WHEN</b> <b>I</b> <b>ACQUIRE</b> <b>A</b> <b>CONTEXT?</b></h4><pre>
           my $ctx = context();

       These actions may not happen exactly in this order,  but  that  is  an  implementation  detail.  For  the
       purposes of this document this order is used to help the reader understand the flow.

       $!, $@, $? and $^E are captured and preserved.
           Test2  makes  a  point  to  preserve the values of $!, $@, $? and $^E such that the test tools do not
           modify these variables unexpectedly. They are captured first thing  so  that  they  can  be  restored
           later.

       The API state is changed to 'loaded'.
           The  'loaded'  state  means  that  test tools have already started running. This is important as some
           plugins need to take effect before any tests are run. This state change only happens the first time a
           context is acquired, and may trigger some hooks defined by plugins to run.

       The current hub is found.
           A context attaches itself to the current Test2::Hub. If there is no current hub  then  the  root  hub
           will be initialized. This will also initialize the hub stack if necessary.

       Context acquire hooks fire.
           It  is  possible  to  create  global, or hub-specific hooks that fire whenever a context is acquired,
           these hooks will fire now. These hooks fire even if there is an existing context.

       Any existing context is found.
           If the current hub already has a context then a clone of it will be used instead of a completely  new
           context.  This  is  important  because  it  allows nested tools to inherit the context used by parent
           tools.

       Stack depth is measured.
           Test2 makes a point to catch mistakes in how the  context  is  used.  The  stack  depth  is  used  to
           accomplish  this.  If  there  is  an existing context the depth will be checked against the one found
           here. If the old context has the same stack depth, or a shallower one, it means a tool is misbehaving
           and did not clean up the context when it was done, in which case the old context will be cleaned  up,
           and a warning issued.

       A new context is created (if no existing context was found)
           If there is no existing context, a new one will be created using the data collected so far.

       Context init hooks fire (if no existing context was found)
           If a new context was created, context-creation hooks will fire.

       $!, $@, $?, and $^E are restored.
           We  make sure $!, $@, $?, and $^E are unchanged at this point so that changes we made will not effect
           anything else. This is done in case something inside the context  construction  accidentally  changed
           these vars.

       The context is returned.
           You have a shiney new context object, or a clone of the existing context.

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>HAPPENS</b> <b>WHEN</b> <b>I</b> <b>SEND</b> <b>AN</b> <b>EVENT?</b></h4><pre>
           my $event = $ctx-&gt;send_event('Ok', pass =&gt; $bool, name =&gt; $name);

       The Test2::Event::Ok module is loaded.
           The  send_event()  method will automatically load any Event package necessary.  Normally send_event()
           will assume the first argument is an event class without the "Test2::Event::" prefix, which  it  will
           add  for  you.  If you want to use an event class that is in a different namespace you can prefix the
           class name with a "+" to tell the tool that you are giving a fully qualified class name:

               my $event = $ctx-&gt;send_event('+Fully::Qualified::Event', pass =&gt; $bool, name =&gt; $name);

       A new instance of Test2::Event::Ok is created.
           The event object is instantiated using the provided parameters.

       The event object is sent to the hub.
           The hub takes over from here.

       The hub runs the event through any filters.
           Filters are able to modify or remove events. Filters are run  first,  before  the  event  can  modify
           global test state.

       The global test state is updated to reflect the event.
           If  the event effects test count then the count will be incremented. If the event causes failure then
           the failure count will be incremented. There are a couple other ways the global state can be effected
           as well.

       The event is sent to the formatter
           After the state is changed the hub will send the event to the formatter for rendering. This is  where
           TAP is normally produced.

       The event is sent to all listeners.
           There can be any number of listeners that take action when events are processed, this happens now.

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>HAPPENS</b> <b>WHEN</b> <b>I</b> <b>RELEASE</b> <b>A</b> <b>CONTEXT?</b></h4><pre>
           $ctx-&gt;release;

       The current context clone is released.
           If  your  tool  is nested inside another, then releasing will simply destroy the copy of the context,
           nothing else will happen.

       If this was the canonical context, it will actually release
           When a context is created it is considered 'canon'. Any context obtained by a  nested  tool  will  be
           considered  a  child  context  linked  to  the  canonical  one.  Releasing child contexts does not do
           anything of note (but is still required).

       Release hooks are called
           Release hooks are the main motivation behind making the release() method, and making  it  a  required
           action  on  the  part of test tools. These are hooks that we can have called when a tool is complete.
           This is how plugins like Test2::Plugin::DieOnFail are implemented. If we simply had a destructor call
           the hooks then we would be unable to write this plugin as a "die" inside of a destructor is useless.

       The context is cleared
           The main context data is cleared allowing the next tool to create a new context. This is important as
           the next tool very likely has a new line number.

       $!, $@, $?, and $^E are restored
           When a Test2 tool is complete it will restore $@, $!, $? and $^E to avoid action at a distance.

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>HAPPENS</b> <b>WHEN</b> <b>I</b> <b>USE</b> <b>done_testing()?</b></h4><pre>
           done_testing();

       Any pending IPC events will be culled.
           If IPC is turned on, a final culling will take place.

       Follow-up hooks are run
           The follow-up hooks are a way to run actions when a hub  is  complete.  This  is  useful  for  adding
           cleanup tasks, or final tests to the end of a test.

       The final plan event is generated and processed.
           The final plan event will be produced using the current test count as the number of tests planned.

       The current hub is finalized.
           This will mark the hub is complete, and will not allow new events to be processed.

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>HAPPENS</b> <b>WHEN</b> <b>A</b> <b>TEST</b> <b>SCRIPT</b> <b>IS</b> <b>DONE?</b></h4><pre>
       Test2  has  some behaviors it runs in an "END { ... }" block after tests are done running. This end block
       does some final checks to warn you if something went wrong. This end block also sets the  exit  value  of
       the script.

       API Versions are checked.
           A  warning  will  be  produced  if  Test::Builder  is loaded, but has a different version compared to
           Test2::API. This situation can happen if you downgrade to an older Test-Simple distribution, and is a
           bad situation.

       Any remaining context objects are cleaned up.
           If there are leftover context objects they will need to be cleaned up. A leftover context is never  a
           good  thing,  and  usually  requires  a  warning.  A  leftover context could also be the result of an
           exception being thrown which terminates the script, Test2 is fairly good at  noticing  this  and  not
           warning in these cases as the warning would simply be noise.

       Child processes are sent a 'waiting' event.
           If IPC is active, a waiting event is sent to all child processes.

       The script will wait for all child processes and/or threads to complete.
           This  happens  only  when IPC is loaded, but Test::Builder is not. This behavior is useful, but would
           break compatibility for legacy tests.

       The hub stack is cleaned up.
           All hubs are finalized starting from the top. Leftover hubs are usually a bad thing, so a warning  is
           produced if any are found.

       The root hub is finalized.
           This step is a no-op if done_testing() was used. If needed this will mark the root hub as finished.

       Exit callbacks are called.
           This is a chance for plugins to modify the final exit value of the script.

       The scripts exit value ($?) is set.
           If  the  test encountered any failures this will be set to a non-zero value. If possible this will be
           set to the number of failures, or 255 if the number is larger than 255 (the max value allowed).

       Broken module diagnostics
           Test2 is aware of many modules which were broken by Test2's release. At this point  the  script  will
           check if any known-broken modules were loaded, and warn you if they were.

           <b>Note:</b>  This  only  happens  if  there were test failures. No broken module warnings are produced on a
           success.
