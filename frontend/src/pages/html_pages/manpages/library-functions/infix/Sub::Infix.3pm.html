       Sub::Infix - create a fake infix operator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use Sub::Infix;

          # Operator needs to be defined (or imported) at compile time.
          BEGIN { *plus = infix { $_[0] + $_[1] } };

          my $five = 2 |plus| 3;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sub::Infix creates fake infix operators using overloading. It doesn't use source filters, or
       Devel::Declare, or any of that magic. (Though Devel::Declare isn't magic enough to define infix operators
       anyway; I know; I've tried.) It's pure Perl, has no non-core dependencies, and runs on Perl 5.6.

       The price you pay for its simplicity is that you cannot define an operator that can be used like this:

          my $five = 2 plus 3;

       Instead, the operator needs to be wrapped with real Perl operators in one of three ways:

          my $five = 2 |plus| 3;
          my $five = 2 /plus/ 3;
          my $five = 2 &lt;&lt;plus&gt;&gt; 3;

       The advantage of this is that it gives you three different levels of operator precedence.

       You can also call the function a slightly less weird way:

          my $five = plus-&gt;(2, 3);

   <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>work?</b>
       "2 |plus| 3" is parsed by perl as: "2 | ( &amp;plus() | 3 )".

       &amp;plus() returns an object that overloads the "|" operator; let's call that $obj.

       The overloaded "$obj | 3" operation stashes 3 inside $obj noting that the number is the right operand,
       and returns $obj.

       Then "2 | $obj" is evaluated, stashing 2 inside $obj as the left operand. At this point, the object
       notices that it has both operands, and calls the coderef from the definition of the operator, passing it
       both operands.
