</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Authen::Captcha - Perl extension for creating captcha's to verify the human element in transactions.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Authen::Captcha;

         # create a new object
         my $captcha = Authen::Captcha-&gt;new();

         # set the data_folder. contains flatfile db to maintain state
         $captcha-&gt;data_folder('/some/folder');

         # set directory to hold publicly accessible images
         $captcha-&gt;output_folder('/some/http/folder');

         # Alternitively, any of the methods to set variables may also be
         # used directly in the constructor

         my $captcha = Authen::Captcha-&gt;new(
           data_folder =&gt; '/some/folder',
           output_folder =&gt; '/some/http/folder',
           );

         # create a captcha. Image filename is "$token.png"
         my $token = $captcha-&gt;generate_code($number_of_characters);

         # check for a valid submitted captcha
         #   $code is the submitted letter combination guess from the user
         #   $token is the submitted token from the user (that we gave them)
         my $results = $captcha-&gt;check_code($code,$token);
         # $results will be one of:
         #          1 : Passed
         #          0 : Code not checked (file error)
         #         -1 : Failed: code expired
         #         -2 : Failed: invalid code (not in database)
         #         -3 : Failed: invalid code (code does not match token)
         ##############

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       The captcha produced by this module is rather weak compared to other modules available. You are advised
       to update to GD::SecurityImage, which provides API-compatible interface in GD::SecurityImage::AC module.

</pre><h4><b>ABSTRACT</b></h4><pre>
       Authen::Captcha provides an object oriented interface to captcha file creations.  Captcha stands for
       Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. A Captcha is a program that
       can generate and grade tests that:

           - most humans can pass.
           - current computer programs can't pass

       The most common form is an image file containing distorted text, which humans are adept at reading, and
       computers (generally) do a poor job.  This module currently implements that method. We plan to add other
       methods, such as distorted sound files, and plain text riddles.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIRES</b></h4><pre>
           GD          (see <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~lds/GD-2.11/">http://search.cpan.org/~lds/GD-2.11/</a>)
           Digest::MD5 (standard perl module)

       In most common situations, you'll also want to have:

        A web server (untested on windows, but it should work)
        cgi-bin or mod-perl access
        Perl: Perl 5.00503 or later must be installed on the web server.
        GD.pm (with PNG support)

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       Download the zipped tar file from:

           <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search">http://search.cpan.org/search</a>?dist=Authen-Captcha

       Unzip the module as follows or use winzip:

           tar -zxvf Authen-Captcha-1.xxx.tar.gz

       The module can be installed using the standard Perl procedure:

           perl Makefile.PL
           make
           make test
           make install    # you need to be root

       Windows users without a working "make" can get nmake from:

           <a href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe</a>

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>MAIN</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       "$captcha = Authen::Captcha-&gt;new();"
           This  creates  a  new  Captcha  object.   Optionally,  you  can  pass  in  a  hash with configuration
           information.  See the method descriptions for more detail on what they mean.

              data_folder =&gt; '/some/folder', # required
              output_folder =&gt; '/some/http/folder', # required
              expire =&gt; 300, # optional. default 300
              width =&gt;  25, # optional. default 25
              height =&gt; 35, # optional. default 35
              images_folder =&gt; '/some/folder', # optional. default to lib dir
              keep_failures =&gt; 0, # optional, defaults to 0(false)
              debug =&gt; 0, # optional. default 0

       "$token = $captcha-&gt;generate_code( $number_of_characters );"
           Creates a captcha. Image filename is "$token.png"

           It can also be called in array context to retrieve the string of  characters  used  to  generate  the
           captcha (the string the user is expected to respond with). This is useful for debugging.  ex.

           "($token,$chars) = $captcha-&gt;generate_code( $number_of_characters );"

       "$results = $captcha-&gt;check_code($code,$token);"
           check for a valid submitted captcha

           $code is the submitted letter combination guess from the user

           $token is the submitted token from the user (that we gave them)

           If the $code and $token are correct, the image file and database entry will be removed.

           If the $token matches one in the database, and "keep_failures" is false (the default), the image file
           and database entry will be removed to avoid repeated attempts on the same captcha.

           $results will be one of:

               1 : Passed
               0 : Code not checked (file error)
              -1 : Failed: code expired
              -2 : Failed: invalid code (not in database)
              -3 : Failed: invalid code (code does not match token)

   <b>ACCESSOR</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       "$captcha-&gt;data_folder( '/some/folder' );"
           Required.  Sets  the  directory  to hold the flatfile database that will be used to store the current
           non-expired valid captcha tokens.  Must be writable by the process running the  script  (usually  the
           web server user, which is usually either "apache" or "http"), but should not be accessible to the end
           user.

       "$captcha-&gt;output_folder( '/some/folder' );"
           Required.  Sets  the  directory  to  hold  the  generated  Captcha image files. This is usually a web
           accessible directory so that the user can view the images in here, but it  doesn't  have  to  be  web
           accessible  (you  could  be  attaching  the  images to an e-mail for some verification, or some other
           Captcha implementation).  Must be writable by the process running the script (usually the web  server
           user, which is usually either "apache" or "http").

       "$captcha-&gt;images_folder( '/some/folder' );"
           Optional,  and may greatly affect the results... use with caution. Allows you to override the default
           character graphic png's and backgrounds with your  own  set  of  graphics.  These  are  used  in  the
           generation of the final captcha image file. The defaults are held in:
               [lib install dir]/Authen/Captcha/images

       "$captcha-&gt;expire( 300 );"
           Optional.  Sets  the  number  of  seconds this captcha will remain valid. This means that the created
           captcha's will not remain valid forever, just as long as you want  them  to  be  active.  Set  to  an
           appropriate value for your application. Defaults to 300.

       "$captcha-&gt;width( 25 );"
           Optional. Number of pixels high for the character graphics. Defaults to 25.

       "$captcha-&gt;height( 35 );"
           Optional. Number of pixels wide for the character graphics. Defaults to 35.

       "$captcha-&gt;keep_failures( [0|1] );"
           Optional. Defaults to zero. This option controls whether or not the captcha will remain valid after a
           failed  attempt.  By  default,  we  only  allow  one  attempt  to  solve it. This greatly reduces the
           possibility that a bot could brute force a correct answer. Change it at your own risk.

       "$captcha-&gt;debug( [0|1|2] );"
           Optional.  Sets the debugging bit. 1 turns it on, 0 turns it off. 2 will print out  verbose  messages
           to STDERR.
