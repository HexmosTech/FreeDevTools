       Date::Simple - a simple date object

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Date::Simple ('date', 'today');

           # Difference in days between two dates:
           $diff = date('2001-08-27') - date('1977-10-05');

           # Offset $n days from now:
           $date = today() + $n;
           print "$date\n";  # uses ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)

               print "Today is New Year's Eve!\n";
           }

           if ($today &gt; $tomorrow) {
               die "warp in space-time continuum";
           }

           print "Today is ";
           print(('Sun','Mon','Tues','Wednes','Thurs','Fri','Satur')

           # you can also do this:
           ($date cmp "2001-07-01")
           # and this
           ($date &lt;=&gt; [2001, 7, 1])

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Dates are complex enough without times and timezones.  This module may be used to create simple date
       objects.  It handles:

       Validation.
           Reject 1999-02-29 but accept 2000-02-29.

       Interval arithmetic.
           How many days were between two given dates?  What date comes N days after today?

       Day-of-week calculation.
           What day of the week is a given date?

       Transparent date formatting.
           How should a date object be formatted.

       It does <b>not</b> deal with hours, minutes, seconds, and time zones.

       A date is uniquely identified by year, month, and day integers within valid ranges.  This module will not
       allow the creation of objects for invalid dates.  Attempting to create an invalid date will return undef.
       Month numbering starts at 1 for January, unlike in C and Java.  Years are 4-digit.

       Gregorian dates up to year 9999 are handled correctly, but we rely on Perl's builtin "localtime" function
       when  the  current date is requested.  On some platforms, "localtime" may be vulnerable to rollovers such
       as the Unix "time_t" wraparound of 18 January 2038.

       Overloading is used so you can compare or subtract two dates using standard  numeric  operators  such  as
       "==", and the sum of a date object and an integer is another date object.

       Date::Simple  objects  are  immutable.   After assigning $date1 to $date2, no change to $date1 can affect
       $date2.  This means, for example, that there is  nothing  like  a  "set_year"  operation,  and  "$date++"
       assigns a new object to $date.

       This  module contains various undocumented functions.  They may not be available on all platforms and are
       likely to change or disappear in future releases.  Please let the author know if you think  any  of  them
       should be public.

   <b>Controlling</b> <b>output</b> <b>format.</b>
       As  of  version 3.0 new ways of controlling the output formats of Date::Simple objects has been provided.
       However Date::Simple has traditionally provided few ways  of  stringification,  a  primary  one  via  the
       <b>format()</b>  method  and  another  primary  one  via  direct stringification. However the later is currently
       implemented as an XS routine and the former is implemented through a perl routine.  This means that using
       <b>format()</b> is more expensive than stringification and that the stringification format is class specific.

       In order to alleviate some of these problems a new mechanism has been  introduced  to  Date::Simple  that
       allows  for  a  per object level format default. In addition a set of utility classes that have different
       stringification overloads provided.  These classes are simple subclasses of Date::Simple and  beside  the
       default  <b>format()</b> and the overloaded stringification behaviour are identical to Date::Simple. In fact one
       is totally identical to Date::Simple and is provided mostly for completeness.

       The classes included are:

       Date::Simple::ISO
           Identical to Date::Simple in every respect but name.

       Date::Simple::D8
           Uses the D8 format (%Y%m%d)  as  the  default  format  for  printing.  Uses  XS  for  the  overloaded
           stringification.

       Date::Simple::Fmt
           Uses  the  perl  implemented <b>format()</b> as the default stringification mechanism. The first argument to
           the constructor is expected to be the format to use for the object.

       <b>NOTE</b> its important to remember that the primary difference  between  the  behaviour  of  objects  of  the
       different  classes  is how they are stringified when quoted, and what date format is used by default when
       the <b>format()</b> method is called. Nothing else differs.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTORS</b></h4><pre>
       Several functions take a string or numeric representation and generate a corresponding date object.   The
       most  general is "new", whose argument list may be empty (returning the current date), a string in format
       YYYY-MM-DD or YYYYMMDD, a list or arrayref of year, month, and day number, or an existing date object.

       Date::Simple-&gt;new ([ARG, ...])
       date ([ARG, ...])
               my $date = Date::Simple-&gt;new('1972-01-17');

           The "new" method will return a date object if the values  passed  in  specify  a  valid  date.   (See
           above.)   If an invalid date is passed, the method returns undef.  If the argument is invalid in form
           as opposed to numeric range, "new" dies.

           The  "date"  function  provides  the  same  functionality  but  must  be  imported  or  qualified  as
           "Date::Simple::date".   (To  import  all  public  functions,  do "use Date::Simple (':all');".)  This
           function returns undef on all invalid input, rather than dying in some cases like "new".

       date_fmt (FMT,[ARG, ...])
           Equivelent to "date" but creates a Date::Simple::Fmt object instead. The format is expected to  be  a
           valid POSIX::strftime format string.

       date_iso ([ARG, ...])
           Identical to "date" but creates a Date::Simple::ISO object instead.

       date_d8 ([ARG, ...])
           Equivelent to "date" but creates a Date::Simple::D8 object instead.

       <b>today()</b>
           Returns the current date according to "localtime".

           <b>Caution:</b>  To  get  tomorrow's  date  (or  any fixed offset from today), do not use "today + 1".  Perl
           parses this as today(+1).  You need to put empty parentheses after the function: "today() + 1".

       ymd (YEAR, MONTH, DAY)
           Returns a date object with the given year, month, and day numbers.  If the arguments do not specify a
           valid date, undef is returned.

           Example:

               use Date::Simple ('ymd');
               $pbd = ymd(1987, 12, 18);

       d8 (STRING)
           Parses STRING as "YYYYMMDD" and returns the corresponding date object, or undef  if  STRING  has  the
           wrong format or specifies an invalid date.

           Example:

               use Date::Simple ('d8');
               $doi = d8('17760704');

           Mnemonic: The string matches "/\d{8}/".  Also, "d8" spells "date", if 8 is expanded phonetically.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       DATE-&gt;next
               my $tomorrow = $today-&gt;next;

           Returns an object representing tomorrow.

       DATE-&gt;prev
              my $yesterday = $today-&gt;prev;

           Returns an object representing yesterday.

       DATE-&gt;year
               my $year  = $date-&gt;year;

           Return the year of DATE as an integer.

       DATE-&gt;month
               my $month = $date-&gt;month;

           Return the month of DATE as an integer from 1 to 12.

       DATE-&gt;day
               my $day   = $date-&gt;day;

           Return the DATE's day of the month as an integer from 1 to 31.

       DATE-&gt;day_of_week
           Return a number representing DATE's day of the week from 0 to 6, where 0 means Sunday.

       DATE-&gt;as_ymd
               my ($year, $month, $day) = $date-&gt;as_ymd;

           Returns a list of three numbers: year, month, and day.

       DATE-&gt;as_d8
           Returns the "d8" representation (see "d8"), like "$date-&gt;format("%Y%m%d")".

       DATE-&gt;as_iso
           Returns  the ISO 8601 representation of the date (eg '2004-01-01'), like "$date-&gt;format("%Y-%m-%d")".
           This is in fact the default overloaded stringification mechanism and  is  provided  mostly  so  other
           subclasses with different overloading can still do fast ISO style date output.

       DATE-&gt;as_str ([STRING])
       DATE-&gt;format ([STRING])
       DATE-&gt;strftime ([STRING])
           These  functions are equivalent.  Return a string representing the date, in the format specified.  If
           you don't pass a parameter, the default date format for the object is used if one has been specified,
           otherwise uses the default date format for the class the object is a member of, or as a last fallback
           uses the $Date::Simple::Standard_Format which is changeable, but probably shouldn't be modified.  See
           "default_format" for details.

               my $change_date = $date-&gt;format("%d %b %y");
               my $iso_date1 = $date-&gt;format("%Y-%m-%d");
               my $iso_date2 = $date-&gt;format;

           The  formatting  parameter  is  similar  to  one  you  would pass to <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3).  This is because we
           actually do pass it to strftime to format the date.  This may result  in  differing  behavior  across
           platforms and locales and may not even work everywhere.

       DATE-&gt;default_format ([FORMAT])
           This method sets or gets the default_format for the DATE object or class that it is called on.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATORS</b></h4><pre>
       Some  operators  can be used with Date::Simple instances.  If one side of an expression is a date object,
       and the operator expects two date objects, the other side  is  interpreted  as  date(ARG),  so  an  array
       reference or ISO 8601 string will work.

       DATE + NUMBER
       DATE - NUMBER
           You can construct a new date offset by a number of days using the "+" and "-" operators.

       DATE1 - DATE2
           You can subtract two dates to find the number of days between them.

       DATE1 == DATE2
       DATE1 &lt; DATE2
       DATE1 &lt;=&gt; DATE2
       DATE1 cmp DATE2
       etc.
           You  can compare two dates using the arithmetic or string comparison operators.  Equality tests ("=="
           and "eq") return false when one of the expressions can not be converted to a date.  Other  comparison
           tests  die  in such cases.  This is intentional, because in a sense, all non-dates are not "equal" to
           all dates, but in no sense are they "greater" or "less" than dates.

       DATE += NUMBER
       DATE -= NUMBER
           You can increment or decrement a date by a number of days  using  the  +=  and  -=  operators.   This
           actually generates a new date object and is equivalent to "$date = $date + $number".

       "$date"
           You  can interpolate a date instance directly into a string, in the format specified by ISO 8601 (eg:
           2000-01-17) for Date::Simple and Date::Simple::ISO, for Date::Simple::D8 this is the same as  calling
           <b>as_d8()</b> on the object, and for Date::Simple::Fmt this is the same as calling <b>format()</b> on the object.

</pre><h4><b>UTILITIES</b></h4><pre>
