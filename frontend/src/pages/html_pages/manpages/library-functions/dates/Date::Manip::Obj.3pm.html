</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Date::Manip::Obj - Base class for Date::Manip objects

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The Date::Manip::Obj class is the base class used for the following Date::Manip classes:

       Date::Manip::Base
       Date::Manip::TZ
       Date::Manip::Date
       Date::Manip::Delta
       Date::Manip::Recur

       This module is not intended to be called directly and performs no useful function by itself. Instead, use
       the various derived classes which inherit from it.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module contains a set of methods used by all Date::Manip classes listed above.

       You should be familiar with the Date::Manip::Objects and Date::Manip::Config documentation.

       In the method descriptions below, Date::Manip::Date objects will usually be used as examples, but (unless
       otherwise stated), all of the classes listed above have the same methods, and work in the same fashion.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CREATING</b> <b>OBJECTS</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  examples  below,  any  variable  named some variation of $date ($date, $date1, $date2, ...) is a
       Date::Manip::Date object. Similarly, $delta, $recur, $tz, and $base refer to objects in  the  appropriate
       class.

       Any $obj variable refers to an object in any of the classes.

       <b>new</b> There are two ways to use the new method. They are:

              $obj2  = new CLASS ($obj1,$string,@parse_opts,\@opts);
              $obj2  = $obj1-&gt;new($string,@parse_opts,\@opts)

           In both cases, all arguments are optional.

           Both methods are used to create a new object of a given class.  In the first case, <b>CLASS</b> is the class
           of the new object. For example:

              $date  = new Date::Manip::Date;
              $delta = new Date::Manip::Delta;

           In  the  second  method,  the  class  of  the  new object will be derived from the first object.  For
           example:

              $date1 = new Date::Manip::Date;
              $date2 = $date1-&gt;new();

           the class of the second object ($date2) is Date::Manip::Date because that is the class of the  object
           ($date1) used to create it.

           In both first method (when a $obj1 is passed in) and always in the second method, the new object will
           share as much information from the old object ($obj1) as possible.

           For example, if you call either of these:

              $date2 = new Date::Manip::Date $date1;
              $date2 = $date1-&gt;new();

           the new date object will use the same embedded Date::Manip::TZ and Date::Manip::Base objects.

           When  specifying CLASS and including an old object, objects do not need to be of the same class.  For
           example, the following are all valid:

              $date = new Date::Manip::Date $delta;
              $date = new Date::Manip::Date $tz;

           You can even do:

              $date = new Date::Manip::Date $base;

           but this will have to create a completely  new  Date::Manip::TZ  object,  which  means  that  optimal
           performance may not be achieved if a Date::Manip::TZ object already exists.

           There  are  two special cases. Either of the following will create a new Date::Manip::Base object for
           handling multiple configurations:

              $base2 = new Date::Manip::Base $base1;
              $base2 = $base1-&gt;new();

           Either of the following will create a new Date::Manip::TZ  object  with  the  same  Date::Manip::Base
           object embedded in it:

              $tz2   = new Date::Manip::TZ $tz1;
              $tz2   = $tz1-&gt;new();

           The  new  base  object  will  initially  have the same configuration as the original base object, but
           changing it's configuration will not affect the original base object.

           If the "\@opts" argument is passed in, it is a list reference containing a list suitable for  passing
           to  the  <b>config</b>  method  (described below). In this case, a new Date::Manip::Base object (and perhaps
           Date::Manip::TZ object) will be created. The new Base object will start as identical to the  original
           one (if a previously defined object was used to create the new object) with the additional options in
           @opts added.

           In other words, the following are equivalent:

              $date  = new Date::Manip::Date $obj,\@opts;

              $base  = $obj-&gt;base();
              $base2 = $base-&gt;new();
              $date = new Date::Manip::Date $base2;
              $date-&gt;config(@opts);

           It should be noted that the options are applied to the NEW Date::Manip::Base object, not the old one.

           An  optional  string  ($string  and  parse  opts  @parse_opts)  may be passed in only when creating a
           Date::Manip::Date, Date::Manip::Delta, or Date::Manip::Recur object.  If passed in  when  creating  a
           Date::Manip::TZ or Date::Manip::Base object, a warning will be issued, but execution will continue.

           If  the  string is included, it will be parsed to give an initial value to the object. This will only
           be done AFTER any options are handled, so the following are equivalent:

              $date = new Date::Manip::Date $string,@parse_opts,\@opts;

              $date = new Date::Manip::Date;
              $date-&gt;config(@opts);
              $date-&gt;parse($string,@parse_opts);

           Once a Date::Manip::Date object (or any object in any other Date::Manip class) is created, it  should
           always  be used to create additional objects in order to preserve cached data for optimal performance
           and memory usage.

           The  one  caveat  is  if  you  are  working  with  multiple  configurations  as  described   in   the
           Date::Manip::Objects  document.  In that case, you may need to create completely new objects to allow
           multiple Date::Manip::Base objects to be used.

       <b>new_config</b>
              $obj2 = $obj1-&gt;new_config($string,\@opts);

           This creates a new instance with a new Date::Manip::Base object (and possibly a  new  Date::Manip::TZ
           object).

           For example,

              $date2 = $date1-&gt;new_config();

           creates  a  new  Date::Manip::Date  object with a new Date::Manip::TZ (and Date::Manip::Base) object.
           Initially, it is the same configuration as the original object.

           If the object is a Date::Manip::Base object, the following are equivalent:

              $base2 = $base1-&gt;new_config();

              $base2 = $base1-&gt;new();

           Both $string and "\@opts" are optional. They are used in the same  way  they  are  used  in  the  new
           method.

       <b>new_date</b>
       <b>new_delta</b>
       <b>new_recur</b>
           These are shortcuts for specifying the class. The following sets of calls are all equivalent:

              $date  = $obj-&gt;new_date();
              $date  = new Date::Manip::Date($obj);

              $delta = $obj-&gt;new_delta();
              $delta = new Date::Manip::Date($obj);

           These methods all allow optional "($string,\@opts)" arguments.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>base</b>
       <b>tz</b>
              $base = $obj-&gt;base();

           This returns the Date::Manip::Base object associated with the given object.

           If  $obj is a Date::Manip::Base object, nothing is returned (i.e. it doesn't create a new copy of the
           object).

              $tz = $obj-&gt;tz();

           This  returns  the  Date::Manip::TZ  object  associated  with  the  given  object.  If  $obj   is   a
           Date::Manip::TZ or Date::Manip::Base object, nothing is returned.

       <b>config</b>
              $obj-&gt;config($var1,$val1,$var2,$val2,...);

           This  will  set  the  value  of  any configuration variables. Please refer to the Date::Manip::Config
           manual for a list of all configuration variables and their description.

       <b>get_config</b>
              @var = $obj-&gt;get_config();
              $val = $obj-&gt;get_config($var1);
              @val = $obj-&gt;get_config($var1,$var2,...);

           This queries the current config values.  With  no  argument,  it  will  return  the  list  of  config
           variables (all lowercase).

           With  one  or  more arguments, it returns the current values for the config variables passed in (case
           insensitive).

       <b>err</b>
              $err = $obj-&gt;err();

           This will return the full error message if the previous operation failed for any reason.

              $obj-&gt;<a href="../man1/err.1.html">err</a>(1);

           will clear the error code.

       <b>is_date</b>
       <b>is_delta</b>
       <b>is_recur</b>
              $flag = $obj-&gt;is_date();

           Returns 0 or 1, depending on the object. For example, a Date::Manip::Date object returns 1  with  the
           is_date method, and 0 for the other two.

       <b>version</b>
              $vers = $obj-&gt;version($flag);

           This returns the version of Date::Manip.

           If  $flag  is  passed  in,  and  $obj  is  not  a  Date::Manip::Base object, the version and timezone
           information will be passed back.
