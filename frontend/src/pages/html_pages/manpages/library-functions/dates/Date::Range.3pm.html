       Date::Range - work with a range of dates

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Date::Range;

         my $range = Date::Range-&gt;new($date1, $date2);

         my $earliest = $range-&gt;start;
         my $latest   = $range-&gt;end;
         my $days     = $range-&gt;length;

         if ($range-&gt;includes($date3)) { ... }
         if ($range-&gt;includes($range2)) { ... }

         if ($range-&gt;overlaps($range2)) {
           my $range3 = $range-&gt;overlap($range2);
         }

         foreach my $date ($range-&gt;dates) { ... }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Quite often, when dealing with dates, we don't just want to know information about one particular date,
       but about a range of dates. For example, we may wish to know whether a given date is in a particular
       range, or what the overlap is between one range and another.  This module lets you ask such questions.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new()</b>
         my $range = Date::Range-&gt;new($date1, $date2);

       A range object is instantiated with two dates, which do not need to be in chronological order (we'll sort
       all that out internally).

       These dates must be instances of the correct object. See <b>want_class()</b> below.

   <b>want_class</b>
       The class of which we expect the date objects to be objects. By default this is Date::Simple, but this
       could be any other date class. See Time::Piece::Range for an example of a subclass that uses a different
       date class.

   <b>start</b> <b>/</b> <b>end</b> <b>/</b> <b>length</b>
         my $earliest = $range-&gt;start;
         my $latest   = $range-&gt;end;
         my $days     = $range-&gt;length;

       These methods allow you retrieve the start and end dates of the range, and the number of days in the
       range.

   <b>equals</b>
         if ($range1-&gt;equals($range2)) { }

       This tells you if two ranges are the same - i.e. start and end at the same dates.

   <b>includes</b>
         if ($range-&gt;includes($date3)) { ... }
         if ($range-&gt;includes($range2)) { ... }

       These methods tell you if a given range includes a given date, or a given range.

   <b>overlaps</b> <b>/</b> <b>overlap</b>
         if ($range-&gt;overlaps($range2)) {
           my $range3 = $range-&gt;overlap($range2);
         }

       These methods let you know whether one range overlaps another or not, and access this overlap range.

   <b>gap</b>
               my $range3 = $range-&gt;gap($range2);

       This returns a new range representing the gap between two other ranges.

   <b>abuts</b>
               if ($range-&gt;abuts($range2)) { ... }

       This tells you whether or not two ranges are contiguous - i.e. there is no gap between them, but they do
       not overlap.

   <b>dates</b>
         foreach my $date ($range-&gt;dates) { ... }

       This returns a list of each date in the range as a Date::Simple object.
