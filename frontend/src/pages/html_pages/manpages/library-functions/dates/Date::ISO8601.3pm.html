</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The international standard ISO 8601 "Data elements and interchange formats - Information interchange -
       Representation of dates and times" defines three distinct calendars by which days can be labelled.  It
       also defines textual formats for the representation of dates in these calendars.  This module provides
       functions to convert dates between these three calendars and Chronological Julian Day Numbers, which is a
       suitable format to do arithmetic with.  It also supplies functions that describe the shape of these
       calendars, to assist in calendrical calculations.  It also supplies functions to represent dates
       textually in the ISO 8601 formats.  ISO 8601 also covers time of day and time periods, but this module
       does nothing relating to those parts of the standard; this is only about labelling days.

       The first ISO 8601 calendar divides time up into years, months, and days.  It corresponds exactly to the
       Gregorian calendar, invented by Aloysius Lilius and promulgated by Pope Gregory XIII in the late
       sixteenth century, with AD (CE) year numbering.  This calendar is applied to all time, not just to dates
       after its invention nor just to years 1 and later.  Thus for ancient dates it is the proleptic Gregorian
       calendar with astronomical year numbering.

       The second ISO 8601 calendar divides time up into the same years as the first, but divides the year
       directly into days, with no months.  The standard calls this "ordinal dates".  Ordinal dates are commonly
       referred to as "Julian dates", a mistake apparently deriving from true Julian Day Numbers, which divide
       time up solely into linearly counted days.

       The third ISO 8601 calendar divides time up into years, weeks, and days.  The years approximate the years
       of the first two calendars, so they stay in step in the long term, but the boundaries differ.  This week-
       based calendar is sometimes called "the ISO calendar", apparently in the belief that ISO 8601 does not
       define any other.  It is also referred to as "business dates", because it is most used by certain
       businesses to whom the week is the most important temporal cycle.

       The Chronological Julian Day Number is an integral number labelling each day, where the day extends from
       midnight to midnight in whatever time zone is of interest.  It is a linear count of days, where each
       day's number is one greater than the previous day's number.  It is directly related to the Julian Date
       system: in the time zone of the prime meridian, the CJDN equals the JD at noon.  By way of epoch, the day
       on which the Convention of the Metre was signed, which ISO 8601 defines to be 1875-05-20 (and 1875-140
       and 1875-W20-4), is CJDN 2406029.

       This module places no limit on the range of dates to which it may be applied.  All function arguments are
       permitted to be "Math::BigInt" or "Math::BigRat" objects in order to achieve arbitrary range.  Native
       Perl integers are also permitted, as a convenience when the range of dates being handled is known to be
       sufficiently small.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Numbers in this API may be native Perl integers, "Math::BigInt" objects, or integer-valued "Math::BigRat"
       objects.  All three types are acceptable for all parameters, in any combination.  In all conversion
       functions, the most-significant part of the result (which is the only part with unlimited range) is of
       the same type as the most-significant part of the input.  Less-significant parts of results (which have a
       small range) are consistently native Perl integers.

       All functions "die" if given invalid parameters.

   <b>Years</b>
       present_y(YEAR)
           Puts  the  given  year number into ISO 8601 textual presentation format.  For years [0, 9999] this is
           simply four digits.  For years outside that range it is a sign followed by at least four digits.

           This is the minimum-length presentation format.  If it is desired to use a form that is  longer  than
           necessary,  such  as  to  use  at  least five digits for all year numbers (as the Long Now Foundation
           does), then the right tool is "sprintf" (see "sprintf" in perlfunc).

           This format is unconditionally conformant to all versions of ISO 8601 for years  [1583,  9999].   For
           years  [0,  1582],  preceding the historical introduction of the Gregorian calendar, it is conformant
           only where it is mutually agreed that such dates (represented in the  proleptic  Gregorian  calendar)
           are  acceptable.   For years outside the range [0, 9999], where the expanded format must be used, the
           result is only conformant to ISO 8601:2004 (earlier versions lacked these formats), and only where it
           is mutually agreed to use this format.

   <b>Gregorian</b> <b>calendar</b>
       Each year is divided into twelve months, numbered [1, 12]; month number 1  is  January.   Each  month  is
       divided into days, numbered sequentially from 1.  The month lengths are irregular.  The year numbers have
       unlimited range.

       month_days(YEAR, MONTH)
           The  parameters  identify  a  month,  and  the function returns the number of days in that month as a
           native Perl integer.

       cjdn_to_ymd(CJDN)
           This function takes a Chronological Julian Day Number and returns a list of a year, month, and day.

       ymd_to_cjdn(YEAR, MONTH, DAY)
           This performs the reverse of the translation that "cjdn_to_ymd" does.  It takes year, month, and  day
           numbers, and returns the corresponding CJDN.

       present_ymd(CJDN)
       present_ymd(YEAR, MONTH, DAY)
           Puts the given date into ISO 8601 Gregorian textual presentation format.  The `extended' format (with
           "-" separators) is used.  The conformance notes for "present_y" apply to this function also.

           If the date is given as a (YEAR, MONTH, DAY) triplet then these are not checked for consistency.  The
           MONTH  and DAY values are only checked to ensure that they fit into the fixed number of digits.  This
           allows the use of this function on data other than actual Gregorian dates.

   <b>Ordinal</b> <b>dates</b>
       Each year is divided into days, numbered sequentially from 1.  The year lengths are irregular.  The years
       correspond exactly to those of the Gregorian calendar.

       year_days(YEAR)
           The parameter identifies a year, and the function returns the number of days in that year as a native
           Perl integer.

       cjdn_to_yd(CJDN)
           This function takes a Chronological Julian Day Number and returns a list of a year and ordinal day.

       yd_to_cjdn(YEAR, DAY)
           This performs the reverse of the translation that "cjdn_to_yd" does.  It takes year and  ordinal  day
           numbers, and returns the corresponding CJDN.

       present_yd(CJDN)
       present_yd(YEAR, DAY)
           Puts  the  given date into ISO 8601 ordinal textual presentation format.  The `extended' format (with
           "-" separators) is used.  The conformance notes for "present_y" apply to this function also.

           If the date is given as a (YEAR, DAY) pair then these are not checked for consistency.  The DAY value
           is only checked to ensure that it fits into the fixed number of digits.  This allows the use of  this
           function on data other than actual ordinal dates.

   <b>Week-based</b> <b>calendar</b>
       Each  year  is  divided  into weeks, numbered sequentially from 1.  Each week is divided into seven days,
       numbered [1, 7]; day number 1 is Monday.   The  year  lengths  are  irregular.   The  year  numbers  have
       unlimited range.

       The years correspond to those of the Gregorian calendar.  Each week is associated with the Gregorian year
       that contains its Thursday and hence contains the majority of its days.

       year_weeks(YEAR)
           The  parameter  identifies  a  year,  and  the function returns the number of weeks in that year as a
           native Perl integer.

       cjdn_to_ywd(CJDN)
           This function takes a Chronological Julian Day Number and returns a list of a year, week, and day.

       ywd_to_cjdn(YEAR, WEEK, DAY)
           This performs the reverse of the translation that "cjdn_to_ywd" does.  It takes year, week,  and  day
           numbers, and returns the corresponding CJDN.

       present_ywd(CJDN)
       present_ywd(YEAR, WEEK, DAY)
           Puts  the  given  date  into  ISO 8601 week-based textual presentation format.  The `extended' format
           (with "-" separators) is used.  The conformance notes for "present_y" apply to this function also.

           If the date is given as a (YEAR, WEEK, DAY) triplet then these are not checked for consistency.   The
           WEEK  and  DAY values are only checked to ensure that they fit into the fixed number of digits.  This
           allows the use of this function on data other than actual week-based dates.
