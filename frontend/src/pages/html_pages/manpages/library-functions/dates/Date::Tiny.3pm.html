       Date::Tiny - A date object, with as little code as possible

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.07

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # Create a date manually
         $christmas = Date::Tiny-&gt;new(
             year  =&gt; 2006,
             month =&gt; 12,
             day   =&gt; 25,
             );

         # Show the current date
         $today = Date::Tiny-&gt;now;
         print "Year : " . $today-&gt;year  . "\n";
         print "Month: " . $today-&gt;month . "\n";
         print "Day  : " . $today-&gt;day   . "\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Date::Tiny</b> is a member of the DateTime::Tiny suite of time modules.

       It implements an extremely lightweight object that represents a date, without any time data.

   <b>The</b> <b>Tiny</b> <b>Mandate</b>
       Many CPAN modules which provide the best implementation of a concept can be very large. For some reason,
       this generally seems to be about 3 megabyte of ram usage to load the module.

       For a lot of the situations in which these large and comprehensive implementations exist, some people
       will only need a small fraction of the functionality, or only need this functionality in an ancillary
       role.

       The aim of the Tiny modules is to implement an alternative to the large module that implements a subset
       of the functionality, using as little code as possible.

       Typically, this means a module that implements between 50% and 80% of the features of the larger module,
       but using only 100 kilobytes of code, which is about 1/30th of the larger module.

   <b>The</b> <b>Concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tiny</b> <b>Date</b> <b>and</b> <b>Time</b>
       Due to the inherent complexity, Date and Time is intrinsically very difficult to implement properly.

       The arguably <b>only</b> module to implement it completely correct is DateTime. However, to implement it
       properly DateTime is quite slow and requires 3-4 megabytes of memory to load.

       The challenge in implementing a Tiny equivalent to DateTime is to do so without making the functionality
       critically flawed, and to carefully select the subset of functionality to implement.

       If you look at where the main complexity and cost exists, you will find that it is relatively cheap to
       represent a date or time as an object, but much much more expensive to modify or convert the object.

       As a result, <b>Date::Tiny</b> provides the functionality required to represent a date as an object, to
       stringify the date and to parse it back in, but does <b>not</b> allow you to modify the dates.

       The purpose of this is to allow for date object representations in situations like log parsing and fast
       real-time work.

       The problem with this is that having no ability to modify date limits the usefulness greatly.

       To make up for this, <b>if</b> you have DateTime installed, any <b>Date::Tiny</b> module can be inflated into the
       equivalent DateTime as needing, loading DateTime on the fly if necessary.

       For the purposes of date/time logic, all <b>Date::Tiny</b> objects exist in the "C" locale, and the "floating"
       time zone (although obviously in a pure date context, the time zone largely doesn't matter).

       When converting up to full DateTime objects, these local and time zone settings will be applied (although
       an ability is provided to override this).

       In addition, the implementation is strictly correct and is intended to be very easily to sub-class for
       specific purposes of your own.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       In general, the intent is that the API be as close as possible to the API for DateTime. Except, of
       course, that this module implements less of it.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         my $date = Date::Tiny-&gt;new(
             year  =&gt; 2006,
             month =&gt; 12,
             day   =&gt; 31,
             );

       The "new" constructor creates a new <b>Date::Tiny</b> object.

       It takes three named parameters. "day" should be the day of the month (1-31), "month" should be the month
       of the year (1-12), "year" as a 4 digit year.

       These are the only parameters accepted.

       Returns a new <b>Date::Tiny</b> object.

   <b>now</b>
         my $current_date = Date::Tiny-&gt;now;

       The "now" method creates a new date object for the current date.

       The date created will be based on localtime, despite the fact that the date is created in the floating
       time zone.

       Returns a new <b>Date::Tiny</b> object.

   <b>year</b>
       The "year" accessor returns the 4-digit year for the date.

   <b>month</b>
       The "month" accessor returns the 1-12 month of the year for the date.

   <b>day</b>
       The "day" accessor returns the 1-31 day of the month for the date.

   <b>ymd</b>
       The "ymd" method returns the most common and accurate stringified date format, which returns in the form
       "2006-04-12".

   <b>as_string</b>
       The "as_string" method converts the date to the default string, which at present is the same as that
       returned by the "ymd" method above.

       This string matches the ISO 8601 standard for the encoding of a date as a string.

   <b>from_string</b>
       The "from_string" method creates a new <b>Date::Tiny</b> object from a string.

       The string is expected to be a "yyyy-mm-dd" ISO 8601 time string.

         my $almost_christmas = Date::Tiny-&gt;from_string( '2006-12-23' );

       Returns a new <b>Date::Tiny</b> object, or throws an exception on error.

   <b>DateTime</b>
       The "DateTime" method is used to create a DateTime object that is equivalent to the <b>Date::Tiny</b> object,
       for use in conversions and calculations.

       As mentioned earlier, the object will be set to the 'C' locate, and the 'floating' time zone.

       If installed, the DateTime module will be loaded automatically.

       Returns a DateTime object, or throws an exception if DateTime is not installed on the current host.
