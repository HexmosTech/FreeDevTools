       Notes
       =====

       Each  global  data  object  is  described  by  an  associated description vector.  This vector stores the
       information required to establish the mapping between an object element and its corresponding process and
       memory location.

       Let A be a generic term for any 2D block  cyclicly  distributed  array.   Such  a  global  array  has  an
       associated  description  vector  DESCA.  In the following comments, the character _ should be read as "of
       the global array".

       NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
       --------------- -------------- -------------------------------------- DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_  )The
       descriptor type.  In this case,
                                      DTYPE_A = 1.
       CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
                                      the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
                                      ted over. The context itself is glo-
                                      bal, but the handle (the integer
                                      value) may vary.
       M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
                                      array A.
       N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
                                      array A.
       MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the rows of the array.
       NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the columns of the array.
       RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
                                      row  of  the  array  A is distributed.  CSRC_A (global) DESCA( CSRC_ ) The
       process column over which the
                                      first column of the array A is
                                      distributed.
       LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
                                      array.  LLD_A &gt;= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).

       Let K be the number of rows or columns of a distributed matrix, and assume  that  its  process  grid  has
       dimension p x q.
       LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the
       p processes of its process column.
       Similarly,  LOCc(  K  )  denotes  the  number  of  elements  of  K that a process would receive if K were
       distributed over the q processes of its process row.
       The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
               LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
               LOCc( N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).  An upper bound for these quantities may  be
       computed by:
               LOCr( M ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
               LOCc( N ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       UPLO    (global input) CHARACTER
               Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the Hermitian matrix sub( A ) is stored:
               = 'U':  Upper triangular
               = 'L':  Lower triangular

       N       (global input) INTEGER
               The  number  of  rows  and columns to be operated on, i.e. the order of the distributed submatrix
               sub( A ). N &gt;= 0.

       A       (local input/local output) COMPLEX*16 pointer into the
               local memory to an array of dimension (LLD_A,LOCc(JA+N-1)).  On entry, this  array  contains  the
               local  pieces  of  the  Hermitian distributed matrix sub( A ).  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
               upper triangular part of sub( A ) contains the upper triangular  part  of  the  matrix,  and  its
               strictly  lower  triangular  part  is  not  referenced.  If  UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
               triangular part of sub( A ) contains the lower triangular part of the matrix,  and  its  strictly
               upper  triangular  part  is  not  referenced.  On  exit,  if  UPLO  = 'U', the diagonal and first
               superdiagonal of sub( A ) are over- written by the  corresponding  elements  of  the  tridiagonal
               matrix  T,  and  the  elements  above  the first superdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the
               unitary matrix Q as a product of elementary reflectors; if UPLO = 'L',  the  diagonal  and  first
               subdiagonal  of  sub( A ) are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal matrix
               T, and the elements below the first subdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the unitary matrix
               Q as a product of elementary reflectors. See Further Details.  IA      (global input) INTEGER The
               row index in the global array A indicating the first row of sub( A ).

       JA      (global input) INTEGER
               The column index in the global array A indicating the first column of sub( A ).

       DESCA   (global and local input) INTEGER array of dimension DLEN_.
               The array descriptor for the distributed matrix A.

       D       (local output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension LOCc(JA+N-1)
               The diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T: D(i) = A(i,i). D is tied  to  the  distributed
               matrix A.

       E       (local output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension LOCc(JA+N-1)
               if  UPLO  =  'U',  LOCc(JA+N-2) otherwise. The off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
               E(i) = A(i,i+1) if UPLO = 'U', E(i) = A(i+1,i) if UPLO = 'L'. E is tied to the distributed matrix
               A.

       TAU     (local output) COMPLEX*16, array, dimension
               LOCc(JA+N-1). This array contains the scalar factors TAU of the  elementary  reflectors.  TAU  is
               tied to the distributed matrix A.

       WORK    (local workspace/local output) COMPLEX*16 array,
               dimension (LWORK) On exit, WORK( 1 ) returns the minimal and optimal LWORK.

       LWORK   (local or global input) INTEGER
               The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK is local input and must be at least LWORK &gt;= 3*N.

               If  LWORK  =  -1,  then  LWORK is global input and a workspace query is assumed; the routine only
               calculates the minimum and optimal size for all work arrays. Each of these values is returned  in
               the first entry of the corresponding work array, and no error message is issued by PXERBLA.

       INFO    (local output) INTEGER
               = 0:  successful exit
               &lt;  0:   If  the  i-th  argument  is  an  array  and the j-entry had an illegal value, then INFO =
               -(i*100+j), if the i-th argument is a scalar and had an illegal value, then INFO = -i.

</pre><h4><b>FURTHER</b> <b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       If UPLO = 'U', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary reflectors

          Q = H(n-1) . . . <a href="../man2/H.2.html">H</a>(2) <a href="../man1/H.1.html">H</a>(1).

       Each H(i) has the form

          H(i) = I - tau * v * v'

       where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with v(i+1:n) = 0 and  v(i)  =  1;  v(1:i-1)  is
       stored on exit in
       A(ia:ia+i-2,ja+i), and tau in TAU(ja+i-1).

       If UPLO = 'L', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary reflectors

          Q = <a href="../man1/H.1.html">H</a>(1) <a href="../man2/H.2.html">H</a>(2) . . . H(n-1).

       Each H(i) has the form

          H(i) = I - tau * v * v'

       where  tau  is  a  complex  scalar, and v is a complex vector with v(1:i) = 0 and v(i+1) = 1; v(i+2:n) is
       stored on exit in
       A(ia+i+1:ia+n-1,ja+i-1), and tau in TAU(ja+i-1).

       The contents of sub( A ) on exit are illustrated by the following examples with n = 5:

       if UPLO = 'U':                       if UPLO = 'L':

         (  d   e   v2  v3  v4 )              (  d                  )
         (      d   e   v3  v4 )              (  e   d              )
         (          d   e   v4 )              (  v1  e   d          )
         (              d   e  )              (  v1  v2  e   d      )
         (                  d  )              (  v1  v2  v3  e   d  )

       where d and e denote diagonal and off-diagonal elements of T, and vi denotes an  element  of  the  vector
       defining H(i).

       Alignment requirements
       ======================

       The  distributed  submatrix  sub(  A  )  must  verify  some  alignment proper- ties, namely the following
       expression should be true:
       ( MB_A.EQ.NB_A .AND. IROFFA.EQ.ICOFFA ) with
       IROFFA = MOD( IA-1, MB_A ) and ICOFFA = MOD( JA-1, NB_A ).
