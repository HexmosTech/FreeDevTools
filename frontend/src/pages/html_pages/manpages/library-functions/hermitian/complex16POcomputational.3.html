       <b>ZLA_PORFSX_EXTENDED</b> improves the computed solution to a system of linear equations for symmetric or
       Hermitian positive-definite matrices by performing extra-precise iterative refinement and provides error
       bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            ZLA_PORFSX_EXTENDED improves the computed solution to a system of
            linear equations by performing extra-precise iterative refinement
            and provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.
            This subroutine is called by ZPORFSX to perform iterative refinement.
            In addition to normwise error bound, the code provides maximum
            componentwise error bound if possible. See comments for ERR_BNDS_NORM
            and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the error bounds. Note that this
            subroutine is only resonsible for setting the second fields of
            ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>PREC_TYPE</u>

                     PREC_TYPE is INTEGER
                Specifies the intermediate precision to be used in refinement.
                The value is defined by ILAPREC(P) where P is a CHARACTER and P
                     = 'S':  Single
                     = 'D':  Double
                     = 'I':  Indigenous
                     = 'X' or 'E':  Extra

           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                  = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
                  = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
                matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>NRHS</u>

                     NRHS is INTEGER
                The number of right-hand-sides, i.e., the number of columns of the
                matrix B.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
                On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>AF</u>

                     AF is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAF,N)
                The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
                A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, as computed by ZPOTRF.

           <u>LDAF</u>

                     LDAF is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>COLEQU</u>

                     COLEQU is LOGICAL
                If .TRUE. then column equilibration was done to A before calling
                this routine. This is needed to compute the solution and error
                bounds correctly.

           <u>C</u>

                     C is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
                The column scale factors for A. If COLEQU = .FALSE., C
                is not accessed. If C is input, each element of C should be a power
                of the radix to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates.
                Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless
                the result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
                lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
                input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
                reliable.

           <u>B</u>

                     B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)

                The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>Y</u>

                     Y is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDY,NRHS)
                On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by ZPOTRS.
                On exit, the improved solution matrix Y.

           <u>LDY</u>

                     LDY is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array Y.  LDY &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>BERR_OUT</u>

                     BERR_OUT is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
                On exit, BERR_OUT(j) contains the componentwise relative backward
                error for right-hand-side j from the formula
                    max(i) ( abs(RES(i)) / ( abs(op(A_s))*abs(Y) + abs(B_s) )(i) )
                where abs(Z) is the componentwise absolute value of the matrix
                or vector Z. This is computed by ZLA_LIN_BERR.

           <u>N_NORMS</u>

                     N_NORMS is INTEGER
                Determines which error bounds to return (see ERR_BNDS_NORM
                and ERR_BNDS_COMP).
                If N_NORMS &gt;= 1 return normwise error bounds.
                If N_NORMS &gt;= 2 return componentwise error bounds.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_NORM</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_NORM is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                        max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
                       ------------------------------
                             max_j abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
                below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
                returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only

           <u>ERR_BNDS_COMP</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_COMP is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                               abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
                        max_j ----------------------
                                    abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
                componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
                information as described below. There currently are up to three
                pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
                componentwise accuracy is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0), then
                ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS &lt; 3, then at most
                the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
                         current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                         A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
                         sums of Z are approximately 1.

                reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
                equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
                precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
                to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
                if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
                conditioned.

           <u>ITHRESH</u>

                permit convergence using approximate factorizations or
                factorizations other than LU. If the factorization uses a
                technique other than Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP may no longer be trustworthy.

           <u>RTHRESH</u>

                     RTHRESH is DOUBLE PRECISION
                Determines when to stop refinement if the error estimate stops
                decreasing. Refinement will stop when the next solution no longer
                satisfies norm(dx_{i+1}) &lt; RTHRESH * norm(dx_i) where norm(Z) is
                the infinity norm of Z. RTHRESH satisfies 0 &lt; RTHRESH &lt;= 1. The
                default value is 0.5. For 'aggressive' set to 0.9 to permit
                convergence on extremely ill-conditioned matrices. See LAWN 165
                for more details.

           <u>DZ_UB</u>

                     DZ_UB is DOUBLE PRECISION
                Determines when to start considering componentwise convergence.
                Componentwise convergence is only considered after each component
                of the solution Y is stable, which we define as the relative
                change in each component being less than DZ_UB. The default value
                is 0.25, requiring the first bit to be stable. See LAWN 165 for
                more details.

           <u>IGNORE_CWISE</u>

                     IGNORE_CWISE is LOGICAL
                If .TRUE. then ignore componentwise convergence. Default value
                is .FALSE..

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER

       <b>ZLA_PORPVGRW</b> computes the reciprocal pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U) for a symmetric or Hermitian
       positive-definite matrix.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            ZLA_PORPVGRW computes the reciprocal pivot growth factor
            norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element" norm is used. If this is
            much less than 1, the stability of the LU factorization of the
            (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor. This also means that the
            solution X, estimated condition numbers, and error bounds could be
            unreliable.

            elements B(i,j) = S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has ones on the diagonal.  This
            choice of S puts the condition number of B within a factor N of the

           <u>S</u>

                     S is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
                     If INFO = 0, S contains the scale factors for A.

           <u>SCOND</u>

                     SCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
                     If INFO = 0, S contains the ratio of the smallest S(i) to
                     the largest S(i).  If SCOND &gt;= 0.1 and AMAX is neither too
                     large nor too small, it is not worth scaling by S.

            ZPOEQUB computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a
            Hermitian positive definite matrix A and reduce its condition number
            (with respect to the two-norm).  S contains the scale factors,

            choice of S puts the condition number of B within a factor N of the
            smallest possible condition number over all possible diagonal

            This routine differs from ZPOEQU by restricting the scaling factors
            to a power of the radix.  Barring over- and underflow, scaling by
            these factors introduces no additional rounding errors.  However, the
            scaled diagonal entries are no longer approximately 1 but lie
            between sqrt(radix) and 1/sqrt(radix).

                     SCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
                     If INFO = 0, S contains the ratio of the smallest S(i) to
                     the largest S(i).  If SCOND &gt;= 0.1 and AMAX is neither too
                     large nor too small, it is not worth scaling by S.

           <u>AMAX</u>

                     AMAX is DOUBLE PRECISION
                     Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
                     close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
                     should be scaled.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit
                     &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
                     &gt; 0:  if INFO = i, the i-th diagonal element is nonpositive.

                     triangular part of A contains the lower triangular part of
                     the matrix A, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is

                     X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
                     If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
                     is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
                     element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
                     largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
                     the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight

       <b>ZPORFSX</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

               ZPORFSX improves the computed solution to a system of linear
               equations when the coefficient matrix is Hermitian positive
               definite, and provides error bounds and backward error estimates
               for the solution.  In addition to normwise error bound, the code
               provides maximum componentwise error bound if possible.  See
               comments for ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the
               error bounds.

               The original system of linear equations may have been equilibrated
               before calling this routine, as described by arguments EQUED and S
               below. In this case, the solution and error bounds returned are
               for the original unequilibrated system.

                Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
                settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
                defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
                can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
                the PARAMS argument.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                  = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
                  = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

           <u>EQUED</u>

                     EQUED is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies the form of equilibration that was done to A
                before calling this routine. This is needed to compute
                the solution and error bounds correctly.
                  = 'N':  No equilibration
                  = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
                          replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
                          The right hand side B has been changed accordingly.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                The order of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>NRHS</u>

                     NRHS is INTEGER
                The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
                of the matrices B and X.  NRHS &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
                The Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
                upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular part
                of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular part of A
                is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
                triangular part of A contains the lower triangular part of
                the matrix A, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is
                not referenced.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>AF</u>

                     AF is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAF,N)
                The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
                A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H, as computed by ZPOTRF.

           <u>LDAF</u>

                     LDAF is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>S</u>

                     S is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
                The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
                the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
                'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
                = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
                element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
                of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
                and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
                rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
                Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
                is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
                that may not be reliable.

           <u>B</u>

                     B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
                The right hand side matrix B.

           <u>LDB</u>

                     LDB is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>X</u>

                     X is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
                On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by ZGETRS.
                On exit, the improved solution matrix X.

           <u>LDX</u>

                     LDX is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>RCOND</u>

                     RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
                Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
                reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
                equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
                precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
                to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
                if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
                conditioned.

           <u>BERR</u>

                     BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
                Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
                componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
                (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
                makes X(j) an exact solution).

           <u>N_ERR_BNDS</u>

                     N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
                Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
                and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
                ERR_BNDS_COMP below.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_NORM</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_NORM is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                        max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
                       ------------------------------
                             max_j abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
                below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
                returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
                         radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

                See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
                cautions.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_COMP</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_COMP is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                               abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
                        max_j ----------------------
                                    abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
                componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
                information as described below. There currently are up to three
                pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
                componentwise accuracy is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0), then
                ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS &lt; 3, then at most
                the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
                         current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                         A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
                         sums of Z are approximately 1.

       <b>ZPOTRS</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            ZPOTRS solves a system of linear equations A*X = B with a Hermitian
            positive definite matrix A using the Cholesky factorization
            A = U**H * U or A = L * L**H computed by ZPOTRF.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                     = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
                     = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                     The order of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>NRHS</u>

                     NRHS is INTEGER
                     The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
                     of the matrix B.  NRHS &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
                     A = U**H * U or A = L * L**H, as computed by ZPOTRF.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>B</u>

                     B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
                     On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
                     On exit, the solution matrix X.

           <u>LDB</u>

                     LDB is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit
                     &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
