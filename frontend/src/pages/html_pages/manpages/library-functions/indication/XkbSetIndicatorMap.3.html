</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This section discusses the effects of explicitly changing indicators depending upon different settings in
       the indicator map. See Tables 1 and Table 2 for information on the effects of the  indicator  map  fields
       when explicit changes are made.

       XkbIM_UseLatched     On          The groups field is treated as
                                        a  group  mask.  The  keyboard
                                        group latch is changed to  the
                                        lowest      numbered     group
                                        specified in groups; if groups
                                        is empty, the  keyboard  group
                                        latch is changed to zero.
       XkbIM_UseLatched     Off         The groups field is treated as
                                        a group mask. If the indicator
                                        is   explicitly  extinguished,
                                        keyboard   group   latch    is
                                        changed to the lowest numbered

                                        if   groups   is   zero,   the
                                        keyboard group latch is set to
                                        the index of the highest legal
                                        keyboard group.

                                        group    is    not    changed;
                                        otherwise, the locked keyboard
                                        group is changed to the lowest
                                        numbered  group  specified  in
                                        groups.

                                         from  both  the   locked   and
                                         latched modifiers.

       If  XkbIM_LEDDrivesKB  is  set  and  XkbIM_NoExplicit is not, and if you call a function that updates the
       server's image of the indicator map (such as <u>XkbSetIndicatorMap</u> or <u>XkbSetNamedIndicator</u>), Xkb changes the
       keyboard state and controls to reflect the  other  fields  of  the  indicator  map.  If  you  attempt  to
       explicitly  change  the  value  of  an  indicator  for  which  XkbIM_LEDDrivesKB  is  absent or for which
       XkbIM_NoExplicit is present, keyboard state or controls are unaffected.

       If neither XkbIM_NoAutomatic nor XkbIM_NoExplicit is set in an indicator map, Xkb honors any  request  to
       change the state of the indicator, but the new state might be immediately superseded by automatic changes
       to the indicator state if the keyboard state or controls change.

       The effects of changing an indicator that drives the keyboard are cumulative; it is possible for a single
       change to affect keyboard group, modifiers, and controls simultaneously.

       If  you  change  an  indicator  for  which  both  the  XkbIM_LEDDrivesKB  and XkbIM_NoAutomatic flags are
       specified, Xkb applies the keyboard changes specified in the other indicator map fields and  changes  the
       indicator  to  reflect  the  state  that was explicitly requested. The indicator remains in the new state
       until it is explicitly changed again.

       If the XkbIM_NoAutomatic flag is not set and XkbIM_LEDDrivesKB is set, Xkb applies the changes  specified
       in  the  other  indicator  map  fields and sets the state of the indicator to the values specified by the
       indicator map. Note that it is possible in this case for the indicator to end up  in  a  different  state
       than  the  one  that  was  explicitly  requested.  For example, Xkb does not extinguish an indicator with
       <u>which_mods</u> of XkbIM_UseBase and <u>mods</u> of Shift if, at the time Xkb processes the request to extinguish the
       indicator, one of the Shift keys is physically depressed.

       If you explicitly light an indicator for which XkbIM_LEDDrivesKB is set, Xkb enables all of  the  boolean
       controls  specified  in  the <u>ctrls</u> field of its indicator map. Explicitly extinguishing such an indicator
       causes Xkb to disable all of the boolean controls specified in <u>ctrls.</u>

       For each bit set in the <u>which</u> parameter, <u>XkbSetIndicatorMap</u> sends the corresponding  indicator  map  from
       the <u>desc</u> parameter to the server.
