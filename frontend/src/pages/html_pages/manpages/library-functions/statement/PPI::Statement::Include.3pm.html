</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PPI::Statement::Include - Statements that include other code

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # The following are all includes
         use 5.006;
         use strict;
         use My::Module;
         use constant FOO =&gt; 'Foo';
         require Foo::Bar;
         require "Foo/Bar.pm";
         require $foo if 1;
         no strict 'refs';

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
         PPI::Statement::Include
         isa PPI::Statement
             isa PPI::Node
                 isa PPI::Element

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Despite its name, the "PPI::Statement::Include" class covers a number of different types of statement
       that cover all statements starting with "use", "no" and "require".

       But basically, they cover three situations.

       Firstly, a dependency on a particular version of perl (for which the "version" method returns true), a
       pragma (for which the "pragma" method returns true), or the loading (and unloading via no) of modules.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "PPI::Statement::Include" has a number of methods in addition to the standard PPI::Statement, PPI::Node
       and PPI::Element methods.

   <b>type</b>
       The "type" method returns the general type of statement ('use', 'no' or 'require').

       Returns the type as a string, or "undef" if the type cannot be detected.

   <b>module</b>
       The "module" method returns the module name specified in any include statement. This "includes" pragma
       names, because pragma are implemented as modules. (And lets face it, the definition of a pragma can be
       fuzzy at the best of times in any case)

       This covers all of these...

         use strict;
         use My::Module;
         no strict;
         require My::Module;

       ...but does not cover any of these...

         use 5.006;
         require 5.005;
         require "explicit/file/name.pl";

       Returns the module name as a string, or "undef" if the include does not specify a module name.

   <b>module_version</b>
       The "module_version" method returns the minimum version of the module required by the statement, if there
       is one.

   <b>pragma</b>
       The "pragma" method checks for an include statement's use as a pragma, and returns it if so.

       Or at least, it claims to. In practice it's a lot harder to say exactly what is or isn't a pragma,
       because the definition is fuzzy.

       The "intent" of a pragma is to modify the way in which the parser works.  This is done though the use of
       modules that do various types of internals magic.

       For now, PPI assumes that any "module name" that is only a set of lowercase letters (and perhaps numbers,
       like "use utf8;"). This behaviour is expected to change, most likely to something that knows the specific
       names of the various "pragmas".

       Returns the name of the pragma, or false ('') if the include is not a pragma.

   <b>version</b>
       The "version" method checks for an include statement that introduces a dependency on the version of
       "perl" the code is compatible with.

       This covers two specific statements.

         use 5.006;
         require 5.006;

       Currently the version is returned as a string, although in future the version may be returned as a
       version object.  If you want a numeric representation, use version_literal().  Returns false if the
       statement is not a version dependency.

   <b>version_literal</b>
       The "version_literal" method has the same behavior as version(), but the version is returned as a numeric
       literal.  Returns false if the statement is not a version dependency.

   <b>arguments</b>
       The "arguments" method gives you the rest of the statement after the module/pragma and module version,
       i.e. the stuff that will be used to construct what gets passed to the module's import() subroutine.  This
       does include the comma, etc. operators, but doesn't include non-significant direct children or any final
       semicolon.

   <b>feature_mods</b>
               # `use feature 'signatures';`
               my %mods = $include-&gt;feature_mods;
               # { signatures =&gt; "perl" }

               # `use 5.036;`
               my %mods = $include-&gt;feature_mods;
               # { signatures =&gt; "perl" }

       Returns a hashref of features identified as enabled by the include, or undef if the include does not
       enable features. The value for each feature indicates the provider of the feature.
