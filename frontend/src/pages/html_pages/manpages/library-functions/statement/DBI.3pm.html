       If you think you've found a memory leak then read "Memory Leaks".

       Your problem is most likely related to the specific DBD driver module you're using. If that's the case
       then click on the 'Bugs' link on the &lt;https://metacpan.org&gt; page for your driver. Only submit a bug
       report against the DBI itself if you're sure that your issue isn't related to the driver you're using.

   <b>NOTES</b>
       This is the DBI specification that corresponds to DBI version 1.647 (see DBI::Changes for details).

       The DBI is evolving at a steady pace, so it's good to check that you have the latest copy.

       The significant user-visible changes in each release are documented in the DBI::Changes module so you can
       read them by executing "perldoc DBI::Changes".

       Some DBI changes require changes in the drivers, but the drivers can take some time to catch up. Newer
       versions of the DBI have added features that may not yet be supported by the drivers you use.  Talk to
       the authors of your drivers if you need a new feature that is not yet supported.

       Features added after DBI 1.21 (February 2002) are marked in the text with the version number of the DBI
       release they first appeared in.

       Extensions to the DBI API often use the "DBIx::*" namespace.  See "Naming Conventions and Name Space".
       DBI extension modules can be found at &lt;https://metacpan.org/search?q=DBIx&gt;.  And all modules related to
       the DBI can be found at &lt;https://metacpan.org/search?q=DBI&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The DBI is a database access module for the Perl programming language.  It defines a set of methods,
       variables, and conventions that provide a consistent database interface, independent of the actual
       database being used.

       It is important to remember that the DBI is just an interface.  The DBI is a layer of "glue" between an
       application and one or more database <u>driver</u> modules.  It is the driver modules which do most of the real
       work. The DBI provides a standard interface and framework for the drivers to operate within.

       This document often uses terms like <u>references</u>, <u>objects</u>, <u>methods</u>.  If you're not familiar with those
       terms then it would be a good idea to read at least the following perl manuals first: perlreftut,
       perldsc, perllol, and perlboot.

   <b>Architecture</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>Application</b>
                    |&lt;- Scope of DBI -&gt;|
                         .-.   .--------------.   .-------------.
         .-------.       | |---| XYZ Driver   |---| XYZ Engine  |
         | Perl  |       | |   `--------------'   `-------------'
         | script|  |A|  |D|   .--------------.   .-------------.

         `-------'       | |...
                         `-'

       The API, or Application Programming Interface, defines the call interface and variables for Perl scripts
       to use. The API is implemented by the Perl DBI extension.

       The DBI "dispatches" the method calls to the appropriate driver for actual execution.  The DBI is also
       responsible for the dynamic loading of drivers, error checking and handling, providing default
       implementations for methods, and many other non-database specific duties.

       Each driver contains implementations of the DBI methods using the private interface functions of the
       corresponding database engine.  Only authors of sophisticated/multi-database applications or generic
       library functions need be concerned with drivers.

   <b>Notation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Conventions</b>
       The following conventions are used in this document:

         $dbh    Database handle object
         $sth    Statement handle object
         $drh    Driver handle object (rarely seen or used in applications)
         $h      Any of the handle types above ($dbh, $sth, or $drh)
         $rc     General Return Code  (boolean: true=ok, false=error)
         $rv     General Return Value (typically an integer)
         @ary    List of values returned from the database, typically a row of data
         $rows   Number of rows processed (if available, else -1)
         $fh     A filehandle
         undef   NULL values are represented by undefined values in Perl
         \%attr  Reference to a hash of attribute values passed to methods

       Note that Perl will automatically destroy database and statement handle objects if all references to them
       are deleted.

   <b>Outline</b> <b>Usage</b>
       To use DBI, first you need to load the DBI module:

         use DBI;
         use strict;

       (The "use strict;" isn't required but is strongly recommended.)

       Then you need to "connect" to your data source and get a <u>handle</u> for that connection:

         $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect($dsn, $user, $password,
                             { RaiseError =&gt; 1, AutoCommit =&gt; 0 });

       Since connecting can be expensive, you generally just connect at the start of your program and disconnect
       at the end.

       Explicitly defining the required "AutoCommit" behaviour is strongly recommended and may become mandatory
       in a later version.  This determines whether changes are automatically committed to the database when
       executed, or need to be explicitly committed later.

       The DBI allows an application to "prepare" statements for later execution.  A prepared statement is
       identified by a statement handle held in a Perl variable.  We'll call the Perl variable $sth in our
       examples.

       The typical method call sequence for a "SELECT" statement is:

         prepare,
           execute, fetch, fetch, ...
           execute, fetch, fetch, ...
           execute, fetch, fetch, ...

       for example:

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("SELECT foo, bar FROM table WHERE baz=?");

         $sth-&gt;execute( $baz );

         while ( @row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_array ) {
           print "@row\n";
         }

       For queries that are not executed many times at once, it is often cleaner to use the higher level select
       wrappers:

         $row_hashref = $dbh-&gt;selectrow_hashref("SELECT foo, bar FROM table WHERE baz=?", undef, $baz);

         $arrayref_of_row_hashrefs = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref(
           "SELECT foo, bar FROM table WHERE baz BETWEEN ? AND ?",
           { Slice =&gt; {} }, $baz_min, $baz_max);

       The typical method call sequence for a <u>non</u>-"SELECT" statement is:

         prepare,
           execute,
           execute,
           execute.

       for example:

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("INSERT INTO table(foo,bar,baz) VALUES (?,?,?)");

         while(&lt;CSV&gt;) {
           chomp;
           my ($foo,$bar,$baz) = split /,/;
               $sth-&gt;execute( $foo, $bar, $baz );
         }

       The do() method is a wrapper of prepare and execute that can be simpler for non repeated <u>non</u>-"SELECT"
       statements (or with drivers that don't support placeholders):

         $rows_affected = $dbh-&gt;do("UPDATE your_table SET foo = foo + 1");

         $rows_affected = $dbh-&gt;do("DELETE FROM table WHERE foo = ?", undef, $foo);

       To commit your changes to the database (when "AutoCommit" is off):

         $dbh-&gt;commit;  # or call $dbh-&gt;rollback; to undo changes

       Finally, when you have finished working with the data source, you should "disconnect" from it:

         $dbh-&gt;disconnect;

   <b>General</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Caveats</b>
       The DBI does not have a concept of a "current session". Every session has a handle object (i.e., a $dbh)
       returned from the "connect" method.  That handle object is used to invoke database related methods.

       Most data is returned to the Perl script as strings. (Null values are returned as "undef".)  This allows
       arbitrary precision numeric data to be handled without loss of accuracy.  Beware that Perl may not
       preserve the same accuracy when the string is used as a number.

       Dates and times are returned as character strings in the current default format of the corresponding
       database engine.  Time zone effects are database/driver dependent.

       Perl supports binary data in Perl strings, and the DBI will pass binary data to and from the driver
       without change. It is up to the driver implementors to decide how they wish to handle such binary data.

       Perl supports two kinds of strings: Unicode (utf8 internally) and non-Unicode (defaults to iso-8859-1 if
       forced to assume an encoding).  Drivers should accept both kinds of strings and, if required, convert
       them to the character set of the database being used. Similarly, when fetching from the database
       character data that isn't iso-8859-1 the driver should convert it into utf8.

       Multiple SQL statements may not be combined in a single statement handle ($sth), although some databases
       and drivers do support this (notably Sybase and SQL Server).

       Non-sequential record reads are not supported in this version of the DBI.  In other words, records can
       only be fetched in the order that the database returned them, and once fetched they are forgotten.

       Positioned updates and deletes are not directly supported by the DBI.  See the description of the
       "CursorName" attribute for an alternative.

       Individual driver implementors are free to provide any private functions and/or handle attributes that
       they feel are useful.  Private driver functions can be invoked using the DBI func() method.  Private
       driver attributes are accessed just like standard attributes.

       Many methods have an optional "\%attr" parameter which can be used to pass information to the driver
       implementing the method. Except where specifically documented, the "\%attr" parameter can only be used to
       pass driver specific hints. In general, you can ignore "\%attr" parameters or pass it as "undef".

   <b>Naming</b> <b>Conventions</b> <b>and</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Space</b>
       The DBI package and all packages below it ("DBI::*") are reserved for use by the DBI. Extensions and
       related modules use the "DBIx::" namespace (see &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/DBIx/">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/DBIx/</a>&gt;).
       Package names beginning with "DBD::" are reserved for use by DBI database drivers.  All environment
       variables used by the DBI or by individual DBDs begin with ""DBI_"" or ""DBD_"".

       The letter case used for attribute names is significant and plays an important part in the portability of
       DBI scripts.  The case of the attribute name is used to signify who defined the meaning of that name and
       its values.

         Case of name  Has a meaning defined by
         ------------  ------------------------
         UPPER_CASE    Standards, e.g.,  X/Open, ISO SQL92 etc (portable)
         MixedCase     DBI API (portable), underscores are not used.
         lower_case    Driver or database engine specific (non-portable)

       It is of the utmost importance that Driver developers only use lowercase attribute names when defining
       private attributes. Private attribute names must be prefixed with the driver name or suitable
       abbreviation (e.g., ""ora_"" for Oracle, ""ing_"" for Ingres, etc).

   <b>SQL</b> <b>-</b> <b>A</b> <b>Query</b> <b>Language</b>
       Most DBI drivers require applications to use a dialect of SQL (Structured Query Language) to interact
       with the database engine.  The "Standards Reference Information" section provides links to useful
       information about SQL.

       The DBI itself does not mandate or require any particular language to be used; it is language
       independent. In ODBC terms, the DBI is in "pass-thru" mode, although individual drivers might not be. The
       only requirement is that queries and other statements must be expressed as a single string of characters
       passed as the first argument to the "prepare" or "do" methods.

   <b>Placeholders</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bind</b> <b>Values</b>
       Some drivers support placeholders and bind values.  <u>Placeholders</u>, also called parameter markers, are used
       to indicate values in a database statement that will be supplied later, before the prepared statement is
       executed.  For example, an application might use the following to insert a row of data into the SALES
       table:

         INSERT INTO sales (product_code, qty, price) VALUES (?, ?, ?)

       or the following, to select the description for a product:

         SELECT description FROM products WHERE product_code = ?

       The "?" characters are the placeholders.  The association of actual values with placeholders is known as
       <u>binding</u>, and the values are referred to as <u>bind</u> <u>values</u>.  Note that the "?" is not enclosed in quotation
       marks, even when the placeholder represents a string.

       Some drivers also allow placeholders like ":"<u>name</u> and ":"<u>N</u> (e.g., ":1", ":2", and so on) in addition to
       "?", but their use is not portable.

       If the ":"<u>N</u> form of placeholder is supported by the driver you're using, then you should be able to use
       either "bind_param" or "execute" to bind values. Check your driver documentation.

       Some drivers allow you to prevent the recognition of a placeholder by placing a single backslash
       character ("\") immediately before it. The driver will remove the backslash character and ignore the
       placeholder, passing it unchanged to the backend. If the driver supports this then "get_info"(9000) will
       return true.

       With most drivers, placeholders can't be used for any element of a statement that would prevent the
       database server from validating the statement and creating a query execution plan for it. For example:

         "SELECT name, age FROM ?"         # wrong (will probably fail)
         "SELECT name, ?   FROM people"    # wrong (but may not 'fail')

       Also, placeholders can only represent single scalar values.  For example, the following statement won't
       work as expected for more than one value:

         "SELECT name, age FROM people WHERE name IN (?)"    # wrong
         "SELECT name, age FROM people WHERE name IN (?,?)"  # two names

       When using placeholders with the SQL "LIKE" qualifier, you must remember that the placeholder substitutes
       for the whole string.  So you should use ""... LIKE ? ..."" and include any wildcard characters in the
       value that you bind to the placeholder.

       <b>NULL</b> <b>Values</b>

       Undefined values, or "undef", are used to indicate NULL values.  You can insert and update columns with a
       NULL value as you would a non-NULL value.  These examples insert and update the column "age" with a NULL
       value:

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(qq{
           INSERT INTO people (fullname, age) VALUES (?, ?)
         });
         $sth-&gt;execute("Joe Bloggs", undef);

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(qq{
           UPDATE people SET age = ? WHERE fullname = ?
         });
         $sth-&gt;execute(undef, "Joe Bloggs");

       However, care must be taken when trying to use NULL values in a "WHERE" clause.  Consider:

         SELECT fullname FROM people WHERE age = ?

       Binding an "undef" (NULL) to the placeholder will <u>not</u> select rows which have a NULL "age"!  At least for
       database engines that conform to the SQL standard.  Refer to the SQL manual for your database engine or
       any SQL book for the reasons for this.  To explicitly select NULLs you have to say ""WHERE age IS NULL"".

       A common issue is to have a code fragment handle a value that could be either "defined" or "undef" (non-
       NULL or NULL) at runtime.  A simple technique is to prepare the appropriate statement as needed, and
       substitute the placeholder for non-NULL cases:

         $sql_clause = defined $age? "age = ?" : "age IS NULL";
         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(qq{
           SELECT fullname FROM people WHERE $sql_clause
         });
         $sth-&gt;execute(defined $age ? $age : ());

       The following technique illustrates qualifying a "WHERE" clause with several columns, whose associated
       values ("defined" or "undef") are in a hash %h:

         for my $col ("age", "phone", "email") {
           if (defined $h{$col}) {
             push @sql_qual, "$col = ?";
             push @sql_bind, $h{$col};
           }
           else {
             push @sql_qual, "$col IS NULL";
           }
         }
         $sql_clause = join(" AND ", @sql_qual);
         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(qq{
             SELECT fullname FROM people WHERE $sql_clause
         });
         $sth-&gt;execute(@sql_bind);

       The techniques above call prepare for the SQL statement with each call to execute.  Because calls to
       <b>prepare()</b> can be expensive, performance can suffer when an application iterates many times over
       statements like the above.

       A better solution is a single "WHERE" clause that supports both NULL and non-NULL comparisons.  Its SQL
       statement would need to be prepared only once for all cases, thus improving performance.  Several
       examples of "WHERE" clauses that support this are presented below.  But each example lacks portability,
       robustness, or simplicity.  Whether an example is supported on your database engine depends on what SQL
       extensions it provides, and where it supports the "?"  placeholder in a statement.

         0)  age = ?
         1)  NVL(age, xx) = NVL(?, xx)
         2)  ISNULL(age, xx) = ISNULL(?, xx)
         3)  DECODE(age, ?, 1, 0) = 1
         4)  age = ? OR (age IS NULL AND ? IS NULL)
         5)  age = ? OR (age IS NULL AND SP_ISNULL(?) = 1)
         6)  age = ? OR (age IS NULL AND ? = 1)

       Statements formed with the above "WHERE" clauses require execute statements as follows.  The arguments
       are required, whether their values are "defined" or "undef".

         0,1,2,3)  $sth-&gt;execute($age);
         4,5)      $sth-&gt;execute($age, $age);
         6)        $sth-&gt;execute($age, defined($age) ? 0 : 1);

       Example 0 should not work (as mentioned earlier), but may work on a few database engines anyway (e.g.
       Sybase).  Example 0 is part of examples 4, 5, and 6, so if example 0 works, these other examples may
       work, even if the engine does not properly support the right hand side of the "OR" expression.

       Examples 1 and 2 are not robust: they require that you provide a valid column value xx (e.g. '~') which
       is not present in any row.  That means you must have some notion of what data won't be stored in the
       column, and expect clients to adhere to that.

       Example 5 requires that you provide a stored procedure (SP_ISNULL in this example) that acts as a
       function: it checks whether a value is null, and returns 1 if it is, or 0 if not.

       Example 6, the least simple, is probably the most portable, i.e., it should work with most, if not all,
       database engines.

       Here is a table that indicates which examples above are known to work on various database engines:

                          -----Examples------
                          0  1  2  3  4  5  6
                          -  -  -  -  -  -  -

       DBI provides a sample perl script that will test the examples above on your database engine and tell you
       which ones work.  It is located in the <u>ex/</u> subdirectory of the DBI source distribution, or here:
       &lt;https://github.com/perl5-dbi/dbi/blob/master/ex/perl_dbi_nulls_test.pl&gt; Please use the script to help us
       fill-in and maintain this table.

       <b>Performance</b>

       Without using placeholders, the insert statement shown previously would have to contain the literal
       values to be inserted and would have to be re-prepared and re-executed for each row. With placeholders,
       the insert statement only needs to be prepared once. The bind values for each row can be given to the
       "execute" method each time it's called. By avoiding the need to re-prepare the statement for each row,
       the application typically runs many times faster. Here's an example:

         my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(q{
           INSERT INTO sales (product_code, qty, price) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
         }) or die $dbh-&gt;errstr;
         while (&lt;&gt;) {
             chomp;
             my ($product_code, $qty, $price) = split /,/;
             $sth-&gt;execute($product_code, $qty, $price) or die $dbh-&gt;errstr;
         }
         $dbh-&gt;commit or die $dbh-&gt;errstr;

       See "execute" and "bind_param" for more details.

       The "q{...}" style quoting used in this example avoids clashing with quotes that may be used in the SQL
       statement. Use the double-quote like "qq{...}" operator if you want to interpolate variables into the
       string.  See "Quote and Quote-like Operators" in perlop for more details.

       See also the "bind_columns" method, which is used to associate Perl variables with the output columns of
       a "SELECT" statement.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>PACKAGE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CLASS</b></h4><pre>
       In this section, we cover the DBI class methods, utility functions, and the dynamic attributes associated
       with generic DBI handles.

   <b>DBI</b> <b>Constants</b>
       Constants representing the values of the SQL standard types can be imported individually by name, or all
       together by importing the special ":sql_types" tag.

       The names and values of all the defined SQL standard types can be produced like this:

         foreach (@{ $DBI::EXPORT_TAGS{sql_types} }) {
           printf "%s=%d\n", $_, &amp;{"DBI::$_"};
         }

       These constants are defined by SQL/CLI, ODBC or both.  "SQL_BIGINT" has conflicting codes in SQL/CLI and
       ODBC, DBI uses the ODBC one.

       See the "type_info", "type_info_all", and "bind_param" methods for possible uses.

       Note that just because the DBI defines a named constant for a given data type doesn't mean that drivers
       will support that data type.

   <b>DBI</b> <b>Class</b> <b>Methods</b>
       The following methods are provided by the DBI class:

       <u>"parse_dsn"</u>

         ($scheme, $driver, $attr_string, $attr_hash, $driver_dsn) = DBI-&gt;parse_dsn($dsn)
             or die "Can't parse DBI DSN '$dsn'";

       Breaks apart a DBI Data Source Name (DSN) and returns the individual parts. If $dsn doesn't contain a
       valid DSN then <b>parse_dsn()</b> returns an empty list.

       $scheme is the first part of the DSN and is currently always 'dbi'.  $driver is the driver name, possibly
       defaulted to $ENV{DBI_DRIVER}, and may be undefined.  $attr_string is the contents of the optional
       attribute string, which may be undefined.  If $attr_string is not empty then $attr_hash is a reference to
       a hash containing the parsed attribute names and values.  $driver_dsn is the last part of the DBI DSN
       string. For example:

         ($scheme, $driver, $attr_string, $attr_hash, $driver_dsn)
             = DBI-&gt;parse_dsn("dbi:MyDriver(RaiseError=&gt;1):db=test;port=42");
         $scheme      = 'dbi';
         $driver      = 'MyDriver';
         $attr_string = 'RaiseError=&gt;1';
         $attr_hash   = { 'RaiseError' =&gt; '1' };
         $driver_dsn  = 'db=test;port=42';

       The <b>parse_dsn()</b> method was added in DBI 1.43.

       <u>"connect"</u>

         $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect($data_source, $username, $password)
                   or die $DBI::errstr;
         $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect($data_source, $username, $password, \%attr)
                   or die $DBI::errstr;

       Establishes a database connection, or session, to the requested $data_source.  Returns a database handle
       object if the connection succeeds. Use "$dbh-&gt;disconnect" to terminate the connection.

       If the connect fails (see below), it returns "undef" and sets both $DBI::err and $DBI::errstr. (It does
       <u>not</u> explicitly set $!.) You should generally test the return status of "connect" and "print $DBI::errstr"
       if it has failed.

       Multiple simultaneous connections to multiple databases through multiple drivers can be made via the DBI.
       Simply make one "connect" call for each database and keep a copy of each returned database handle.

       The $data_source value must begin with ""dbi:"<u>driver_name</u>":"".  The <u>driver_name</u> specifies the driver that
       will be used to make the connection. (Letter case is significant.)

       As a convenience, if the $data_source parameter is undefined or empty, the DBI will substitute the value
       of the environment variable "DBI_DSN".  If just the <u>driver_name</u> part is empty (i.e., the $data_source
       prefix is ""dbi::""), the environment variable "DBI_DRIVER" is used. If neither variable is set, then
       "connect" dies.

       Examples of $data_source values are:

         dbi:DriverName:database_name
         dbi:DriverName:database_name@hostname:port
         dbi:DriverName:database=database_name;host=hostname;port=port

       There is <u>no</u> <u>standard</u> for the text following the driver name. Each driver is free to use whatever syntax
       it wants. The only requirement the DBI makes is that all the information is supplied in a single string.
       You must consult the documentation for the drivers you are using for a description of the syntax they
       require.

       It is recommended that drivers support the ODBC style, shown in the last example above. It is also
       recommended that they support the three common names '"host"', '"port"', and '"database"' (plus '"db"' as
       an alias for "database"). This simplifies automatic construction of basic DSNs:
       "dbi:$driver:database=$db;host=$host;port=$port".  Drivers should aim to 'do something reasonable' when
       given a DSN in this form, but if any part is meaningless for that driver (such as 'port' for Informix) it
       should generate an error if that part is not empty.

       If the environment variable "DBI_AUTOPROXY" is defined (and the driver in $data_source is not ""Proxy"")
       then the connect request will automatically be changed to:

         $ENV{DBI_AUTOPROXY};dsn=$data_source

       "DBI_AUTOPROXY" is typically set as ""dbi:Proxy:hostname=...;port=..."".  If $ENV{DBI_AUTOPROXY} doesn't
       begin with '"dbi:"' then "dbi:Proxy:" will be prepended to it first.  See the DBD::Proxy documentation
       for more details.

       If $username or $password are undefined (rather than just empty), then the DBI will substitute the values
       of the "DBI_USER" and "DBI_PASS" environment variables, respectively.  The DBI will warn if the
       environment variables are not defined.  However, the everyday use of these environment variables is not
       recommended for security reasons. The mechanism is primarily intended to simplify testing.  See below for
       alternative way to specify the username and password.

       "DBI-&gt;connect" automatically installs the driver if it has not been installed yet. Driver installation
       either returns a valid driver handle, or it <u>dies</u> with an error message that includes the string
       ""install_driver"" and the underlying problem. So "DBI-&gt;connect" will die on a driver installation
       failure and will only return "undef" on a connect failure, in which case $DBI::errstr will hold the error
       message.  Use "eval" if you need to catch the ""install_driver"" error.

       The $data_source argument (with the ""dbi:...:"" prefix removed) and the $username and $password
       arguments are then passed to the driver for processing. The DBI does not define any interpretation for
       the contents of these fields.  The driver is free to interpret the $data_source, $username, and $password
       fields in any way, and supply whatever defaults are appropriate for the engine being accessed.  (Oracle,
       for example, uses the ORACLE_SID and TWO_TASK environment variables if no $data_source is specified.)

       The "AutoCommit" and "PrintError" attributes for each connection default to "on". (See "AutoCommit" and
       "PrintError" for more information.)  However, it is strongly recommended that you explicitly define
       "AutoCommit" rather than rely on the default. The "PrintWarn" attribute defaults to true.  The
       "RaiseWarn" attribute defaults to false.

       The "\%attr" parameter can be used to alter the default settings of "PrintError", "RaiseError",
       "AutoCommit", and other attributes. For example:

         $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect($data_source, $user, $pass, {
               PrintError =&gt; 0,
               AutoCommit =&gt; 0
         });

       The username and password can also be specified using the attributes "Username" and "Password", in which
       case they take precedence over the $username and $password parameters.

       You can also define connection attribute values within the $data_source parameter. For example:

         dbi:DriverName(PrintWarn=&gt;0,PrintError=&gt;0,Taint=&gt;1):...

       Individual attributes values specified in this way take precedence over any conflicting values specified
       via the "\%attr" parameter to "connect".

       The "dbi_connect_method" attribute can be used to specify which driver method should be called to
       establish the connection. The only useful values are 'connect', 'connect_cached', or some specialized
       case like 'Apache::DBI::connect' (which is automatically the default when running within Apache).

       Where possible, each session ($dbh) is independent from the transactions in other sessions. This is
       useful when you need to hold cursors open across transactions--for example, if you use one session for
       your long lifespan cursors (typically read-only) and another for your short update transactions.

       For compatibility with old DBI scripts, the driver can be specified by passing its name as the fourth
       argument to "connect" (instead of "\%attr"):

         $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect($data_source, $user, $pass, $driver);

       In this "old-style" form of "connect", the $data_source should not start with ""dbi:driver_name:"". (If
       it does, the embedded driver_name will be ignored). Also note that in this older form of "connect", the
       "$dbh-&gt;{AutoCommit}" attribute is <u>undefined</u>, the "$dbh-&gt;{PrintError}" attribute is off, and the old
       "DBI_DBNAME" environment variable is checked if "DBI_DSN" is not defined. Beware that this "old-style"
       "connect" will soon be withdrawn in a future version of DBI.

       <u>"connect_cached"</u>

         $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect_cached($data_source, $username, $password)
                   or die $DBI::errstr;
         $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect_cached($data_source, $username, $password, \%attr)
                   or die $DBI::errstr;

       "connect_cached" is like "connect", except that the database handle returned is also stored in a hash
       associated with the given parameters. If another call is made to "connect_cached" with the same parameter
       values, then the corresponding cached $dbh will be returned if it is still valid.  The cached database
       handle is replaced with a new connection if it has been disconnected or if the "ping" method fails.

       Note that the behaviour of this method differs in several respects from the behaviour of persistent
       connections implemented by Apache::DBI.  However, if Apache::DBI is loaded then "connect_cached" will use
       it.

       Caching connections can be useful in some applications, but it can also cause problems, such as too many
       connections, and so should be used with care. In particular, avoid changing the attributes of a database
       handle created via <b>connect_cached()</b> because it will affect other code that may be using the same handle.
       When <b>connect_cached()</b> returns a handle the attributes will be reset to their initial values.  This can
       cause problems, especially with the "AutoCommit" attribute.

       Also, to ensure that the attributes passed are always the same, avoid passing references inline. For
       example, the "Callbacks" attribute is specified as a hash reference. Be sure to declare it external to
       the call to <b>connect_cached()</b>, such that the hash reference is not re-created on every call. A package-
       level lexical works well:

         package MyDBH;
         my $cb = {
             'connect_cached.reused' =&gt; sub { delete $_[4]-&gt;{AutoCommit} },
         };

         sub dbh {
             DBI-&gt;connect_cached( $dsn, $username, $auth, { Callbacks =&gt; $cb });
         }

       Where multiple separate parts of a program are using <b>connect_cached()</b> to connect to the same database
       with the same (initial) attributes it is a good idea to add a private attribute to the <b>connect_cached()</b>
       call to effectively limit the scope of the caching. For example:

         DBI-&gt;connect_cached(..., { private_foo_cachekey =&gt; "Bar", ... });

       Handles returned from that <b>connect_cached()</b> call will only be returned by other <b>connect_cached()</b> call
       elsewhere in the code if those other calls also pass in the same attribute values, including the private
       one.  (I've used "private_foo_cachekey" here as an example, you can use any attribute name with a
       "private_" prefix.)

       Taking that one step further, you can limit a particular <b>connect_cached()</b> call to return handles unique
       to that one place in the code by setting the private attribute to a unique value for that place:

         DBI-&gt;connect_cached(..., { private_foo_cachekey =&gt; __FILE__.__LINE__, ... });

       By using a private attribute you still get connection caching for the individual calls to
       <b>connect_cached()</b> but, by making separate database connections for separate parts of the code, the
       database handles are isolated from any attribute changes made to other handles.

       The cache can be accessed (and cleared) via the "CachedKids" attribute:

         my $CachedKids_hashref = $dbh-&gt;{Driver}-&gt;{CachedKids};
         %$CachedKids_hashref = () if $CachedKids_hashref;

       <u>"available_drivers"</u>

         @ary = DBI-&gt;available_drivers;
         @ary = DBI-&gt;available_drivers($quiet);

       Returns a list of all available drivers by searching for "DBD::*" modules through the directories in
       @INC. By default, a warning is given if some drivers are hidden by others of the same name in earlier
       directories. Passing a true value for $quiet will inhibit the warning.

       <u>"installed_drivers"</u>

         %drivers = DBI-&gt;installed_drivers();

       Returns a list of driver name and driver handle pairs for all drivers 'installed' (loaded) into the
       current process.  The driver name does not include the 'DBD::' prefix.

       To get a list of all drivers available in your perl installation you can use "available_drivers".

       Added in DBI 1.49.

       <u>"installed_versions"</u>

         DBI-&gt;installed_versions;
         @ary  = DBI-&gt;installed_versions;
         $hash = DBI-&gt;installed_versions;

       Calls <b>available_drivers()</b> and attempts to load each of them in turn using <b>install_driver()</b>.  For each
       load that succeeds the driver name and version number are added to a hash. When running under
       DBI::PurePerl drivers which appear not be pure-perl are ignored.

       When called in array context the list of successfully loaded drivers is returned (without the 'DBD::'
       prefix).

       When called in scalar context an extra entry for the "DBI" is added (and "DBI::PurePerl" if appropriate)
       and a reference to the hash is returned.

       When called in a void context the <b>installed_versions()</b> method will print out a formatted list of the hash
       contents, one per line, along with some other information about the DBI version and OS.

       Due to the potentially high memory cost and unknown risks of loading in an unknown number of drivers that
       just happen to be installed on the system, this method is not recommended for general use.  Use
       <b>available_drivers()</b> instead.

       The <b>installed_versions()</b> method is primarily intended as a quick way to see from the command line what's
       installed. For example:

         perl -MDBI -e 'DBI-&gt;installed_versions'

       The <b>installed_versions()</b> method was added in DBI 1.38.

       <u>"data_sources"</u>

         @ary = DBI-&gt;data_sources($driver);
         @ary = DBI-&gt;data_sources($driver, \%attr);

       Returns a list of data sources (databases) available via the named driver.  If $driver is empty or
       "undef", then the value of the "DBI_DRIVER" environment variable is used.

       The driver will be loaded if it hasn't been already. Note that if the driver loading fails then
       <b>data_sources()</b> <u>dies</u> with an error message that includes the string ""install_driver"" and the underlying
       problem.

       Data sources are returned in a form suitable for passing to the "connect" method (that is, they will
       include the ""dbi:$driver:"" prefix).

       Note that many drivers have no way of knowing what data sources might be available for it. These drivers
       return an empty or incomplete list or may require driver-specific attributes.

       There is also a <b>data_sources()</b> method defined for database handles.

       <u>"trace"</u>

         DBI-&gt;trace($trace_setting)
         DBI-&gt;trace($trace_setting, $trace_filename)
         DBI-&gt;trace($trace_setting, $trace_filehandle)
         $trace_setting = DBI-&gt;trace;

       The "DBI-&gt;trace" method sets the <u>global</u> <u>default</u> trace settings and returns the <u>previous</u> trace settings.
       It can also be used to change where the trace output is sent.

       There's a similar method, "$h-&gt;trace", which sets the trace settings for the specific handle it's called
       on.

       See the "TRACING" section for full details about the DBI's powerful tracing facilities.

       <u>"visit_handles"</u>

         DBI-&gt;visit_handles( $coderef );
         DBI-&gt;visit_handles( $coderef, $info );

       Where $coderef is a reference to a subroutine and $info is an arbitrary value which, if undefined,
       defaults to a reference to an empty hash. Returns $info.

       For each installed driver handle, if any, $coderef is invoked as:

         $coderef-&gt;($driver_handle, $info);

       If the execution of $coderef returns a true value then "visit_child_handles" is called on that child
       handle and passed the returned value as $info.

       For example:

   <b>DBI</b> <b>Utility</b> <b>Functions</b>
       In addition to the DBI methods listed in the previous section, the DBI package also provides several
       utility functions.

       These can be imported into your code by listing them in the "use" statement. For example:

         use DBI qw(neat data_diff);

       Alternatively, all these utility functions (except hash) can be imported using the ":utils" import tag.
       For example:

         use DBI qw(:utils);

       <u>"data_string_desc"</u>

         $description = data_string_desc($string);

       Returns an informal description of the string. For example:

         UTF8 off, ASCII, 42 characters 42 bytes
         UTF8 off, non-ASCII, 42 characters 42 bytes
         UTF8 on, non-ASCII, 4 characters 6 bytes
         UTF8 on but INVALID encoding, non-ASCII, 4 characters 6 bytes
         UTF8 off, undef

       The initial "UTF8" on/off refers to Perl's internal SvUTF8 flag.  If $string has the SvUTF8 flag set but
       the sequence of bytes it contains are not a valid UTF-8 encoding then <b>data_string_desc()</b> will report
       "UTF8 on but INVALID encoding".

       The "ASCII" vs "non-ASCII" portion shows "ASCII" if <u>all</u> the characters in the string are ASCII (have code
       points &lt;= 127).

       The <b>data_string_desc()</b> function was added in DBI 1.46.

       <u>"data_string_diff"</u>

         $diff = data_string_diff($a, $b);

       Returns an informal description of the first character difference between the strings. If both $a and $b
       contain the same sequence of characters then <b>data_string_diff()</b> returns an empty string.  For example:

        Params a &amp; b     Result
        ------------     ------
        'aaa', 'aaa'     ''
        'aaa', 'abc'     'Strings differ at index 2: a[2]=a, b[2]=b'
        'aaa', undef     'String b is undef, string a has 3 characters'
        'aaa', 'aa'      'String b truncated after 2 characters'

       Unicode characters are reported in "\x{XXXX}" format. Unicode code points in the range U+0800 to U+08FF
       are unassigned and most likely to occur due to double-encoding. Characters in this range are reported as
       "\x{08XX}='C'" where "C" is the corresponding latin-1 character.

       The <b>data_string_diff()</b> function only considers logical <u>characters</u> and not the underlying encoding. See
       "data_diff" for an alternative.

       The <b>data_string_diff()</b> function was added in DBI 1.46.

       <u>"data_diff"</u>

         $diff = data_diff($a, $b);
         $diff = data_diff($a, $b, $logical);

       Returns an informal description of the difference between two strings.  It calls "data_string_desc" and
       "data_string_diff" and returns the combined results as a multi-line string.

       For example, "data_diff("abc", "ab\x{263a}")" will return:

         a: UTF8 off, ASCII, 3 characters 3 bytes
         b: UTF8 on, non-ASCII, 3 characters 5 bytes
         Strings differ at index 2: a[2]=c, b[2]=\x{263A}

       If $a and $b are identical in both the characters they contain <u>and</u> their physical encoding then
       <b>data_diff()</b> returns an empty string.  If $logical is true then physical encoding differences are ignored
       (but are still reported if there is a difference in the characters).

       The <b>data_diff()</b> function was added in DBI 1.46.

       <u>"neat"</u>

         $str = neat($value);
         $str = neat($value, $maxlen);

       Return a string containing a neat (and tidy) representation of the supplied value.

       Strings will be quoted, although internal quotes will <u>not</u> be escaped.  Values known to be numeric will be
       unquoted. Undefined (NULL) values will be shown as "undef" (without quotes).

       If the string is flagged internally as utf8 then double quotes will be used, otherwise single quotes are
       used and unprintable characters will be replaced by dot (.).

       For result strings longer than $maxlen the result string will be truncated to "$maxlen-4" and ""...'""
       will be appended.  If $maxlen is 0 or "undef", it defaults to $DBI::neat_maxlen which, in turn, defaults
       to 400.

       This function is designed to format values for human consumption.  It is used internally by the DBI for
       "trace" output. It should typically <u>not</u> be used for formatting values for database use.  (See also
       "quote".)

       <u>"neat_list"</u>

         $str = neat_list(\@listref, $maxlen, $field_sep);

       Calls "neat" on each element of the list and returns a string containing the results joined with
       $field_sep. $field_sep defaults to ", ".

       <u>"looks_like_number"</u>

         @bool = looks_like_number(@array);

       Returns true for each element that looks like a number.  Returns false for each element that does not
       look like a number.  Returns "undef" for each element that is undefined or empty.

       <u>"hash"</u>

         $hash_value = DBI::hash($buffer, $type);

       Return a 32-bit integer 'hash' value corresponding to the contents of $buffer.  The $type parameter
       selects which kind of hash algorithm should be used.

       For the technically curious, type 0 (which is the default if $type isn't specified) is based on the Perl
       5.1 hash except that the value is forced to be negative (for obscure historical reasons).  Type 1 is the
       better "Fowler / Noll / Vo" (FNV) hash. See &lt;<a href="http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/fnv/">http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/fnv/</a>&gt; for more
       information.  Both types are implemented in C and are very fast.

       This function doesn't have much to do with databases, except that it can sometimes be handy to store such
       values in a database.  It also doesn't have much to do with perl hashes, like %foo.

       <u>"sql_type_cast"</u>

         $sts = DBI::sql_type_cast($sv, $sql_type, $flags);

       sql_type_cast attempts to cast $sv to the SQL type (see DBI Constants) specified in $sql_type. At present
       only the SQL types "SQL_INTEGER", "SQL_DOUBLE" and "SQL_NUMERIC" are supported.

       For "SQL_INTEGER" the effect is similar to using the value in an expression that requires an integer. It
       gives the perl scalar an 'integer aspect'.  (Technically the value gains an IV, or possibly a UV or NV if
       the value is too large for an IV.)

       For "SQL_DOUBLE" the effect is similar to using the value in an expression that requires a general
       numeric value. It gives the perl scalar a 'numeric aspect'.  (Technically the value gains an NV.)

       "SQL_NUMERIC" is similar to "SQL_INTEGER" or "SQL_DOUBLE" but more general and more cautious.  It will
       look at the string first and if it looks like an integer (that will fit in an IV or UV) it will act like
       "SQL_INTEGER", if it looks like a floating point value it will act like "SQL_DOUBLE", if it looks like
       neither then it will do nothing - and thereby avoid the warnings that would be generated by "SQL_INTEGER"
       and "SQL_DOUBLE" when given non-numeric data.

       $flags may be:

       "DBIstcf_DISCARD_STRING"
           If  this  flag  is  specified then when the driver successfully casts the bound perl scalar to a non-
           string type then the string portion of the scalar will be discarded.

       "DBIstcf_STRICT"
           If $sv cannot be cast to the requested $sql_type then by default it is left untouched and no error is
           generated. If you specify "DBIstcf_STRICT" and the cast fails, this will generate an error.

       The returned $sts value is:

         -2 sql_type is not handled
         -1 sv is undef so unchanged
          0 sv could not be cast cleanly and DBIstcf_STRICT was used
          1 sv could not be cast and DBIstcf_STRICT was not used
          2 sv was cast successfully

       This method is exported by the :utils tag and was introduced in DBI 1.611.

   <b>DBI</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Attributes</b>
       Dynamic attributes are always associated with the <u>last</u> <u>handle</u> <u>used</u> (that handle is represented by  $h  in
       the descriptions below).

       Where  an  attribute  is  equivalent  to  a  method  call,  then refer to the method call for all related
       documentation.

       Warning: these attributes are provided as a convenience but they do have limitations. Specifically,  they
       have  a  short  lifespan: because they are associated with the last handle used, they should only be used
       <u>immediately</u> after calling the method that "sets" them.  If in any doubt,  use  the  corresponding  method
       call.

       <u>$DBI::err</u>

       Equivalent to "$h-&gt;err".

       <u>$DBI::errstr</u>

       Equivalent to "$h-&gt;errstr".

       <u>$DBI::state</u>

       Equivalent to "$h-&gt;state".

       <u>$DBI::rows</u>

       Equivalent to "$h-&gt;rows". Please refer to the documentation for the "rows" method.

       <u>$DBI::lasth</u>

       Returns  the DBI object handle used for the most recent DBI method call.  If the last DBI method call was
       a DESTROY then $DBI::lasth will return the handle of the parent of the destroyed handle, if there is one.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b> <b>COMMON</b> <b>TO</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>HANDLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods can be used by all types of DBI handles.

       <u>"err"</u>

         $rv = $h-&gt;err;

       Returns the <u>native</u> database engine error code from the last driver method called. The code  is  typically
       an integer but you should not assume that.

       The  DBI  resets  $h-&gt;err  to  undef  before  almost  all DBI method calls, so the value only has a short
       lifespan. Also, for most drivers, the statement handles share the  same  error  variable  as  the  parent
       database handle, so calling a method on one handle may reset the error on the related handles.

       (Methods  which  don't  reset  err  before  being  called include <b>err()</b> and <b>errstr()</b>, obviously, <b>state()</b>,
       <b>rows()</b>, <b>func()</b>, <b>trace()</b>, <b>trace_msg()</b>, <b>ping()</b>, and the tied hash attribute <b>FETCH()</b> and <b>STORE()</b> methods.)

       If you need to test for specific error conditions <u>and</u> have your program be portable to different database
       engines, then you'll need to determine what the corresponding error codes are for all those  engines  and
       test for all of them.

       The  DBI  uses  the value of $DBI::stderr as the "err" value for internal errors.  Drivers should also do
       likewise.  The default value for $DBI::stderr is 2000000000.

       A driver may return 0 from <b>err()</b> to indicate a warning condition after a method call. Similarly, a driver
       may return an empty string to indicate a 'success with information' condition. In both  these  cases  the
       value  is false but not undef. The <b>errstr()</b> and <b>state()</b> methods may be used to retrieve extra information
       in these cases.

       See "set_err" for more information.

       <u>"errstr"</u>

         $str = $h-&gt;errstr;

       Returns the native database engine error message from the last DBI  method  called.  This  has  the  same
       lifespan issues as the "err" method described above.

       The returned string may contain multiple messages separated by newline characters.

       The <b>errstr()</b> method should not be used to test for errors, use <b>err()</b> for that, because drivers may return
       'success with information' or warning messages via <b>errstr()</b> for methods that have not 'failed'.

       See "set_err" for more information.

       <u>"state"</u>

         $str = $h-&gt;state;

       Returns a state code in the standard SQLSTATE five character format.  Note that the specific success code
       00000  is  translated  to  any  empty  string  (false). If the driver does not support SQLSTATE (and most
       don't), then <b>state()</b> will return "S1000" (General Error) for all errors.

       The driver is free to return any value via "state", e.g., warning codes, even if it has not  declared  an
       error by returning a true value via the "err" method described above.

       The  <b>state()</b> method should not be used to test for errors, use <b>err()</b> for that, because drivers may return
       a 'success with information' or warning state code via <b>state()</b> for methods that have not 'failed'.

       <u>"set_err"</u>

         $rv = $h-&gt;set_err($err, $errstr);
         $rv = $h-&gt;set_err($err, $errstr, $state);
         $rv = $h-&gt;set_err($err, $errstr, $state, $method);
         $rv = $h-&gt;set_err($err, $errstr, $state, $method, $rv);

       Set the "err", "errstr", and "state" values for the handle.  This method is typically only  used  by  DBI
       drivers and DBI subclasses.

       If  the "HandleSetErr" attribute holds a reference to a subroutine it is called first. The subroutine can
       alter the $err, $errstr, $state, and $method  values.  See  "HandleSetErr"  for  full  details.   If  the
       subroutine  returns  a true value then the handle "err", "errstr", and "state" values are not altered and
       <b>set_err()</b> returns an empty list (it normally returns $rv which defaults to undef, see below).

       Setting "err" to a <u>true</u> value indicates  an  error  and  will  trigger  the  normal  DBI  error  handling
       mechanisms,  such as "RaiseError" and "HandleError", if they are enabled, when execution returns from the
       DBI back to the application.

       Setting "err" to "" indicates an 'information' state, and setting it to "0" indicates a 'warning'  state.
       Setting  "err"  to  "undef" also sets "errstr" to undef, and "state" to "", irrespective of the values of
       the $errstr and $state parameters.

       The     $method     parameter     provides      an      alternate      method      name      for      the
       "RaiseError"/"PrintError"/"RaiseWarn"/"PrintWarn"   error   string   instead   of  the  fairly  unhelpful
       '"set_err"'.

       The "set_err" method normally returns undef.  The $rv parameter provides an alternate return value.

       Some special rules apply if the "err" or "errstr" values for the handle are <u>already</u> set...

       If "errstr" is true then: "" [err was %s now %s]"" is appended if $err is true and "err" is already  true
       and  the new err value differs from the original one. Similarly "" [state was %s now %s]"" is appended if
       $state is true and "state" is already true and the new state value differs from the original one. Finally
       ""\n"" and the new $errstr are appended if $errstr differs from the existing errstr value. Obviously  the
       %s's above are replaced by the corresponding values.

       The  handle  "err"  value  is  set  to  $err if: $err is true; or handle "err" value is undef; or $err is
       defined and the length is greater than the handle "err" length. The effect is that an 'information' state
       only overrides undef; a 'warning' overrides undef  or  'information',  and  an  'error'  state  overrides
       anything.

       The  handle  "state"  value is set to $state if $state is true and the handle "err" value was set (by the
       rules above).

       Support for warning and information states was added in DBI 1.41.

       <u>"trace"</u>

         $h-&gt;trace($trace_settings);
         $h-&gt;trace($trace_settings, $trace_filename);
         $trace_settings = $h-&gt;trace;

       The <b>trace()</b> method is used to alter the trace settings for a handle (and  any  future  children  of  that
       handle).  It can also be used to change where the trace output is sent.

       There's a similar method, "DBI-&gt;trace", which sets the global default trace settings.

       See the "TRACING" section for full details about the DBI's powerful tracing facilities.

       <u>"trace_msg"</u>

         $h-&gt;trace_msg($message_text);
         $h-&gt;trace_msg($message_text, $min_level);

       Writes  $message_text  to the trace file if the trace level is greater than or equal to $min_level (which
       defaults to 1).  Can also be called as "DBI-&gt;trace_msg($msg)".

       See "TRACING" for more details.

       <u>"func"</u>

         $h-&gt;func(@func_arguments, $func_name) or die ...;

       The "func" method can be used to call private non-standard and non-portable methods  implemented  by  the
       driver. Note that the function name is given as the <u>last</u> argument.

       It's  also  important to note that the <b>func()</b> method does not clear a previous error ($DBI::err etc.) and
       it does not trigger automatic error detection (RaiseError etc.) so  you  must  check  the  return  status
       and/or $h-&gt;err to detect errors.

       (This  method  is  not  directly  related  to  calling  stored  procedures.  Calling stored procedures is
       currently not defined by the DBI.  Some drivers, such as DBD::Oracle, support it  in  non-portable  ways.
       See driver documentation for more details.)

       See  also <b>install_method()</b> in DBI::DBD for how you can avoid needing to use <b>func()</b> and gain direct access
       to driver-private methods.

       <u>"can"</u>

         $is_implemented = $h-&gt;can($method_name);

       Returns true if $method_name is implemented by the driver or a default method is provided  by  the  DBI's
       driver base class.  It returns false where a driver hasn't implemented a method and the default method is
       provided by the DBI's driver base class is just an empty stub.

       <u>"parse_trace_flags"</u>

         $trace_settings_integer = $h-&gt;parse_trace_flags($trace_settings);

       Parses  a string containing trace settings and returns the corresponding integer value used internally by
       the DBI and drivers.

       The $trace_settings argument is a string containing a trace level between 0  and  15  and/or  trace  flag
       names separated by vertical bar (""|"") or comma ("","") characters. For example: "SQL|3|foo".

       It uses the <b>parse_trace_flag()</b> method, described below, to process the individual trace flag names.

       The <b>parse_trace_flags()</b> method was added in DBI 1.42.

       <u>"parse_trace_flag"</u>

         $bit_flag = $h-&gt;parse_trace_flag($trace_flag_name);

       Returns  the  bit flag corresponding to the trace flag name in $trace_flag_name.  Drivers are expected to
       override this method and check if $trace_flag_name is a driver specific trace flags  and,  if  not,  then
       call the DBI's default <b>parse_trace_flag()</b>.

       The <b>parse_trace_flag()</b> method was added in DBI 1.42.

       <u>"private_attribute_info"</u>

         $hash_ref = $h-&gt;private_attribute_info();

       Returns  a reference to a hash whose keys are the names of driver-private handle attributes available for
       the kind of handle (driver, database, statement) that the method was called on.

       For example, the return value when called with a DBD::Sybase $dbh could look like this:

         {
             syb_dynamic_supported =&gt; undef,
             syb_oc_version =&gt; undef,
             syb_server_version =&gt; undef,
             syb_server_version_string =&gt; undef,
         }

       and when called with a DBD::Sybase $sth they could look like this:

         {
             syb_types =&gt; undef,
             syb_proc_status =&gt; undef,
             syb_result_type =&gt; undef,
         }

       The values should be undef. Meanings may be assigned to particular values in future.

       <u>"swap_inner_handle"</u>

         $rc = $h1-&gt;swap_inner_handle( $h2 );
         $rc = $h1-&gt;swap_inner_handle( $h2, $allow_reparent );

       Brain transplants for handles. You don't need to know about this unless  you  want  to  become  a  handle
       surgeon.

       A  DBI  handle  is  a  reference  to  a  tied hash. A tied hash has an <u>inner</u> hash that actually holds the
       contents.  The <b>swap_inner_handle()</b> method swaps the inner hashes between two handles.  The  $h1  and  $h2
       handles  still  point  to  the  same tied hashes, but what those hashes are tied to has been swapped.  In
       effect $h1 <u>becomes</u> $h2 and vice-versa. This is powerful stuff, expect problems. Use with care.

       As a small safety measure, the  two  handles,  $h1  and  $h2,  have  to  share  the  same  parent  unless
       $allow_reparent is true.

       The <b>swap_inner_handle()</b> method was added in DBI 1.44.

       Here's a quick kind of 'diagram' as a worked example to help think about what's happening:

           Original state:
                   dbh1o -&gt; dbh1i
                   sthAo -&gt; sthAi(dbh1i)
                   dbh2o -&gt; dbh2i

           swap_inner_handle dbh1o with dbh2o:
                   dbh2o -&gt; dbh1i
                   sthAo -&gt; sthAi(dbh1i)
                   dbh1o -&gt; dbh2i

           create new sth from dbh1o:
                   dbh2o -&gt; dbh1i
                   sthAo -&gt; sthAi(dbh1i)
                   dbh1o -&gt; dbh2i
                   sthBo -&gt; sthBi(dbh2i)

           swap_inner_handle sthAo with sthBo:
                   dbh2o -&gt; dbh1i
                   sthBo -&gt; sthAi(dbh1i)

       <u>"visit_child_handles"</u>

         $h-&gt;visit_child_handles( $coderef );
         $h-&gt;visit_child_handles( $coderef, $info );

       Where  $coderef  is  a  reference  to  a  subroutine and $info is an arbitrary value which, if undefined,
       defaults to a reference to an empty hash. Returns $info.

       For each child handle of $h, if any, $coderef is invoked as:

         $coderef-&gt;($child_handle, $info);

       If the execution of $coderef returns a true value then "visit_child_handles"  is  called  on  that  child
       handle and passed the returned value as $info.

       For example:

         # count database connections with names (DSN) matching a pattern
         my $connections = 0;
         $dbh-&gt;{Driver}-&gt;visit_child_handles(sub {
             my ($h, $info) = @_;
             ++$connections if $h-&gt;{Name} =~ /foo/;
             return 0; # don't visit kids
         })

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b> <b>COMMON</b> <b>TO</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>HANDLES</b></h4><pre>
       These attributes are common to all types of DBI handles.

       Some  attributes  are inherited by child handles. That is, the value of an inherited attribute in a newly
       created statement handle is the same as the value in the parent database handle. Changes to attributes in
       the new statement handle do not affect the parent database handle and changes to the database  handle  do
       not affect existing statement handles, only future ones.

       Attempting to set or get the value of an unknown attribute generates a warning, except for private driver
       specific attributes (which all have names starting with a lowercase letter).

       Example:

         $h-&gt;{AttributeName} = ...;    # set/write
         ... = $h-&gt;{AttributeName};    # get/read

       <u>"Warn"</u>

       Type: boolean, inherited

       The  "Warn"  attribute  enables  useful  warnings for certain bad practices. It is enabled by default and
       should only be disabled in rare circumstances.  Since  warnings  are  generated  using  the  Perl  "warn"
       function, they can be intercepted using the Perl $SIG{__WARN__} hook.

       The "Warn" attribute is not related to the "PrintWarn" attribute.

       <u>"Active"</u>

       Type: boolean, read-only

       The "Active" attribute is true if the handle object is "active". This is rarely used in applications. The
       exact  meaning  of  active is somewhat vague at the moment. For a database handle it typically means that
       the handle is connected to a database ("$dbh-&gt;disconnect" sets "Active" off).  For a statement handle  it
       typically means that the handle is a "SELECT" that may have more data to fetch. (Fetching all the data or
       calling "$sth-&gt;finish" sets "Active" off.)

       <u>"Executed"</u>

       Type: boolean

       The  "Executed" attribute is true if the handle object has been "executed".  Currently only the $dbh <b>do()</b>
       method and the $sth <b>execute()</b>,  <b>execute_array()</b>,  and  <b>execute_for_fetch()</b>  methods  set  the  "Executed"
       attribute.

       When it's set on a handle it is also set on the parent handle at the same time. So calling <b>execute()</b> on a
       $sth also sets the "Executed" attribute on the parent $dbh.

       The "Executed" attribute for a database handle is cleared by the <b>commit()</b> and <b>rollback()</b> methods (even if
       they  fail).  The  "Executed"  attribute  of  a  statement  handle  is  not  cleared by the DBI under any
       circumstances and so acts as a permanent record of whether the statement handle was ever used.

       The "Executed" attribute was added in DBI 1.41.

       <u>"Kids"</u>

       Type: integer, read-only

       For a driver handle, "Kids" is the number of currently existing database handles that were  created  from
       that  driver handle.  For a database handle, "Kids" is the number of currently existing statement handles
       that were created from that database handle.  For a statement handle, the value is zero.

       <u>"ActiveKids"</u>

       Type: integer, read-only

       Like "Kids", but only counting those that are "Active" (as above).

       <u>"CachedKids"</u>

       Type: hash ref

       For a database handle, "CachedKids" returns a reference to the cache (hash) of statement handles  created
       by the "prepare_cached" method.  For a driver handle, returns a reference to the cache (hash) of database
       handles created by the "connect_cached" method.

       <u>"Type"</u>

       Type: scalar, read-only

       The  "Type"  attribute  identifies  the  type of a DBI handle.  Returns "dr" for driver handles, "db" for
       database handles and "st" for statement handles.

       <u>"ChildHandles"</u>

       Type: array ref

       The ChildHandles attribute contains a reference to an array of all the handles  created  by  this  handle
       which  are  still  accessible.   The  contents  of the array are weak-refs and will become undef when the
       handle goes out of scope. (They're cleared out occasionally.)

       "ChildHandles" returns  undef  if  your  perl  version  does  not  support  weak  references  (check  the
       Scalar::Util module).  The referenced array returned should be treated as read-only.

       For example, to enumerate all driver handles, database handles and statement handles:

           sub show_child_handles {
               my ($h, $level) = @_;
               printf "%sh %s %s\n", $h-&gt;{Type}, "\t" x $level, $h;
               show_child_handles($_, $level + 1)
                   for (grep { defined } @{$h-&gt;{ChildHandles}});
           }

           my %drivers = DBI-&gt;installed_drivers();
           show_child_handles($_, 0) for (values %drivers);

       <u>"CompatMode"</u>

       Type: boolean, inherited

       The  "CompatMode"  attribute is used by emulation layers (such as Oraperl) to enable compatible behaviour
       in the underlying driver (e.g., DBD::Oracle) for this handle. Not normally set by application code.

       It also has the effect of disabling the 'quick FETCH' of attribute  values  from  the  handles  attribute
       cache.  So  all  attribute  values  are handled by the drivers own FETCH method. This makes them slightly
       slower but is useful for special-purpose drivers like DBD::Multiplex.

       <u>"InactiveDestroy"</u>

       Type: boolean

       The default value, false, means a handle will be fully destroyed as normal when the last reference to  it
       is removed, just as you'd expect.

       If  set  true  then  the  handle will be treated by the DESTROY as if it was no longer Active, and so the
       <u>database</u> <u>engine</u> related effects of DESTROYing a handle will be skipped.  Think of  the  name  as  meaning
       'treat the handle as not-Active in the DESTROY method'.

       For  a  database  handle, this attribute does not disable an <u>explicit</u> call to the disconnect method, only
       the implicit call from DESTROY that happens if the handle is still marked as "Active".

       This attribute is specifically designed for use in Unix applications that "fork"  child  processes.   For
       some  drivers,  when the child process exits the destruction of inherited handles cause the corresponding
       handles in the parent process to cease working.

       Either the parent or the child process, but not both, should set  "InactiveDestroy"  true  on  all  their
       shared  handles.  Alternatively,  and  preferably,  the "AutoInactiveDestroy" can be set in the parent on
       connect.

       To help tracing applications using fork the process id is shown in the trace log whenever a DBI or handle
       <b>trace()</b> method is called.  The process id also shown for <u>every</u> method call if the DBI  trace  level  (not
       handle trace level) is set high enough to show the trace from the DBI's method dispatcher, e.g. &gt;= 9.

       <u>"AutoInactiveDestroy"</u>

       Type: boolean, inherited

       The "InactiveDestroy" attribute, described above, needs to be explicitly set in the child process after a
       <b>fork()</b>,  on  every active database and statement handle.  This is a problem if the code that performs the
       <b>fork()</b> is not under your control, perhaps in a third-party  module.   Use  "AutoInactiveDestroy"  to  get
       around this situation.

       If  set  true,  the  DESTROY  method  will  check the process id of the handle and, if different from the
       current process id, it  will  set  the  <u>InactiveDestroy</u>  attribute.   It  is  strongly  recommended  that
       "AutoInactiveDestroy"  is  enabled  on  all new code (it's only not enabled by default to avoid backwards
       compatibility problems).

       This is the example it's designed to deal with:

           my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(...);
           some_code_that_forks(); # Perhaps without your knowledge
           # Child process dies, destroying the inherited dbh
           $dbh-&gt;do(...); # Breaks because parent $dbh is now broken

       The "AutoInactiveDestroy" attribute was added in DBI 1.614.

       <u>"PrintWarn"</u>

       Type: boolean, inherited

       The "PrintWarn" attribute controls the printing of warnings recorded by the driver.  When set to  a  true
       value  (the  default)  the DBI will check method calls to see if a warning condition has been set. If so,
       the DBI will effectively do a "warn("$class $method warning: $DBI::errstr")" where $class is  the  driver
       class and $method is the name of the method which failed. E.g.,

         DBD::Oracle::db execute warning: ... warning text here ...

       If  desired,  the  warnings  can  be  caught and processed using a $SIG{__WARN__} handler or modules like
       CGI::Carp and CGI::ErrorWrap.

       See also "set_err" for how warnings are recorded and "HandleSetErr" for how to influence it.

       Fetching the full details of warnings can require an extra round-trip to the  database  server  for  some
       drivers.  In  which case the driver may opt to only fetch the full details of warnings if the "PrintWarn"
       attribute is true. If "PrintWarn" is false then these drivers should still indicate the fact  that  there
       were warnings by setting the warning string to, for example: "3 warnings".

       <u>"PrintError"</u>

       Type: boolean, inherited

       The "PrintError" attribute can be used to force errors to generate warnings (using "warn") in addition to
       returning  error  codes in the normal way.  When set "on", any method which results in an error occurring
       will cause the DBI to effectively do a "warn("$class $method failed: $DBI::errstr")" where $class is  the
       driver class and $method is the name of the method which failed. E.g.,

         DBD::Oracle::db prepare failed: ... error text here ...

       By default, "DBI-&gt;connect" sets "PrintError" "on".

       If  desired,  the  warnings  can  be  caught and processed using a $SIG{__WARN__} handler or modules like
       CGI::Carp and CGI::ErrorWrap.

       <u>"RaiseWarn"</u>

       Type: boolean, inherited

       The "RaiseWarn" attribute can be used to force warnings to raise exceptions rather then  simply  printing
       them.  It is "off" by default.  When set "on", any method which sets warning condition will cause the DBI
       to effectively do a "die("$class $method warning: $DBI::errstr")", where $class is the driver  class  and
       $method is the name of the method that sets warning condition. E.g.,

         DBD::Oracle::db execute warning: ... warning text here ...

       If you turn "RaiseWarn" on then you'd normally turn "PrintWarn" off.  If "PrintWarn" is also on, then the
       "PrintWarn" is done first (naturally).

       This attribute was added in DBI 1.643.

       <u>"RaiseError"</u>

       Type: boolean, inherited

       The  "RaiseError"  attribute  can  be  used to force errors to raise exceptions rather than simply return
       error codes in the normal way. It is "off" by default.  When set "on", any method  which  results  in  an
       error  will  cause the DBI to effectively do a "die("$class $method failed: $DBI::errstr")", where $class
       is the driver class and $method is the name of the method that failed. E.g.,

         DBD::Oracle::db prepare failed: ... error text here ...

       If you turn "RaiseError" on then you'd normally turn "PrintError" off.  If "PrintError" is also on,  then
       the "PrintError" is done first (naturally).

       Typically  "RaiseError"  is  used  in conjunction with "eval", or a module like Try::Tiny or TryCatch, to
       catch the exception that's been thrown and handle it.  For example:

         use Try::Tiny;

         try {
           ...
           $sth-&gt;execute();
           ...
         } catch {
           # $sth-&gt;err and $DBI::err will be true if error was from DBI
           warn $_; # print the error (which Try::Tiny puts into $_)
           ... # do whatever you need to deal with the error
         };

       In the catch block the $DBI::lasth variable can be useful for diagnosis and reporting  if  you  can't  be
       sure which handle triggered the error.  For example, $DBI::lasth-&gt;{Type} and $DBI::lasth-&gt;{Statement}.

       See also "Transactions".

       If  you  want to temporarily turn "RaiseError" off (inside a library function that is likely to fail, for
       example), the recommended way is like this:

         {
           local $h-&gt;{RaiseError};  # localize and turn off for this block
           ...
         }

       The original value will automatically and reliably be restored by Perl, regardless of how  the  block  is
       exited.  The same logic applies to other attributes, including "PrintError".

       <u>"HandleError"</u>

       Type: code ref, inherited

       The  "HandleError"  attribute can be used to provide your own alternative behaviour in case of errors. If
       set to a reference to a subroutine then that subroutine is called when an error is detected (at the  same
       point  that "RaiseError" and "PrintError" are handled). It is called also when "RaiseWarn" is enabled and
       a warning is detected.

       The subroutine is called with three parameters: the error message string that  "RaiseError",  "RaiseWarn"
       or  "PrintError"  would  use, the DBI handle being used, and the first value being returned by the method
       that failed (typically undef).

       If the subroutine returns a false value then the "RaiseError", "RaiseWarn" and/or "PrintError" attributes
       are checked and acted upon as normal.

       For example, to "die" with a full stack trace for any error:

         use Carp;
         $h-&gt;{HandleError} = sub { confess(shift) };

       Or to turn errors into exceptions:

         use Exception; # or your own favourite exception module
         $h-&gt;{HandleError} = sub { Exception-&gt;new('DBI')-&gt;raise($_[0]) };

       It is possible to 'stack' multiple HandleError handlers by using closures:

         sub your_subroutine {
           my $previous_handler = $h-&gt;{HandleError};
           $h-&gt;{HandleError} = sub {
             return 1 if $previous_handler and &amp;$previous_handler(@_);
             ... your code here ...
           };
         }

       Using a "my" inside a subroutine to store the previous "HandleError" value is important.  See perlsub and
       perlref for more information about <u>closures</u>.

       It is possible for "HandleError"  to  alter  the  error  message  that  will  be  used  by  "RaiseError",
       "RaiseWarn"  and  "PrintError"  if it returns false.  It can do that by altering the value of $_[0]. This
       example appends a stack trace to all errors and, unlike the previous example  using  Carp::confess,  this
       will work "PrintError" as well as "RaiseError":

         $h-&gt;{HandleError} = sub { $_[0]=Carp::longmess($_[0]); 0; };

       It  is also possible for "HandleError" to hide an error, to a limited degree, by using "set_err" to reset
       $DBI::err and $DBI::errstr, and altering the return value of the failed method. For example:

         $h-&gt;{HandleError} = sub {
           return 0 unless $_[0] =~ /^\S+ fetchrow_arrayref failed:/;
           return 0 unless $_[1]-&gt;err == 1234; # the error to 'hide'
           $h-&gt;set_err(undef,undef);   # turn off the error
           $_[2] = [ ... ];    # supply alternative return value
           return 1;
         };

       This only works for methods which return a single value and is hard to make reliable  (avoiding  infinite
       loops,  for example) and so isn't recommended for general use!  If you find a <u>good</u> use for it then please
       let me know.

       <u>"HandleSetErr"</u>

       Type: code ref, inherited

       The "HandleSetErr" attribute can be used to intercept the setting of handle "err", "errstr", and  "state"
       values.   If  set  to  a  reference  to a subroutine then that subroutine is called whenever <b>set_err()</b> is
       called, typically by the driver or a subclass.

       The subroutine is called with five arguments, the first five that were passed to <b>set_err()</b>:  the  handle,
       the  "err", "errstr", and "state" values being set, and the method name. These can be altered by changing
       the values in the @_ array. The return value affects <b>set_err()</b> behaviour, see "set_err" for details.

       It is possible to 'stack' multiple HandleSetErr handlers by using  closures.  See  "HandleError"  for  an
       example.

       The  "HandleSetErr"  and  "HandleError" subroutines differ in subtle but significant ways. HandleError is
       only invoked at the point where the DBI is about to return to the application with "err" set true.   It's
       not  invoked  by  the failure of a method that's been called by another DBI method.  HandleSetErr, on the
       other hand, is called whenever <b>set_err()</b> is called with a defined "err" value, even if  false.   So  it's
       not  just  for  errors,  despite the name, but also warn and info states.  The <b>set_err()</b> method, and thus
       HandleSetErr, may be called multiple times within a method and is usually invoked from deep within driver
       code.

       In theory a driver can use the return value from HandleSetErr via <b>set_err()</b> to decide whether to continue
       or not. If <b>set_err()</b> returns an empty list, indicating that  the  HandleSetErr  code  has  'handled'  the
       'error',  the  driver  could then continue instead of failing (if that's a reasonable thing to do).  This
       isn't excepted to be common and any such cases should be clearly marked in the driver  documentation  and
       discussed on the dbi-dev mailing list.

       The "HandleSetErr" attribute was added in DBI 1.41.

       <u>"ErrCount"</u>

       Type: unsigned integer

       The  "ErrCount"  attribute  is  incremented  whenever  the  <b>set_err()</b>  method  records an error. It isn't
       incremented by warnings or information states. It is not reset by the DBI at any time.

       The "ErrCount" attribute was added in DBI 1.41. Older drivers may not have been updated to use  <b>set_err()</b>
       to record errors and so this attribute may not be incremented when using them.

       <u>"ShowErrorStatement"</u>

       Type: boolean, inherited

       The "ShowErrorStatement" attribute can be used to cause the relevant Statement text to be appended to the
       error messages generated by the "RaiseError", "PrintError", "RaiseWarn" and "PrintWarn" attributes.  Only
       applies  to  errors  on  statement handles plus the <b>prepare()</b>, <b>do()</b>, and the various "select*()" database
       handle methods.  (The exact format of the appended text is subject to change.)

       If "$h-&gt;{ParamValues}" returns a  hash  reference  of  parameter  (placeholder)  values  then  those  are
       formatted and appended to the end of the Statement text in the error message.

       <u>"TraceLevel"</u>

       Type: integer, inherited

       The "TraceLevel" attribute can be used as an alternative to the "trace" method to set the DBI trace level
       and trace flags for a specific handle.  See "TRACING" for more details.

       The  "TraceLevel"  attribute  is  especially useful combined with "local" to alter the trace settings for
       just a single block of code.

       <u>"FetchHashKeyName"</u>

       Type: string, inherited

       The "FetchHashKeyName" attribute is used to specify whether the <b>fetchrow_hashref()</b> method should  perform
       case conversion on the field names used for the hash keys. For historical reasons it defaults to '"NAME"'
       but  it  is recommended to set it to '"NAME_lc"' (convert to lower case) or '"NAME_uc"' (convert to upper
       case) according to your preference.  It can only be set for driver and database handles.   For  statement
       handles the value is frozen when <b>prepare()</b> is called.

       <u>"ChopBlanks"</u>

       Type: boolean, inherited

       The  "ChopBlanks"  attribute  can be used to control the trimming of trailing space characters from fixed
       width character (CHAR) fields. No other field types are affected, even where field values  have  trailing
       spaces.

       The  default  is  false  (although  it  is possible that the default may change).  Applications that need
       specific behaviour should set the attribute as needed.

       Drivers are not required to support this attribute, but any driver which does not support it must arrange
       to return "undef" as the attribute value.

       <u>"LongReadLen"</u>

       Type: unsigned integer, inherited

       The "LongReadLen" attribute may be used to control the maximum length of 'long' type fields (LONG,  BLOB,
       CLOB,  MEMO, etc.) which the driver will read from the database automatically when it fetches each row of
       data.

       The "LongReadLen" attribute only relates to fetching and reading long  values;  it  is  not  involved  in
       inserting or updating them.

       A value of 0 means not to automatically fetch any long data.  Drivers may return undef or an empty string
       for long fields when "LongReadLen" is 0.

       The  default  is typically 0 (zero) or 80 bytes but may vary between drivers.  Applications fetching long
       fields should set this value to slightly larger than the longest long field value to be fetched.

       Some databases return some long types encoded as pairs of hex digits.   For  these  types,  "LongReadLen"
       relates to the underlying data length and not the doubled-up length of the encoded string.

       Changing  the  value of "LongReadLen" for a statement handle after it has been "prepare"'d will typically
       have no effect, so it's common to set "LongReadLen" on the $dbh before calling "prepare".

       For most drivers the value used here has a direct effect on the memory used by the statement handle while
       it's active, so don't be too generous. If you can't be sure what value to use you could execute an  extra
       select statement to determine the longest value.  For example:

         $dbh-&gt;{LongReadLen} = $dbh-&gt;selectrow_array(qq{
             SELECT MAX(OCTET_LENGTH(long_column_name))
             FROM table WHERE ...
         });
         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(qq{
             SELECT long_column_name, ... FROM table WHERE ...
         });

       You  may  need  to  take  extra care if the table can be modified between the first select and the second
       being executed. You may also need to use a different function if <b>OCTET_LENGTH()</b> does not  work  for  long
       types in your database. For example, for Sybase use <b>DATALENGTH()</b> and for Oracle use <b>LENGTHB()</b>.

       See also "LongTruncOk" for information on truncation of long types.

       <u>"LongTruncOk"</u>

       Type: boolean, inherited

       The  "LongTruncOk"  attribute  may be used to control the effect of fetching a long field value which has
       been truncated (typically because it's longer than the value of the "LongReadLen" attribute).

       By default, "LongTruncOk" is false and so fetching a long value that needs to be truncated will cause the
       fetch to fail.  (Applications should always be sure to check for errors after a fetch  loop  in  case  an
       error, such as a divide by zero or long field truncation, caused the fetch to terminate prematurely.)

       If  a fetch fails due to a long field truncation when "LongTruncOk" is false, many drivers will allow you
       to continue fetching further rows.

       See also "LongReadLen".

       <u>"TaintIn"</u>

       Type: boolean, inherited

       If the "TaintIn" attribute is set to a true value <u>and</u> Perl is running in taint mode (e.g.,  started  with
       the "-T" option), then all the arguments to most DBI method calls are checked for being tainted. <u>This</u> <u>may</u>
       <u>change.</u>

       The attribute defaults to off, even if Perl is in taint mode.  See perlsec for more about taint mode.  If
       Perl is not running in taint mode, this attribute has no effect.

       When  fetching data that you trust you can turn off the TaintIn attribute, for that statement handle, for
       the duration of the fetch loop.

       The "TaintIn" attribute was added in DBI 1.31.

       <u>"TaintOut"</u>

       Type: boolean, inherited

       If the "TaintOut" attribute is set to a true value <u>and</u> Perl is running in taint mode (e.g., started  with
       the "-T" option), then most data fetched from the database is considered tainted. <u>This</u> <u>may</u> <u>change.</u>

       The attribute defaults to off, even if Perl is in taint mode.  See perlsec for more about taint mode.  If
       Perl is not running in taint mode, this attribute has no effect.

       When fetching data that you trust you can turn off the TaintOut attribute, for that statement handle, for
       the duration of the fetch loop.

       Currently  only  fetched  data is tainted. It is possible that the results of other DBI method calls, and
       the value of fetched attributes, may also be tainted in future versions. That change may well break  your
       applications unless you take great care now. If you use DBI Taint mode, please report your experience and
       any suggestions for changes.

       The "TaintOut" attribute was added in DBI 1.31.

       <u>"Taint"</u>

       Type: boolean, inherited

       The  "Taint"  attribute  is  a  shortcut  for  "TaintIn" and "TaintOut" (it is also present for backwards
       compatibility).

       Setting this attribute sets both "TaintIn" and "TaintOut", and retrieving it returns a true value if  and
       only if "TaintIn" and "TaintOut" are both set to true values.

       <u>"Profile"</u>

       Type: inherited

       The  "Profile"  attribute enables the collection and reporting of method call timing statistics.  See the
       DBI::Profile module documentation for <u>much</u> more detail.

       The "Profile" attribute was added in DBI 1.24.

       <u>"ReadOnly"</u>

       Type: boolean, inherited

       An application can set the "ReadOnly" attribute of a handle to a true value to indicate that it will  not
       be attempting to make any changes using that handle or any children of it.

       Note  that  the  exact definition of 'read only' is rather fuzzy.  For more details see the documentation
       for the driver you're using.

       If the driver can make the handle truly read-only then it should (unless doing so would  have  unpleasant
       side  effect,  like  changing  the  consistency  level from per-statement to per-session).  Otherwise the
       attribute is simply advisory.

       A driver can set the "ReadOnly" attribute itself to indicate that the data it is connected to  cannot  be
       changed for some reason.

       If  the  driver  cannot  ensure the "ReadOnly" attribute is adhered to it will record a warning.  In this
       case reading the "ReadOnly" attribute back after it is set true will return true even if  the  underlying
       driver cannot ensure this (so any application knows the application declared itself ReadOnly).

       Library  modules  and  proxy drivers can use the attribute to influence their behavior.  For example, the
       DBD::Gofer driver considers the "ReadOnly" attribute when making a decision about  whether  to  retry  an
       operation that failed.

       The attribute should be set to 1 or 0 (or undef). Other values are reserved.

       <u>"Callbacks"</u>

       Type: hash ref

       The  DBI  callback mechanism lets you intercept, and optionally replace, any method call on a DBI handle.
       At the extreme, it lets you become a puppet master, deceiving the application in any way you want.

       The "Callbacks" attribute is a hash reference where the keys are DBI method names and the values are code
       references. For each key naming a method, the DBI will  execute  the  associated  code  reference  before
       executing the method.

       The arguments to the code reference will be the same as to the method, including the invocant (a database
       handle or statement handle). For example, say that to callback to some code on a call to prepare():

         $dbh-&gt;{Callbacks} = {
             prepare =&gt; sub {
                 my ($dbh, $query, $attrs) = @_;
                 print "Preparing q{$query}\n"
             },
         };

       The callback would then be executed when you called the prepare() method:

         $dbh-&gt;prepare('SELECT 1');

       And the output of course would be:

         Preparing q{SELECT 1}

       Because  callbacks  are executed <u>before</u> the methods they're associated with, you can modify the arguments
       before they're passed on to the method call. For example, to make sure that all calls  to  prepare()  are
       immediately  prepared  by  DBD::Pg, add a callback that makes sure that the "pg_prepare_now" attribute is
       always set:

         my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect($dsn, $username, $auth, {
             Callbacks =&gt; {
                 prepare =&gt; sub {
                     $_[2] ||= {};
                     $_[2]-&gt;{pg_prepare_now} = 1;
                     return; # must return nothing
                 },
             }
         });

       Note that we are editing the contents of @_ directly. In this case we've created the attributes  hash  if
       it's not passed to the "prepare" call.

       You  can  also prevent the associated method from ever executing. While a callback executes, $_ holds the
       method name. (This allows multiple callbacks to share the same code reference and still know what  method
       was  called.)   To  prevent  the  method from executing, simply "undef $_". For example, if you wanted to
       disable calls to ping(), you could do this:

         $dbh-&gt;{Callbacks} = {
             ping =&gt; sub {
                 # tell dispatch to not call the method:
                 undef $_;
                 # return this value instead:
                 return "42 bells";
             }
         };

       As with other attributes, Callbacks can be specified on a handle or  via  the  attributes  to  connect().
       Callbacks can also be applied to a statement methods on a statement handle. For example:

         $sth-&gt;{Callbacks} = {
             execute =&gt; sub {
                 print "Executing ", shift-&gt;{Statement}, "\n";
             }
         };

       The  "Callbacks"  attribute  of  a  database  handle isn't copied to any statement handles it creates. So
       setting callbacks for a statement handle requires you to set the "Callbacks" attribute on  the  statement
       handle yourself, as in the example above, or use the special "ChildCallbacks" key described below.

       <b>Special</b> <b>Keys</b> <b>in</b> <b>Callbacks</b> <b>Attribute</b>

       In addition to DBI handle method names, the "Callbacks" hash reference supports four additional keys.

       The  first  is  the  "ChildCallbacks"  key. When a statement handle is created from a database handle the
       "ChildCallbacks" key of the database handle's "Callbacks" attribute, if any, becomes the new  "Callbacks"
       attribute of the statement handle.  This allows you to define callbacks for all statement handles created
       from  a  database handle. For example, if you wanted to count how many times "execute" was called in your
       application, you could write:

         my $exec_count = 0;
         my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect( $dsn, $username, $auth, {
             Callbacks =&gt; {
                 ChildCallbacks =&gt; {
                     execute =&gt; sub { $exec_count++; return; }
                 }
             }
         });

         END {
             print "The execute method was called $exec_count times\n";
         }

       The   other   three   special   keys   are    "connect_cached.new",    "connect_cached.connected",    and
       "connect_cached.reused". These keys define callbacks that are called when connect_cached() is called, but
       allow  different  behaviors  depending  on  whether  a new handle is created or a handle is returned. The
       callback is invoked with these arguments: "$dbh, $dsn, $user, $auth, $attr".

       For example, some applications uses connect_cached()  to  connect  with  "AutoCommit"  enabled  and  then
       disable  "AutoCommit"  temporarily  for transactions. If connect_cached() is called during a transaction,
       perhaps in a utility method, then it might select the same cached handle and then force "AutoCommit"  on,
       forcing  a  commit  of  the  transaction. See the "connect_cached" documentation for one way to deal with
       that. Here we'll describe an alternative approach using a callback.

       Because   the   "connect_cached.new"   and   "connect_cached.reused"   callbacks   are   invoked   before
       connect_cached() has applied the connect attributes, you can use them to edit the attributes that will be
       applied.  To prevent a cached handle from having its transactions committed before it's returned, you can
       eliminate the "AutoCommit" attribute in a "connect_cached.reused" callback, like so:

         my $cb = {
             'connect_cached.reused' =&gt; sub { delete $_[4]-&gt;{AutoCommit} },
         };

         sub dbh {
             my $self = shift;
             DBI-&gt;connect_cached( $dsn, $username, $auth, {
                 PrintError =&gt; 0,
                 RaiseError =&gt; 1,
                 AutoCommit =&gt; 1,
                 Callbacks  =&gt; $cb,
             });
         }

       The upshot is that new database handles are created with  "AutoCommit"  enabled,  while  cached  database
       handles are left in whatever transaction state they happened to be in when retrieved from the cache.

       Note  that  we've  also used a lexical for the callbacks hash reference. This is because connect_cached()
       returns a new database handle if any of the attributes passed to is have changed. If we  used  an  inline
       hash reference, connect_cached() would return a new database handle every time. Which would rather defeat
       the purpose.

       A  more  common  application for callbacks is setting connection state only when a new connection is made
       (by <b>connect()</b> or <b>connect_cached()</b>). Adding a callback to the connected method (when using  "connect")  or
       via  "connect_cached.connected"  (when useing <b>connect_cached()</b>&gt;) makes this easy.  The <b>connected()</b> method
       is a no-op by default (unless you subclass the DBI and change it). The DBI calls it to  indicate  that  a
       new  connection  has  been made and the connection attributes have all been set. You can give it a bit of
       added functionality by applying a callback to it. For example, to make sure that MySQL  understands  your
       application's ANSI-compliant SQL, set it up like so:

         my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect($dsn, $username, $auth, {
             Callbacks =&gt; {
                 connected =&gt; sub {
                     shift-&gt;do(q{
                         SET SESSION sql_mode='ansi,strict_trans_tables,no_auto_value_on_zero';
                     });
                     return;
                 },
             }
         });

       If  you're  using connect_cached(), use the "connect_cached.connected" callback, instead. This is because
       connected() is called for both new and reused database handles, but you want to execute a  callback  only
       the  when  a  new  database  handle  is  returned.  For  example, to set the time zone on connection to a
       PostgreSQL database, try this:

         my $cb = {
             'connect_cached.connected' =&gt; sub {
                 shift-&gt;do('SET timezone = UTC');
             }
         };

         sub dbh {
             my $self = shift;
             DBI-&gt;connect_cached( $dsn, $username, $auth, { Callbacks =&gt; $cb });
         }

       One significant limitation with callbacks is that there can only be one per method per handle. This means
       it's easy for one use of callbacks to interfere with, or  typically  simply  overwrite,  another  use  of
       callbacks.  For  this  reason  modules  using  callbacks  should document the fact clearly so application
       authors can tell if use of callbacks by the module will clash with use of callbacks by the application.

       You might be able to work around this issue by taking a copy of the  original  callback  and  calling  it
       within your own. For example:

         my $prev_cb = $h-&gt;{Callbacks}{method_name};
         $h-&gt;{Callbacks}{method_name} = sub {
           if ($prev_cb) {
               my @result = $prev_cb-&gt;(@_);
               return @result if not $_; # $prev_cb vetoed call
           }
           ... your callback logic here ...
         };

       <u>"private_your_module_name_*"</u>

       The  DBI  provides a way to store extra information in a DBI handle as "private" attributes. The DBI will
       allow you to store and retrieve any attribute which has a name starting with ""private_"".

       It is <u>strongly</u> recommended that you use just <u>one</u> private attribute (e.g., use a hash ref) <u>and</u> give  it  a
       long  and  unambiguous  name  that  includes the module or application name that the attribute relates to
       (e.g., ""private_YourFullModuleName_thingy"").

       Because of the way the Perl tie mechanism works you cannot reliably use the "||="  operator  directly  to
       initialise the attribute, like this:

         my $foo = $dbh-&gt;{private_yourmodname_foo} ||= { ... }; # WRONG

       you should use a two step approach like this:

         my $foo = $dbh-&gt;{private_yourmodname_foo};
         $foo ||= $dbh-&gt;{private_yourmodname_foo} = { ... };

       This  attribute  is  primarily  of interest to people sub-classing DBI, or for applications to piggy-back
       extra information onto DBI handles.

</pre><h4><b>DBI</b> <b>DATABASE</b> <b>HANDLE</b> <b>OBJECTS</b></h4><pre>
       This section covers the methods and attributes associated with database handles.

   <b>Database</b> <b>Handle</b> <b>Methods</b>
       The following methods are specified for DBI database handles:

       <u>"clone"</u>

         $new_dbh = $dbh-&gt;clone(\%attr);

       The "clone" method duplicates the $dbh connection by connecting with the same  parameters  ($dsn,  $user,
       $password) as originally used.

       The attributes for the cloned connect are the same as those used for the <u>original</u> connect, with any other
       attributes in "\%attr" merged over them.  Effectively the same as doing:

         %attributes_used = ( %original_attributes, %attr );

       If \%attr is not given then it defaults to a hash containing all the attributes in the attribute cache of
       $dbh  excluding  any  non-code  references,  plus  the  main  boolean attributes (RaiseError, PrintError,
       AutoCommit, etc.). <u>This</u> <u>behaviour</u> <u>is</u> <u>unreliable</u> <u>and</u> <u>so</u> <u>use</u> <u>of</u> <u>clone</u> <u>without</u> <u>an</u> <u>argument</u> <u>is</u> <u>deprecated</u> <u>and</u>
       <u>may</u> <u>cause</u> <u>a</u> <u>warning</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>future</u> <u>release.</u>

       The clone method can be used even if the database handle is disconnected.

       The "clone" method was added in DBI 1.33.

       <u>"data_sources"</u>

         @ary = $dbh-&gt;data_sources();
         @ary = $dbh-&gt;data_sources(\%attr);

       Returns a list of data sources (databases) available via the $dbh driver's  <b>data_sources()</b>  method,  plus
       any  extra  data  sources  that  the driver can discover via the connected $dbh. Typically the extra data
       sources are other databases managed by the same server process that the $dbh is connected to.

       Data sources are returned in a form suitable for passing to the "connect"  method  (that  is,  they  will
       include the ""dbi:$driver:"" prefix).

       The <b>data_sources()</b> method, for a $dbh, was added in DBI 1.38.

       <u>"do"</u>

         $rows = $dbh-&gt;do($statement)           or die $dbh-&gt;errstr;
         $rows = $dbh-&gt;do($statement, \%attr)   or die $dbh-&gt;errstr;
         $rows = $dbh-&gt;do($statement, \%attr, @bind_values) or die ...

       Prepare and execute a single statement. Returns the number of rows affected or "undef" on error. A return
       value of -1 means the number of rows is not known, not applicable, or not available.

       This  method  is  typically  most  useful  for  <u>non</u>-"SELECT" statements that either cannot be prepared in
       advance (due to a limitation of the driver) or do not need to be executed repeatedly. It  should  not  be
       used for "SELECT" statements because it does not return a statement handle (so you can't fetch any data).

       The default "do" method is logically similar to:

         sub do {
             my($dbh, $statement, $attr, @bind_values) = @_;
             my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($statement, $attr) or return undef;
             $sth-&gt;execute(@bind_values) or return undef;
             my $rows = $sth-&gt;rows;
             ($rows == 0) ? "0E0" : $rows; # always return true if no error
         }

       For example:

         my $rows_deleted = $dbh-&gt;do(q{
             DELETE FROM table
             WHERE status = ?
         }, undef, 'DONE') or die $dbh-&gt;errstr;

       Using  placeholders  and  @bind_values  with  the "do" method can be useful because it avoids the need to
       correctly quote any variables in the $statement. But if you'll be executing the statement many times then
       it's more efficient to "prepare" it once and call "execute" many times instead.

       The "q{...}" style quoting used in this example avoids clashing with quotes that may be used in  the  SQL
       statement.  Use  the  double-quote-like  "qq{...}" operator if you want to interpolate variables into the
       string.  See "Quote and Quote-like Operators" in perlop for more details.

       Note drivers are free to avoid the overhead of creating an DBI statement handle for <b>do()</b>,  especially  if
       there are no parameters. In this case error handlers, if invoked during <b>do()</b>, will be passed the database
       handle.

       <u>"last_insert_id"</u>

         $rv = $dbh-&gt;last_insert_id();
         $rv = $dbh-&gt;last_insert_id($catalog, $schema, $table, $field);
         $rv = $dbh-&gt;last_insert_id($catalog, $schema, $table, $field, \%attr);

       Returns  a  value  'identifying'  the  row  just  inserted, if possible.  Typically this would be a value
       assigned by the database server to a column with an <u>auto_increment</u> or <u>serial</u> type.  Returns undef if  the
       driver does not support the method or can't determine the value.

       The  $catalog,  $schema,  $table, and $field parameters may be required for some drivers (see below).  If
       you don't know the parameter values and your driver does not need them, then use "undef" for each.

       There are several caveats to be  aware  of  with  this  method  if  you  want  to  use  it  for  portable
       applications:

       <b>*</b>  For  some  drivers the value may only be available immediately after the insert statement has executed
       (e.g., mysql, Informix).

       <b>*</b> For some drivers the $catalog, $schema, $table, and $field parameters are required, for others they are
       ignored (e.g., mysql).

       <b>*</b> Drivers may return an indeterminate value if no insert has been performed yet.

       <b>*</b> For some drivers the value may only be available if placeholders have <u>not</u> been used (e.g.,  Sybase,  MS
       SQL). In this case the value returned would be from the last non-placeholder insert statement.

       <b>*</b>  Some  drivers  may  need driver-specific hints about how to get the value. For example, being told the
       name of the database 'sequence' object that holds the value. Any such hints are passed as driver-specific
       attributes in the \%attr parameter.

       <b>*</b> If the underlying database offers nothing better, then some  drivers  may  attempt  to  implement  this
       method by executing ""select max($field) from $table"". Drivers using any approach like this should issue
       a  warning if "AutoCommit" is true because it is generally unsafe - another process may have modified the
       table between your insert and the select. For situations where you know it is safe, such as when you have
       locked the table, you can silence the warning by passing "Warn" =&gt; 0 in \%attr.

       <b>*</b> If no insert has been performed yet, or the last  insert  failed,  then  the  value  is  implementation
       defined.

       Given all the caveats above, it's clear that this method must be used with care.

       The "last_insert_id" method was added in DBI 1.38.

       <u>"selectrow_array"</u>

         @row_ary = $dbh-&gt;selectrow_array($statement);
         @row_ary = $dbh-&gt;selectrow_array($statement, \%attr);
         @row_ary = $dbh-&gt;selectrow_array($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

       This utility method combines "prepare", "execute" and "fetchrow_array" into a single call. If called in a
       list  context,  it  returns  the first row of data from the statement.  The $statement parameter can be a
       previously prepared statement handle, in which case the "prepare" is skipped.

       If any method fails, and "RaiseError" is not set, "selectrow_array" will return an empty list.

       If called in a scalar context for a statement handle that has more  than  one  column,  it  is  undefined
       whether  the  driver will return the value of the first column or the last. So don't do that.  Also, in a
       scalar context, an "undef" is returned if there are no more rows or if an error  occurred.  That  "undef"
       can't  be  distinguished  from  an  "undef"  returned  because the first field value was NULL.  For these
       reasons you should exercise some caution if you use "selectrow_array" in a scalar context, or just  don't
       do that.

       <u>"selectrow_arrayref"</u>

         $ary_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectrow_arrayref($statement);
         $ary_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectrow_arrayref($statement, \%attr);
         $ary_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectrow_arrayref($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

       This  utility method combines "prepare", "execute" and "fetchrow_arrayref" into a single call. It returns
       the first row of data from the  statement.   The  $statement  parameter  can  be  a  previously  prepared
       statement handle, in which case the "prepare" is skipped.

       If any method fails, and "RaiseError" is not set, "selectrow_arrayref" will return undef.

       <u>"selectrow_hashref"</u>

         $hash_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectrow_hashref($statement);
         $hash_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectrow_hashref($statement, \%attr);
         $hash_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectrow_hashref($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

       This  utility  method combines "prepare", "execute" and "fetchrow_hashref" into a single call. It returns
       the first row of data from the  statement.   The  $statement  parameter  can  be  a  previously  prepared
       statement handle, in which case the "prepare" is skipped.

       If any method fails, and "RaiseError" is not set, "selectrow_hashref" will return undef.

       <u>"selectall_arrayref"</u>

         $ary_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref($statement);
         $ary_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref($statement, \%attr);
         $ary_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

       This  utility method combines "prepare", "execute" and "fetchall_arrayref" into a single call. It returns
       a reference to an array containing a reference to an array (or hash, see below)  for  each  row  of  data
       fetched.

       The  $statement  parameter  can be a previously prepared statement handle, in which case the "prepare" is
       skipped. This is recommended if the statement is going to be executed many times.

       If "RaiseError" is not set and any method except "fetchall_arrayref" fails then "selectall_arrayref" will
       return "undef"; if "fetchall_arrayref" fails then it will return with whatever data has been fetched thus
       far. You should check "$dbh-&gt;err" afterwards (or use the "RaiseError" attribute) to discover if the  data
       is complete or was truncated due to an error.

       The  "fetchall_arrayref"  method  called  by "selectall_arrayref" supports a $max_rows parameter. You can
       specify a value for $max_rows by including a '"MaxRows"' attribute in \%attr. In which case  <b>finish()</b>  is
       called for you after <b>fetchall_arrayref()</b> returns.

       The  "fetchall_arrayref"  method called by "selectall_arrayref" also supports a $slice parameter. You can
       specify a value for $slice by including  a  '"Slice"'  or  '"Columns"'  attribute  in  \%attr.  The  only
       difference  between  the  two  is  that if "Slice" is not defined and "Columns" is an array ref, then the
       array is assumed to contain column index values (which count  from  1),  rather  than  perl  array  index
       values.    In   which   case   the  array  is  copied  and  each  value  decremented  before  passing  to
       "/fetchall_arrayref".

       You may often want to fetch an array of rows where each row is stored as a hash. That can be done  simply
       using:

         my $emps = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref(
             "SELECT ename FROM emp ORDER BY ename",
             { Slice =&gt; {} }
         );
         foreach my $emp ( @$emps ) {
             print "Employee: $emp-&gt;{ename}\n";
         }

       Or, to fetch into an array instead of an array ref:

         @result = @{ $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref($sql, { Slice =&gt; {} }) };

       See "fetchall_arrayref" method for more details.

       <u>"selectall_array"</u>

         @ary = $dbh-&gt;selectall_array($statement);
         @ary = $dbh-&gt;selectall_array($statement, \%attr);
         @ary = $dbh-&gt;selectall_array($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

       This  is  a  convenience  wrapper  around  "selectall_arrayref" that returns the rows directly as a list,
       rather than a reference to an array of rows.

       Note that if "RaiseError" is not set then you can't tell the difference between returning no rows and  an
       error. Using RaiseError is best practice.

       The "selectall_array" method was added in DBI 1.635.

       <u>"selectall_hashref"</u>

         $hash_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectall_hashref($statement, $key_field);
         $hash_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectall_hashref($statement, $key_field, \%attr);
         $hash_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectall_hashref($statement, $key_field, \%attr, @bind_values);

       This utility method combines "prepare", "execute" and "fetchall_hashref" into a single call. It returns a
       reference to a hash containing one entry, at most, for each row, as returned by <b>fetchall_hashref()</b>.

       The  $statement  parameter  can be a previously prepared statement handle, in which case the "prepare" is
       skipped.  This is recommended if the statement is going to be executed many times.

       The $key_field parameter defines which column, or columns, are used as keys in the returned hash. It  can
       either  be  the name of a single field, or a reference to an array containing multiple field names. Using
       multiple names yields a tree of nested hashes.

       If a row has the same key as an earlier row then it replaces the earlier row.

       If any method except "fetchall_hashref" fails, and "RaiseError"  is  not  set,  "selectall_hashref"  will
       return  "undef".   If  "fetchall_hashref"  fails  and  "RaiseError"  is not set, then it will return with
       whatever data it has fetched thus far. $DBI::err should be checked to catch that.

       See <b>fetchall_hashref()</b> for more details.

       <u>"selectcol_arrayref"</u>

         $ary_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectcol_arrayref($statement);
         $ary_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectcol_arrayref($statement, \%attr);
         $ary_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectcol_arrayref($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

       This utility method combines "prepare", "execute", and fetching one column from  all  the  rows,  into  a
       single call. It returns a reference to an array containing the values of the first column from each row.

       The  $statement  parameter  can be a previously prepared statement handle, in which case the "prepare" is
       skipped. This is recommended if the statement is going to be executed many times.

       If any method except "fetch" fails,  and  "RaiseError"  is  not  set,  "selectcol_arrayref"  will  return
       "undef".   If  "fetch"  fails  and "RaiseError" is not set, then it will return with whatever data it has
       fetched thus far. $DBI::err should be checked to catch that.

       The "selectcol_arrayref" method defaults to pushing a single column value (the first) from each row  into
       the  result  array.  However, it can also push another column, or even multiple columns per row, into the
       result array. This behaviour can be specified via a '"Columns"' attribute which must be a ref to an array
       containing the column number or numbers to use. For example:

         # get array of id and name pairs:
         my $ary_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectcol_arrayref("select id, name from table", { Columns=&gt;[1,2] });
         my %hash = @$ary_ref; # build hash from key-value pairs so $hash{$id} =&gt; name

       You can specify a maximum number of rows to fetch by including a '"MaxRows"' attribute in \%attr.

       <u>"prepare"</u>

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($statement)          or die $dbh-&gt;errstr;
         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($statement, \%attr)  or die $dbh-&gt;errstr;

       Prepares a statement for later execution by the database engine and returns a reference  to  a  statement
       handle object.

       The  returned  statement  handle  can be used to get attributes of the statement and invoke the "execute"
       method. See "Statement Handle Methods".

       Drivers for engines without the concept of preparing a statement will typically just store the  statement
       in  the  returned handle and process it when "$sth-&gt;execute" is called. Such drivers are unlikely to give
       much useful information about the statement, such as "$sth-&gt;{NUM_OF_FIELDS}", until after "$sth-&gt;execute"
       has been called. Portable applications should take this into account.

       In general, DBI drivers do not parse the contents of  the  statement  (other  than  simply  counting  any
       Placeholders).   The  statement  is  passed directly to the database engine, sometimes known as pass-thru
       mode. This has advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, you can access all  the  functionality  of
       the  engine  being used. On the downside, you're limited if you're using a simple engine, and you need to
       take extra care if writing applications intended to be portable between engines.

       Portable applications should not assume that a new statement can be prepared and/or executed while  still
       fetching results from a previous statement.

       Some  command-line  SQL  tools  use  statement  terminators,  like  a semicolon, to indicate the end of a
       statement. Such terminators should not normally be used with the DBI.

       <u>"prepare_cached"</u>

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare_cached($statement)
         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare_cached($statement, \%attr)
         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare_cached($statement, \%attr, $if_active)

       Like "prepare" except that the statement handle returned will be stored in a  hash  associated  with  the
       $dbh.  If  another  call is made to "prepare_cached" with the same $statement and %attr parameter values,
       then the corresponding cached $sth will be returned without contacting the database server.  Be  sure  to
       understand the cautions and caveats noted below.

       The  $if_active  parameter  lets  you adjust the behaviour if an already cached statement handle is still
       Active.  There are several alternatives:

       <b>0</b>: A warning will be generated, and <b>finish()</b> will be called on the statement handle before it is
       returned.  This is the default behaviour if $if_active is not passed.
       <b>1</b>: <b>finish()</b> will be called on the statement handle, but the warning is suppressed.
       <b>2</b>: Disables any checking.
       <b>3</b>: The existing active statement handle will be removed from the cache and a new statement handle
       prepared and cached in its place. This is the safest option because it doesn't affect the state of the
       old handle, it just removes it from the cache. [Added in DBI 1.40]

       Here are some examples of "prepare_cached":

         sub insert_hash {
           my ($table, $field_values) = @_;
           # sort to keep field order, and thus sql, stable for prepare_cached
           my @fields = sort keys %$field_values;
           my @values = @{$field_values}{@fields};
           my $sql = sprintf "insert into %s (%s) values (%s)",
               $table, join(",", @fields), join(",", ("?")x@fields);
           my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare_cached($sql);
           return $sth-&gt;execute(@values);
         }

         sub search_hash {
           my ($table, $field_values) = @_;
           # sort to keep field order, and thus sql, stable for prepare_cached
           my @fields = sort keys %$field_values;
           my @values = @{$field_values}{@fields};
           my $qualifier = "";
           $qualifier = "where ".join(" and ", map { "$_=?" } @fields) if @fields;
           $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare_cached("SELECT * FROM $table $qualifier");
           return $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref($sth, {}, @values);
         }

       <u>Caveat</u> <u>emptor:</u> This caching can be useful in some applications, but it can also cause problems and should
       be used with care. Here is a contrived case where caching would cause a significant problem:

         my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare_cached('SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar=?');
         $sth-&gt;execute(...);
         while (my $data = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_hashref) {

           # later, in some other code called within the loop...
           my $sth2 = $dbh-&gt;prepare_cached('SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar=?');
           $sth2-&gt;execute(...);
           while (my $data2 = $sth2-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref) {
             do_stuff(...);
           }
         }

       In this example, since both handles are preparing the exact same statement, $sth2 will  not  be  its  own
       statement handle, but a duplicate of $sth returned from the cache. The results will certainly not be what
       you  expect.  Typically the inner fetch loop will work normally, fetching all the records and terminating
       when there are no more, but now that $sth is the same as $sth2 the outer fetch loop will also terminate.

       You'll know if you run into this problem because <b>prepare_cached()</b> will  generate  a  warning  by  default
       (when $if_active is false).

       The  cache  used  by  <b>prepare_cached()</b>  is keyed by both the statement and any attributes so you can also
       avoid this issue by doing something like:

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare_cached("...", { dbi_dummy =&gt; __FILE__.__LINE__ });

       which will ensure that prepare_cached only returns statements cached by that line of code in that  source
       file.

       Also,  to ensure the attributes passed are always the same, avoid passing references inline. For example,
       the Slice attribute is specified as a  reference.  Be  sure  to  declare  it  external  to  the  call  to
       <b>prepare_cached()</b>,  such  that a new hash reference is not created on every call. See "connect_cached" for
       more details and examples.

       If you'd like the cache to managed intelligently, you can tie the hashref returned by "CachedKids" to  an
       appropriate caching module, such as Tie::Cache::LRU:

         my $cache;
         tie %$cache, 'Tie::Cache::LRU', 500;
         $dbh-&gt;{CachedKids} = $cache;

       <u>"commit"</u>

         $rc  = $dbh-&gt;commit     or die $dbh-&gt;errstr;

       Commit  (make permanent) the most recent series of database changes if the database supports transactions
       and AutoCommit is off.

       If "AutoCommit" is on, then calling "commit" will issue a "commit ineffective with AutoCommit" warning.

       See also "Transactions" in the "FURTHER INFORMATION" section below.

       <u>"rollback"</u>

         $rc  = $dbh-&gt;rollback   or die $dbh-&gt;errstr;

       Rollback (undo) the most  recent  series  of  uncommitted  database  changes  if  the  database  supports
       transactions and AutoCommit is off.

       If  "AutoCommit"  is  on,  then  calling  "rollback"  will issue a "rollback ineffective with AutoCommit"
       warning.

       See also "Transactions" in the "FURTHER INFORMATION" section below.

       <u>"begin_work"</u>

         $rc  = $dbh-&gt;begin_work   or die $dbh-&gt;errstr;

       Enable transactions (by turning "AutoCommit" off) until the next call to "commit"  or  "rollback".  After
       the next "commit" or "rollback", "AutoCommit" will automatically be turned on again.

       If  "AutoCommit"  is already off when "begin_work" is called then it does nothing except return an error.
       If the driver does not support transactions then when "begin_work" attempts to set "AutoCommit"  off  the
       driver will trigger a fatal error.

       See also "Transactions" in the "FURTHER INFORMATION" section below.

       <u>"disconnect"</u>

         $rc = $dbh-&gt;disconnect  or warn $dbh-&gt;errstr;

       Disconnects the database from the database handle. "disconnect" is typically only used before exiting the
       program. The handle is of little use after disconnecting.

       The  transaction  behaviour of the "disconnect" method is, sadly, undefined.  Some database systems (such
       as Oracle and Ingres) will automatically commit any outstanding changes, but others  (such  as  Informix)
       will  rollback  any  outstanding  changes.   Applications  not  using "AutoCommit" should explicitly call
       "commit" or "rollback" before calling "disconnect".

       The database is automatically disconnected by the "DESTROY" method if still connected when there  are  no
       longer  any  references  to  the  handle.   The  "DESTROY"  method for each driver should implicitly call
       "rollback" to  undo  any  uncommitted  changes.  This  is  vital  behaviour  to  ensure  that  incomplete
       transactions  don't  get  committed  simply  because Perl calls "DESTROY" on every object before exiting.
       Also, do not rely on the order of object destruction during "global destruction", as it is undefined.

       Generally, if you want your changes to be committed or rolled back when you disconnect, then  you  should
       explicitly call "commit" or "rollback" before disconnecting.

       If  you  disconnect from a database while you still have active statement handles (e.g., SELECT statement
       handles that may have more data to fetch), you will get a warning. The warning may indicate that a  fetch
       loop  terminated  early, perhaps due to an uncaught error.  To avoid the warning call the "finish" method
       on the active handles.

       <u>"ping"</u>

         $rc = $dbh-&gt;ping;

       Attempts to determine, in a reasonably efficient way, if the database server is  still  running  and  the
       connection  to  it  is  still  working.   Individual  drivers  should implement this function in the most
       suitable manner for their database engine.

       The current <u>default</u> implementation always returns true without  actually  doing  anything.  Actually,  it
       returns  ""0  but  true"" which is true but zero. That way you can tell if the return value is genuine or
       just the default. Drivers should override this method with one that does the right thing for  their  type
       of database.

       Few  applications  would  have direct use for this method. See the specialized Apache::DBI module for one
       example usage.

       <u>"get_info"</u>

         $value = $dbh-&gt;get_info( $info_type );

       Returns information about the implementation, i.e. driver and data source capabilities, restrictions etc.
       It returns "undef" for unknown or unimplemented information types. For example:

         $database_version  = $dbh-&gt;get_info(  18 ); # SQL_DBMS_VER
         $max_select_tables = $dbh-&gt;get_info( 106 ); # SQL_MAXIMUM_TABLES_IN_SELECT

       See "Standards Reference Information" for more detailed information about the information types and their
       meanings and possible return values.

       The DBI::Const::GetInfoType module exports a %GetInfoType hash that can be used to map info type names to
       numbers. For example:

         $database_version = $dbh-&gt;get_info( $GetInfoType{SQL_DBMS_VER} );

       The  names  are  a  merging  of  the  ANSI  and  ODBC  standards  (which  differ  in  some  cases).   See
       DBI::Const::GetInfoType for more details.

       Because  some DBI methods make use of <b>get_info()</b>, drivers are strongly encouraged to support <u>at</u> <u>least</u> the
       following very minimal set of information types to ensure the DBI itself works properly:

        Type  Name                        Example A     Example B
        ----  --------------------------  ------------  ----------------
          17  SQL_DBMS_NAME               'ACCESS'      'Oracle'
          18  SQL_DBMS_VER                '03.50.0000'  '08.01.0721 ...'
          29  SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR   '`'           '"'
          41  SQL_CATALOG_NAME_SEPARATOR  '.'           '@'
         114  SQL_CATALOG_LOCATION        1             2

       Values from 9000 to 9999 for get_info are officially reserved for use by Perl DBI.  Values in that  range
       which have been assigned a meaning are defined here:

       9000: true if a backslash character ("\") before placeholder-like text (e.g. "?", ":foo") will prevent it
       being treated as a placeholder by the driver.  The backslash will be removed before the text is passed to
       the backend.

       <u>"table_info"</u>

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;table_info( $catalog, $schema, $table, $type );
         $sth = $dbh-&gt;table_info( $catalog, $schema, $table, $type, \%attr );

         # then $sth-&gt;fetchall_arrayref or $sth-&gt;fetchall_hashref etc

       Returns  an  active  statement  handle  that can be used to fetch information about tables and views that
       exist in the database.

       The arguments $catalog, $schema and $table may accept search patterns according to  the  database/driver,
       for  example:  $table  = '%FOO%'; Remember that the underscore character ('"_"') is a search pattern that
       means match any character, so 'FOO_%' is the  same  as  'FOO%'  and  'FOO_BAR%'  will  match  names  like
       'FOO1BAR'.

       The  value of $type is a comma-separated list of one or more types of tables to be returned in the result
       set. Each value may optionally be quoted, e.g.:

         $type = "TABLE";
         $type = "'TABLE','VIEW'";

       In addition the following special cases may also be supported by some drivers:

       •   If the value of $catalog is '%' and $schema and  $table  name  are  empty  strings,  the  result  set
           contains a list of catalog names.  For example:

             $sth = $dbh-&gt;table_info('%', '', '');

       •   If  the  value of $schema is '%' and $catalog and $table are empty strings, the result set contains a
           list of schema names.

       •   If the value of $type is '%' and $catalog, $schema, and $table are all empty strings, the result  set
           contains a list of table types.

       If  your driver doesn't support one or more of the selection filter parameters then you may get back more
       than you asked for and can do the filtering yourself.

       This method can be expensive, and can return  a  large  amount  of  data.   (For  example,  small  Oracle
       installation  returns  over 2000 rows.)  So it's a good idea to use the filters to limit the data as much
       as possible.

       The statement handle returned has at least the following fields in the order show  below.  Other  fields,
       after these, may also be present.

       <b>TABLE_CAT</b>:  Table  catalog identifier. This field is NULL ("undef") if not applicable to the data source,
       which is usually the case. This field is empty if not applicable to the table.

       <b>TABLE_SCHEM</b>: The name of the schema containing the TABLE_NAME value.  This field is NULL ("undef") if not
       applicable to data source, and empty if not applicable to the table.

       <b>TABLE_NAME</b>: Name of the table (or view, synonym, etc).

       <b>TABLE_TYPE</b>: One of the following: "TABLE", "VIEW", "SYSTEM TABLE", "GLOBAL TEMPORARY", "LOCAL TEMPORARY",
       "ALIAS", "SYNONYM" or a type identifier that is specific to the data source.

       <b>REMARKS</b>: A description of the table. May be NULL ("undef").

       Note that "table_info" might not return records for all tables.  Applications can  use  any  valid  table
       regardless of whether it's returned by "table_info".

       See also "tables", "Catalog Methods" and "Standards Reference Information".

       <u>"column_info"</u>

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;column_info( $catalog, $schema, $table, $column );

         # then $sth-&gt;fetchall_arrayref or $sth-&gt;fetchall_hashref etc

       Returns  an  active  statement  handle  that  can be used to fetch information about columns in specified
       tables.

       The arguments $schema, $table and $column may accept search patterns according  to  the  database/driver,
       for example: $table = '%FOO%';

       Note:  The  support  for  the selection criteria is driver specific. If the driver doesn't support one or
       more of them then you may get back more than you asked for and can do the filtering yourself.

       Note: If your driver does not support column_info an undef is returned.  This is distinct from asking for
       something which does not exist in a driver which supports column_info as a valid statement handle  to  an
       empty result-set will be returned in this case.

       If  the  arguments  don't match any tables then you'll still get a statement handle, it'll just return no
       rows.

       The statement handle returned has at least the following fields in the order shown below.  Other  fields,
       after these, may also be present.

       <b>TABLE_CAT</b>:  The  catalog  identifier.  This field is NULL ("undef") if not applicable to the data source,
       which is often the case.  This field is empty if not applicable to the table.

       <b>TABLE_SCHEM</b>: The schema identifier.  This field is NULL ("undef") if not applicable to the  data  source,
       and empty if not applicable to the table.

       <b>TABLE_NAME</b>:  The  table identifier.  Note: A driver may provide column metadata not only for base tables,
       but also for derived objects like SYNONYMS etc.

       <b>COLUMN_NAME</b>: The column identifier.

       <b>DATA_TYPE</b>: The concise data type code.

       <b>TYPE_NAME</b>: A data source dependent data type name.

       <b>COLUMN_SIZE</b>: The column size.  This is the maximum length in characters for  character  data  types,  the
       number  of  digits  or bits for numeric data types or the length in the representation of temporal types.
       See the relevant specifications for detailed information.

       <b>BUFFER_LENGTH</b>: The length in bytes of transferred data.

       <b>DECIMAL_DIGITS</b>: The total number of significant digits to the right of the decimal point.

       <b>NUM_PREC_RADIX</b>: The radix for numeric precision.  The value is 10 or 2 for numeric data  types  and  NULL
       ("undef") if not applicable.

       <b>NULLABLE</b>: Indicates if a column can accept NULLs.  The following values are defined:

         SQL_NO_NULLS          0
         SQL_NULLABLE          1
         SQL_NULLABLE_UNKNOWN  2

       <b>REMARKS</b>: A description of the column.

       <b>COLUMN_DEF</b>: The default value of the column, in a format that can be used directly in an SQL statement.

       Note  that  this  may be an expression and not simply the text used for the default value in the original
       CREATE TABLE statement. For example, given:

           col1 <a href="../man30/char.30.html">char</a>(30) default current_user    -- a 'function'
           col2 <a href="../man30/char.30.html">char</a>(30) default 'string'        -- a string literal

       where "current_user" is the name of a function, the corresponding "COLUMN_DEF" values would be:

           Database        col1                     col2
           --------        ----                     ----
           Oracle:         current_user             'string'
           Postgres:       "current_user"()         'string'::text
           MS SQL:         (user_name())            ('string')

       <b>SQL_DATA_TYPE</b>: The SQL data type.

       <b>SQL_DATETIME_SUB</b>: The subtype code for datetime and interval data types.

       <b>CHAR_OCTET_LENGTH</b>: The maximum length in bytes of a character or binary data type column.

       <b>ORDINAL_POSITION</b>: The column sequence number (starting with 1).

       <b>IS_NULLABLE</b>: Indicates if the column can accept NULLs.  Possible values are: 'NO', 'YES' and ''.

       SQL/CLI defines the following additional columns:

         CHAR_SET_CAT
         CHAR_SET_SCHEM
         CHAR_SET_NAME
         COLLATION_CAT
         COLLATION_SCHEM
         COLLATION_NAME
         UDT_CAT
         UDT_SCHEM
         UDT_NAME
         DOMAIN_CAT
         DOMAIN_SCHEM
         DOMAIN_NAME
         SCOPE_CAT
         SCOPE_SCHEM
         SCOPE_NAME
         MAX_CARDINALITY
         DTD_IDENTIFIER
         IS_SELF_REF

       Drivers capable of supplying any of those values should do so in  the  corresponding  column  and  supply
       undef values for the others.

       Drivers  wishing  to  provide  extra  database/driver  specific information should do so in extra columns
       beyond all those listed above, and use lowercase field  names  with  the  driver-specific  prefix  (i.e.,
       'ora_...'). Applications accessing such fields should do so by name and not by column number.

       The result set is ordered by TABLE_CAT, TABLE_SCHEM, TABLE_NAME and ORDINAL_POSITION.

       Note:  There  is  some  overlap  with statement handle attributes (in perl) and SQLDescribeCol (in ODBC).
       However, SQLColumns provides more metadata.

       See also "Catalog Methods" and "Standards Reference Information".

       <u>"primary_key_info"</u>

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;primary_key_info( $catalog, $schema, $table );

         # then $sth-&gt;fetchall_arrayref or $sth-&gt;fetchall_hashref etc

       Returns an active statement handle that can be used to fetch information about columns that make  up  the
       primary key for a table.  The arguments don't accept search patterns (unlike <b>table_info()</b>).

       The  statement  handle will return one row per column, ordered by TABLE_CAT, TABLE_SCHEM, TABLE_NAME, and
       KEY_SEQ.  If there is no primary key then the statement handle will fetch no rows.

       Note: The support for the selection criteria, such as  $catalog,  is  driver  specific.   If  the  driver
       doesn't support catalogs and/or schemas, it may ignore these criteria.

       The  statement  handle returned has at least the following fields in the order shown below. Other fields,
       after these, may also be present.

       <b>TABLE_CAT</b>: The catalog identifier.  This field is NULL ("undef") if not applicable to  the  data  source,
       which is often the case.  This field is empty if not applicable to the table.

       <b>TABLE_SCHEM</b>:  The  schema identifier.  This field is NULL ("undef") if not applicable to the data source,
       and empty if not applicable to the table.

       <b>TABLE_NAME</b>: The table identifier.

       <b>COLUMN_NAME</b>: The column identifier.

       <b>KEY_SEQ</b>: The column sequence number (starting with 1).  Note: This field  is  named  <b>ORDINAL_POSITION</b>  in
       SQL/CLI.

       <b>PK_NAME</b>:  The  primary  key constraint identifier.  This field is NULL ("undef") if not applicable to the
       data source.

       See also "Catalog Methods" and "Standards Reference Information".

       <u>"primary_key"</u>

         @key_column_names = $dbh-&gt;primary_key( $catalog, $schema, $table );

       Simple interface to the <b>primary_key_info()</b> method. Returns a list of the column names that  comprise  the
       primary  key  of  the specified table.  The list is in primary key column sequence order.  If there is no
       primary key then an empty list is returned.

       <u>"foreign_key_info"</u>

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;foreign_key_info( $pk_catalog, $pk_schema, $pk_table
                                      , $fk_catalog, $fk_schema, $fk_table );

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;foreign_key_info( $pk_catalog, $pk_schema, $pk_table
                                      , $fk_catalog, $fk_schema, $fk_table
                                      , \%attr );

         # then $sth-&gt;fetchall_arrayref or $sth-&gt;fetchall_hashref etc

       Returns an active statement handle that can be used to fetch information about  foreign  keys  in  and/or
       referencing the specified table(s).  The arguments don't accept search patterns (unlike <b>table_info()</b>).

       $pk_catalog, $pk_schema, $pk_table identify the primary (unique) key table (<b>PKT</b>).

       $fk_catalog, $fk_schema, $fk_table identify the foreign key table (<b>FKT</b>).

       If  both <b>PKT</b> and <b>FKT</b> are given, the function returns the foreign key, if any, in table <b>FKT</b> that refers to
       the primary (unique) key of table <b>PKT</b>.  (Note: In SQL/CLI, the result is implementation-defined.)

       If only <b>PKT</b> is given, then the result set contains the primary key of that table  and  all  foreign  keys
       that refer to it.

       If only <b>FKT</b> is given, then the result set contains all foreign keys in that table and the primary keys to
       which they refer.  (Note: In SQL/CLI, the result includes unique keys too.)

       For example:

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;foreign_key_info( undef, $user, 'master');
         $sth = $dbh-&gt;foreign_key_info( undef, undef,   undef , undef, $user, 'detail');
         $sth = $dbh-&gt;foreign_key_info( undef, $user, 'master', undef, $user, 'detail');

         # then $sth-&gt;fetchall_arrayref or $sth-&gt;fetchall_hashref etc

       Note:  The  support  for  the  selection  criteria,  such as $catalog, is driver specific.  If the driver
       doesn't support catalogs and/or schemas, it may ignore these criteria.

       The statement handle returned has the following fields in the order  shown  below.   Because  ODBC  never
       includes  unique keys, they define different columns in the result set than SQL/CLI. SQL/CLI column names
       are shown in parentheses.

       <b>PKTABLE_CAT</b>    <b>(</b> <b>UK_TABLE_CAT</b>      <b>)</b>: The primary (unique) key table catalog identifier.  This  field  is
       NULL ("undef") if not applicable to the data source, which is often the case.  This field is empty if not
       applicable to the table.

       <b>PKTABLE_SCHEM</b>   <b>(</b>  <b>UK_TABLE_SCHEM</b>     <b>)</b>: The primary (unique) key table schema identifier.  This field is
       NULL ("undef") if not applicable to the data source, and empty if not applicable to the table.

       <b>PKTABLE_NAME</b>   <b>(</b> <b>UK_TABLE_NAME</b>     <b>)</b>: The primary (unique) key table identifier.

       <b>PKCOLUMN_NAME</b>  <b>(UK_COLUMN_NAME</b>    <b>)</b>: The primary (unique) key column identifier.

       <b>FKTABLE_CAT</b>    <b>(</b> <b>FK_TABLE_CAT</b>      <b>)</b>: The foreign key table  catalog  identifier.   This  field  is  NULL
       ("undef")  if  not  applicable  to  the data source, which is often the case.  This field is empty if not
       applicable to the table.

       <b>FKTABLE_SCHEM</b>  <b>(</b> <b>FK_TABLE_SCHEM</b>    <b>)</b>: The foreign key  table  schema  identifier.   This  field  is  NULL
       ("undef") if not applicable to the data source, and empty if not applicable to the table.

       <b>FKTABLE_NAME</b>   <b>(</b> <b>FK_TABLE_NAME</b>     <b>)</b>: The foreign key table identifier.

       <b>FKCOLUMN_NAME</b>  <b>(</b> <b>FK_COLUMN_NAME</b>    <b>)</b>: The foreign key column identifier.

       <b>KEY_SEQ</b>        <b>(</b> <b>ORDINAL_POSITION</b>  <b>)</b>: The column sequence number (starting with 1).

       <b>UPDATE_RULE</b>     <b>(</b>  <b>UPDATE_RULE</b>        <b>)</b>: The referential action for the UPDATE rule.  The following codes
       are defined:

         CASCADE              0
         RESTRICT             1
         SET NULL             2
         NO ACTION            3
         SET DEFAULT          4

       <b>DELETE_RULE</b>    <b>(</b> <b>DELETE_RULE</b>       <b>)</b>: The referential action for the DELETE rule.  The codes are the same
       as for UPDATE_RULE.

       <b>FK_NAME</b>        <b>(</b> <b>FK_NAME</b>           <b>)</b>: The foreign key name.

       <b>PK_NAME</b>        <b>(</b> <b>UK_NAME</b>           <b>)</b>: The primary (unique) key name.

       <b>DEFERRABILITY</b>  <b>(</b> <b>DEFERABILITY</b>      <b>)</b>: The deferrability of the foreign  key  constraint.   The  following
       codes are defined:

         INITIALLY DEFERRED   5
         INITIALLY IMMEDIATE  6
         NOT DEFERRABLE       7

                       <b>(</b>  <b>UNIQUE_OR_PRIMARY</b> <b>)</b>: This column is necessary if a driver includes all candidate (i.e.
       primary and alternate) keys in the result set (as specified by SQL/CLI).  The value  of  this  column  is
       UNIQUE if the foreign key references an alternate key and PRIMARY if the foreign key references a primary
       key, or it may be undefined if the driver doesn't have access to the information.

       See also "Catalog Methods" and "Standards Reference Information".

       <u>"statistics_info"</u>

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;statistics_info( $catalog, $schema, $table, $unique_only, $quick );

         # then $sth-&gt;fetchall_arrayref or $sth-&gt;fetchall_hashref etc

       Returns  an  active  statement handle that can be used to fetch statistical information about a table and
       its indexes.

       The arguments don't accept search patterns (unlike "table_info").

       If the boolean argument $unique_only is true, only UNIQUE indexes will be returned  in  the  result  set,
       otherwise all indexes will be returned.

       If the boolean argument $quick is set, the actual statistical information columns (CARDINALITY and PAGES)
       will  only  be  returned  if  they are readily available from the server, and might not be current.  Some
       databases may return stale statistics or no statistics at all with this flag set.

       The statement handle will return at most one row per column name per index, plus at most one row for  the
       entire table itself, ordered by NON_UNIQUE, TYPE, INDEX_QUALIFIER, INDEX_NAME, and ORDINAL_POSITION.

       Note:  The  support  for  the  selection  criteria,  such as $catalog, is driver specific.  If the driver
       doesn't support catalogs and/or schemas, it may ignore these criteria.

       The statement handle returned has at least the following fields in the order shown below.  Other  fields,
       after these, may also be present.

       <b>TABLE_CAT</b>:  The  catalog  identifier.  This field is NULL ("undef") if not applicable to the data source,
       which is often the case.  This field is empty if not applicable to the table.

       <b>TABLE_SCHEM</b>: The schema identifier.  This field is NULL ("undef") if not applicable to the  data  source,
       and empty if not applicable to the table.

       <b>TABLE_NAME</b>: The table identifier.

       <b>NON_UNIQUE</b>: Unique index indicator.  Returns 0 for unique indexes, 1 for non-unique indexes

       <b>INDEX_QUALIFIER</b>:  Index qualifier identifier.  The identifier that is used to qualify the index name when
       doing a "DROP INDEX"; NULL ("undef") is returned if an index qualifier  is  not  supported  by  the  data
       source.   If  a non-NULL (defined) value is returned in this column, it must be used to qualify the index
       name on a "DROP INDEX" statement; otherwise, the TABLE_SCHEM should be used to qualify the index name.

       <b>INDEX_NAME</b>: The index identifier.

       <b>TYPE</b>: The type of information being returned.  Can be any of  the  following  values:  'table',  'btree',
       'clustered', 'content', 'hashed', or 'other'.

       In  the  case that this field is 'table', all fields other than TABLE_CAT, TABLE_SCHEM, TABLE_NAME, TYPE,
       CARDINALITY, and PAGES will be NULL ("undef").

       <b>ORDINAL_POSITION</b>: Column sequence number (starting with 1).

       <b>COLUMN_NAME</b>: The column identifier.

       <b>ASC_OR_DESC</b>: Column sort sequence.  "A" for Ascending, "D" for  Descending,  or  NULL  ("undef")  if  not
       supported for this index.

       <b>CARDINALITY</b>:  Cardinality of the table or index.  For indexes, this is the number of unique values in the
       index.  For tables, this is the number of rows in the table.  If not supported, the value  will  be  NULL
       ("undef").

       <b>PAGES</b>:  Number  of  storage  pages used by this table or index.  If not supported, the value will be NULL
       ("undef").

       <b>FILTER_CONDITION</b>: The index filter condition as a string.  If the index is not a filtered  index,  or  it
       cannot  be  determined whether the index is a filtered index, this value is NULL ("undef").  If the index
       is a filtered index, but the filter condition cannot be determined, this value is the  empty  string  ''.
       Otherwise it will be the literal filter condition as a string, such as "SALARY &lt;= 4500".

       See also "Catalog Methods" and "Standards Reference Information".

       <u>"tables"</u>

         @names = $dbh-&gt;tables( $catalog, $schema, $table, $type );
         @names = $dbh-&gt;tables;        # deprecated

       Simple  interface  to  <b>table_info()</b>.  Returns  a  list  of  matching  table  names,  possibly including a
       catalog/schema prefix.

       See "table_info" for a description of the parameters.

       If "$dbh-&gt;<a href="../man29/get_info.29.html">get_info</a>(29)"  returns  true  (29  is  SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR)  then  the  table  names  are
       constructed and quoted by "quote_identifier" to ensure they are usable even if they contain whitespace or
       reserved words etc. This means that the table names returned will include quote characters.

       <u>"type_info_all"</u>

         $type_info_all = $dbh-&gt;type_info_all;

       Returns  a  reference  to  an array which holds information about each data type variant supported by the
       database and driver. The array and its contents should be treated as read-only.

       The first item is a reference to an 'index' hash of "Name ="&gt; "Index" pairs.  The  items  following  that
       are  references  to arrays, one per supported data type variant. The leading index hash defines the names
       and order of the fields within the arrays that follow it.  For example:

         $type_info_all = [
           {   TYPE_NAME         =&gt; 0,
               DATA_TYPE         =&gt; 1,
               COLUMN_SIZE       =&gt; 2,     # was PRECISION originally

               NUM_PREC_RADIX    =&gt; 17,
               INTERVAL_PRECISION=&gt; 18,
           },
           [ 'VARCHAR', SQL_VARCHAR,
               undef, "'","'", undef,0, 1,1,0,0,0,undef,1,255, undef
           ],
           [ 'INTEGER', SQL_INTEGER,
               undef,  "", "", undef,0, 0,1,0,0,0,undef,0,  0, 10
           ],
         ];

       More than one row may have the same value in the "DATA_TYPE" field if there are different ways  to  spell
       the  type  name  and/or  there are variants of the type with different attributes (e.g., with and without
       "AUTO_UNIQUE_VALUE" set, with and without "UNSIGNED_ATTRIBUTE", etc).

       The rows are ordered by "DATA_TYPE" first and then by how closely each type  maps  to  the  corresponding
       ODBC SQL data type, closest first.

       The meaning of the fields is described in the documentation for the "type_info" method.

       An  'index'  hash  is  provided  so you don't need to rely on index values defined above.  However, using
       DBD::ODBC with some old ODBC drivers may return older names, shown as  comments  in  the  example  above.
       Another  issue  with  the  index  hash  is  that the lettercase of the keys is not defined. It is usually
       uppercase, as show here, but drivers may return names with any lettercase.

       Drivers are also free to return extra driver-specific columns of information -  though  it's  recommended
       that they start at column index 50 to leave room for expansion of the DBI/ODBC specification.

       The  <b>type_info_all()</b> method is not normally used directly.  The "type_info" method provides a more usable
       and useful interface to the data.

       <u>"type_info"</u>

         @type_info = $dbh-&gt;type_info($data_type);

       Returns a list of hash references holding information about one or more variants of $data_type. The  list
       is ordered by "DATA_TYPE" first and then by how closely each type maps to the corresponding ODBC SQL data
       type, closest first.  If called in a scalar context then only the first (best) element is returned.

       If  $data_type  is  undefined  or  "SQL_ALL_TYPES",  then  the list will contain hashes for all data type
       variants supported by the database and driver.

       If $data_type is an array reference then "type_info" returns the information for the <u>first</u>  type  in  the
       array that has any matches.

       The  keys  of  the  hash  follow  the  same  letter  case conventions as the rest of the DBI (see "Naming
       Conventions and Name Space"). The following uppercase items should always exist, though may be undef:

       TYPE_NAME (string)
           Data type name for use in CREATE TABLE statements etc.

       DATA_TYPE (integer)
           SQL data type number.

       COLUMN_SIZE (integer)
           For numeric types, this is either the total number of digits (if the NUM_PREC_RADIX value is  10)  or
           the total number of bits allowed in the column (if NUM_PREC_RADIX is 2).

           For string types, this is the maximum size of the string in characters.

           For date and interval types, this is the maximum number of characters needed to display the value.

       LITERAL_PREFIX (string)
           Characters used to prefix a literal. A typical prefix is ""'"" for characters, or possibly ""0x"" for
           binary values passed as hexadecimal.  NULL ("undef") is returned for data types for which this is not
           applicable.

       LITERAL_SUFFIX (string)
           Characters  used to suffix a literal. Typically ""'"" for characters.  NULL ("undef") is returned for
           data types where this is not applicable.

       CREATE_PARAMS (string)
           Parameter names for data type definition. For example,  "CREATE_PARAMS"  for  a  "DECIMAL"  would  be
           ""precision,scale""  if  the  DECIMAL  type  should be declared as "DECIMAL("<u>precision,scale</u>")" where
           <u>precision</u> and <u>scale</u> are integer values.  For a "VARCHAR" it would be ""max length"".  NULL  ("undef")
           is returned for data types for which this is not applicable.

       NULLABLE (integer)
           Indicates  whether  the  data  type  accepts  a  NULL  value: 0 or an empty string = no, 1 = yes, 2 =
           unknown.

       CASE_SENSITIVE (boolean)
           Indicates whether the data type is case sensitive in collations and comparisons.

       SEARCHABLE (integer)
           Indicates how the data type can be used in a WHERE clause, as follows:

             0 - Cannot be used in a WHERE clause
             1 - Only with a LIKE predicate
             2 - All comparison operators except LIKE
             3 - Can be used in a WHERE clause with any comparison operator

       UNSIGNED_ATTRIBUTE (boolean)
           Indicates whether the data type is unsigned.  NULL ("undef") is returned for  data  types  for  which
           this is not applicable.

       FIXED_PREC_SCALE (boolean)
           Indicates whether the data type always has the same precision and scale (such as a money type).  NULL
           ("undef") is returned for data types for which this is not applicable.

       AUTO_UNIQUE_VALUE (boolean)
           Indicates  whether  a  column of this data type is automatically set to a unique value whenever a new
           row is inserted.  NULL ("undef") is returned for data types for which this is not applicable.

       LOCAL_TYPE_NAME (string)
           Localized version of the "TYPE_NAME" for use in dialog with users.  NULL ("undef") is returned  if  a
           localized name is not available (in which case "TYPE_NAME" should be used).

       MINIMUM_SCALE (integer)
           The  minimum scale of the data type. If a data type has a fixed scale, then "MAXIMUM_SCALE" holds the
           same value.  NULL ("undef") is returned for data types for which this is not applicable.

       MAXIMUM_SCALE (integer)
           The maximum scale of the data type. If a data type has a fixed scale, then "MINIMUM_SCALE" holds  the
           same value.  NULL ("undef") is returned for data types for which this is not applicable.

       SQL_DATA_TYPE (integer)
           This  column is the same as the "DATA_TYPE" column, except for interval and datetime data types.  For
           interval  and  datetime  data  types,  the  "SQL_DATA_TYPE"  field  will  return  "SQL_INTERVAL"   or
           "SQL_DATETIME",  and  the  "SQL_DATETIME_SUB"  field  below  will return the subcode for the specific
           interval or datetime data type. If this field is NULL, then the driver does not support or report  on
           interval or datetime subtypes.

       SQL_DATETIME_SUB (integer)
           For  interval  or  datetime  data  types,  where the "SQL_DATA_TYPE" field above is "SQL_INTERVAL" or
           "SQL_DATETIME", this field will hold the <u>subcode</u> for the specific interval  or  datetime  data  type.
           Otherwise it will be NULL ("undef").

           Although  not  mentioned explicitly in the standards, it seems there is a simple relationship between
           these values:

             DATA_TYPE == (10 * SQL_DATA_TYPE) + SQL_DATETIME_SUB

       NUM_PREC_RADIX (integer)
           The radix value of the data type. For approximate numeric types, "NUM_PREC_RADIX" contains the  value
           2  and "COLUMN_SIZE" holds the number of bits. For exact numeric types, "NUM_PREC_RADIX" contains the
           value 10 and "COLUMN_SIZE" holds the number of decimal digits. NULL ("undef") is returned either  for
           data types for which this is not applicable or if the driver cannot report this information.

       INTERVAL_PRECISION (integer)
           The  interval  leading precision for interval types. NULL is returned either for data types for which
           this is not applicable or if the driver cannot report this information.

       For example, to find the type name for the fields in a select statement you can do:

         @names = map { scalar $dbh-&gt;type_info($_)-&gt;{TYPE_NAME} } @{ $sth-&gt;{TYPE} }

       Since DBI and ODBC drivers vary in how they map their types into the ISO standard types you may  need  to
       search for more than one type.  Here's an example looking for a usable type to store a date:

         $my_date_type = $dbh-&gt;type_info( [ SQL_DATE, SQL_TIMESTAMP ] );

       Similarly,  to  more  reliably  find  a  type to store small integers, you could use a list starting with
       "SQL_SMALLINT", "SQL_INTEGER", "SQL_DECIMAL", etc.

       See also "Standards Reference Information".

       <u>"quote"</u>

         $sql = $dbh-&gt;quote($value);
         $sql = $dbh-&gt;quote($value, $data_type);

       Quote a string literal for use as a literal value in an SQL statement, by escaping any special characters
       (such as quotation marks) contained within the string and adding the required  type  of  outer  quotation
       marks.

         $sql = sprintf "SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE baz = %s",
                       $dbh-&gt;quote("Don't");

       For  most  database  types,  at  least  those  that conform to SQL standards, quote would return 'Don''t'
       (including the outer quotation marks). For others it may return something like 'Don\'t'

       An undefined $value value will be returned as the string "NULL" (without single quotation marks) to match
       how NULLs are represented in SQL.

       If $data_type is supplied, it is used to try to determine the required quoting  behaviour  by  using  the
       information  returned  by  "type_info".   As  a special case, the standard numeric types are optimized to
       return $value without calling "type_info".

       Quote will probably <u>not</u> be able to deal with all possible input (such as binary data or  data  containing
       newlines), and is not related in any way with escaping or quoting shell meta-characters.

       It  is valid for the <b>quote()</b> method to return an SQL expression that evaluates to the desired string. For
       example:

         $quoted = $dbh-&gt;quote("one\ntwo\0three")

       may return something like:

         CONCAT('one', <a href="../man12/CHAR.12.html">CHAR</a>(12), 'two', <a href="../man0/CHAR.0.html">CHAR</a>(0), 'three')

       The <b>quote()</b> method should <u>not</u> be used with "Placeholders and Bind Values".

       <u>"quote_identifier"</u>

         $sql = $dbh-&gt;quote_identifier( $name );
         $sql = $dbh-&gt;quote_identifier( $catalog, $schema, $table, \%attr );

       Quote an identifier (table name etc.) for use in an SQL statement, by  escaping  any  special  characters
       (such as double quotation marks) it contains and adding the required type of outer quotation marks.

       Undefined  names  are ignored and the remainder are quoted and then joined together, typically with a dot
       (".") character. For example:

         $id = $dbh-&gt;quote_identifier( undef, 'Her schema', 'My table' );

       would, for most database types, return "Her  schema"."My  table"  (including  all  the  double  quotation
       marks).

       If  three  names  are  supplied  then  the first is assumed to be a catalog name and special rules may be
       applied based on what "get_info" returns for  SQL_CATALOG_NAME_SEPARATOR  (41)  and  SQL_CATALOG_LOCATION
       (114).  For example, for Oracle:

         $id = $dbh-&gt;quote_identifier( 'link', 'schema', 'table' );

       would return "schema"."table"@"link".

       <u>"take_imp_data"</u>

         $imp_data = $dbh-&gt;take_imp_data;

       Leaves  the  $dbh in an almost dead, zombie-like, state and returns a binary string of raw implementation
       data from the driver which describes  the  current  database  connection.  Effectively  it  detaches  the
       underlying  database  API  connection data from the DBI handle.  After calling <b>take_imp_data()</b>, all other
       methods except "DESTROY" will generate a warning and return undef.

       Why would you want to do this?  You  don't,  forget  I  even  mentioned  it.   Unless,  that  is,  you're
       implementing something advanced like a multi-threaded connection pool like "DBI::Pool".

       The  returned  $imp_data can be passed as a "dbi_imp_data" attribute to a later <b>connect()</b> call, even in a
       separate thread in the same process, where the driver can use it to 'adopt' the existing connection  that
       the implementation data was taken from.

       Some things to keep in mind...

       <b>*</b>  the $imp_data holds the only reference to the underlying database API connection data. That connection
       is still 'live' and won't be cleaned up properly unless the $imp_data is used to create a new $dbh  which
       is then allowed to <b>disconnect()</b> normally.

       <b>*</b>  using  the same $imp_data to create more than one other new $dbh at a time may well lead to unpleasant
       problems. Don't do that.

       Any child statement handles are effectively destroyed when <b>take_imp_data()</b> is called.

       The "take_imp_data" method was added in DBI 1.36 but wasn't useful till 1.49.

   <b>Database</b> <b>Handle</b> <b>Attributes</b>
       This section describes attributes specific to database handles.

       Changes to these database handle attributes do not affect any other existing or future database handles.

       Attempting to set or get the value of an unknown  attribute  generates  a  warning,  except  for  private
       driver-specific attributes (which all have names starting with a lowercase letter).

       Example:

         $h-&gt;{AutoCommit} = ...;       # set/write
         ... = $h-&gt;{AutoCommit};       # get/read

       <u>"AutoCommit"</u>

       Type: boolean

       If  true,  then  database  changes  cannot  be  rolled-back  (undone).   If  false, then database changes
       automatically occur within a "transaction", which must either be  committed  or  rolled  back  using  the
       "commit" or "rollback" methods.

       Drivers  should  always  default to "AutoCommit" mode (an unfortunate choice largely forced on the DBI by
       ODBC and JDBC conventions.)

       Attempting to set "AutoCommit" to an unsupported value is a fatal error.  This is an important feature of
       the DBI. Applications that need full transaction behaviour can  set  "$dbh-&gt;{AutoCommit}  =  0"  (or  set
       "AutoCommit" to 0 via "connect") without having to check that the value was assigned successfully.

       For the purposes of this description, we can divide databases into three categories:

         Databases which don't support transactions at all.
         Databases in which a transaction is always active.
         Databases in which a transaction must be explicitly started (C&lt;'BEGIN WORK'&gt;).

       <b>*</b> <b>Databases</b> <b>which</b> <b>don't</b> <b>support</b> <b>transactions</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b>

       For  these databases, attempting to turn "AutoCommit" off is a fatal error.  "commit" and "rollback" both
       issue warnings about being ineffective while "AutoCommit" is in effect.

       <b>*</b> <b>Databases</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>transaction</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>active</b>

       These  are  typically  mainstream  commercial  relational  databases  with  "ANSI  standard"  transaction
       behaviour.   If  "AutoCommit"  is  off, then changes to the database won't have any lasting effect unless
       "commit" is called (but see also "disconnect"). If "rollback" is called then any changes since  the  last
       commit are undone.

       If  "AutoCommit"  is  on,  then  the effect is the same as if the DBI called "commit" automatically after
       every successful database operation. So calling "commit" or "rollback" explicitly while  "AutoCommit"  is
       on would be ineffective because the changes would have already been committed.

       Changing "AutoCommit" from off to on will trigger a "commit".

       For  databases  which  don't support a specific auto-commit mode, the driver has to commit each statement
       automatically using an explicit "COMMIT" after it completes successfully  (and  roll  it  back  using  an
       explicit  "ROLLBACK"  if it fails).  The error information reported to the application will correspond to
       the statement which was executed, unless it succeeded and the commit or rollback failed.

       <b>*</b> <b>Databases</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>transaction</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>explicitly</b> <b>started</b>

       For these databases, the intention is to have them act like databases in which a  transaction  is  always
       active (as described above).

       To  do this, the driver will automatically begin an explicit transaction when "AutoCommit" is turned off,
       or after a "commit" or "rollback" (or when the application issues the next database operation  after  one
       of those events).

       In this way, the application does not have to treat these databases as a special case.

       See "commit", "disconnect" and "Transactions" for other important notes about transactions.

       <u>"Driver"</u>

       Type: handle

       Holds  the  handle  of  the  parent  driver. The only recommended use for this is to find the name of the
       driver using:

         $dbh-&gt;{Driver}-&gt;{Name}

       <u>"Name"</u>

       Type: string

       Holds the "name" of the database. Usually (and recommended to be) the same as the  ""dbi:DriverName:...""
       string used to connect to the database, but with the leading ""dbi:DriverName:"" removed.

       <u>"Statement"</u>

       Type: string, read-only

       Returns  the  statement string passed to the most recent "prepare" or "do" method called in this database
       handle, even if that method failed. This is especially useful  where  "RaiseError"  is  enabled  and  the
       exception handler checks $@ and sees that a 'prepare' method call failed.

       <u>"RowCacheSize"</u>

       Type: integer

       A  hint  to  the  driver  indicating  the size of the local row cache that the application would like the
       driver to use for future  "SELECT"  statements.   If  a  row  cache  is  not  implemented,  then  setting
       "RowCacheSize" is ignored and getting the value returns "undef".

       Some "RowCacheSize" values have special meaning, as follows:

         0 - Automatically determine a reasonable cache size for each C&lt;SELECT&gt;
         1 - Disable the local row cache
        &gt;1 - Cache this many rows
        &lt;0 - Cache as many rows that will fit into this much memory for each C&lt;SELECT&gt;.

       Note  that  large  cache  sizes  may require a very large amount of memory (<u>cached</u> <u>rows</u> <u>*</u> <u>maximum</u> <u>size</u> <u>of</u>
       <u>row</u>). Also, a large cache will cause a longer delay not only for the first fetch, but also  whenever  the
       cache needs refilling.

       See also the "RowsInCache" statement handle attribute.

       <u>"Username"</u>

       Type: string

       Returns the username used to connect to the database.

</pre><h4><b>DBI</b> <b>STATEMENT</b> <b>HANDLE</b> <b>OBJECTS</b></h4><pre>
       This section lists the methods and attributes associated with DBI statement handles.

   <b>Statement</b> <b>Handle</b> <b>Methods</b>
       The DBI defines the following methods for use on DBI statement handles:

       <u>"bind_param"</u>

         $sth-&gt;bind_param($p_num, $bind_value)
         $sth-&gt;bind_param($p_num, $bind_value, \%attr)
         $sth-&gt;bind_param($p_num, $bind_value, $bind_type)

       The  "bind_param"  method  takes  a  copy of $bind_value and associates it (binds it) with a placeholder,
       identified by $p_num, embedded in the prepared statement. Placeholders are indicated with  question  mark
       character ("?"). For example:

         $dbh-&gt;{RaiseError} = 1;        # save having to check each method call
         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("SELECT name, age FROM people WHERE name LIKE ?");
         $sth-&gt;bind_param(1, "John%");  # placeholders are numbered from 1
         $sth-&gt;execute;
         DBI::dump_results($sth);

       See "Placeholders and Bind Values" for more information.

       <b>Data</b> <b>Types</b> <b>for</b> <b>Placeholders</b>

       The  "\%attr"  parameter can be used to hint at the data type the placeholder should have. This is rarely
       needed. Typically, the driver is only interested in knowing if the  placeholder  should  be  bound  as  a
       number or a string.

         $sth-&gt;bind_param(1, $value, { TYPE =&gt; SQL_INTEGER });

       As  a  short-cut for the common case, the data type can be passed directly, in place of the "\%attr" hash
       reference. This example is equivalent to the one above:

         $sth-&gt;bind_param(1, $value, SQL_INTEGER);

       The "TYPE" value indicates the standard (non-driver-specific) type for this  parameter.  To  specify  the
       driver-specific type, the driver may support a driver-specific attribute, such as "{ ora_type =&gt; 97 }".

       The SQL_INTEGER and other related constants can be imported using

         use DBI qw(:sql_types);

       See "DBI Constants" for more information.

       The  data type is 'sticky' in that bind values passed to <b>execute()</b> are bound with the data type specified
       by earlier <b>bind_param()</b> calls, if any.  Portable applications should not rely on being able to change the
       data type after the first "bind_param" call.

       Perl only has string and number scalar data types. All database types that aren't numbers  are  bound  as
       strings and must be in a format the database will understand except where the <b>bind_param()</b> TYPE attribute
       specifies a type that implies a particular format. For example, given:

         $sth-&gt;bind_param(1, $value, SQL_DATETIME);

       the  driver  should  expect  $value  to be in the ODBC standard SQL_DATETIME format, which is 'YYYY-MM-DD
       HH:MM:SS'. Similarly for SQL_DATE, SQL_TIME etc.

       As an alternative to specifying the data type in the "bind_param" call, you can let the driver  pass  the
       value  as  the default type ("VARCHAR").  You can then use an SQL function to convert the type within the
       statement.  For example:

         INSERT INTO price(code, price) VALUES (?, CONVERT(MONEY,?))

       The "CONVERT" function used here is just an example. The actual function and  syntax  will  vary  between
       different databases and is non-portable.

       See also "Placeholders and Bind Values" for more information.

       <u>"bind_param_inout"</u>

         $rc = $sth-&gt;bind_param_inout($p_num, \$bind_value, $max_len)  or die $sth-&gt;errstr;
         $rv = $sth-&gt;bind_param_inout($p_num, \$bind_value, $max_len, \%attr)     or ...
         $rv = $sth-&gt;bind_param_inout($p_num, \$bind_value, $max_len, $bind_type) or ...

       This method acts like "bind_param", but also enables values to be updated by the statement. The statement
       is  typically  a  call to a stored procedure. The $bind_value must be passed as a reference to the actual
       value to be used.

       Note that unlike "bind_param", the $bind_value variable is not copied when "bind_param_inout" is  called.
       Instead, the value in the variable is read at the time "execute" is called.

       The  additional  $max_len parameter specifies the minimum amount of memory to allocate to $bind_value for
       the new value. If the value returned from the database is too big to fit, then the execution should fail.
       If unsure what value to use, pick a generous length, i.e., a length larger than the  longest  value  that
       would ever be returned.  The only cost of using a larger value than needed is wasted memory.

       Undefined  values  or  "undef" are used to indicate null values.  See also "Placeholders and Bind Values"
       for more information.

       <u>"bind_param_array"</u>

         $rc = $sth-&gt;bind_param_array($p_num, $array_ref_or_value)
         $rc = $sth-&gt;bind_param_array($p_num, $array_ref_or_value, \%attr)
         $rc = $sth-&gt;bind_param_array($p_num, $array_ref_or_value, $bind_type)

       The "bind_param_array" method is used to bind an array  of  values  to  a  placeholder  embedded  in  the
       prepared statement which is to be executed with "execute_array". For example:

         $dbh-&gt;{RaiseError} = 1;        # save having to check each method call
         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("INSERT INTO staff (first_name, last_name, dept) VALUES(?, ?, ?)");
         $sth-&gt;bind_param_array(1, [ 'John', 'Mary', 'Tim' ]);
         $sth-&gt;bind_param_array(2, [ 'Booth', 'Todd', 'Robinson' ]);
         $sth-&gt;bind_param_array(3, "SALES"); # scalar will be reused for each row
         $sth-&gt;execute_array( { ArrayTupleStatus =&gt; \my @tuple_status } );

       The  %attr  ($bind_type)  argument  is  the  same as defined for "bind_param".  Refer to "bind_param" for
       general details on using placeholders.

       (Note that <b>bind_param_array()</b> can <u>not</u> be used to expand a  placeholder  into  a  list  of  values  for  a
       statement  like  "SELECT  foo  WHERE  bar  IN  (?)".  A placeholder can only ever represent one value per
       execution.)

       Scalar values, including "undef", may also be bound by "bind_param_array". In which case the  same  value
       will  be used for each "execute" call. Driver-specific implementations may behave differently, e.g., when
       binding to a stored procedure call, some databases may permit mixing scalars and arrays as arguments.

       The default implementation provided by DBI (for drivers that have not implemented array  binding)  is  to
       iteratively  call  "execute"  for each parameter tuple provided in the bound arrays.  Drivers may provide
       more optimized implementations using whatever bulk operation  support  the  database  API  provides.  The
       default  driver  behaviour  should  match  the  default  DBI  behaviour,  but  always consult your driver
       documentation as there may be driver specific issues to consider.

       Note that the default implementation currently  only  supports  non-data  returning  statements  (INSERT,
       UPDATE,  but not SELECT). Also, "bind_param_array" and "bind_param" cannot be mixed in the same statement
       execution, and "bind_param_array" must be used with "execute_array"; using "bind_param_array"  will  have
       no effect for "execute".

       The "bind_param_array" method was added in DBI 1.22.

       <u>"execute"</u>

         $rv = $sth-&gt;execute                or die $sth-&gt;errstr;
         $rv = $sth-&gt;execute(@bind_values)  or die $sth-&gt;errstr;

       Perform whatever processing is necessary to execute the prepared statement.  An "undef" is returned if an
       error occurs.  A successful "execute" always returns true regardless of the number of rows affected, even
       if  it's zero (see below). It is always important to check the return status of "execute" (and most other
       DBI methods) for errors if you're not using "RaiseError".

       For a <u>non</u>-"SELECT" statement, "execute" returns the number of rows affected, if known. If  no  rows  were
       affected,  then "execute" returns "0E0", which Perl will treat as 0 but will regard as true. Note that it
       is <u>not</u> an error for no rows to be affected by a statement. If the number of rows affected is  not  known,
       then "execute" returns -1.

       For  "SELECT"  statements,  execute  simply "starts" the query within the database engine. Use one of the
       fetch methods to retrieve the data after calling "execute".  The "execute" method  does  <u>not</u>  return  the
       number  of  rows  that  will  be returned by the query (because most databases can't tell in advance), it
       simply returns a true value.

       You can tell if the statement was a "SELECT" statement by checking if "$sth-&gt;{NUM_OF_FIELDS}" is  greater
       than zero after calling "execute".

       If  any  arguments  are  given,  then  "execute" will effectively call "bind_param" for each value before
       executing the statement.  Values bound in this way are usually treated as "SQL_VARCHAR" types unless  the
       driver can determine the correct type (which is rare), or unless "bind_param" (or "bind_param_inout") has
       already been used to specify the type.

       Note that passing "execute" an empty array is the same as passing no arguments at all, which will execute
       the statement with previously bound values.  That's probably not what you want.

       If  <b>execute()</b> is called on a statement handle that's still active ($sth-&gt;{Active} is true) then it should
       effectively call <b>finish()</b> to tidy up the previous execution results before starting this new execution.

       <u>"execute_array"</u>

         $tuples = $sth-&gt;execute_array(\%attr) or die $sth-&gt;errstr;
         $tuples = $sth-&gt;execute_array(\%attr, @bind_values) or die $sth-&gt;errstr;

         ($tuples, $rows) = $sth-&gt;execute_array(\%attr) or die $sth-&gt;errstr;
         ($tuples, $rows) = $sth-&gt;execute_array(\%attr, @bind_values) or die $sth-&gt;errstr;

       Execute the prepared statement once for each parameter tuple (group of values)  provided  either  in  the
       @bind_values, or by prior calls to "bind_param_array", or via a reference passed in \%attr.

       When  called  in  scalar  context  the  <b>execute_array()</b>  method returns the number of tuples executed, or
       "undef" if an  error  occurred.   Like  <b>execute()</b>,  a  successful  <b>execute_array()</b>  always  returns  true
       regardless  of  the  number  of  tuples  executed,  even  if  it's  zero.  If  there  were any errors the
       ArrayTupleStatus array can be used to discover which tuples failed and with what errors.

       When called in list context the <b>execute_array()</b> method returns  two  scalars;  $tuples  is  the  same  as
       calling  <b>execute_array()</b>  in  scalar  context and $rows is the number of rows affected for each tuple, if
       available or -1 if the driver cannot determine this. NOTE, some drivers cannot determine  the  number  of
       rows  affected  per tuple but can provide the number of rows affected for the batch.  If you are doing an
       update operation the returned rows affected may not be what you expect if, for instance, one or  more  of
       the tuples affected the same row multiple times.  Some drivers may not yet support list context, in which
       case  $rows will be undef, or may not be able to provide the number of rows affected when performing this
       batch operation, in which case $rows will be -1.

       Bind values for the tuples to be executed may be supplied row-wise by an "ArrayTupleFetch" attribute,  or
       else column-wise in the @bind_values argument, or else column-wise by prior calls to "bind_param_array".

       Where  column-wise  binding  is  used  (via the @bind_values argument or calls to <b>bind_param_array()</b>) the
       maximum number of elements in any one of the bound value arrays determines the number of tuples executed.
       Placeholders with fewer values in their parameter arrays are treated  as  if  padded  with  undef  (NULL)
       values.

       If  a scalar value is bound, instead of an array reference, it is treated as a <u>variable</u> length array with
       all elements having the same value. It does not influence the number of tuples executed, so if all  bound
       arrays  have  zero  elements  then zero tuples will be executed. If <u>all</u> bound values are scalars then one
       tuple will be executed, making <b>execute_array()</b> act just like <b>execute()</b>.

       The "ArrayTupleFetch" attribute can be used to specify a reference to a subroutine that will be called to
       provide the bind values for each tuple execution. The subroutine should return an reference to  an  array
       which  contains  the  appropriate  number  of bind values, or return an undef if there is no more data to
       execute.

       As a convenience, the "ArrayTupleFetch" attribute can also be used to  specify  a  statement  handle.  In
       which  case  the  <b>fetchrow_arrayref()</b>  method  will  be  called on the given statement handle in order to
       provide the bind values for each tuple execution.

       The values specified via <b>bind_param_array()</b> or the @bind_values  parameter  may  be  either  scalars,  or
       arrayrefs.   If any @bind_values are given, then "execute_array" will effectively call "bind_param_array"
       for each value before executing the  statement.   Values  bound  in  this  way  are  usually  treated  as
       "SQL_VARCHAR"  types  unless  the  driver  can  determine  the  correct  type  (which is rare), or unless
       "bind_param", "bind_param_inout", "bind_param_array", or "bind_param_inout_array" has already  been  used
       to specify the type.  See "bind_param_array" for details.

       The  "ArrayTupleStatus"  attribute  can be used to specify a reference to an array which will receive the
       execute status of each executed parameter tuple. Note  the  "ArrayTupleStatus"  attribute  was  mandatory
       until DBI 1.38.

       For  tuples which are successfully executed, the element at the same ordinal position in the status array
       is the resulting rowcount (or -1 if unknown).  If the execution of a tuple  causes  an  error,  then  the
       corresponding  status array element will be set to a reference to an array containing "err", "errstr" and
       "state" set by the failed execution.

       If <b>any</b> tuple execution returns  an  error,  "execute_array"  will  return  "undef".  In  that  case,  the
       application  should  inspect the status array to determine which parameter tuples failed.  Some databases
       may not continue executing tuples beyond the first failure. In this case the  status  array  will  either
       hold fewer elements, or the elements beyond the failure will be undef.

       If  all  parameter  tuples are successfully executed, "execute_array" returns the number tuples executed.
       If no tuples were executed, then <b>execute_array()</b> returns "0E0", just like <b>execute()</b> does, which Perl will
       treat as 0 but will regard as true.

       For example:

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("INSERT INTO staff (first_name, last_name) VALUES (?, ?)");
         my $tuples = $sth-&gt;execute_array(
             { ArrayTupleStatus =&gt; \my @tuple_status },
             \@first_names,
             \@last_names,
         );
         if ($tuples) {
             print "Successfully inserted $tuples records\n";
         }
         else {
             for my $tuple (0..@last_names-1) {
                 my $status = $tuple_status[$tuple];
                 $status = [0, "Skipped"] unless defined $status;
                 next unless ref $status;
                 printf "Failed to insert (%s, %s): %s\n",
                     $first_names[$tuple], $last_names[$tuple], $status-&gt;[1];
             }
         }

       Support for data returning statements such as  SELECT  is  driver-specific  and  subject  to  change.  At
       present, the default implementation provided by DBI only supports non-data returning statements.

       Transaction  semantics when using array binding are driver and database specific.  If "AutoCommit" is on,
       the default DBI implementation will cause each parameter tuple to be individually  committed  (or  rolled
       back  in  the  event  of an error). If "AutoCommit" is off, the application is responsible for explicitly
       committing the entire set of bound parameter tuples.  Note that different drivers and databases may  have
       different behaviours when some parameter tuples cause failures. In some cases, the driver or database may
       automatically  rollback the effect of all prior parameter tuples that succeeded in the transaction; other
       drivers or databases may retain the effect of prior successfully executed parameter tuples.  Be  sure  to
       check your driver and database for its specific behaviour.

       Note  that,  in  general,  performance  will  usually  be  better with "AutoCommit" turned off, and using
       explicit "commit" after each "execute_array" call.

       The "execute_array" method was added in DBI 1.22, and ArrayTupleFetch was added in 1.36.

       <u>"execute_for_fetch"</u>

         $tuples = $sth-&gt;execute_for_fetch($fetch_tuple_sub);
         $tuples = $sth-&gt;execute_for_fetch($fetch_tuple_sub, \@tuple_status);

         ($tuples, $rows) = $sth-&gt;execute_for_fetch($fetch_tuple_sub);
         ($tuples, $rows) = $sth-&gt;execute_for_fetch($fetch_tuple_sub, \@tuple_status);

       The <b>execute_for_fetch()</b> method is used to perform bulk operations and although it is most often used  via
       the  <b>execute_array()</b>  method  you  can  use  it  directly.  The main difference between execute_array and
       execute_for_fetch is the former does column or row-wise binding and the latter uses row-wise binding.

       The fetch subroutine, referenced by $fetch_tuple_sub, is expected to  return  a  reference  to  an  array
       (known as a 'tuple') or undef.

       The  <b>execute_for_fetch()</b>  method calls $fetch_tuple_sub, without any parameters, until it returns a false
       value. Each tuple returned is used to provide bind values for an $sth-&gt;execute(@$tuple) call.

       In scalar context <b>execute_for_fetch()</b> returns "undef" if there were any errors and the number  of  tuples
       executed otherwise. Like <b>execute()</b> and <b>execute_array()</b> a zero is returned as "0E0" so <b>execute_for_fetch()</b>
       is  only  false on error.  If there were any errors the @tuple_status array can be used to discover which
       tuples failed and with what errors.

       When called in list context <b>execute_for_fetch()</b> returns two scalars;  $tuples  is  the  same  as  calling
       <b>execute_for_fetch()</b> in scalar context and $rows is the sum of the number of rows affected for each tuple,
       if  available  or  -1  if  the  driver  cannot  determine this.  If you are doing an update operation the
       returned rows affected may not be what you expect if, for instance, one or more of  the  tuples  affected
       the  same row multiple times.  Some drivers may not yet support list context, in which case $rows will be
       undef, or may not be able to provide the number of rows affected when performing this batch operation, in
       which case $rows will be -1.

       If \@tuple_status is passed then the execute_for_fetch method uses it to return status  information.  The
       tuple_status  array  holds  one  element  per tuple. If the corresponding <b>execute()</b> did not fail then the
       element holds the return value from <b>execute()</b>, which is typically a row count. If the <b>execute()</b> did  fail
       then the element holds a reference to an array containing ($sth-&gt;err, $sth-&gt;errstr, $sth-&gt;state).

       If  the driver detects an error that it knows means no further tuples can be executed then it may return,
       with an error status, even though $fetch_tuple_sub may still have more tuples to be executed.

       Although   each    tuple    returned    by    $fetch_tuple_sub    is    effectively    used    to    call
       $sth-&gt;execute(@$tuple_array_ref)  the  exact  timing  may  vary.   Drivers are free to accumulate sets of
       tuples to pass to the database server in bulk group operations for more  efficient  execution.   However,
       the  $fetch_tuple_sub is specifically allowed to return the same array reference each time (which is what
       <b>fetchrow_arrayref()</b> usually does).

       For example:

         my $sel = $dbh1-&gt;prepare("select foo, bar from table1");
         $sel-&gt;execute;

         my $ins = $dbh2-&gt;prepare("insert into table2 (foo, bar) values (?,?)");
         my $fetch_tuple_sub = sub { $sel-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref };

         my @tuple_status;
         $rc = $ins-&gt;execute_for_fetch($fetch_tuple_sub, \@tuple_status);
         my @errors = grep { ref $_ } @tuple_status;

       Similarly, if you already have an array containing the data rows to be processed you'd use  a  subroutine
       to shift off and return each array ref in turn:

         $ins-&gt;execute_for_fetch( sub { shift @array_of_arrays }, \@tuple_status);

       The "execute_for_fetch" method was added in DBI 1.38.

       <u>"last_insert_id"</u>

         $rv = $sth-&gt;last_insert_id();
         $rv = $sth-&gt;last_insert_id($catalog, $schema, $table, $field);
         $rv = $sth-&gt;last_insert_id($catalog, $schema, $table, $field, \%attr);

       Returns a value 'identifying' the row inserted by last execution of the statement $sth, if possible.

       For  some  drivers the value may be 'identifying' the row inserted by the last executed statement, not by
       $sth.

       See database handle method last_insert_id for all details.

       The "last_insert_id" statement method was added in DBI 1.642.

       <u>"fetchrow_arrayref"</u>

         $ary_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref;
         $ary_ref = $sth-&gt;fetch;    # alias

       Fetches the next row of data and returns a reference to an array holding the field values.   Null  fields
       are returned as "undef" values in the array.  This is the fastest way to fetch data, particularly if used
       with "$sth-&gt;bind_columns".

       If  there are no more rows or if an error occurs, then "fetchrow_arrayref" returns an "undef". You should
       check "$sth-&gt;err" afterwards (or use the "RaiseError" attribute) to discover if the "undef" returned  was
       due to an error.

       Note  that the same array reference is returned for each fetch, so don't store the reference and then use
       it after a later fetch.  Also, the elements of the array are also reused for each row, so  take  care  if
       you want to take a reference to an element. See also "bind_columns".

       <u>"fetchrow_array"</u>

        @ary = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_array;

       An  alternative  to "fetchrow_arrayref". Fetches the next row of data and returns it as a list containing
       the field values.  Null fields are returned as "undef" values in the list.

       If there are no more rows or if an error occurs, then "fetchrow_array" returns an empty list. You  should
       check  "$sth-&gt;err"  afterwards (or use the "RaiseError" attribute) to discover if the empty list returned
       was due to an error.

       If called in a scalar context for a statement handle that has more  than  one  column,  it  is  undefined
       whether  the  driver will return the value of the first column or the last. So don't do that.  Also, in a
       scalar context, an "undef" is returned if there are no more rows or if an error  occurred.  That  "undef"
       can't  be  distinguished  from  an  "undef"  returned  because the first field value was NULL.  For these
       reasons you should exercise some caution if you use "fetchrow_array" in a scalar context.

       <u>"fetchrow_hashref"</u>

        $hash_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_hashref;
        $hash_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_hashref($name);

       An alternative to "fetchrow_arrayref". Fetches the next row of data and returns it as a  reference  to  a
       hash  containing  field  name  and  field value pairs.  Null fields are returned as "undef" values in the
       hash.

       If there are no more rows or if an error occurs, then "fetchrow_hashref" returns an "undef".  You  should
       check  "$sth-&gt;err" afterwards (or use the "RaiseError" attribute) to discover if the "undef" returned was
       due to an error.

       The optional $name parameter specifies the name of the statement handle attribute. For historical reasons
       it defaults to ""NAME"", however using either ""NAME_lc"" or ""NAME_uc"" is recommended for portability.

       The keys of the hash are the same names returned by "$sth-&gt;{$name}". If more than one field has the  same
       name,  there  will  only  be one entry in the returned hash for those fields, so statements like ""select
       foo, foo from bar"" will return only a single key from "fetchrow_hashref".  In  these  cases  use  column
       aliases  or  "fetchrow_arrayref".   Note  that it is the database server (and not the DBD implementation)
       which provides the <u>name</u> for fields containing functions like "count(*)"  or  "max(c_foo)"  and  they  may
       clash  with  existing  column  names (most databases don't care about duplicate column names in a result-
       set). If you want these to return as unique names that are the same across databases, use <u>aliases</u>, as  in
       ""select  count(*)  as  cnt""  or ""select max(c_foo) mx_foo, ..."" depending on the syntax your database
       supports.

       Because of the extra work "fetchrow_hashref" and Perl  have  to  perform,  it  is  not  as  efficient  as
       "fetchrow_arrayref" or "fetchrow_array".

       By default a reference to a new hash is returned for each row.  It is likely that a future version of the
       DBI will support an attribute which will enable the same hash to be reused for each row. This will give a
       significant  performance  boost,  but  it won't be enabled by default because of the risk of breaking old
       code.

       <u>"fetchall_arrayref"</u>

         $tbl_ary_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchall_arrayref;
         $tbl_ary_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchall_arrayref( $slice );
         $tbl_ary_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchall_arrayref( $slice, $max_rows  );

       The "fetchall_arrayref" method can be used to fetch all the data to  be  returned  from  a  prepared  and
       executed statement handle. It returns a reference to an array that contains one reference per row.

       If called on an <u>inactive</u> statement handle, "fetchall_arrayref" returns undef.

       If  there  are  no  rows  left  to  return from an <u>active</u> statement handle, "fetchall_arrayref" returns a
       reference to an empty array. If an error occurs, "fetchall_arrayref" returns the data fetched  thus  far,
       which  may  be  none.   You  should  check  "$sth-&gt;err" afterwards (or use the "RaiseError" attribute) to
       discover if the data is complete or was truncated due to an error.

       If $slice is an array reference, "fetchall_arrayref" uses "fetchrow_arrayref" to fetch  each  row  as  an
       array  ref.  If  the $slice array is not empty then it is used as a slice to select individual columns by
       perl array index number (starting at 0, unlike column and parameter numbers which start at 1).

       With no parameters, or if $slice is undefined, "fetchall_arrayref" acts as if passed an empty array ref.

       For example, to fetch just the first column of every row:

         $tbl_ary_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchall_arrayref([0]);

       To fetch the second to last and last column of every row:

         $tbl_ary_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchall_arrayref([-2,-1]);

       Those two examples both return a reference to an array of array refs.

       If $slice is a hash reference, "fetchall_arrayref" fetches each row as a hash reference.  If  the  $slice
       hash  is  empty  then  the  keys in the hashes have whatever name lettercase is returned by default. (See
       "FetchHashKeyName" attribute.) If the $slice hash is <u>not</u> empty, then it is used  as  a  slice  to  select
       individual  columns  by  name.  The values of the hash should be set to 1.  The key names of the returned
       hashes match the letter case of the names in the parameter hash,  regardless  of  the  "FetchHashKeyName"
       attribute.

       For example, to fetch all fields of every row as a hash ref:

         $tbl_ary_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchall_arrayref({});

       To  fetch  only  the  fields called "foo" and "bar" of every row as a hash ref (with keys named "foo" and
       "BAR", regardless of the original capitalization):

         $tbl_ary_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchall_arrayref({ foo=&gt;1, BAR=&gt;1 });

       Those two examples both return a reference to an array of hash refs.

       If $slice is a <u>reference</u> <u>to</u> <u>a</u> <u>hash</u> <u>reference</u>, that hash is used to select and rename  columns.  The  keys
       are 0-based column index numbers and the values are the corresponding keys for the returned row hashes.

       For  example,  to fetch only the first and second columns of every row as a hash ref (with keys named "k"
       and "v" regardless of their original names):

         $tbl_ary_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchall_arrayref( \{ 0 =&gt; 'k', 1 =&gt; 'v' } );

       If $max_rows is defined and greater than or equal to zero then it is used to limit  the  number  of  rows
       fetched  before  returning.   <b>fetchall_arrayref()</b>  can  then be called again to fetch more rows.  This is
       especially useful when you need the better performance  of  <b>fetchall_arrayref()</b>  but  don't  have  enough
       memory to fetch and return all the rows in one go.

       Here's an example (assumes RaiseError is enabled):

         my $rows = []; # cache for batches of rows
         while( my $row = ( shift(@$rows) || # get row from cache, or reload cache:
                            shift(@{$rows=$sth-&gt;fetchall_arrayref(undef,10_000)||[]}) )
         ) {
           ...
         }

       That  <u>might</u>  be  the  fastest  way to fetch and process lots of rows using the DBI, but it depends on the
       relative cost of method calls vs memory allocation.

       A standard "while" loop with column binding is often faster because the cost of allocating memory for the
       batch of rows is greater than the saving by reducing method calls. It's possible that the DBI may provide
       a way to reuse the memory of a previous batch in future, which would then shift the balance back  towards
       <b>fetchall_arrayref()</b>.

       <u>"fetchall_hashref"</u>

         $hash_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchall_hashref($key_field);

       The  "fetchall_hashref"  method  can  be  used  to  fetch all the data to be returned from a prepared and
       executed statement handle. It returns a reference to a hash containing a key for each distinct  value  of
       the  $key_field  column  that  was fetched. For each key the corresponding value is a reference to a hash
       containing all the selected columns and their values, as returned by fetchrow_hashref().

       If there are no rows to return, "fetchall_hashref" returns a reference to an  empty  hash.  If  an  error
       occurs,  "fetchall_hashref"  returns  the  data  fetched  thus  far, which may be none.  You should check
       "$sth-&gt;err" afterwards (or use the "RaiseError" attribute) to discover if the data  is  complete  or  was
       truncated due to an error.

       The  $key_field  parameter provides the name of the field that holds the value to be used for the key for
       the returned hash.  For example:

         $dbh-&gt;{FetchHashKeyName} = 'NAME_lc';
         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("SELECT FOO, BAR, ID, NAME, BAZ FROM TABLE");
         $sth-&gt;execute;
         $hash_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchall_hashref('id');
         print "Name for id 42 is $hash_ref-&gt;{42}-&gt;{name}\n";

       The $key_field parameter can also be specified as  an  integer  column  number  (counting  from  1).   If
       $key_field  doesn't match any column in the statement, as a name first then as a number, then an error is
       returned.

       For queries returning more than one 'key' column, you  can  specify  multiple  column  names  by  passing
       $key_field  as  a  reference to an array containing one or more key column names (or index numbers).  For
       example:

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("SELECT foo, bar, baz FROM table");
         $sth-&gt;execute;
         $hash_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchall_hashref( [ qw(foo bar) ] );
         print "For foo 42 and bar 38, baz is $hash_ref-&gt;{42}-&gt;{38}-&gt;{baz}\n";

       The <b>fetchall_hashref()</b> method is normally used only where the key fields values for each row are  unique.
       If  multiple  rows are returned with the same values for the key fields then later rows overwrite earlier
       ones.

       <u>"more_results"</u>

       ... not yet documented ...

       <u>"finish"</u>

         $rc  = $sth-&gt;finish;

       Indicate that no more data will be fetched from this statement handle before it is either executed  again
       or destroyed.  You almost certainly do <u>not</u> need to call this method.

       Adding  calls  to "finish" after loop that fetches all rows is a common mistake, don't do it, it can mask
       genuine problems like uncaught fetch errors.

       When all the data has been fetched from a "SELECT" statement, the driver will automatically call "finish"
       for you. So you should <u>not</u> call it explicitly <u>except</u> when you know that you've not fetched all  the  data
       from a statement handle <u>and</u> the handle won't be destroyed soon.

       The  most  common example is when you only want to fetch just one row, but in that case the "selectrow_*"
       methods are usually better anyway.

       Consider a query like:

         SELECT foo FROM table WHERE bar=? ORDER BY baz

       on a very large table. When executed, the database server will have to  use  temporary  buffer  space  to
       store  the sorted rows. If, after executing the handle and selecting just a few rows, the handle won't be
       re-executed for some time and won't be destroyed, the "finish" method can be used to tell the server that
       the buffer space can be freed.

       Calling "finish" resets the "Active" attribute for the statement.  It may also make some statement handle
       attributes (such as "NAME" and "TYPE") unavailable if they have  not  already  been  accessed  (and  thus
       cached).

       The "finish" method does not affect the transaction status of the database connection.  It has nothing to
       do  with  transactions.  It's  mostly  an internal "housekeeping" method that is rarely needed.  See also
       "disconnect" and the "Active" attribute.

       The "finish" method should have been called "discard_pending_rows".

       <u>"rows"</u>

         $rv = $sth-&gt;rows;

       Returns the number of rows affected by the last row affecting command, or -1 if the number of rows is not
       known or not available.

       Generally, you can only rely on a row count after a <u>non</u>-"SELECT" "execute" (for some specific  operations
       like "UPDATE" and "DELETE"), or after fetching all the rows of a "SELECT" statement.

       For  "SELECT"  statements,  it is generally not possible to know how many rows will be returned except by
       fetching them all.  Some drivers will return the number of rows the application has fetched so  far,  but
       others  may  return  -1 until all rows have been fetched.  So use of the "rows" method or $DBI::rows with
       "SELECT" statements is not recommended.

       One alternative method to get a row count for a "SELECT" is to execute a "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM  ..."  SQL
       statement with the same "..." as your query and then fetch the row count from that.

       <u>"bind_col"</u>

         $rc = $sth-&gt;bind_col($column_number, \$var_to_bind);
         $rc = $sth-&gt;bind_col($column_number, \$var_to_bind, \%attr );
         $rc = $sth-&gt;bind_col($column_number, \$var_to_bind, $bind_type );

       Binds a Perl variable and/or some attributes to an output column (field) of a "SELECT" statement.  Column
       numbers  count  up  from  1.  You do not need to bind output columns in order to fetch data.  For maximum
       portability between drivers, <b>bind_col()</b> should be called  after  <b>execute()</b>  and  not  before.   See  also
       "bind_columns" for an example.

       The binding is performed at a low level using Perl aliasing.  Whenever a row is fetched from the database
       $var_to_bind appears to be automatically updated simply because it now refers to the same memory location
       as  the  corresponding  column  value.   This makes using bound variables very efficient.  Binding a tied
       variable doesn't work, currently.

       The "bind_param" method performs a similar, but opposite, function for input variables.

       <b>Data</b> <b>Types</b> <b>for</b> <b>Column</b> <b>Binding</b>

       The "\%attr" parameter can be used to hint at the data  type  formatting  the  column  should  have.  For
       example, you can use:

         $sth-&gt;bind_col(1, undef, { TYPE =&gt; SQL_DATETIME });

       to  specify that you'd like the column (which presumably is some kind of datetime type) to be returned in
       the standard format for SQL_DATETIME, which is 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS', rather than the  native  formatting
       the database would normally use.

       There's  no  $var_to_bind  in that example to emphasize the point that <b>bind_col()</b> works on the underlying
       column and not just a particular bound variable.

       As a short-cut for the common case, the data type can be passed directly, in place of the  "\%attr"  hash
       reference. This example is equivalent to the one above:

         $sth-&gt;bind_col(1, undef, SQL_DATETIME);

       The  "TYPE"  value  indicates  the standard (non-driver-specific) type for this parameter. To specify the
       driver-specific type, the driver may support a driver-specific attribute, such as "{ ora_type =&gt; 97 }".

       The SQL_DATETIME and other related constants can be imported using

         use DBI qw(:sql_types);

       See "DBI Constants" for more information.

       Few drivers support specifying a data type via a "bind_col" call (most will simply ignore the data type).
       Fewer still allow the data type to be altered once set. If you do set  a  column  type  the  type  should
       remain  sticky  through further calls to bind_col for the same column if the type is not overridden (this
       is important for instance when you are using a slice in fetchall_arrayref).

       The TYPE attribute for <b>bind_col()</b> was first specified in DBI 1.41.

       From DBI 1.611, drivers can use the "TYPE" attribute to attempt to cast the bound scalar to a  perl  type
       which more closely matches "TYPE". At present DBI supports "SQL_INTEGER", "SQL_DOUBLE" and "SQL_NUMERIC".
       See "sql_type_cast" for details of how types are cast.

       <b>Other</b> <b>attributes</b> <b>for</b> <b>Column</b> <b>Binding</b>

       The "\%attr" parameter may also contain the following attributes:

       "StrictlyTyped"
           If  a  "TYPE"  attribute is passed to bind_col, then the driver will attempt to change the bound perl
           scalar to match the type more closely. If the bound value cannot be cast to the requested "TYPE" then
           by default it is left untouched and no error is generated. If you specify "StrictlyTyped"  as  1  and
           the cast fails, this will generate an error.

           This  attribute  was first added in DBI 1.611. When 1.611 was released few drivers actually supported
           this attribute but DBD::Oracle and DBD::ODBC should from versions 1.24.

       "DiscardString"
           When the "TYPE" attribute is passed to "bind_col" and the driver successfully casts  the  bound  perl
           scalar  to  a  non-string  type then if "DiscardString" is set to 1, the string portion of the scalar
           will be discarded. By default, "DiscardString" is not set.

           This attribute was first added in DBI 1.611. When 1.611 was released few drivers  actually  supported
           this attribute but DBD::Oracle and DBD::ODBC should from versions 1.24.

       <u>"bind_columns"</u>

         $rc = $sth-&gt;bind_columns(@list_of_refs_to_vars_to_bind);

       Calls "bind_col" for each column of the "SELECT" statement.

       The  list  of references should have the same number of elements as the number of columns in the "SELECT"
       statement. If it doesn't then "bind_columns" will bind the elements given, up to the number  of  columns,
       and then return an error.

       For maximum portability between drivers, <b>bind_columns()</b> should be called after <b>execute()</b> and not before.

       For example:

         $dbh-&gt;{RaiseError} = 1; # do this, or check every call for errors
         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(q{ SELECT region, sales FROM sales_by_region });
         $sth-&gt;execute;
         my ($region, $sales);

         # Bind Perl variables to columns:
         $rv = $sth-&gt;bind_columns(\$region, \$sales);

         # you can also use Perl's \(...) syntax (see perlref docs):
         #     $sth-&gt;bind_columns(\($region, $sales));

         # Column binding is the most efficient way to fetch data
         while ($sth-&gt;fetch) {
             print "$region: $sales\n";
         }

       For  compatibility  with  old  scripts,  the  first  parameter will be ignored if it is "undef" or a hash
       reference.

       Here's a more fancy example that binds columns to the values <u>inside</u> a hash (thanks to H.Merijn Brand):

         $sth-&gt;execute;
         my %row;
         $sth-&gt;bind_columns (\( @row{ @{$sth-&gt;{NAME_lc} }} ));
         while ($sth-&gt;fetch) {
             print "$row{region}: $row{sales}\n";
         }

       but has a small drawback: If data already fetched call to "bind_columns" will flush current  values.   If
       you want to bind_columns after you have fetched you can use:

         use feature "refaliasing";
         no warnings "experimental::refaliasing";
         while (my $row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref) {
             \(@$data{ $sth-&gt;{NAME_lc}-&gt;@* }) =  \(@$row);
         }

       or, with older perl versions:

         use Data::Alias;
         alias @$data{ $sth-&gt;{NAME_lc}-&gt;@* } =  @$row;

       This  is  useful  in situations when you have many left joins, but wanna to join your %$data hash to only
       subset of fetched values.

       <u>"dump_results"</u>

         $rows = $sth-&gt;dump_results($maxlen, $lsep, $fsep, $fh);

       Fetches all the rows from $sth, calls "DBI::neat_list" for each  row,  and  prints  the  results  to  $fh
       (defaults  to "STDOUT") separated by $lsep (default "\n"). $fsep defaults to ", " and $maxlen defaults to
       35.

       This method is designed as a handy utility for prototyping and testing queries. Since it uses "neat_list"
       to format and edit  the  string  for  reading  by  humans,  it  is  not  recommended  for  data  transfer
       applications.

   <b>Statement</b> <b>Handle</b> <b>Attributes</b>
       This section describes attributes specific to statement handles. Most of these attributes are read-only.

       Changes  to  these  statement  handle  attributes  do  not  affect any other existing or future statement
       handles.

       Attempting to set or get the value of an unknown attribute generates a warning, except for private driver
       specific attributes (which all have names starting with a lowercase letter).

       Example:

         ... = $h-&gt;{NUM_OF_FIELDS};    # get/read

       Some drivers cannot provide valid values for some or all of these attributes until after  "$sth-&gt;execute"
       has been successfully called. Typically the attribute will be "undef" in these situations.

       Some  attributes,  like  NAME, are not appropriate to some types of statement, like SELECT. Typically the
       attribute will be "undef" in these situations.

       For drivers which  support  stored  procedures  and  multiple  result  sets  (see  "more_results")  these
       attributes relate to the <u>current</u> result set.

       See also "finish" to learn more about the effect it may have on some attributes.

       <u>"NUM_OF_FIELDS"</u>

       Type: integer, read-only

       Number  of  fields (columns) in the data the prepared statement may return.  Statements that don't return
       rows of data, like "DELETE" and "CREATE" set "NUM_OF_FIELDS" to  0  (though  it  may  be  undef  in  some
       drivers).

       <u>"NUM_OF_PARAMS"</u>

       Type: integer, read-only

       The  number of parameters (placeholders) in the prepared statement.  See SUBSTITUTION VARIABLES below for
       more details.

       <u>"NAME"</u>

       Type: array-ref, read-only

       Returns a reference to an array of field names for each column. The names may contain spaces  but  should
       not  be  truncated  or have any trailing space. Note that the names have the letter case (upper, lower or
       mixed) as returned by the driver being used. Portable applications should use "NAME_lc" or "NAME_uc".

         print "First column name: $sth-&gt;{NAME}-&gt;[0]\n";

       Also note that the name returned for (aggregate) functions like count(*) or max(c_foo) is  determined  by
       the database server and not by "DBI" or the "DBD" backend.

       <u>"NAME_lc"</u>

       Type: array-ref, read-only

       Like "/NAME" but always returns lowercase names.

       <u>"NAME_uc"</u>

       Type: array-ref, read-only

       Like "/NAME" but always returns uppercase names.

       <u>"NAME_hash"</u>

       Type: hash-ref, read-only

       <u>"NAME_lc_hash"</u>

       Type: hash-ref, read-only

       <u>"NAME_uc_hash"</u>

       Type: hash-ref, read-only

       The  "NAME_hash",  "NAME_lc_hash",  and  "NAME_uc_hash"  attributes  return  column name information as a
       reference to a hash.

       The keys of the hash are the names of the columns.  The letter case of the keys corresponds to the letter
       case returned by the "NAME", "NAME_lc", and "NAME_uc" attributes respectively (as described above).

       The value of each hash entry is the perl index number of the corresponding column (counting from 0).  For
       example:

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("select Id, Name from table");
         $sth-&gt;execute;
         @row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_array;
         print "Name $row[ $sth-&gt;{NAME_lc_hash}{name} ]\n";

       <u>"TYPE"</u>

       Type: array-ref, read-only

       Returns  a  reference to an array of integer values for each column. The value indicates the data type of
       the corresponding column.

       The values correspond to the international standards (ANSI X3.135 and ISO/IEC  9075)  which,  in  general
       terms,  means ODBC. Driver-specific types that don't exactly match standard types should generally return
       the same values as an ODBC driver supplied by the makers of the database. That might include private type
       numbers in ranges the vendor has officially registered with the ISO working group:

         <a href="ftp://sqlstandards.org/SC32/SQL_Registry/">ftp://sqlstandards.org/SC32/SQL_Registry/</a>

       Where there's no vendor-supplied ODBC driver to be compatible with, the DBI driver can use  type  numbers
       in the range that is now officially reserved for use by the DBI: -9999 to -9000.

       All possible values for "TYPE" should have at least one entry in the output of the "type_info_all" method
       (see "type_info_all").

       <u>"PRECISION"</u>

       Type: array-ref, read-only

       Returns a reference to an array of integer values for each column.

       For  numeric  columns, the value is the maximum number of digits (without considering a sign character or
       decimal point). Note that the "display size" for floating point types (REAL, FLOAT, DOUBLE) can be up  to
       7  characters  greater  than the precision (for the sign + decimal point + the letter E + a sign + 2 or 3
       digits).

       For any character type column the value is the OCTET_LENGTH, in other words  the  number  of  bytes,  not
       characters.

       (More  recent  standards  refer  to  this  as  COLUMN_SIZE  but  we  stick  with  PRECISION for backwards
       compatibility.)

       <u>"SCALE"</u>

       Type: array-ref, read-only

       Returns a reference to an array of integer values  for  each  column.   NULL  ("undef")  values  indicate
       columns where scale is not applicable.

       <u>"NULLABLE"</u>

       Type: array-ref, read-only

       Returns  a  reference  to  an array indicating the possibility of each column returning a null.  Possible
       values are 0 (or an empty string) = no, 1 = yes, 2 = unknown.

         print "First column may return NULL\n" if $sth-&gt;{NULLABLE}-&gt;[0];

       <u>"CursorName"</u>

       Type: string, read-only

       Returns the name of the cursor associated with the statement handle, if available. If not available or if
       the database driver does not support the "where current of ..." SQL syntax, then it returns "undef".

       <u>"Database"</u>

       Type: dbh, read-only

       Returns the parent $dbh of the statement handle.

       <u>"Statement"</u>

       Type: string, read-only

       Returns the statement string passed to the "prepare" method.

       <u>"ParamValues"</u>

       Type: hash ref, read-only

       Returns a reference to a hash containing the values currently bound to placeholders.   The  keys  of  the
       hash  are  the  'names'  of  the  placeholders,  typically  integers starting at 1.  Returns undef if not
       supported by the driver.

       See "ShowErrorStatement" for an example of how this is used.

       * Keys:

       If the driver supports "ParamValues" but no values have been bound yet then the driver  should  return  a
       hash  with  placeholders names in the keys but all the values undef, but some drivers may return a ref to
       an empty hash because they can't pre-determine the names.

       It is possible that the keys in the hash returned by "ParamValues" are not  exactly  the  same  as  those
       implied  by  the prepared statement.  For example, DBD::Oracle translates '"?"' placeholders into '":pN"'
       where N is a sequence number starting at 1.

       * Values:

       It is possible that the values in the hash returned by "ParamValues" are not <u>exactly</u> the  same  as  those
       passed  to  <b>bind_param()</b> or <b>execute()</b>.  The driver may have slightly modified values in some way based on
       the TYPE the value was bound with. For example a floating point value bound as an SQL_INTEGER type may be
       returned as an integer.  The values returned by "ParamValues"  can  be  passed  to  another  <b>bind_param()</b>
       method  with  the  same  TYPE  and  will be seen by the database as the same value. See also "ParamTypes"
       below.

       The "ParamValues" attribute was added in DBI 1.28.

       <u>"ParamTypes"</u>

       Type: hash ref, read-only

       Returns a reference to a hash containing the type information currently bound to  placeholders.   Returns
       undef if not supported by the driver.

       * Keys:

       See "ParamValues" above.

       * Values:

       The  hash  values  are  hashrefs  of  type  information  in  the  same form as that passed to the various
       <b>bind_param()</b> methods (See "bind_param" for the format and values).

       It is possible that the values in the hash returned by "ParamTypes" are not exactly  the  same  as  those
       passed to <b>bind_param()</b> or <b>execute()</b>.  Param attributes specified using the abbreviated form, like this:

           $sth-&gt;bind_param(1, SQL_INTEGER);

       are returned in the expanded form, as if called like this:

           $sth-&gt;bind_param(1, { TYPE =&gt; SQL_INTEGER });

       The  driver  may  have  modified  the type information in some way based on the bound values, other hints
       provided by the <b>prepare()</b>'d SQL statement, or alternate type mappings required by the  driver  or  target
       database  system.  The  driver  may also add private keys (with names beginning with the drivers reserved
       prefix, e.g., odbc_xxx).

       * Example:

       The keys and values in the returned hash can be passed to the various <b>bind_param()</b> methods to effectively
       reproduce a previous param binding.  For example:

         # assuming $sth1 is a previously prepared statement handle
         my $sth2 = $dbh-&gt;prepare( $sth1-&gt;{Statement} );
         my $ParamValues = $sth1-&gt;{ParamValues} || {};
         my $ParamTypes  = $sth1-&gt;{ParamTypes}  || {};
         $sth2-&gt;bind_param($_, $ParamValues-&gt;{$_}, $ParamTypes-&gt;{$_})
           for keys %{ {%$ParamValues, %$ParamTypes} };
         $sth2-&gt;execute();

       The "ParamTypes" attribute was added in DBI 1.49. Implementation  is  the  responsibility  of  individual
       drivers; the DBI layer default implementation simply returns undef.

       <u>"ParamArrays"</u>

       Type: hash ref, read-only

       Returns  a reference to a hash containing the values currently bound to placeholders with "execute_array"
       or "bind_param_array".  The keys of the hash are the 'names'  of  the  placeholders,  typically  integers
       starting at 1.  Returns undef if not supported by the driver or no arrays of parameters are bound.

       Each key value is an array reference containing a list of the bound parameters for that column.

       For example:

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("INSERT INTO staff (id, name) values (?,?)");
         $sth-&gt;execute_array({},[1,2], ['fred','dave']);
         if ($sth-&gt;{ParamArrays}) {
             foreach $param (keys %{$sth-&gt;{ParamArrays}}) {
                 printf "Parameters for %s : %s\n", $param,
                 join(",", @{$sth-&gt;{ParamArrays}-&gt;{$param}});
             }
         }

       It  is  possible  that the values in the hash returned by "ParamArrays" are not <u>exactly</u> the same as those
       passed to "bind_param_array" or "execute_array".  The driver may have slightly modified  values  in  some
       way  based  on  the  TYPE  the  value  was  bound  with.  For  example a floating point value bound as an
       SQL_INTEGER type may be returned as an integer.

       It is also possible that the keys in the hash returned by "ParamArrays" are not exactly the same as those
       implied by the prepared statement.  For example, DBD::Oracle translates '"?"'  placeholders into  '":pN"'
       where N is a sequence number starting at 1.

       <u>"RowsInCache"</u>

       Type: integer, read-only

       If the driver supports a local row cache for "SELECT" statements, then this attribute holds the number of
       un-fetched rows in the cache. If the driver doesn't, then it returns "undef". Note that some drivers pre-
       fetch rows on execute, whereas others wait till the first fetch.

       See also the "RowCacheSize" database handle attribute.

</pre><h4><b>FURTHER</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Catalog</b> <b>Methods</b>
       An  application  can  retrieve  metadata  information from the DBMS by issuing appropriate queries on the
       views of the Information Schema. Unfortunately, "INFORMATION_SCHEMA" views are seldom  supported  by  the
       DBMS.   Special  methods  (catalog methods) are available to return result sets for a small but important
       portion of that metadata:

         column_info
         foreign_key_info
         primary_key_info
         table_info
         statistics_info

       All catalog methods accept arguments in order to  restrict  the  result  sets.   Passing  "undef"  to  an
       optional  argument  does  not  constrain  the search for that argument.  However, an empty string ('') is
       treated as a regular search criteria and will only match an empty value.

       <b>Note</b>: SQL/CLI and ODBC differ in the handling of empty strings. An empty string  will  not  restrict  the
       result set in SQL/CLI.

       Most   arguments   in   the  catalog  methods  accept  only  <u>ordinary</u>  <u>values</u>,  e.g.   the  arguments  of
       primary_key_info().  Such arguments are treated as a literal string, i.e. the  case  is  significant  and
       quote characters are taken literally.

       Some  arguments  in  the catalog methods accept <u>search</u> <u>patterns</u> (strings containing '_' and/or '%'), e.g.
       the $table argument of column_info().  Passing '%' is equivalent to leaving the argument "undef".

       <b>Caveat</b>: The underscore ('_') is valid and often used in SQL identifiers.   Passing  such  a  value  to  a
       search  pattern  argument may return more rows than expected!  To include pattern characters as literals,
       they must be preceded by an escape character which can be achieved with

         $esc = $dbh-&gt;get_info( 14 );  # SQL_SEARCH_PATTERN_ESCAPE
         $search_pattern =~ s/([_%])/$esc$1/g;

       The ODBC and SQL/CLI specifications define a way to change the default  behaviour  described  above:  All
       arguments (except <u>list</u> <u>value</u> <u>arguments</u>) are treated as <u>identifier</u> if the "SQL_ATTR_METADATA_ID" attribute
       is  set  to  "SQL_TRUE".   <u>Quoted</u>  <u>identifiers</u>  are very similar to <u>ordinary</u> <u>values</u>, i.e. their body (the
       string within the quotes) is interpreted literally.  <u>Unquoted</u> <u>identifiers</u> are compared in UPPERCASE.

       The DBI (currently) does not support the "SQL_ATTR_METADATA_ID" attribute, i.e. it behaves like  an  ODBC
       driver where "SQL_ATTR_METADATA_ID" is set to "SQL_FALSE".

   <b>Transactions</b>
       Transactions  are  a  fundamental  part  of  any  robust database system. They protect against errors and
       database corruption by ensuring that sets of related  changes  to  the  database  take  place  in  atomic
       (indivisible, all-or-nothing) units.

       This  section  applies  to  databases  that  support  transactions  and  where  "AutoCommit" is off.  See
       "AutoCommit" for details of using "AutoCommit" with various types of databases.

       The recommended way to implement robust transactions in Perl applications is to enable  "RaiseError"  and
       catch the error that's 'thrown' as an exception.  For example, using Try::Tiny:

         use Try::Tiny;
         $dbh-&gt;{AutoCommit} = 0;  # enable transactions, if possible
         $dbh-&gt;{RaiseError} = 1;
         try {
             foo(...)        # do lots of work here
             bar(...)        # including inserts
             baz(...)        # and updates
             $dbh-&gt;commit;   # commit the changes if we get this far
         } catch {
             warn "Transaction aborted because $_"; # Try::Tiny copies $@ into $_
             # now rollback to undo the incomplete changes
             # but do it in an eval{} as it may also fail
             eval { $dbh-&gt;rollback };
             # add other application on-error-clean-up code here
         };

       If  the  "RaiseError"  attribute is not set, then DBI calls would need to be manually checked for errors,
       typically like this:

         $h-&gt;method(@args) or die $h-&gt;errstr;

       With "RaiseError" set, the DBI will automatically "die" if any DBI method call on that handle (or a child
       handle) fails, so you don't have to test the return value of each method call. See "RaiseError" for  more
       details.

       A major advantage of the "eval" approach is that the transaction will be properly rolled back if <u>any</u> code
       (not  just  DBI  calls)  in  the  inner application dies for any reason. The major advantage of using the
       "$h-&gt;{RaiseError}" attribute is that all DBI calls will be checked  automatically.  Both  techniques  are
       strongly recommended.

       After  calling  "commit"  or  "rollback"  many  drivers  will  not let you fetch from a previously active
       "SELECT" statement handle that's a child of the same database handle. A typical  way  round  this  is  to
       connect the the database twice and use one connection for "SELECT" statements.

       See "AutoCommit" and "disconnect" for other important information about transactions.

   <b>Handling</b> <b>BLOB</b> <b>/</b> <b>LONG</b> <b>/</b> <b>Memo</b> <b>Fields</b>
       Many  databases support "blob" (binary large objects), "long", or similar datatypes for holding very long
       strings or large amounts of binary data in a single field. Some databases support  variable  length  long
       values over 2,000,000,000 bytes in length.

       Since  values  of  that size can't usually be held in memory, and because databases can't usually know in
       advance the length of the longest long that will be returned from a "SELECT" statement (unlike other data
       types), some special handling is required.

       In this situation, the value of the "$h-&gt;{LongReadLen}" attribute is used to determine  how  much  buffer
       space  to allocate when fetching such fields.  The "$h-&gt;{LongTruncOk}" attribute is used to determine how
       to behave if a fetched value can't fit into the buffer.

       See the description of "LongReadLen" for more information.

       When trying to insert long or binary values, placeholders should be used since there are often limits  on
       the  maximum  size of an "INSERT" statement and the "quote" method generally can't cope with binary data.
       See "Placeholders and Bind Values".

   <b>Simple</b> <b>Examples</b>
       Here's a complete example program to select and fetch some data:

         my $data_source = "dbi::DriverName:db_name";
         my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect($data_source, $user, $password)
             or die "Can't connect to $data_source: $DBI::errstr";

         my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare( q{
                 SELECT name, phone
                 FROM mytelbook
         }) or die "Can't prepare statement: $DBI::errstr";

         my $rc = $sth-&gt;execute
             or die "Can't execute statement: $DBI::errstr";

         print "Query will return $sth-&gt;{NUM_OF_FIELDS} fields.\n\n";
         print "Field names: @{ $sth-&gt;{NAME} }\n";

         while (($name, $phone) = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_array) {
             print "$name: $phone\n";
         }
         # check for problems which may have terminated the fetch early
         die $sth-&gt;errstr if $sth-&gt;err;

         $dbh-&gt;disconnect;

       Here's a complete example program to insert some data from a file.  (This example  uses  "RaiseError"  to
       avoid needing to check each call).

         my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:DriverName:db_name", $user, $password, {
             RaiseError =&gt; 1, AutoCommit =&gt; 0
         });

         my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare( q{
             INSERT INTO table (name, phone) VALUES (?, ?)
         });

         open FH, "&lt;phone.csv" or die "Unable to open phone.csv: $!";
         while (&lt;FH&gt;) {
             chomp;
             my ($name, $phone) = split /,/;
             $sth-&gt;execute($name, $phone);
         }
         close FH;

         $dbh-&gt;commit;
         $dbh-&gt;disconnect;

       Here's how to convert fetched NULLs (undefined values) into empty strings:

         while($row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref) {
           # this is a fast and simple way to deal with nulls:
           foreach (@$row) { $_ = '' unless defined }
           print "@$row\n";
         }

       The "q{...}" style quoting used in these examples avoids clashing with quotes that may be used in the SQL
       statement.  Use  the  double-quote  like "qq{...}" operator if you want to interpolate variables into the
       string.  See "Quote and Quote-like Operators" in perlop for more details.

   <b>Threads</b> <b>and</b> <b>Thread</b> <b>Safety</b>
       Perl 5.7 and later support a new threading model called iThreads.  (The old "5.005 style" threads are not
       supported by the DBI.)

       In the iThreads model each thread has its own copy of the perl interpreter.  When a new thread is created
       the original perl interpreter is 'cloned' to create a new copy for the new thread.

       If the DBI and drivers are loaded and handles created before the thread is created then  it  will  get  a
       cloned copy of the DBI, the drivers and the handles.

       However,  the  internal pointer data within the handles will refer to the DBI and drivers in the original
       interpreter. Using those handles in the new interpreter thread is not safe, so the DBI detects  this  and
       croaks on any method call using handles that don't belong to the current thread (except for DESTROY).

       Because  of  this (possibly temporary) restriction, newly created threads must make their own connections
       to the database. Handles can't be shared across threads.

       But BEWARE, some underlying database APIs (the code the DBD driver uses to talk to  the  database,  often
       supplied  by  the  database vendor) are not thread safe. If it's not thread safe, then allowing more than
       one thread to enter the code at the same time may cause subtle/serious problems. In some  cases  allowing
       more  than  one thread to enter the code, even if <u>not</u> at the same time, can cause problems. You have been
       warned.

       Using DBI with perl threads is not yet recommended for production environments. For more information  see
       &lt;<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl">http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl</a>?node_id=288022&gt;

       Note:  There is a bug in perl 5.8.2 when configured with threads and debugging enabled (bug #24463) which
       would cause some DBI tests to fail.  These tests have been disabled for perl-5.8.2 and below.

       Tests for inner method cache are disabled for perl-5.10.x

   <b>Signal</b> <b>Handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>Canceling</b> <b>Operations</b>
       [The following only applies to systems with unix-like signal handling.  I'd welcome additions  for  other
       systems, especially Windows.]

       The  first  thing  to  say  is  that signal handling in Perl versions less than 5.8 is <u>not</u> safe. There is
       always a small risk of Perl crashing and/or core dumping when, or after, handling a  signal  because  the
       signal  could  arrive  and  be  handled  while  internal data structures are being changed. If the signal
       handling code used those same internal data structures it could cause all manner of  subtle  and  not-so-
       subtle problems.  The risk was reduced with 5.4.4 but was still present in all perls up through 5.8.0.

       Beginning  in  perl 5.8.0 perl implements 'safe' signal handling if your system has the POSIX <b>sigaction()</b>
       routine. Now when a signal is delivered perl just makes a note of it but does <u>not</u> run the  %SIG  handler.
       The handling is 'deferred' until a 'safe' moment.

       Although this change made signal handling safe, it also lead to a problem with signals being deferred for
       longer than you'd like.  If a signal arrived while executing a system call, such as waiting for data on a
       network connection, the signal is noted and then the system call that was executing returns with an EINTR
       error code to indicate that it was interrupted. All fine so far.

       The  problem  comes when the code that made the system call sees the EINTR code and decides it's going to
       call it again. Perl doesn't do that, but database code sometimes does. If that happens  then  the  signal
       handler doesn't get called until later. Maybe much later.

       Fortunately there are ways around this which we'll discuss below.  Unfortunately they make signals unsafe
       again.

       The  two  most  common  uses of signals in relation to the DBI are for canceling operations when the user
       types Ctrl-C (interrupt), and for implementing a timeout using alarm() and $SIG{ALRM}.

       Cancel
           The DBI provides a "cancel" method for statement  handles.  The  "cancel"  method  should  abort  the
           current operation and is designed to be called from a signal handler.  For example:

             $SIG{INT} = sub { $sth-&gt;cancel };

           However,  few  drivers  implement  this (the DBI provides a default method that just returns "undef")
           and, even if implemented, there is still a possibility that the statement handle, and even the parent
           database handle, will not be usable afterwards.

           If "cancel" returns true, then it has successfully invoked the database engine's own cancel function.
           If it returns false, then "cancel" failed. If it returns "undef", then the database driver  does  not
           have cancel implemented - very few do.

       Timeout
           The  traditional  way  to implement a timeout is to set $SIG{ALRM} to refer to some code that will be
           executed when an ALRM signal arrives and then to call alarm($seconds) to schedule an ALRM  signal  to
           be delivered $seconds in the future. For example:

             my $failed;
             eval {
               local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die "TIMEOUT\n" }; # N.B. \n required
               eval {
                 alarm($seconds);
                 ... code to execute with timeout here (which may die) ...
                 1;
               } or $failed = 1;
               # outer eval catches alarm that might fire JUST before this <a href="../man0/alarm.0.html">alarm</a>(0)
               <a href="../man0/alarm.0.html">alarm</a>(0);  # cancel alarm (if code ran fast)
               die "$@" if $failed;
               1;
             } or $failed = 1;
             if ( $failed ) {
               if ( defined $@ and $@ eq "TIMEOUT\n" ) { ... }
               else { ... } # some other error
             }

           The  first  (outer) eval is used to avoid the unlikely but possible chance that the "code to execute"
           dies and the alarm fires before it is cancelled. Without  the  outer  eval,  if  this  happened  your
           program will die if you have no ALRM handler or a non-local alarm handler will be called.

           Unfortunately, as described above, this won't always work as expected, depending on your perl version
           and the underlying database code.

           With  Oracle  for  instance  (DBD::Oracle),  if  the  system  which  hosts  the  database is down the
           DBI-&gt;<b>connect()</b> call will hang for several minutes before returning an error.

       The solution on these systems is to use the POSIX::sigaction() routine to gain low level  access  to  how
       the signal handler is installed.

       The code would look something like this (for the DBD-Oracle <b>connect()</b>):

          use POSIX qw(:signal_h);

          my $mask = POSIX::SigSet-&gt;new( SIGALRM ); # signals to mask in the handler
          my $action = POSIX::SigAction-&gt;new(
              sub { die "connect timeout\n" },        # the handler code ref
              $mask,
              # not using (perl 5.8.2 and later) 'safe' switch or sa_flags
          );
          my $oldaction = POSIX::SigAction-&gt;new();
          sigaction( SIGALRM, $action, $oldaction );
          my $dbh;
          my $failed;
          eval {
             eval {
               <a href="../man5/alarm.5.html">alarm</a>(5); # seconds before time out
               $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Oracle:$dsn" ... );
               1;
             } or $failed = 1;
             <a href="../man0/alarm.0.html">alarm</a>(0); # cancel alarm (if connect worked fast)
             die "$@\n" if $failed; # connect died
             1;
          } or $failed = 1;
          sigaction( SIGALRM, $oldaction );  # restore original signal handler
          if ( $failed ) {
            if ( defined $@ and $@ eq "connect timeout\n" ) {...}
            else { # connect died }
          }

       See previous example for the reasoning around the double eval.

       Similar techniques can be used for canceling statement execution.

       Unfortunately,  this  solution  is somewhat messy, and it does <u>not</u> work with perl versions less than perl
       5.8 where POSIX::sigaction() appears to be broken.

       For a cleaner implementation that works across perl versions, see Lincoln Baxter's Sys::SigAction  module
       at  Sys::SigAction.   The documentation for Sys::SigAction includes an longer discussion of this problem,
       and a DBD::Oracle test script.

       Be sure to read all the signal handling sections of the perlipc manual.

       And finally, two more points to keep firmly in mind. Firstly, remember  that  what  we've  done  here  is
       essentially  revert  to  old  style  <u>unsafe</u> handling of these signals. So do as little as possible in the
       handler.  Ideally just <b>die()</b>. Secondly, the handles in use at the time the signal is handled may  not  be
       safe to use afterwards.

   <b>Subclassing</b> <b>the</b> <b>DBI</b>
       DBI  can be subclassed and extended just like any other object oriented module.  Before we talk about how
       to do that, it's important to be clear about the various DBI classes and how they work together.

       By default "$dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(...)"  returns  a  $dbh  blessed  into  the  "DBI::db"  class.   And  the
       "$dbh-&gt;prepare"  method  returns an $sth blessed into the "DBI::st" class (actually it simply changes the
       last four characters of the calling handle class to be "::st").

       The leading '"DBI"' is known as the 'root class' and the extra '"::db"' or '"::st"' are the 'handle  type
       suffixes'.  If  you  want  to  subclass  the  DBI  you'll  need  to  put your overriding methods into the
       appropriate classes.  For example, if you want to use a root class of "MySubDBI" and override  the  <b>do()</b>,
       <b>prepare()</b>  and  <b>execute()</b>  methods,  then your <b>do()</b> and <b>prepare()</b> methods should be in the "MySubDBI::db"
       class and the <b>execute()</b> method should be in the "MySubDBI::st" class.

       To setup the inheritance hierarchy the @ISA variable in "MySubDBI::db" should include "DBI::db"  and  the
       @ISA  variable  in  "MySubDBI::st"  should  include  "DBI::st".   The  "MySubDBI" root class itself isn't
       currently used for anything visible and so, apart from setting @ISA to include  "DBI",  it  can  be  left
       empty.

       So,  having  put your overriding methods into the right classes, and setup the inheritance hierarchy, how
       do you get the DBI to use them?  You have two choices, either a static method call using the name of your
       subclass:

         $dbh = MySubDBI-&gt;connect(...);

       or specifying a "RootClass" attribute:

         $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(..., { RootClass =&gt; 'MySubDBI' });

       If both forms are used then the attribute takes precedence.

       The only differences between the two are that using an explicit RootClass attribute will a) make the  DBI
       automatically  attempt  to  load a module by that name if the class doesn't exist, and b) won't call your
       <b>MySubDBI::connect()</b> method, if you have one.

       When  subclassing  is  being  used  then,  after  a  successful  new  connect,  the  DBI-&gt;connect  method
       automatically calls:

         $dbh-&gt;connected($dsn, $user, $pass, \%attr);

       The  default  method  does nothing. The call is made just to simplify any post-connection setup that your
       subclass may want to perform.  The parameters are the same as passed to DBI-&gt;connect.  If  your  subclass
       supplies a connected method, it should be part of the MySubDBI::db package.

       One  more  thing  to  note:  you  must  let  the DBI do the handle creation.  If you want to override the
       <b>connect()</b> method in your *::dr class then it must still call SUPER::connect to get a $dbh to  work  with.
       Similarly,  an overridden <b>prepare()</b> method in *::db must still call SUPER::prepare to get a $sth.  If you
       try to create your own handles using <b>bless()</b> then you'll find the DBI will reject them with an "is not  a
       DBI handle (has no magic)" error.

       Here's  a  brief  example of a DBI subclass.  A more thorough example can be found in <u>t/subclass.t</u> in the
       DBI distribution.

         package MySubDBI;

         use strict;

         use DBI;
         our @ISA = qw(DBI);

         package MySubDBI::db;
         our @ISA = qw(DBI::db);

         sub prepare {
           my ($dbh, @args) = @_;
           my $sth = $dbh-&gt;SUPER::prepare(@args)
               or return;
           $sth-&gt;{private_mysubdbi_info} = { foo =&gt; 'bar' };
           return $sth;
         }

         package MySubDBI::st;
         our @ISA = qw(DBI::st);

         sub fetch {
           my ($sth, @args) = @_;
           my $row = $sth-&gt;SUPER::fetch(@args)
               or return;
           do_something_magical_with_row_data($row)
               or return $sth-&gt;set_err(1234, "The magic failed", undef, "fetch");
           return $row;
         }

       When calling a SUPER::method that returns a handle, be careful to check the return value before trying to
       do other things with it in your overridden method. This is especially important if you want to set a hash
       attribute on the handle, as Perl's  autovivification  will  bite  you  by  (in)conveniently  creating  an
       unblessed  hashref,  which  your  method will then return with usually baffling results later on like the
       error "dbih_getcom handle <a href="../man0xa4451a8/HASH.0xa4451a8.html">HASH</a>(0xa4451a8) is not a DBI handle (has no magic".  It's best to  check  right
       after  the  call  and  return  undef  immediately on error, just like DBI would and just like the example
       above.

       If your method needs to record an error it should call the <b>set_err()</b> method with the error code and error
       string, as shown in the example above. The error code and error string will be recorded in the handle and
       available via "$h-&gt;err" and $DBI::errstr etc.  The <b>set_err()</b> method always returns an undef or empty list
       as appropriate. Since your method should nearly always return an undef or empty list as soon as an  error
       is detected it's handy to simply return what <b>set_err()</b> returns, as shown in the example above.

       If  the  handle  has "RaiseError", "PrintError", or "HandleError" etc. set then the <b>set_err()</b> method will
       honour them. This means that if "RaiseError" is set then <b>set_err()</b> won't return in  the  normal  way  but
       will 'throw an exception' that can be caught with an "eval" block.

       You  can  stash private data into DBI handles via "$h-&gt;{private_..._*}".  See the entry under "ATTRIBUTES
       COMMON TO ALL HANDLES" for info and important caveats.

   <b>Memory</b> <b>Leaks</b>
       When tracking down memory leaks using tools like Devel::Leak you'll find  that  some  DBI  internals  are
       reported  as  'leaking'  memory.  This is very unlikely to be a real leak.  The DBI has various caches to
       improve performance and the apparrent leaks are simply the normal operation of these caches.

       The  most  frequent  sources  of  the  apparrent   leaks   are   "ChildHandles",   "prepare_cached"   and
       "connect_cached".

       For example <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13338308/perl-dbi-memory-leak">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13338308/perl-dbi-memory-leak</a>

       Given  how  widely the DBI is used, you can rest assured that if a new release of the DBI did have a real
       leak it would be discovered, reported, and fixed immediately. The leak you're  looking  for  is  probably
       elsewhere. Good luck!

</pre><h4><b>TRACING</b></h4><pre>
       The  DBI  has  a  powerful  tracing mechanism built in. It enables you to see what's going on 'behind the
       scenes', both within the DBI and the drivers you're using.

   <b>Trace</b> <b>Settings</b>
       Which details are written to the trace output is controlled by a combination of a <u>trace</u> <u>level</u>, an integer
       from 0 to 15, and a set of <u>trace</u> <u>flags</u> that are either on or off. Together these are known as  the  <u>trace</u>
       <u>settings</u>  and  are  stored  together  in a single integer.  For normal use you only need to set the trace
       level, and generally only to a value between 1 and 4.

       Each handle has its own trace settings, and so does the DBI.  When you call a method the DBI  merges  the
       handles  settings  into its own for the duration of the call: the trace flags of the handle are OR'd into
       the trace flags of the DBI, and if the handle has a higher trace level then the DBI trace level is raised
       to match it.  The previous DBI trace settings are restored when the called method returns.

   <b>Trace</b> <b>Levels</b>
       Trace <u>levels</u> are as follows:

         0 - Trace disabled.
         1 - Trace top-level DBI method calls returning with results or errors.
         2 - As above, adding tracing of top-level method entry with parameters.
         3 - As above, adding some high-level information from the driver
             and some internal information from the DBI.
         4 - As above, adding more detailed information from the driver.
             This is the first level to trace all the rows being fetched.
         5 to 15 - As above but with more and more internal information.

       Trace level 1 is best for a simple overview of what's happening.  Trace levels 2 thru 4 a good choice for
       general purpose tracing.  Levels 5 and above are best reserved for investigating a specific problem, when
       you need to see "inside" the driver and DBI.

       The trace output is detailed and typically very useful. Much of the trace output is formatted  using  the
       "neat" function, so strings in the trace output may be edited and truncated by that function.

   <b>Trace</b> <b>Flags</b>
       Trace <u>flags</u> are used to enable tracing of specific activities within the DBI and drivers. The DBI defines
       some  trace  flags  and  drivers  can define others. DBI trace flag names begin with a capital letter and
       driver specific names begin with a lowercase letter, as usual.

       Currently the DBI defines these trace flags:

         ALL - turn on all DBI and driver flags (not recommended)
         SQL - trace SQL statements executed
               (not yet implemented in DBI but implemented in some DBDs)
         CON - trace connection process
         ENC - trace encoding (unicode translations etc)
               (not yet implemented in DBI but implemented in some DBDs)
         DBD - trace only DBD messages
               (not implemented by all DBDs yet)
         TXN - trace transactions
               (not implemented in all DBDs yet)

       The "parse_trace_flags" and "parse_trace_flag" methods are used to convert  trace  flag  names  into  the
       corresponding integer bit flags.

   <b>Enabling</b> <b>Trace</b>
       The "$h-&gt;trace" method sets the trace settings for a handle and "DBI-&gt;trace" does the same for the DBI.

       In  addition to the "trace" method, you can enable the same trace information, and direct the output to a
       file, by setting the "DBI_TRACE" environment variable before starting Perl.   See  "DBI_TRACE"  for  more
       information.

       Finally, you can set, or get, the trace settings for a handle using the "TraceLevel" attribute.

       All of those methods use <b>parse_trace_flags()</b> and so allow you set both the trace level and multiple trace
       flags by using a string containing the trace level and/or flag names separated by vertical bar (""|"") or
       comma ("","") characters. For example:

         local $h-&gt;{TraceLevel} = "3|SQL|foo";

   <b>Trace</b> <b>Output</b>
       Initially  trace  output  is  written to "STDERR".  Both the "$h-&gt;trace" and "DBI-&gt;trace" methods take an
       optional $trace_file parameter, which may be either the name of a file to be  opened  by  DBI  in  append
       mode, or a reference to an existing writable (possibly layered) filehandle. If $trace_file is a filename,
       and  can  be  opened  in  append  mode,  or  $trace_file  is a writable filehandle, then <u>all</u> trace output
       (currently including that from other handles) is redirected to that  file.  A  warning  is  generated  if
       $trace_file can't be opened or is not writable.

       Further  calls to <b>trace()</b> without $trace_file do not alter where the trace output is sent. If $trace_file
       is undefined, then trace output is sent to "STDERR" and, if the prior trace was opened  with  $trace_file
       as  a filename, the previous trace file is closed; if $trace_file was a filehandle, the filehandle is <b>not</b>
       closed.

       <b>NOTE</b>: If $trace_file is specified as a filehandle, the filehandle should not  be  closed  until  all  DBI
       operations  are  completed,  or the application has reset the trace file via another call to trace() that
       changes the trace file.

   <b>Tracing</b> <b>to</b> <b>Layered</b> <b>Filehandles</b>
       <b>NOTE</b>:

       •   Tied filehandles are not currently supported, as tie operations  are  not  available  to  the  PerlIO
           methods used by the DBI.

       •   PerlIO layer support requires Perl version 5.8 or higher.

       As of version 5.8, Perl provides the ability to layer various "disciplines" on an open filehandle via the
       PerlIO module.

       A simple example of using PerlIO layers is to use a scalar as the output:

           my $scalar = '';
           open( my $fh, "+&gt;:scalar", \$scalar );
           $dbh-&gt;trace( 2, $fh );

       Now all trace output is simply appended to $scalar.

       A  more  complex  application  of  tracing to a layered filehandle is the use of a custom layer (<u>Refer</u> <u>to</u>
       Perlio::via <u>for</u> <u>details</u> <u>on</u> <u>creating</u> <u>custom</u> <u>PerlIO</u> <u>layers.</u>). Consider an application  with  the  following
       logger module:

           package MyFancyLogger;

           sub new
           {
               my $self = {};
               my $fh;
               open $fh, '&gt;', 'fancylog.log';
               $self-&gt;{_fh} = $fh;
               $self-&gt;{_buf} = '';
               return bless $self, shift;
           }

           sub log
           {
               my $self = shift;
               return unless exists $self-&gt;{_fh};
               my $fh = $self-&gt;{_fh};
               $self-&gt;{_buf} .= shift;
           #
           # DBI feeds us pieces at a time, so accumulate a complete line
           # before outputting
           #
               print $fh "At ", scalar localtime(), ':', $self-&gt;{_buf}, "\n" and
               $self-&gt;{_buf} = ''
                   if $self-&gt;{_buf}=~tr/\n//;
           }

           sub close {
               my $self = shift;
               return unless exists $self-&gt;{_fh};
               my $fh = $self-&gt;{_fh};
               print $fh "At ", scalar localtime(), ':', $self-&gt;{_buf}, "\n" and
               $self-&gt;{_buf} = ''
                   if $self-&gt;{_buf};
               close $fh;
               delete $self-&gt;{_fh};
           }

           1;

       To redirect DBI traces to this logger requires creating a package for the layer:

           package PerlIO::via::MyFancyLogLayer;

           sub PUSHED
           {
               my ($class,$mode,$fh) = @_;
               my $logger;
               return bless \$logger,$class;
           }

           sub OPEN {
               my ($self, $path, $mode, $fh) = @_;
               #
               # $path is actually our logger object
               #
               $$self = $path;
               return 1;
           }

           sub WRITE
           {
               my ($self, $buf, $fh) = @_;
               $$self-&gt;log($buf);
               return length($buf);
           }

           sub CLOSE {
               my $self = shift;
               $$self-&gt;close();
               return 0;
           }

           1;

       The application can then cause DBI traces to be routed to the logger using

           use PerlIO::via::MyFancyLogLayer;

           open my $fh, '&gt;:via(MyFancyLogLayer)', MyFancyLogger-&gt;new();

           $dbh-&gt;trace('SQL', $fh);

       Now all trace output will be processed by MyFancyLogger's <b>log()</b> method.

   <b>Trace</b> <b>Content</b>
       Many  of  the values embedded in trace output are formatted using the <b>neat()</b> utility function. This means
       they may be quoted, sanitized, and possibly truncated if longer than $DBI::neat_maxlen.  See  "neat"  for
       more details.

   <b>Tracing</b> <b>Tips</b>
       You can add tracing to your own application code using the "trace_msg" method.

       It  can  sometimes  be  handy  to compare trace files from two different runs of the same script. However
       using a tool like "diff" on the original log output doesn't work well because the trace file is  full  of
       object addresses that may differ on each run.

       The  DBI  includes a handy utility called dbilogstrip that can be used to 'normalize' the log content. It
       can be used as a filter like this:

           DBI_TRACE=2 perl yourscript.pl ...args1... 2&gt;&amp;1 | dbilogstrip &gt; dbitrace1.log
           DBI_TRACE=2 perl yourscript.pl ...args2... 2&gt;&amp;1 | dbilogstrip &gt; dbitrace2.log
           diff -u dbitrace1.log dbitrace2.log

       See dbilogstrip for more information.

</pre><h4><b>DBI</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The DBI module recognizes a number of environment variables, but most of them should not be used most  of
       the  time.   It  is  better  to  be  explicit  about what you are doing to avoid the need for environment
       variables, especially in a web serving system where  web  servers  are  stingy  about  which  environment
       variables are available.

   <b>DBI_DSN</b>
       The  DBI_DSN  environment  variable  is used by DBI-&gt;connect if you do not specify a data source when you
       issue the connect.  It should have a format such as "dbi:Driver:databasename".

   <b>DBI_DRIVER</b>
       The DBI_DRIVER environment variable is used to fill in the database driver name in  DBI-&gt;connect  if  the
       data  source  string  starts  "dbi::"  (thereby  omitting the driver).  If DBI_DSN omits the driver name,
       DBI_DRIVER can fill the gap.

   <b>DBI_AUTOPROXY</b>
       The DBI_AUTOPROXY environment variable takes a string value that starts  "dbi:Proxy:"  and  is  typically
       followed  by  "hostname=...;port=...".   It  is  used  to  alter the behaviour of DBI-&gt;connect.  For full
       details, see DBI::Proxy documentation.

   <b>DBI_USER</b>
       The DBI_USER environment variable takes a string value that is used as the user name if the  DBI-&gt;connect
       call is given undef (as distinct from an empty string) as the username argument.  Be wary of the security
       implications of using this.

   <b>DBI_PASS</b>
       The  DBI_PASS  environment variable takes a string value that is used as the password if the DBI-&gt;connect
       call is given undef (as distinct from an empty string) as the password argument.  Be extra  wary  of  the
       security implications of using this.

   <b>DBI_DBNAME</b> <b>(obsolete)</b>
       The  DBI_DBNAME environment variable takes a string value that is used only when the obsolescent style of
       DBI-&gt;connect (with driver name as fourth parameter) is used, and when no value is provided for the  first
       (database name) argument.

   <b>DBI_TRACE</b>
       The  DBI_TRACE  environment  variable specifies the global default trace settings for the DBI at startup.
       Can also be used to direct trace output to a file. When the DBI is loaded it does:

         DBI-&gt;trace(split /=/, $ENV{DBI_TRACE}, 2) if $ENV{DBI_TRACE};

       So if "DBI_TRACE" contains an ""="" character then what follows it is used as the name  of  the  file  to
       append the trace to.

       output  appended to that file. If the name begins with a number followed by an equal sign ("="), then the
       number and the equal sign are stripped off from the name, and the number is used to set the trace  level.
       For example:

         DBI_TRACE=1=dbitrace.log perl your_test_script.pl

       On Unix-like systems using a Bourne-like shell, you can do this easily on the command line:

         DBI_TRACE=2 perl your_test_script.pl

       See "TRACING" for more information.

   <b>PERL_DBI_DEBUG</b> <b>(obsolete)</b>
       An old variable that should no longer be used; equivalent to DBI_TRACE.

   <b>DBI_PROFILE</b>
       The  DBI_PROFILE  environment  variable  can  be  used  to  enable  profiling  of  DBI  method calls. See
       DBI::Profile for more information.

   <b>DBI_PUREPERL</b>
       The DBI_PUREPERL environment variable can be used to enable the use of DBI::PurePerl.  See  DBI::PurePerl
       for more information.

       Can't call method "prepare" without a package or object reference
           The  $dbh handle you're using to call "prepare" is probably undefined because the preceding "connect"
           failed. You should always check the return status of DBI methods, or use the "RaiseError" attribute.

       Can't call method "execute" without a package or object reference
           The $sth handle you're using to call "execute" is probably undefined because the preceding  "prepare"
           failed. You should always check the return status of DBI methods, or use the "RaiseError" attribute.

       DBI/DBD internal version mismatch
           The  DBD  driver  module was built with a different version of DBI than the one currently being used.
           You should rebuild the DBD module under the current version of DBI.

           (Some rare platforms require "static linking". On those platforms, there may be an  old  DBI  or  DBD
           driver version actually embedded in the Perl executable being used.)

       DBD driver has not implemented the AutoCommit attribute
           The DBD driver implementation is incomplete. Consult the author.

       Can't [sg]et %s-&gt;{%s}: unrecognised attribute
           You  attempted  to  set  or  get  an  unknown  attribute of a handle.  Make sure you have spelled the
           attribute name correctly; case is significant (e.g., "Autocommit" is not the same as "AutoCommit").

</pre><h4><b>Pure-Perl</b> <b>DBI</b></h4><pre>
       A pure-perl emulation of the DBI is included in the distribution for people using pure-perl drivers  who,
       for whatever reason, can't install the compiled DBI. See DBI::PurePerl.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b> <b>/</b> <b>WARRANTY</b></h4><pre>
       The DBI is free Open Source software. IT COMES WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

   <b>Support</b>
       My consulting company, Data Plan Services, offers annual and multi-annual support contracts for the  DBI.
       These  provide  sustained support for DBI development, and sustained value for you in return.  Contact me
       for details.

   <b>Sponsor</b> <b>Enhancements</b>
       If your company  would  benefit  from  a  specific  new  DBI  feature,  please  consider  sponsoring  its
       development.  Work is performed rapidly, and usually on a fixed-price payment-on-delivery basis.  Contact
       me for details.

       Using  such  targeted  financing  allows  you to contribute to DBI development, and rapidly get something
       specific and valuable in return.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       I would like to acknowledge the valuable contributions of the many people I have worked with on  the  DBI
       project,  especially in the early years (1992-1994). In no particular order: Kevin Stock, Buzz Moschetti,
       Kurt Andersen, Ted Lemon, William Hails, Garth Kennedy, Michael Peppler, Neil S.  Briscoe,  Jeff  Urlwin,
       David  J.  Hughes,  Jeff  Stander,  Forrest D Whitcher, Larry Wall, Jeff Fried, Roy Johnson, Paul Hudson,
       Georg Rehfeld, Steve Sizemore, Ron Pool, Jon Meek, Tom Christiansen, Steve Baumgarten,  Randal  Schwartz,
       and a whole lot more.

       Then, of course, there are the poor souls who have struggled through untold and undocumented obstacles to
       actually  implement  DBI  drivers.   Among their ranks are Jochen Wiedmann, Alligator Descartes, Jonathan
       Leffler, Jeff Urlwin, Michael Peppler, Henrik Tougaard, Edwin Pratomo, Davide Migliavacca, Jan Pazdziora,
       Peter Haworth, Edmund Mergl, Steve Williams, Thomas Lowery, and Phlip  Plumlee.  Without  them,  the  DBI
       would  not be the practical reality it is today.  I'm also especially grateful to Alligator Descartes for
       starting work on the first edition of the "Programming the Perl DBI" book and letting me jump on board.

       The DBI and DBD::Oracle were originally developed while I was Technical Director (CTO) of the Paul Ingram
       Group in the UK.  So I'd especially like to thank Paul for his generosity and vision in  supporting  this
       work for many years.

       A couple of specific DBI features have been sponsored by enlightened companies:

       The development of the <b>swap_inner_handle()</b> method was sponsored by BizRate.com (&lt;<a href="http://BizRate.com">http://BizRate.com</a>&gt;)

       The development of DBD::Gofer and related modules was sponsored by Shopzilla.com (https::connexity.com).

</pre><h4><b>CONTRIBUTING</b></h4><pre>
       As you can see above, many people have contributed to the DBI and drivers in many ways over many years.

       If you'd like to help then see &lt;<a href="http://dbi.perl.org/contributing">http://dbi.perl.org/contributing</a>&gt;.

       If  you'd  like  the DBI to do something new or different then a good way to make that happen is to do it
       yourself and send me a patch to the source code that shows the  changes.  (But  read  "Speak  before  you
       patch" below.)

   <b>Browsing</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>code</b> <b>repository</b>
       Use https://github.com/perl5-dbi/dbi

   <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>using</b> <b>Git</b>
       The  DBI  source code is maintained using Git.  To access the source you'll need to install a Git client.
       Then, to get the source code, do:

         git clone https://github.com/perl5-dbi/dbi.git DBI-git

       The source code will now be available in the new subdirectory "DBI-git".

       When you want to synchronize later, issue the command

         git pull --all

       Make your changes, test them, test them again until everything passes.  If there are no tests for the new
       feature you added or a behaviour change, the change should include a new test. Then commit  the  changes.
       Either use

         git gui

       or

         git commit -a -m 'Message to my changes'

       If you get any conflicts reported you'll need to fix them first.

       Then generate the patch file to be mailed:

         git format-patch -1 --attach

       which will create a file 0001-*.patch (where * relates to the commit message).  Read the patch file, as a
       sanity check, and then email it to <a href="mailto:dbi-dev@perl.org">dbi-dev@perl.org</a>.

       If  you have a github &lt;https://github.com&gt; account, you can also fork the repository, commit your changes
       to the forked repository and then do a pull request.

   <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>without</b> <b>Git</b>
       Unpack a fresh copy of the distribution:

         wget <a href="http://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/T/TI/TIMB/DBI-1.627.tar.gz">http://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/T/TI/TIMB/DBI-1.627.tar.gz</a>
         tar xfz DBI-1.627.tar.gz

       Rename the newly created top level directory:

         mv DBI-1.627 DBI-1.627.your_foo

       Edit the contents of DBI-1.627.your_foo/* till it does what you want.

       Test your changes and then remove all temporary files:

         make test &amp;&amp; make distclean

       Go back to the directory you originally unpacked the distribution:

         cd ..

       Unpack <u>another</u> copy of the original distribution you started with:

         tar xfz DBI-1.627.tar.gz

       Then create a patch file by performing a recursive "diff" on the two top level directories:

         diff -purd DBI-1.627 DBI-1.627.your_foo &gt; DBI-1.627.your_foo.patch

   <b>Speak</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>patch</b>
       For anything non-trivial or possibly controversial it's a good idea to discuss (on <a href="mailto:dbi-dev@perl.org">dbi-dev@perl.org</a>)  the
       changes  you  propose  before  actually spending time working on them. Otherwise you run the risk of them
       being rejected because they don't fit into some larger plans you may not be aware of.

       You can also reach the developers on IRC (chat). If they are on-line, the most likely place  to  talk  to
       them is the #dbi channel on irc.perl.org

       Apache::DBI
           To  be  used  with  the  Apache  daemon  together  with an embedded Perl interpreter like "mod_perl".
           Establishes a database connection which remains open for the lifetime of the HTTP  daemon.  This  way
           the CGI connect and disconnect for every database access becomes superfluous.
