</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SQL::Statement - SQL parsing and processing engine

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # ... depends on what you want to do, see below

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The SQL::Statement module implements a pure Perl SQL parsing and execution engine. While it by no means
       implements full ANSI standard, it does support many features including column and table aliases, built-in
       and user-defined functions, implicit and explicit joins, complex nested search conditions, and other
       features.

       SQL::Statement is a small embeddable Database Management System (DBMS). This means that it provides all
       of the services of a simple DBMS except that instead of a persistent storage mechanism, it has two
       things: 1) an in-memory storage mechanism that allows you to prepare, execute, and fetch from SQL
       statements using temporary tables and 2) a set of software sockets where any author can plug in any
       storage mechanism.

       There are three main uses for SQL::Statement. One or another (hopefully not all) may be irrelevant for
       your needs: 1) to access and manipulate data in CSV, XML, and other formats 2) to build your own DBD for
       a new data source 3) to parse and examine the structure of SQL statements.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       There are no prerequisites for using this as a standalone parser. If you want to access persistent stored
       data, you either need to write a subclass or use one of the DBI DBD drivers.  You can install this module
       using CPAN.pm, CPANPLUS.pm, PPM, apt-get, or other packaging tools or you can download the tar.gz file
       from CPAN and use the standard perl mantra:

         perl Makefile.PL
         make
         make test
         make install

       It works fine on all platforms it has been tested on. On Windows, you can use ppm or with the mantra use
       nmake, dmake, or make depending on which is available.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>SQL::Statement</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> <b>and</b> <b>modify</b> <b>data?</b>
       SQL::Statement provides the SQL engine for a number of existing DBI drivers including DBD::CSV, DBD::DBM,
       DBD::AnyData, DBD::Excel, DBD::Amazon, and others.

       These modules provide access to Comma Separated Values, Fixed Length, XML, HTML and many other kinds of
       text files, to Excel Spreadsheets, to BerkeleyDB and other DBM formats, and to non-traditional data
       sources like on-the-fly Amazon searches.

       If you are interested in accessing and manipulating persistent data, you may not really want to use
       SQL::Statement directly, but use DBI along with one of the DBDs mentioned above instead. You will be
       using SQL::Statement, but under the hood of the DBD. See &lt;<a href="http://dbi.perl.org">http://dbi.perl.org</a>&gt; for help with DBI and see
       SQL::Statement::Syntax for a description of the SQL syntax that SQL::Statement provides for these modules
       and see the documentation for whichever DBD you are using for additional details.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>parse</b> <b>and</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>SQL</b> <b>statements?</b>
       SQL::Statement can be used stand-alone (without a subclass and without DBI) to parse and examine the
       structure of SQL statements.  See SQL::Statement::Structure for details.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>embed</b> <b>a</b> <b>SQL</b> <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>DBD</b> <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>module?</b>
       SQL::Statement is designed to be easily embedded in other modules and is especially suited for developing
       new DBI drivers (DBDs).  See SQL::Statement::Embed.

   <b>What</b> <b>SQL</b> <b>Syntax</b> <b>is</b> <b>supported?</b>
       SQL::Statement supports a small but powerful subset of SQL commands.  See SQL::Statement::Syntax.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>extend</b> <b>the</b> <b>supported</b> <b>SQL</b> <b>syntax?</b>
       You can modify and extend the SQL syntax either by issuing SQL commands or by subclassing SQL::Statement.
       See SQL::Statement::Syntax.

</pre><h4><b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>ongoing</b> <b>development?</b></h4><pre>
       SQL::Statement is a large module with many potential future directions.  You are invited to help plan,
       code, test, document, or kibbitz about these directions. If you want to join the development team, or
       just hear more about the development, write Jeff (&lt;jzuckerATcpan.org&gt;) or Jens (&lt;rehsackATcpan.org&gt;) a
       note.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods can or must be overridden by derived classes.

   <b>capability</b>
         $has_capability = $h-&gt;capability('capability_name');

       Returns a true value if the specified capability is available.

       Currently no capabilities are defined and this is a placeholder for future use. It is envisioned it will
       be used like "SQL::Eval::Table::capability".

   <b>open_table</b>
       The "open_table" method must be overridden by derived classes to provide the capability of opening data
       tables. This is a necessity.

       Arguments given to open_table call:

       $data
           The database memo parameter. See "execute".

       $table
           The name of the table to open as parsed from SQL statement.

       $createMode
           A  flag indicating the mode ("CREATE TABLE ...") the table should be opened with. Set to a true value
           in create mode.

       $lockMode
           A flag indicating whether the table should be opened for writing (any other than "SELECT ...").   Set
           to a true value if the table is to be opened for write access.

       The following methods are required to use SQL::Statement in a DBD (for example).

   <b>new</b>
       Instantiates a new SQL::Statement object.

       Arguments:

       $sql
           The SQL statement for later actions.

       $parser
           An  instance  of a SQL::Parser object or flags for it's instantiation.  If omitted, default flags are
           used.

       When the basic initialization is completed, "$self-&gt;prepare($sql, $parser)" is invoked.

   <b>prepare</b>
       Prepares SQL::Statement to execute a SQL statement.

       Arguments:

       $sql
           The SQL statement to parse and prepare.

       $parser
           Instance of a SQL::Parser object to parse the provided SQL statement.

   <b>execute</b>
       Executes a prepared statement.

       Arguments:

       $data
           Memo field passed through to calls of the instantiated  $table  objects  or  "open_table"  calls.  In
           "CREATE" with subquery, "$data-&gt;{Database}" must be a DBI database handle object.

       $params
           Bound params via DBI ...

   <b>errstr</b>
       Gives the error string of the last error, if any.

   <b>fetch_row</b>
       Fetches  the  next  row  from  the result data set (implies removing the fetched row from the result data
       set).

   <b>fetch_rows</b>
       Fetches all (remaining) rows from the result data set.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Jochen  Wiedmann  created  the original module as an XS (C) extension in 1998.  Jeff Zucker took over the
       maintenance in 2001 and rewrote all of the C portions in Perl and began extending the SQL support.   More
       recently  Ilya  Sterin  provided  help  with  SQL::Parser,  Tim  Bunce provided both general and specific
       support, Dan Wright and Dean Arnold have contributed extensively to the code, and dozens of  people  from
       around the world have submitted patches, bug reports, and suggestions.

       In  2008 Jens Rehsack took over the maintenance of the extended module from Jeff.  Together with H.Merijn
       Brand (who has taken DBD::CSV), Detlef Wartke and Volker Schubbert  (especially  between  1.16  developer
       versions until 1.22) and all submitters of bug reports via RT a lot of issues have been fixed.

       Thanks to all!

       If you're interested in helping develop SQL::Statement or want to use it with your own modules, feel free
       to contact Jeff or Jens.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       •   Currently we treat NULL and '' as the same in AnyData/CSV mode - eventually fix.

       •   No nested C-style comments allowed as SQL99 says.

       •   There are some issues regarding combining outer joins with where clauses.

       •   Aggregate functions cannot be used in where clause.

       •   Some  SQL commands/features are not supported (most of them cannot by design), as "LOCK TABLE", using
           indices, sub-selects etc.

           Currently the statement for missing features is: I plan to create a SQL::Statement v2.00 based  on  a
           pure Backus-Naur-Form parser and a fully object oriented command pattern based engine implementation.
           When  the  time is available, I will do it. Until then bugs will be fixed or other Perl modules under
           my maintainership will receive my time. Features which can be added without deep design changes might
           be applied earlier - especially when their addition allows studying effective ways to  implement  the
           feature in upcoming 2.00.

       •   Some  people  report  that SQL::Statement is slower since the XS parts were implemented in pure Perl.
           This might be true, but on the other hand a large  number  of  features  have  been  added  including
           support for ANSI SQL 99.

           For SQL::Statement 1.xx it's not planned to add new XS parts.

       •   Wildcards  are expanded to lower cased identifiers. This might confuse some people, but it was easier
           to implement.

           The warning in DBI to never trust the case of returned column names should be read more often. If you
           need to rely on identifiers,  always  use  "sth-&gt;{NAME_lc}"  or  "sth-&gt;{NAME_uc}"  -  never  rely  on
           "sth-&gt;{NAME}":

             $dbh-&gt;{FetchHashKeyName} = 'NAME_lc';
             $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("SELECT FOO, BAR, ID, NAME, BAZ FROM TABLE");
             $sth-&gt;execute;
             $hash_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchall_hashref('id');
             print "Name for id 42 is $hash_ref-&gt;{42}-&gt;{name}\n";

           See "FetchHashKeyName" in DBI for more information.

       •   Unable to use the same table twice with different aliases. <b>Workaround</b>: Temporary tables: "CREATE TEMP
           TABLE t_foo AS SELECT * FROM foo".  Than both tables can be used independently.

       Patches  to  fix  bugs/limitations  (or  a  grant  to do it) would be very welcome. Please note, that any
       patches <b>must</b> successfully pass all the "SQL::Statement", DBD::File and  DBD::CSV  tests  and  must  be  a
       general improvement.
