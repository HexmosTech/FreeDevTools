</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PPI::Statement::Compound - Describes all compound statements

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # A compound if statement
         if ( foo ) {
             bar();
         } else {
             baz();
         }

         # A compound loop statement
         foreach ( @list ) {
             bar($_);
         }

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
         PPI::Statement::Compound
         isa PPI::Statement
             isa PPI::Node
                 isa PPI::Element

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "PPI::Statement::Compound" objects are used to describe all current forms of compound statements, as
       described in perlsyn.

       This covers blocks using "if", "unless", "for", "foreach", "while", and "continue". Please note this does
       <b>not</b> cover "simple" statements with trailing conditions. Please note also that "do" is also not part of a
       compound statement.

         # This is NOT a compound statement
         my $foo = 1 if $condition;

         # This is also not a compound statement
         do { ... } until $condition;

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "PPI::Statement::Compound" has a number of methods in addition to the standard PPI::Statement, PPI::Node
       and PPI::Element methods.

   <b>type</b>
       The "type" method returns the syntactic type of the compound statement.

       There are four basic compound statement types.

       The 'if' type includes all variations of the if and unless statements, including any 'elsif' or 'else'
       parts of the compound statement.

       The 'while' type describes the standard while and until statements, but again does <b>not</b> describes simple
       statements with a trailing while.

       The 'for' type covers the C-style for loops, regardless of whether they were declared using 'for' or
       'foreach'.

       The 'foreach' type covers loops that iterate over collections, regardless of whether they were declared
       using 'for' or 'foreach'.

       All of the compounds are a variation on one of these four.

       Returns the simple string 'if', 'for', 'foreach' or 'while', or "undef" if the type cannot be determined.
