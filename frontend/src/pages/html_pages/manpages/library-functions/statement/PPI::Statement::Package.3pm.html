</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PPI::Statement::Package - A package statement

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
         PPI::Statement::Package
         isa PPI::Statement
             isa PPI::Node
                 isa PPI::Element

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Most PPI::Statement subclasses are assigned based on the value of the first token or word found in the
       statement. When PPI encounters a statement starting with 'package', it converts it to a
       "PPI::Statement::Package" object.

       When working with package statements, please remember that packages only exist within their scope, and
       proper support for scoping has yet to be completed in PPI.

       However, if the immediate parent of the package statement is the top level PPI::Document object, then it
       can be considered to define everything found until the next top-level "file scoped" package statement.

       A file may, however, contain nested temporary package, in which case you are mostly on your own :)

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "PPI::Statement::Package" has a number of methods in addition to the standard PPI::Statement, PPI::Node
       and PPI::Element methods.

   <b>namespace</b>
       Most package declarations are simple, and just look something like

         package Foo::Bar;

       The "namespace" method returns the name of the declared package, in the above case 'Foo::Bar'. It returns
       this exactly as written and does not attempt to clean up or resolve things like ::Foo to main::Foo.

       If the package statement is done any different way, it returns false.

   <b>version</b>
       Some package declarations may include a version:

         package Foo::Bar 1.23;
         package Baz v1.23;

       The "version" method returns the stringified version as seen in the document (if any), otherwise the
       empty string.

   <b>file_scoped</b>
       Regardless of whether it is named or not, the "file_scoped" method will test to see if the package
       declaration is a top level "file scoped" statement or not, based on its location.

       In general, returns true if it is a "file scoped" package declaration with an immediate parent of the top
       level Document, or false if not.

       Note that if the PPI DOM tree <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have a PPI::Document object at as the root element, this will
       return false. Likewise, it will also return false if the root element is a PPI::Document::Fragment, as a
       fragment of a file does not represent a scope.
