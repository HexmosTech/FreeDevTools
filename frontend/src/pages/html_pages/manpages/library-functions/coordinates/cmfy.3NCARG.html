       CMFY - Converts from metacode coordinates to fractional coordinates.

UNIX                                               March 1993                                       <u><a href="../man3NCARG/CMFY.3NCARG.html">CMFY</a></u>(3NCARG)

<u><a href="../man3NCARG/SPPS_converters.3NCARG.html">SPPS_converters</a></u>(3NCARG)                           NCAR GRAPHICS                          <u><a href="../man3NCARG/SPPS_converters.3NCARG.html">SPPS_converters</a></u>(3NCARG)

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       spps_converters - A set of functions, each of which transforms a coordinate from one of the NCAR Graphics
       coordinate systems to another.  The complete list of functions is as follows:  CFUX, CFUY, CMFX, CMFY,
       CMUX, CMUY, CPFX, CPFY, CPUX, CPUY, CUFX, CUFY, KFMX, KFMY, KFPX, KFPY, KMPX, KMPY, KPMX, KPMY, KUMX,
       KUMY, KUPX, and KUPY.

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       Plotter Address Units (PAUs) and Metacode Units (MUs) are no longer used in NCAR Graphics; thus, all
       functions with either an M or a P as the second or third letter of the function name are considered
       obsolete.

       The current recognized coordinate systems are GKS world coordinates, GKS normalized device coordinates,
       NCAR Graphics fractional coordinates, and NCAR Graphics user coordinates.  See the NCAR Graphics document
       "NCAR Graphics Fundamentals, UNIX Version" for descriptions of these coordinate systems.

       The following definitions of the PAU coordinate system and the MU coordinate system are provided for the
       purpose of interpreting and converting codes which use PAUs or MUs:

       The plotter coordinates of a point are integers IPX and IPY, where IPX is between 1 and 2**MX and IPY is
       between 1 and 2**MY.  MX and MY are internal parameters of SPPS; each has a default value of 10.  Values
       of MX and MY can be set by calling the routines SETI or SETUSV and retrieved by calling the routines
       GETSI or GETUSV.

       The metacode coordinates of a point are integers IMX and IMY between 0 and 32767 inclusive.  The area
       addressed is a square in a "metacode space" that is usually mapped into a square subset of the
       addressable area of the plotting device.  Metacode coordinates were used in calls to the routine PLOTIT
       and are returned in calls to FL2INT.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Current:
       X = CFUX (RX),  Y = CFUY(RY)
       X = CUFX (RX),  Y = CUFY(RY)

       Obsolete:
       X = CMUX (IX),  Y = CMUY(IY)
       X = CPUX (IX),  Y = CPUY(IY)
       X = CMFX (IX),  Y = CMFY(IY)
       X = CPFX (IX),  Y = CPFY(IY)
       I = KFMX (RX),  J = KFMY(RY)
       I = KUMX (RX),  J = KUMY(RY)
       I = KFPX (RX),  J = KFPY(RY)
       I = KUPX (RX),  J = KUPY(RY)
       I = KPMX (IX),  J = KPMY(IY)
       I = KMPX (IX),  J = KMPY(IY)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       float c_cfux (float rx)

       float c_cfuy (float ry)

       float c_cufx (float rx)

       float c_cufy (float ry)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       RX          (an  input  expression of type REAL) is an X coordinate in the coordinate system specified by
                   the second letter of the function name.  In a  reference  to  CFUX,  RX  is  a  fractional  X
                   coordinate; in a reference to CUFX, RX is a user X coordinate.

       RY          (an  input  expression  of type REAL) is a Y coordinate in the coordinate system specified by
                   the second letter of the function name.  In a  reference  to  CFUY,  RY  is  a  fractional  Y
                   coordinate; in a reference to CUFY, RY is a user Y coordinate.

       IX  and  IY occur as arguments only in references to some of the obsolete functions; they represent input
       expressions of type INTEGER, specifying the X and Y  coordinates  of  a  point  in  either  PAUs  or  MUs
       (depending on the second letter of the function name).

       The  first  letter  of the function name is a C if the result is of type REAL and a K if the result is of
       type INTEGER (the latter only happens for some of the obsolete ones).  This conforms to the usual FORTRAN
       convention for implicit typing.

       The second letter of the function name specifies the coordinate system of the argument.

       The third letter of the function name specifies the coordinate  system  of  the  functional  result.   In
       references to CFUX and CFUY, the result is in the user system; in references to CUFX and CUFY, the result
       is in the fractional system.

       The  fourth  letter  of  the function name is an X or a Y, depending on whether an X or a Y coordinate is
       being converted.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument description is the same as the FORTRAN argument description.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant examples which use coordinate  converters:  mpex10,
       cbex10, sfex02, epltch.

       The  command  "ncargex -n mpex10" will load the driver mpex10.f into your current working directory where
       you can examine the file using a local editor, or the UNIX more command.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       There were 24 conversion functions in the original set.  These functions (12 for the X  coordinate  of  a
       point,  and  12  for  the  Y  coordinate),  allowed  one to convert between any combination of PAUs, MUs,
       fractional coordinates, and user coordinates.  PAUs and MUs are now obsolete;  thus,  only  four  of  the
       conversion  functions are still pertinent:  CFUX and CFUY allow one to convert the X and Y coordinates of
       a point from the fractional system to the user system, while CUFX and CUFY do the opposite.

       To use any of the conversion routines, load the load the NCAR Graphics libraries  ncarg,  ncarg_gks,  and
       ncarg_c, preferably in that order.
