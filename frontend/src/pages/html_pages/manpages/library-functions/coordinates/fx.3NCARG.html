</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       FX - Given the X and Y coordinates of a point in the grid coordinate system, the function FX returns the
       X coordinate of the point in user coordinate space.

       FY - Given the X and Y coordinates of a point in the grid coordinate system, the function FY returns the
       Y coordinate of the point in user coordinate space.

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       FX and FY are obsolete, and are supported only to provide compatibility with old NCAR Graphics codes.
       These functions are internally callable from four NCAR Graphics utilities -- the Conrec and Conran
       families, and Vectors and Streamlines. Since the Conpack utility has replaced Conrec and Conran for the
       most part, little needs to be said about the use of FX and FY in those utilities.

       For Vectors and Streamlines, however, these routines have been required in order to perform custom
       mappings of the data coordinate space until Version 3.2, when new mapping routine were developed to deal
       more robustly with non-linear transformations of vector components. In order to ease the transition for
       users of the old packages who depend on existing custom mappings using FX and FX, however, both utilities
       have implemented a number of compatibility levels. By modifying the compatibility mode parameter, CPM,
       you can choose to map coordinates either using the old FX and FY routines, or using the new Version 3.2
       routines.

       If you need to create new custom coordinate space mappings, you should use the new mapping methods and
       not use FX and FY, since the internal support for mappings based on these functions is frozen at the
       present level. Any improvements in the code will be directed towards users of the new mapping routines
       only.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       USERX = FX (X,Y)
       USERY = FY (X,Y)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       X           (REAL, input): The X coordinate of a vector location in the grid coordinate system.

       Y           (REAL, input) The Y coordinate of a vector location in the grid coordinate system.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The user does not invoke the functions, FX and FY, directly. Instead the functions are invoked internally
       by  an  NCAR  Graphics  utility  in  order  to convert a position in the grid coordinate system into user
       coordinates. By default, calls to any of the primary entry points for Vectors and  Streamlines  utilities
       that  predate  Version  3.2  (that is, EZVEC, VELVEC, VELVCT, EZSTRM or STRMLN) use FX and FY to map from
       grid to user coordinates. However, by appropriately setting the compatibility mode  parameter,  CPM,  the
       user can choose whether the FX and FY functions or the new mapping routines are invoked when using any of
       the primary entry points, current or obsolete, supported by Vectors and Streamlines.

       Unlike  the  Version  3.2 mapping routines, whose input coordinates are in the data coordinate system, FX
       and FY take input in the grid coordinate system.  Therefore,  any  required  conversions  into  the  data
       coordinate  system  must  be  performed  within  the function prior to the mapping into user coordinates.
       Vectors and Streamlines both provide common blocks (VVMAP and STMAP, respectively) that may  be  included
       by  the  FX  and  FY  functions  to  supply the information necessary to perform the conversion into data
       coordinate space. No pre-defined mappings are supported using FX and FY. The default  versions  of  these
       functions simply perform an identity mapping from grid to user coordinate space.

       When  Vectors  employs FX and FY, it (alone) also requires the use of two other functions, called MXF and
       MYF. Their usage is described below:

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MXF - MXF is a user modifiable function that, given one end point of a vector in both grid  and  metacode
       coordinates, returns the X coordinate of the other end of the vector in metacode coordinates.

       MYF  -  MYF is a user modifiable function that, given one end point of a vector in both grid and metacode
       coordinates, returns the Y coordinate of the other end of the vector in metacode coordinates.

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       Like FX and FY, MXF and MYF are obsolete and should not be employed  when  creating  new  custom  mapping
       code.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       METAX = MXF (X,Y,U,V,SFX,SFY,MX,MY)
       METAY = MYF (X,Y,U,V,SFX,SFY,MX,MY)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       X           (REAL, input): The X coordinate of a vector location in the grid coordinate system.

       Y           (REAL, input) The Y coordinate of a vector location in the grid coordinate system.

       U           (REAL, input) The U component of the vector at the data point specified by arguments X and Y.

       V           (REAL, input) The V component of the vector at the data point specified by arguments X and Y.

       SFX         (REAL,  input)  Scale  factor  used  to  convert the vector magnitude to a length in metacode
                   coordinates.

       SFY         (REAL, input) Scale factor used to convert the vector  magnitude  to  a  length  in  metacode
                   coordinates. In the current implementation this value is the same as the value of SFX.

       MX          (INTEGER, input) X coordinate of the vector location in metacode coordinates.

       MX          (INTEGER, input) Y coordinate of the vector location in metacode coordinates.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  user does not invoke the functions, MXF and MYF, directly.  However, any time the Vectors utility is
       accessed with the compatibility mode parameter set such that the FX and FY routines are used to  map  the
       first endpoint of the vector, the functions MXF and MYF are used to determine the second endpoint.  First
       FX  and FY are invoked to determine the vector location in user coordinates, then this point is converted
       into metacode coordinates; MXF and MYF are passed the coordinates of the point both in grid space and  in
       metacode  space, along with the vector components and a scale factor used to convert the vector magnitude
       into a length in the metacode coordinate system.

       The default version of MXF simply multiplies the U component of the vector (the component parallel to the
       X grid axis) by the scale factor, SFX, and adds it to the X coordinate of the  first  point  in  metacode
       coordinates, MX. MYF uses the same scale factor, SFX, but multiplies by the V component and adds to the Y
       coordinate  in metacode coordinates. These values are respectively returned as the function value by each
       routine. Note that if a mapping is anywhere non-linear, the vector directional angle  may  change  across
       the  transformation,  and an iterative differential technique must be employed to map the second endpoint
       of the vector. When creating a new mapping, the user is strongly urged to use the user-modifiable routine
       VVUMXY, rather than attempting to work with MXF and MYF.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use FX, FY, MXF, and MYF load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.
