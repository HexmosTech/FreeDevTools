</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SPPS - a collection of routines for defining and managing NCAR Graphics coordinate systems, for drawing
       lines, markers, and text in those coordinate systems, and for implementing efficiency considerations such
       as polyline segment buffering.

       The current recognized coordinate systems are GKS world coordinates, GKS normalized device coordinates,
       NCAR Graphics fractional coordinates, and NCAR Graphics user coordinates.  See the NCAR Graphics document
       "The Use of X/Y Coordinates in NCAR Graphics" for descriptions of these coordinate systems.

       The NCAR Graphics user coordinate system allows for axis reversal (mirror imaging) and non-linear
       (logarithmic) axes, which are two important extensions to the GKS world coordinate system.

       Plotter address units (PAUs) were used frequently in various SPPS routine arguments and in some internal
       parameters.   PAUs are not being used in new NCAR Graphics routines.  Wherever they might still be
       encountered, simply interpret them according to the formula "1 PAU = 1/1023 NDC units".

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       OPNGKS - Opens GKS, opens and activates an NCAR GCM workstation (workstation of type 1) with workstation
       ID of 1 and connection ID of 2.

       CLSGKS - Deactivates workstation 1, closes workstation 1, and closes GKS.

       PLOTIF - A line-drawing routine, described in terms of "pen moves".  Most calls to PLOTIF specify whether
       the "pen" should be up (not drawing) or down (drawing) and then move it to a designated position in the
       fractional coordinate system.  The polylines resulting from the pen moves are buffered; some calls to
       PLOTIF just cause the SPPS polyline buffer to be flushed.

       FRSTPT - generates a "pen-up" move to a specified point in the user coordinate system.  FRSTPT is used in
       conjunction with the routine VECTOR to draw lines.

       VECTOR - generates a "pen-down" move to a specified point in the user coordinate system.  VECTOR is used
       in conjunction with the routine FRSTPT to draw lines.

       POINT - draws a point at a specified position in the user coordinate system.

       POINTS - draws a marker at each of a series of specified positions in the user coordinate system.  The
       markers can also be connected by drawing lines between them.

       LINE - draws a line from the point (X1,Y1) to the point (X2,Y2).  The "pen" (for subsequent calls to
       FRSTPT, VECTOR, PLOTIF, and PLOTIT) is left at (X2,Y2).

       CURVE - draws the curve defined by a specified series of points in the user coordinate system.  The "pen"
       (for subsequent calls to FRSTPT, VECTOR, PLOTIF, and PLOTIT) is left at the location of the last point in
       the curve.

       SFLUSH - Flushes polylines, accumulated through calls to the routines PLOTIF and PLOTIT, from the SPPS
       polyline buffer shared by those routines; updates all open workstations; and flushes all system-level I/O
       buffers.

       FRAME - advances to the next picture in the case of CGM output, and pauses in the window of most recent
       creation for X11 output.  A mouse or key click in the window on pause will cause all active workstations
       to be cleared.

       SET - defines the mapping between fractional and user coordinates: sets the values of the SPPS internal
       parameters 'LS' (axis linear/log scaling) and 'MI' (axis mirror imaging); defines GKS normalization
       transformation 1.

       GETSET - returns a set of values which, if used as arguments in a call to SET, will cause normalization
       transformation 1, axis linear/log scaling (internal parameter 'LS'), and axis mirror imaging (internal
       parameter 'MI') to be defined in such a way as to duplicate the combined effects of the current
       normalization transformation, axis scaling, and axis mirror imaging.

       SETUSV - sets the value of one of the internal parameters of SPPS.

       GETUSV - gets the value of one of the internal parameters of SPPS.

       CFUX, CFUY - Converts from fractional coordinates to user coordinates

       CUFX, CUFY - Converts from user coordinates to fractional coordinates
