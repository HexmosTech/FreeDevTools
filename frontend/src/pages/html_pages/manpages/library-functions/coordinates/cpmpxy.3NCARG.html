</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPMPXY - Maps Conpack output from a rectangular coordinate system superimposed on the data grid to some
       other coordinate system.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL CPMPXY (IMAP, XINP, YINP, XOTP, YOTP)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       IMAP        (INTEGER,  input)  is  zero  if  the  object  of  the call is to ask CPMPXY about its mapping
                   capabilities, greater than zero if the object of the call is to do  a  forward  mapping,  and
                   less  than zero if the object of the call is to do an inverse mapping. When IMAP is non-zero,
                   its absolute value matches the current value  of  the  parameter  'MAP'  and  identifies  the
                   mapping to be used.

       XINP        (REAL, input) is used in one of three ways:

                   •   When  IMAP  is  zero, the value INT(XINP) is the index of a mapping about which CPMPXY is
                       being asked to supply information.

                   •   When IMAP is greater than zero, XINP is the X coordinate of a point on the contour  plot.
                       If  'XC1'  =  'XCM' (the default situation), then XINP will lie in the range from 1 to M,
                       where M is the first dimension of the array being contoured (equal to the  value  of  the
                       parameter  'ZDM');  in  this case, the X coordinate will have the same range as the first
                       index of the data array. If the user sets 'XC1' unequal to 'XCM', then XINP will  lie  in
                       the range from 'XC1' (corresponding to an index value of 1) to 'XCM' (corresponding to an
                       index value of M).

                   •   When  IMAP is less than zero, XINP is the X coordinate of a point on the contour plot, in
                       a coordinate system consistent with the current  window,  as  specified  by  arguments  5
                       through 8 of the last call to the SPPS routine SET or by the equivalent call to GKS.

       YINP        (REAL, input/output) is used in one of three ways:

                   •      When  IMAP  is zero, CPMPXY is expected to return one of the following values of YINP:
                          YINP = 0. indicates that  neither  the  forward  nor  the  inverse  transformation  is
                          defined.  YINP  =  1.  indicates  that  the forward transformation is defined, but the
                          inverse is not. YINP = 2. indicates that the forward transformation  is  not  defined,
                          but  the  inverse  is.   YINP  =  3.  indicates  that both the forward and the inverse
                          transformations are defined.

                   •      When IMAP is greater than zero, YINP is the Y coordinate of a  point  on  the  contour
                          plot. If 'YC1' = 'YCN' (the default situation), then YINP will lie in the range from 1
                          to N, where N is the second dimension of the array being contoured (equal to the value
                          of  the  parameter  'ZDN'); in this case, the Y coordinate will have the same range as
                          the second index of the data array. If the user sets 'YC1' unequal to 'YCN', then YINP
                          will lie in the range from 'YC1' (corresponding to an  index  value  of  1)  to  'YCN'
                          (corresponding to an index value of N).

                   •      When  IMAP is less than zero, YINP is the Y coordinate of a point on the contour plot,
                          in a coordinate system consistent with the current window, as specified by arguments 5
                          through 8 of the last call to the SPPS routine SET or by the equivalent call to GKS.

       XOTP and YOTP
                   (REAL, output) are used in one of two ways:

                   •      If IMAP is greater than zero, XOTP and YOTP are the X and Y coordinates of a point  on
                          the  contour  plot,  in  a  coordinate  system  consistent with the current window, as
                          specified by arguments 5 through 8 of the last call to the SPPS routine SET or by  the
                          equivalent call to GKS.

                   •      When  IMAP  is less than zero, XOTP and YOTP are the X and Y coordinates of a point on
                          the contour plot. If 'XC1' = 'XCM' (the default situation), then XOTP will lie in  the
                          range  from 1 to M, where M is the first dimension of the array being contoured (equal
                          to the value of the parameter 'ZDM'); in this case, the X  coordinate  will  have  the
                          same  range  as  the  first index of the data array. If the user sets 'XC1' unequal to
                          'XCM', then XOTP will lie in the range from 'XC1' (corresponding to an index value  of
                          1)  to  'XCM' (corresponding to an index value of M). Similarly, if 'YC1' = 'YCN' (the
                          default situation), then YOTP will lie in the range from 1 to N, where N is the second
                          dimension of the array being contoured (equal to the value of the parameter 'ZDN'); in
                          this case, the Y coordinate will have the same range as the second index of  the  data
                          array.  If  the user sets 'YC1' unequal to 'YCN', then YOTP will lie in the range from
                          'YC1' (corresponding to an index value of 1) to 'YCN' (corresponding to an index value
                          of N).

                          In any case,  if  the  point  (XINP,YINP)  cannot  be  mapped  for  any  reason,  some
                          recognizable  impossible  value  should  be returned for both of XOTP and YOTP and the
                          internal parameter 'ORV' should be given that value, thereby allowing Conpack routines
                          that call CPMPXY to determine whether or not a point being  projected  is  visible  or
                          not.   The  value  used  for  this  purpose by the Ezmap routines MAPTRA and MAPTRI is
                          1.E12.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       CPMPXY is not to be called by the user. It is called by Conpack when the  parameter  'MAP'  is  non-zero.
       Each  call is intended 1) to inquire whether a given mapping is defined by CPMPXY, or 2) to map the X and
       Y coordinates of a single point, whose position  is  known  relative  to  the  data  grid,  to  X  and  Y
       coordinates  in  some  other coordinate system or 3) (as of version 3.1.3) to do the inverse mapping. The
       default version of CPMPXY is as follows:

            SUBROUTINE CPMPXY (IMAP,XINP,YINP,XOTP,YOTP)
              IF (IMAP.EQ.0) THEN
                IF (INT(XINP).GE.1.AND.INT(XINP).LE.3) THEN
                  YINP=3.
                ELSE
                  YINP=0.
                END IF
              ELSE IF (ABS(IMAP).EQ.1) THEN
                IF (IMAP.GT.0) THEN
                  CALL MAPTRA (YINP,XINP,XOTP,YOTP)
                ELSE
                  CALL MAPTRI (XINP,YINP,YOTP,XOTP)
                END IF
              ELSE IF (ABS(IMAP).EQ.2) THEN
                IF (IMAP.GT.0) THEN
                  XOTP=XINP*COS(.017453292519943*YINP)
                  YOTP=XINP*SIN(.017453292519943*YINP)
                ELSE
                  XOTP=SQRT(XINP*XINP+YINP*YINP)
                  YOTP=57.2957795130823*ATAN2(YINP,XINP)
                END IF
              ELSE
                XOTP=XINP
                YOTP=YINP
              END IF
              RETURN
            END

       When CPMPXY is called with IMAP = 0, it assumes it is being
       asked to return information about its mapping capabilities.
       XINP is assumed to have been given the value REAL(I), where
       I is the index of a mapping about which information is
       desired. CPMPXY sets YINP to indicate whether the mapping
       selected by I is implemented or not and whether its inverse
       is implemented or not. In the case of the default version
       of CPMPXY, mappings 1 through 3 are completely implemented
       (both forward and reverse), so a "3." is returned as the
       value of YINP; other mappings are not implemented at all,
       so a "0." is returned as the value of YINP.

       When CPMPXY is called with IMAP = 1, the incoming X and Y
       coordinates are assumed to represent longitude and
       latitude, respectively; the Ezmap routine MAPTRA is called
       to find the X and Y coordinates of the projection of the
       specified point on the globe, and those coordinates are
       returned as the outgoing X and Y coordinates. When IMAP =
       -1, the incoming X and Y coordinates are assumed to be the X
       and Y coordinates of a projected point; the Ezmap routine
       MAPTRI is called to find the longitude and latitude of the
       original point on the globe, and those values are returned
       as the outgoing X and Y coordinates.

       When IMAP = 2, the incoming X and Y coordinates are assumed
       to represent rho and theta (in degrees) in polar
       coordinates; from these are computed the output X and Y
       coordinates. When IMAP = -2, the incoming X and Y
       coordinates are used to compute rho and theta and those
       values are returned.

       If IMAP is anything else, the input X and Y coordinates are
       simply returned as the output X and Y coordinates.

       A user version of CPMPXY can be made to do any desired
       mapping. It should also be made, when IMAP = 0, to return
       correct information about its own capabilities.
