       PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT - PGPLOT enhanced interface for PDL

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        pdl&gt; $x = pdl [1..100]
        pdl&gt; $y = sqrt($x)
        pdl&gt; line $y
        pdl&gt; hold
        Graphics on HOLD
        pdl&gt; $c = sin($x/10)*2 + 4
        pdl&gt; line $c

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT" is a convenience interface to the PGPLOT commands, implemented using the object
       oriented PGPLOT plotting package in PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window. See the documentation for that package
       for in-depth information about the usage of these commands and the options they accept.

       The list of currently availably commands:

        imag       -  Display an image (uses pgimag()/pggray() as appropriate)
        im         -  Shorthand to display an image with aspect ratio of 1
        fits_imag  -  Display a FITS image with appropriate transforms &amp; labels
        cont       -  Display image as contour map
        fits_cont  -  Display a FITS image in scientific coordinates as a contour map
        vect       -  Display 2 images as a vector field
        fits_vect  -  Display 2 FITS images in sci. coordinates as a vector field
        ctab       -  Load an image colour table
        ctab_info  -  Get information about currently loaded colour table
        line       -  Plot vector as connected points
        points     -  Plot vector as points
        errb       -  Plot error bars
        bin        -  Plot vector as histogram (e.g. bin(hist($data)) )
        hi2d       -  Plot image as 2d histogram (not very good IMHO...)
        poly       -  Draw a polygon
        text       -  Write text in the plot area
        label_axes -  Print axis titles
        legend     -  Create a legend with different texts, linestyles etc.
        cursor     -  Interactively read cursor positions.
        circle     -  Draw a circle
        ellipse    -  Draw an ellipse.

       Device manipulation commands:

        hold         -  Hold current plot window range - allows overlays etc.
        release      -  Release back to autoscaling of new plot window for each
                        command
        rel          -  short alias for 'release'
        env          -  Define a plot window, put on 'hold'
        dev          -  Explicitly set a new PGPLOT graphics device
        new_window   -  Create a new plot window (use of dev is recommended)
        focus_window -  Change focus to a new window
        window_list  -  Get a list of currently existing plot windows
        close_window -  Close an open window

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following is a list of the functions that are private to this package, for the other functions please
       read the PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window documentation.

   <b>dev</b>
       Open PGPLOT graphics device

        Usage: dev $device, [$nx,$ny, $opt];

       $device is a PGPLOT graphics device such as "/xserve" or "/ps", if omitted defaults to last used device
       (or value of env var "PGPLOT_DEV" if first time).  $nx, $ny specify sub-panelling. The function returns
       the id of the newly created window - this can subsequently be used as argument to "focus_window" to
       select the window.

       The result of this command can be modified using options. The options recognised are the same as for
       "new_window" - which primarily and in addition it is possible to set the default values for a window that
       are defined in PDL::Graphics::PGPLOTOptions, see this for details but see below for a synopsis.

       In addition "dev" recognises the option "NewWindow" which allows the user to specify that a "dev" command
       is to create a new window rather than closing the previous. This allows a large number of output
       destinations to be open at the same time, which occasionally can be convenient.

       Here is a quick summary of the most useful additional options that can be given:

       Device
           Alternative to $device.

       AspectRatio
           The aspect ratio of the output window

       WindowWidth
           The width of the plot window in inches

       AxisColour
           The axis colour to be used as default for plots in this window. In the same way it is possible to set
           the default character size ("CharSize") and axis and box styles. See PDL::Graphics::PGPLOTOptions for
           details.

       WindowName
           The  name  of  a window. This name can subsequently be used to refer to the window instead of its ID,
           making interactive use somewhat more intuitive.

       To open a X-window output that will stay on screen:

         $win = dev('/xs');

       To open two windows, one small and square, one large and wide:

         $win1 = dev('/xs', {Aspect =&gt; 1, WindowWidth =&gt; 4});
         $win2 = dev('/xs', {Aspect =&gt; 0.5, WindowWidth =&gt; 10});

   <b>new_window</b>
       Open a PGPLOT graphics device

         $win = new_window($dev, $nx, $ny, $opt);

       This function is identical to "dev" except that it always creates a new window. This means that the  user
       is  required  to  close  all windows explicitly using "close_window". All functionality is otherwise like
       "dev" so see the documentation for "dev" for details of use.

   <b>close_window</b>
       Close a PGPLOT output device

        $id = dev($ENV{PGPLOT_DEV});
        points $x, $y; # etc
        close_window($id);

       This function closes a PGPLOT output device created with "dev" or "new_window". It requires the id of the
       window to close. If $id is left undefined,  the  currently  focussed  window  is  deleted  and  focus  is
       transferred  to  the  lowest  numbered window in existence. If many windows have been created and deleted
       this might not be what you expect, so it is recommended to make an explicit call to "focus_window"  after
       any call to "close_window".

       The  $id  will  probably need to have been passed through "dev" (see usage). On X Windows, for "/XSERVE",
       the window won't get closed, but it will with "/XWINDOW".

   <b>_get_windownumber</b>
       Internal function to obtain the ID of a window. This allows the user to refer to a window with its name.

   <b>focus_window</b>
       Switch to another output window.

        Usage: focus_window($id);

       This command is used to switch output focus to another window  created  by  "dev"  or  "new_window".  The
       window can be referred to either by its ID or by its name.

         $win1 = dev('/xs', {WindowName =&gt; 'X-output'});
         $win2 = dev('test.ps/ps', {WindowName =&gt; 'PS-output'});

         focus_window('X-output');  # Or focus_window($win1);
         &lt;.. Commands ..&gt;
         focus_window($win2);       # Or focus_window('PS-output');
         &lt;.. Commands ..&gt;

   <b>window_list</b>
       Return a list of ID numbers and names of the windows currently opened using "dev" or "new_window".

        Usage: ($numbers, $names)=window_list();

       $numbers  and  $names  are  anonymous  arrays  giving  the  ID  numbers  and  names  of  the open windows
       respectively.
