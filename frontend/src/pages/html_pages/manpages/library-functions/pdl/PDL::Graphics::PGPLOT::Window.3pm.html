       PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window - A OO interface to PGPLOT windows

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        pdl&gt; use PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window
        pdl&gt; $win = pgwin(Device =&gt; '/xs');
        pdl&gt; $x = pdl [1..100]
        pdl&gt; $y = sqrt($x)
        pdl&gt; $win-&gt;line($y)
        pdl&gt; $win-&gt;hold()
        pdl&gt; $c = sin($x/10)*2 + 4
        pdl&gt; $win-&gt;line($c)

       In the following documentation the commands are not shown in their OO versions. This is for historical
       reasons and should not cause too much trouble.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package offers a OO interface to the PGPLOT plotting package. This is intended to replace the
       traditional interface in PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT and contains interfaces to a large number of PGPLOT
       routines. Below the usage examples for each function tend to be given in the non-OO version for
       historical reasons. This will slowly be changed, but in the meantime refer to the section on OO-interface
       below to see how to convert the usage information below to OO usage (it is totally trivial).

       PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window is an interface to the PGPLOT graphical libraries.  It currently supports
       PGPLOT-5.2 and PGPLOT-5.2-cd2.  The -cd2 version includes RGB output and anti-aliasing.

       High-level plotting commands:

        imag       -  Display an image (uses pgimag/pggray/pgrgbi as appropriate)
        fits_imag  -  Display a FITS image in scientific coordinates
        cont       -  Display image as contour map
        fits_cont  -  Display a FITS image in scientific coordinates as a contour map
        vect       -  Display 2 images as a vector field
        fits_vect  -  Display 2 FITS images in sci. coordinates as a vector field
        ctab       -  Load an image colour table
        ctab_info  -  Get information about currently loaded colour table
        line       -  Plot vector as connected points
        tline      -  Plot a collection of vectors as lines
        lines      -  Plot a polyline, multicolor vector [broadcastable]
        points     -  Plot vector as points
        tpoints    -  Plot a collection of vectors as points [broadcastable]
        errb       -  Plot error bars
        bin        -  Plot vector as histogram (e.g. bin(hist($data)) )
        hi2d       -  Plot image as 2d histogram (not very good IMHO...)
        tcircle    -  Plot vectors as circles [broadcastable]
        label_axes -  Print axis titles
        legend     -  Create a legend with different texts, linestyles etc.

       Low-level plotting commands:

        arrow      -  Draw an arrow
        poly       -  Draw a polygon
        rectangle  -  Draw a rectangle
        text       -  Write text in the plot area
        cursor     -  Interactively read cursor positions.
        circle     -  Draw a circle
        ellipse    -  Draw an ellipse.

       Device manipulation commands:

        new           -  Construct a new output device
        pgwin         -  Exported hook to new()
        close         -  Close a PGPLOT output device.
        hold          -  Hold current plot window range - allows overlays etc.
        release       -  Release back to freshly autoscaling for each command.
        held          -  Indicates whether the current window is held.
        focus         -  Set focus to the given device.
        erase         -  Erase the current window (or panel).
        options       -  Get the options set for the present output device.
        id            -  The ID for the device.
        device        -  The device type.
        name          -  The window name.

       Notes: $transform for image/cont etc. is used in the same way as the TR() array in the underlying PGPLOT
       FORTRAN routine but is, fortunately, zero-offset. The <b>transform()</b> routine can be used to create this
       ndarray.

       For completeness: The transformation array connect the pixel index to a world coordinate such that:

        X = tr[0] + tr[1]*i + tr[2]*j
        Y = tr[3] + tr[4]*i + tr[5]*j

   <b>Variable</b> <b>passing</b> <b>and</b> <b>extensions</b>
       In general variables are passed to the pgplot routines by using "get_dataref" to get the reference to the
       values. Before passing to pgplot routines however, the data are checked to see if they are in accordance
       with the format (typically dimensionality) required by the PGPLOT routines.  This is done using the
       routine "checkarg" (internal to PGPLOT). This routine checks the dimensionality of the input data. If
       there are superfluous dimensions of size 1 they will be trimmed away until the dimensionality is correct.
       Example:

       Assume an ndarray with dimensions (1,100,1,1) is passed to "line", which expects its inputs to be
       vectors. "checkarg" will then return an ndarray with dimensions (100). If instead the same ndarray was
       passed to "imag", which requires 2D ndarrays as output, "checkarg" would return an ndarray with
       dimensionality (100, 1) (Dimensions are removed from the <u>start</u>)

       Thus, if you want to provide support for another PGPLOT function, the structure currently look like this
       (there are plans to use the Options package to simplify the options parsing):

        # Extract the hash(es) on the commandline
        ($arg, $opt)=_extract_hash(@_);
        &lt;Check the number of input parameters&gt;
        &lt;deal with $arg&gt;
        checkarg($x, 3); # For a hypothetical 3D routine.
        catch_signals {
          ...
          pgcube($n, $x-&gt;get_dataref);
        };
        1;

       (the catch_signals block prevents problems with the perl-PGPLOT interface if the user hits Ctrl-C during
       an operation).

   <b>Setting</b> <b>options</b>
       All routines in this package take a hash with options as an optional input. This options hash can be used
       to set parameters for the subsequent plotting without going via the PGPLOT commands.

       This is implemented such that the plotting settings (such as line width, line style etc.) are affected
       only for that plot, any global changes made, say, with pgslw() are preserved. Some modifications apply
       when using the OO interface, see below.

   <b>Alphabetical</b> <b>listing</b> <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> <b>options</b>
       The following options are always parsed. Whether they have any importance depend on the routine invoked -
       e.g. line style is irrelevant for "imag", or the "justify" option is irrelevant if the display is on
       'hold'.  This is indicated in the help text for the commands below.

       The options are not case sensitive and will match for unique substrings, but this is not encouraged as
       obscure options might invalidate what you thought was a unique substring.

       In the listing below examples are given of each option. The actual option can then be used in a plot
       command by specifying it as an argument to the function wanted (it can be placed anywhere in the command
       list).

       E.g:

        $opt={COLOR=&gt;2};
        line $x, $y, $opt; # This will plot a line with red color

       If you are plotting to a hardcopy device then a number of options use a different name:

         HardLW   instead of LineWidth
         HardCH   instead of CharSize
         HardFont instead of Font

         HardAxisColour instead of AxisColour
         HardColour     instead of Colour

       [although I'm not sure when HardColour is actually used]

       align
           If  "pix"  is set, then images and plots are not stretched to fill the plot area.  the "align" string
           tells how to align them within the available area.  'L' and 'R' shove the plot against the  left  and
           right  edges, respectively; 'B' and 'T' shove the plot against the bottom and top edges.  The default
           is to center the image.  e.g. 'BL' puts the image on the bottom left corner, while 'CT'  centers  the
           image horizontally while placing it at the top of the available plot area.  This defaults to 'BT' for
           non-justified images, to 'CC' for justified images.

       arrow
           This  options allows you to set the arrow shape, and optionally size for arrows for the vect routine.
           The arrow shape is specified as a hash with the key FS to set fill style, ANGLE to  set  the  opening
           angle  of  the  arrow  head,  VENT  to  set how much of the arrow head is cut out and SIZE to set the
           arrowsize.

           The following

            $opt = {ARROW =&gt; {FS=&gt;1, ANGLE=&gt;60, VENT=&gt;0.3, SIZE=&gt;5}};

           will make a broad arrow of five times the normal size.

           Alternatively the arrow can be specified as a set of numbers corresponding to  an  extension  to  the
           syntax for pgsah. The equivalent to the above is

            $opt = {ARROW =&gt; pdl([1, 60, 0.3, 5})};

           For  the latter the arguments must be in the given order, and if any are not given the default values
           of 1, 45, 0.3 and 1.0 respectively will be used.

       arrowsize
           The arrowsize can be specified separately using this option to the options hash. It is useful  if  an
           arrowstyle  has been set up and one wants to plot the same arrow with several sizes. Please note that
           it is <b>not</b> possible to set arrowsize and character size in the same call to a plotting function.  This
           should not be a problem in most cases.

            $opt = {ARROWSIZE =&gt; 2.5};

       axis
           Set  the  axis  value (see "env").  If you pass in a scalar you set the axis for the whole plot.  You
           can also pass in an array ref for finer control of the axes.

           If you set the option to a scalar value, you get one of a few standard layouts.  You can specify them
           by name or by number:

            EMPTY  (-2) draw no box, axes or labels
            BOX    (-1) draw box only
            NORMAL (0)  draw box and label it with coordinates
            AXES   (1)  same as NORMAL, but also draw (X=0,Y=0) axes
            GRID   (2)  same as AXES, but also draw grid lines
            LOGX   (10) draw box and label X-axis logarithmically
            LOGY   (20) draw box and label Y-axis logarithmically
            LOGXY  (30) draw box and label both axes logarithmically

           When using logarithmic axes ("LOGX", "LOGY" and "LOGXY") you normally need to log the data  yourself,
           e.g.

             line $x-&gt;log10, $y, {axis=&gt;'LOGX'};

           For  your  convenience  you  can  put PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT into autolog mode. In this mode a call to
           "line" or "points" will log the data for you and you can pass in the unmodified data, e.g.

             <a href="../man1/autolog.1.html">autolog</a>(1); # enable automatic logarithm calculation
             line $x, $y, {axis=&gt;'LOGX'}; # automatically displays logged x data

           You can use the function interface to enable autologging:

             <a href="../man1/autolog.1.html">autolog</a>(1);

           or use it with a window reference (mode switching on a per window basis)

             $win-&gt;<a href="../man1/autolog.1.html">autolog</a>(1);

           "autolog" without arguments returns the current autolog setting (0=off, 1=on).

           If you set the "AXIS" option to an array ref, then you can specify the  box/axis  options  separately
           for  the  horizontal  (ordinate; X coordinate; 0th element) and vertical (abscissa; Y coordinate; 1st
           element)) axes.  Each element of the array ref should contain a PGPLOT format  string.   Presence  or
           absence of specific characters flags particular options.  For normal numeric labels, the options are:

             A : draw axis for this dimension.
             B : draw bottom (X) or left (Y) edge of frame.
             C : draw top (X) or right (Y) edge of frame.
             G : draw Grid of vertical (X) or horizontal (Y) lines.
             I : Invert ticks: draw them outside the plot rather than inside.
             L : Label the axis Logarithmically.
             P : Extend ("Project") major tick marks outside the box.
             M : Numeric labels go in the alternate place above (X) or to the
                      right (Y) of the viewport.
             N : Numeric labels go in the usual location below (X) or to the
                      left  (Y) of the viewport
             T : Draw major tick marks at the major coordinate interval.
             S : Draw minor tick marks (subticks).
             V : Orient numeric labels Vertically.  Only applicable to Y.
                      (The default is to write them parallel to the axis.)
             1 : Force decimal labelling, instead of automatic choice
             2 : Force exponential labeling, instead of automatic.

           If  you  don't  specify  any  axis  value  at  all,  the  default  is ['BCNST','BCNST'] for plots and
           ['BCINST','BCINST'] for images.  (These list ref elements are handed on  directly  to  the  low-level
           PGPLOT routines).

           In  addition,  you  can  specify that your axis labels should be printed as days, hours, minutes, and
           seconds (ideal for julian dates and delta-t, or for angular quantities).   You  do  that  by  setting
           additional character flags on the affected axis:

             X : Use HH MM SS.S time labeling rather than conventional numeric
                 labels.  The ordinate is in secsonds. Hours roll over at 24.
             Y : Like 'X' but the hour field runs past 24 if necessary.
             Z : Like 'X' but with a days field too (only shown where nonzero).
             H : Label the numbers with superscript d, h, m, and s symbols.
             D : Label the numbers with superscript o, ', and '' symbols.
             F : Omit first (lowest/leftmost) label; useful for tight layouts.
             O : Omit leading zeroes in numbers under 10 (e.g. " 3h 3m 1.2s"
                 rather than "03h 03m 01.2s").

           For  example,  to plot a numeric quantity versus Julian day of the year in a standard boxed plot with
           tick marks, you can use ["BNCSTZHO","BCNST"].

       border
           Normally the limits are chosen so that the plot just fits; with this  option  you  can  increase  (or
           decrease)  the  limits by either a relative (ie a fraction of the original axis width) or an absolute
           amount.  Either specify a hash array, where the keys are "TYPE" (set to 'relative' or 'absolute') and
           "VALUE" (the amount to change the limits by), or set to 1, which is equivalent to

            BORDER =&gt; { TYPE =&gt; 'rel', VALUE =&gt; 0.05 }

       charsize
           Set the character/symbol size as a multiple of the standard size.

            $opt = {CHARSIZE =&gt; 1.5}

           The HardCH option should be used if you are plotting to a hardcopy device.

       colour (or color)
           Set the colour to be used for the subsequent plotting. This can be specified as  a  number,  and  the
           most  used  colours can also be specified with name, according to the following table (note that this
           only works for the default colour map):

             0 - WHITE    1 - BLACK     2 - RED      3 - GREEN    4 - BLUE
             5 - CYAN     6 - MAGENTA   7 - YELLOW   8 - ORANGE  14 - DARKGRAY
            16 - LIGHTGRAY

           However there is a much more flexible mechanism to deal with colour.  The colour can be set as a 3 or
           4 element anonymous array (or ndarray) which gives the RGB colours. If the array  has  four  elements
           the first element is taken to be the colour index to change. For normal work you might want to simply
           use a 3 element array with R, G and B values and let the package deal with the details. The R,G and B
           values go from 0 to 1.

           In  addition the package will also try to interpret non-recognised colour names using the default X11
           lookup table, normally using the "rgb.txt" that came with PGPLOT.

           For more details  on  the  handling  of  colour  it  is  best  that  the  user  consults  the  PGPLOT
           documentation.  Further  details  on the handling of colour can be found in the documentation for the
           internal routine "_set_colour".

           The HardColour option should be used if you are plotting to a hardcopy device [this may be untrue?].

       diraxis
           This sets the direction of the axes of a plot or image, when you don't explicitly set them  with  the
           XRange  and  YRange  options.   It's  particularly  useful  when  you  want (for example) to put long
           wavelengths (larger numbers) on the left hand side of your plot, or when you want to plot an image in
           (RA,dec) coordinates.

           You can use either a scalar or a two-element perl array.  If you set it to 0 (the default)  then  PDL
           will  guess which direction you want to go.  If you set it to a positive number, the axis will always
           increase to the right. If you set it to a negative number, the axis will always increase to the left.

           For example, [0,0] is the default, which is usually right.  [1,1] tells PGPLOT to always increase the
           axis values up and to the right.  For a plot of intensity (y-axis)  versus  wavelength  (x-axis)  you
           could say [-1,1].

           This option is really only useful if you want to allow autoranging but need to set the direction that
           the  axis goes.  If you use the ranging options ("XRange" and "YRange"), you can change the direction
           by changing the order of the maximum and minimum values.  That direction will override "DirAxis".

       filltype
           Set the fill type to be used by "poly", "circle", "ellipse", and "rectangle" The fill can  either  be
           specified using numbers or name, according to the following table, where the recognised name is shown
           in capitals - it is case-insensitive, but the whole name must be specified.

            1 - SOLID
            2 - OUTLINE
            3 - HATCHED
            4 - CROSS_HATCHED

            $opt = {FILLTYPE =&gt; 'SOLID'};

           (see below for an example of hatched fill)

       font
           Set  the  character  font. This can either be specified as a number following the PGPLOT numbering or
           name as follows (name in capitals):

            1 - NORMAL
            2 - ROMAN
            3 - ITALIC
            4 - SCRIPT

           (Note that in a string, the font can be changed using the escape sequences "\fn",  "\fr",  "\fi"  and
           "\fs" respectively)

            $opt = {FONT =&gt; 'ROMAN'};

           gives the same result as

            $opt = {FONT =&gt; 2};

           The HardFont option should be used if you are plotting to a hardcopy device.

       hatching
           Set  the  hatching to be used if either fillstyle 3 or 4 is selected (see above) The specification is
           similar to the one for specifying arrows.  The arguments for the hatching is  either  given  using  a
           hash  with  the  key  ANGLE  to  set  the  angle  that the hatch lines will make with the horizontal,
           SEPARATION to set the spacing of the hatch lines in units of 1% of "min(height, width)" of  the  view
           surface,  and  PHASE  to  set  the  offset the hatching. Alternatively this can be specified as a 1x3
           ndarray "$hatch=pdl[$angle, $sep, $phase]".

            $opt = {FILLTYPE =&gt; 'HATCHED',
                    HATCHING =&gt; {ANGLE=&gt;30, SEPARATION=&gt;4}};

           Can also be specified as

            $opt = {FILL=&gt; 'HATCHED', HATCH =&gt; pdl [30,4,0.0]};

           For another example of hatching, see "poly".

       justify
           If "justify" is set true, then the plot axes are shrunk to fit the plot or image and it specifies the
           aspect ratio of pixel coordinates in the plot or image.  Setting justify=&gt;1 will produce  a  correct-
           aspect-ratio,  shrink-wrapped  image  or plot; setting justify=&gt;0.5 will do the same thing but with a
           short and fat plot.  The difference between "justify" and "pix" is that "pix"  does  not  affect  the
           shape of the axes themselves.

       linestyle
           Set the line style. This can either be specified as a number following the PGPLOT numbering:

            1 - SOLID line
            2 - DASHED
            3 - DOT-DASH-dot-dash
            4 - DOTTED
            5 - DASH-DOT-DOT-dot

           or  using  name (as given in capitals above).  Thus the following two specifications both specify the
           line to be dotted:

            $opt = {LINESTYLE =&gt; 4};
            $varopt = {LINESTYLE =&gt; 'DOTTED'};

           The names are not case sensitive, but the full name is required.

       linewidth
           Set the line width. It is specified as a integer multiple of 0.13 mm.

            $opt = {LINEWIDTH =&gt; 10}; # A rather fat line

           The HardLW option should be used if you are plotting to a hardcopy device.

       pitch
           Sets the number of data pixels per inch on the output device.  You can set the "unit" (see below)  to
           change  this  to any other PGPLOT unit (millimeters, pixels, etc.).   Pitch is device independent, so
           an image should appear exactly the same size (e.g. "Pitch=&gt;100" is  100  dpi)  regardless  of  output
           device.

       pix Sets  the  pixel  aspect  ratio  height/width.   The  height  is adjusted to the correct ratio, while
           maintaining any otherwise-set pitch or scale in the horizontal direction.  Larger numbers yield tall,
           skinny pixels; smaller numbers yield short, fat pixels.

       scale
           Sets the number of output display pixels per data pixel.  You can  set  the  "unit"  (see  below)  to
           change  this  to  number  of  PGPLOT  units  (inches,  millimeters, etc.) per data pixel.  "scale" is
           deprecated, as it is not device-independent; but it does come in handy  for  quick  work  on  digital
           displays,  where  aliasing  might  otherwise  interfere  with  image  interpretation.   For  example,
           "scale=&gt;1" displays images at their native resolution.

       Panel
           It is possible to define multiple plot ``panels'' with in  a  single  window  (see  the  NXPanel  and
           NYPanel  options  in  the constructor).  You can explicitly set in which panel most plotting commands
           occur, by passing either a scalar or an array ref into the "Panel" option.  There  is  also  a  panel
           method, but its use is deprecated because of a wart with the PGPLOT interface.

       plotting &amp; imaging range
           Explicitly  set the plot range in x and y. X-range and Y-range are set separately via the aptly named
           options "XRange" and "YRange". If omitted PGPLOT selects appropriate defaults (minimum and maximum of
           the data range in general). These options are ignored if the window is on hold.

             line $x, $y, {xr =&gt; [0,5]}; # y-range uses default
             line $x, $y, {XRange =&gt; [0,5], YRange =&gt; [-1,3]}; # fully specified range
             imag $im, {XRange =&gt; [30,50], YRange=&gt;[-10,30]};
             fits_imag $im, {XRange=&gt;[-2,2], YRange=&gt;[0,1]};

           Imaging requires some thought if you don't want to lose a pixel off the edge of  the  image.   Pixels
           are  value-centered  (they  are  centered  on  the  coordinate  whose  value  they represent), so the
           appropriate range to plot the entirety of a 100x100 pixel image is "[-0.5,99.5]" on each axis.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT-ORIENTED</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       This section will briefly describe how the  PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window  package  can  be  used  in  an
       object-oriented (OO) approach and what the advantages of this would be. We will start with the latter

       Multiple windows.
           For  the  common  user  it is probably most interesting to use the OO interface when handling several
           open devices at the same time. If you have one  variable  for  each  plot  device  it  is  easier  to
           distribute commands to the right device at the right time. This is the angle we will take in the rest
           of this description.

       Coding and abstraction
           At  a  more  fundamental level it is desirable to approach a situation where it is possible to have a
           generic plotting interface which gives access to several plotting libraries,  much  as  PGPLOT  gives
           access to different output devices. Thus in such a hypothetical package one would say:

             my $win1 = Graphics::new('PGPLOT', {Device =&gt; '/xs'});
             my $win2 = Graphics::new('gnuplot', {Background =&gt; 'Gray'};

           From  a  more  practical  point  of  view such abstraction also comes in handy when you write a large
           program package and you do not want to import routines nilly-willy in which case an OO approach  with
           method calls is a lot cleaner.

           The  pgwin  exported constructor, arguably, breaks this philosophy; hopefully it will ``wither away''
           when other compatible modules are available.

       Anyway, enough philosophizing, let us get down to Earth and give some examples of the use of  OO  PGPLOT.
       As  an example we will take Odd (which happens to be a common Norwegian name) who is monitoring the birth
       of rabbits in O'Fib-o-nachy's farm (alternatively they can  of  course  be  monitoring  processes  or  do
       something  entirely  different).  Odd  wants  the  user  to  be  able to monitor both the birth rates and
       accumulated number of rabbits and the spatial distribution of  the  births.  Since  these  are  logically
       different they choose to have two windows open:

         $rate_win = PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window-&gt;new(Device =&gt; '/xw',
                     Aspect =&gt; 1, WindowWidth =&gt; 5, NXPanel =&gt; 2);

         $area_win = PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window-&gt;new(Device =&gt; '/xw',
                     Aspect =&gt; 1, WindowWidth =&gt; 5);

       See the documentation for "new" below for a full overview of the options you can pass to the constructor.

       Next,  Odd  wants  to  create plotting areas for subsequent plots and maybe show the expected theoretical
       trends

         $rate_win-&gt;env(0, 10, 0, 1000, {XTitle =&gt; 'Days', YTitle =&gt; '#Rabbits'});
         $rate_win-&gt;env(0, 10, 0, 100, {Xtitle=&gt;'Days', Ytitle =&gt; 'Rabbits/day'});

         $area_win-&gt;env(0, 1, 0, 1, {XTitle =&gt; 'Km', Ytitle =&gt; 'Km'});
         # And theoretical prediction.
         $rate_win-&gt;line(<a href="../man10/sequence.10.html">sequence</a>(10), <a href="../man10/fibonacci.10.html">fibonacci</a>(10), {Panel =&gt; [1, 1]});

       That is basically it. The commands should automatically focus the relevant window. Due to the limitations
       of PGPLOT this might however lead you to plot in the wrong panel... The package tries to be smart and  do
       this correctly, but might get it wrong at times.

</pre><h4><b>STATE</b> <b>and</b> <b>RECORDING</b></h4><pre>
       A  new addition to the graphics interface is the ability to record plot commands. This can be useful when
       you create a nice-looking plot on the screen that you want to re-create on paper for instance. Or if  you
       want  to  redo it with slightly changed variables for instance. This is still under development and views
       on the interface are welcome.

       The functionality is somewhat detached from the plotting functions described below so I will discuss them
       and their use here.

       Recording is off by default. To turn it on when you create a new  device  you  can  set  the  "Recording"
       option to true, or you can set the $PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::RECORDING variable to 1. I recommend doing the
       latter  in  your  ".perldlrc"  file at least since you will often have use for recording in the perldl or
       pdl2 script.

   <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b>
       The recording is meant to help you recreate a plot with new data or  to  a  different  device.  The  most
       typical  situation is that you have created a beautiful plot on screen and want to have a Postscript file
       with it. In the dreary old world you needed to go back and execute all commands manually, but  with  this
       wonderful new contraption, the recorder, you can just replay your commands:

         dev '/xs', {Recording =&gt; 1}
         $x = <a href="../man10/sequence.10.html">sequence</a>(10)
         line $x, $x**2, {Linestyle =&gt; 'Dashed'}
         $s = retrieve_state() # Get the current tape out of the recorder.
         dev '/cps'
         replay $s

       This  should  result  in  a  "pgplot.ps"  file with a parabola drawn with a dashed line. Note the command
       "retrieve_state" which retrieves the current state  of  the  recorder  and  return  an  object  (of  type
       PDL::Graphics::State) that is used to replay commands later.

   <b>Controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b>
       Like  any self-respecting recorder you can turn the recorder on and off using the "turn_on_recording" and
       "turn_off_recording" respectively.  Likewise you can clear the state using the "clear_state" command.

         $w=PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window-&gt;new(Device =&gt; '/xs');
         $w-&gt;turn_on_recording;
         $x=<a href="../man10/sequence.10.html">sequence</a>(10); $y=$x*$x;
         $w-&gt;line($x, $y);
         $w-&gt;turn_off_recording;
         $w-&gt;line($y, $x);
         $w-&gt;turn_on_recording;
         $w-&gt;line($x, $y*$x);
         $state = $w-&gt;retrieve_state();

       We can then replay $state and get a parabola and a cubic plot.

         $w-&gt;replay($state);

   <b>Tips</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gotchas!</b>
       The data are stored in the state object as references to the real data. This leads to one  good  and  one
       potentially bad consequence:

       The good is that you can create the plot and then subsequently redo the same plot using a different set
       of data. This is best explained by an example. Let us first create a simple gradient image and get a copy
       of the recording:
             $im = sequence(10,10)
             imag $im
             $s=retrieve_state

           Now  this was a rather dull plot, and in reality we wanted to show an image using "rvals". Instead of
           re-creating the plot (which of course here would be the simplest option) we just change $im:

             $im -= sequence(10,10)
             $im += rvals(10,10)

           Now replay the commands

             replay $s

           And hey presto! A totally different  plot.  Note  however  the  trickery  required  to  avoid  losing
           reference to $im

       This takes us immediately to the major problem with the recording though. Memory leakage! Since the
       recording keeps references to the data it can keep data from being freed (zero reference count) when you
       expect it to be. For instance, in this example, we lose totally track of the original $im variable, but
       since there is a reference to it in the state it will not be freed
             $im = sequence(1000,1000)
             imag $im
             $s = retrieve_state
             $im = rvals(10,10)

           Thus after the execution of these commands we still have a reference to a 1000x1000 array which takes
           up a lot of memory...

           The solution is to call "clear" on the state variable:

             $s-&gt;clear()

           (This  is  done automatically if the variable goes out of scope). I forsee this problem to most acute
           when working on the "perldl" or "pdl2" command line, but since this is exactly where the recording is
           most useful the best advice is just to be careful and call clear on state variables.

           If you are working with scripts and use large images for instance I would instead recommend that  you
           do not turn on recording unless you need it.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A  more  detailed  listing  of  the functions and their usage follows. For all functions we specify which
       options take effect and what other options exist for the given function. The function descriptions  below
       are  all  given  for the non-OO usage for historical reasons, but since the conversion to an OO method is
       trivial there is no major need for concern. Whenever you see a function example of the form

         Usage: a_simple_function($x, $y, $z [, $opt]);

       and you wish to use the OO version, just let your mind read the above line as:

         Usage: $win-&gt;a_simple_function($x, $y, $z [, $opt]);

       where $win is a PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window object. That is all.

   <b>Window</b> <b>control</b> <b>functions.</b>
   <b>pgwin</b>
       Exported constructor for PGPLOT object/device/plot window.

        Usage: pgwin($opt);
        Usage: pgwin($option=&gt;$value,...);
        Usage: pgwin($device);

       Parameters are passed on to <b>new()</b> and can either be specified by hash reference or as a list.

       See the documentation fo PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window::new for details.

       Because pgwin is a convenience function, you can specify the  device  by  passing  in  a  single  non-ref
       parameter.  For even further convenience, you can even omit the '/' in the device specifier, so these two
       lines deliver the same result:

           $win = pgwin(gif);
           $win = PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window-&gt;new({Dev=&gt;'/gif'});

   <b>new</b>
       Constructor for PGPLOT object/device/plot window.

         Usage: PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window-&gt;new($opt);
         Usage: PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window-&gt;new($option=&gt;$value,...);

       Options to <b>new()</b> can either be specified via a reference to a hash

         $win = PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window-&gt;new({Dev=&gt;'/xserve',ny=&gt;2});

       or directly, as an array

         # NOTE: no more {} !
         $win = PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window-&gt;new(Dev=&gt;'/xserve',ny=&gt;2);

       The following lists the recognised options:

       AspectRatio
           The aspect ratio of the image, in the sense vertical/horizontal.  See the discussion on size setting.

       Device
           The type of device to use. The syntax of this is the one used by PGPLOT.

       Hold
           Hold  the  plot  window  so that subsequent plots can plot over existing plots.  This can be adjusted
           with the hold() and release() methods.

       NXPanel
           The number of panels in the X-direction

       NYPanel
           The number of panels in the Y-direction

       Size
           Yet another way to identify the plot window size -- this takes a scalar or an  array  ref  containing
           one,  two,  or  three  numbers.   One  number gives you a square window.  Two gives you a rectangular
           window "(X,Y)".   Three  lets  you  specify  the  unit  compactly  (e.g.  "[&lt;X&gt;,&lt;Y&gt;,1]"  for  inches,
           "[&lt;X&gt;,&lt;Y&gt;,2]"  for  mm) but is deprecated in favor of using the "Unit" option.  See the discussion on
           size setting.

       Unit
           The unit to use for size setting.  PGPLOT accepts inch, mm, or pixel.  The default unit is inches for
           historical reasons, but you can choose millimeters or (God forbid) pixels as well.  String or numeric
           specifications are OK (0=normalized, 1=inches, 2=mm, 3=pixels).  Normalized units make no sense  here
           and  are  not accepted.  Ideally someone will one day hook this into the CPAN units parser so you can
           specify window size in rods or attoparsecs.

       WindowName
           The name to give to the window. No particular use is made of this at present.  It would be  great  if
           it was possible to change the title of the window frame.

       WindowWidth
           The width of the window in inches (or the specified Unit).  See the discussion on size setting.

       WindowXSize and WindowYSize
           The  width  and  height  of the window in inches (or the specified Unit).  See the discussion on size
           setting.

       An important point to note is that the default values of most options can be specified by  passing  these
       to  the constructor. All general options (common to several functions) can be adjusted in such a way, but
       function specific options can not be set in this way (this is a design limitation which is unlikely to be
       changed).

       Thus the following call will set up a window where the default axis colour will be yellow and where  plot
       lines normally have red colour and dashed linestyle.

         $win = PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window-&gt;new(Device =&gt; '/xs',
                 AxisColour =&gt; 'Yellow', Colour =&gt; 'Red', LineStyle =&gt; 'Dashed');

       Size  setting:  There are a gazillion ways to set window size, in keeping with TIMTOWTDI.  In general you
       can get away with passing any unique combination of an "&lt;X&gt;" size, a "&lt;Y&gt;"size, and/or an  aspect  ratio.
       In   increasing   order   of   precedence,  the  options  are:  ("Units",  "AspectRatio",  "WindowWidth",
       "Window&lt;X,Y&gt;Size", "Size").

       So if you specify an AspectRatio *and* an X and a Y coordinate, the AspectRatio is ignored.  Likewise, if
       you specify Units and a three-component Size, the Units option is ignored in favor of the numeric unit in
       the Size.

       If you don't specify enough information to set the size of the window, you get the default pane size  and
       shape for that device.

   <b>close</b>
       Close a plot window

         Usage: $win-&gt;close()

       Close the current window. This does not necessarily mean that the window is removed from your screen, but
       it does ensure that the device is closed. E.g., on X Windows with "/XSERVE", the window won't get closed,
       but it will with "/XWINDOW".

       A  message  will  be  printed  to  STDOUT  giving  the name of the file created if the plot was made to a
       hardcopy device and $PDL::verbose is true.

   <b>held</b>
       Check if a window is on hold

         $is_held = $win-&gt;held();

       Function to check whether the window is held or not.

   <b>hold</b>
       Hold the present window.

        Usage: $win-&gt;hold()

       Holds the present window so that subsequent plot commands overplots.

   <b>panel</b>
       Switch to a different panel

         $win-&gt;panel(&lt;num&gt;);

       Move to a different panel on the plotting surface. Note that you will need to erase it manually  if  that
       is what you require.

       This  routine currently does something you probably don't want, and hence is deprecated for most use:  if
       you say

         $win-&gt;<a href="../man1/panel.1.html">panel</a>(1);
         $win-&gt;imag($image);

       then $image will actually be displayed in panel <b>2</b>.  That's because the main  plotting  routines  such  as
       line  and imag all advance the panel when necessary.  Instead, it's better to use the Panel option within
       plotting commands, if you want to set the panel explicitly.

   <b>release</b>
       Release a plot window.

          $win-&gt;release()

       Release a plot window so that subsequent plot commands move to the next  panel  or  erase  the  plot  and
       create a new plot.

   <b>erase</b>
       Erase plot

         $win-&gt;erase($opt);

       Erase  a  plot  area.  This accepts the option "Panel" or alternatively a number or array reference which
       makes it possible to specify the panel to erase when working with several panels.

   <b>Plotting</b> <b>functions</b>
   <b>env</b>
       Define a plot window, and put graphics on 'hold'

        $win-&gt;env( $xmin, $xmax, $ymin, $ymax, [$justify, $axis] );
        $win-&gt;env( $xmin, $xmax, $ymin, $ymax, [$options] );

       $xmin, $xmax, $ymin, $ymax are the plot boundaries.  $justify is a boolean value (default is <b>0</b>); if  true
       the  axes  scales  will  be  the same (see "justify").  $axis describes how the axes should be drawn (see
       "axis") and defaults to <b>0</b>.

       If the second form is used, $justify and $axis can be set in the options hash, for example:

        $win-&gt;env( 0, 100, 0, 50, {JUSTIFY =&gt; 1, AXIS =&gt; 'GRID',
                                   CHARSIZE =&gt; 0.7} );

       In addition the following options can also be set for "env":

       PlotPosition
           The position of the plot on the page relative to the view surface in  normalised  coordinates  as  an
           anonymous  array.  The array should contain the lower and upper X-limits and then the lower and upper
           Y-limits. To place two plots above each other with no space between them you could do

             $win-&gt;env(0, 1, 0, 1, {PlotPosition =&gt; [0.1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.5]});
             $win-&gt;env(5, 9, 0, 8, {PlotPosition =&gt; [0.1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.9]});

       Axis, Justify, Border
           See the description of general options for these options.

       AxisColour
           Set the colour of the coordinate axes.

       XTitle, YTitle, Title, Font, CharSize
           Axes titles and the font and size to print them.

   <b>label_axes</b>
       Label plot axes

         $win-&gt;label_axes(&lt;xtitle&gt;, &lt;ytitle&gt;, &lt;plot title&gt;, $options);

       Draw labels for each axis on a plot.

   <b>imag</b>
       Display an image (uses pgimag()/pggray() as appropriate)

        $win-&gt;imag ( $image,  [$min, $max, $transform], [$opt] )

       NOTES

       $transform for image/cont etc. is used in the same way as the TR() array in the underlying PGPLOT FORTRAN
       routine but is, fortunately, zero-offset. The <b>transform()</b> routine can be used to create this ndarray.

       If $image is two-dimensional, you get a grey or pseudocolor image using the scalar  values  at  each  X,Y
       point.   If $image is three-dimensional and the third dimension has order 3, then it is treated as an RGB
       true-color image via "rgbi".

       There are several options related to scaling.  By default, the image is scaled to fit the PGPLOT  default
       viewport  on  the screen.  Scaling, aspect ratio preservation, and 1:1 pixel mapping are available.  (1:1
       pixel mapping is useful for avoiding display artifacts, but it's not recommended for final output as it's
       not device-independent.)

       Here's an additional complication: the "pixel" stuff refers not (necessarily) to normal image pixels, but
       rather to <u>transformed</u> image pixels.  That is  to  say,  if  you  feed  in  a  transform  matrix  via  the
       "TRANSFORM"  option,  the  "PIX",  "SCALE", etc. options all refer to the transformed coordinates and not
       physical image pixels.  That is a Good Thing because it, e.g., lets you  specify  plate  scales  of  your
       output  plots  directly!   See  fits_imag  for an example application.  If you do not feed in a transform
       matrix, then the identity matrix is applied so that the scaling options refer to original data pixels.

       To draw a colour bar (or wedge), either use the "DrawWedge" option, or the draw_wedge() routine (once the
       image has been drawn).

       Options recognised:

       ITF
          the image transfer function applied to the pixel values.  It may be one  of  'LINEAR',  'LOG',  'SQRT'
          (lower case is acceptable). It defaults to 'LINEAR'.

       MIN
          Sets the minimum value to be used for calculation of the color-table stretch.

       MAX
          Sets the maximum value for the same.

       RANGE
          A  more  compact way to specify MIN and MAX, as a list: you can say "Range=&gt;[0,10]" to scale the color
          table for brightness values between 0 and 10 in the image data.

       CRANGE
          Image values between MIN and MAX are scaled to an interval in normalized color domain  space,  on  the
          interval  [0,1],  before  lookup  in  the window's color table. CRANGE lets you use only a part of the
          color table by specifying your own range -- e.g. if you say "CRange=&gt;[0.25,0.75]" then only the middle
          half of the pseudocolor space will be used.  (See the writeup on <b>ctab()</b>.)

       TRANSFORM
          The PGPLOT transform 'matrix' as a 6x1 vector for display

       DrawWedge
          set to 1 to draw a colour bar (default is 0)

       Wedge
          see the <b>draw_wedge()</b> routine

       The following standard options influence this command:

        AXIS, BORDER, JUSTIFY, SCALE, PIX, PITCH, ALIGN, XRANGE, YRANGE

          To see an image with maximum size in the current window, but square
          pixels, say:
                $win-&gt;imag( $x, { PIX=&gt;1 } );
          An alternative approach is to try:
                $win-&gt;imag( $x, { JUSTIFY=&gt;1 } );
          To see the same image, scaled 1:1 with device pixels, say:
                $win-&gt;imag( $x, { SCALE=&gt;1 } );
          To see an image made on a device with 1:2 pixel aspect ratio, with
          X pixels the same as original image pixels, say
                $win-&gt;imag( $x, { PIX=&gt;0.5, SCALE=&gt;2 } );
          To display an image at 100 dpi on any device, say:
                $win-&gt;imag( $x, { PITCH=&gt;100 } );
          To display an image with 100 micron pixels, say:
                $win-&gt;imag( $x, { PITCH=&gt;10, UNIT=&gt;'mm' } );

   <b>imag1</b>
       Display an image with correct aspect ratio

        $win-&gt;imag1 ( $image, [$min, $max, $transform], [$opt] )

       This is syntactic sugar for

         $win-&gt;imag( { PIX=&gt;1, ALIGN=&gt;'CC' } );

   <b>rgbi</b>
       Display an RGB color image

       The calling sequence is exactly like "imag", except that the input image must have three dimensions: "N x
       M x 3".  The last dimension is the (R,G,B) color value.  This routine requires <b>pgplot</b> <b>5.3devel</b> or  later.
       Calling  rgbi explicitly is not necessary, as calling image with an appropriately dimensioned RGB triplet
       makes it fall through to rgbi.

   <b>fits_imag</b>
       Display a FITS image with correct axes

         $win-&gt;fits_imag( image,  [$min, $max], [$opt] );

       NOTES

       Titles:
          Currently fits_imag also generates titles for you by default and appends the  FITS  header  scientific
          units if they're present.  So if you say

            $pdl-&gt;hdr-&gt;{CTYPE1} = "Flamziness";
            $pdl-&gt;hdr-&gt;{CUNIT1} = "milliBleems";
            $win-&gt;fits_imag($pdl);

          then  you  get  an  X  title  of "Flamziness (milliBleems)".  But you can (of course) override that by
          specifying the XTitle and YTitle switches:

            $win-&gt;fits_imag($pdl,{Xtitle=&gt;"Arbitrary"});

          will give you "Arbitrary" as an X axis title, regardless of what's in the header.

       Scaling and aspect ratio:
          If CUNIT1 and CUNIT2 (or, if they're missing, CTYPE1 and CTYPE2) agree, then the default pixel  aspect
          ratio  is  1  (in  scientific units, NOT in original pixels).  If they don't agree (as for a spectrum)
          then the default pixel aspect ratio is adjusted automatically to match the  plot  viewport  and  other
          options you've specified.

          You  can  override  the  image  scaling using the SCALE, PIX, or PITCH options just as with the <b>imag()</b>
          method -- but those parameters refer to the scientific coordinate system  rather  than  to  the  pixel
          coordinate  system  (e.g.  "PITCH=&gt;100" means "100 scientific units per inch", and "SCALE=&gt;1" means "1
          scientific unit per device pixel").  See the <b>imag()</b> writeup for more info on these options.

          The default value of  the  "ALIGN"  option  is  'CC'  --  centering  the  image  both  vertically  and
          horizontally.

       Axis direction:
          By  default,  fits_imag  tries  to  guess  which direction your axes are meant to go (left-to-right or
          right-to-left) using the CDELT keywords: if "CDELT" is negative, then rather than reflecting the image
          fits_imag will plot the X axis so that the highest values are on the left.

          This is the most convenient behavior  for  folks  who  use  calibrated  (RA,DEC)  images,  but  it  is
          technically  incorrect.   To  force  the  direction,  use  the  DirAxis  option.  Setting "DirAxis=&gt;1"
          (abbreviated "di=&gt;1") will force the scientific axes to increase to the right, reversing the image  as
          necessary.

       Color wedge:
          By  default  fits_imag draws a color wedge on the right; you can explicitly set the "DrawWedge" option
          to 0 to avoid this.  Use the "WTitle" option to set the wedge title.

       Alternate WCS coordinates:
          The default behaviour is to use the primary/default WCS information  in  the  FITS  header  (i.e.  the
          "CRVAL1","CRPIX1",...        keywords).        The        Greisen        et        al.        standard
          (&lt;<a href="http://fits.cv.nrao.edu/documents/wcs/wcs.html">http://fits.cv.nrao.edu/documents/wcs/wcs.html</a>&gt;)  allows  alternative/additional  mappings   to   be
          included  in  a  header;  these  are  denoted  by  the letters "A" to "Z". If you know that your image
          contains such a mapping then you can use the "WCS"  option  to  select  the  appropriate  letter.  For
          example,  if you had read in a Chandra image created by the CIAO software package then you can display
          the image in the "physical" coordinate system by saying:

            $win-&gt;fits_imag( $pdl, { wcs =&gt; 'p' } );

          The identity transform is used if you select a mapping for  which  there  is  no  information  in  the
          header.  Please note that this support is <b>experimental</b> and is not guaranteed to work correctly; please
          see the documentation for the "_FITS_tr" routine for more information.

   <b>fits_rgbi</b>
       Display an RGB FITS image with correct axes

         $win-&gt;fits_rgbi( image, [$min,$max], [$opt] );

       Works  exactly like "fits_imag", but the image must be in (X,Y,RGB) form.  Only the first two axes of the
       FITS header are examined.

   <b>fits_cont</b>
       Draw contours of an image, labelling the axes using the WCS information in the FITS header of the image.

         $win-&gt;fits_cont( image, [$contours, $transform, $misval], [$opt] )

       Does the same thing for the "cont" routine that "fits_imag" does for the "imag" routines.

   <b>draw_wedge</b>
       Add a wedge (colour bar) to an image.

        $win-&gt;draw_wedge( [$opt] )

       Adds a wedge - shows the mapping between colour and value for a pixel - to the current image.   This  can
       also be achieved by setting "DrawWedge" to 1 when calling the "imag" routine.

       The colour and font size are the same as used to draw the image axes (although this will probably fail if
       you did it yourself).  To control the size and location of the wedge, use the "Wedge" option, giving it a
       hash reference containing any of the following:

       Side
           Which side of the image to draw the wedge: can be one of 'B', 'L', 'T', or 'R'. Default is <b>'R'</b>.

       Displacement
           How  far  from  the  edge of the image should the wedge be drawn, in units of character size. To draw
           within the image use a negative value. Default is <b>1.5</b>.

       Width
           How wide should the wedge be, in units of character size.  Default is <b>2</b>.

       Label
           A text label to be added to the wedge.  If set, it is probably worth increasing the "Width" value  by
           about  1  to  keep  the  text readable.  Default is <b>''</b>.  This is equivalent to the "WTitle" option to
           "imag", "fits_imag", and similar methods.

       ForeGround (synonym Fg)
           The pixel value corresponding to the "maximum" colour.  If "undef", uses the  value  used  by  "imag"
           (recommended choice).  Default is "undef".

       BackGround (synonym Bg)
           The  pixel  value  corresponding  to the "minimum" colour.  If "undef", uses the value used by "imag"
           (recommended choice).  Default is "undef".

        $x = rvals(50,50);
        $win = PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window-&gt;new();
        $win-&gt;imag( $x, { Justify =&gt; 1, ITF =&gt; 'sqrt' } );
        $win-&gt;draw_wedge( { Wedge =&gt; { Width =&gt; 4, Label =&gt; 'foo' } } );
        # although the following might be more sensible
        $win-&gt;imag( $x, { Justify =&gt; 1, ITF =&gt; 'sqrt', DrawWedge =&gt; 1,
            Wedge =&gt; { Width =&gt; 4, Label =&gt; 'foo'} } );

   <b>ctab</b>
       Load an image colour table.

        Usage:

          ctab ( $name, [$contrast, $brightness] ) # Builtin col table
          ctab ( $ctab, [$contrast, $brightness] ) # $ctab is Nx4 array
          ctab ( $levels, $red, $green, $blue, [$contrast, $brightness] )
          ctab ( '', $contrast, $brightness ) # use last color table

       Note: See PDL::Graphics::LUT for access to a large number of colour tables.

       Notionally, all non-RGB images and vectors have their colors looked  up  in  the  window's  color  table.
       Colors  in  images  and such are scaled to a normalized pseudocolor domain on the line segment [0,1]; the
       color table is a piecewise linear function that maps this one-dimensional scale to the  three-dimensional
       normalized RGB color space [0,1]^3.

       You  can  specify specific indexed colors by appropriate use of the (levels,red,green,blue) syntax -- but
       that is deprecated, since the actual available number of  colors  can  change  depending  on  the  output
       device.  (Someone needs to write a specific hardware-dependent lookup table interface).

       See also "imag" for a description of how to use only part of the color table for a particular image.

   <b>ctab_info</b>
       Return information about the currently loaded color table

   <b>autolog</b>
       Turn on automatic logarithmic scaling in "line" and "points"

         Usage:  autolog([0|1]);

       Setting  the  argument to 1 turns on automatic log scaling and setting it to zero turns it off again. The
       function can be used in both the  object  oriented  and  standard  interface.  To  learn  more,  see  the
       documentation for the axis option.

          my $win = PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window-&gt;new(dev=&gt;'/xserve');
          my $x=<a href="../man10/sequence.10.html">sequence</a>(10);
          my $y=$x*$x+1;

          $win-&gt;<a href="../man1/autolog.1.html">autolog</a>(1);
          $win-&gt;line($x,$y, {Axis =&gt; 'LogY'});

   <b>line</b>
       Plot vector as connected points

       If  the 'MISSING' option is specified, those points in the $y vector which are equal to the MISSING value
       are not plotted, but are skipped over.  This allows one to quickly draw multiple lines with one  call  to
       "line", for example to draw coastlines for maps.

        Usage: line ( [$x,] $y, [$opt] )

       The following standard options influence this command:

        AXIS, BORDER, COLO(U)R, LINESTYLE, LINEWIDTH, MISSING,
        JUSTIFY, SCALE, PITCH, PIX, ALIGN

        $x = <a href="../man10/sequence.10.html">sequence</a>(10)/10.;
        $y = sin($x)**2;
        # Draw a red dot-dashed line
        line $x, $y, {COLOR =&gt; 'RED', LINESTYLE=&gt;3};

   <b>lines</b>
       Plot a list of vectors as discrete sets of connected points

       This  works  much  like  "line",  but for discrete sets of connected points.  There are two ways to break
       lines: you can pass in x/y coordinates just like in "line", but with an  additional  "pen"  ndarray  that
       indicates  whether  the pen is up or down on the line segment following each point (so you set it to zero
       at the end of each line segment you want to draw);  or you can pass in an array ref containing a list  of
       single polylines to draw.

       Happily, there's extra meaning packed into the "pen" ndarray: it multiplies the COLO(U)R that you set, so
       if  you  feed  in boolean values you get what you expect -- but you can also feed in integer or floating-
       point values to get multicolored lines.

       Furthermore, the sign bit of "pen" can be used to draw hairline segments: if "pen" is negative, then  the
       segment is drawn as though it were positive but with LineWidth and HardLW set to 1 (the minimum).

       Equally happily, even if you are using the array ref mechanism to break your polylines you can feed in an
       array ref of "pen" values to take advantage of the color functionality or further dice your polylines.

       Note  that,  unlike  "line",  "lines"  has no no specify-$y-only calling path.  That's because "lines" is
       intended more for line art than for plotting, so you always have to specify both $x and $y.

       Infinite or bad values are ignored -- that is to say, if your vector contains a  non-finite  point,  that
       point breaks the vector just as if you set pen=0 for both that point and the point before it.

        Usage: $w-&gt;lines( $x, $y, [$pen], [$opt] );
               $w-&gt;lines( $xy, [$pen], [$opt] );
               $w-&gt;lines( \@xvects, \@yvects, [\@pen], [$opt] );
               $w-&gt;lines( \@xyvects, [\@pen], [$opt] );

       The following standard options influence this command:
        AXIS, BORDER, COLO(U)R, LINESTYLE, LINEWIDTH, MISSING,
        JUSTIFY, SCALE, PITCH, PIX, ALIGN

       CAVEAT:

       Setting  "pen" elements to 0 prevents drawing altogether, so you can't use that to draw in the background
       color.

   <b>points</b>
       Plot vector as points

        Usage: points ( [$x,] $y, [$symbol(s)], [$opt] )

       Options recognised:

          SYMBOL - Either an ndarray with the same dimensions as $x, containing
                   the symbol associated to each point or a number specifying
                   the symbol to use for every point, or a name specifying the
                   symbol to use according to the following (recognised name in
                    capital letters):
                    0 - SQUARE   1 - DOT     2 - PLUS     3 - ASTERISK
                    4 - CIRCLE   5 - CROSS   7 - TRIANGLE 8 - EARTH
                    9 - SUN     11 - DIAMOND 12- STAR
        PLOTLINE - If this is &gt;0 a line will be drawn through the points.

       The following standard options influence this command:

        AXIS, BORDER, CHARSIZE, COLOUR, LINESTYLE, LINEWIDTH,
        JUSTIFY, SCALE, PIX, PITCH, ALIGN

       "SymbolSize" allows adjusting the symbol size, it defaults to CharSize.

       The "ColorValues" option allows one to plot XYZ data with the Z  axis  mapped  to  a  color  value.   For
       example:

        use PDL::Graphics::LUT;
        ctab(lut_data('idl5')); # set up color palette to 'idl5'
        points ($x, $y, {ColorValues =&gt; $z});

        $y = <a href="../man10/sequence.10.html">sequence</a>(10)**2+<a href="../man10/random.10.html">random</a>(10);
        # Plot blue stars with a solid line through:
        points $y, {PLOTLINE =&gt; 1, COLOUR =&gt; BLUE, symbol =&gt; STAR}; # case insensitive

   <b>errb</b>
       Plot error bars (using pgerrb())

       Usage:

        errb ( $y, $yerrors, [$opt] )
        errb ( $x, $y, $yerrors, [$opt] )
        errb ( $x, $y, $xerrors, $yerrors, [$opt] )
        errb ( $x, $y, $xloerr, $xhierr, $yloerr, $yhierr, [$opt])

       Any of the error bar parameters may be "undef" to omit those error bars.

       Options recognised:

          TERM - Length of terminals in multiples of the default length
        SYMBOL - Plot the datapoints using the symbol value given, either
                 as name or number - see documentation for 'points'

       The following standard options influence this command:

        AXIS, BORDER, CHARSIZE, COLOUR, LINESTYLE, LINEWIDTH,
        JUSTIFY, SCALE, PIX, PITCH, ALIGN

        $y = <a href="../man10/sequence.10.html">sequence</a>(10)**2+<a href="../man10/random.10.html">random</a>(10);
        $sigma=0.5*sqrt($y);
        errb $y, $sigma, {COLOUR =&gt; RED, SYMBOL =&gt; 18};

        # plot X bars only
        errb( $x, $y, $xerrors, undef );

        # plot negative going bars only
        errb( $x, $y, $xloerr, undef, $yloerr, undef );

   <b>cont</b>
       Display image as contour map

        Usage: cont ( $image,  [$contours, $transform, $misval], [$opt] )

       Notes:  $transform for image/cont etc. is used in the same way as the TR() array in the underlying PGPLOT
       FORTRAN routine but is, fortunately, zero-offset. The <b>transform()</b> routine can  be  used  to  create  this
       ndarray.

       Options recognised:

           CONTOURS - A ndarray with the contour levels
             FOLLOW - Follow the contour lines around (uses pgcont rather than
                      pgcons) If this is set &gt;0 the chosen linestyle will be
                      ignored and solid line used for the positive contours
                      and dashed line for the negative contours.
             LABELS - An array of strings with labels for each contour
        LABELCOLOUR - The colour of labels if different from the draw colour
                      This will not interfere with the setting of draw colour
                      using the colour keyword.
            MISSING - The value to ignore for contouring
          NCONTOURS - The number of contours wanted for automatical creation,
                      overridden by CONTOURS
          TRANSFORM - The pixel-to-world coordinate transform vector

       The following standard options influence this command:

        AXIS, BORDER, COLOUR, LINESTYLE, LINEWIDTH,
        JUSTIFY, SCALE, PIX, PITCH, ALIGN

        $x=sequence(10,10);
        $ncont = 4;
        $labels= ['COLD', 'COLDER', 'FREEZING', 'NORWAY']
        # This will give four blue contour lines labelled in red.
        cont $x, {NCONT =&gt; $ncont, LABELS =&gt; $labels, LABELCOLOR =&gt; RED,
                  COLOR =&gt; BLUE}

   <b>bin</b>
       Plot vector as histogram (e.g. "bin(hist($data))")

        Usage: bin ( [$x,] $data )

       Options recognised:

        CENTRE - (default=1) if true, the x values denote the centre of the
                 bin otherwise they give the lower-edge (in x) of the bin
        CENTER - as CENTRE

       The following standard options influence this command:

        AXIS, BORDER, COLOUR, JUSTIFY, LINESTYLE, LINEWIDTH

   <b>hi2d</b>
       Plot image as 2d histogram (not very good IMHO...)

        Usage: hi2d ( $image, [$x, $ioff, $bias], [$opt] )

       Options recognised:

        IOFFSET - The offset for each array slice. &gt;0 slants to the right
                                                   &lt;0 to the left.
           BIAS - The bias to shift each array slice up by.

       The following standard options influence this command:

        AXIS, BORDER, JUSTIFY, SCALE, PIX, PITCH, ALIGN

       Note  that meddling with the "ioffset" and "bias" often will require you to change the default plot range
       somewhat. It is also worth noting that if you have TriD working you will probably  be  better  off  using
       mesh3d or a similar command - see the PDL::Graphics::TriD module.

        $r=<a href="../man100/sequence.100.html">sequence</a>(100)/50-1.0;
        $y=exp(-$r**2)*transpose(exp(-$r**2))
        hi2d $y, {IOFF =&gt; 1.5, BIAS =&gt; 0.07};

   <b>arrow</b>
       Plot an arrow

        Usage: arrow($x1, $y1, $x2, $y2, [, $opt]);

       Plot an arrow from "$x1, $y1" to "$x2, $y2". The arrow shape can be set using the option "Arrow". See the
       documentation for general options for details about this option (and the example below):

       Example:

         arrow(0, 1, 1, 2, {Arrow =&gt; {FS =&gt; 1, Angle =&gt; 1, Vent =&gt; 0.3, Size =&gt; 5}});

       which draws a broad, large arrow from (0, 1) to (1, 2).

   <b>rect</b>
       Draw a non-rotated rectangle

       Usage: rect ( $x1, $x2, $y1, $y2 )

       Options recognised:

       The following standard options influence this command:

        AXIS, BORDER, COLOUR, FILLTYPE, HATCHING, LINESTYLE,  LINEWIDTH
        JUSTIFY, SCALE, PIX, PITCH, ALIGN

   <b>poly</b>
       Draw a polygon

        Usage: poly ( $x, $y )

       Options recognised:

       The following standard options influence this command:

        AXIS, BORDER, COLOUR, FILLTYPE, HATCHING, LINESTYLE,  LINEWIDTH
        JUSTIFY, SCALE, PIX, PITCH, ALIGN

        # Fill with hatching in two different colours
        $x=<a href="../man10/sequence.10.html">sequence</a>(10)/10;
        # First fill with cyan hatching
        poly $x, $x**2, {COLOR=&gt;5, FILL=&gt;3};
        hold;
        # Then do it over again with the hatching offset in phase:
        poly $x, $x**2, {COLOR=&gt;6, FILL=&gt;3, HATCH=&gt;{PHASE=&gt;0.5}};
        release;

   <b>circle</b>
       Plot a circle on the display using the fill setting.

        Usage: circle($x, $y, $radius [, $opt]);

       All arguments can alternatively be given in the options hash using the following options:

       XCenter and YCenter
           The position of the center of the circle

       Radius
           The radius of the circle.

   <b>ellipse</b>
       Plot an ellipse, optionally using fill style.

        Usage: ellipse($x, $y, $smaj, $smin, $theta [, $opt]);

       All  arguments can alternatively be given in the options hash using the following options (for historical
       reasons the names MajorAxis and MinorAxis have been preserved though they really refer to the semi-axes):

       MajorAxis
           The semi-major axis of the ellipse - this must be defined or $smaj must be given.

       MinorAxis
           The semi-minor axis, like "MajorAxis" this is required or $smin must be given.

       Theta (synonym Angle)
           The orientation of the ellipse - defaults to 0.0. This is given in radians.

       XCenter and YCenter
           The coordinates of the center of the ellipse. These must be specified or $x and $y must be given.

       NPoints
           The number of points used to draw the ellipse. This defaults to 100 and might need  changing  in  the
           case of very large ellipses.

       The routine also recognises the same standard options as accepted by "poly".

   <b>rectangle</b>
       Draw a rectangle.

        Usage: rectangle($xcenter, $ycenter, $xside, $yside, [, $angle, $opt]);

       This  routine  draws a rectangle with the chosen fill style. Internally it calls "poly" which is somewhat
       slower than "pgrect" but which allows for rotated rectangles as well. The  routine  recognises  the  same
       options as "poly" and in addition the following:

       XCenter and YCenter
           The position of the center of the rectangle. XCentre and YCentre are valid synonyms.

       XSide and YSide
           The  length  of the X and Y sides. If only one is specified the shape is taken to be square with that
           as the side-length, alternatively the user can set Side

       Side
           The length of the sides of the rectangle (in this case a square) - syntactic sugar for setting  XSide
           and YSide identical. This is overridden by XSide or YSide if any of those are set.

       Angle (synonym Theta)
           The angle at which the rectangle is to be drawn. This defaults to 0.0 and is given in radians.

   <b>vect</b>
       Display 2 images as a vector field

        Usage: vect ( $w, $x, $y, [$scale, $pos, $transform, $misval], { opt } );
               $w-&gt;vect($x,$y,[$scale,$pos,$transform,$misval], { opt });

       Notes:  $transform for image/cont etc. is used in the same way as the TR() array in the underlying PGPLOT
       FORTRAN routine but is, fortunately, zero-offset. The <b>transform()</b> routine can  be  used  to  create  this
       ndarray.

       This routine will plot a vector field. $x is the horizontal component and $y the vertical component.  The
       scale  factor  converts  between  vector  length  units and scientific positional units.  You can set the
       scale, position, etc. either by passing in parameters in the normal  parameter  list  or  by  passing  in
       options.

       Options recognised:

            SCALE - Set the scale factor for vector lengths.
              POS - Set the position of vectors.
                    &lt;0 - vector head at coordinate
                    &gt;0 - vector base at coordinate
                    =0 - vector centered on the coordinate
        TRANSFORM - The pixel-to-world coordinate transform vector
          MISSING - Elements with this value are ignored.

       The following standard options influence this command:

        ARROW, ARROWSIZE, AXIS, BORDER, CHARSIZE, COLOUR,
        LINESTYLE, LINEWIDTH,

        $x=rvals(11,11,{Centre=&gt;[5,5]});
        $y=rvals(11,11,{Centre=&gt;[0,0]});
        vect $x, $y, {COLOR=&gt;YELLOW, ARROWSIZE=&gt;0.5, LINESTYLE=&gt;dashed};

   <b>fits_vect</b>
       Display a pair of 2-D ndarrays as vectors, with FITS header interpretation

        Usage: fits_vect ($x, $y, [$scale, $pos, $transform, $misval] )

       "fits_vect" is to "vect" as "fits_imag" is to "imag".

   <b>transform</b>
       Create transform array for contour and image plotting

        $win-&gt;transform([$xdim,$ydim], $options);

       (For  information on coordinate transforms, try PDL::Transform.)  This function creates a transform array
       in the format required by the image and contouring routines. You must call it with the dimensions of your
       image as arguments or pass these as an anonymous hash - see the example below.

       Angle
           The rotation angle of the transform, in radians.  Positive numbers rotate the image clockwise on  the
           screen.

       ImageDimensions
           The  dimensions  of  the  image  the  transform is required for. The dimensions should be passed as a
           reference to an array.

       Pixinc
           The increment in output coordinate per pixel.

       ImageCenter (or ImageCentre)
           The centre of the image as an anonymous array <b>or</b> as a  scalar,  in  scientific  coordinates.  In  the
           latter  case  the x and y value for the center will be set equal to this scalar. This is particularly
           useful in the common case when the center is (0, 0).   (ImageCenter  overrides  RefPos  if  both  are
           specified).

       RefPos (or ReferencePosition)
           If  you  wish to set a pixel other than the image centre to a given value, use this option. It should
           be supplied with a reference to an array containing 2 2-element array references, e.g.

            RefPos =&gt; [ [ $xpix, $ypix ], [ $xplot, $yplot ] ]

           This will label pixel "($xpix,$ypix)" as being at position "($xplot,$yplot)".  For example

            RefPos      =&gt; [ [100,74], [ 0, 0 ] ]

           sets the scientific coordinate origin to be at the center of  the  (100,74)  pixel  coordinate.   The
           pixel  coordinates  are  pixel-centered,  and  start  counting  from 0 (as all good pixel coordinates
           should).

       Example:

          $im = rvals(100, 100);
          $w = PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window-&gt;new(Device =&gt; '/xs');
          $t = $w-&gt;transform(dims($im), {ImageCenter =&gt; 0,  Pixinc =&gt; 5});
          $w-&gt;imag($im, {Transform =&gt; $t});

   <b>tline</b>
       Broadcasted line plotting

        $win-&gt;tline($x, $y, $options);

       This is a broadcasted interface to "line". This is convenient if you have a 2D array and want to plot out
       every line in one go. The routine will apply any options you apply in a "reasonable" way.  In  the  sense
       that it will loop over the options wrapping over if there are less options than lines.

       Example:

         $h={Colour =&gt; ['Red', '1', 4], Linestyle =&gt; ['Solid' ,'Dashed']};
         $tx=zeroes(100,5)-&gt;xlinvals(-5,5);
         $ty = $tx + $tx-&gt;yvals;
         $win-&gt;tline($tx, $ty, $h);

   <b>tpoints</b>
       A broadcasted interface to points

        Usage: tpoints($x, $y, $options);

       This  is  a broadcasted interface to "points". This is convenient if you have a 2D array and want to plot
       out every line in one go. The routine will apply any options you apply in  a  "reasonable"  way.  In  the
       sense that it will loop over the options wrapping over if there are less options than lines.

       Example:

         $h={Colour =&gt; ['Red', '1', 4], Linestyle =&gt; ['Solid' ,'Dashed']};
         $tx=zeroes(100,5)-&gt;xlinvals(-5,5);
         $ty = $tx + $tx-&gt;yvals;
         tpoints($tx, $ty, $h);

   <b>tcircle</b>
       A broadcasted interface to circle

        Usage: tcircle($x, $y, $r, $options);

       This  is a broadcasted interface to "circle". This is convenient if you have a list of circle centers and
       radii and want to draw every circle in one go.  The routine  will  apply  any  options  you  apply  in  a
       "reasonable" way, in the sense that it will loop over the options wrapping over if there are less options
       than circles.

       Example:

        $x=<a href="../man5/sequence.5.html">sequence</a>(5);
        $y=<a href="../man5/random.5.html">random</a>(5);
        $r=<a href="../man5/sequence.5.html">sequence</a>(5)/10 + 0.1;
        $h={justify =&gt; 1,Color =&gt; ['red','green','blue'], filltype =&gt; ['solid','outline','hatched','cross_hatched']};
        tcircle($x, $y, $r, $h);

       Note  that  $x  and  $y  must  be  the  same  size  (&gt;1D is OK, though meaningless as far as "tcircle" is
       concerned). $r can be the same size as $x OR a 1-element ndarray OR a single perl scalar.

   <b>Text</b> <b>routines</b>
   <b>text</b>
       Write text in a plot window at a specified position.

        Usage: text ($text, $x, $y [, $opt])

       Options recognised:

       "ANGLE"
           The angle in degrees between the baseline  of  the  text  and  the  horisontal  (increasing  counter-
           clockwise). This defaults to 0.

       "JUSTIFICATION"
           The  justification  of  the  text  relative to the position specified. It defaults to 0.0 which gives
           left-justified text. A value of 0.5 gives centered text and a  value  of  1.0  gives  right-justified
           text.

       "XPos", "YPos", "Text"
           These gives alternative ways to specify the text and position.

       "BackgroundColour"
           This  sets  the  background colour for the text in case an opaque background is desired. You can also
           use the synonyms "Bg" and "BackgroundColor".

       The following standard options influence this command:

          COLOUR, CHARSIZE

         line <a href="../man10/sequence.10.html">sequence</a>(10), <a href="../man10/sequence.10.html">sequence</a>(10)**2;
         text 'A parabola', 3, 9, {Justification =&gt; 1, Angle=&gt;atan2(6,1)};

   <b>legend</b>
       Add a legend to a plot

        Usage: legend($text, $x, $y, [, $width], $opt]);

       This function adds a legend to an existing plot. The action is primarily controlled by information in the
       options hash, and the basic idea is that $x and $y determines the upper left hand corner of  the  box  in
       which the legend goes. If the width is specified either as an argument or as an option in the option hash
       this is used to determine the optimal character size to fit the text into part of this width (defaults to
       0.5 - see the description of "TextFraction" below). The rest of the width is filled out with either lines
       or symbols according to the content of the "LineStyle", "Symbol", "Colour" and "LineWidth" options.

       The local options recognised are as follows:

       "Text"
           An anonymous array of annotations, can also be specified directly.

       "XPos" and "YPos"
           The X and Y position of the upper left-hand corner of the text.

       "Width" and "Height"
           The width and/or height of each line (including symbol/line). This is used to determine the character
           size. If any of these are set to 'Automatic' the current character size will be used.

       "TextFraction"
           The  text  and  the  symbol/line  is set inside a box. "TextFraction" determines how much of this box
           should be devoted to text. This defaults to 0.5. You can also use "Fraction" as a synonym to this.

       "TextShift"
           This option allows for fine control of the spacing between the text and the start of the line/symbol.
           It is given in fractions of the total width of the legend box. The default value is 0.1.

       "VertSpace" or "VSpace"
           By default the text lines are separated by one character height (in the sense that if the  separation
           were  0  then they would lie on top of each other). The "VertSpace" option allows you to increase (or
           decrease) this gap in units of the character height; a value of 0.5 would add half a character height
           to the gap between lines, and -0.5 would remove the same distance.  The default value is 0.

       "BackgroundColour"
           This sets the background colour for the text in case an opaque background is desired.  You  can  also
           use the synonyms "Bg" and "BackgroundColor".

         line $x, $y, {Color =&gt; 'Red', LineStyle =&gt; 'Solid'};
         line $x2, $y2, {Color =&gt; 'Blue', 'LineStyle' =&gt; 'Dashed', LineWidth =&gt; 10};

         legend ['A red line', 'A blue line'], 5, 5,
             {LineStyle =&gt; ['Solid', 'Dashed'], Colour =&gt; ['Red', 'Blue']
              LineWidth =&gt; [undef, 10]}; # undef gives default.

   <b>Cursor</b> <b>routines</b>
   <b>cursor</b>
       Interactively read cursor positions.

        Usage: ($x, $y, $ch, $xref, $yref) = cursor($opt)

       This  routine  has  no standard input parameters, but the type of cursor can be set by setting the option
       "Type" as a key in the anonymous hash $opt. The first three return values from the  function  are  always
       defined and gives the position selected by the user and the character pressed.

       Depending  on  the  cursor  type  selected  the last two arguments might also be defined and these give a
       reference position. For instance if the cursor is selected to be "Rectangle" then the reference  position
       gives one of the corners of the rectangle and $x and $y the diagonally opposite one.

       Options recognised:

       XRef, YRef
           The reference position to be used

       Type
           The  type  of  cursor.  This  can  be  selected  using  a  number  between  0  and 7 as in PGPLOT, or
           alternatively  you  can  specify  these  as,  "Default"  (0),  "RadialLine"  (1),  "Rectangle"   (2),
           "TwoHorizontalLines"  (3),  "TwoVerticalLines"  (4),  "HorizontalLine"  (5),  "VerticalLine"  (6) and
           "CrossHair" (7) respectively. The default cursor is just the normal mouse cursor.

           For   the   "RadialLine"   you   <u>must</u>   specify   the    reference    point,    whereas    for    the
           "Two(Vertical|Horizontal)Lines" cursor the X or Y reference point, respectively, must be specified.

       To select a region on a plot, use the rectangle cursor:

         ($x, $y, $ch, $xref, $yref) = cursor({Type =&gt; 'Rectangle'});
         poly pdl($x, $xref, $xref, $x, $x), pdl($y, $y, $yref, $yref, $y);

       To select a region of the X-axis:

         ($x1, $y1, $ch) = cursor({Type =&gt; 'VerticalLine'});
         ($x2, $y2, $ch) = cursor({Type =&gt; 'TwoVerticalLines', XRef =&gt; $x1});

</pre><h4><b>Internal</b> <b>routines</b></h4><pre>
   <b>catch_signals</b>
       To  prevent  pgplot  from  doing  a  fandango  on  core, we have to block interrupts during PGPLOT calls.
       Specifically, INT needs to get caught.  These internal routines provide a mechanism for that.

       You simply bracket any PGPLOT calls with "catch_signals":

        catch_signals {
          ...
          pgcube($n, $x-&gt;get_dataref);
        };

       and the signal_catcher will queue up any signals (like INT -- the control-C interrupt) until the  end  of
       the block.

   <b>_open_new_window</b>
       Open  a  new  window.  This sets the window ID, which is the one used when accessing a window later using
       "pgslct". It also sets the window name to something easily remembered if it has not been set before.

   <b>_setup_window</b>
       This routine sets up a new window with its shape and size. This  is  also  where  the  size  options  are
       actually  parsed.  These  are  then  forgotten  (well,  they  are  stored  in  $self-&gt;{Options})  and the
       corresponding aspect ratio and window width is stored.  See the discussion under <b>new()</b> for the logic.

       Finally the subpanels are set up using "pgsubp" and colours  and  linewidth  are  adjusted  according  to
       whether we have a hardcopy device or not.

   <b>_status</b>
       This  routine  checks PGPLOT's status for the window. It returns OPEN if the window is open and CLOSED if
       it is closed.  (Windows can be closed but still exist).

   <b>_reopen</b>
       This functions reopens a window. Since this is an internal function it does not  have  a  lot  of  error-
       checking. Make sure the device is closed <u>before</u> calling this routine.

       There  is  an unfortunate problem which pops up viz. that the window name cannot be changed at this point
       since we are offering that to the rest of the world. That might be sensible, but it means that the window
       name will not reflect the id of the window - use id()  for  that  (this  is  also  why  we  do  not  call
       "open_new_window" )

   <b>_advance_panel</b>
       This  routine  advances  one  plot panel, updating the CurrentPanel as well.  If the advance will proceed
       past the page the page will be erased. Also note that when you advance one panel the hold value  will  be
       changed.

   <b>_check_move_or_erase</b>
       This  routine is a utility routine which checks if we need to move panel, and if so will do this. It also
       checks if it is necessary to advance panels, and whether they need to be erased.

   <b>_broadcast_options</b>
       This function is a cludgy utility function that expands an options hash to an  array  of  hashes  looping
       over options. This is mainly of use for "broadcasted" interfaces to standard plotting routines.

   <b>options</b>
       Access  the  options  used when <u>originally</u> opening the window. At the moment this is not updated when the
       window is changed later.

   <b>id</b>
       Access the window ID that PGPLOT uses for the present window.

   <b>device</b>
       This function returns the device type of the present window.

   <b>name</b>
       Accessor to set and examine the name of a window.

   <b>focus</b>
       Set focus for subsequent PGPLOT commands to this window.

   <b>info</b>
       Get general information about the PGPLOT environment.

        @ans = $self-&gt;info( @item );

       The valid values of @item are as below, where case is not important:

         VERSION     - What PGPLOT version is in use.
         STATE       - The status of the output device, this is returns 'OPEN'.
                       if the device is open and 'CLOSED' otherwise.
         USER        - The username of the owner of the spawning program.
         NOW         - The current date and time in the format
                       'dd-MMM-yyyy hh:mm'. Most people are likely to use Perl
                       functions instead.
         DEVICE    * - The current PGPLOT device or file, see also device().
         FILE      * - The filename for the current device.
         TYPE      * - And the device type for the current device.
         DEV/TYPE  * - This combines DEVICE and TYPE in a form that can be used
                       as input to new.
         HARDCOPY  * - This is flag which is set to 'YES' if the current device is
                       a hardcopy device and 'NO' otherwise.
         TERMINAL  * - This flag is set to 'YES' if the current device is the
                       user's terminal and 'NO' otherwise.
         CURSOR    * - A flag ('YES' or 'NO') to inform whether the current device
                       has a cursor.

       Those items marced with a "*" only return a valid answer if the window is open.  A question mark ("?") is
       returned if the item is not recognised or the information is not available.

   <b>_extract_hash</b>
       This routine takes and array and returns the first hash reference found as well as  those  elements  that
       are <u>not</u> hashes. Note the latter point because all other references to hashes in the array will be lost.

   <b>_parse_unit</b>
       Convert  a unit string or number into a PGPLOT-certified length unit specification, or return undef if it
       won't go.

   <b>_parse_options</b>
       This is a convenience routine for parsing a set of options. It returns both the full set of  options  and
       those that the user has set.

   <b>_save_status</b>
       Saves  the  PGPLOT  state  so that changes to settings can be made and then the present state restored by
       "_restore_status".

   <b>_restore_status</b>
       Restore the PGPLOT state. See "_save_status".

   <b>_checkarg</b>
       This routine checks and optionally alters the arguments given to it.

   <b>_set_colour</b>
       This is an internal routine that encapsulates all the nastiness  of  setting  colours  depending  on  the
       different PGPLOT colour models (although HLS is not supported).

       The routine works in the following way:

       •       At  initialisation  of  the plot device the work colour index is set to 16. The work index is the
               index the routine will modify unless the user has specified something else.

       •       The routine should be used after standard interpretation and synonym matching has been  used.  So
               if the colour is given as input is an integer that colour index is used.

       •       If the colour is a reference the routine checks whether it is an "ARRAY" or a "PDL" reference. If
               it is not an error message is given.  If it is a "PDL" reference it will be converted to an array
               ref.

       •       If the array has four elements the first element is interpreted as the colour index to modify and
               this  overrules  the setting for the work index used internally. Otherwise the work index is used
               and incremented until the maximum number  of  colours  for  the  output  device  is  reached  (as
               indicated  by "pgqcol"). Should you wish to change that you need to read the PGPLOT documentation
               - it is somewhat device dependent.

       •       When the array has been recognised the R,G and B colours of the user-set index or work  index  is
               set using the "pgscr" command and we are finished.

       •       If  the  input  colour  instead  is  a  string  we try to set the colour using the PGPLOT routine
               "pgscrn" with no other error-checking. This should be ok,   as  that  routine  returns  a  rather
               sensible error-message.

   <b>_standard_options_parser</b>
       This  internal  routine  is  the default routine for parsing options. This routine deals with a subset of
       options that most routines will accept.

   <b>_image_xyrange</b>
       Given a PGPLOT tr matrix and an image size, calculate the data world coordinates  over  which  the  image
       ranges.   This is used in "imag" and "cont".  It keeps track of the required half-pixel offset to display
       images  properly  --  eg  feeding  in  no  tr  matrix  at  all,  nx=20,  and  ny=20  will   will   return
       (-0.5,19.5,-0.5,19.5).  It also checks the options hash for XRange/YRange specifications and, if they are
       present, it overrides the appropriate output with the exact ranges in those fields.

   <b>_FITS_tr</b>
       Given  a  FITS  image, return the PGPLOT transformation matrix to convert pixel coordinates to scientific
       coordinates.   Used by "fits_imag", "fits_rgbi", and  "fits_cont",  but  may  come  in  handy  for  other
       methods.

         my $tr = _FITS_tr( $win, $img );
         my $tr = _FITS_tr( $win, $img, $opts );

       The  return  value  ($tr  in the examples above) is the same as returned by the <b>transform()</b> routine, with
       values set up to convert the pixel to scientific coordinate values for the  two-dimensional  image  $img.
       The $opts argument is optional and should be a HASH reference; currently it only understands one key (any
       others are ignored):

         WCS =&gt; undef (default), "", or "A" to "Z"

       Both  the  key  name and value are case insensitive. If left as "undef" or "" then the primary coordinate
       mapping from the header is used, otherwise use the  additional  WCS  mapping  given  by  the  appropriate
       letter.   We  make  <b>no</b>  checks  that  the  given mapping is available; the routine falls back to the unit
       mapping if the specified system is not available.

       The   WCS   option   has   only   been   tested   on   images   from   the   Chandra   X-ray    satellite
       (&lt;<a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/">http://chandra.harvard.edu/</a>&gt;)  created  by  the CIAO software package (&lt;<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/">http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/</a>&gt;),
       for which you should set "WCS =&gt; "P"" to use the "PHYSICAL" coordinate system.

       World Coordinate Systems in FITS.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b></h4><pre>
       The coding tries to follow reasonable standards, so that all functions starting with an underscore should
       be  considered  as  internal and should not be called from outside the package. In addition most routines
       have a set of options. These are encapsulated and are not accessible outside  the  routine.  This  is  to
       avoid collisions between different variables.
