</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module allows PDL data to be plotted using Gnuplot as a backend for 2D and 3D plotting and image
       display.  Gnuplot (not affiliated with the GNU project) is a venerable, open-source program that produces
       both interactive and publication-quality plots on many different output devices.  It is available through
       most Linux repositories, on MacOS, and from its website &lt;<a href="http://www.gnuplot.info">http://www.gnuplot.info</a>&gt;.

       It is not necessary to understand the gnuplot syntax to generate basic, or even complex, plots - though
       the full syntax is available for advanced users who want the full flexibility of the Gnuplot backend.

       For a very quick demonstration of the power of this module, see this YouTube demo video
       &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUXDQL3rZ_0&gt;, and others on visualisation of tesseract assembly
       &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykQmNrSKqGQ&gt; and rotation &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tpsPYBrHy0&gt;.

       Gnuplot recognizes both hard-copy and interactive plotting devices, and on interactive devices (like X11)
       it is possible to pan, scale, and rotate both 2-D and 3-D plots interactively.  You can also enter
       graphical data through mouse clicks on the device window.  On some hardcopy devices (e.g. "PDF") that
       support multipage output, it is necessary to close the device after plotting to ensure a valid file is
       written out.

       "PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot" exports two routines by default: a constructor, gpwin() and a general purpose
       plot routine, gplot().  Depending on options, gplot() can produce line plots, scatterplots, error boxes,
       "candlesticks", images, or any overlain combination of these elements; or perspective views of 3-D
       renderings such as surface plots.

       A call to gplot() looks like:

        gplot({temp_plot_options}, # optional hash ref
             curve_options, data, data, ... ,
             curve_options, data, data, ... );

       The data entries are columns to be plotted.  They are normally an optional ordinate and a required
       abscissa, but some plot modes can use more columns than that.  The collection of columns is called a
       "tuple".  Each column must be a separate PDL or an ARRAY ref.  If all the columns are PDLs, you can add
       extra dimensions to make threaded collections of curves.

       PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot also implements an object oriented interface. Plot objects track individual
       gnuplot subprocesses.  Direct calls to gplot() are tracked through a global object that stores globally
       set configuration variables.

       The gplot() sub (or the plot() method) collects two kinds of options hash: <b>plot</b> <b>options</b>, which describe
       the overall structure of the plot being produced (e.g. axis specifications, window size, and title), and
       <b>curve</b> <b>options</b>, which describe the behavior of individual traces or collections of points being plotted.
       In addition, the module itself supports options that allow direct pass-through of plotting commands to
       the underlying gnuplot process.

   <b>Basic</b> <b>plotting</b>
       Gnuplot generates many kinds of plot, from basic line plots and histograms to scaled labels.  Individual
       plots can be 2-D or 3-D, and different sets of plot styles are supported in each mode.  Plots can be sent
       to a variety of devices; see the description of plot options, below.

       You can specify what type of graphics output you want, but in most cases doing nothing will cause a plot
       to be rendered on your screen: with X windows on UNIX or Linux systems, with an XQuartz window on MacOS,
       or with a native window on Microsoft Windows.

       You select a plot style with the "with" curve option, and feed in columns of data (usually ordinate
       followed by abscissa).  The collection of columns is called a "tuple".  These plots have two columns in
       their tuples:

        $x = <a href="../man51/xvals.51.html">xvals</a>(51)-25; $y = $x**2;
        gplot(with=&gt;'points', $x, $y);  # Draw points on a parabola
        gplot(with=&gt;'lines', $x, $y);   # Draw a parabola
        gplot({title=&gt;"Parabolic fit"},
              with=&gt;"yerrorbars", legend=&gt;"data", $x, $y+(random($y)-0.5)*2*$y/20, pdl($y/20),
              with=&gt;"lines",      legend=&gt;"fit",  $x, $y);

       Normal threading rules apply across the arguments to a given plot.

       All data are required to be supplied as either PDLs or array refs.  If you use an array ref as a data
       column, then normal threading is disabled.  For example:

        $x = <a href="../man5/xvals.5.html">xvals</a>(5);
        $y = <a href="../man5/xvals.5.html">xvals</a>(5)**2;
        $labels = ['one','two','three','four','five'];
        gplot(with=&gt;'labels',$x,$y,$labels);

       See below for supported curve styles.

       <u>Modifying</u> <u>plots</u>

       Gnuplot is built around a monolithic plot model - it is not possible to add new data directly to a plot
       without redrawing the entire plot. To support replotting, PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot stores the data you plot
       in the plot object, so that you can add new data with the "replot" command:

        $w=gpwin(x11);
        $x=<a href="../man101/xvals.101.html">xvals</a>(101)/100;
        $y=$x;
        $w-&gt;plot($x,$y);
        $w-&gt;replot($x,$y*$y);

       For speed, the data are *not* disconnected from their original variables - so this will plot X vs.
       sqrt(X):

        $x = <a href="../man101/xvals.101.html">xvals</a>(101)/100;
        $y = <a href="../man101/xvals.101.html">xvals</a>(101)/100;
        $w-&gt;plot($x,$y);
        $y-&gt;inplace-&gt;sqrt;
        $w-&gt;replot();

       <u>Plotting</u> <u>to</u> <u>an</u> <u>image</u> <u>file</u> <u>or</u> <u>device</u>

       PDL:Graphics::Gnuplot can plot to most of the devices supported by gnuplot itself.  You can specify the
       file type with the "output" method or the object constructor "gplot".  Either one will allow you to name
       a type of file to produce, and a collection of options speciic to that type of output file.

       <u>Image</u> <u>plotting</u>

       Several of the plot styles accept image data.  The tuple parameters work the same way as for basic plots,
       but each "column" is a 2-D PDL rather than a 1-D PDL.  As a special case, the "with image" plot style
       accepts either a 2-D or a 3-D PDL.  If you pass in 3-D PDL, the extra dimension can have size 1, 3, or 4.
       It is interpreted as running across (R,G,B,A) color planes.

       <u>3-D</u> <u>plotting</u>

       You can plot in 3-D by setting the plot option "trid" to a true value.  Three dimensional plots accept
       either 1-D or 2-D PDLs as data columns.  If you feed in 2-D "columns", many of the common plot styles
       will generalize appropriately to 3-D.  For example, to plot a 2-D surface as a line grid, you can use the
       "lines" style and feed in 2-D columns instead of 1-D columns.

   <b>Enhanced</b> <b>text</b>
       Most gnuplot output devices include the option to markup "enhanced text". That means text is interpreted
       so that you can change its font and size, and insert superscripts and subscripts into labels.  Codes are:

       {} Text grouping - enclose text in braces to group characters, as in LaTeX.

       ^  Superscript the next character or group (shrinks it slightly too where that is supported).

       _  Subscript the next character or group (shrinks it slightly too where that is supported).

       @  Phantom box (occupies no width; controls height for super- and subscripting)

       &amp;  Controllable-width space, e.g. &amp;amp;{template-string}

       ~  overstrike -- e.g. ~a{0.8-} overprints '-' on 'a', raised by 0.8xfontsize.

       {/[fontname][=fontsize | *fontscale] text}
          Change font to (optional) fontname, and optional absolute font size or relative font scale ("fontsize"
          and "fontscale" are numbers).  The space after the size parameter is not rendered.

       \  Backslash escapes control characters to render them as themselves.

   <b>Unicode</b> <b>text</b>
       Separately to "enhanced" text above, if you wish to include text that is not ASCII, then you will need to
       pass data that has been UTF-8 encoded. Sample code to achieve this:

         use utf8;
         use Encode;
         use PDL;
         use PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot;
         use PDL::Constants qw(PI);

         sub plot_sin {
           my ($w, $coeff) = @_;
           my $xrange = [ -2*PI, 2*PI ];
           my $x = <a href="../man1e3/zeroes.1e3.html">zeroes</a>(1e3)-&gt;xlinvals(@$xrange); my $y = sin($coeff * 2 * PI * $x);
           my $title = "y = sin( $coeff * 2π * x )";
           # to get around sending text through syswrite()
           my $title_octets = encode('UTF-8', $title);
           $w-&gt;plot(with=&gt;'lines', $x, $y, {
             xrange =&gt; $xrange,
             title =&gt; $title_octets, # can not pass $title as-is
           });
         }

   <b>Color</b> <b>specification</b>
       There  are  several  contexts  where  you  can  specify color of plot elements.  In those places, you can
       specify colors exactly as in the Gnuplot manual, or more tersely.  In general, a color spec  can  be  any
       one of the following:

       - an integer
          This specifies a recognizable unique color in the same order as used by the plotting engine.

       - the name of a color
          (e.g. "blue").  Supported color names are listed in the variable @Alien::Gnuplot::colors.

       - an RGB value string
          Strings  have  the  form  "#RRGGBB",  where  the "#" is literal and the RR, GG, and BB are hexadecimal
          bytes.

       - the word "palette"
          "palette" indicates that color is to be drawn from the scaled colorbar palette (which you can set with
          the "clut" plot option), by lookup using an additional column in the associated data tuple.

       - the word "variable"
          "variable" indicates that color is to be drawn from the integer plotting colors used by  the  plotting
          engine, indexed by an additional column in the associated data tuple.

       - the phrase "rgb variable"
          "rgb  variable"  indicates that color is to be directly specified by a 24 bit integer specifying 8-bit
          values for (from most significant byte to least significant byte) R, G, and B  in  the  output  color.
          The integer is drawn from an additional column in the associated data tuple.

   <b>Plot</b> <b>styles</b> <b>supported</b>
       Gnuplot  itself  supports  a  wide range of plot styles, and all are supported by PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot.
       Most of the basic plot styles collect tuples of 1-D columns in 2-D mode (for ordinary plots),  or  either
       1-D  or  2-D  "columns" in 3-D mode (for grid surface plots and such).  Image modes always collect tuples
       made of 2-D "columns".

       You can pass in 1-D columns as either PDLs or ARRAY refs.  That is important  for  plot  types  (such  as
       "labels") that require a collection of strings rather than numeric data.

       Each  plot style can by modified to support particular colors or line style options.  These modifications
       get  passed  in  as  curve  options  (see  below).  For  example,  to  plot  a  blue  line  you  can  use
       "with=&gt;'lines',lc=&gt;'blue'".   To  match the autogenerated style of a particular line you can use the "ls"
       curve option.

       The GNuplot plot styles supported are:

       •  "boxerrorbars" - combo of "boxes" and "yerrorbars", below (2D)

       •  "boxes" - simple boxes around regions on the plot (2D)

       •  "boxxyerrorbars" - Render X and Y error bars as boxes (2D)

       •  "candlesticks" - Y error bars with inner and outer limits (2D)

       •  "circles" - circles with variable radius at each point: X/Y/radius (2D)

       •  "dots" - tiny points ("dots") at each point, e.g. for scatterplots (2D/3D)

       •  "ellipses" - ellipses.  Accepts X/Y/major/minor/angle (2D)

       •  "filledcurves" - closed polygons or axis-to-line filled shapes (2D)

       •  "financebars" - financial style plot. Accepts date/open/low/high/close (2D)

       •  "fsteps" - square bin plot; delta-Y, then delta-X (see "steps", "histeps") (2D)

       •  "histeps" - square bin plot; plateaus centered on X coords (see "fsteps", "steps") (2D)

       •  "histogram" - binned histogram of dataset (not direct plot; see "newhistogram") (2D)

       •  "fits" - (PDL-specific) renders FITS image files in scientific coordinates

       •  "image" - Takes (i), (x,y,i), or (x,y,z,i).  See "rgbimage", "rgbalpha", "fits". (2D/3D)

       •  "impulses" - vertical line from axis to the plotted point (2D/3D)

       •  "labels" - Text labels at specified locations all over the plot (2D/3D)

       •  "lines" - regular line plot (2D/3D)

       •  "linespoints" - line plot with symbols at plotted points (2D/3D)

       •  "newhistogram" - multiple-histogram-friendly histogram style (see "histogram") (2D)

       •  "points" - symbols at plotted points (2D/3D)

       •  "rgbalpha" - R/G/B color image with variable transparency (2D/3D)

       •  "rgbimage" - R/G/B color image (2D/3D)

       •  "steps" - square bin plot; delta-X, then delta-Y (see "fsteps", "histeps") (2D)

       •  "vectors" - Small arrows: (x,y,[z]) -&gt; (x+dx,y+dy,[z+dz]) (2D/3D)

       •  "xerrorbars" - points with X error bars ("T" form) (2D)

       •  "xyerrorbars" - points with both X and Y error bars ("T" form) (2D)

       •  "yerrorbars" - points with Y error bars ("T" form) (2D)

       •  "xerrorlines" - line plot with X errorbars at each point.  (2D)

       •  "xyerrorlines" - line plot with XY errorbars at each point. (2D)

       •  "yerrorlines" - line plot with Y error limits at each point. (2D)

       •  "pm3d" - three-dimensional variable-position surface plot

   <b>Options</b> <b>arguments</b>
       The plot options are parameters that affect the whole plot, like the title of the plot, the axis  labels,
       the  extents,  2d/3d  selection,  etc.  All the plot options are described below in "Plot Options".  Plot
       options can be set in the plot object, or passed to the plotting methods directly.  Plot options  can  be
       passed  in  as  a  leading  interpolated  hash,  as  a leading hash ref, or as a trailing hash ref in the
       argument list to any of the main plotting routines ("gplot", "plot", "image", etc.).

       The curve options are parameters that affect only one curve  in  particular.  Each  call  to  plot()  can
       contain  many  curves, and options for a particular curve <u>precede</u> the data for that curve in the argument
       list. The actual type of curve (the "with" option)  is  persistent,  but  all  other  curve  options  and
       modifiers are not.  An example:

        gplot( with =&gt; 'points',  $x, $a,
               {axes=&gt; x1y2},     $x, $b,
               with =&gt; 'lines',   $x, $c );

       This  plots  3  curves: $a vs. $x plotted with points on the main y-axis (this is the default), $b vs. $x
       plotted with points on the secondary y axis, and $c vs. $x plotted with lines on  the  main  y-axis  (the
       default). Note that the curve options can be supplied as either an inline hash or a hash ref.

       All the curve options are described below in "Curve Options".

       If  you  want  to plot multiple curves of the same type without setting any curve options explicitly, you
       must include an empty hash ref between the tuples for subsequent lines, as in:

        gplot( $x, $a, {}, $x, $b, {}, $x, $c );

   <b>Data</b> <b>arguments</b>
       Following the curve options in the plot() argument list is the actual data  being  plotted.  Each  output
       data point is a "tuple" whose size varies depending on what is being plotted. For example if we're making
       a  simple 2D x-y plot, each tuple has 2 values; if we're making a 3d plot with each point having variable
       size and color, each tuple has 5 values (x,y,z,size,color). Each tuple element must be passed separately.
       For ordinary 2-D plots, the 0 dim of the tuple elements runs across  plotted  point.   PDL  threading  is
       active, so you can plot multiple curves with similar curve options on a normal 2-D plot, just by stacking
       data  inside  the passed-in PDLs.  (An exception is that threading is disabled if one or more of the data
       elements is a list ref).

       <u>PDLs</u> <u>vs</u> <u>array</u> <u>refs</u>

       The usual way to pass in data is as a PDL -- one PDL per column of data in the tuple.   But  strings,  in
       particular,  cannot easily be hammered into PDLs.  Therefore any column in each tuple can be an array ref
       containing values (either numeric or string).  The column is interpreted  using  the  usual  polymorphous
       cast-behind-your-back  behavior  of  Perl.  For the sake of sanity, if even one array ref is present in a
       tuple, then threading is disabled in that tuple: everything has to have a nice 1-D shape.

       <u>Implicit</u> <u>domains</u>

       When making a simple 2D plot,  if  exactly  1  dimension  is  missing,  PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot  will  use
       sequence(N)  as  the  domain.  This is why code like "plot(pdl(1,5,3,4,4) )" works. Only one PDL is given
       here, but the plot type ("lines" by default) requires 2 elements per tuple. We are thus exactly 1 ndarray
       short; <a href="../man5/sequence.5.html">sequence</a>(5) is used as the missing domain PDL.  This  is  thus  equivalent  to  "plot(<a href="../man5/sequence.5.html">sequence</a>(5),
       pdl(1,5,3,4,4) )".

       If  plotting  in  3d or displaying an image, an implicit domain will be used if we are exactly 2 ndarrays
       short. In this case, PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot will use a 2D grid as a domain. Example:

        my $xy = zeros(21,21)-&gt;ndcoords - pdl(10,10);
        gplot({'3d' =&gt; 1},
               with =&gt; 'points', inner($xy, $xy));
        gplot( with =&gt; 'image',  sin(rvals(51,51)) );

       Here the only given ndarray has dimensions (21,21). This is a 3D plot,  so  we  are  exactly  2  ndarrays
       short. Thus, PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot generates an implicit domain, corresponding to a 21-by-21 grid.

       "PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot" requires explicit separators between tuples for different plots, so it is always
       clear  from the arguments you pass in just how many columns you are supplying. For example, "plot($a,$b)"
       will plot $b vs. $a.  If you actually want to plot an overlay of both $a and $b against array index,  you
       want  "plot($a,{},$b)"  instead.  The "{}" is a hash ref containing a collection of all the curve options
       that you are changing between the two curves -- in this case, zero of them.

       PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot supports four styles of image plot, via the "with" curve option.

       The "image" style accepts a single image plane and displays it using the palette (pseudocolor  map)  that
       is  specified  in  the plot options for that plot.  As a special case, if you supply as data a (3xWxH) or
       (WxHx3) PDL it is treated as an RGB image and displayed with the "rgbimage" style (below), provided there
       are at least 5 pixels in each of the other two dimensions (just to be sure).   For  quick  image  display
       there is also an "image" method:

        use PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot qw/image gplot/;
        $im = sin(rvals(51,51)/2);
        image( $im );                # display the image
        gplot( with=&gt;'image', $im );  # display the image (longer form)

       The colors are autoscaled in both cases.  To set a particular color range, use the 'cbrange' plot option:

        image( {cbrange=&gt;[0,1]}, $im );

       You  can  plot  rgb  images directly with the image style, just by including a 3rd dimension of size 3 on
       your image:

        $rgbim = pdl( xvals($im), yvals($im),rvals($im)/<a href="../man2/sqrt.2.html">sqrt</a>(2));
        image( $rgbim );                # display an RGB image
        gplot( with=&gt;'image', $rgbim ); # display an RGB image (longer form)

       Some additional plot styles exist to specify RGB and RGB  transparent  forms  directly.   These  are  the
       "with"  styles  "rgbimage"  and  "rgbalpha".   For each of them you must specify the channels as separate
       PDLs:

        gplot( with=&gt;'rgbimage', $rgbim-&gt;dog );               # RGB  the long way
        gplot( with=&gt;'rgbalpha', $rgbim-&gt;dog, 255*($im&gt;0) );  # RGBA the long way

       According to the gnuplot specification you can also give X and Y values for each pixel, as in

        gplot( with=&gt;'image', xvals($im), yvals($im), $im )

       but this appears not to work properly for anything more complicated than a trivial  matrix  of  X  and  Y
       values.

       PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot  provides  a  "fits"  plot  style  that  interprets  World Coordinate System (WCS)
       information supplied in the header of the scientific  image  format  FITS.  The  image  is  displayed  in
       rectified  scientific  coordinates,  rather  than  in  pixel  coordinates.   You  can plot FITS images in
       scientific coordinates with

        gplot( with=&gt;'fits', $fitsdata );

       The fits plot style accepts a curve option "resample" (which may be  abbreviated),  that  allows  you  to
       downsample  and/or  rectify the image before it is passed to the Gnuplot back-end.  This is useful either
       to cut down on the burden of transferring large blocks of image data or to rectify images with  nonlinear
       WCS transformations in their headers.  (gnuplot itself has a bug that prevents direct rendering of images
       in nonlinear coordinates).

        gplot( with=&gt;'fits', res=&gt;1, $fitsdata );
        gplot( with=&gt;'fits', res=&gt;[200], $fitsdata );
        gplot( with=&gt;'fits', res=&gt;[100,400],$fitsdata );

       to specify that the output are to be resampled onto a square 1024x1024 grid, a 200x200 grid, or a 100x400
       grid,  respectively.  The resample sizes must be positive integers.  A true non-ref value will be treated
       as 1024x1024.

   <b>Interactivity</b>
       Several of the graphical backends of Gnuplot are interactive, allowing  you  to  pan,  zoom,  rotate  and
       measure the data interactively in the plot window. See the Gnuplot documentation for details about how to
       do  this.  Some  terminals  (such as "wxt") are persistently interactive. Other terminals (such as "x11")
       maintain their interactivity only while the underlying gnuplot process is active --  i.e.  until  another
       plot  is  created with the same PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot object, or until the perl process exits (whichever
       comes first).  Still others (the hardcopy devices) aren't interactive at all.

       Some interactive devices (notably "wxt" and "x11") also support mouse input: you can  write  PDL  scripts
       that accept and manipulate graphical input from the plotted window.

</pre><h4><b>PLOT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Gnuplot  controls  plot style with "plot options" that configure and specify virtually all aspects of the
       plot to be produced.   Plot options are tracked as stored state  in  the  PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot  object.
       You  can  set them by passing them in to the constructor, to an "options" method, or to the "plot" method
       itself.

       Nearly all the underlying Gnuplot plot options are supported, as well as some additional options that are
       parsed by the module itself for convenience.

       There are many, many plot options.  For convenience, we've grouped them by general category below.   Each
       group has a heading "POs for &lt;foo&gt;", describing the category.  You can skip below them all if you want to
       read about curve options or other aspects of PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot.

   <b>POs</b> <b>for</b> <b>Output:</b> <b>terminal,</b> <b>termoption,</b> <b>output,</b> <b>device,</b> <b>hardcopy</b>
       You  can  send  plots  to  a  variety  of different devices; Gnuplot calls devices "terminals".  With the
       object-oriented   interface,   you   must    set    the    output    device    with    the    constructor
       "PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot::new"  (or  the exported constructor "gpwin") or the "output" method.  If you use
       the simple non-object interface, you can set the output with the "terminal", "termoption",  and  "output"
       plot options.

       "terminal"  sets  the  output device type for Gnuplot, and "output" sets the actual output file or window
       number.

       "device" and "hardcopy"  are  for  convenience.  "device"  offers  a  PGPLOT-style  device  specifier  in
       "filename/device"  format (the "filename" gets sent to the "output" option, the "device" gets sent to the
       "terminal" option). "hardcopy" takes an output file name, attempts to parse out a file suffix and infer a
       device type. "hardcopy" also uses a common set of terminal options needed to fill an entire  letter  page
       with a plot.

       For  finer  grained  control of the plotting environment, you can send "terminal options" to Gnuplot.  If
       you set the terminal directly with plot options, you can include terminal options by  interpolating  them
       into  a  string,  as  in  "terminal jpeg interlace butt crop", or you can use the constructor "new" (also
       exported as "gpwin"), which parses terminal options as an argument list.

       The routine "PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot::terminfo" prints a list of all available terminals or, if  you  pass
       in a terminal name, options accepted by that terminal.

   <b>POs</b> <b>for</b> <b>Titles</b>
       The options described here are

       title
       xlabel
       x2label
       ylabel
       y2label
       zlabel
       cblabel
       key

       Gnuplot supports "enhanced" text escapes on most terminals; see "text", below.

       The "title" option lets you set a title for the whole plot.

       Individual  plot  components  are  labeled  with the "label" options.  "xlabel", "x2label", "ylabel", and
       "y2label" specify axis titles for 2-D plots.  The "zlabel" works for 3-D  plots.   The  "cblabel"  option
       sets the label for the color box, in plot types that have one (e.g.  image display).

       (Don't be confused by "clabel", which doesn't set a label at all, rather specifies the printf format used
       by contour labels in contour plots.)

       "key"  controls  where  the plot key (that relates line/symbol style to label) is placed on the plot.  It
       takes a scalar boolean indicating whether to turn the key on (with default values) or off,  or  an  array
       ref containing any of the following arguments (all are optional) in the order listed:

       •  ( on | off ) - turn the key on or off

       •  ( inside | outside | lmargin | rmargin | tmargin | bmargin | at &lt;pos&gt; )

          These  keywords  set  the  location of the key -- "inside/outside" is relative to the plot border; the
          margin keywords indicate location in the margins of the plot; and at &lt;pos&gt; (where &lt;pos&gt;  is  a  comma-
          delimited string containing (x,y): "key=&gt;[at=&gt;"0.5,0.5"]") is an exact location to place the key.

       •  ( left | right | center ) ( top | bottom | center ) - horiz./vert. alignment

       •  ( vertical | horizontal ) - stacking direction within the key

       •  ( Left | Right ) - justification of plot labels within the key (note case)

       •  [no]reverse - switch order of label and sample line

       •  [no]invert - invert the stack order of the labels

       •  samplen &lt;length&gt; - set the length of the sample lines

       •  spacing &lt;dist&gt; - set the spacing between adjacent labels in the list

       •  [no]autotitle - control whether labels are generated when not specified

       •  title "&lt;text&gt;" - set a title for the key

       •  [no]enhanced - override terminal settings for enhanced text interpretation

       •  font "&lt;face&gt;,&lt;size&gt;" - set font for the labels

       •  textcolor &lt;colorspec&gt;

       •  [no]box linestyle &lt;ls&gt; linetype &lt;lt&gt; linewidth &lt;lw&gt; - control box around the key

   <b>POs</b> <b>for</b> <b>axes,</b> <b>grids,</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>borders</b>
       The options described here are

       grid
       xzeroaxis
       x2zeroaxis
       yzeroaxis
       y2zeroaxis
       zzeroaxis
       border

       Normally,  tick  marks  and their labels are applied to the border of a plot, and no extra axes (e.g. the
       y=0 line) nor coordinate grids are shown.  You can specify which (if any) zero axes should be drawn,  and
       which (if any) borders should be drawn.

       The  "border"  option  controls  whether the plot itself has a border drawn around it.  You can feed it a
       scalar boolean value to indicate whether borders should be drawn around the plot -- or you can feed in  a
       list ref containing options.  The options are all optional but must be supplied in the order given.

       •  &lt;integer&gt; - packed bit flags for which border lines to draw

          The  default  if  you  set  a  true value for "border" is to draw all border lines.  You can feed in a
          single integer value containing a bit mask, to draw only some border lines.   From  LSB  to  MSB,  the
          coded  lines  are bottom, left, top, right for 2D plots -- e.g. 5 will draw bottom and top borders but
          neither left nor right.

          In three dimensions, 12 bits are used to describe the twelve edges of a cube surrounding the plot.  In
          groups of three, the first four control the bottom (xy) plane edges in the same order as  in  the  2-D
          plots; the middle four control the vertical edges that rise from the clockwise end of the bottom plane
          edges; and the last four control the top plane edges.

       •  ( back | front ) - draw borders first or last (controls hidden line appearance)

       •  linewidth &lt;lw&gt;, linestyle &lt;ls&gt;, linetype &lt;lt&gt;

          These are Gnuplot's usual three options for line control.

       The  "grid"  option  indicates  whether gridlines should be drawn on each axis.  It takes an array ref of
       arguments, each of which is either "no" or "m" or "", followed  by  an  axis  name  and  "tics"  --  e.g.
       "grid=&gt;["noxtics","ymtics"]"  draws no X gridlines and draws (horizontal) Y gridlines on Y axis major and
       minor tics, while "grid=&gt;["xtics","ytics"]" or "grid=&gt;["xtics ytics"]" will draw both  vertical  (X)  and
       horizontal (Y) grid lines on major tics.

       To  draw  a  coordinate  grid with default values, set "grid=&gt;1".  For more control, feed in an array ref
       with zero or more of the following parameters, in order:

       The "zeroaxis" keyword indicates whether to actually draw each axis line at the corresponding zero  along
       its  indicated  dimension.   For example, to draw the X axis (y=0), use "xzeroaxis=&gt;1".  If you just want
       the axis turned on with default values, you can feed in  a  Boolean  scalar;  if  you  want  to  set  its
       parameters,  you can feed in an array ref containing linewidth, linestyle, and linetype (with appropriate
       parameters for each), e.g.  "xzeroaxis=&gt;[linewidth=&gt;2]".

   <b>POs</b> <b>for</b> <b>axis</b> <b>range</b> <b>and</b> <b>mode</b>
       The options described here are

       xrange
       x2range
       yrange
       y2range
       zrange
       rrange
       cbrange
       trange
       urange
       vrange
       autoscale
       logscale

       Gnuplot accepts explicit ranges as plot options for all axes.  Each option  accepts  an  array  ref  with
       (min,  max).  If either min or max is missing, then the opposite limit is autoscaled.  The x and y ranges
       refer to the usual ordinate and abscissa of the plot; x2 and y2 refer to alternate ordinate and abscissa;
       z if for 3-D plots; r is for polar plots; t, u, and v are for parametric plots.  cb is for the color  box
       on plots that include it (see "color", below).

       "rrange" is used for radial coordinates (which are accessible using the "mapping" plot option, below).

       "cbrange"  (for  'color  box  range')  sets the range of values over which palette colors (either gray or
       pseudocolor) are matched.  It is valid in any color-mapped plot (including images or palette-mapped lines
       or points), even if no color box is being displayed for this plot.

       "trange", "urange", and "vrange" set ranges  for  the  parametric  coordinates  if  you  are  plotting  a
       parametric curve.

       By  default  all  axes are autoscaled unless you specify a range on that axis, and partially (min or max)
       autoscaled if you specify a partial range on that axis.  "autoscale" allows more explicit control of  how
       autoscaling  is  performed,  on  an  axis-by-axis  basis.   It  accepts a hash ref, each element of which
       specifies how a single axis should be autoscaled.  Each keyword contains an axis name followed by one  of
       "fix", "min", "max", "fixmin", or "fixmax".  You can set all the axes at once by setting the keyword name
       to ' '.  Examples:

        autoscale=&gt;{x=&gt;'max',y=&gt;'fix'};

       There is an older array ref syntax which is deprecated but still accepted.

       To  not  autoscale  an  axis  at  all,  specify  a  range for it. The fix style of autoscaling forces the
       autoscaler to use the actual min/max of the data as the limit for the corresponding axis  --  by  default
       the  axis  gets  extended  to the next minor tic (as set by the autoticker or by a tic specification, see
       below).

       "logscale" allows you to turn on logarithmic scaling for any or all axes, and to  set  the  base  of  the
       logarithm.   It  takes an array ref, the first element of which is a string mushing together the names of
       all the axes to  scale  logarithmically,  and  the  second  of  which  is  the  base  of  the  logarithm:
       "logscale=&gt;[xy=&gt;10]".  You can also leave off the base if you want base-10 logs: "logscale=&gt;['xy']".

   <b>POs</b> <b>for</b> <b>Axis</b> <b>tick</b> <b>marks</b>
       The options described here are

       xtics
       x2tics
       ytics
       y2tics
       ztics
       cbtics
       mxtics
       mx2tics
       mytics
       my2tics
       mztics
       mcbtics

       Axis  tick  marks  are  called  "tics"  within  Gnuplot,  and  they  are extensively controllable via the
       "{axis}tics" options.  In particular, major and minor ticks are supported, as  are  arbitrarily  variable
       length  ticks,  non-equally  spaced  ticks,  and  arbitrarily  labelled  ticks.   Support exists for time
       formatted ticks (see "POs for time data values" below).

       By default, gnuplot will automatically place major and minor ticks.  You can turn off ticks on an axis by
       setting the appropriate {foo}tics option to a defined, false scalar value (e.g. "xtics=&gt;0").  If you want
       to set major tics to happen at a regular specified intervals, you can set the appropriate tics option  to
       a  nonzero  scalar  value (e.g. "xtics=&gt;2" to specify a tic every 2 units on the X axis).  To use default
       values for the tick positioning, specify an empty hash or array  ref  (e.g.  "xtics=&gt;{}"),  or  a  string
       containing only whitespace (e.g. "xtics=&gt;' '").

       If  you  prepend  an  'm'  to  any  tics  option, it affects minor tics instead of major tics (major tics
       typically show units; minor tics typically show fractions of a unit).

       Each tics option can accept a hash ref containing options to pass to Gnuplot.  You can  also  pass  in  a
       snippet of gnuplot command, as either a string or an array ref -- but those techniques are deprecated and
       may disappear in a future version of "PDL:Graphics::Gnuplot".

       The keywords are case-insensitive and may be abbreviated, just as with other option types.  They are:

       • axis - set to 1 to place tics on the axis (the default)

       • border - set to 1 to place tics on the border (not the default)

       • mirror  - set to 1 to place mirrored tics on the opposite axis/border (the default, unless an alternate
         axis interferes -- e.g. y2)

       • in - set to 1 to draw tics inward from the axis/border

       • out - set to 1 to draw tics outward from the axis/border

       • scale - multiplier on tic length compared to the default

         If you pass in undef, tics get the default length.  If you pass in a scalar,  major  tics  get  scaled.
         You can pass in an array ref to scale minor tics too.

       • rotate - turn label text by the given angle (in degrees) on the drawing plane

       • offset  -  offset  label  text from default position, (units: characters; requires array ref containing
         x,y)

       • locations - sets tic locations.  Gets an array ref: [incr], [start, incr], or [start, incr, stop].

       • labels - sets tic locations explicitly, with text labels for each. If you specify both "locations"  and
         "labels", you get both sets of tics on the same axis.

         The  labels  should  be  a  nested  array  ref that is a collection of duals or triplets.  Each dual or
         triplet       should       contain       [label,       position,        minorflag],        as        in
         "labels=&gt;[["one",1,0],["three-halves",1.5,1],["two",2,0]]".

       • format  -  printf-style  format string for tic labels.  There are some extensions to the gnuplot format
         tags -- see the gnuplot manual.  Gnuplot 4.8 and higher have %h, which works like %g but uses  extended
         text formatting if it is available.

       • font - set font name and size (system font name)

       • rangelimited - set to 1 to limit tics to the range of values actually present in the plot

       • textcolor - set the color of the tick labels (see "Color specification")

       For example, to turn on inward mirrored X axis ticks with diagonal Arial 9 text, use:

        xtics =&gt; {axis=&gt;1,mirror=&gt;1,in=&gt;1,rotate=&gt;45,font=&gt;'Arial,9'}

       or

        xtics =&gt; ['axis','mirror','in','rotate by 45','font "Arial,9"']

   <b>POs</b> <b>for</b> <b>time</b> <b>data</b> <b>values</b>
       The options described here are

       xmtics
       x2mtics
       ymtics
       y2mtics
       zmtics
       cbmtics
       xdtics
       x2dtics
       ydtics

       xdata
       x2data

       cbdata

       Gnuplot  contains  support  for  plotting  absolute  time  and date on any of its axes, with conventional
       formatting. There are three main methods, which are mutually exclusive (i.e. you should  not  attempt  to
       use two at once on the same axis).

       <b>Plotting</b> <b>timestamps</b> <b>using</b> <b>UNIX</b> <b>times</b>
          You can set any axis to plot timestamps rather than numeric values by setting the corresponding "data"
          plot  option  to "time", e.g. "xdata=&gt;"time"".  If you do so, then numeric values in the corresponding
          data are interpreted as UNIX time (seconds  since  the  UNIX  epoch,  neglecting  leap  seconds).   No
          provision is made for UT"-"TAI conversion.  You can format how the times are plotted with the "format"
          option  in  the various "tics" options(above).  Output specifiers should be in UNIX <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3) format
          -- for example, "xdata=&gt;"time",xtics=&gt;{format=&gt;"%Y-%b-%dT%H:%M:%S"}"  will  plot  UNIX  times  as  ISO
          timestamps in the ordinate.

          Due  to  limitations  within gnuplot, the time resolution in this mode is limited to 1 second - if you
          want fractional seconds, you must use numerically formatted times (and/or create your own tick  labels
          using the "labels" suboption to the "?tics" option.

          <b>Timestamp</b> <b>format</b> <b>specifiers</b>

          Time format specifiers use the following printf-like codes:

          •  <b>Year</b> <b>A.D.</b>: %Y is 4-digit year; %y is 2-digit year (1969-2068)

          •  <b>Month</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b>: %m: 01-12; %b or %h: abrev. name; %B: full name

          •  <b>Week</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b>: %W (week starting Monday); %U (week starting Sunday)

          •  <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b>: %j (1-366; boundary is midnight)

          •  <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>month</b>: %d (01-31)

       <b>day-of-week</b> <b>plotting</b>
          If  you just want to plot named days of the week, you can instead use the "dtics" options set plotting
          to day of week, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday; values are interpreted modulo  7.   For  example,
          "xmtics=&gt;1,xrange=&gt;[-4,9]"  will  plot  two weeks from Wednesday to Wednesday. As far as output format
          goes, this is exactly equivalent to using the %w option with full formatting - but you can  treat  the
          numeric range in terms of weeks rather than seconds.

       <b>month-of-year</b> <b>plotting</b>
          The  "mtics"  options  set  plotting  to months of the year, where 1 is January and 12 is December, so
          "xdtics=&gt;1, xrange=&gt;[0,4]" will include Christmas through Easter.  This is exactly equivalent to using
          the %d option with full formatting - but you can treat the numeric range in  terms  of  months  rather
          than seconds.

   <b>POs</b> <b>for</b> <b>location/size</b>
       The options described here are

       tmargin
       bmargin
       lmargin
       rmargin
       offsets
       origin
       size
       justify
       clip

       Adjusting  the  size,  location,  and  margins of the plot on the plotting surface is something of a null
       operation for most single plots -- but you can tweak the placement  and  size  of  the  plot  with  these
       options.   That  is  particularly useful for multiplots, where you might like to make an inset plot or to
       lay out a set of plots in a custom way.

       The margin options accept scalar values -- either a positive number of character  heights  or  widths  of
       margin around the plot compared to the edge of the device window, or a string that starts with "at screen
       " and interpolates a number containing the fraction of the plot window offset.  The "at screen" technique
       allows exact plot placement and is an alternative to the "origin" and "size" options below.

       The  "offsets" option allows you to put an empty boundary around the data, inside the plot borders, in an
       autosacaled graph.  The offsets only affect the x1 and y1 axes, and only in 2D plot commands.   "offsets"
       accepts  an  array  ref  with  four  values for the offsets, which are given in scientific (plotted) axis
       units.

       The "origin" option lets you specify the origin (lower left corner) of an individual plot on the plotting
       window.  The coordinates are screen coordinates -- i.e. fraction of the total plotting window.

       The size option lets you adjust the size and aspect ratio of the plot, as an  absolute  fraction  of  the
       plot  window  size.  You feed in fractional ratios, as in "size=&gt;[$xfrac, $yfrac]".  You can also feed in
       some keywords to adjust the aspect ratio of the plot.  The size option overrides any autoscaling that  is
       done  by the auto-layout in multiplot mode, so use with caution -- particularly if you are multiplotting.
       You can use "size" to adjust the aspect ratio of a plot, but this is deprecated in favor of  the  pseudo-
       option "justify".

       "justify"  sets  the scientific aspect ratio of a 2-D plot.  Unity yields a plot with a square scientific
       aspect ratio.  Larger numbers yield taller plots.

       "clip" controls the border between the plotted data and the border of the plot.   There  are  three  clip
       types  supported:    points,  one,  and  two.  You can set them independently by passing in booleans with
       their names: "clip=&gt;[points=&gt;1,two=&gt;0]".

   <b>POs</b> <b>for</b> <b>Color:</b> <b>colorbox,</b> <b>palette,</b> <b>clut,</b> <b>pseudocolor,</b> <b>pc,</b> <b>perceptual,</b> <b>pcp</b>
       Color plots are supported via RGB and pseudocolor.  Plots that use pseudcolor or  grayscale  can  have  a
       "color box" that shows the photometric meaning of the color.

       The  colorbox generally appears when necessary but can be controlled manually with the "colorbox" option.
       "colorbox" accepts a scalar boolean value indicating whether or no to draw a color box, or an  array  ref
       containing additional options.  The options are all, well, optional but must appear in the order given:

       ( vertical | horizontal ) - indicates direction of the gradient in the box
       ( default | user ) - indicates user origin and size
          If  you  specify  "default"  the  colorbox  will  be placed on the right-hand side of the plot; if you
          specify "user", you give the location and size in subsequent arguments:

           colorbox =&gt; [ 'user', 'origin'=&gt;"$x,$y", 'size' =&gt; "$x,$y" ]

       ( front | back ) - draws the colorbox before or after the plot
       ( noborder | bdefault | border &lt;line style&gt; ) - specify border
          The line style is a numeric type as described in the gnuplot manual.

       The "palette" option offers many arguments that  are  not  fully  documented  in  this  version  but  are
       explained in the gnuplot manual.  It offers complete control over the pseudocolor mapping function.

       For  simple  color maps, "clut" gives access to a set of named color maps.  (from "Color Look Up Table").
       A few existing color maps are: "default", "gray", "sepia",  "ocean",  "rainbow",  "heat1",  "heat2",  and
       "wheel".  To see a complete list, specify an invalid table, e.g. "clut=&gt;'xxx'".  "clut" is maintained but
       is  superseded by "pc" and "pcp" (below), which give access to a better variety of color tables, and have
       better support for scientific images.

       "pseudocolor" (synonym "pc") gives access to the color tables built  in  to  the  "PDL::Transform::Color"
       package,  if  that  package  is available.  It takes either a color table name or an array ref which is a
       collection of arguments that get sent to the "PDL::Transform::Color::t_pc" transform  definition  method.
       Sending the empty string or undef will generate a list of allowable color table names.  Many of the color
       tables are "photometric" and will render photometric data correctly without gamma correction.

       "perceptual"  (synonym "pcp") gives the same access to "PDL::Transform::Color" as does "pseudocolor", but
       the "equal-perceptual-difference" scaling is used -- i.e. input values are gamma-corrected by the  module
       so that uniform shifts in numeric value yield approximately uniform perceptual shifts.

       If you use "pseudocolor" or "perceptual", and if "PDL::Transform::Color" can be loaded, then the external
       module  is  used  to  define  a  custom  Gnuplot palette by linear interpolation across 256 values.  That
       palette is then used to translate your monochrome data to a color image.  The Gnuplot output  is  assumed
       to be sRGB.  This is probably OK for most output devices.

   <b>POs</b> <b>for</b> <b>3D:</b> <b>trid,</b> <b>view,</b> <b>pm3d,</b> <b>hidden3d,</b> <b>dgrid3d,</b> <b>surface,</b> <b>xyplane,</b> <b>mapping</b>
       If  "trid"  or its synonym "3d" is true, Gnuplot renders a 3-D plot.  This changes the default tuple size
       from 2 to 3.  This option is used to switch between the Gnuplot "plot" and "splot"  command,  but  it  is
       tracked with persistent state just as any other option.

       The  "view"  option  controls the viewpoint of the 3-D plot.  It takes a list of numbers: "view=&gt;[$rot_x,
       $rot_z, $scale, $scale_z]".  After each  number,  you  can  omit  the  subsequent  ones.   Alternatively,
       "view=&gt;['map']" represents the drawing as a map (e.g. for contour plots) and "view=&gt;[equal=&gt;'xy']" forces
       equal  length  scales  on  the  X and Y axes regardless of perspective, while "view=&gt;[equal=&gt;'xyz']" sets
       equal length scales on all three axes.

       The "pm3d" option accepts several parameters to control the pm3d plot style, which is a palette-mapped 3d
       surface.  They are not documented here in this version of the module but are  explained  in  the  gnuplot
       manual.

       "hidden3d"  accepts  a  list  of parameters to control how hidden surfaces are plotted (or not) in 3D. It
       accepts a boolean argument indicating whether to hide "hidden"  surfaces  and  lines;  or  an  array  ref
       containing  parameters  that  control  how  hidden  surfaces  and lines are handled.  For details see the
       gnuplot manual.

       "xyplane" sets the location of that plane (which is drawn) relative to the rest of the plot  in  3-space.
       It  takes  a single string: "at" or "relative", and a number.  "xyplane=&gt;[at=&gt;$z]" places the XY plane at
       the stated Z value (in scientific units) on the plot.  "xyplane=&gt;[relative=&gt;$frac]" places the  XY  plane
       $frac  times  the  length  of the scaled Z axis *below* the Z axis (i.e. 0 places it at the bottom of the
       plotted Z axis; and -1 places it at the top of the plotted Z axis).

       "mapping" takes  a  single  string:  "cartesian",  "spherical",  or  "cylindrical".   It  determines  the
       interpretation of data coordinates in 3-space. (Compare to the "polar" option in 2-D).

   <b>POs</b> <b>for</b> <b>Contour</b> <b>plots</b> <b>-</b> <b>contour,</b> <b>cntrparam</b>
       Contour  plots  are  only implemented in 3D.  To make a normal 2D contour plot, use 3-D mode, but set the
       view to "map" - which projects the 3-D plot onto its 2-D XY plane.  (This  is  convoluted,  for  sure  --
       future versions of this module may have a cleaner way to do it).

       "contour"  enables  contour drawing on surfaces in 3D.  It takes a single string, which should be "base",
       "surface", or "both".

       "cntrparam" manages how contours are generated and smoothed.  It accepts an array ref with  a  collection
       of Gnuplot parameters that are issued one per line; refer to the Gnuplot manual for how to operate it.

   <b>POs</b> <b>for</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>plots</b> <b>-</b> <b>polar,</b> <b>angles,</b> <b>mapping</b>
       You  can make 2-D polar plots by setting "polar" to a true value.  The ordinate is then plotted as angle,
       and the abscissa is radius on the plot.  The ordinate can be in either radians or degrees,  depending  on
       the "angles" parameter

       "angles" takes either "degrees" or "radians" (default is radians).

       "mapping"  is  used  to  set  3-D  polar  plots,  either cylindrical or spherical (see the section on 3-D
       plotting, above).

   <b>POs</b> <b>for</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>-</b> <b>label,</b> <b>arrow,</b> <b>object</b>
       You specify plot markup in advance of the plot command, with plot options  (or  add  it  later  with  the
       "replot" method).  The options give you access to a collection of (separately) numbered descriptions that
       are  accumulated  into  the plot object.  To add a markup object to the next plot, supply the appropriate
       options as an array ref or as a single string.  To  specify  all  markup  objects  at  once,  supply  the
       appropriate options for all of them as a nested list-of-lists.

       To modify an object, you can specify it by number, either by appending the number to the plot option name
       (e.g. "arrow3") or by supplying it as the first element of the option list for that object.

       To remove all objects of a given type, supply undef (e.g. "arrow=&gt;undef").

       For example, to place two labels, use the plot option:

        label =&gt; [["Upper left",at=&gt;"10,10"],["lower right",at=&gt;"20,5"]];

       To add a label to an existing plot object, if you don't care about what index number it gets, do this:

        $w-&gt;options( label=&gt;["my new label",at=&gt;[10,20]] );

       If you do care what index number it gets (or want to replace an existing label), do this:

        $w-&gt;options( label=&gt;[$n, "my replacement label", at=&gt;"10,20"] );

       where $w is a Gnuplot object and $n contains the label number you care about.

       <u>label</u> <u>-</u> <u>add</u> <u>a</u> <u>text</u> <u>label</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>plot.</u>

       The "label" option allows adding small bits of text at arbitrary locations on the plot.

       Each  label  specifier array ref accepts the following suboptions, in order.  All of them are optional --
       if no options other than the index tag are given, then any existing label with that index is deleted.

       For examples, please refer to the Gnuplot 4.4 manual, p. 117.

       &lt;tag&gt; - optional index number (integer)
       &lt;label text&gt; - text to place on the plot.
          You may supply double-quotes inside the string, but it is not necessary in most  cases  (only  if  the
          string contains just an integer and you are not specifying a &lt;tag&gt;.

       at &lt;position&gt; - where to place the text (sci. coordinates)
          The  &lt;position&gt;  should  be  a  string  containing a gnuplot position specifier.  At its simplest, the
          position is just two numbers separated by a comma, as in "label2=&gt;["foo",at=&gt;"5,3"]", to specify (X,Y)
          location on the plot in scientific coordinates.  Each number can be preceded by  a  coordinate  system
          specifier; see the Gnuplot 4.4 manual (page 20) for details.

       ( left | center | right ) - text placement rel. to position
       rotate [ by &lt;degrees&gt; ] - text rotation
          If "rotate" appears in the list alone, then the label is rotated 90 degrees CCW (bottom-to-top instead
          of left-to-right).  The following "by" clause is optional.

       font "&lt;name&gt;,&lt;size&gt;" - font specifier
          The &lt;name&gt;,&lt;size&gt; must be double quoted in the string (this may be fixed in a future version), as in

           label3=&gt;["foo",at=&gt;"3,4",font=&gt;'"Helvetica,18"']

       noenhanced - turn off gnuplot enhanced text processing (if enabled)
       ( front | back ) - rendering order (last or first)
       textcolor &lt;colorspec&gt;
       (point &lt;pointstyle&gt; | nopoint ) - control whether the exact position is marked
       offset &lt;offset&gt; - offfset from position (in points).

       <u>arrow</u> <u>-</u> <u>place</u> <u>an</u> <u>arrow</u> <u>or</u> <u>callout</u> <u>line</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>plot</u>

       Works similarly to the "label" option, but with an arrow instead of text.

       The arguments, all of which are optional but which must be given in the order listed, are:

       from &lt;position&gt; - start of arrow line
          The  &lt;position&gt;  should  be  a  string  containing a gnuplot position specifier.  At its simplest, the
          position is just two numbers separated by a comma, as in "arrow2=&gt;["foo",at=&gt;"5,3"]", to specify (X,Y)
          location on the plot in scientific coordinates.  Each number can be preceded by  a  coordinate  system
          specifier; see the Gnuplot 4.4 manual (page 20) for details.

       ( to | rto ) &lt;position&gt;  - end of arrow line
          These  work  like  "from".   For  absolute  placement, use "to".  For placement relative to the "from"
          position, use "rto".

       (arrowstyle | as) &lt;arrow_style&gt;
          This specifies that the arrow be drawn in a particular predeclared numerical style.  If you give  this
          parameter, you should omit all the following ones.

       ( nohead | head | backhead | heads ) - specify arrowhead placement
       size &lt;length&gt;,&lt;angle&gt;,&lt;backangle&gt; - specify arrowhead geometry
       ( filled | empty | nofilled ) - specify arrowhead fill
       ( front | back ) - specify drawing order ( last | first )
       linestyle &lt;line_style&gt; - specify a numeric linestyle
       linetype &lt;line_type&gt; - specify numeric line type
       linewidth &lt;line_width&gt; - multiplier on the width of the line

       <u>object</u> <u>-</u> <u>place</u> <u>a</u> <u>shape</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>graph</u>

       "object"s  are  rectangles, ellipses, circles, or polygons that can be placed arbitrarily on the plotting
       plane.

       The arguments, all of which are optional but which must be given in the order listed, are:

       &lt;object-type&gt; &lt;object-properties&gt; - type name of the shape and its type-specific properties
          The &lt;object-type&gt; is one of four words: "rectangle", "ellipse", "circle", or "polygon".

          You can specify a rectangle with "from=&gt;$pos1, [r]to=&gt;$pos2", with "center=&gt;$pos1, size=&gt;"$w,$h"",  or
          with "at=&gt;$pos1,size=&gt;"$w,$h"".

          You  can  specify an ellipse with "at=&gt;$pos, size=&gt;"$w,$h"" or "center=&gt;$pos, size=&gt;"$w,$h"", followed
          by "angle=&gt;$a".

          You can specify a  circle  with  "at=&gt;$pos,"  or  "center=&gt;$pos,",  followed  by  "size=&gt;$radius"  and
          (optionally) "arc=&gt;"[$begin:$end]"".

          You    can   specify   a   polygon   with   "from=&gt;$pos1,to=&gt;$pos2,to=&gt;$pos3,...to=&gt;$posn"   or   with
          "from=&gt;$pos1,rto=&gt;$diff1,rto=&gt;$diff2,...rto=&gt;$diffn".

       ( front | back | behind ) - draw the object last | first | really-first.
       fc &lt;colorspec&gt; - specify fill color
       fs &lt;fillstyle&gt; - specify fill style
       lw &lt;width&gt; - multiplier on line width

   <b>POs</b> <b>for</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>tweaks</b> <b>-</b> <b>bars,</b> <b>boxwidth,</b> <b>isosamples,</b> <b>pointsize,</b> <b>style</b>
       <b>"bars"</b> sets the width and behavior of the tick marks at  the  ends  of  error  bars.   It  takes  a  list
       containing at most two elements, both of which are optional:

       •  A width specifier, which should be a numeric size multiplier times the usual width (which is about one
          character width in the default font size), or the word "fullwidth" to make the ticks the same width as
          their associated boxes in boxplots and histograms.

       •  the  word  "front"  or  "back" to indicate drawing order in plots that might contain filled rectangles
          (e.g. boxes, candlesticks, or histograms).

       If you pass in the undefined value you get no ticks on errorbars; if you pass in the empty array ref  you
       get default ticks.

       <b>"boxwidth"</b>  sets  the  width  of  drawn boxes in boxplots, candlesticks, and histograms.  It takes a list
       containing at most two elements:

       •  a numeric width

       •  one of the words "absolute" or "relative".

       Unless you set "relative", the numeric width sets the width of boxes in X-axis scientific units  (on  log
       scales,  this is measured at x=1 and the same width is used throughout the plot plane).  If "relative" is
       included, the numeric width is taken to be a multiplier on the default width.

       <b>"isosamples"</b> sets isoline density for plotting functions as surfaces.  You supply  one  or  two  numbers.
       The  first is the number of iso-u lines and the second is the number of iso-v lines.  If you only specify
       one, then the two are taken  to  be  the  same.   From  the  gnuplot  manual:  "An  isoline  is  a  curve
       parameterized  by  one  of  the  surface parameters while the other surface parameter is fixed.  Isolines
       provide a simple means to display a surface.  By fixing the u parameter  of  surface  s(u,v),  the  iso-u
       lines of the form c(v) = s(u0,v) are produced, and by fixing the v parameter, the iso-v lines of the form
       c(u)=s(u,v0) are produced".

       <b>"pointsize"</b> accepts a single number and scales the size of points used in plots.

       <b>"style"</b>  provides a great deal of customization for individual plot styles.  It is not (yet) fully parsed
       by PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot; please refer to the Gnuplot manual for details (it is pp. 145ff in the Gnuplot
       4.6.1 manual).  "style" accepts a hash ref whose keys are plot styles (such as  you  would  feed  to  the
       "with"  curve option), and whose values are array refs containing keywords and other parameters to modify
       how each plot style should be displayed.

   <b>POs</b> <b>for</b> <b>locale/internationalization</b> <b>-</b> <b>locale,</b> <b>decimalsign</b>
       "locale" is used to control date stamp creation.  See the gnuplot manual.

       "decimalsign"  accepts a character to use in lieu of a  "."  for  the  decimalsign.   (e.g.  in  European
       countries use "decimalsign=&gt;','").

       "globalwith"  is  used  as  a  default  plot style if no valid 'with' curve option is present for a given
       curve.

       If set to a nonzero value, "timestamp" causes a time stamp to be placed on the side of the plot, e.g. for
       keeping track of drafts.

       "zero" sets the approximation threshold for zero values within gnuplot.  Its default is 1e-8.

       "fontpath" sets a font search path for gnuplot.  It accepts a collection of file names as an array ref.

   <b>POs</b> <b>for</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>Gnuplot</b> <b>tweaks:</b> <b>topcmds,</b> <b>extracmds,</b> <b>bottomcmds,</b> <b>binary,</b> <b>dump,</b> <b>tee</b>
       Plotting is carried out by sending a collection  of  commands  to  an  underlying  gnuplot  process.   In
       general,  the  plot  options cause "set" commands to be sent, configuring gnuplot to make the plot; these
       are followed by a "plot" or "splot" command and by any cleanup that is necessary to  keep  gnuplot  in  a
       known state.

       Provisions  exist  for  sending commands directly to Gnuplot as part of a plot.  You can send commands at
       the top of the configuration but just under the initial "set terminal" and "set  output"  commands  (with
       the  "topcmds"  option),  at the bottom of the configuration and just before the "plot" command (with the
       "extracmds" option), or after the plot command (with  the  "bottomcmds"  option).   Each  of  these  plot
       options takes an array ref, each element of which should be one command line for gnuplot.

       Most  plotting  is done with binary data transfer to Gnuplot; however, due to some bugs in Gnuplot binary
       handling, certain types of plot data are sent in ASCII.   In  particular,  time  series  and  label  data
       require  transmission  in  ASCII  (as of Gnuplot 4.4).  You can force ASCII transmission of all but image
       data by explicitly setting the "binary=&gt;0" option.

       "dump" is used for debugging. If true, it writes out the gnuplot commands to STDOUT <u>instead</u> of writing to
       a gnuplot process. Useful to see what commands would be sent to gnuplot. This is a dry run. Note that  if
       the  'binary'  option  is given (see below), then this dump will contain binary data. If this binary data
       should be suppressed from the dump, set "dump =&gt; 'nobinary'".

       "tee" is used for debugging. If true, writes out the gnuplot commands to STDERR <u>in</u> <u>addition</u> to writing to
       a gnuplot process. This is <u>not</u> a dry run: data is sent to gnuplot <u>and</u> to the log.  Useful  for  debugging
       I/O  issues.  Note  that  if  the 'binary' option is given (see below), then this log will contain binary
       data. If this binary data should be suppressed from the log, set tee =&gt; 'nobinary'.

</pre><h4><b>CURVE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The curve options describe details of specific curves within a plot.  They are in a hash, whose keys  are
       as follows:

       legend
         Specifies the legend label for this curve

       axes
         Lets you specify which X and/or Y axes to plot on.  Gnuplot supports a main and alternate X and Y axis.
         You specify them as a packed string with the x and y axes indicated: for example, "x1y1" to plot on the
         main  axes,  or  "x1y2"  to  plot  using an alternate Y axis (normally gridded on the right side of the
         plot).

       with
         Specifies the plot style for this curve. The value is passed to gnuplot using its  'with'  keyword,  so
         valid  values  are  whatever  gnuplot  supports.   See  above  ("Plot  styles supported") for a list of
         supported curve styles.

         The following curve options in this list modify the plot style further.  Not all of them are applicable
         to all plot styles -- for example, it makes no sense to specify a fill style for "with=&gt;lines".

         For historical reasons, you can supply the with modifier curve options as a single string in the "with"
         curve  option.   That  usage  is   deprecated   and   will   disappear   in   a   future   version   of
         PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot.

       linetype (abbrev 'lt')
         This is a numeric selector from the default collection of line styles.  It includes automagic selection
         of dash style, color, and width from the default set of linetypes for your current output terminal.

       dashtype (abbrev 'dt')
         This is can be either a numeric type selector (0 for no dashes) or an ARRAY ref containing a list of up
         to  5  pairs of (dash length, space length).  The "dashtype" curve option is only supported for Gnuplot
         versions 5.0 and above.

         If you don't specify a "dashtype" curve option, the default behavior matches the  behavior  of  earlier
         gnuplots:  many  terminals  support  a "dashed" terminal/output option, and if you have set that option
         (with the constructor or with the "output" method) then lines are uniquely dashed by default.  To  make
         a  single  curve  solid, specify "dt=&gt;0" as a curve option for it; or to make all curves solid, use the
         constructor or the "output" method to set the terminal option "dashed=&gt;0".

         If your gnuplot is older than v5.0, the dashtype curve option is ignored (and causes a  warning  to  be
         emitted).

       linestyle (abbrev 'ls')
         This  works exactly like "linetype" above, except that you can modify individual line styles by setting
         the "style line &lt;num&gt;" plot option.  That is handy for a custom style  you  might  use  across  several
         curves either a single plot or several plots.

       linewidth (abbrev 'lw')
         This is a numeric multiplier on the usual default line width in your current terminal.

       linecolor (abbrev 'lc')
         This  is  a  color  specifier for the color of the line.  See "Color specification".  You can feed in a
         standard     color     name     (they're      listed      in      the      package-global      variable
         @PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot::colornames),  a  small integer to index the standard linetype colors, the word
         "variable" to indicate that the line color is a standard linetype color to be drawn from an  additional
         column  of  data,  a  string  of  the  form  #RRGGBB, where the # is literal and the RR, GG, and BB are
         hexadecimal bytes, the words "rgbcolor variable" to specify an additional  column  of  data  containing
         24-bit  packed integers with RGB color values, "[palette=&gt;'frac',&lt;val&gt;]" to specify a single fractional
         position (scaled 0-1) in the current palette, or "[palette=&gt;'cb',&lt;val&gt;]" to specify a single  value  in
         the scaled cbrange.

         There  is  no  "linecolor=&gt;[palette=&gt;variable]"  due  to Gnuplot's non-orthogonal syntax.  To draw line
         color from the palette, via an additional data column, see the separate "palette" curve option (below).

       textcolor (abbrev 'tc')
         For plot styles like "labels" that specify text, this sets the color of the  text.   It  has  the  same
         format as "linecolor" (above).

       pointtype (abbrev 'pt')
         Selects  a  point glyph shape from the built-in list for your terminal, for plots that render points as
         small glyphs (like "points" and "linespoints").

       pointsize (abbrev 'ps')
         Selects a fractional size for point glyphs, relative to the default size on your  terminal,  for  plots
         that render points as small glyphs.

       fillcolor (abbrev 'fc')
         Fills  an area plot like "filledcurves" with a color.  It has the same format as "linecolor". This will
         fill the whole plot with the same color. To fill above a threshold or below a threshold,  you  need  to
         use "above" and "below" options.

         An example to plot data in a single function call is below:

             plot({ with =&gt; 'filledcurves', fillcolor =&gt; 'green', above =&gt; 'y=0' },
                 x, y,
                 { with =&gt; 'filledcurves', fillcolor =&gt; 'red', below =&gt; 'y=0' },
                 x, y);

       below
         This  is  used  for  "filledcurves" to set a "fillcolor" below a threshold.  You can set the value like
         "y=0" if you want to color below the Y-axis value of 0.

       above
         This is used for "filledcurves" to set a "fillcolor" above a threshold.  You can  set  the  value  like
         "y=0" if you want to color above the Y-axis value of 0.

       fillstyle (abbrev 'fs')
         Specify  the  way  that  filled  regions  should  be  colored,  in plots that have fillable areas (like
         "boxes").  Unlike "linestyle" above, "fillstyle" accepts a full specification rather than an index into
         a set of predefined styles. You can feed in: 'empty' for no fill; 'transparent solid &lt;density&gt;'  for  a
         solid  fill  with  optional  &lt;density&gt;  from  0.0 to 1.0 (default 1.0); 'transparent pattern &lt;n&gt;' for a
         pattern fill--plotting multiple datasets causes the pattern to  cycle  through  all  available  pattern
         types,  starting  from  pattern &lt;n&gt; (be aware that the default &lt;n&gt;=0 may be equivalent to 'empty'); The
         'transparent' portions of the strings are optional, and are only effective on  terminals  that  support
         transparency.  Be aware that the quality of the visual output may depend on terminal type and rendering
         software.

         Any of those fill style specification strings can have a border specification string  appended  to  it.
         To  specify  a border, append 'border', and then optionally either 'lt=&gt;&lt;type&gt;' or 'lc=&gt;&lt;colorspec&gt;' to
         the string.  To specify no border, append 'noborder'.

       nohidden3d
         If you are making a 3D plot and have used the plot option "hidden3d" to get hidden  line  removal,  you
         can  override that for a particular curve by setting the "nohidden3d" option to a true value.  Only the
         single curve with "nohidden3d" set will have its hidden points rendered.

       nocontours
         If you are making a contour 3D plot, you can inhibit rendering of contours for a  particular  curve  by
         setting "nocontours" to a true value.

       nosurface
         If  you  are  making  a  surface  3D  plot,  you can inhibit rendering of the surface associated with a
         particular curve, by setting "nosurface" to a true value.

       palette
         Setting "palette =&gt; 1" causes line color to be drawn from an additional column in the data tuple.  This
         column is always the very last column in the  tuple,  in  case  of  conflict  (e.g.  if  you  set  both
         "pointsize=&gt;variable"  and  "palette=&gt;1",  then the palette column is the last column and the pointsize
         column is second-to-last).

       tuplesize
         Specifies how many values represent each data point.  Normally you don't need to set this as individual
         "with" styles implicitly set a tuple size (which is automatically extended if  you  specify  additional
         modifiers   such   as   "palette"   that   require   more   data);   this   option  lets  you  override
         PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot's parsing in case of irregularity.

       cdims
         Specifies the dimensions of of each column in this curve's tuple.  It must be 0, 1,  or  2.    Normally
         you  don't  need  to  set  this for most plots; the main use is to specify that a 2-D data PDL is to be
         interpreted as a collection of 1-D columns rather than a single 2-D grid (which would be the default in
         a 3-D plot). For example:

             $w=gpwin();
             $r2 = rvals(21,21)**2;
             $w-&gt;plot3d( wi=&gt;'lines', xvals($r2), yvals($r2), $r2 );

         will produce a grid of values on a paraboloid. To instead plot a collection of lines using the threaded
         syntax, try

             $w-&gt;plot3d( wi=&gt;'lines', cd=&gt;1, xvals($r2), yvals($r2), $r2 );

         which will plot 21 separate curves in a threaded manner.

       resample
         For "with=&gt;'fits'". See "Images".

       Most of these come directly from Gnuplot commands. See the Gnuplot docs for details.

   <b>2D</b> <b>plotting</b>
       If we're plotting an ndarray $y of y-values to be plotted sequentially (implicit domain), all you need is

         gplot($y);

       If we also have a corresponding $x domain, we can plot $y vs. $x with

         gplot($x, $y);

       <u>Simple</u> <u>style</u> <u>control</u>

       To change line thickness:

         gplot(with =&gt; 'lines',linewidth=&gt;4, $x, $y);
         gplot(with =&gt; 'lines', lw=&gt;4, $x, $y);

       To change point size and point type:

         gplot(with =&gt; 'points',pointtype=&gt;8, $x, $y);
         gplot(with =&gt; 'points',pt=&gt;8, $x, $y);

       <u>Errorbars</u>

       To plot errorbars that show $y +- 1, plotted with an implicit domain

         gplot(with =&gt; 'yerrorbars', $y, $y-&gt;ones);

       Same with an explicit $x domain:

         gplot(with =&gt; 'yerrorbars', $x, $y, $y-&gt;ones);

       Symmetric errorbars on both x and y. $x +- 1, $y +- 2:

         gplot(with =&gt; 'xyerrorbars', $x, $y, $x-&gt;ones, 2*$y-&gt;ones);

       To plot asymmetric errorbars that show the range $y-1 to $y+2 (note that here you must specify the actual
       errorbar-end positions, NOT just their deviations from the center; this is how Gnuplot does it)

         gplot(with =&gt; 'yerrorbars', $y, $y - $y-&gt;ones, $y + 2*$y-&gt;ones);

       <u>More</u> <u>multi-value</u> <u>styles</u>

       Plotting with variable-size circles (size given in plot units, requires Gnuplot &gt;= 4.4)

         gplot(with =&gt; 'circles', $x, $y, $radii);

       Plotting with a variably-sized arbitrary point type (size given in multiples of the "default" point size)

         gplot(with =&gt; 'points', pointtype=&gt;7, pointsize=&gt;'variable',
               $x, $y, $sizes);

       Color-coded points

         gplot(with =&gt; 'points', palette=&gt;1,
               $x, $y, $colors);

       Variable-size AND color-coded circles. A Gnuplot (4.4.0) bug make it necessary to specify the color range
       here

         gplot(cbmin =&gt; $mincolor, cbmax =&gt; $maxcolor,
               with =&gt; 'circles', palette=&gt;1,
               $x, $y, $radii, $colors);

   <b>3D</b> <b>plotting</b>
       General style control works identically for 3D plots as in 2D plots.

       To plot a set of 3d points, with a square aspect ratio (squareness requires Gnuplot &gt;= 4.4):

         splot(square =&gt; 1, $x, $y, $z);

       If $xy is a 2D ndarray, we can plot it as a height map on an implicit domain

         splot($xy);

       Complicated 3D plot with fancy styling:

         my $pi    = 3.14159;
         my $theta = <a href="../man200/zeros.200.html">zeros</a>(200)-&gt;xlinvals(0, 6*$pi);
         my $z     = <a href="../man200/zeros.200.html">zeros</a>(200)-&gt;xlinvals(0, 5);

         splot(title =&gt; 'double helix',

               { with =&gt; 'linespoints',
                 pointsize=&gt;'variable',
                 pointtype=&gt;7,
                 palette=&gt;1,
                 legend =&gt; 'spiral 1' },
               { legend =&gt; 'spiral 2' },

               # 2 sets of x, 2 sets of y, single z
               PDL::cat( cos($theta), -cos($theta)),
               PDL::cat( sin($theta), -sin($theta)),
               $z,

               # pointsize, color
               0.5 + abs(cos($theta)), sin(2*$theta) );

       3D plots can be plotted as a heat map.

         splot( extracmds =&gt; 'set view 0,0',
                with =&gt; 'image',
                $xy );

   <b>Hardcopies</b>
       To send any plot to a file, instead of to the screen, one can simply do

         gplot(hardcopy =&gt; 'output.pdf',
               $x, $y);

       The "hardcopy" option is a shorthand for the "terminal" and "output" options. The output device is chosen
       from the file name suffix.

       If you want more (any) control over the output options (e.g. page size, font, etc.) then you can  specify
       the  output  device  using  the  "output"  method  or the constructor itself -- or the corresponding plot
       options in the non-object mode. For example, to generate a PDF of a particular  size  with  a  particular
       font size for the text, one can do

         gplot(terminal =&gt; 'pdfcairo solid color font ",10" size 11in,8.5in',
               output   =&gt; 'output.pdf',
               $x, $y);

       This  command  is  equivalent to the "hardcopy" shorthand used previously, but the fonts and sizes can be
       changed.

       Using the object oriented mode, you could instead say:

         $w = gpwin();
         $w-&gt;plot( $x, $y );
         $w-&gt;output( pdfcairo, solid=&gt;1, color=&gt;1,font=&gt;',10',size=&gt;[11,8.5,'in'] );
         $w-&gt;replot();
         $w-&gt;close();

       Many hardcopy output terminals (such as "pdf" and "svg") will not dump their plot to the file unless  the
       file  is  explicitly  closed  with a change of output device or a call to "reset", "restart", or "close".
       This is because those devices support multipage output and also require an end-of-file  marker  to  close
       the file.

</pre><h4><b>Plotting</b> <b>examples</b></h4><pre>
   <b>A</b> <b>simple</b> <b>example</b>
          my $win = gpwin('x11');
          $win-&gt;plot( sin(<a href="../man45/xvals.45.html">xvals</a>(45)) * 3.14159/10 );

       Here we just plot a simple function.  The default plot style is a line.  Line plots take a 2-tuple (X and
       Y  values).   Since we have supplied only one element, plot() understands it to be the Y value (abscissa)
       of the plot, and supplies value indices as X values -- so we get a plot of just over 2 cycles of the sine
       wave over an X range across X values from 0 to 44.

   <b>A</b> <b>not-so-simple</b> <b>example</b>
          $win = gpwin('x11');
          $pi = 3.14159;
          $win-&gt;plot( {with =&gt; line}, <a href="../man10/xvals.10.html">xvals</a>(10)**2, <a href="../man10/xvals.10.html">xvals</a>(10),
                      {with =&gt; circles}, 2 * <a href="../man50/xvals.50.html">xvals</a>(50), 2 * sin(<a href="../man50/xvals.50.html">xvals</a>(50) * $pi / 10), <a href="../man50/xvals.50.html">xvals</a>(50)/20
           );

       This plots sqrt(x) in an interesting way, and overplots some circles of  varying  size.   The  line  plot
       accepts a 2-tuple, and we supply both X and Y.  The circles plot accepts a 3-tuple: X, Y, and R.

   <b>A</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>example:</b>
          $pi    = 3.14159;
          $theta = <a href="../man201/xvals.201.html">xvals</a>(201) * 6 * $pi / 200;
          $z     = <a href="../man201/xvals.201.html">xvals</a>(201) * 5 / 200;

          gplot( {trid =&gt; 1, title =&gt; 'double helix',cbr=&gt;[0,1]},
                {with =&gt; 'linespoints',
                 pointsize=&gt;'variable',
                 pointtype=&gt;2,
                 palette=&gt;1,
                 legend =&gt; ['spiral 1','spiral 2'],
                 cdim=&gt;1},
                pdl( cos($theta), -cos($theta) ),       # x
                pdl( sin($theta), -sin($theta) ),       # y
                $z,                                     # z
                (0.5 + abs(cos($theta))),               # pointsize
                sin($theta/3),                          # color
                { with=&gt;'points',
                  pointsize=&gt;'variable',
                  pointtype=&gt;5,
                  palette=&gt;0
                },
                <a href="../man6/zeroes.6.html">zeroes</a>(6),                         # x
                <a href="../man6/zeroes.6.html">zeroes</a>(6),                         # y
                <a href="../man6/xvals.6.html">xvals</a>(6),                          # z
                <a href="../man6/xvals.6.html">xvals</a>(6)+1                         # point size
          );

       This  is  a  3d plot with variable size and color. There are 5 values in the tuple.  The first 2 ndarrays
       have dimensions (N,2); all the other ndarrays have a single dimension. The "cdim=&gt;1" specifies that  each
       column  of  data  should  be  one-dimensional.  Thus  the PDL threading generates 2 distinct curves, with
       varying values for x,y and identical values for everything else.  To  label  the  curves  differently,  2
       different  sets  of  curve  options are given.  Omitting the "cdim" curve option would yield a 201x2 grid
       with the "linespoints" plotstyle, rather than two separate curves.

       In addition to the threaded pair of linespoints curves, there are six variable  size  points  plotted  as
       filled squares, as a secondary curve.

       Plot  options are passed in in two places:  as a leading hash ref, and as a trailing hash ref.  Any other
       hash elements or hash refs must be curve options.

       Curves are delimited by non-data arguments.  After the initial hash ref,  curve  options  for  the  first
       curve  (the threaded pair of spirals) are passed in as a second hash ref.  The curve's data arguments are
       ended by the first non-data argument (the hash ref with the curve options for the second curve).

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>gpwin</b>
        use PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot;
        $w = gpwin( @options );
        $w-&gt;plot( @plot_args );

       gpwin is the PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot exported constructor.  It is exported by default and is a synonym for
       "new PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot(...)".  If given no arguments, it creates a  plot  object  with  the  default
       terminal  settings  for  your  gnuplot.   You  can also give it the name of a Gnuplot terminal type (e.g.
       'x11') and some terminal and output options (see "output").

   <b>new</b>
           $w = new PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot;
           $w-&gt;plot( @plot_args );
           #
           # Specify plot options alone
           $w = new PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot( {%plot_options} );
           #
           # Specify device and device options (and optional default plot options)
           $w = new PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot( device, %device_options, {%plot_options} );
           $w-&gt;plot( @plot_args );

       Creates a PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot persistent plot object, and connects it to gnuplot.

       For convenience, you can specify the output device  and  its  options  right  here  in  the  constructor.
       Because  different  gnuplot  devices  accept  different options, you must specify a device if you want to
       specify any device configuration options (such as window size, output file, text mode, or default font).

       If you don't specify a device type, then the Gnuplot default device for your system gets used.   You  can
       set that with an environment variable (check the Gnuplot documentation).

       Gnuplot  uses  the  word  "terminal"  for  output  devices;  you can see a list of terminals supported by
       PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot by invoking PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot::terminfo() (for example in the perldl shell).

       For convenience, you can provide default plot options here.  If the last argument to new() is a  trailing
       hash ref, it is treated as plot options.

       After  you  have  created  an object, you can change its terminal/output device with the "output" method,
       which is useful for (e.g.) throwing up an interactive plot and then sending it to a hardcopy device.  See
       "output" for a description of terminal options and how to format them.

       Normally,  the  object connects to the command "gnuplot" in your path, using the "Alien::Gnuplot" module.
       If you need to specify a binary other than this default, check the "Alien::Gnuplot" documentation.

         my $plot = PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot-&gt;new({title =&gt; 'Object-oriented plot'});
         $plot-&gt;plot( legend =&gt; 'curve', <a href="../man5/sequence.5.html">sequence</a>(5) );

   <b>output</b>
           $window-&gt;output( $device );
           $window-&gt;output( $device, %device_options );
           $window-&gt;output( $device, %device_options, {plot_options} );
           $window-&gt;output( %device_options, {plot_options} );
           $window-&gt;output( %device_options );

       Sets the output device and options for a Gnuplot object. If you omit the $device name, then you  get  the
       gnuplot default device (generally "x11", "wxt", or "aqua", depending on platform).

       You  can  control  the  output device of a PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot object on the fly.  That is useful, for
       example, to replot several versions of the  same  plot  to  different  output  devices  (interactive  and
       hardcopy).

       Gnuplot interprets terminal options differently per device.  PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot attempts to interpret
       some of the more common ones in a common way.  In particular:

       size
          Most  drivers  support a "size" option to specify the size of the output plotting surface.  The format
          is [$width, $height, $unit]; the trailing unit string is optional but recommended, since  the  default
          unit of length changes from device to device.

          The unit string can be in, cm, mm, px, char, or pt.  Pixels are taken to be 1 point in size (72 pixels
          per inch) and dimensions are computed accordingly.  Characters are taken to be 12 point in size (6 per
          inch).

       output
          This  option  actually  sets  the object's "output" option for most terminal devices; that changes the
          file to which the plot will be written.  Some devices, notably X11 and Aqua, don't make proper use  of
          "output";  for  those  devices,  specifying  "output"  in  the  object  constructor  actually sets the
          appropriate terminal option (e.g. "window" in the X11 terminal).  This is described as a "plot option"
          in the Gnuplot manual, but it is treated as a  setup  variable  and  parsed  with  the  setup/terminal
          options here in the constructor.

          If  you  don't  specify  an  output  device,  plots will go to sequentially-numbered files of the form
          "Plot-&lt;n&gt;.&lt;suf&gt;" in your current working directory.  In that case, PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot will  report
          (on STDERR) where the plot ended up.

       enhanced
          This  is  a  flag  that  indicates  whether  to  enable  Gnuplot's  enhanced text processing (e.g. for
          superscripts and subscripts).  Set it to a false value for plain text, to a true  value  for  enhanced
          text (which includes LaTeX-like markup for super/sub scripts and fonts).

       aa For  certain  pixel-grid terminals (currently only "pncairo" and "png", as of v2.012), you can specify
          an antialiasing factor for the output.  The output is rendered oversized by a  factor  of  "aa",  then
          scaled  down using "PDL::Transform".  Fixed font sized, line widths, and point sizes are autoscaled --
          but you must handle variable ones explicitly.

          Antialiasing is done in the gamma=2.2 approximation, to match the sRGB coding that  most  pixel  image
          files use.  (See PDL::Transform::Color for more information).

       For   a  brief  description  of  the  terminal  options  that  any  one  device  supports,  you  can  run
       <b>PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot::terminfo()</b>.

       As with plot options, terminal options can be abbreviated to the shortest  unique  string  --  so  (e.g.)
       "size" can generally be abbreviated "si" and "monochrome" can be abbreviated "mono" or "mo".

   <b>close</b>
         $w=gpwin();
         $w-&gt;plot(<a href="../man5/xvals.5.html">xvals</a>(5));
         $w-&gt;close;

       Close gnuplot process (actually just a synonym for restart)

       Some  of  the  gnuplot terminals (e.g. pdf) don't write out a file promptly.  The close method closes the
       associated gnuplot subprocess, forcing the file to be written out.  It is implemented as a simple restart
       operation.

       The object preserves the plot state, so "replot" and similar methods still work with the new subprocess.

   <b>restart</b>
           $w-&gt;restart();
           PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot::restart();

       Restart the gnuplot backend for a plot object

       Occasionally the gnuplot backend can get into an unknown state.  "restart" kills the gnuplot backend  and
       starts  a  new  one, preserving state in the object.  (i.e. "replot" and similar functions work even with
       the new subprocess).

       Called with no arguments, "restart" applies to the global plot object.

   <b>reset</b>
           $w-&gt;reset()

       Clear state from the gnuplot backend

       Clears all  plot  option  state  from  the  underlying  object.   All  plot  options  except  "terminal",
       "termoptions",  "output",  and "multiplot" are cleared.  This is similar to the "reset" command supported
       by gnuplot itself, and in fact it also causes a "reset" to be sent to gnuplot.

   <b>options</b>
         $w = new PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot();
         $w-&gt;options( globalwith=&gt;'lines' );
         print %{$w-&gt;options()};

       Set/get persistent plot options for a plot object

       The options method parses plot options into a gnuplot object on  a  cumulative  basis,  and  returns  the
       resultant options hash.

       If called as a sub rather than a method, <b>options()</b> changes the global gnuplot object.

   <b>plot_generate</b>
       Called  with the same arguments as "plot", it returns the text that would be sent to Gnuplot. Exportable.
       Added in 2.025.

   <b>gplot</b>
       Plot method exported by default (synonym for "PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot::plot")

   <b>plot</b>
       This is the main plotting routine in PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot.

       Each plot() call creates a new plot from whole cloth, either creating or overwriting the output for  that
       device.

       If you want to add features to an existing plot, use "replot".

       plot() understands the PDL bad value mechanism.  Bad values are omitted from the plot.

        $w=gpwin();
        $w-&gt;plot({temp_plot_options},                 # optional
             curve_options, data, data, ... ,      # curve_options are optional for the first plot
             curve_options, data, data, ... ,
              {temp_plot_options});

       Most of the arguments are optional.

       All of the extensive array of gnuplot plot styles are supported, including images and 3-D plots.

        use PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot qw(plot);
        my $x = <a href="../man101/sequence.101.html">sequence</a>(101) - 50;
        plot($x**2);

       See main POD for PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot for details.

       You can pass plot options into plot as either a leading or trailing hash ref, or both.  If you pass both,
       the trailing hash ref is parsed last and overrides the leading hash.

       For  debugging and curiosity purposes, the last plot command issued to gnuplot is maintained in a package
       global: $PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot::last_plotcmd, and also in each object as the {last_plotcmd} field.

   <b>replot</b>
       Replot the last plot (possibly with new arguments).

       "replot" is similar to gnuplot's "replot" command - it allows you to regenerate the last plot  made  with
       this  object.  You can change the plot by adding new elements to it, modifying options, or even (with the
       "device" method) changing the output device.  "replot" takes the same arguments as "plot".

       If you give no arguments at all (or only a plot object) then the plot is simply  redrawn.   If  you  give
       plot  arguments,  they  are  added to the new plot exactly as if you'd included them in the original plot
       element list, and maintained for subsequent replots.

       (Compare to 'markup').

   <b>markup</b>
       Add ephemeral markup to the last plot.

       "markup" works exactly the same as "replot", except that any new arguments are not added  to  the  replot
       list - so you can add temporary markup to a plot and regenerate the plot later without it.

   <b>plot3d</b>
       Generate 3D plots. Synonym for "plot(trid =&gt; 1, ...)"

   <b>splot</b>
       Generate 3D plots.  Synonym for "plot(trid =&gt; 1, ...)"

   <b>lines</b>
       Generates plots with lines, by default. Shorthand for "plot(globalwith =&gt; 'lines', ...)"

   <b>points</b>
       Generates plots with points, by default. Shorthand for "plot(globalwith =&gt; 'points', ...)"

   <b>image</b>
       Displays an image (either greyscale or RGB).  Shorthand for "plot(globalwith =&gt; 'image', ...)"

   <b>imag</b>
       Synonym for "image", for people who grew up with PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT and can't remember the closing 'e'

   <b>fits</b>
       Displays a FITS image.  Synonym for "plot(globalwith =&gt; 'fits', ...)".

   <b>multiplot_generate</b>
       Called  with the same arguments as "multiplot", it returns the text that would be sent to Gnuplot.  Added
       in 2.025.

   <b>multiplot</b>
        $a = (<a href="../man101/xvals.101.html">xvals</a>(101)/100) * 6 * 3.14159/180;
        $b = sin($a);

        $w-&gt;multiplot(layout=&gt;[2,2,"columnsfirst"]);
        $w-&gt;plot({title=&gt;"points"},with=&gt;"points",$a,$b);
        $w-&gt;plot({title=&gt;"lines"}, with=&gt;"lines", $a,$b);
        $w-&gt;multiplot_next; # with Gnuplot 4.7+
        $w-&gt;plot({title=&gt;"image"}, with=&gt;"image", $a-&gt;(*1) * $b );
        $w-&gt;end_multi();

       Plot multiple plots into a single page of output.

       The "multiplot" method enables multiplot mode in gnuplot, which permits multiple plots on a single  pane.
       Plots  can  be lain out in a grid, or can be lain out freeform using the "size" and "origin" plot options
       for each of the individual plots.

       It is not possible to change the terminal or output device when in multiplot mode; if you try to do that,
       by setting one of those plot options, PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot will throw an error.

       The options hash will accept:

       layout - define a regular grid of plots to multiplot
          "layout" should be followed by an ARRAY ref that contains at least number of columns  ("NX")  followed
          by  number  of  rows  ("NY).   After  that,  you  may  include any of the "rowsfirst", "columnsfirst",
          "downwards", or "upwards" keywords to specify traversal order through the grid.  Only the first letter
          is examined, so (e.g.) "down" or even "dog" works the same as "downwards".

       title - define a title for the entire page
          "title" should be followed by a single scalar containing the title string.

       scale - make gridded plots larger or smaller than their allocated space
          "scale" takes either a scalar or an array ref containing one or two values.   If  only  one  value  is
          supplied,  it  is  a  general  scale factor of each plot in the grid.  If two values are supplied, the
          first is an X stretch factor for each plot in the grid, and the second is a Y stretch factor for  each
          plot in the grid.

       offset - offset each plot from its grid origin
          "offset"  takes  an  array  ref  containing two values, that control placement of each plot within the
          grid.

   <b>multiplot_next_generate</b>
       Called with the same arguments as "multiplot_next", it returns the text that would be  sent  to  Gnuplot.
       Exportable.  Added in 2.025.

   <b>multiplot_next</b>
       Skip one plot. Added in 2.025. Requires Gnuplot 4.7+.

   <b>end_multi_generate</b>
       Called  with  the  same  arguments  as  "end_multi",  it  returns the text that would be sent to Gnuplot.
       Exportable.  Added in 2.025.

   <b>end_multi</b>
        $w=gpwin();
        $w-&gt;multiplot(layout=&gt;[2,1]);
        $w-&gt;plot({title=&gt;"points"},with=&gt;'points',$a,$b);
        $w-&gt;plot({title=&gt;"lines"},with=&gt;"lines",$a,$b);
        $w-&gt;end_multi();

       Ends a multiplot block (i.e. a block of plots that are meant to render to a single page).

   <b>read_mouse</b>
         ($x,$y,$char,$modstring) = $w-&gt;read_mouse($message);
         $hash = $w-&gt;read_mouse($message);

       Get a mouse click or keystroke from the active interactive plot window.

       For interactive devices (e.g. x11, wxt, aqua), read_mouse lets you accept a  keystroke  or  mouse  button
       input  from the gnuplot window.  In list context, it returns four arguments containing the reported X, Y,
       keystroke character, and modifiers packed in a  string.   In  scalar  context,  it  returns  a  hash  ref
       containing those things.

       read_mouse blocks execution for input, but responds gracefully to interrupts.

   <b>read_polygon</b>
         $points = $w-&gt;read_polygon(%opt)

       Read  in  a polygon by accepting mouse clicks.  The polygon is returned as a 2xN PDL of ($x,$y) values in
       scientific units. Acceptable options are:

       message - what to print before collecting points
          There are some printf-style escapes for the prompt:

          * %c - expands to "an open" or "a closed"

          * %n - number of points currently in the polygon

          * %N - number of points expected for the polygon

          * %k - list of all keys accepted

          * "%%" - %

       prompt  - what to print to prompt the user for the next point
          "prompt" uses the same escapes as "message".

       n_points - number of points to accept (or 0 for indefinite)
          With 0 value, points are accepted until the user presses 'q' or 'ESC' on the keyboard  with  focus  on
          the  graph.   With other value, points are accepted until that happens *or* until the number of points
          is at least n_points.

       actions - hash of callback code refs indexed by character for action
          You can optionally call a callback routine when any particular  character  is  pressed.   The  actions
          table  is  a hash ref whose keys are characters and whose values are either code refs (to be called on
          the associated keypress) or array refs containing a short description string followed by a  code  ref.
          Non-printable characters (e.g. ESC, BS, DEL) are accessed via a hash followed by a three digit decimal
          ASCII  code  --  e.g. "#127" for DEL. Button events are indexed with the strings "BUTTON1", "BUTTON2",
          and "BUTTON3", and modifications must be entered as well for shift, control, and

          The code ref receives the arguments ($obj, $c, $poly,$x,$y,$mods), where:

          $obj is the plot object
          $c is the character (or "BUTTON"n"" string),
          $poly is a scalar ref; $$poly is the current polygon before the action,
          $x and $y are the current scientific coordinates, and
          $mods is the modifier string.
            You can't override the 'q' or '#027' (ESC) callbacks.   You  *can*  override  the  BUTTON1  and  DEL
            callbacks,  potentially  preventing  the  user from entering points at all!  You should do that with
            caution.

          closed - (default false): generate a closed polygon
            This works by duplicating the initial point at the end of the point list.

          markup - (default 'linespoints'): style to use to render the polygon on the fly
            If this is set to a true value, it should be a valid 'with' specifier (curve option).   The  routine
            will call markup after each click.

   <b>pause_until_close</b>
         $w-&gt;pause_until_close;

       Wait  until the active interactive plot window is closed (e.g., by clicking the close button, hitting the
       close key-binding which defaults to "q").

       "pause_until_close" blocks execution until the close event.

   <b>terminfo</b>
           use PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot qw/terminfo/;
           terminfo();        # print info about all known terminals
           terminfo 'aqua';   # print info about the aqua terminal

           $w = gpwin();
           $w-&gt;terminfo();

       Print out information about gnuplot terminals and their custom option syntax.

       The "terminfo" routine is a reference tool to describe the Gnuplot terminal types and  the  options  they
       accept.  It's mainly useful in interactive sessions.  It outputs information directly to the terminal.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Everything  should  work  on  all  platforms that support Gnuplot and Perl.  Currently, MacOS, Fedora and
       Debian Linux, Cygwin, and Microsoft Windows (under both Active State Strawberry Perl) have been tested to
       work, although the interprocess control link is not as reliable under Microsoft Windows  as  under  POSIX
       systems.  Please report successes or failures on other platforms to the authors. A transcript of a failed
       run with {tee =&gt; 1} would be most helpful.

</pre><h4><b>STILL</b> <b>TO</b> <b>DO</b></h4><pre>
       some plot and curve options need better parsing:
          - labels need attention (plot option labels)
             They  need  to  be  handled as hashes, not just as array refs.  Also, they don't seem to be working
             with timestamps.  Further, deeply nested options (e.g. "at" for labels) need attention.

       - new plot styles
          The "boxplot" plot style (new to gnuplot 4.6?) requires a different using syntax and will require some
          hacking to support.
