       Data::Printer::Profile - customize your Data::Printer with code

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package Data::Printer::Profile::MyProfile;

           sub profile {
               return {
                   show_tainted =&gt; 1,
                   show_unicode =&gt; 0,
                   array_max    =&gt; 30,

                   # ...and so on...
               }
           }
           1;

       Then put in your '.dataprinter' file:

           profile = MyProfile

       or load it at compile time:

           use DDP profile =&gt; 'MyProfile';

       or anytime during execution:

           p $some_data, profile =&gt; 'MyProfile';

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Usually a ".dataprinter" file is enough to customize Data::Printer. But sometimes you want to use actual
       code to create special filters and rules, like a dynamic color scheme depending on terminal background or
       even the hour of the day, or a custom message that includes the hostname. Who knows!

       Or maybe you just want to be able to upload your settings to CPAN and load them easily anywhere, as shown
       in the SYNOPSIS.

       For all those cases, use a profile class!

   <b>Creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>profile</b> <b>class</b>
       Simply create a module named "Data::Printer::Profile::MyProfile" (replacing, of course, "MyProfile" for
       the name of your profile).

       That class doesn't have to inherit from "Data::Printer::Profile", nor add Data::Printer as a dependency.
       All you have to do is implement a subroutine called profile() that returns a hash reference with all the
       options you want to use.

   <b>Load</b> <b>order</b>
       Profiles are read first and expanded into their options. So if you have a profile called MyProfile with,
       for example:

           show_tainted = 0
           show_lvalue  = 0

       And your ".dataprinter" file contains something like:

           profile     = MyProfile
           show_lvalue = 1

       The specific 'show_lvalues = 1' will override the other setting in the profile and the final outcome will
       be as if your setup said:

           show_tainted = 0
           show_lvalue  = 1

       However, that is of course only true when the profile is loaded together with the other settings. If you
       set a profile later, for instance as an argument to p() or np(), then the profile will override any
       previous settings - though it will still be overridden by other inline arguments.
