       File::HomeDir - Find your home and other directories on any platform

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use File::HomeDir;

         # Modern Interface (Current User)
         $home     = File::HomeDir-&gt;my_home;
         $desktop  = File::HomeDir-&gt;my_desktop;
         $docs     = File::HomeDir-&gt;my_documents;
         $music    = File::HomeDir-&gt;my_music;
         $pics     = File::HomeDir-&gt;my_pictures;
         $videos   = File::HomeDir-&gt;my_videos;
         $data     = File::HomeDir-&gt;my_data;
         $dist     = File::HomeDir-&gt;my_dist_data('File-HomeDir');
         $dist     = File::HomeDir-&gt;my_dist_config('File-HomeDir');

         # Modern Interface (Other Users)
         $home    = File::HomeDir-&gt;users_home('foo');
         $desktop = File::HomeDir-&gt;users_desktop('foo');
         $docs    = File::HomeDir-&gt;users_documents('foo');
         $music   = File::HomeDir-&gt;users_music('foo');
         $pics    = File::HomeDir-&gt;users_pictures('foo');
         $video   = File::HomeDir-&gt;users_videos('foo');
         $data    = File::HomeDir-&gt;users_data('foo');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>File::HomeDir</b> is a module for locating the directories that are "owned" by a user (typically your user)
       and to solve the various issues that arise trying to find them consistently across a wide variety of
       platforms.

       The end result is a single API that can find your resources on any platform, making it relatively trivial
       to create Perl software that works elegantly and correctly no matter where you run it.

   <b>Platform</b> <b>Neutrality</b>
       In the Unix world, many different types of data can be mixed together in your home directory (although on
       some Unix platforms this is no longer the case, particularly for "desktop"-oriented platforms).

       On some non-Unix platforms, separate directories are allocated for different types of data and have been
       for a long time.

       When writing applications on top of <b>File::HomeDir</b>, you should thus always try to use the most specific
       method you can. User documents should be saved in "my_documents", data that supports an application but
       isn't normally editing by the user directory should go into "my_data".

       On platforms that do not make any distinction, all these different methods will harmlessly degrade to the
       main home directory, but on platforms that care <b>File::HomeDir</b> will always try to Do The Right Thing(tm).

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Two types of methods are provided. The "my_method" series of methods for finding resources for the
       current user, and the "users_method" (read as "user's method") series for finding resources for arbitrary
       users.

       This split is necessary, as on most platforms it is <b>much</b> easier to find information about the current
       user compared to other users, and indeed on a number you cannot find out information such as
       "users_desktop" at all, due to security restrictions.

       All methods will double check (using a "-d" test) that a directory actually exists before returning it,
       so you may trust in the values that are returned (subject to the usual caveats of race conditions of
       directories being deleted at the moment between a directory being returned and you using it).

       However, because in some cases platforms may not support the concept of home directories at all, any
       method may return "undef" (both in scalar and list context) to indicate that there is no matching
       directory on the system.

       For example, most untrusted 'nobody'-type users do not have a home directory. So any modules that are
       used in a CGI application that at some level of recursion use your code, will result in calls to
       File::HomeDir returning undef, even for a basic <b>home()</b> call.

   <b>my_home</b>
       The "my_home" method takes no arguments and returns the main home/profile directory for the current user.

       If the distinction is important to you, the term "current" refers to the real user, and not the effective
       user.

       This is also the case for all of the other "my" methods.

       Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if the current user does not have a home directory, or
       dies on error.

   <b>my_desktop</b>
       The "my_desktop" method takes no arguments and returns the "desktop" directory for the current user.

       Due to the diversity and complexity of implementations required to deal with implementing the required
       functionality fully and completely, the "my_desktop" method may or may not be implemented on each
       platform.

       That said, I am extremely interested in code to implement "my_desktop" on Unix, as long as it is capable
       of dealing (as the Windows implementation does) with internationalization. It should also avoid false
       positive results by making sure it only returns the appropriate directories for the appropriate
       platforms.

       Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if the current user does not have a desktop directory, or
       dies on error.

   <b>my_documents</b>
       The "my_documents" method takes no arguments and returns the directory (for the current user) where the
       user's documents are stored.

       Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if the current user does not have a documents directory,
       or dies on error.

   <b>my_music</b>
       The "my_music" method takes no arguments and returns the directory where the current user's music is
       stored.

       No bias is made to any particular music type or music program, rather the concept of a directory to hold
       the user's music is made at the level of the underlying operating system or (at least) desktop
       environment.

       Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if the current user does not have a suitable directory,
       or dies on error.

   <b>my_pictures</b>
       The "my_pictures" method takes no arguments and returns the directory where the current user's pictures
       are stored.

       No bias is made to any particular picture type or picture program, rather the concept of a directory to
       hold the user's pictures is made at the level of the underlying operating system or (at least) desktop
       environment.

       Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if the current user does not have a suitable directory,
       or dies on error.

   <b>my_videos</b>
       The "my_videos" method takes no arguments and returns the directory where the current user's videos are
       stored.

       No bias is made to any particular video type or video program, rather the concept of a directory to hold
       the user's videos is made at the level of the underlying operating system or (at least) desktop
       environment.

       Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if the current user does not have a suitable directory,
       or dies on error.

   <b>my_data</b>
       The "my_data" method takes no arguments and returns the directory where local applications should store
       their internal data for the current user.

       Generally an application would create a subdirectory such as ".foo", beneath this directory, and store
       its data there. By creating your directory this way, you get an accurate result on the maximum number of
       platforms. But see the documentation about "my_dist_config()" or "my_dist_data()" below.

       For example, on Unix you get "<a href="file:~/.foo">~/.foo</a>" and on Win32 you get "<a href="file:~/Local">~/Local</a> Settings/Application Data/.foo"

       Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if the current user does not have a data directory, or
       dies on error.

   <b>my_dist_config</b>
         File::HomeDir-&gt;my_dist_config( $dist [, \%params] );

         # For example...

         File::HomeDir-&gt;my_dist_config( 'File-HomeDir' );
         File::HomeDir-&gt;my_dist_config( 'File-HomeDir', { create =&gt; 1 } );

       The "my_dist_config" method takes a distribution name as argument and returns an application-specific
       directory where they should store their internal configuration.

       The base directory will be either "my_config" if the platform supports it, or "my_documents" otherwise.
       The subdirectory itself will be "BASE/Perl/Dist-Name". If the base directory is the user's home
       directory, "my_dist_config" will be in "<a href="file:~/.perl/Dist-Name">~/.perl/Dist-Name</a>" (and thus be hidden on all Unixes).

       The optional last argument is a hash reference to tweak the method behaviour. The following hash keys are
       recognized:

       â€¢   create

           Passing  a  true  value  to  this  key  will  force the creation of the directory if it doesn't exist
           (remember that "File::HomeDir"'s policy is to return "undef" if the directory doesn't exist).

           Defaults to false, meaning no automatic creation of directory.

   <b>my_dist_data</b>
         File::HomeDir-&gt;my_dist_data( $dist [, \%params] );

         # For example...

         File::HomeDir-&gt;my_dist_data( 'File-HomeDir' );
         File::HomeDir-&gt;my_dist_data( 'File-HomeDir', { create =&gt; 1 } );

       The "my_dist_data" method takes a distribution name  as  argument  and  returns  an  application-specific
       directory where they should store their internal data.

       This  directory  will  be  of  course  a  subdirectory  of  "my_data". Platforms supporting data-specific
       directories  will  use  "DATA_DIR/perl/dist/Dist-Name"  following  the  common  "DATA/vendor/application"
       pattern.   If  the  "my_data"  directory  is  the  user's  home  directory,  "my_dist_data"  will  be  in
       "<a href="file:~/.perl/dist/Dist-Name">~/.perl/dist/Dist-Name</a>" (and thus be hidden on all Unixes).

       The optional last argument is a hash reference to tweak the method behaviour. The following hash keys are
       recognized:

       â€¢   create

           Passing a true value to this key will force the  creation  of  the  directory  if  it  doesn't  exist
           (remember that "File::HomeDir"'s policy is to return "undef" if the directory doesn't exist).

           Defaults to false, meaning no automatic creation of directory.

   <b>users_home</b>
         $home = File::HomeDir-&gt;users_home('foo');

       The  "users_home" method takes a single parameter and is used to locate the parent home/profile directory
       for an identified user on the system.

       While most of the time this identifier would be some form of user name, it  is  permitted  to  vary  per-
       platform to support user ids or UUIDs as applicable for that platform.

       Returns  the  directory path as a string, "undef" if that user does not have a home directory, or dies on
       error.

   <b>users_documents</b>
         $docs = File::HomeDir-&gt;users_documents('foo');

       Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if that user does not have a documents directory, or dies
       on error.

   <b>users_data</b>
         $data = File::HomeDir-&gt;users_data('foo');

       Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if that user does not have a data directory, or  dies  on
       error.

   <b>users_desktop</b>
         $docs = File::HomeDir-&gt;users_desktop('foo');

       Returns  the  directory path as a string, "undef" if that user does not have a desktop directory, or dies
       on error.

   <b>users_music</b>
         $docs = File::HomeDir-&gt;users_music('foo');

       Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if that user does not have a music directory, or dies  on
       error.

   <b>users_pictures</b>
         $docs = File::HomeDir-&gt;users_pictures('foo');

       Returns  the directory path as a string, "undef" if that user does not have a pictures directory, or dies
       on error.

   <b>users_videos</b>
         $docs = File::HomeDir-&gt;users_videos('foo');

       Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if that user does not have a videos directory, or dies on
       error.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>home</b>
         use File::HomeDir;
         $home = home();
         $home = home('foo');
         $home = File::HomeDir::home();
         $home = File::HomeDir::home('foo');

       The "home" function is exported by default and is provided for compatibility with legacy applications. In
       new applications, you should use the newer method-based interface above.

       Returns the directory path to a named user's home/profile directory.

       If provided no parameter, returns the directory path to the current user's home/profile directory.

</pre><h4><b>TO</b> <b>DO</b></h4><pre>
       â€¢   Add more granularity to Unix, and add support to VMS and other esoteric platforms, so we can consider
           going core.

       â€¢   Add consistent support for users_* methods
