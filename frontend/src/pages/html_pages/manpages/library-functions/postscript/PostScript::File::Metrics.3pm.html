       PostScript::File::Metrics - Metrics for PostScript fonts

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 2.11 of PostScript::File::Metrics, released October 10, 2015 as part of
       PostScript-File version 2.23.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use PostScript::File;

         my $ps = PostScript::File-&gt;new(reencode =&gt; 'cp1252');

         my $metrics = $ps-&gt;get_metrics('Helvetica-iso', 9);

         my $upos = $metrics-&gt;underline_position;

         my $width = $metrics-&gt;width('Hello, World!');

         my @lines = $metrics-&gt;wrap( 72, # wrap it into 1 inch lines
           'This is a long string that will not fit on just one line of text.'
         );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       PostScript::File::Metrics provides a subset of the metrics available from Font::AFM.  Its reason for
       existence is that it allows you to pre-compile the AFM files into Perl modules.  This makes loading them
       more efficient, but more importantly, it means you don't have to install (or configure) Font::AFM.
       That's important because the locations and filenames of AFM files are not very standardized, which makes
       configuring Font::AFM quite difficult.

       PostScript::File::Metrics includes pre-compiled metrics for the 13 standard PostScript fonts:

         Courier              Helvetica              Times-Roman
         Courier-Bold         Helvetica-Bold         Times-Bold
         Courier-BoldOblique  Helvetica-BoldOblique  Times-BoldItalic
         Courier-Oblique      Helvetica-Oblique      Times-Italic
                              Symbol

       If you need metrics for a font not in that list, you'll need to have Font::AFM installed and configured.
       (You can modify <u>examples/generate_metrics.pl</u> to create additional pre-compiled modules, but you'll still
       have to get Font::AFM working on one system.)

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       All attributes are read-only, except for "auto_hyphen" and "size", which can be set using the
       corresponding "set_" methods.

   <b>size</b>
       The current font size in points.  This is not an attribute of the font, but of this Metrics object.  The
       attributes that describe the font's dimensions are adjusted according to this value.

   <b>auto_hyphen</b>
       If true, the "width" and "wrap" methods will do hyphen-minus processing as described in "Hyphens and
       Minus Signs" in PostScript::File, but only if the encoding is "cp1252" or "iso-8859-1".

   <b>full_name</b>
       Unique, human-readable name for an individual font, for instance "Times Roman".

   <b>family</b>
       Human-readable name for a group of fonts that are stylistic variants of a single design. All fonts that
       are members of such a group should have exactly the same "family". Example of a family name is "Times".

   <b>weight</b>
       Human-readable name for the weight, or "boldness", attribute of a font.  Examples are "Roman", "Bold",
       "Medium".

   <b>italic_angle</b>
       Angle in degrees counterclockwise from the vertical of the dominant vertical strokes of the font.  (This
       is normally &lt;= 0.)

   <b>fixed_pitch</b>
       1 if the font is a fixed-pitch (monospaced) font.  0 otherwise.

   <b>font_bbox</b>
       An arrayref of four numbers giving the lower-left x, lower-left y, upper-right x, and upper-right y of
       the font bounding box. The font bounding box is the smallest rectangle enclosing the shape that would
       result if all the characters of the font were placed with their origins coincident at (0,0), and then
       painted.  You must not modify the returned arrayref.

   <b>cap_height</b>
       Usually the y-value of the top of the capital H.  Some fonts, like Symbol, may not define this attribute.

   <b>x_height</b>
       Typically the y-value of the top of the lowercase x.  Some fonts, like Symbol, may not define this
       attribute.

   <b>ascender</b>
       Typically the y-value of the top of the lowercase d.  Some fonts, like Symbol, may not define this
       attribute.

   <b>descender</b>
       Typically the y-value of the bottom of the lowercase p.  Some fonts, like Symbol, may not define this
       attribute.

   <b>underline_position</b>
       Recommended distance from the baseline for positioning underline strokes. This number is the y coordinate
       of the center of the stroke.

   <b>underline_thickness</b>
       Recommended stroke width for underlining.

   <b>version</b>
       Version number of the font.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         $metrics = PostScript::File::Metrics-&gt;new($font, [$size, [$encoding]])

       You would normally use "get_metrics" in PostScript::File to construct a Metrics object (because it can
       get the $encoding from the document), but it is possible to construct one directly.

       $size is the font size in points, and defaults to 1000.

       $encoding is the character encoding used by "width" and "wrap".  Valid choices are "std", "sym",
       "cp1252", and "iso-8859-1".  The default is "std", meaning PostScript's StandardEncoding (unless the
       $font is Symbol, which uses "sym", meaning PostScript's SymbolEncoding).  Neither "std" nor "sym" does
       any character set translation.

       The "auto_hyphen" attribute is always set to true when character translation is enabled.

   <b>set_auto_hyphen(</b> <b>translate</b> <b>)</b>
       If translate is a true value, then "width" and "wrap" will do automatic hyphen-minus translation as
       described in "Hyphens and Minus Signs" in PostScript::File.

   <b>set_size</b>
         $metrics-&gt;set_size($new_size)

       This method sets the font size (in points).  This influences the attributes that concern dimensions and
       the string width calculations.  It returns the Metrics object, so you can chain to the next method.

   <b>set_wrap_chars</b>
         $metrics-&gt;set_wrap_chars($new_chars)

       This method (introduced in version 2.11) sets the characters after which a word can be wrapped.  A line
       can wrap after any character in $new_chars, which <u>should</u> <u>not</u> include whitespace.  Whitespace is always a
       valid breakpoint.  If $new_chars is omitted or "undef", restores the default wrap characters, which means
       "-/" and (if using cp1252) both en and em dashes.  It returns the Metrics object, so you can chain to the
       next method.

   <b>width</b>
         $width = $metrics-&gt;width($string, [$already_encoded])

       This calculates the width of $string (in points) when displayed in this font at the current size.  If
       $string has the UTF8 flag set, it is translated into the font's encoding.  Otherwise, the $string is
       expected to be in the correct character set already.  $string should not contain newlines.

       If optional parameter $already_encoded is true, then $string is assumed to be already encoded in the
       document's character set.  This also prevents any hyphen-minus processing.

   <b>wrap</b>
         @lines = $metrics-&gt;wrap($width, $text, [\%param])

       This wraps $text into lines of no more than $width points.  If $text contains newlines, they will also
       cause line breaks.  If $text has the UTF8 flag set, it is translated into the font's encoding.
       Otherwise, the $text is expected to be in the correct character set already.

       If the "auto_hyphen" attribute is true, then any HYPHEN-MINUS (U+002D) characters in $text will be
       converted to either HYPHEN (U+2010) or MINUS SIGN (U+2212) in the returned strings.

       The characters after which a line can wrap (other than space and tab, which are always valid line breaks)
       can be set with the "set_wrap_chars" method.  In addition, $text may contain ZERO WIDTH SPACE (U+200B)
       characters to indicate potential line breaks.  All ZWSP characters and CRs will be removed from the
       returned strings.  $text may also contain NO-BREAK SPACE (U+00A0) characters, which indicate whitespace
       without a potential line break.

       The optional "\%param" (introduced in version 2.11) allows additional control over the wrapping.  It may
       contain the following keys:

       chars
           This  overrides  the line-breaking characters normally set by the "set_wrap_chars" method.  The value
           has the same meaning as for "set_wrap_chars".

       maxlines
           The maximum number of lines to return.  The final line will contain all the remaining text,  even  if
           that exceeds $width or contains newline characters.

       quiet
           If true, do not warn about words that are too wide to fit in the specified $width.

       warnings
           If  present,  must  be  an  arrayref.   Warning  messages about words that are too wide to fit in the
           specified $width will be pushed onto the array.  You should also pass "quiet =&gt; 1" if you don't  want
           the warnings printed to STDERR.
