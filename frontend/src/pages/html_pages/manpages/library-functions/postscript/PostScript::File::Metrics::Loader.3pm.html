</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PostScript::File::Metrics::Loader - Load metrics for PostScript fonts using Font::AFM

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 2.20 of PostScript::File::Metrics::Loader, released October 10, 2015 as
       part of PostScript-File version 2.23.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       PostScript::File::Metrics::Loader is used by PostScript::File::Metrics when no pre-compiled metrics are
       available for the requested font or encoding.  It uses Font::AFM to read the AFM file and extract metrics
       from it.

       You should not normally need to use this module, since pre-compiled metrics for the standard PostScript
       fonts are included with this distribution.  If you request metrics for a non-standard font,
       PostScript::File::Metrics will load this module automatically.

       If you need metrics for additional fonts, you may want to modify and run <u>examples/generate_metrics.pl</u> to
       create pre-compiled modules for them.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>get_encoding_vector</b>
         PostScript::File::Metrics::Loader::get_encoding_vector($encoding)

       This returns the encoding vector for $encoding, an arrayref of 256 glyph names.

   <b>load</b>
         PostScript::File::Metrics::Loader::load($font, \@encodings)

       This uses Font::AFM to read the metrics for $font, and creates width tables for each of the @encodings.
       The metrics are stored into the hashes used internally by PostScript::File::Metrics.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       "Can't find definition for %s"
           If this happens, it indicates you found a bug in PostScript::File::Metrics::Loader.  Please report it
           as described under "AUTHOR".

       "Can't find the AFM file for %s"
           Font::AFM  could  not  find  <u>%s.afm</u>  in  any  of the directories it searched.  See "CONFIGURATION AND
           ENVIRONMENT".

       "Invalid term %s in %s"
           This also indicates a bug in PostScript::File.  Please report it.

       "Unknown encoding %s"
           You asked for an encoding that PostScript::File::Metrics doesn't know about.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       PostScript::File::Metrics::Loader requires no configuration files or environment variables.

       However, it uses Font::AFM, and unfortunately that's difficult to configure  properly  (which  is  why  I
       created  PostScript::File::Metrics  in  the  first  place).   Font::AFM  expects  to  find  a  file named
       <u>FontName.afm</u> in one of the directories it searches.

       I wound up creating symlinks in <u>/usr/local/lib/afm/</u> (which is one of the  default  paths  that  Font::AFM
       searches if you don't have a "METRICS" environment variable):

        Courier.afm
          -&gt; /usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/afm/adobe/courier/pcrr8a.afm
        Courier-Bold.afm
          -&gt; /usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/afm/adobe/courier/pcrb8a.afm
        Courier-BoldOblique.afm
          -&gt; /usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/afm/adobe/courier/pcrbo8a.afm
        Courier-Oblique.afm
          -&gt; /usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/afm/adobe/courier/pcrro8a.afm
        Helvetica.afm
          -&gt; /usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/afm/adobe/helvetic/phvr8a.afm
        Helvetica-Bold.afm
          -&gt; /usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/afm/adobe/helvetic/phvb8a.afm
        Helvetica-BoldOblique.afm
          -&gt; /usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/afm/adobe/helvetic/phvbo8a.afm
        Helvetica-Oblique.afm
          -&gt; /usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/afm/adobe/helvetic/phvro8a.afm
        Symbol.afm
          -&gt; /usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/afm/adobe/symbol/psyr.afm
        Times-Bold.afm
          -&gt; /usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/afm/adobe/times/ptmb8a.afm
        Times-BoldItalic.afm
          -&gt; /usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/afm/adobe/times/ptmbi8a.afm
        Times-Italic.afm
          -&gt; /usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/afm/adobe/times/ptmri8a.afm
        Times-Roman.afm
          -&gt; /usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/afm/adobe/times/ptmr8a.afm

       Paths  on  your  system  may  vary.   I  suggest  searching  for ".afm" files, and then grepping them for
       "FontName X", where X is the font you need metrics for.
