</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PostScript::File::Functions - Collection of useful PostScript functions

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 2.23 of PostScript::File::Functions, released October 10, 2015 as part of
       PostScript-File version 2.23.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use PostScript::File;

         my $ps = PostScript::File-&gt;new;
         $ps-&gt;use_functions(qw( setColor showCenter ));
         $ps-&gt;add_to_page("1 setColor\n" .
                          "400 400 (Hello, World!) showCenter\n");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       PostScript::File::Functions provides a library of handy PostScript functions that can be used in
       documents created with PostScript::File.  You don't normally use this module directly; PostScript::File's
       "use_functions" method loads it automatically.

</pre><h4><b>POSTSCRIPT</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>boxPath</b>
         LEFT TOP RIGHT BOTTOM boxPath

       Given the coordinates of the sides of a box, this creates a new, closed path starting at the bottom right
       corner, across to the bottom left, up to the top left, over to the top right, and then back to the bottom
       right.

   <b>clipBox</b>
          LEFT TOP RIGHT BOTTOM clipBox

       This clips to the box defined by the coordinates.

   <b>drawBox</b>
          LEFT TOP RIGHT BOTTOM drawBox

       This calls boxPath to and then strokes the path using the current pen.

   <b>fillBox</b>
         LEFT TOP RIGHT BOTTOM COLOR fillBox

       This fills the path created by boxPath with "COLOR", which can be anything accepted by setColor.

   <b>hLine</b>
         WIDTH X Y hline

       Stroke a horizontal line with the current pen with the left endpoint at position "X, Y", extending
       "WIDTH" points rightwards.

   <b>setColor</b>
         RGB-ARRAY|BW-NUMBER setColor

       This combines "setgray" and "setrgbcolor" into a single function.  You can provide either an array of 3
       numbers for "setrgbcolor", or a single number for "setgray".  The "str" in PostScript::File function was
       designed to format the parameter to this function.

   <b>showCenter</b>
         X Y STRING showCenter

       This prints "STRING" centered horizontally at position X using baseline Y and the current font.

   <b>showLeft</b>
         X Y STRING showLeft

       This prints "STRING" left justified at position X using baseline Y and the current font.

   <b>showLines</b>
         X Y LINES SPACING FUNC showLines

       This calls "FUNC" for each element of "LINES", which should be an array of strings.  "FUNC" is called
       with "X Y STRING" on the stack, and it must pop those off.  "SPACING" is subtracted from "Y" after every
       line.  "FUNC" will normally be "showCenter", "showLeft", or "showRight".

   <b>showRight</b>
         X Y STRING showRight

       This prints "STRING" right justified at position X using baseline Y and the current font.

   <b>vLine</b>
         HEIGHT X Y vline

       Stroke a vertical line with the current pen with the bottom endpoint at position "X, Y", extending
       "HEIGHT" points upwards.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       While you don't normally deal with PostScript::File::Functions objects directly, it is possible.  The
       following methods are available:

   <b>new</b>
         $funcs = PostScript::File::Functions-&gt;new;

       The constructor takes no parameters.

   <b>add</b>
         $funcs-&gt;add('functionRequested', ...);

       Add one or more functions to the procset to be generated.  All dependencies of the requested functions
       are added automatically.  See "POSTSCRIPT FUNCTIONS" for the list of available functions.

   <b>add_to_file</b>
         $funcs-&gt;add_to_file($ps, $basename);

       This is short for

         $ps-&gt;add_procset( $funcs-&gt;generate_procset($basename) );

       $ps should normally be a PostScript::File object.  See "add_procset" in PostScript::File.

   <b>generate_procset</b>
         ($name, $code, $version) = $funcs-&gt;generate_procset($basename);

       This collects the requested functions into a block of PostScript code.

       $name is a suitable name for the procset, created by appending the ids of the requested functions to
       $basename.  If $basename is omitted, it defaults to the class name with "::" replaced by "_".

       $code is a block of PostScript code that defines the functions.  It contains no comments or excess
       whitespace.

       $version is the version number of the procset.

       In scalar context, returns $code.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       "%s is not an available function"
           You requested a function that this version of PostScript::File::Functions doesn't provide.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       PostScript::File::Functions requires no configuration files or environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       No bugs have been reported.
