</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test2::Util - Tools used by Test2 and friends.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Collection of tools used by Test2 and friends.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       All exports are optional. You must specify subs to import.

       ($success, $error) = try { ... }
           Eval  the  codeblock, return success or failure, and the error message. This code protects $@ and $!,
           they will be restored by the end of the run. This code also temporarily blocks $SIG{DIE} handlers.

       protect { ... }
           Similar to try, except that it does not catch exceptions. The idea here is to protect $@ and $!  from
           changes. $@ and $! will be restored to whatever they were before the run so long as it is successful.
           If the run fails $! will still be restored, but $@ will contain the exception being thrown.

       CAN_FORK
           True if this system is capable of true or pseudo-fork.

       CAN_REALLY_FORK
           True if the system can really fork. This will be false for systems where fork is emulated.

       CAN_THREAD
           True if this system is capable of using threads.

       USE_THREADS
           Returns true if threads are enabled, false if they are not.

       get_tid
           This will return the id of the current thread when threads are enabled, otherwise it returns 0.

       my $file = pkg_to_file($package)
           Convert a package name to a filename.

       $string = <b>ipc_separator()</b>
           Get the IPC separator. Currently this is always the string '~'.

       $string = <b>gen_uid()</b>
           Generate  a  unique  id (NOT A UUID). This will typically be the process id, the thread id, the time,
           and an incrementing integer all joined with the ipc_separator().

           These ID's are unique enough for most purposes. For identical ids to be generated  you  must  have  2
           processes  with  the  same  PID  generate  IDs  at  the  same time with the same current state of the
           incrementing integer. This is a perfectly reasonable  thing  to  expect  to  happen  across  multiple
           machines, but is quite unlikely to happen on one machine.

           This can fail to be unique if a process generates an id, calls exec, and does it again after the exec
           and  it  all  happens  in less than a second. It can also happen if the systems process id's cycle in
           less than a second allowing 2 different programs that use this generator to run with the same PID  in
           less  than  a second. Both these cases are sufficiently unlikely. If you need universally unique ids,
           or ids that are unique in these conditions, look at Data::UUID.

       ($ok, $err) = do_rename($old_name, $new_name)
           Rename a file, this wraps rename() in a way that makes it more reliable cross-platform when trying to
           rename files you recently altered.

       ($ok, $err) = do_unlink($filename)
           Unlink a file, this wraps unlink() in a way that makes it more reliable cross-platform when trying to
           unlink files you recently altered.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       5.10.0
           Perl 5.10.0 has a bug when compiled with newer gcc versions. This bug causes a  segfault  whenever  a
           new thread is launched. Test2 will attempt to detect this, and note that the system is not capable of
           forking when it is detected.

       Devel::Cover
           Devel::Cover  does not support threads. CAN_THREAD will return false if Devel::Cover is loaded before
           the check is first run.
