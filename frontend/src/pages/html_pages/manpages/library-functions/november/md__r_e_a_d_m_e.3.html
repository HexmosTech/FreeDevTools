       LAPACK  is a library of Fortran subroutines for solving the most commonly occurring problems in numerical
       linear algebra.

       LAPACK is a freely-available software package. It can be included in commercial  software  packages  (and
       has  been). We only ask that that proper credit be given to the authors, for example by citing the LAPACK
       Users' Guide. The license used for the software is the modified BSD license.

       Like all software, it is copyrighted. It is not trademarked, but we do ask the following: if  you  modify
       the source for these routines we ask that you change the name of the routine and comment the changes made
       to the original.

       We will gladly answer any questions regarding the software. If a modification is done, however, it is the
       responsibility of the person who modified the routine to provide support.

       LAPACK is available from GitHub. LAPACK releases are also available on netlib.

       The  distribution  contains  (1)  the  Fortran  source  for LAPACK, and (2) its testing programs. It also
       contains (3) the Fortran reference implementation of the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (the  Level  1,
       2,  and  3  BLAS)  needed  by  LAPACK.  However  this  code is intended for use only if there is no other
       implementation of the BLAS already available on your machine; the efficiency of LAPACK depends very  much
       on  the efficiency of the BLAS. It also contains (4) CBLAS, a C interface to the BLAS, and (5) LAPACKE, a
       C interface to LAPACK.

</pre><h4><b>Installation</b></h4><pre>
       • LAPACK  can  be  installed  with  make.  The  configuration  must  be  set  in  the  make.inc  file.  A
         make.inc.example  for  a  Linux  machine  running  GNU  compilers  is given in the main directory. Some
         specific make.inc are also available in the INSTALL directory.

       • LAPACK includes also the CMake build. You will need to have CMake installed on your machine. CMake will
         allow an easy installation on a Windows Machine. An example CMake build to install the  LAPACK  library
         under $HOME/.local/lapack/ is:

       mkdir build
       cd build
       cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local/lapack ..
       cmake --build . -j --target install

       • LAPACK can be built and installed using vcpkg dependency manager:

       git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
       cd vcpkg
       ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh  # ./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat for Windows
       ./vcpkg integrate install
       ./vcpkg install lapack

        The lapack port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the
       version is out of date, please create an issue or pull request on the vcpkg repository.

</pre><h4><b>User</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
       LAPACK  has been thoroughly tested, on many different types of computers. The LAPACK project supports the
       package in the sense that reports of errors or poor performance will gain immediate  attention  from  the
       developers.  Such reports, descriptions of interesting applications, and other comments should be sent by
       email to the LAPACK team.

       A list of known problems, bugs, and compiler errors for LAPACK is maintained on  netlib.  Please  see  as
       well the GitHub issue tracker.

       For  further  information  on  LAPACK  please  read  our  FAQ and Users' Guide. A user forum and specific
       information for running LAPACK under Windows. is also available to help you with the LAPACK library.

</pre><h4><b>Testing</b></h4><pre>
       LAPACK includes a thorough test suite. We recommend that, after compilation, you run the test suite.

       For complete information on the LAPACK Testing please consult LAPACK Working Note 41 'Installation  Guide
       for LAPACK'.

</pre><h4><b>LAPACKE</b></h4><pre>
       LAPACK  now  includes  the LAPACKE package. LAPACKE is a Standard C language API for LAPACK that was born
       from a collaboration of the LAPACK and INTEL Math Kernel Library teams.
