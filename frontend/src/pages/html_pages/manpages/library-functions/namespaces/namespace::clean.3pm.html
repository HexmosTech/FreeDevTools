</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Keeping</b> <b>packages</b> <b>clean</b>
       When you define a function, or import one, into a Perl package, it will naturally also be available as a
       method. This does not per se cause problems, but it can complicate subclassing and, for example, plugin
       classes that are included via multiple inheritance by loading them as base classes.

       The "namespace::clean" pragma will remove all previously declared or imported symbols at the end of the
       current package's compile cycle.  Functions called in the package itself will still be bound by their
       name, but they won't show up as methods on your class or instances.

       By unimporting via "no" you can tell "namespace::clean" to start collecting functions for the next "use
       namespace::clean;" specification.

       You can use the "-except" flag to tell "namespace::clean" that you don't want it to remove a certain
       function or method. A common use would be a module exporting an "import" method along with some
       functions:

         use ModuleExportingImport;
         use namespace::clean -except =&gt; [qw( import )];

       If you just want to "-except" a single sub, you can pass it directly.  For more than one value you have
       to use an array reference.

       <u>Late</u> <u>binding</u> <u>caveat</u>

       Note that the technique used by this module relies on perl having resolved all names to actual code
       references during the compilation of a scope. While this is almost always what the interpreter does,
       there are some exceptions, notably the sort SUBNAME style of the "sort" built-in invocation. The
       following example will not work, because "sort" does not try to resolve the function name to an actual
       code reference until <b>runtime</b>.

        use MyApp::Utils 'my_sorter';
        use namespace::clean;

        my @sorted = sort my_sorter @list;

       You need to work around this by forcing a compile-time resolution like so:

        use MyApp::Utils 'my_sorter';
        use namespace::clean;

        my $my_sorter_cref = \&amp;my_sorter;

        my @sorted = sort $my_sorter_cref @list;

   <b>Explicitly</b> <b>removing</b> <b>functions</b> <b>when</b> <b>your</b> <b>scope</b> <b>is</b> <b>compiled</b>
       It is also possible to explicitly tell "namespace::clean" what packages to remove when the surrounding
       scope has finished compiling. Here is an example:

         package Foo;
         use strict;

         # blessed NOT available

         sub my_class {
             use Scalar::Util qw( blessed );
             use namespace::clean qw( blessed );

             # blessed available
             return blessed shift;
         }

         # blessed NOT available

   <b>Moose</b>
       When using "namespace::clean" together with Moose you want to keep the installed "meta" method. So your
       classes should look like:

         package Foo;
         use Moose;
         use namespace::clean -except =&gt; 'meta';
         ...

       Same goes for Moose::Role.

   <b>Cleaning</b> <b>other</b> <b>packages</b>
       You can tell "namespace::clean" that you want to clean up another package instead of the one importing.
       To do this you have to pass in the "-cleanee" option like this:

         package My::MooseX::namespace::clean;
         use strict;

         use namespace::clean (); # no cleanup, just load

         sub import {
             namespace::clean-&gt;import(
               -cleanee =&gt; scalar(caller),
               -except  =&gt; 'meta',
             );
         }

       If you don't care about "namespace::clean"s discover-and-"-except" logic, and just want to remove
       subroutines, try "clean_subroutines".

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>clean_subroutines</b>
       This exposes the actual subroutine-removal logic.

         namespace::clean-&gt;clean_subroutines($cleanee, qw( subA subB ));

       will remove "subA" and "subB" from $cleanee. Note that this will remove the subroutines <b>immediately</b> and
       not wait for scope end. If you want to have this effect at a specific time (e.g. "namespace::clean" acts
       on scope compile end) it is your responsibility to make sure it runs at that time.

   <b>import</b>
       Makes a snapshot of the current defined functions and installs a B::Hooks::EndOfScope hook in the current
       scope to invoke the cleanups.

   <b>unimport</b>
       This method will be called when you do a

         no namespace::clean;

       It will start a new section of code that defines functions to clean up.

   <b>get_class_store</b>
       This returns a reference to a hash in a passed package containing information about function names
       included and excluded from removal.

   <b>get_functions</b>
       Takes a class as argument and returns all currently defined functions in it as a hash reference with the
       function name as key and a typeglob reference to the symbol as value.

</pre><h4><b>IMPLEMENTATION</b> <b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       This module works through the effect that a

         delete $SomePackage::{foo};

       will remove the "foo" symbol from $SomePackage for run time lookups (e.g., method calls) but will leave
       the entry alive to be called by already resolved names in the package itself. "namespace::clean" will
       restore and therefor in effect keep all glob slots that aren't "CODE".

       A test file has been added to the perl core to ensure that this behaviour will be stable in future
       releases.

       Just for completeness sake, if you want to remove the symbol completely, use "undef" instead.
