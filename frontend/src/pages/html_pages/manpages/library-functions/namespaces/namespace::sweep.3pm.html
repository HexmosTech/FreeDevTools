</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       namespace::sweep - Sweep up imported subs in your classes

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.006

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package Foo;

           use namespace::sweep;
           use Some::Module qw(some_function);

           sub my_method {
                my $foo = some_function();
                ...
           }

           package main;

           Foo-&gt;my_method;      # ok
           Foo-&gt;some_function;  # ERROR!

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Because Perl methods are just regular subroutines, it's difficult to tell what's a method and what's just
       an imported function. As a result, imported functions can be called as methods on your objects. This
       pragma will delete imported functions from your class's symbol table, thereby ensuring that your
       interface is as you specified it. However, code inside your module will still be able to use the imported
       functions without any problems.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The following arguments may be passed on the "use" line:

       -cleanee
           If  you  want  to clean a different class than the one importing this pragma, you can specify it with
           this flag. Otherwise, the importing class is assumed.

               package Foo;
               use namespace::sweep -cleanee =&gt; 'Bar'   # sweep up Bar.pm

       -also
           This lets you provide a mechanism to specify other subs to  sweep  up  that  would  not  normally  be
           caught.  (For  example,  private  helper  subs  in  your  module's class that should not be called as
           methods.)

               package Foo;
               use namespace::sweep -also =&gt; '_helper';          # sweep up single sub
               use namespace::sweep -also =&gt; [qw/foo bar baz/];  # list of subs
               use namespace::sweep -also =&gt; qr/^secret_/;       # subs matching regex

           You can also specify a subroutine reference which will receive the symbol name  as  $_.  If  the  sub
           returns true, the symbol will be swept.

               # sweep up those rude four-letter subs
               use namespace::sweep -also =&gt; sub { return 1 if length $_ == 4 }

           You can also combine these methods into an array reference:

               use namespace::sweep -also =&gt; [ 'string', sub { 1 if /$pat/ and $_ !~ /$other/ }, qr/^foo_.+/ ];

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       This pragma was written to address some problems with the excellent namespace::autoclean.  In particular,
       namespace::autoclean  will  remove  special  symbols  that  are  installed  by overload, so you can't use
       namespace::autoclean on objects that overload Perl operators.

       Additionally, namespace::autoclean relies on Class::MOP to figure out the list  of  methods  provided  by
       your  class.  This pragma does not depend on Class::MOP or Moose, so you can use it for non-Moose classes
       without worrying about heavy dependencies.

       However, if your class has a Moose (or Moose-compatible) "meta" object, then that will be  used  to  find
       e.g. methods from composed roles that should not be deleted.

       In  most  cases,  namespace::sweep  should  work as a drop-in replacement for namespace::autoclean.  Upon
       release, this pragma passes all of namespace::autoclean's tests, in addition to its own.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       This is an early release and there are bound to be a few hiccups along the way.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Thanks Florian Ragwitz and Tomas Doran for writing and maintaining namespace::autoclean.

       Thanks to Toby Inkster for submitting some better code for finding "meta" objects.
