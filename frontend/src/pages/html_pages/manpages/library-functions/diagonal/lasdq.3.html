       <b>DLASDQ</b> computes the SVD of a real bidiagonal matrix with diagonal d and off-diagonal e. Used by sbdsdc.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DLASDQ computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real
            (upper or lower) bidiagonal matrix with diagonal D and offdiagonal
            E, accumulating the transformations if desired. Letting B denote
            the input bidiagonal matrix, the algorithm computes orthogonal
            matrices Q and P such that B = Q * S * P**T (P**T denotes the transpose
            of P). The singular values S are overwritten on D.

            The input matrix U  is changed to U  * Q  if desired.
            The input matrix VT is changed to P**T * VT if desired.
            The input matrix C  is changed to Q**T * C  if desired.

            See 'Computing  Small Singular Values of Bidiagonal Matrices With
            Guaranteed High Relative Accuracy,' by J. Demmel and W. Kahan,
            LAPACK Working Note #3, for a detailed description of the algorithm.
