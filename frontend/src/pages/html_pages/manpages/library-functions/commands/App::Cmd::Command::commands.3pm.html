</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Cmd::Command::commands - list the application's commands

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.337

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command will list all of the application commands available and their abstracts.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>execute</b>
       This is the command's primary method and raison d'etre.  It prints the application's usage text (if any)
       followed by a sorted listing of the application's commands and their abstracts.

       The commands are printed in sorted groups (created by "sort_commands"); each group is set off by blank
       lines.

   <b>"sort_commands"</b>
         my @sorted = $cmd-&gt;sort_commands(@unsorted);

       This method orders the list of commands into groups which it returns as a list of arrayrefs, and optional
       group header strings.

       By default, the first group is for the "help" and "commands" commands, and all other commands are in the
       second group.

       This method can be overridden by implementing the "commands_groups" method in your application base
       clase.
