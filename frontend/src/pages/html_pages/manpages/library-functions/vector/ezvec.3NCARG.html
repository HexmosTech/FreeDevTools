</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       EZVEC - A front-end to VELVCT with a simpler interface. Like VELVCT, it plots a a vector field in a
       single call.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL EZVEC (U,V,M,N)

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       EZVEC is obsolete, and is supported only to provide compatibility with old NCAR Graphics codes. However,
       the compatibility mode parameter, CPM, offers a number of options to help ease the the transition to the
       new version of the utility. When writing new code you are encouraged not to use this entry point, since
       it provides less capability than the standard Vectors interface, and may eventually be phased out.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS#</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_ezvec (float *u, float *v, int m, int n)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       U           (REAL  2-dimensional  array, dimensioned M x n: n &gt;= N, input) By default, assumed to contain
                   the first dimensional Cartesian components of the vector field. However, if PLR is  non-zero,
                   it is treated as containing the vector magnitudes.

       V           (REAL  2-dimensional  array, dimensioned M x n: n &gt;= N, input) By default, assumed to contain
                   the second dimensional Cartesian components of the vector field.  However,  if  PLR  is  non-
                   zero, it is treated as containing the vector angles.

       M           (INTEGER, input) Actual size of the first dimension of arrays U and V

       N           (INTEGER, input) Assumed size of the second dimension of arrays U and V.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions with the following
       exceptions:

       m           The actual size of the second dimension of arrays u and v.

       n           The assumed size of first dimension of arrays u and v.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       U and V are 2-dimensional vector component arrays, whose actual first dimensions must  be  equal  to  the
       value of M, and whose second dimensions must equal or exceed the value of N.

       Assuming  the  default value of the compatibility mode parameter, CPM, Vectors always performs a SET call
       and draws a perimeter around the plot when accessed through the EZVEC interface. Before the  return  from
       EZVEC, another call to SET restores the previous coordinate system mapping.

       By  modifying the value of CPM, you may take more control over the utility than originally possible using
       this entry point. For instance, you can override the default value of  the  SET  parameter,  or  use  the
       Version  3.2  coordinate  system  mapping  routines  instead  of  the old FX, FY, MXF, and MYF functions.
       Nevertheless, when creating new code, use the VVINIT/VVECTR interface, since its capabilities are greater
       and more likely to improve with time.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant example: tvelvc.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use EZVEC, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in that order.
