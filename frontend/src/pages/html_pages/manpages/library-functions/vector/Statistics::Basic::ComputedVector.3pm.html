</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Statistics::Basic::ComputedVector - a class for computing filtered vectors

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Invoke it this way:

           my $vector   = vector(1,2,3);
           my $computed = computed($vector)-&gt;set_filter(sub{
               # NOTE: only interested in even numbers:
               grep { !($_ % 2) } @_
           });

           # nearly the same, opposite order:

           my $computed = computed(1,2,3)-&gt;set_filter(sub {map{$_+1}@_});
           my $vector   = $computed-&gt;query_vector;

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>new()</b>
           The  constructor  takes  a  single  array  ref  or  a single Statistics::Basic::ComputedVector as its
           argument.  It returns a Statistics::Basic::ComputedVector object.

           If passed arguments other than Statistics::Basic::Vector  objects,  the  constructor  will  built  an
           appropriate vector object -- which can be queried with "<b>query_vector()</b>"

           Note:  normally  you'd  use  the  <b>computed()</b>  constructor,  rather  than building these by hand using
           "new()".

       <b>copy()</b>
           Creates a new computed vector object referring to the same source vector and using the same filter as
           this one.

               my $v1 = vector(1,2,3);
               my $c1 = computed($v1); $c1-&gt;set_filter(my $s = sub {});

               my $copy1 = computed($v1); $copy1-&gt;set_filter($s);
               my $copy2 = $c1-&gt;copy; # just like $c2, but in one step

           To instead create a filtered version of a filtered vector, choose this form:

               my $v1 = vector(1,2,3);
               my $c1 = computed($v1); $c1-&gt;set_filter(sub {});
               my $c2 = computed($c1); $c2-&gt;set_filter(sub {});

       <b>insert()</b>
           Insert new values into the input vector.  If the vector was already  full  (see  "<b>set_size()</b>"),  this
           will also shift oldest elements from the input vector to compensate.

               $computed-&gt;insert( 4, 3 ); # insert a 3 and a 4

           Note  that  continuing  from the "SYNOPSIS" example, this would certainly insert a 4 and a 3 into the
           input vector, but the 3 wouldn't be returned from a "<b>query()</b>" because it is odd.

           This function returns the object itself, for chaining purposes.

       <b>append()</b> <b>ginsert()</b>
           Insert new values into the input vector.  If the vector was already full  (see  "<b>set_size()</b>"),  these
           functions  will grow the size of the input vector to accommodate the new values, rather than shifting
           things.

               $computed-&gt;append( 4, 3 ); # append a 3 and a 4

           Note that continuing from the "SYNOPSIS" example, this would certainly insert a 4 and a  3  into  the
           input vector, but the 3 wouldn't be returned from a "<b>query()</b>" because it is odd.

           This function returns the object itself, for chaining purposes.

       <b>query()</b>
           "query()"  returns  the  contents  of the computed vector (after filtering) either as a list or as an
           arrayref.

               my @copy_of_contents      = $computed-&gt;query;
               my $reference_to_contents = $computed-&gt;query;

           Note that changing the $reference_to_contents will not usefully affect the  contents  of  the  vector
           itself, but it will adversely affect any computations based on the vector.  If you need to change the
           contents of a vector in a special way, use another Statistics::Basic::ComputedVector object instead.

           Keeping  $reference_to_contents  available  long  term should work acceptably (since it refers to the
           vector contents itself).

       <b>query_vector()</b>
           Return the input Statistics::Basic::Vector object.

       <b>query_filled()</b>
           This returns true when the input vector is full (see "<b>query_filled()</b>" in  Statistics::Basic::Vector).
           This  is  of  questionable  usefulness  on  computed  vectors,  but is provided for completeness (and
           internal package consistency).

       <b>query_size()</b>
           Return the current size of the computed vector.

       <b>set_filter()</b>
           Set the filtering for the computed vector.  This function takes a  single  coderef  argument  --  all
           other  arguments will be ignored.  The elements of the input vector are passed to your filter coderef
           in @_ and your ref should return the calculated elements of the computed vector as a list.

               my $vec = vector(1,2,3);
               my $pow = computed($vec);
                  $pow-&gt;set_filter(sub { return map { $_ ** 2 } @_ })

           If you need to call more than one  filter  function,  concatenate  them  together  using  map  or  an
           anonymous sub.

               $pow-&gt;set_filter(sub { return f1(f2(f3(f4(@_)))) });

           This function returns the object itself, for chaining purposes.

       <b>set_size()</b>
           Set the size of the input vector (not the computed vector, that would make little sense).

           This function returns the object itself, for chaining purposes.

       <b>set_vector()</b>
           Set the contents of the input vector (not the computed one).

           This function returns the object itself, for chaining purposes.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLOADS</b></h4><pre>
       This  object is overloaded.  It tries to return an appropriate string for the vector and raises errors in
       numeric context.

       In boolean context, this object is always true (even when empty).
