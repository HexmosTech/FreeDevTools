</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       OPENSSL_ia32cap - the x86[_64] processor capabilities vector

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        env OPENSSL_ia32cap=... &lt;application&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       OpenSSL supports a range of x86[_64] instruction set extensions and features. These extensions are
       denoted by individual bits or groups of bits stored internally as ten 32-bit capability vectors and for
       simplicity represented logically below as five 64-bit vectors. This logical vector (LV) representation is
       used to streamline the definition of the OPENSSL_ia32cap environment variable.

       Upon toolkit initialization, the capability vectors are populated through successive executions of the
       CPUID instruction, after which any OPENSSL_ia32cap environment variable capability bit modifications are
       applied. After toolkit initialization is complete, populated vectors are then used to choose between
       different code paths to provide optimal performance across a wide range of x86[_64] based processors.

       Further CPUID information can be found in the Intel(R) Architecture Instruction Set Extensions
       Programming Reference, and the AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual (Volume 3).

   <b>OPENSSL_ia32cap</b> <b>environment</b> <b>variable</b>
       The  <b>OPENSSL_ia32cap</b>  environment variable provides a mechanism to override the default capability vector
       values at library initialization time.  The variable consists of a series of 64-bit numbers  representing
       each   of   the   logical   vectors   (LV)   described   above.   Each  value  is  delimited  by  a  '<b>:</b>'.
       Decimal/Octal/Hexadecimal values representations are supported.

       "env OPENSSL_ia32cap=LV0:LV1:LV2:LV3:LV4"

       Used in this form, each non-null logical vector will  *overwrite*  the  entire  corresponding  capability
       vector  pair  with  the  provided  value.  To  keep  compatibility  with  the  behaviour  of the original
       OPENSSL_ia32cap environment variable &lt;env OPENSSL_ia32cap=LV0:LV1&gt;, the next capability vector pairs will
       be set to zero.

       To illustrate, the following will zero all capability bits in logical vectors 1 and further (disable  all
       post-AVX extensions):

       "env OPENSSL_ia32cap=:0"

       The following will zero all capability bits in logical vectors 2 and further:

       "env OPENSSL_ia32cap=::0"

       The following will zero all capability bits only in logical vector 1: "env OPENSSL_ia32cap=:0::::"

       A  more likely usage scenario would be to disable specific instruction set extensions.  The '<b>~</b>' character
       is used to specify a bit mask of the extensions to be disabled for a particular logical vector.

       To illustrate, the following will disable AVX2 code paths and further extensions:

       "env OPENSSL_ia32cap=:~0x20000000000"

       The following will disable AESNI (LV0 bit 57) and VAES (LV1 bit 41) extensions  and  therefore  any  code
       paths using those extensions but leave the rest of the logical vectors unchanged:

       "env OPENSSL_ia32cap=~0x200000000000000:~0x20000000000:~0x0:~0x0:~0x0"

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Not  all  capability  bits are copied from CPUID output verbatim. An example of this is the somewhat less
       intuitive clearing of LV0 bit #28, or ~0x10000000 in  the  "environment  variable"  terms.  It  has  been
       adjusted  to reflect whether or not the data cache is actually shared between logical cores. This in turn
       affects the decision on whether  or  not  expensive  countermeasures  against  cache-timing  attacks  are
       applied, most notably in AES assembler module.
