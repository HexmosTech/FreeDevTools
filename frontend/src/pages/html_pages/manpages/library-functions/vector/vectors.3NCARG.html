</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Vectors - Utility for creating a vector field plot given two arrays containing the vector components on a
       uniform grid. In addition, the user may pass in another array of scalar data defined over the same grid
       space independent of but presumably related in some fashion to the vector data. The utility will then
       color each vector based on the scalar value at the grid point. Alternatively, the user can choose to
       color the vectors based on vector magnitude.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The following two calls are the minimum required to create a vector field plot using the current
       interface:

       •      VVINIT  -  Performs  the  initialization  required  for  VVECTR  to interpret the input array data
              properly. VVINIT stores the data array sizes, sets up  various  coordinate  system  mappings,  and
              processes  the  input arrays to find the maximum and minimum values. If vector coloring is enabled
              and the user has not explicitly taken control, the routine establishes  a  linearly  scaled  color
              threshold array.

       •      VVECTR - Renders the vectors based on conditions established by VVINIT and the current values of a
              set of user-modifiable internal parameters associated with the Vectors utility.

       All  user-modifiable  internal  parameters  have  default  values;  only  those  which are to have values
       different from the default need to be set. The routines used to set Vectors parameters are as follows:

       •      VVRSET - Resets all internal parameters to their default values.

       •      VVSETC - Assigns a value of type CHARACTER to a parameter.

       •      VVSETI - Assigns a value of type INTEGER to a parameter.

       •      VVSETR - Assigns a value of type REAL to a parameter.

       In general, once a parameter is given a value by a call to one of these routines, it retains  that  value
       until  a  similar  call  resets  it.   Retrieve  the value of an internal parameter by calling one of the
       following routines:

       •      VVGETC - Returns a parameter value of type CHARACTER.

       •      VVGETI - Returns a parameter value of type INTEGER.

       •      VVGETR - Returns a parameter value of type REAL.

       •

       Vectors  supports  three  obsolete  routines  for  compatibility  with  old  NCAR  Graphics  codes.   The
       compatibility  mode  parameter,  CPM,  offers  a number of options that allow considerable flexibility in
       making the transition to the new version of the utility. When writing new code you are encouraged not  to
       use  these  entry points, since they provide less capability than the standard Vectors interface, and may
       eventually be phased out.

       •      VELVCT - The principal entry point prior to Version 3.2, now a  front  end  to  the  VVINIT/VVECTR
              interface.

       •      EZVEC - Front end to VELVCT: a simpler interface for standard situations, when detailed control of
              the plot is not required.

       •      VELVEC  - Older version of VELVCT and now also a front end to it.  It differs from the VELVCT call
              only in that it contains one less input argument in its calling sequence.

</pre><h4><b>USER-MODIFIABLE</b> <b>INTERNAL</b> <b>ROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       The following routines are not to be called directly. However, you may modify them in order to  customize
       the  behavior  of  Vectors.  VVUMXY  is  provided to support user-defined mapping transformations. VVUDMV
       allows you to tailor vector masking to your requirements.

       •      VVUMXY - Performs a user-definable mapping of vector position and direction from  data  coordinate
              space to normalized device coordinate space.

       •      VVUDMV  - The default name of a routine used to draw vectors masked to an area map. VVUDMV decides
              which segments of a vector to draw depending on the area group and group identifier arrays  passed
              to it.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use Vectors, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       In this section are listed, in alphabetical order, all the error messages that may be written by Vectors.
       Each  error  message  begins  with  the  name of the Vectors routine in which an error has been detected,
       followed by a dash, followed by the error message itself. These error messages are written by a  call  to
       the  error-handling  support  routine SETER, with a final argument indicating that the error is fatal and
       that execution should be terminated.

       VVECTR - TOO MANY AREA GROUPS
              The area map passed as the argument, IAM, to VVECTR contains more area groups than allowed by  the
              Vectors  utility,  currently 64. This error can occur only if the Mask to Area Map parameter, MSK,
              has a value greater than 0, specifying that vectors are to be drawn masked to an area map.

       VVECTR - INVALID AREA MAP
              The area map passed as the argument, IAM, to VVECTR is judged to be invalid because it contains  a
              negative  value  for  the number of area groups. This error can occur only if the Mask to Area Map
              parameter, MSK, has a value greater than 0, specifying that vectors are to be drawn masked  to  an
              area map.

       VVGETC - PARAMETER NAME NOT KNOWN - x
              The given parameter name (´x´) is not a legal parameter name known to Vectors.

       VVGETC - PARAMETER NAME TOO SHORT - x
              The parameter name ("x") is less than three characters long.

       VVGETI OR VVGETR - GETTING x - PAI INCORRECT
              An  attempt has been made to get an element of the parameter array named ´x´ and the current value
              of PAI (the "parameter array index") is inappropriate for that parameter array.

       VVGETI OR VVGETR - PARAMETER NAME NOT KNOWN - x
              The given parameter name (´x´) is not a legal parameter name known to Vectors.

       VVGETI OR VVGETR - PARAMETER NAME TOO SHORT - x
              The parameter name ("x") is less than three characters long.

       VVINIT - U AND/OR V ARRAY DIMENSIONS EXCEEDED
              The VVINIT input argument, M, specifying the number of array  elements  to  use  along  the  first
              dimension  of  the U and V (and possibly P) arrays, exceeds the actual first dimension of U and/or
              V, as specified by the input arguments LU and LV.

       VVINIT - SCALAR ARRAY TOO SMALL
              The value given to LP, the VVINIT input argument specifying the  actual  first  dimension  of  the
              scalar  data  array, P, is less than M, the input argument specifying the number of array elements
              to use along the first dimension for all of the input arrays. This error can only occur  when  the
              absolute  value  of the Color Threshold Level control parameter, CTV, is set to 2, indicating that
              coloring is to be performed according to values contained in the scalar data array, P.

       VVSETC - PARAMETER NAME NOT KNOWN - x
              The given parameter name (´x´) is not a legal parameter name known to Vectors.

       VVSETC - PARAMETER NAME TOO SHORT - x
              The parameter name ("x") is less than three characters long.

       VVSETI OR VVSETR - PARAMETER NAME NOT KNOWN - x
              The given parameter name (´x´) is not a legal parameter name known to Vectors.

       VVSETI OR VVSETR - PARAMETER NAME TOO SHORT - x
              The parameter name ("x") is less than three characters long.

       VVSETI OR VVSETR - PARAMETER VALUE OUT OF RANGE - x
              An attempt has been made to set the parameter named ´x´ to a value outside the  range  allowed  by
              the Vectors utility.

       VVSETI OR VVSETR - SETTING x - PAI INCORRECT
              An  attempt has been made to set an element of the parameter array named ´x´ and the current value
              of PAI (the "parameter array index") is inappropriate for that parameter array.
