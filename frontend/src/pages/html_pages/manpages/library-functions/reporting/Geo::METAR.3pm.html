</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Geo::METAR - Process aviation weather reports in the METAR format.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Geo::METAR;
         use strict;

         my $m = new Geo::METAR;
         $m-&gt;metar("KFDY 251450Z 21012G21KT 8SM OVC065 04/M01 A3010 RMK 57014");
         print $m-&gt;dump;

         exit;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       METAR reports are available on-line, thanks to the National Weather Service.  Since reading the METAR
       format isn't easy for non-pilots, these reports are relatively useles to the common man who just wants a
       quick glace at the weather. This module tries to parse the METAR reports so the data can be used to
       create readable weather reports and/or process the data in applications.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>How</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b>
       Here is how you <u>might</u> use the Geo::METAR module.

       One use that I have had for this module is to query the NWS METAR page (using the LWP modules) at:

       <u><a href="http://weather.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/mgetmetar.pl">http://weather.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/mgetmetar.pl</a>?cccc=EHSB</u>

       to get an up-to-date METAR. Then, I scan thru the output, looking for what looks like a METAR string
       (that's not hard in Perl). Oh, EHSB can be any site location code where there is a reporting station.

       I then pass the METAR into this module and get the info I want. I can then update my webcam page with the
       current temperature, sky conditions, or whatnot. See for yourself at <a href="http://webcam.idefix.net/">http://webcam.idefix.net/</a>

       See the BUGS section for a remark about multiple passes with the same Geo::METAR object.

   <b>Functions</b>
       The following functions are defined in the METAR module. Most of them are <u>public</u>, meaning that you're
       supposed to use them. Some are <u>private</u>, meaning that you're not supposed to use them -- but I won't stop
       you. Assume that functions are <u>public</u> unless otherwise documented.

       <b>metar()</b>
           <b>metar()</b>  is  the function to whwich you should pass a METAR string.  It will take care of decomposing
           it into its component parts converting the units and so on.

           Example: "$m-&gt;metar("KFDY 251450Z 21012G21KT 8SM OVC065 04/M01 A3010 RMK 57014");"

       <b>debug()</b>
           <b>debug()</b> toggles debugging messages. By default, debugging is turned  <b>off</b>.  Turn  it  on  if  you  are
           developing METAR or having trouble with it.

           <b>debug()</b> understands all of the following:

                   Enable       Disable
                   ------       -------
                     1             0
                   'yes'         'no'
                   'on'          'off'

           If you contact me for help, I'll likely ask you for some debugging output.

           Example: "$m-&gt;<a href="../man1/debug.1.html">debug</a>(1);"

       <b>dump()</b>
           <b>dump()</b> will dump the internal data structure for the METAR in a semi-human readable format.

           Example: "$m-&gt;dump;"

       <b>version()</b>
           <b>version()</b> will print out the current version.

           Example: "print $m-&gt;version;"

       <b>_tokenize()</b>
           <b>PRIVATE</b>

           Called internally to break the METAR into its component tokens.

       <b>_process()</b>
           <b>PRIVATE</b>

           Used to make sense of the tokens found in <b>_tokenize()</b>.

   <b>Variables</b>
       After  you've  called  <b>metar()</b>,  you'd  probably  like  to  get  at the individual values for things like
       temperature, dew point, and so on. You do that by accessing individual variables via the METAR object.

       This section lists those variables and what they represent.

       If you call <b>dump()</b>, you'll find that it spits all of these out.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Test suite is small and incomplete. Needs work yet.

       Older versions of this module were installed as "METAR" instaed of "Geo::METAR"

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The Geo::METAR is only initialized once, which means you'll get left-over crud in variables when you call
       the <b>metar()</b> function twice.

       What is an invalid METAR in one country is a standard one in the next.  The standard is  interpreted  and
       used  by meteorologists all over the world, with local variations. This means there will always be METARs
       that will trip the parser.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       There is a TODO file included in the Geo::METAR distribution listing the  outstanding  tasks  that  I  or
       others  have  devised.  Please check that list before you submit a bug report or request a new feture. It
       might already be on the TODO list.
