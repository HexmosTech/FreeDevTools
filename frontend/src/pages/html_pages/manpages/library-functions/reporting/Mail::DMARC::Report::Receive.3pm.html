</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mail::DMARC::Report::Receive - process incoming DMARC reports

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.20240314

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Receive DMARC reports and save them to the report store/database.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>from_imap,</b> <b>from_file,</b> <b>from_mbox</b>
       These methods are called by dmarc_receive program, which has its own documentation and usage
       instructions. The methods accept a message (or list of messages) and create an Email::Simple object from
       each, passing that object to from_email_simple.

   <b>from_email_simple</b>
       Accepts an Email::Simple message object. Returns the type of DMARC report detected or undef if no DMARC
       report was detected.

       When forensic reports are detected, no further processing is done.

       When an aggregate report is detected, the report details are extracted from the message body as well as
       the Subject field/header and attachment metadata.

       Parsing of the Subject and MIME metadata is necessary because the 2013 draft DMARC specification does not
       REQUIRE the envelope_to domain name to be included in the XML report. For example, the only way to <b>know</b>
       that the email which generated this particular report was sent to hotmail.com is to extract the
       envelope_to domain from the message metadata (Org Name=Microsoft, hotmail.com is not in the XML). So far,
       every messsage I have seen has had the envelope_to domain in one location or the other.

       To extract messages from the message body, the MIME attachments are decompressed and passed to
       handle_body.

   <b>handle_body</b>
       Accepts a XML message, parsing it with XML::LibXML and XPath expressions. The parsed data is stored in a
       Mail::DMARC::Report object. When the parsing is complete, the report object is saved to the report store.
