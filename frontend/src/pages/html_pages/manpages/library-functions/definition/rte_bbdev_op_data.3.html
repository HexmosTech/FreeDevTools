   <b>struct</b> <b>rte_mbuf*</b> <b>data</b>
       The mbuf data structure representing the data for BBDEV operation.

       This mbuf pointer can point to one Code Block (CB) data buffer or multiple CBs contiguously located next
       to each other. A Transport Block (TB) represents a whole piece of data that is divided into one or more
       CBs. Maximum number of CBs can be contained in one TB is defined by
       RTE_BBDEV_(TURBO/LDPC)_MAX_CODE_BLOCKS.

       An mbuf data structure cannot represent more than one TB. The smallest piece of data that can be
       contained in one mbuf is one CB. An mbuf can include one contiguous CB, subset of contiguous CBs that are
       belonging to one TB, or all contiguous CBs that are belonging to one TB.

       If a BBDEV PMD supports the extended capability 'Scatter-Gather', then it is capable of collecting
       (gathering) non-contiguous (scattered) data from multiple locations in the memory. This capability is
       reported by the capability flags:

       • RTE_BBDEV_(TURBO/LDPC)_ENC_SCATTER_GATHER and

       • RTE_BBDEV_(TURBO/LDPC)_DEC_SCATTER_GATHER. Only if a BBDEV PMD supports this feature, chained mbuf data
         structures  are accepted. A chained mbuf can represent one non-contiguous CB or multiple non-contiguous
         CBs. If BBDEV PMD does not support this feature, it will assume inbound mbuf data contains one segment.

       The output mbuf data though is always one segment, even if the input was a chained mbuf.

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>offset</b>
       The starting point of the BBDEV (encode/decode) operation, in bytes.

       BBDEV starts to read data past this offset. In case of chained mbuf, this  offset  applies  only  to  the
       first mbuf segment.

       Definition at line <b>312</b> of file <b>rte_bbdev_op.h</b>.

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>length</b>
       The total data length to be processed in one operation, in bytes.

       In  case  the mbuf data is representing one CB, this is the length of the CB undergoing the operation. If
       it's for multiple CBs, this is the total length of those CBs undergoing the operation. If it is  for  one
       TB, this is the total length of the TB under operation.

       In  case  of  chained  mbuf,  this  data  length  includes  the  lengths of the 'scattered' data segments
       undergoing the operation.
