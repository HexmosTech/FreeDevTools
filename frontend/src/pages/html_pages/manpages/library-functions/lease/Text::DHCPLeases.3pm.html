</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Text::DHCPLeases - Parse DHCP leases file from ISC dhcpd.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Text::DHCPLeases;

           my $leases = Text::DHCPLeases-&gt;new("/etc/dhcpd.leases");

           foreach my $obj ( $leases-&gt;get_objects ){
               print $obj-&gt;name;
               if ( $obj-&gt;binding_state eq 'active' ){
                  ...
           }
           ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides an object-oriented interface to ISC DHCPD leases files.  The goal is to objectify
       all declarations, as defined by the ISC dhcpd package man pages.

       This interface is useful for analyzing, reporting, converting lease files, or as a tool for other
       applications that need to import dhcpd lease data structures.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>-</b> <b>Class</b> <b>Constructor</b>
         Arguments:
           Hash with the following keys:
           file  -  Leases file path
         Returns:
           Text::DHCPLeases object
         Examples:
           Text::DHCPLeases-&gt;new(file=&gt;"/etc/dhcpd.leases");

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>get_objects</b> <b>-</b> <b>Get</b> <b>objects</b> <b>from</b> <b>leases</b> <b>file</b>
         Arguments:
           Object attributes to match (optional)
         Returns:
           Array of Text::DHCPLeases::Lease objects,
           or iterator depending on context.
         Examples:
           my $it = $leases-&gt;get_objects(ip_address=&gt;'192.168.0.1');
           while ( my $obj = $it-&gt;next ) ...

   <b>print</b> <b>-</b> <b>Print</b> <b>all</b> <b>lease</b> <b>objects</b> <b>contents</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>formatted</b> <b>string</b>
         Arguments:
           None
         Returns:
           Formatted String
         Examples:
           print $leases-&gt;print;

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Correct parsing of leases files depends on changes made to the format of said files by the authors of the
       ISC DHCPD package.  This module was tested against leases files generated by ISC DHCPD version 3.1.0.  In
       addition, I do not have access to leases file with all possible declarations and statements, so parsing
       could be broken in some circumstances.  Patches are welcome.

       No bugs have been reported.
