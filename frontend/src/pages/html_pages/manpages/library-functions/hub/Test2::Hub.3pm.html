</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test2::Hub - The conduit through which all events flow.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Test2::Hub;

           my $hub = Test2::Hub-&gt;new();
           $hub-&gt;send(...);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The hub is the place where all events get processed and handed off to the formatter. The hub also tracks
       test state, and provides several hooks into the event pipeline.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>TASKS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>SENDING</b> <b>EVENTS</b>
           $hub-&gt;send($event)

       The send() method is used to issue an event to the hub. This method will handle thread/fork sync,
       filters, listeners, TAP output, etc.

   <b>ALTERING</b> <b>OR</b> <b>REMOVING</b> <b>EVENTS</b>
       You can use either filter() or pre_filter(), depending on your needs. Both have identical syntax, so only
       filter() is shown here.

           $hub-&gt;filter(sub {
               my ($hub, $event) = @_;

               my $action = get_action($event);

               # No action should be taken
               return $event if $action eq 'none';

               # You want your filter to remove the event
               return undef if $action eq 'delete';

               if ($action eq 'do_it') {
                   my $new_event = copy_event($event);
                   ... Change your copy of the event ...
                   return $new_event;
               }

               die "Should not happen";
           });

       By default, filters are not inherited by child hubs. That means if you start a subtest, the subtest will
       not inherit the filter. You can change this behavior with the "inherit" parameter:

           $hub-&gt;filter(sub { ... }, inherit =&gt; 1);

   <b>LISTENING</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>EVENTS</b>
           $hub-&gt;listen(sub {
               my ($hub, $event, $number) = @_;

               ... do whatever you want with the event ...

               # return is ignored
           });

       By default listeners are not inherited by child hubs. That means if you start a subtest, the subtest will
       not inherit the listener. You can change this behavior with the "inherit" parameter:

           $hub-&gt;listen(sub { ... }, inherit =&gt; 1);

   <b>POST-TEST</b> <b>BEHAVIORS</b>
           $hub-&gt;follow_up(sub {
               my ($trace, $hub) = @_;

               ... do whatever you need to ...

               # Return is ignored
           });

       follow_up subs are called only once, either when done_testing is called, or in an END block.

   <b>SETTING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>FORMATTER</b>
       By default an instance of Test2::Formatter::TAP is created and used.

           my $old = $hub-&gt;format(My::Formatter-&gt;new);

       Setting the formatter will REPLACE any existing formatter. You may set the formatter to undef to prevent
       output. The old formatter will be returned if one was already set. Only one formatter is allowed at a
       time.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $hub-&gt;send($event)
           This is where all events enter the hub for processing.

       $hub-&gt;process($event)
           This  is  called  by send after it does any IPC handling. You can use this to bypass the IPC process,
           but in general you should avoid using this.

       $old = $hub-&gt;format($formatter)
           Replace the existing formatter instance with a new one. Formatters must be objects that  implement  a
           "$formatter-&gt;write($event)" method.

       $sub = $hub-&gt;listen(sub { ... }, %optional_params)
           You  can  use  this  to record all events AFTER they have been sent to the formatter. No changes made
           here will be meaningful, except possibly to other listeners.

               $hub-&gt;listen(sub {
                   my ($hub, $event, $number) = @_;

                   ... do whatever you want with the event ...

                   # return is ignored
               });

           Normally listeners are not inherited by child hubs such as subtests. You can add the "inherit  =&gt;  1"
           parameter to allow a listener to be inherited.

       $hub-&gt;unlisten($sub)
           You  can  use this to remove a listen callback. You must pass in the coderef returned by the listen()
           method.

       $sub = $hub-&gt;filter(sub { ... }, %optional_params)
       $sub = $hub-&gt;pre_filter(sub { ... }, %optional_params)
           These can be used to add filters. Filters can modify, replace, or remove events before anything  else
           can see them.

               $hub-&gt;filter(
                   sub {
                       my ($hub, $event) = @_;

                       return $event;    # No Changes
                       return;           # Remove the event

                       # Or you can modify an event before returning it.
                       $event-&gt;modify;
                       return $event;
                   }
               );

           If  you  are  not  using  threads,  forking, or IPC then the only difference between a "filter" and a
           "pre_filter" is that "pre_filter" subs run first. When  you  are  using  threads,  forking,  or  IPC,
           pre_filters  happen to events before they are sent to their destination proc/thread, ordinary filters
           happen only in the destination hub/thread.

           You cannot add a regular filter to a hub if the hub was created in another process or thread. You can
           always add a pre_filter.

       $hub-&gt;unfilter($sub)
       $hub-&gt;pre_unfilter($sub)
           These can be used to remove filters and pre_filters. The $sub argument is the reference  returned  by
           filter() or pre_filter().

       $hub-&gt;follow_op(sub { ... })
           Use this to add behaviors that are called just before the hub is finalized. The only argument to your
           codeblock will be a Test2::EventFacet::Trace instance.

               $hub-&gt;follow_up(sub {
                   my ($trace, $hub) = @_;

                   ... do whatever you need to ...

                   # Return is ignored
               });

           follow_up subs are called only once, ether when done_testing is called, or in an END block.

       $sub = $hub-&gt;add_context_acquire(sub { ... });
           Add  a  callback  that will be called every time someone tries to acquire a context. It gets a single
           argument, a reference of the hash of parameters being used the construct the context.  This  is  your
           chance to change the parameters by directly altering the hash.

               test2_add_callback_context_acquire(sub {
                   my $params = shift;
                   $params-&gt;{level}++;
               });

           This  is  a  very  scary  API  function. Please do not use this unless you need to.  This is here for
           Test::Builder and backwards compatibility. This has you  directly  manipulate  the  hash  instead  of
           returning a new one for performance reasons.

           <b>Note</b> Using this hook could have a huge performance impact.

           The coderef you provide is returned and can be used to remove the hook later.

       $hub-&gt;remove_context_acquire($sub);
           This can be used to remove a context acquire hook.

       $sub = $hub-&gt;add_context_init(sub { ... });
           This  allows  you to add callbacks that will trigger every time a new context is created for the hub.
           The only argument to the sub will be the Test2::API::Context instance that was created.

           <b>Note</b> Using this hook could have a huge performance impact.

           The coderef you provide is returned and can be used to remove the hook later.

       $hub-&gt;remove_context_init($sub);
           This can be used to remove a context init hook.

       $sub = $hub-&gt;add_context_release(sub { ... });
           This allows you to add callbacks that will trigger every time a context for this hub is released. The
           only argument to the sub will be the Test2::API::Context instance that was released. These  will  run
           in reverse order.

           <b>Note</b> Using this hook could have a huge performance impact.

           The coderef you provide is returned and can be used to remove the hook later.

       $hub-&gt;remove_context_release($sub);
           This can be used to remove a context release hook.

       $hub-&gt;<b>cull()</b>
           Cull any IPC events (and process them).

       $pid = $hub-&gt;<b>pid()</b>
           Get the process id under which the hub was created.

       $tid = $hub-&gt;<b>tid()</b>
           Get the thread id under which the hub was created.

       $hud = $hub-&gt;<b>hid()</b>
           Get the identifier string of the hub.

       $uuid = $hub-&gt;<b>uuid()</b>
           If UUID tagging is enabled (see Test2::API) then the hub will have a UUID.

       $ipc = $hub-&gt;<b>ipc()</b>
           Get the IPC object used by the hub.

       $hub-&gt;set_no_ending($bool)
       $bool = $hub-&gt;no_ending
           This  can be used to disable auto-ending behavior for a hub. The auto-ending behavior is triggered by
           an end block and is used to cull IPC events, and output the final plan if the plan was 'NO PLAN'.

       $bool = $hub-&gt;active
       $hub-&gt;set_active($bool)
           These  are  used  to  get/set  the  'active'  attribute.  When  true  this   attribute   will   force
           "hub-&gt;finalize()"  to  take action even if there is no plan, and no tests have been run. This flag is
           useful for plugins that add follow-up behaviors that need to run even if no events are seen.

   <b>STATE</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       $hub-&gt;<b>reset_state()</b>
           Reset all state to the start. This sets the test count to 0, clears the plan, removes  the  failures,
           etc.

       $num = $hub-&gt;count
           Get the number of tests that have been run.

       $num = $hub-&gt;failed
           Get the number of failures (Not all failures come from a test fail, so this number can be larger than
           the count).

       $bool = $hub-&gt;ended
           True  if  the testing has ended. This MAY return the stack frame of the tool that ended the test, but
           that is not guaranteed.

       $bool = $hub-&gt;is_passing
       $hub-&gt;is_passing($bool)
           Check if the overall test run is a failure. Can also be used to set the pass/fail status.

       $hub-&gt;plan($plan)
       $plan = $hub-&gt;plan
           Get or set the plan. The plan must be an integer larger than 0, the string 'NO PLAN', or  the  string
           'SKIP'.

       $bool = $hub-&gt;check_plan
           Check  if  the  plan and counts match, but only if the tests have ended. If tests have not ended this
           will return undef, otherwise it will be a true/false.
