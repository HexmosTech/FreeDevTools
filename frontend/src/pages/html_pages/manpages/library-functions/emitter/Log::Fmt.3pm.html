</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Log::Fmt - a little parser and emitter of structured log lines

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 3.009

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       This library primarily exists to service Log::Dispatchouli's "log_event" methods.  It converts an
       arrayref of key/value pairs to a string that a human can scan tolerably well, and which a machine can
       parse about as well.  It can also do that tolerably-okay parsing for you.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>format_event_string</b>
         my $string = Log::Fmt-&gt;format_event_string([
           key1 =&gt; $value1,
           key2 =&gt; $value2,
         ]);

       Note especially that if any value to encode is a reference <u>to</u> <u>a</u> <u>reference</u>, then String::Flogger is used
       to encode the referenced value.  This means you can embed, in your logfmt, a JSON dump of a structure by
       passing a reference to the structure, instead of passing the structure itself.

   <b>parse_event_string</b>
         my $kv_pairs = Log::Fmt-&gt;parse_event_string($string);

       Given the kind of string emitted by "format_event_string", this method returns a reference to an array of
       key/value pairs.

       This isn't exactly a round trip.  First off, the formatting can change illegal keys by replacing
       characters with question marks, or replacing empty strings with tildes.  Secondly, the formatter will
       expand some values like arrayrefs and hashrefs into multiple keys, but the parser will not recombined
       those keys into structures.  Also, there might be other asymmetric conversions.  That said, the string
       escaping done by the formatter should correctly reverse.

       If the input string is badly formed, hunks that don't appear to be value key/value pairs will be
       presented as values for the key "junk".

   <b>parse_event_string_as_hash</b>
           my $hashref = Log::Fmt-&gt;parse_event_string_as_hash($line);

       This parses the given line as logfmt, then puts the key/value pairs into a hash and returns a reference
       to it.

       Because nothing prevents a single key from appearing more than once, you should use this with the
       understanding that data could be lost.  No guarantee is made of which value will be preserved.
