       Pithub::Orgs::Teams - Github v3 Org Teams API

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.01043

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>add_member</b>
           The "Add team member" API (described below) is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in the next
           major version of the API. We recommend using the Add team membership API instead. It allows you to
           invite new organization members to your teams.

           In order to add a user to a team, the authenticated user must have 'admin' permissions to the team or
           be an owner of the org that the team is associated with.

               PUT /teams/:id/members/:user

           Examples:

               my $t = Pithub::Orgs::Teams-&gt;new;
               my $result = $t-&gt;add_member(
                   team_id =&gt; 1,
                   user    =&gt; 'plu',
               );

   <b>add_membership</b>
           If the user is already a member of the team's organization, this endpoint will add the user to the
           team. In order to add a membership between an organization member and a team, the authenticated user
           must be an organization owner or a maintainer of the team.

               PUT /teams/:id/memberships/:user

           Examples:

               my $t = Pithub::Orgs::Teams-&gt;new;
               my $result = $t-&gt;add_membership(
                   team_id =&gt; 1,
                   user    =&gt; 'plu',
                   data    =&gt; {
                       role =&gt; 'member',
                   }
               );

   <b>add_repo</b>
           In order to add a repo to a team, the authenticated user must be an owner of the org that the team is
           associated with.

               PUT /teams/:id/repos/:repo

           Examples:

               my $t = Pithub::Orgs::Teams-&gt;new;
               my $result = $t-&gt;add_repo(
                   team_id =&gt; 1,
                   repo    =&gt; 'some_repo',
                   org =&gt; 'our_organization',
               );

   <b>create</b>
           In order to create a team, the authenticated user must be an owner of the given organization.

               POST /orgs/:org/teams

           Examples:

               my $t = Pithub::Orgs::Teams-&gt;new;
               my $result = $t-&gt;create(
                   org  =&gt; 'CPAN-API',
                   data =&gt; {
                       name       =&gt; 'new team',
                       permission =&gt; 'push',
                       repo_names =&gt; ['github/dotfiles']
