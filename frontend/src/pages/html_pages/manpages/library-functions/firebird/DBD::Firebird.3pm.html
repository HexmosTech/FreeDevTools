</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBD::Firebird - DBI driver for Firebird RDBMS server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use DBI;

         $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Firebird:db=$dbname", $user, $password);

         # See the DBI module documentation for full details

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       DBD::Firebird is a Perl module which works with the DBI module to provide access to Firebird databases.

</pre><h4><b>MODULE</b> <b>DOCUMENTATION</b></h4><pre>
       This documentation describes driver specific behavior and restrictions.  It is not supposed to be used as
       the only reference for the user. In any case consult the DBI documentation first !

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>DBI</b> <b>CLASS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>DBI</b> <b>Class</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <b>connect</b>
           To connect to a database with a minimum of parameters, use the following syntax:

             $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Firebird:dbname=$dbname", $user, $password);

           If  omitted,  $user defaults to the ISC_USER environment variable (or, failing that, the DBI-standard
           DBI_USER environment variable).  Similarly, $password defaults to  ISC_PASSWORD  (or  DBI_PASS).   If
           $dbname  is  blank,  that  is,  <u>"dbi:Firebird:dbname="</u>,  the  environment  variable  ISC_DATABASE  is
           substituted.

           The DSN may take several optional parameters, which may be split over multiple  lines.   Here  is  an
           example of connect statement which uses all possible parameters:

              $dsn =&lt;&lt; "DSN";
            dbi:Firebird:dbname=$dbname;
            host=$host;
            port=$port;
            ib_dialect=$dialect;
            ib_role=$role;
            ib_charset=$charset;
            ib_cache=$cache;
            ib_db_triggers=0;
            timeout=$timeout
            DSN

            $dbh =  DBI-&gt;connect($dsn, $username, $password);

           The  $dsn  is  prefixed  by  'dbi:Firebird:',  and  consists  of  key-value  parameters  separated by
           <b>semicolons</b>. New line may be added after the semicolon. The following is the list of valid  parameters
           and their respective meanings:

               parameter       meaning                                 optional?
               -----------------------------------------------------------------
               database        path to the database                    required
               dbname          path to the database
               db              path to the database
               hostname        hostname / IP address                   optional
               host            hostname / IP address
               port            port number                             optional
               timeout         connect timeout in seconds              optional
               ib_dialect      the SQL dialect to be used              optional
               ib_role         the role of the user                    optional
               ib_charset      character set to be used                optional
               ib_cache        number of database cache buffers        optional
               ib_dbkey_scope  change default duration of RDB$DB_KEY   optional
               ib_db_triggers  enable/disable database-level triggers  optional
                               defaults to 1 (enabled)

           <b>database</b>  could be used interchangebly with <b>dbname</b> and <b>db</b>.  To connect to a remote host, use the <b>host</b>
           parameter.  Here is an example of DSN to connect to a remote Windows host:

            $dsn = "dbi:Firebird:db=C:/temp/test.gdb;host=example.com;ib_dialect=3";

           Database file alias can be used too in connection string. In  the  following  example,  "billing"  is
           defined in aliases.conf:

            $dsn = 'dbi:Firebird:hostname=192.168.88.5;db=billing;ib_dialect=3';

           Firebird  as  of  version  1.0 listens on port specified within the services file. To connect to port
           other than the default 3050, add the port number at the end of  host  name,  separated  by  a  slash.
           Example:

            $dsn = 'dbi:Firebird:db=/data/test.gdb;host=localhost/3060';

           Firebird 1.0 introduces <b>SQL</b> <b>dialect</b> to provide backward compatibility with databases created by older
           versions of Firebird (pre 1.0). In short, SQL dialect controls how Firebird interprets:

            - double quotes
            - the DATE datatype
            - decimal and numeric datatypes
            - new 1.0 reserved keywords

           Valid values for <b>ib_dialect</b> are 1 and 3 .The driver's default value is 3 (Currently it is possible to
           create  databases  in  Dialect  1  and  3  only,  however  it  is  recommended that you use Dialect 3
           exclusively, since Dialect 1 will eventually be deprecated. Dialect 2 cannot  be  used  to  create  a
           database since it only serves to convert Dialect 1 to Dialect 3).

           <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/reference_manuals/user_manuals/html/isql-dialects.html">http://www.firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/reference_manuals/user_manuals/html/isql-dialects.html</a>

           <b>ib_role</b>  specifies  the  role  of  the  connecting  user. <b>SQL</b> <b>role</b> is implemented by Firebird to make
           database administration easier when dealing with lots of users. A detailed reading can be found at:

            <a href="http://www.ibphoenix.com/resources/documents/general/doc_59">http://www.ibphoenix.com/resources/documents/general/doc_59</a>

           If <b>ib_cache</b> is not specified, the default database's cache size value  will  be  used.  The  Firebird
           Operation  Guide  discusses  in  full  length  the  importance  of  this  parameter  to gain the best
           performance.

       <b>available_drivers</b>
             @driver_names = DBI-&gt;available_drivers;

           Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

       <b>Warn</b> (boolean, inherited)
           Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

       <b>Active</b> (boolean, read-only)
           Supported by the driver as proposed by DBI. A database handle is active while  it  is  connected  and
           statement handle is active until it is finished.

       <b>Kids</b> (integer, read-only)
           Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

       <b>ActiveKids</b> (integer, read-only)

</pre><h4><b>DATABASE</b> <b>HANDLE</b> <b>OBJECTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Database</b> <b>Handle</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <b>selectrow_array</b>
             @row_ary = $dbh-&gt;selectrow_array($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

           Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

       <b>selectall_arrayref</b>
             $ary_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

           Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

       <b>selectcol_arrayref</b>
             $ary_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectcol_arrayref($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

           Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

       <b>prepare</b>
             $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($statement, \%attr);

           Supported  by  the driver as proposed by DBI.  When AutoCommit is On, this method implicitly starts a
           new transaction, which will be automatically committed after the  following  <b>execute()</b>  or  the  last
           <b>fetch()</b>,  depending  on  the  statement type. For select statements, commit automatically takes place
           after the last <b>fetch()</b>, or by explicitly calling <b>finish()</b> method if there are any rows remaining. For
           non-select statements, <b>execute()</b> will implicitly commits the transaction.

       <b>prepare_cached</b>
             $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare_cached($statement, \%attr);

           Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

       <b>do</b>
             $rv  = $dbh-&gt;do($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

           Supported by the driver as proposed by DBI.  This should be used for non-select statements, where the
           driver doesn't take the conservative prepare - execute steps, thereby speeding up the execution time.
           But if this method is used with bind values, the speed advantage  diminishes  as  this  method  calls
           <b>prepare()</b>  for binding the placeholders.  Instead of calling this method repeatedly with bind values,
           it would be better to call <b>prepare()</b> once, and <b>execute()</b> many times.

           See the notes for the execute method elsewhere in this document. Unlike the execute method, currently
           this method doesn't return the number of affected rows.

       <b>commit</b>
             $rc  = $dbh-&gt;commit;

           Supported by the driver as proposed by DBI. See also the notes about <b>Transactions</b> elsewhere  in  this
           document.

       <b>rollback</b>
             $rc  = $dbh-&gt;rollback;

           Supported  by  the driver as proposed by DBI. See also the notes about <b>Transactions</b> elsewhere in this
           document.

       <b>disconnect</b>
             $rc  = $dbh-&gt;disconnect;

           Supported by the driver as proposed by DBI.

       <b>ping</b>
             $rc = $dbh-&gt;ping;

           This driver supports the ping-method, which can be used to check the validity of  a  database-handle.
           This is especially required by "Apache::DBI".

       <b>primary_key_info</b>
             $sth = $dbh-&gt;primary_key_info('', '', $table_name);
             @pks = $dbh-&gt;primary_key('', '', $table_name);

           Supported by the driver as proposed by DBI.  Note that catalog and schema are ignored.

       <b>table_info</b>
             $sth = $dbh-&gt;table_info;

           All  Firebird versions support the basic DBI-specified columns (TABLE_NAME, TABLE_TYPE, etc.) as well
           as "IB_TABLE_OWNER".  Peculiar versions may return additional fields, prefixed by "IB_".

           Table searching may not work as expected on older Interbase/Firebird engines which  do  not  natively
           offer  a  <b>TRIM()</b>  function.  Some engines store TABLE_NAME in a blank-padded CHAR field, and a search
           for table name is performed via a SQL "LIKE" predicate, which is sensitive to blanks.  That is:

             $dbh-&gt;table_info('', '', 'FOO');  # May not find table "FOO", depending on
                                               # FB version
             $dbh-&gt;table_info('', '', 'FOO%'); # Will always find "FOO", but also tables
                                               # "FOOD", "FOOT", etc.

           Future versions of DBD::Firebird may attempt to  work  around  this  irritating  limitation,  at  the
           expense of efficiency.

           Note  that  Firebird  implementations  do  not  presently  support  the DBI concepts of 'catalog' and
           'schema', so these parameters are effectively ignored.

       <b>tables</b>
             @names = $dbh-&gt;tables;

           Returns a list of tables, excluding any 'SYSTEM TABLE' types.

       <b>type_info_all</b>
             $type_info_all = $dbh-&gt;type_info_all;

           Supported by the driver as proposed by DBI.

           For further details concerning the  Firebird  specific  data-types  please  read  the  Firebird  Data
           Definition Guide

           <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/reference-manuals/">http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/reference-manuals/</a>

       <b>type_info</b>
             @type_info = $dbh-&gt;type_info($data_type);

           Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

       <b>quote</b>
             $sql = $dbh-&gt;quote($value, $data_type);

           Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

   <b>Database</b> <b>Handle</b> <b>Attributes</b>
       <b>AutoCommit</b>  (boolean)
           Supported  by  the  driver  as proposed by DBI. According to the classification of DBI, Firebird is a
           database, in which a transaction must be explicitly started. Without starting  a  transaction,  every
           change  to  the  database  becomes  immediately  permanent.  The  default  of AutoCommit is on, which
           corresponds to the DBI's default. When setting AutoCommit to off, a transaction will be  started  and
           every  commit or rollback will automatically start a new transaction. For details see the notes about
           <b>Transactions</b> elsewhere in this document.

       <b>Driver</b>  (handle)
           Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

       <b>Name</b>  (string, read-only)
           Not yet implemented.

       <b>RowCacheSize</b>  (integer)
           Implemented by DBI, not used by the driver.

       <b>ib_softcommit</b>  (driver-specific, boolean)
           Set this attribute to TRUE to use Firebird's soft commit feature  (default  to  FALSE).  Soft  commit
           retains  the  internal  transaction  handle  when  committing a transaction, while the default commit
           behavior always closes and invalidates the transaction handle.

           Since the transaction handle is still open, there is no need to start a new  transaction  upon  every
           commit,  so  applications  can gain performance improvement. Using soft commit is also desirable when
           dealing with nested statement handles under AutoCommit on.

           Switching the attribute's value from TRUE to FALSE will force hard commit thus  closing  the  current
           transaction.

       <b>ib_enable_utf8</b>  (driver-specific, boolean)
           Setting  this  attribute to TRUE will cause any Perl Unicode strings supplied as statement parameters
           to be downgraded to octet sequences before passing them to Firebird.

           Also, any character data retrieved from the database (CHAR, VARCHAR,  BLOB  sub_type  TEXT)  will  be
           upgraded to Perl Unicode strings.

           <b>Caveat</b>:  Currently  this  is supported only if the <b>ib_charset</b> DSN parameter is "UTF8". In the future,
           encoding and decoding to/from arbitrary character set may be implemented.

           Example:

               $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect( 'dbi:Firebird:db=database.fdb;ib_charset=UTF8',
                   { ib_enable_utf8 =&gt; 1 } );

</pre><h4><b>TRANSACTION</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       The  transaction  behavior  is  controlled  with  the attribute AutoCommit.  For a complete definition of
       AutoCommit please refer to the DBI documentation.

       According to the DBI specification the default for AutoCommit is TRUE.  In this mode, any change  to  the
       database becomes valid immediately. Any <b>commit()</b> or <b>rollback()</b> will be rejected.

       If AutoCommit is switched-off, immediately a transaction will be started.  A <b>rollback()</b> will rollback and
       close  the  active  transaction,  then  implicitly  start  a  new  transaction. A disconnect will issue a
       rollback.

       Firebird provides fine control over transaction behavior, where users can specify the  access  mode,  the
       isolation  level,  the  lock  resolution,  and  the  table  reservation (for a specified table). For this
       purpose, ib_set_tx_param() database handle method is available.

       Upon a successful connect(), these default parameter values will be used for every SQL operation:

           Access mode:        read_write
           Isolation level:    snapshot
           Lock resolution:    wait

       Any of the above value can be changed using ib_set_tx_param().

       <b>ib_set_tx_param</b>
            $dbh-&gt;func(
               -access_mode     =&gt; 'read_write',
               -isolation_level =&gt; 'read_committed',
               -lock_resolution =&gt; 'wait',
               'ib_set_tx_param'
            );

           Valid value for "-access_mode" is "read_write", or "read_only".

           Valid value for "-lock_resolution" is "wait", or "no_wait".  In Firebird 2.0,  a  timeout  value  for
           wait is introduced. This can be specified using hash ref as lock_resolution value:

            $dbh-&gt;func(
               -lock_resolution =&gt; { wait =&gt; 5 }, # wait for 5 seconds
               'ib_set_tx_param'
            );

           "-isolation_level" may be: "read_committed", "snapshot", "snapshot_table_stability".

           If  "read_committed"  is to be used with "record_version" or "no_record_version", then they should be
           inside an anonymous array:

            $dbh-&gt;func(
               -isolation_level =&gt; ['read_committed', 'record_version'],
               'ib_set_tx_param'
            );

           Table reservation is supported since "DBD::Firebird 0.30". Names of the tables to reserve as well  as
           their  reservation params/values are specified inside a hashref, which is then passed as the value of
           "-reserving".

           The following example reserves "foo_table" with "read" lock and  "bar_table"  with  "read"  lock  and
           "protected" access:

            $dbh-&gt;func(
               -access_mode     =&gt; 'read_write',
               -isolation_level =&gt; 'read_committed',
               -lock_resolution =&gt; 'wait',
               -reserving       =&gt;
                   {
                       foo_table =&gt; {
                           lock    =&gt; 'read',
                       },
                       bar_table =&gt; {
                           lock    =&gt; 'read',
                           access  =&gt; 'protected',
                       },
                   },
               'ib_set_tx_param'
            );

           Possible table reservation parameters are:

           "access" (optional)
               Valid values are "shared" or "protected".

           "lock" (required)
               Valid values are "read" or "write".

           Under "AutoCommit" mode, invoking this method doesn't only change the transaction parameters (as with
           "AutoCommit"  off),  but also commits the current transaction. The new transaction parameters will be
           used in any newly started transaction.

           ib_set_tx_param() can also be invoked with no parameter in which it resets transaction parameters  to
           the default value.

</pre><h4><b>DATE,</b> <b>TIME,</b> <b>and</b> <b>TIMESTAMP</b> <b>FORMATTING</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       "DBD::Firebird" supports various formats for query results of DATE, TIME, and TIMESTAMP types.

       By  default,  it  uses  "%c"  for  TIMESTAMP, "%x" for DATE, and "%X" for TIME, and pass them to ANSI C's
       <b>strftime()</b>  function  to  format  your  query  results.   These  values  are   respectively   stored   in
       ib_timestampformat, ib_dateformat, and ib_timeformat attributes, and may be changed in two ways:

       •   At $dbh level

           This replaces the default values. Example:

            $dbh-&gt;{ib_timestampformat} = '%m-%d-%Y %H:%M';
            $dbh-&gt;{ib_dateformat} = '%m-%d-%Y';
            $dbh-&gt;{ib_timeformat} = '%H:%M';

       •   At $sth level

           This overrides the default values only for the currently prepared statement.  Example:

            $attr = {
               ib_timestampformat =&gt; '%m-%d-%Y %H:%M',
               ib_dateformat =&gt; '%m-%d-%Y',
               ib_timeformat =&gt; '%H:%M',
            };
            # then, pass it to prepare() method.
            $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($sql, $attr);

       Since  locale  settings  affect  the result of <b>strftime()</b>, if your application is designed to be portable
       across different locales, you may consider using these two special formats: 'TM' and 'ISO'. "TM"  returns
       a   9-element  list,  much  like  Perl's  <b>localtime()</b>.  The  "ISO"  format  applies  <b>sprintf()</b>'s  pattern
       "%04d-%02d-%02d %02d:%02d:%02d.%04d" for TIMESTAMP, "%04d-%02d-%02d" for DATE, and  "%02d:%02d:%02d.%04d"
       for TIME.

       "$dbh-&gt;{ib_time_all}" can be used to specify all of the three formats at once. Example:

        $dbh-&gt;{ib_time_all} = 'TM';

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>ALERT</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Event  alerter  is used to notify client applications whenever something is happened on the database. For
       this to work, a trigger should be created, which then calls POST_EVENT to post the event notification  to
       the interested client. A client could behave in two ways: wait for the event synchronously, or register a
       callback which will be invoked asynchronously each time a posted event received.

       "ib_init_event"
            $evh = $dbh-&gt;func(@event_names, 'ib_init_event');

           Creates an event handle from a list of event names.

       "ib_wait_event"
            $dbh-&gt;func($evh, 'ib_wait_event');

           Wait  synchronously  for  particular  events  registered  via  event  handle $evh.  Returns a hashref
           containing pair(s) of posted event's name and its corresponding count, or undef on failure.

       "ib_register_callback"
            my $cb = sub { my $posted_events = $_[0]; ++$::COUNT &lt; 6 };
            $dbh-&gt;func($evh, $cb, 'ib_register_callback');

            sub inc_count { my $posted_events = shift; ++$::COUNT &lt; 6 };
            $dbh-&gt;func($evh, \&amp;inc_count, 'ib_register_callback');

            # or anonyomus subroutine
            $dbh-&gt;func(
              $evh,
              sub { my ($pe) = @_; ++$::COUNT &lt; 6 },
              'ib_register_callback'
            );

           Associates an event handle with an asynchronous callback. A callback will be passed a hashref as  its
           argument, this hashref contains pair(s) of posted event's name and its corresponding count.

           It is safe to call "ib_register_callback" multiple times for the same event handle. In this case, the
           previously registered callback will be automatically cancelled.

           If  the  callback returns FALSE, the registered callback will be no longer invoked, but internally it
           is  still  there  until  the  event  handle  goes  out  of  scope  (or   undef-ed),   or   you   call
           "ib_cancel_callback" to actually disassociate it from the event handle.

       "ib_cancel_callback"
            $dbh-&gt;func($evh, 'ib_cancel_callback');

           Unregister a callback from an event handle. This function has a limitation, however, that it can't be
           called  from  inside  a  callback.  In  many cases, you won't need this function, since when an event
           handle goes out of scope, its associated callback(s) will be automatically  cancelled  before  it  is
           cleaned up.

</pre><h4><b>RETRIEVING</b> <b>FIREBIRD</b> <b>/</b> <b>INTERBASE</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       "ib_tx_info"
            $hash_ref = $dbh-&gt;func('ib_tx_info');

           Retrieve information about current active transaction.

       "ib_database_info"
            $hash_ref = $dbh-&gt;func(@info, 'ib_database_info');
            $hash_ref = $dbh-&gt;func([@info], 'ib_database_info');

           Retrieve database information from current connection.

       "ib_plan"
            $plan = $sth-&gt;func('ib_plan');

           Retrieve query plan from a prepared SQL statement.

            my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM foo');
            print $sth-&gt;func('ib_plan'); # PLAN (FOO NATURAL)

       "ib_drop_database"
            $result = $dbh-&gt;func('ib_drop_database');

           Drops  the  database,  associated  with  the connection. The database handle is no longer valid after
           calling this function.

           Caution is advised as the drop is irrevocable.

</pre><h4><b>UNSUPPORTED</b> <b>SQL</b> <b>STATEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a list of SQL statements which can't be used. But this shouldn't  be  a  problem,  because  their
       functionality are already provided by the DBI methods.

       •   SET TRANSACTION

           Use "$dbh-"func(..., 'set_tx_param')&gt; instead.

       •   DESCRIBE

           Provides information about columns that are retrieved by a DSQL statement, or about placeholders in a
           statement. This functionality is supported by the driver, and transparent for users. Column names are
           available via $sth-&gt;{NAME} attributes.

       •   EXECUTE IMMEDIATE

           Calling <b>do()</b> method without bind value(s) will do the same.

       •   CLOSE, OPEN, DECLARE CURSOR

           $sth-&gt;{CursorName}  is  automagically  available upon executing a "SELECT .. FOR UPDATE" statement. A
           cursor is closed after the last <b>fetch()</b>, or by calling $sth-&gt;<b>finish()</b>.

       •   PREPARE, EXECUTE, FETCH

           Similar functionalities are obtained by using <b>prepare()</b>, <b>execute()</b>, and <b>fetch()</b> methods.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>DBIx::*</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       "DBD::Firebird" is known to work with "DBIx::Recordset"  0.21,  and  "Apache::DBI"  0.87.  Yuri  Vasiliev
       &lt;<u><a href="mailto:yuri.vasiliev@targuscom.com">yuri.vasiliev@targuscom.com</a></u>&gt;  reported successful usage with Apache::AuthDBI (part of "Apache::DBI" 0.87
       distribution).

       The driver is untested with  "Apache::Session::DBI".  Doesn't  work  with  "Tie::DBI".  "Tie::DBI"  calls
       $dbh-&gt;prepare("LISTFIELDS $table_name") on which Firebird fails to parse. I think that the call should be
       made within an eval block.

</pre><h4><b>SERVICE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>DBD::Firebird-&gt;create_database(</b> <b>{</b> <b>params...</b> <b>}</b> <b>)</b>
       A class method for creating empty databases.

       The method croaks on error. Params may be:

       db_path (string, required)
           Path to database, including host name if necessary.

           Examples:

           server:/path/to/db.fdb
           /srv/db/base.fdb
       user (string, optional)
           User name to be used for the request.

       password (string, optional)
           Password to be used for the request.

       page_size (integer, optional)
           Page  size  of  the newly created database. Should be something supported by the server. Firebird 2.5
           supports the following page sizes: 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192 and 16384 and defaults to 4096.

       character_set (string, optional)
           The default character set of the database. Firebird 2.5 defaults to "NONE".

       dialect (integer, optional)
           The dialect of the database. Defaults to 3.

       After creation, the new database can be used after connecting to it with the usual DBI-&gt;connect(...)

   <b>DBD::Firebird-&gt;gfix(</b> <b>{</b> <b>params</b> <b>}</b> <b>)</b>
       A class method for simulating a subset of the functionality of the Firebird's <b><a href="../man1/gfix.1.html">gfix</a></b>(1) utility.

       Params is a hash reference, with the following keys:

       db_path (string, required)
           The path to the database to connect to. Should include host name if necessary.

       user (string, optional)
           User name to connect as. Must be SYSDBA or database owner.

       password (string, optional)
           Password to be used for the connection.

           Note that user and password are not needed for embedded connections.

       forced_writes (boolean, optional)
           If given, sets the forced writes flag of the database, causing Firebird  to  use  synchronous  writes
           when working with that database.

       buffers (integer, optional)
           If  given,  sets  the  default number of buffers for the database. Can be overridden on connect time.
           Note that buffers are measured in database pages, not bytes.

</pre><h4><b>FAQ</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>operations</b> <b>performing</b> <b>positioned</b> <b>update</b> <b>and</b> <b>delete</b> <b>fail</b> <b>when</b> <b>AutoCommit</b> <b>is</b> <b>on?</b>
       For example, the following code snippet fails:

        $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(
        "SELECT * FROM ORDERS WHERE user_id &lt; 5 FOR UPDATE OF comment");
        $sth-&gt;execute;
        while (@res = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_array) {
            $dbh-&gt;do("UPDATE ORDERS SET comment = 'Wonderful' WHERE
            CURRENT OF $sth-&gt;{CursorName}");
        }

       When <b>AutoCommit</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b>, a transaction is started within <b>prepare()</b>, and committed automatically  after  the
       last  <b>fetch()</b>,  or  within  <b>finish()</b>. Within <b>do()</b>, a transaction is started right before the statement is
       executed, and gets committed right after the statement is executed.  The  transaction  handle  is  stored
       within  the database handle. The driver is smart enough not to override an active transaction handle with
       a new one. So, if you notice the snippet above, after the first <b>fetchrow_array()</b>, the <b>do()</b> is still using
       the same transaction context, but as soon as it has finished executing  the  statement,  it  <b>commits</b>  the
       transaction, whereas the next <b>fetchrow_array()</b> still needs the transaction context!

       So the secret to make this work is <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>transaction</b> <b>open</b>. This can be done in two ways:

       •   Using AutoCommit = 0

           If yours is default to AutoCommit on, you can put the snippet within a block:

            {
                $dbh-&gt;{AutoCommit} = 0;
                # same actions like above ....
                $dbh-&gt;commit;
            }

       •   Using $dbh-&gt;{ib_softcommit} = 1

           This is a driver-specific attribute,You may want to look at t/70-nested-sth.t to see it in action.

   <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>nested</b> <b>statement</b> <b>handles</b> <b>break</b> <b>under</b> <b>AutoCommit</b> <b>mode?</b>
       The same explanation as above applies. The workaround is also much alike:

        {
            $dbh-&gt;{AutoCommit} = 0;
            $sth1 = $dbh-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM $table");
            $sth2 = $dbh-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM $table WHERE id = ?");
            $sth1-&gt;execute;

            while ($row = $sth1-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref) {
               $sth2-&gt;execute($row-&gt;[0]);
               $res = $sth2-&gt;fetchall_arrayref;
            }
            $dbh-&gt;commit;
        }

       You may also use $dbh-&gt;{ib_softcommit}  please check t/70nested-sth.t for an example on how to use it.

   <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>placeholders</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>bind,</b> <b>generating</b> <b>unknown</b> <b>datatype</b> <b>error</b> <b>message?</b>
       You can't bind a field name. The following example will fail:

        $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("SELECT (?) FROM $table");
        $sth-&gt;execute('user_id');

       There are cases where placeholders can't be used in conjunction with COLLATE clause, such as this:

        SELECT * FROM $table WHERE UPPER(author) LIKE UPPER(? COLLATE FR_CA);

       This  deals  with  the  Firebird's  SQL  parser,  not  with  "DBD::Firebird".  The driver just passes SQL
       statements through the engine.

   <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>increment</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> <b>field?</b>
       Create a sequence and a trigger to associate it with the field. The following example creates a  sequence
       named  PROD_ID_SEQ,  and a trigger for table ORDERS which uses the generator to perform auto increment on
       field PRODUCE_ID with increment size of 1.

        $dbh-&gt;do("create sequence PROD_ID_SEQ");
        $dbh-&gt;do(
        "CREATE TRIGGER INC_PROD_ID FOR ORDERS
        BEFORE INSERT POSITION 0
        AS BEGIN
          NEW.PRODUCE_ID = NEXT VALUE FOR PROD_ID_SEQ;
        END");

       From Firebird 3.0 there is Identity support

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>perform</b> <b>LIMIT</b> <b>clause</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>MySQL?</b>
       "LIMIT" clause let users to fetch only a portion rather than the whole records as the result of a  query.
       This  is particularly efficient and useful for paging feature on web pages, where users can navigate back
       and forth between pages.

       Using Firebird 2.5.x this can be implemented by using "ROWS" .

        <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/refdocs/langrefupd21-select.html">http://www.firebirdsql.org/refdocs/langrefupd21-select.html</a>#langrefupd21-select-rows

       For example, to display a portion of table employee within your application:

        # fetch record 1 - 5:
        $res = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref("SELECT * FROM employee rows 1 to 5)");

        # fetch record 6 - 10:
        $res = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref("SELECT * FROM employee rows 6 to 10)");

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>date/time</b> <b>formatting</b> <b>attributes?</b>
       Those attributes take the same format as the C function <b>strftime()</b>'s.  Examples:

        $attr = {
           ib_timestampformat =&gt; '%m-%d-%Y %H:%M',
           ib_dateformat =&gt; '%m-%d-%Y',
           ib_timeformat =&gt; '%H:%M',
        };

       Then, pass it to <b>prepare()</b> method.

        $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($stmt, $attr);
        # followed by execute() and fetch(), or:

        $res = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref($stmt, $attr);

   <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>date/time</b> <b>formatting</b> <b>attributes</b> <b>between</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>and</b> <b>fetch?</b>
       No. "ib_dateformat", "ib_timeformat", and "ib_timestampformat" can only be set during  $sth-&gt;prepare.  If
       this is a problem to you, let me know, and probably I'll add this capability for the next release.

   <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>change</b> <b>ib_dialect</b> <b>after</b> <b>DBI-&gt;connect</b> <b>?</b>
       No. If this is a problem to you, let me know, and probably I'll add this capability for the next release.

           This module is originally based on the work of Bill Karwin's IBPerl.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS/LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Please          report          bugs          and           feature           suggestions           using

       This  module  doesn't  work  with MSWin32 ActivePerl iThreads, and its emulated fork. Tested with MSWin32
       ActivePerl build 809 (Perl 5.8.3). The whole process will block in unpredictable manner.

       Under Linux, this module has been tested with several different iThreads enabled Perl releases.

       No problem occurred so far.. until you try to share a DBI handle ;-)

       But if you plan to use thread, you'd better use the latest stable version of Perl

       On FreeBSD you need a Perl compiled with thread support.

       Limitations:

       •   Arrays are not (yet) supported

       •   Read/Write BLOB fields block by block not (yet) supported. The maximum size of a BLOB  read/write  is
           hardcoded to about 1 MB.

       •   service manager API is not supported.
