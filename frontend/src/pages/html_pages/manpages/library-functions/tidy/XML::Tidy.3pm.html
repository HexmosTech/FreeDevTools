</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XML::Tidy - tidy indenting of XML documents

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This documentation refers to version 1.20 of XML::Tidy, which was released on Sun Jul  9 09:43:30:08
       -0500 2017.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>
         use strict;use  warnings;
         use   utf8;use XML::Tidy;

         # create new   XML::Tidy object by loading:  MainFile.xml
         my $tidy_obj = XML::Tidy-&gt;new('filename' =&gt; 'MainFile.xml');

         #   tidy  up  the  indenting
            $tidy_obj-&gt;tidy();

         #             write out changes back     to  MainFile.xml
            $tidy_obj-&gt;write();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module creates XML document objects (with inheritance from XML::XPath) to tidy mixed-content (i.e.,
       non-data) text node indenting. There are also some other handy member functions to compress and expand
       your XML document object (into either a compact XML representation or a binary one).

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new()</b>
       This is the standard Tidy object constructor. Except for the added 'binary' option, it can take the same
       parameters as an XML::XPath object constructor to initialize the XML document object. These can be any
       one of:

         'filename' =&gt; 'SomeFile.xml'
         'binary'   =&gt; 'SomeBinaryFile.xtb'
         'xml'      =&gt; $variable_which_holds_a_bunch_of_XML_data
         'ioref'    =&gt; $file_InputOutput_reference
         'context'  =&gt; $existing_node_at_specified_context_to_become_new_obj

   <b>reload()</b>
       The <b>reload()</b> member function causes the latest data contained in a Tidy object to be re-parsed (which re-
       indexes all nodes).

       This can be necessary after modifications have been made to nodes which impact the tree node hierarchy
       because XML::XPath's <b>find()</b> member preserves state information which can get out-of-sync.

       <b>reload()</b> is probably rarely useful by itself but it is needed by <b>strip()</b> and <b>prune()</b> so it is exposed as
       a method in case it comes in handy for other uses.

   <b>strip()</b>
       The <b>strip()</b> member function searches the Tidy object for all mixed-content (i.e., non-data) text nodes
       and empties them out.  This will basically unformat any markup indenting.

       <b>strip()</b> is used by <b>compress()</b> and <b>tidy()</b> but it is exposed because it is also worthwhile by itself.

   <b>tidy()</b>
       The <b>tidy()</b> member function can take a single optional parameter as the string that should be inserted for
       each indent level. Some examples:

         # Tidy up indenting with default two  (2) spaces per indent level
            $tidy_obj-&gt;tidy();

         # Tidy up indenting with         four (4) spaces per indent level
            $tidy_obj-&gt;tidy('    ');

         # Tidy up indenting with         one  (1) tab    per indent level
            $tidy_obj-&gt;tidy('tab' );

         # Tidy up indenting with         two  (2) tabs   per indent level
            $tidy_obj-&gt;tidy("\t\t");

       The default behavior is to use two (2) spaces for each indent level. The Tidy object gets all mixed-
       content (i.e., non-data) text nodes reformatted to appropriate indent levels according to tree nesting
       depth.

       NOTE: <b>tidy()</b> disturbs some XML escapes in whatever ways XML::XPath does. It has been brought to my
       attention that these modules also strip CDATA tags from XML files / data they operate on. Even though
       CDATA tags don't seem very common, I would very much like for them to work smoothly too. Hopefully the
       vast majority of files will work fine and future support for any of the more rare types can be added
       later.

       Additionally, please take notice that every call to <b>tidy()</b> (as well as reload, strip, and most other
       XML::Tidy functions) leak some memory due to their usage of XPath's findnodes command. This issue was
       described helpfully at &lt;HTTPS://RT.CPAN.Org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120296&gt;.  Thanks to Jozef!

   <b>compress()</b>
       The <b>compress()</b> member function calls <b>strip()</b> on the Tidy object then creates an encoded comment which
       contains the names of elements and attributes as they occurred in the original document. Their respective
       element and attribute names are replaced with just the appropriate index throughout the document.

       <b>compress()</b> can accept a parameter describing which node types to attempt to shrink down as abbreviations.
       This parameter should be a string of just the first letters of each node type you wish to include as in
       the following mapping:

         e = elements
         a = attribute   keys
         v = attribute values *EXPERIMENTAL*
         t = text       nodes *EXPERIMENTAL*
         c = comment    nodes *EXPERIMENTAL*
         n = namespace  nodes *not-yet-implemented*

       Attribute values ('v') and text nodes ('t') both seem to work fine with current tokenization. I've still
       labeled them EXPERIMENTAL because they seem more likely to cause problems than valid element or attribute
       key names. I have some bugs in the comment node compression which I haven't been able to find yet so that
       one should be avoided for now. Since these three node types ('vtc') all require tokenization, they are
       not included in default compression ('ea'). An example call which includes values and text would be:

         $tidy_obj-&gt;compress('eavt');

       The original document structure (i.e., node hierarchy) is preserved.  <b>compress()</b> significantly reduces
       the file size of most XML documents for when size matters more than immediate human readability.
       <b>expand()</b> performs the opposite conversion.

   <b>expand()</b>
       The <b>expand()</b> member function reads any XML::Tidy::compress comments from the Tidy object and uses them to
       reconstruct the document that was passed to <b>compress()</b>.

   <b>bcompress('BinaryOutputFilename.xtb')</b>
       The <b>bcompress()</b> member function stores a binary representation of any Tidy object. The format consists
       of:

         0) a null-terminated version string
         1) a byte specifying how many bytes later indices will be
         2) the number of bytes from 1 above to designate the total string  count
         3) the number of null-terminated          strings from 2 above
         4) the number of bytes from 1 above to designate the total integer count
         5) the number of 4-byte                  integers from 4 above
         6) the number of bytes from 1 above to designate the total float   count
         7) the number of 8-byte (double-precision) floats from 6 above
         8) node index sets until the end of the file

       Normal node index sets consist of two values. The first is an index (again the number of bytes long comes
       from 1) into the three lists as if they were all linear. The second is a single-byte integer identifying
       the node type (using standard DOM node type enumerations).

       A few special cases exist in node index sets though. If the index is null, it is interpreted as a close-
       element tag (so no accompanying type value is read). On the other end, when the index is non-zero, the
       type value is always read. In the event that the type corresponds to an attribute or a processing
       instruction, the next index is read (without another accompanying type value) in order to complete the
       data fields required by those node types.

       NOTE: Please bear in mind that the encoding of binary integers and floats only works properly if the
       values are not surrounded by spaces or other delimiters and each is contained in its own single node.
       This is necessary to enable thorough reconstruction of whitespace from the original document. I recommend
       storing every numerical value as an isolated attribute value or text node without any surrounding
       whitespace.

         # Examples which encode all numbers as binary:
         &lt;friend name="goodguy" category="15"&gt;
           &lt;hitpoints&gt;31.255&lt;/hitpoints&gt;
           &lt;location&gt;
             &lt;x&gt;-15.65535&lt;/x&gt;
             &lt;y&gt;16383.7&lt;/y&gt;
             &lt;z&gt;-1023.63&lt;/z&gt;
           &lt;/location&gt;
         &lt;/friend&gt;

         # Examples which encode all numbers as strings:
         &lt;enemy name="badguy" category=" 666 "&gt;
           &lt;hitpoints&gt; 2.0 &lt;/hitpoints&gt;
           &lt;location&gt; 4.0 -2.0 4.0 &lt;/location&gt;
         &lt;/enemy&gt;

       The default file extension is .xtb (for XML::Tidy Binary).

   <b>bexpand('BinaryInputFilename.xtb')</b>
       The <b>bexpand()</b> member function reads a binary file which was previously written from <b>bcompress()</b>.
       <b>bexpand()</b> is an XML::Tidy object constructor like <b>new()</b> so it can be called like:

         my $xtbo = XML::Tidy-&gt;bexpand('BinaryInputFilename.xtb');

   <b>prune()</b>
       The <b>prune()</b> member function takes an XPath location to remove (along with all attributes and child nodes)
       from the Tidy object. For example, to remove all comments:

         $tidy_obj-&gt;prune('//comment()');

       or to remove the third baz (XPath indexing is 1-based):

         $tidy_obj-&gt;prune('/foo/bar/baz[3]');

       Pruning your XML tree is a form of tidying too so it snuck in here. =)

   <b>write()</b>
       The <b>write()</b> member function can take an optional filename parameter to write out any changes to the Tidy
       object. If no parameters are given, <b>write()</b> overwrites the original XML document file (if a 'filename'
       parameter was given to the constructor).

       <b>write()</b> will <b>croak()</b> if no filename can be found to write to.

       <b>write()</b> can also take a secondary parameter which specifies an XPath location to be written out as the
       new root element instead of the Tidy object's root. Only the first matching element is written.

   <b>toString()</b>
       The <b>toString()</b> member function is almost identical to <b>write()</b> except that it takes no parameters and
       simply returns the equivalent XML string as a scalar. It is a little weird because normally only
       XML::XPath::Node objects have a <b>toString()</b> member but I figure it makes sense to extend the same syntax
       to the parent object as well, since it is a useful option.

</pre><h4><b>createNode</b> <b>Wrappers</b></h4><pre>
       The following are just aliases to Node constructors. They'll work with just the unique portion of the
       node type as the member function name.

   <b>e()</b> <b>or</b> <b>el()</b> <b>or</b> <b>elem()</b> <b>or</b> <b>createElement()</b>
       wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::Element-&gt;<b>new()</b>

   <b>a()</b> <b>or</b> <b>at()</b> <b>or</b> <b>attr()</b> <b>or</b> <b>createAttribute()</b>
       wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::Attribute-&gt;<b>new()</b>

   <b>c()</b> <b>or</b> <b>cm()</b> <b>or</b> <b>cmnt()</b> <b>or</b> <b>createComment()</b>
       wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::Comment-&gt;<b>new()</b>

   <b>t()</b> <b>or</b> <b>tx()</b> <b>or</b> <b>text()</b> <b>or</b> <b>createTextNode()</b>
       wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::Text-&gt;<b>new()</b>

   <b>p()</b> <b>or</b> <b>pi()</b> <b>or</b> <b>proc()</b> <b>or</b> <b>createProcessingInstruction()</b>
       wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::PI-&gt;<b>new()</b>

   <b>n()</b> <b>or</b> <b>ns()</b> <b>or</b> <b>nspc()</b> <b>or</b> <b>createNamespace()</b>
       wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::Namespace-&gt;<b>new()</b>

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTED</b> <b>CONSTANTS</b></h4><pre>
       Since they are sometimes needed to compare against, XML::Tidy also exports the same node constants as
       XML::XPath::Node (which correspond to DOM values). These include:

   <b>UNKNOWN_NODE</b>
   <b>ELEMENT_NODE</b>
   <b>ATTRIBUTE_NODE</b>
   <b>TEXT_NODE</b>
   <b>CDATA_SECTION_NODE</b>
   <b>ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE</b>
   <b>ENTITY_NODE</b>
   <b>PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE</b>
   <b>COMMENT_NODE</b>
   <b>DOCUMENT_NODE</b>
   <b>DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE</b>
   <b>DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE</b>
   <b>NOTATION_NODE</b>
   <b>ELEMENT_DECL_NODE</b>
   <b>ATT_DEF_NODE</b>
   <b>XML_DECL_NODE</b>
   <b>ATTLIST_DECL_NODE</b>
   <b>NAMESPACE_NODE</b>
       XML::Tidy also exports:

   <b>STANDARD_XML_DECL</b>
       which returns a reasonable default XML declaration string (assuming typical "utf-8" encoding).

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       - fix <b>reload()</b> from messing up Unicode escaped &amp;XYZ; components like Copyright &amp;#xA9; and Registered
       &amp;#xAE; (probably needs pre and post processing)
       - write many better UTF-8 tests
       - support namespaces
       - handle CDATA
