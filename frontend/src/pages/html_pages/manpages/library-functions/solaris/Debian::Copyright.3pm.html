</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Debian::Copyright - manage Debian copyright files

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Debian::Copyright version 0.2 .

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $c = Debian::Copyright-&gt;new();       # construct a new
           $c-&gt;read($file1);                       # parse debian copyright file
           $c-&gt;read($file2);                       # parse a second
           $c-&gt;write($ofile);                      # write to file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Debian::Copyright can be used for the representation, manipulation and merging of Debian copyright files
       in an object-oriented way. It provides easy reading and writing of the <u>debian/copyright</u> file found in
       Debian source packages. Debian has recently started standardising its copyright files around the machine-
       readable "Format: <a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/">http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/</a>" in DEP-5 format.

   <b>note</b> <b>on</b> <b>terminology</b>
       The term "Stanza" derives from the dh-make-perl &lt;<a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/dh-make-perl">http://packages.debian.org/sid/dh-make-perl</a>&gt; tool. The
       official term would now be "Paragraph". For the purposes of discussing the DEP-5 format the terms are
       used interchangeably in this documentation.

</pre><h4><b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>header</b>
       An instance of Debian::Copyright::Stanza::Header class. Contains the the first stanza of the copyright
       file. If multiple files were parsed only the first will be retained.

   <b>files</b>
       A hash reference (actually Tie::IxHash instance) with keys being the values of the "Files" clause and
       values instances of Debian::Copyright::Stanza::Files class.

   <b>licenses</b>
       A hash reference (actually Tie::IxHash instance) with keys being the values of the "License" clause and
       values instances of Debian::Copyright::Stanza::License class.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       Constructs a new Debian::Copyright instance.

       The "header" field is initialised with an empty string.  The "files_block" and "license_block" fields are
       initialised with an empty instance of Tie::IxHash.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>read</b> <u><b>file</b></u>
       Parse "copyright" in debian and accessors.

       <u>file</u> can be either a file name, an opened file handle or a string scalar reference.

   <b>write</b> <u><b>file</b></u>
       Writes a debian/copyright-like file in <u>file</u> with the contents defined in the accessor fields.

       <u>file</u> can be either a file name, an opened file handle or a string scalar reference.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This module is written with one particular version of DEP-5 &lt;<a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging">http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging</a>-
       manuals/copyright-format/1.0/&gt; in mind. Furthermore version 0.1 of this software was for a draft version
       the standard. The changes in going from draft to standard were such that it was not worth attempting to
       maintain backwards compatibility.
       Test coverage is not yet complete.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       This version is not backwards compatible with version 0.1.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
