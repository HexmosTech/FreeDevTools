</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements an interface to the Linux 2.6.13 and later Inotify file/directory change
       notification system.

       It has a number of advantages over the Linux::Inotify module:

          - it is portable (Linux::Inotify only works on x86)
          - the equivalent of fullname works correctly
          - it is better documented
          - it has callback-style interface, which is better suited for
            integration.

       As for the inotify API itself - it is a very tricky, and somewhat unreliable API. For a good overview of
       the challenges you might run into, see this LWN article: &lt;https://lwn.net/Articles/605128/&gt;.

   <b>The</b> <b>Linux::Inotify2</b> <b>Class</b>
       my $inotify = new Linux::Inotify2
           Create  a new notify object and return it. A notify object is kind of a container that stores watches
           on file system names and is responsible for handling event data.

           On error, "undef" is returned and $! will be set accordingly. The following errors are documented:

            ENFILE   The system limit on the total number of file descriptors has been reached.
            EMFILE   The user limit on the total number of inotify instances has been reached.
            ENOMEM   Insufficient kernel memory is available.

           Example:

              my $inotify = new Linux::Inotify2
                 or die "Unable to create new inotify object: $!";

       $watch = $inotify-&gt;watch ($name, $mask[, $cb])
           Add a new watcher to the given notifier. The watcher will create events  on  the  pathname  $name  as
           given  in $mask, which can be any of the following constants (all exported by default) ORed together.
           Constants unavailable on your system will evaluate to 0.

           "file" refers to any file system object in the watched object (always a directory),  that  is  files,
           directories,  symlinks,  device  nodes etc., while "object" refers to the object the watcher has been
           set on itself:

            IN_ACCESS            object was accessed
            IN_MODIFY            object was modified
            IN_ATTRIB            object metadata changed
            IN_CLOSE_WRITE       writable fd to file / to object was closed
            IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE     readonly fd to file / to object closed
            IN_OPEN              object was opened
            IN_MOVED_FROM        file was moved from this object (directory)
            IN_MOVED_TO          file was moved to this object (directory)
            IN_CREATE            file was created in this object (directory)
            IN_DELETE            file was deleted from this object (directory)
            IN_DELETE_SELF       object itself was deleted
            IN_MOVE_SELF         object itself was moved
            IN_ALL_EVENTS        all of the above events

            IN_ONESHOT           only send event once
            IN_ONLYDIR           only watch the path if it is a directory
            IN_DONT_FOLLOW       don't follow a sym link (Linux 2.6.15+)
            IN_EXCL_UNLINK       don't create events for unlinked objects (Linux 2.6.36+)
            IN_MASK_ADD          not supported with the current version of this module

            IN_CLOSE             same as IN_CLOSE_WRITE | IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE
            IN_MOVE              same as IN_MOVED_FROM | IN_MOVED_TO

           $cb  is  a  perl  code  reference  that,  if  given,  is  called  for  each  event.  It  receives   a
           "Linux::Inotify2::Event" object.

           The returned $watch object is of class "Linux::Inotify2::Watch".

           On error, "undef" is returned and $! will be set accordingly. The following errors are documented:

            EBADF    The given file descriptor is not valid.
            EINVAL   The given event mask contains no legal events.
            ENOMEM   Insufficient kernel memory was available.
            ENOSPC   The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached or the kernel failed to allocate a needed resource.
            EACCESS  Read access to the given file is not permitted.

           Example, show when "<a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>" gets accessed and/or modified once:

              $inotify-&gt;watch ("<a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>", IN_ACCESS | IN_MODIFY, sub {
                 my $e = shift;
                 print "$e-&gt;{w}{name} was accessed\n" if $e-&gt;IN_ACCESS;
                 print "$e-&gt;{w}{name} was modified\n" if $e-&gt;IN_MODIFY;
                 print "$e-&gt;{w}{name} is no longer mounted\n" if $e-&gt;IN_UNMOUNT;
                 print "events for $e-&gt;{w}{name} have been lost\n" if $e-&gt;IN_Q_OVERFLOW;

                 $e-&gt;w-&gt;cancel;
              });

       $inotify-&gt;fileno
           Returns  the  file  descriptor for this notify object. When in non-blocking mode, you are responsible
           for calling the "poll" method when this file descriptor becomes ready for reading.

       $inotify-&gt;fh
           Similar to "fileno", but returns a perl file handle instead.

       $inotify-&gt;blocking ($blocking)
           Clears ($blocking true) or sets ($blocking false) the "O_NONBLOCK" flag on the file descriptor.

       $count = $inotify-&gt;poll
           Reads events from the kernel and handles them.  If  the  notify  file  descriptor  is  blocking  (the
           default),  then  this  method  waits for at least one event. Otherwise it returns immediately when no
           pending events could be read.

           Returns the count of events that have been handled (which can be 0 in case events have been  received
           but have been ignored or handled internally).

           Croaks when an error occurs.

       @events = $inotify-&gt;read
           Reads events from the kernel. Blocks when the file descriptor is in blocking mode (default) until any
           event  arrives.  Returns list of "Linux::Inotify2::Event" objects or empty list if none (non-blocking
           mode or events got ignored).

           Croaks on error.

           Normally you shouldn't use this function, but instead use watcher callbacks and call "-&gt;poll".

       $inotify-&gt;on_overflow ($cb-&gt;($ev))
           Sets the callback to be used for overflow handling (default: "undef"): When "read" receives an  event
           with "IN_Q_OVERFLOW" set, it will invoke this callback with the event.

           When  the callback is "undef", then it broadcasts the event to all registered watchers, i.e., "undef"
           is equivalent to:

              sub { $inotify-&gt;broadcast ($_[0]) }

       $inotify-&gt;broadcast ($ev)
           Invokes all registered watcher callbacks and passes the given event to them. Most useful in  overflow
           handlers.

   <b>The</b> <b>Linux::Inotify2::Event</b> <b>Class</b>
       Objects  of this class are handed as first argument to the watcher callback. It has the following members
       and methods:

       $event-&gt;w
       $event-&gt;{w}
           The watcher object for this event, if one is available. Generally, you cna only rely on the value  of
           this member inside watcher callbacks.

       $event-&gt;name
       $event-&gt;{name}
           The path of the file system object, relative to the watched name.

       $event-&gt;fullname
           Returns  the  "full" name of the relevant object, i.e. including the "name" member of the watcher (if
           the watch object is on a directory and a directory entry is affected), or simply  the  "name"  member
           itself when the object is the watch object itself.

           This  call  requires  "$event-&gt;{w}"  to  be  valid,  which  is generally only the case within watcher
           callbacks.

       $event-&gt;mask
       $event-&gt;{mask}
           The received event mask. In addition to the events described  for  "$inotify-&gt;watch",  the  following
           flags (exported by default) can be set:

            IN_ISDIR             event object is a directory
            IN_Q_OVERFLOW        event queue overflowed

            # when any of the following flags are set,
            # then watchers for this event are automatically canceled
            IN_UNMOUNT           filesystem for watched object was unmounted
            IN_IGNORED           file was ignored/is gone (no more events are delivered)
            IN_ONESHOT           only one event was generated
            IN_Q_OVERFLOW        queue overflow - event might not be specific to a watcher

       $event-&gt;IN_xxx
           Returns  a boolean that returns true if the event mask contains any events specified by the mask. All
           of the "IN_xxx" constants can be used as methods.

       $event-&gt;cookie
       $event-&gt;{cookie}
           The event cookie to "synchronize two events". Normally zero,  this  value  is  set  when  two  events
           relating  to the same file are generated. As far as I know, this only happens for "IN_MOVED_FROM" and
           "IN_MOVED_TO" events, to identify the old and new name of a file.

           Note that the inotify API makes it impossible to know whether there will be a "IN_MOVED_TO"  event  -
           you  might receive only one of the events, and even if you receive both, there might be any number of
           events in between. The best approach seems to be to implement a small timeout  after  "IN_MOVED_FROM"
           to see if a matching "IN_MOVED_TO" event will be received - 2ms seem to work relatively well.

   <b>The</b> <b>Linux::Inotify2::Watch</b> <b>Class</b>
       Watcher objects are created by calling the "watch" method of a notifier.

       It has the following members and methods:

       $watch-&gt;name
       $watch-&gt;{name}
           The  name  as  specified  in  the "watch" call. For the object itself, this is the empty string.  For
           directory watches, this is the name of the entry without leading path elements.

       $watch-&gt;mask
       $watch-&gt;{mask}
           The mask as specified in the "watch" call.

       $watch-&gt;cb ([new callback])
       $watch-&gt;{cb}
           The callback as specified in the "watch" call. Can optionally be changed.

       $watch-&gt;cancel
           Cancels/removes this watcher. Future events, even if already queued queued, will not be  handled  and
           resources will be freed.
