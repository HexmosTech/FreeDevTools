</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Debian::Control::Stanza::Binary - binary stanza of Debian source package control file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $bin = Debian::Control::Stanza::Binary-&gt;new(\%data);
           print $bin;                         # auto-stringification
           print $bin-&gt;Depends;                # Debian::Dependencies object

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Debian::Control::Stanza::Binary can be used for representation and manipulation of "Package:" stanza of
       Debian source package control files in an object-oriented way. Converts itself to a textual
       representation in string context.

</pre><h4><b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       The supported fields for binary stanzas are listed below. For more information about each field's
       meaning, consult the section named "Source package control files -- debian/control" of the Debian Policy
       Manual at &lt;https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/&gt;

       Note that real control fields may contain dashes in their names. These are replaced with underscores.

       Package
       Architecture
       Section
       Priority
       Essential
       Depends
       Recommends
       Suggests
       Enhances
       Replaces
       Pre_Depends
       Conflicts
       Breaks
       Provides
       Built_Using
       Multi_Arch
       Description
       Package_Type
       Build_Profiles

       "Depends",  "Conflicts"  "Breaks",  "Recommends",  "Suggests",  "Enhances", "Replaces", and "Pre_Depends"
       fields are converted to objects of Debian::Dependencies class upon construction.

       Two more accessor methods are provided for easier handling of package's short and long description.

       short_description
       long_description

       Setting them transparently modifies <u>Description</u>. Note that the value of <u>long_description</u> is  "unmangled",
       that  is  without  leading spaces, and empty lines are empty. <u>Description</u> on the other hand is just as it
       looks in a regular debian/control file - the long part is indented with a single space  and  empty  lines
       are replaced with dots.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       new
       new( { field =&gt; value, ... } )
           Creates  a new Debian::Control::Stanza::Binary object and optionally initializes it with the supplied
           data.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Debian::Control::Stanza::Source inherits most of its functionality from Debian::Control::Stanza
