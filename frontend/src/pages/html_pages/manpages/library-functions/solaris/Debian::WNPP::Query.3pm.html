</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Debian::WNPP::Query - offline storage of Debian's work-needing package lists

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $wnpp = Debian::WNPP::Query-&gt;new(
               {   cache_dir       =&gt; '/somewhere',
                   network_enabled =&gt; 0,
                   ttl             =&gt; 3600 * 24,
                   bug_types       =&gt; [qw( ITP RFP )]
               }
           );

           my @bugs = $wnpp-&gt;bugs_for_package('ken-lee');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Debian::WNPP::Query provides a way to retrieve and cache the contents of Debian's "Work-needing and
       prospective packages" lists.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       <b>new</b> is the constructor. Initial field values are to be given as a hash reference.

       If <b>cache_file</b> is given, it is read.

</pre><h4><b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       cache_file <u>path</u>
           The  path to the file holding the offline cache of the WNPP lists. If not specified, no cache is read
           or written.

       ttl <u>seconds</u>
           The time after which the on-disk cache is considered too old and WNPP  pages  are  retrieved  afresh.
           Ignored if <b>cache_file</b> is not defined. Defaults to 86400 (1 day).

       bug_types <u>arrayref</u>
           Specified  which bug types to retrieve. For example, if you are interested in ITP and RFP bugs, there
           is no point in downloading, parsing and storing ITA/RFA/O bugs. By default  all  types  of  bugs  are
           processed.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       bugs_for_package(<u>package</u>)
           Returns a list of bugs matching the given package name. Normally the list would contain only one bug,
           but there are no guarantees.
