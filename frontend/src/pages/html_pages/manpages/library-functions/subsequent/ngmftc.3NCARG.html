</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       NGMFTC - Temporarily closes a metafile output unit allowing for subsequent reopening.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL NGMFTC(WKID)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_ngmftc(int wkid)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       WKID        (an  input  variable of type INTEGER) that specifies the GKS workstation ID to be temporarily
                   closed.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Use NGMFTC to close a metafile temporarily for reopening with NGREOP.  The temporary close can be done at
       any time after a metafile workstation has been opened, even in the middle  of  drawing  a  picture.   The
       primary use of NGMFTC is to allow for writing to more than one metafile in a single job execution.  Since
       NCAR GKS does not allow for having more than a single NCGM workstation open at a time, you can use NGMFTC
       to  stop output to one metafile while you write to another metafile and then resume output to the initial
       metafile.

       If you simply want to suspend output to a metafile workstation, but do  not  need  to  write  to  another
       metafile  workstation,  simply  use  the  GKS  entry  GDAWK  to  deactivate  the workstation and GOPWK to
       reactivate it when you want to resume output.

       For saving the state of all primitive attribute values  of  an  NCGM  workstation  at  the  time  of  the
       temporary  close  and  restoring  them  at  the  time of the reopen with NGREOP, see the documenation for
       NGSRAT.

       If NGMFTC is used and NGREOP is not subsequently invoked to reopen the file so that it can be  terminated
       normally  in  the  same  job  step, then an improperly terminated metafile will result from the temporary
       close.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Assuming that an NCGM workstation, with workstation identifier 1, is open, then

               CALL <a href="../man1/NGMFTC.1.html">NGMFTC</a>(1)

       would temporarily close the workstation.

       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant example: pgkex27.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use NGMFTC or c_ngmftc, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably  in
       that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       The argument to NGMFTC must be an NCGM workstation that is open but not active.
