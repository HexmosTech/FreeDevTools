       String::License::Naming - names of licenses and license naming schemes

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version v0.0.11

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use String::License::Naming::Custom;

           my $obj = String::License::Naming::Custom-&gt;new( schemes =&gt; [qw(spdx internal)] );

           my $schemes = [ $obj-&gt;list_schemes ];  # =&gt; is_deeply [ 'spdx', 'internal' ]

           my $license = [ grep { /^(Expat|Perl)$/ } $obj-&gt;list_licenses ];  # =&gt; is_deeply ['Perl']

           # use and prefer Debian-specific identifiers
           $schemes = [ $obj-&gt;add_scheme('debian') ];  # =&gt; is_deeply [ 'debian', 'spdx', 'internal' ]

           $license = [ grep { /^(Expat|Perl)$/ } $obj-&gt;list_licenses ];  # =&gt; is_deeply [ 'Expat', 'Perl' ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       String::License::Naming enumerates supported licenses matching an ordered set of naming schemes, or
       enumerates the names of supported license naming schemes.

       Some licenses are known by different names.  E.g. the license "MIT" according to SPDX is named "Expat" in
       Debian.

       Some licenses are not always represented.  E.g. "Perl" is a (discouraged) license in Debian while it is a
       relationship of several licenses with SPDX (and that expression is recommended in Debian as well).

       By default, licenses are matched using naming schemes "[ 'spdx', 'internal' ]", which lists all supported
       licenses, preferrably by their SPDX name or as fallback by an internal name.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       new
               my $names = String::License::Naming-&gt;new;

               my $spdx_names = String::License::Naming-&gt;new( schemes =&gt; ['spdx'] );

           Constructs and returns a String::License::Naming object.

           Takes  an  optional  array as named argument <b>schemes</b>.  both ordering by which name licenses should be
           presented, and limiting which licenses to cover.

           When omitted, the default schemes array  "[  'spdx',  'internal'  ]"  is  used,  which  includes  all
           supported  licenses,  and  they are presented by their SPDX name when defined or otherwise by a semi-
           stable internal name.

           When passing an empty array reference, all supported licenses are  included,  presented  by  a  semi-
           stable internal potentially multi-word description.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       add_scheme
           Takes a string representing a license naming scheme to use, favored over existing schemes in use.

           Returns array of schemes in use after addition.

       list_schemes
           Returns a list of license naming schemes in use.

       list_available_schemes
           Returns a list of all license naming schemes available.

       list_licenses
           Returns  a  list  of  licensing  patterns  covered by this object instance, each labeled by shortname
           according to current set of schemes.
