</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Software::License::Custom - custom license handler

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.104007

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module extends Software::License to give the possibility of specifying all aspects related to a
       software license in a custom file.  This allows for setting custom dates, notices, etc. while still
       preserving compatibility with all places where Software::License is used, e.g. Dist::Zilla.

       In this way, you should be able to customise some aspects of the licensing messages that would otherwise
       be difficult to tinker, e.g. adding a note in the notice, setting multiple years for the copyright notice
       or set multiple authors and/or copyright holders.

       The license details should be put inside a file that contains different sections. Each section has the
       following format:

       header line
           This  is  a line that begins and ends with two underscores "__". The string between the begin and the
           end of the line is first depured of any non-word character, then used as the name of the section;

       body
           a Text::Template (possibly a plain text file) where items to be expanded are enclosed between  double
           braces

       Each section is terminated by the header of the following section or by the end of the file. Example:

          __[ NAME ]__
          The Foo-Bar License
          __URL__
          <a href="http://www.example.com/foo-bar.txt">http://www.example.com/foo-bar.txt</a>
          __[ META_NAME ]__
          foo_bar_meta
          __{ META2_NAME }__
          foo_bar_meta2
          __{ SPDX_EXPRESSION }__
          foo_bar_spdx_expression
          __[ NOTICE ]__
          Copyright (C) 2000-2002 by P.R. Evious
          Copyright (C) {{$self-&gt;year}} by {{$self-&gt;holder}}.

          This is free software, licensed under {{$self-&gt;name}}.

          __[ LICENSE ]__
                      The Foo-Bar License

          Well... this is only some sample text.  Verily... only sample text!!!

          Yes, spanning more lines and more paragraphs.

       The  different  formats  for  specifying  the section name in the example above are only examples, you're
       invited to use a consistent approach.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is part of CPAN toolchain, or is treated as such.  As such, it follows the agreement  of  the
       Perl  Toolchain  Gang  to require no newer version of perl than one released in the last ten years.  This
       version may change by agreement of the Toolchain Gang, but for now is governed by the Lancaster Consensus
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/toolchain-site/blob/master/lancaster-consensus.md&gt;  of  2013  and
       the Lyon Amendment of 2023 (described at the linked-to document).

       Although  it  may  work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
          my $slc = Software::License::Custom-&gt;new({filename =&gt; 'LEGAL'});

       Create a new object. Arguments are passed through an anonymous hash, the following keys are allowed:

         filename - the file where the custom software license details are stored

   <b>load_sections_from</b>
          $slc-&gt;load_sections_from('MY-LEGAL-ASPECTS');

       Loads the different sections of the license from the provided filename.

       Returns the input object.

   <b>section_data</b>
          my $notice_template_reference = $slc-&gt;section_data('NOTICE');

       Returns a reference to a textual template that can be fed to Text::Template (it could  be  simple  text),
       according to what is currently loaded in the object.

</pre><h4><b>MORE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  methods,  found in all software license classes, look up and render the template with the
       capitalized form of their name.  In other words, the "license" method looks in the "LICENSE" template.

       For now, the "meta_name" and "meta2_name" methods return "custom" if  called  on  the  class.   This  may
       become fatal in the future.

       •   name

       •   url

       •   meta_name

       •   meta2_name

       •   license

       •   notice

       •   fulltext

       •   version
