</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Software::License::GPL_2::or_later - GPLv2+ license for Software::License infrastructure

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version v0.10.2, released on 2016-10-10 22:17 UTC.

</pre><h4><b>WHAT?</b></h4><pre>
       "Software-License-OrLaterPack" (or just "OrLaterPack" for brevity) is an add-on for "Software-License", a
       set of licenses with "or later" clause (like "GPL_3::or_later"). It allows Perl developers (who use
       "Dist-Zilla") to release their work under the terms of a <u>License</u> version <u>N</u> or (at user option) any later
       version.

       This is "Software::License::GPL_2::or_later" module documentation. Read this if you are going to hack or
       extend the module, or use the module directly.

       If you want to use GNU license with "or later" clause read the user manual. General topics like getting
       source, building, installing, bug reporting and some others are covered in the <u>README</u> file.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $lic = Software::License::GPL_2::or_later-&gt;new( {
               holder  =&gt; 'John Doe',
               year    =&gt; '2010',
               program =&gt; 'Assa'
           } );

           $lic-&gt;_abbr;    # 'GPL'
           $lic-&gt;abbr;     # 'GPLv2+'
           $lic-&gt;_name;    # 'GNU General Public License'
           $lic-&gt;name;     # 'The GNU General Public License version 2 or later'

           $lic-&gt;notice;
               # Copyright statement and
               # standard GNU 3-paragraph license notice.
           $lic-&gt;notice( 'short' );
               # Copyright statement, license name and
               # two sentences about free software and warranties.

           # Xand other methods inherited from Software::License::GPL_2
           # and Software::License.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Software::License::GPL_2::or_later" is a subclass of "Software::License::GPL_2".  It overrides few
       parent methods and introduces few own methods.

       See documentation on Software::License for a general description of the class interface.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>_abbr</b>
       Bare abbreviated license name, "GPL".

       Note: this attribute is <u>not</u> inherited from the base class.

   <b>abbr</b>
       Abbreviated license name: concatenated bare abbreviated license name, 'v' character, and license version
       (with trailing plus sign).

       Note: this attribute is <u>not</u> inherited from the base class.

   <b>base</b>
       A reference to base license object, i. e. license without "or later" clause.

       Note: this attribute is <u>not</u> inherited from the base class.

   <b>_name</b>
       Bare name of the license, which is also bare name of the base license, because it does include neither
       definitive article ("The"), nor license version nor "or later" clause: "GNU General Public License".

       Note: this attribute is <u>not</u> inherited from the base class.

   <b>name</b>
       This attribute meets "Software::License" specification: returned name starts with definitive capitalized
       article ("The"). Returned name also includes the base license version (like other "Software::License"
       classes do) (without trailing plus sign) and "or later" clause.

   <b>program</b>
       A program name as specified by the "program" option in constructor, or the "Program" option in
       constructor, or "this program". This form of program name is intended to be used in the middle of
       sentence.

       Note: this attribute is <u>not</u> inherited from the base class.

   <b>Program</b>
       A program name as specified by the "Program" option in constructor, or the "program" option in
       constructor, or "This program". This form of program name is intended to be used in the beginning of
       sentence.

       Note: this attribute is <u>not</u> inherited from the base class.

   <b>version</b>
       License version (base license version with appended plus sign to denote "or later" clause).

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>notice</b>
       This method overrides Software::License's "notice". Differences are:

       •   If  the  license  object was created with "program" or "Program" or both options, notice will include
           real program name instead of generic "this program".

       •   It returns copyright statement followed by standard GNU 3-paragraph license notice.

       •   Result is formatted with Text::Wrap::fill.

       The method can be called with 'short' argument to get short version of notice.  Short  version  includes:
       copyright  statement,  license name, and two sentences about free software and warranties.  Note: This is
       experimental feature.
