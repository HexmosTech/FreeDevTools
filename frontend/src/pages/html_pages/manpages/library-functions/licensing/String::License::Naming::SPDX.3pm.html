</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       String::License::Naming::SPDX - licenses as named by SPDX

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version v0.0.11

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use String::License::Naming::SPDX;

           my $spdx = String::License::Naming::SPDX-&gt;new;

           my $license = [ grep { /^(Expat|Perl)$/ } $spdx-&gt;list_licenses ];  # =&gt; is_deeply ['Perl']

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       String::License::Naming enumerates supported licenses matching an ordered set of naming schemes, or
       enumerates the names of supported license naming schemes.

       Some licenses are known by different names.  E.g. the license "MIT" according to SPDX is named "Expat" in
       Debian.

       Some licenses are not always represented.  E.g. "Perl" is a (discouraged) license in Debian while it is a
       relationship of several licenses with SPDX (and that expression is recommended in Debian as well).

       By default, licenses are matched using naming schemes "[ 'spdx', 'internal' ]", which lists all supported
       licenses, preferrably by their SPDX name or as fallback by an internal name.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       new Constructs and returns a String::License::Naming object.

           Includes all licenses defined by SPDX, and presents them by their SPDX shortname.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       list_schemes
           Returns a list of license naming schemes in use.

       list_licenses
           Returns a list of all licensing patterns covered by SPDX, each labeled by SPDX shortname.
