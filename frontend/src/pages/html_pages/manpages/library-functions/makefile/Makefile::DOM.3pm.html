       Makefile::DOM - Simple DOM parser for Makefiles

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Makefile::DOM 0.008 released on 18 November 2014.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This library can serve as an advanced lexer for (GNU) makefiles. It parses makefiles as "documents" and
       the parsing is lossless. The results are data structures similar to DOM trees. The DOM trees hold every
       single bit of the information in the original input files, including white spaces, blank lines and
       makefile comments. That means it's possible to reproduce the original makefiles from the DOM trees. In
       addition, each node of the DOM trees is modifiable and so is the whole tree, just like the PPI module
       used for Perl source parsing and the HTML::TreeBuilder module used for parsing HTML source.

       If you're looking for a true GNU make parser that generates an AST, please see Makefile::Parser::GmakeDB
       instead.

       The interface of "Makefile::DOM" mimics the API design of PPI. In fact, I've directly stolen the source
       code and POD documentation of PPI::Node, PPI::Element, and PPI::Dumper, with the full permission from the
       author of PPI, Adam Kennedy.

       "Makefile::DOM" tries to be independent of specific makefile's syntax. The same set of DOM node types is
       supposed to get shared by different makefile DOM generators. For example, MDOM::Document::Gmake parses
       GNU makefiles and returns an instance of MDOM::Document, i.e., the root of the DOM tree while the NMAKE
       makefile lexer in the future, "MDOM::Document::Nmake", also returns instances of the MDOM::Document
       class. Later, I'll also consider adding support for dmake and bsdmake.

</pre><h4><b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>DOM</b></h4><pre>
       Makefile DOM (MDOM) is a structured set of a series of data types. They provide a flexible document model
       conformed to the makefile syntax. Below is a complete list of the 19 MDOM classes in the current
       implementation where the indentation indicates the class inheritance relationships.

           MDOM::Element
               MDOM::Node
                   MDOM::Unknown
                   MDOM::Assignment
                   MDOM::Command
                   MDOM::Directive
                   MDOM::Document
                       MDOM::Document::Gmake
                   MDOM::Rule
                       MDOM::Rule::Simple
                       MDOM::Rule::StaticPattern
               MDOM::Token
                   MDOM::Token::Bare
                   MDOM::Token::Comment
                   MDOM::Token::Continuation
                   MDOM::Token::Interpolation
                   MDOM::Token::Modifier
                   MDOM::Token::Separator
                   MDOM::Token::Whitespace

       It's not hard to see that all of the MDOM classes inherit from the MDOM::Element class. MDOM::Token and
       MDOM::Node are its direct children. The former represents a string token which is atomic from the
       perspective of the lexer while the latter represents a structured node, which usually has one or more
       children, and serves as the container for other DOM::Element objects.

       Next we'll show a few examples to demonstrate how to map DOM trees to particular makefiles.

       Case 1
           Consider the following simple "hello, world" makefile:

               all : ; echo "hello, world"

           We can use the MDOM::Dumper class provided by Makefile::DOM to dump out the internal structure of its
           corresponding MDOM tree:

               MDOM::Document::Gmake
                 MDOM::Rule::Simple
                   MDOM::Token::Bare         'all'
                   MDOM::Token::Whitespace   ' '
                   MDOM::Token::Separator    ':'
                   MDOM::Token::Whitespace   ' '
                   MDOM::Command
                     MDOM::Token::Separator    ';'
                     MDOM::Token::Whitespace   ' '
                     MDOM::Token::Bare         'echo "hello, world"'
                     MDOM::Token::Whitespace   '\n'

           In  this example, speparators ":" and ";" are all instances of the MDOM::Token::Separator class while
           spaces and new line characters are all represented as MDOM::Token::Whitespace.  The  other  two  leaf
           nodes, "all" and "echo "hello, world"" both belong to MDOM::Token::Bare.

           It's  worth  mentioning that, the space characters in the rule command "echo "hello, world"" were not
           represented as MDOM::Token::Whitespace. That's because in makefiles, the spaces in  commands  do  not
           make  any  sense  to  "make"  in  syntax;  those  spaces are usually sent to shell programs verbatim.
           Therefore, the DOM parser does not try to recognize those spaces specifially so as to  reduce  memory
           use  and the number of nodes. However, leading spaces and trailing new lines will still be recognized
           as MDOM::Token::Whitespace.

           On a higher level, it's a MDOM::Rule::Simple instance holding several "Token" and one  MDOM::Command.
           On   the  highest  level,  it's  the  root  node  of  the  whole  DOM  tree,  i.e.,  an  instance  of
           MDOM::Document::Gmake.

       Case 2
           Below is a relatively complex example:

               a: foo.c  bar.h $(baz) # hello!
                   @echo ...

           It's corresponding DOM structure is

             MDOM::Document::Gmake
               MDOM::Rule::Simple
                 MDOM::Token::Bare         'a'
                 MDOM::Token::Separator    ':'
                 MDOM::Token::Whitespace   ' '
                 MDOM::Token::Bare         'foo.c'
                 MDOM::Token::Whitespace   '  '
                 MDOM::Token::Bare         'bar.h'
                 MDOM::Token::Whitespace   '\t'
                 MDOM::Token::Interpolation   '$(baz)'
                 MDOM::Token::Whitespace      ' '
                 MDOM::Token::Comment         '# hello!'
                 MDOM::Token::Whitespace      '\n'
               MDOM::Command
                 MDOM::Token::Separator    '\t'
                 MDOM::Token::Modifier     '@'
                 MDOM::Token::Bare         'echo ...'
                 MDOM::Token::Whitespace   '\n'

           Compared to the previous example, here appears several new node types.

           The variable interpolation "$(baz)" on the first line of  the  original  makefile  corresponds  to  a
           MDOM::Token::Interpolation  node  in its MDOM tree. Similarly, the comment "# hello" corresponds to a
           MDOM::Token::Comment node.

           On the second line, the rule  command  indented  by  a  tab  character  is  still  represented  by  a
           MDOM::Command  object.  Its first child node (or its first element) is also an MDOM::Token::Seperator
           instance corresponding to that tab. The command modifier "@"  follows  the  "Separator"  immediately,
           which is of type MDOM::Token::Modifier.

       Case 3
           Now let's study a sample makefile with various global structures:

             a: b
             foo = bar
                 # hello!

           Here  on  the  top  level,  there  are  three  language structures: one rule ""a: b"", one assignment
           statement "foo = bar", and one comment "# hello!".

           Its MDOM tree is shown below:

             MDOM::Document::Gmake
               MDOM::Rule::Simple
                 MDOM::Token::Bare                  'a'
                 MDOM::Token::Separator            ':'
                 MDOM::Token::Whitespace           ' '
                 MDOM::Token::Bare                   'b'
                 MDOM::Token::Whitespace           '\n'
               MDOM::Assignment
                 MDOM::Token::Bare                  'foo'
                 MDOM::Token::Whitespace           ' '
                 MDOM::Token::Separator            '='
                 MDOM::Token::Whitespace           ' '
                 MDOM::Token::Bare                  'bar'
                 MDOM::Token::Whitespace           '\n'
               MDOM::Token::Whitespace            '\t'
               MDOM::Token::Comment               '# hello!'
               MDOM::Token::Whitespace            '\n'

           We  can  see  that  below  the  root  node  MDOM::Document::Gmake,  there   are   MDOM::Rule::Simple,
           MDOM::Assignment, and MDOM::Comment three elements, as well as two MDOM::Token::Whitespace objects.

       It  can  be  observed  from  the  examples  above that the MDOM representation for the makefile's lexical
       elements is rather loose. It only provides very limited structural representation instead of making a bad
       guess.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>MDOM</b> <b>TREES</b></h4><pre>
       Generating an MDOM tree from a GNU makefile only requires two lines of Perl code:

           use MDOM::Document::Gmake;
           my $dom = MDOM::Document::Gmake-&gt;new('Makefile');

       If the makefile source code being parsed is already stored in a Perl variable, say,  $var,  then  we  can
       construct an MDOM via the following code:

           my $dom = MDOM::Document::Gmake-&gt;new(\$var);

       Now  $dom  becomes  the reference to the root of the MDOM tree and its type is now MDOM::Document::Gmake,
       which is also an instance of the MDOM::Node class.

       Just as mentioned above, "MDOM::Node" is the container for  other  MDOM::Element  instances.  So  we  can
       retrieve some element node's value via its "child" method:

           $node = $dom-&gt;<a href="../man3/child.3.html">child</a>(3);
           # or $node = $dom-&gt;<a href="../man0/elements.0.html">elements</a>(0);

       And we may also use the "elements" method to obtain the values of all the nodes:

           @elems = $dom-&gt;elements;

       For every MDOM node, its corresponding makefile source can be generated by invoking its "content" method.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       The  current  implementation  of the MDOM::Document::Gmake lexer is based on a hand-written state machie.
       Although the efficiency of the engine is not bad, the code is rather complicated and messy,  which  hurts
       both extensibility and maintanabilty. So it's expected to rewrite the parser using some grammatical tools
       like the Perl 6 regex engine Pugs::Compiler::Rule or a yacc-style one like Parse::Yapp.
