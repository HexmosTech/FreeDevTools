</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>MBPT2_R12</b> class implements several linear R12 second-order perturbation theory methods.

</pre><h4><b>Constructor</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Destructor</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>sc::MBPT2_R12::MBPT2_R12</b> <b>(const</b> <b>Ref&lt;</b> <b>KeyVal</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>&amp;)</b>
       The <b>KeyVal</b> constructor.

       <b>gbc</b>
           This  boolean specifies whether Generalized Brillouin Condition (GBC) is assumed to hold. The default
           is 'true'. This keyword is only valid if stdapprox=A'. The effect of setting this keyword to true  is
           rather small -- hence it is not recommended to use this keyword.

       <b>ebc</b>
           This  boolean specifies whether Extended Brillouin Condition (EBC) is assumed to hold. The default is
           'true'. This keyword is only valid if stdapprox=A'. The effect of setting this  keyword  to  true  is
           rather small -- hence it is not recommended to use this keyword.

       <b>stdapprox</b>
           This gives a string that must take on one of the values below. The default is A'.

       <b>A</b>   Use second order M/ller-Plesset perturbation theory with linear R12 terms in standard approximation A
           (MP2-R12/A). Only energies can be computed with the MP2-R12/A method.

       <b>A'</b>  Use  second  order M/ller-Plesset perturbation theory with linear R12 terms in standard approximation
           A' (MP2-R12/A'). This will cause MP2-R12/A energies  to  be  computed  also.  Only  energies  can  be
           computed with the MP2-R12/A' method.

       <b>B</b>   Use  second  order M/ller-Plesset perturbation theory with linear R12 terms in standard approximation
           B. This method is not implemented yet.

       <b>spinadapted</b>
           This boolean specifies whether to compute spin-adapted or spin-orbital pair energies. Default  is  to
           compute spin-adapted energies.

       <b>aux_basis</b>
           This  specifies  the auxiliary basis to be used for the resolution of the identity. Default is to use
           the same basis as for the orbital expansion.

       <b>vir_basis</b>
           This specifies the basis to be used for the virtual orbitals. Default is to use the same basis as for
           the orbital expansion.

       <b>include_mp1</b>
           This specifies whether to compute MP1 correction to the MP2 and MP2-R12 energies.  This  option  only
           has  effect  if  vir_basis is not the same as basis. MP1 correction is a perturbative estimate of the
           difference between the HF energy computed in vir_basis and basis. Usually, it is a very poor estimate
           -- therefore this keyword should be avoided by non-experts. Default is false.

       <b>abs_method</b>
           This string specifies whether the old ABS method, introduced by Klopper and Samson, or  the  new  ABS
           variant,  CABS,  introduced  by  Valeev, should be used. Valid values are 'ABS' (Klopper and Samson),
           'ABS+', 'CABS', and 'CABS+', where the '+' labels a method where the union of OBS and ABS is used  to
           construct the RI basis. The default is 'ABS'. The default in 2.3.0 and later will be 'CABS+'.

       <b>lindep_tol</b>
           The  tolerance  used  to  detect  linearly dependent basis functions in the RI basis set. The precise
           meaning depends on the orthogonalization method. The default value is 1e-8.

       <b>r12ints</b>
           This specifies how to store transformed MO integrals. Valid values are:

       <b>mem-posix</b>
           Store integrals in memory for single-pass situations and in a binary file  on  task  0's  node  using
           POSIX I/O for multipass situations. posix is usually less efficient than mpi for distributed parallel
           multipass  runs  since  the  I/O is performed by one task only. However, this method is guaranteed to
           work in all types of environments, hence mem-posix is the default.

       <b>posix</b>
           Store integrals in a binary file on task 0's node using POSIX I/O. This method is different from mem-
           posix in that it forces the integrals out to disk even if they  could  be  stored  in  memory.  posix
           should only be used for benchmarking and testing purposes.

       <b>mem-mpi</b>
           Store integrals in memory for single-pass situations and in a binary file using MPI-I/O for multipass
           situations.  This  method  assumes  the  availability  of MPI-I/O. mem-mpi is the preferred choice in
           distributed environments which have MPI-I/O available.

       <b>mpi</b>
           Store integrals in a binary file using MPI-I/O. This method is different  from  mem-mpi  in  that  it
           forces  the integrals out to disk even if they could be stored in memory. mpi should only be used for
           benchmarking and testing purposes.

       <b>mem</b>
           Store integrals in memory. Can only be  used  with  single-pass  transformations  for  MP2-R12/A  and
           MP2-R12/A' methods. This method should only be used for testing purposes.

       If  r12ints  is not specified, then mem-posix method will be used. If user wishes to use MPI-I/O, pending
       its availability, for higher parallel efficiency, r12ints should be explicitly set to mem-mpi.

       <b>r12ints_file</b>
           This specifies the prefix for the transformed MO integrals file if r12ints is set to posix, mpi, mem-
           posix or mem-mpi is used. Default is './&lt;i&gt;inputbasename&lt;/i&gt;.r12ints',  where  <u>inputbasename</u>  is  the
           name  of  the input file without '.in'. If MPI-I/O is used then it is user's responsibility to ensure
           that the file resides on a file system that supports MPI-I/O.

       <b>twopdm_grid_aa</b>
           This optional keyword specifies a <b>TwoBodyGrid</b> object which to use for coordinates at which to compute
           alpha-alpha part of 2-PDM.

       <b>twopdm_grid_ab</b>
           This optional keyword specifies a <b>TwoBodyGrid</b> object which to use for coordinates at which to compute
           alpha-beta part of 2-PDM.
