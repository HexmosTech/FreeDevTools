</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       console - Control the console on systems without a real console

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>console</b> <u>subcommand</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  console  window  is  a  replacement for a real console to allow input and output on the standard I/O
       channels on platforms that do not have a real console.  It is implemented as a separate interpreter  with
       the  Tk  toolkit  loaded,  and  control  over this interpreter is given through the <b>console</b> command.  The
       behaviour of the console window is defined mainly through the contents of the <u>console.tcl</u> file in the  Tk
       library. Except for TkAqua, this command is not available when Tk is loaded into a tclsh interpreter with
       “<b>package</b> <b>require</b> <b>Tk</b>”, as a conventional terminal is expected to be present in that case.  In TkAqua, this
       command  is  disabled  when  there is a startup script and stdin is <b>/dev/null</b> (as is the case e.g. when a
       bundled application embedding Tk is started by the macOS Launcher).  To enable the command in that  case,
       define  the environment variable <b>TK_CONSOLE</b>.  This can be done by modifying the Info.plist file by adding
       the LSEnvironment key to the main dict and setting its value to be a dict with the key <b>TK_CONSOLE</b>.

       <b>console</b> <b>eval</b> <u>script</u>
              Evaluate the <u>script</u> argument as a Tcl script in the console interpreter.  The  normal  interpreter
              is accessed through the <b>consoleinterp</b> command in the console interpreter.

       <b>console</b> <b>hide</b>
              Hide  the  console  window  from  view.   Precisely  equivalent to withdrawing the <b>.</b> window in the
              console interpreter.

       <b>console</b> <b>show</b>
              Display the console window.  Precisely equivalent to deiconifying the  <b>.</b>  window  in  the  console
              interpreter.

       <b>console</b> <b>title</b> ?<u>string</u>?
              Query or modify the title of the console window.  If <u>string</u> is not specified, queries the title of
              the  console  window,  and  sets  the  title of the console window to <u>string</u> otherwise.  Precisely
              equivalent to using the <b>wm</b> <b>title</b> command in the console interpreter.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>THE</b> <b>MAIN</b> <b>INTERPRETER</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>consoleinterp</b> command in the  console  interpreter  allows  scripts  to  be  evaluated  in  the  main
       interpreter.  It supports two subcommands: <b>eval</b> and <b>record</b>.

       <b>consoleinterp</b> <b>eval</b> <u>script</u>
              Evaluates <u>script</u> as a Tcl script at the global level in the main interpreter.

       <b>consoleinterp</b> <b>record</b> <u>script</u>
              Records  and  evaluates  <u>script</u>  as a Tcl script at the global level in the main interpreter as if
              <u>script</u> had been typed in at the console.

</pre><h4><b>ADDITIONAL</b> <b>TRAP</b> <b>CALLS</b></h4><pre>
       There are several additional commands in the console interpreter that are called in response to  activity
       in the main interpreter.  <u>These</u> <u>are</u> <u>documented</u> <u>here</u> <u>for</u> <u>completeness</u> <u>only;</u> <u>they</u> <u>form</u> <u>part</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>internal</u>
       <u>implementation</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>console</u> <u>and</u> <u>are</u> <u>likely</u> <u>to</u> <u>change</u> <u>or</u> <u>be</u> <u>modified</u> <u>without</u> <u>warning.</u>

       Output to the console from the main interpreter via the stdout and stderr channels is handled by invoking
       the  <b>tk::ConsoleOutput</b>  command in the console interpreter with two arguments.  The first argument is the
       name of the channel being written to, and the second argument is the string being written to the  channel
       (after encoding and end-of-line translation processing has been performed.)

       When  the  <b>.</b>  window  of  the  main  interpreter is destroyed, the <b>tk::ConsoleExit</b> command in the console
       interpreter is called (assuming the console interpreter has not already been deleted itself, that is.)

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The default script creates a console window (implemented using a text  widget)  that  has  the  following
       behaviour:

       [1]    Pressing the tab key inserts a TAB character (as defined by the Tcl \t escape.)

       [2]    Pressing  the return key causes the current line (if complete by the rules of <b>info</b> <b>complete</b>) to be
              passed to the main interpreter for evaluation.

       [3]    Pressing the delete key deletes the selected text (if any text is selected) or  the  character  to
              the right of the cursor (if not at the end of the line.)

       [4]    Pressing the backspace key deletes the selected text (if any text is selected) or the character to
              the left of the cursor (of not at the start of the line.)

       [5]    Pressing  either  Control+A  or the home key causes the cursor to go to the start of the line (but
              after the prompt, if a prompt is present on the line.)

       [6]    Pressing either Control+E or the end key causes the cursor to go to the end of the line.

       [7]    Pressing either Control+P or the up key causes the previous entry in the  command  history  to  be
              selected.

       [8]    Pressing  either  Control+N  or  the  down  key causes the next entry in the command history to be
              selected.

       [9]    Pressing either Control+B or the left key causes the cursor to move one character backward as long
              as the cursor is not at the prompt.

       [10]   Pressing either Control+F or the right key causes the cursor to move one character forward.

       [11]   Pressing F9 rebuilds the console window by destroying all  its  children  and  reloading  the  Tcl
              script that defined the console's behaviour.

       Most  other behaviour is the same as a conventional text widget except for the way that the <u>&lt;&lt;Cut&gt;&gt;</u> event
       is handled identically to the <u>&lt;&lt;Copy&gt;&gt;</u> event.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Not all platforms have the <b>console</b> command, so debugging code often has the following code fragment in it
       so output produced by <b>puts</b> can be seen while during development:
              catch {<b>console</b> <b>show</b>}
