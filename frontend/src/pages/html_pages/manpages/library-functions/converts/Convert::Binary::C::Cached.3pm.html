       Convert::Binary::C::Cached - Caching for Convert::Binary::C

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Convert::Binary::C::Cached;
         use Data::Dumper;

         #------------------------
         # Create a cached object
         #------------------------
         $c = Convert::Binary::C::Cached-&gt;new(
                Cache   =&gt; '/tmp/cache.c',
                Include =&gt; [
                  '/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.2.0/include',
                  '/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.2.0/include-fixed',
                  '<a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a>',
                ],
              );

         #----------------------------------------------------
         # Parse 'time.h' and dump the definition of timespec
         #----------------------------------------------------
         $c-&gt;parse_file('time.h');

         print Dumper($c-&gt;struct('timespec'));

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Convert::Binary::C::Cached simply adds caching capability to Convert::Binary::C. You can use it in just
       the same way that you would use Convert::Binary::C. The interface is exactly the same.

       To use the caching capability, you must pass the "Cache" option to the constructor. If you don't pass it,
       you will receive an ordinary Convert::Binary::C object. The argument to the "Cache" option is the file
       that is used for caching this object.

       The caching algorithm automatically detects when the cache file cannot be used and the original code has
       to be parsed.  In that case, the cache file is updated. An update of the cache file can be triggered by
       one or more of the following factors:

       • The cache file doesn't exist, which is obvious.

       • The cache file is corrupt, i.e. cannot be parsed.

       • The object's configuration has changed.

       • The embedded code for a "parse" method call has changed.

       • At  least  one  of  the  files  that  the object depends on does not exist or has a different size or a
         different modification or change timestamp.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       You cannot call "parse" or "parse_file" more that once when using  a  Convert::Binary::C::Cached  object.
       This isn't a big problem, as you usually don't call them multiple times.

       If  a  dependency  file changes, but the change affects neither the size nor the timestamps of that file,
       the caching algorithm cannot detect that an update is required.
