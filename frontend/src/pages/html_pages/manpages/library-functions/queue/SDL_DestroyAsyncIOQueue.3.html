</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_DestroyAsyncIOQueue - Destroy a previously-created async I/O task queue.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;SDL3/SDL_asyncio.h&gt;</b>

       <b>void</b> <b>SDL_DestroyAsyncIOQueue(SDL_AsyncIOQueue</b> <b>*queue);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If there are still tasks pending for this queue, this call will block until those tasks are finished. All
       those tasks will be deallocated. Their results will be lost to the app.

       Any  pending  reads  from  <b>SDL_LoadFileAsync</b>()  that  are  still  in  this  queue will have their buffers
       deallocated by this function, to prevent a memory leak.

       Once this function is called, the queue is no longer valid and should not be  used,  including  by  other
       threads that might access it while destruction is blocking on pending tasks.

       Do  not  destroy  a  queue that still has threads waiting on it through <b>SDL_WaitAsyncIOResult</b>().  You can
       call  <b>SDL_SignalAsyncIOQueue</b>()  first  to  unblock  those   threads,   and   take   measures   (such   as
       <b>SDL_WaitThread</b>()) to make sure they have finished their wait and won't wait on the queue again.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>queue</u>  the task queue to destroy.

</pre><h4><b>THREAD</b> <b>SAFETY</b></h4><pre>
       It is safe to call this function from any thread, so long as no other thread is waiting on the queue with
       <b>SDL_WaitAsyncIOResult</b>.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
