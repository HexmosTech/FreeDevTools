</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Conrec_family - is a set of two dimensional contour mapping routines.  There are options for generating
       standard contours, smoothing contour lines, labeling the contours, and removing crowded lines.

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       Conrec_family is obsolete.  It has been replaced by the contouring package, Conpack.  See the Conpack
       entry CPCNRC for a simple CONREC replacement.  For more complex examples refer to the conpack and
       conpack_params man pages as well as the NCAR Graphics Contouring and Mapping Tutorial.

       Conrec_family continues to be provided for compatibility of early NCAR Graphics codes.  If you are
       writing new code, we suggest that you use the more general and rigorous Conpack contouring package.  All
       Conrec_family options are available via Conpack parameters.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       EZCNTR(Z,M,N) - draws a contour map based upon a set of default options.
       CONREC(Z,L,M,N,FLO,HI,FINC,NSET,NHI,NDOT) - draws a contour map using options specified as input
       arguments.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       The Conrec family contains only two user callable entries, EZCNTR, and CONREC.  However, these two
       entries can be invoked in four different ways to create contour plots which vary considerably in
       appearance.  The four variations include quick, normal, smooth, and super contour lines.  This
       progression represents a tradeoff between speed of computation and the appearance of the contour plots.
       These variations are specified through selected command line options of the ncargf77 command.

       To use EZCNTR or CONREC, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.  Other optional libraries to create the quick, smooth, and super contours will automatically
       be linked by the ncargf77 command.  To run a code called mycode.f which has one or more calls to entry
       EZCNTR or CONREC, issue one of the commands:

       NORMAL    Command:  "ncargf77 mycode.f"

                 The  contours  will  be  drawn  as unsmoothed dashed or solid lines that can include characters
                 along the lines.

       QUICK     Command:  "ncargf77 -quick mycode.f"

                 The contours will be drawn as unsmoothed dashed or solid lines  without  characters  along  the
                 lines.   The  QUICK  drawing  algorithm  is faster and cruder than that used for NORMAL contour
                 lines.  QUICK uses  a  cell-by-cell  analysis  rather  than  following  each  contour  line  to
                 completion in sequence as is done in the NORMAL algorithm.

       SMOOTH    Command:  "ncargf77 -smooth mycode.f"

                 The  contours  will  be  drawn  as  smoothed dashed or solid lines using splines under tension.
                 There may be characters along the lines.

       SUPER     Command:  "ncargf77 -super mycode.f"

                 The contours will be drawn as smoothed dashed or  solid  lines  using  splines  under  tension.
                 There may be characters along the lines.  Crowded lines can be thinned.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       When  error  conditions  are detected, the support routine SETER is called in such a way that it writes a
       message to the standard error file (as defined by <a href="../man4/I1MACH.4.html">I1MACH</a>(4)) and then terminates execution. The  possible
       error messages are as follows:

       CONREC  - DIMENSION ERROR - M*N .GT. (2**IARTH)
       The  array to be contoured is dimensioned M by N.  This is larger than the address space on this computer
       (2**IARTH) where IARTH is the size of an address integer.  Check your dimension sizes.

       STLINE  - WARNING FROM ROUTINE STLINE IN CONREC--WORK ARRAY OVERFLOW
       This warning message is printed to standard output if the number of contour lines  for  a  contour  level
       would exceed the dimension size of work array IR in routine STLINE.

       Should this happen the following messages are also sent to the output plot file:

       **WARNING--PICTURE INCOMPLETE**
       WORK ARRAY OVERFLOW IN STLINE

       Processing stops before the actual array overflow occurs and control is returned to the calling program.
