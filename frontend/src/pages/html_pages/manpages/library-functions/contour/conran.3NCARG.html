</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CONRAN - draws a two dimensional contour map from irregularly distributed data.  The contour lines may be
       smoothed.

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       CONRAN is approaching obsolescence.  If you have available an interpolation package which can do a random
       to gridded interpolation equal to that built into the Conran_family, then we recommend that you grid your
       dataset and use the Conpack utility instead.  Refer to the conpack and conpack_params man pages as well
       as the NCAR Graphics Contouring and Mapping Tutorial.

</pre><h4><b>UTILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This routine is part of the Conran_family in NCAR Graphics.  To see the overview man page for this
       utility, type "man conran_family".

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CONRAN (XD,YD,ZD,NDP,WK,IWK,SCRARR)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       XD          Input, real array -- of dimension NDP containing the X coordinates of the data points.

       YD          Input, real array -- of dimension NDP containing the Y coordinates of the data points.

       ZD          Input, real array -- of dimension NDP containing the data values at the points.

       NDP         Input, integer -- is the number of data points to be contoured.  NDP must be 4 or larger.

       WK          Input, real array -- workspace of dimension 15*NDP.

       IWK         Input, integer array -- workspace which must be dimensioned at least IWK((27+NCP)*NDP).

                   The  parameter  NCP  controls  the  number  of  data  points to be used in the interpolation.
                   Increasing NCP causes more of the surrounding data to influence the point  of  interpolation.
                   In  the  case  of linear interpolation NCP is always 4.  In the case of C1 interpolation, NCP
                   can vary from 2 to 25 with 4 as the default.

                   The interpolation option is selected using parameter ITP.  See the  conran_family_params  man
                   page for a description of all internal parameters.

       SCRARR      Real work array of dimension at least (RESOLUTION**2) where RESOLUTION is 40 by default.

                   Alternate resolutions are set using parameter SSZ.  See the conran_family_params man page.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  contours  will be drawn as smoothed dashed or solid lines using splines under tension.  There may be
       characters along the lines.  Many other options are available through the  use  of  internal  parameters.
       See the conran_family_params man page.

       Quick  and  super  versions  of  the  Conran_family are also available through entries CONRAQ and CONRAS,
       respectively.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the relevant example tconan.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       CONRAN can be invoked in two different ways.  The standard version produces contour plots  which  connect
       interpolated values on the boundary of the interpolation triangles.  The smooth version produces contours
       which are smoothed using splines under tension.

       To  use  standard  CONRAN,  load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.  To run the smooth option an additional library, dashsmth is needed.  It can be loaded by the
       user directly, along with the above three standard libraries, or loaded implicitly through the use of the
       -smooth option of the ncargf77 command.  To run a code called mycode.f which has one  or  more  calls  to
       entry CONRAN, issue one of the commands:

       NORMAL    Command: "ncargf77 mycode.f"

                 The  contours  will  be  drawn  as unsmoothed dashed or solid lines that can include characters
                 along the lines.

       SMOOTH    Command: "ncargf77 -smooth mycode.f"

                 The contours will be drawn as smoothed dashed or solid lines that can include characters  along
                 the lines.
