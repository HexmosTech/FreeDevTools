</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Conran_family - is a set of two dimensional contour mapping routines for irregularly distributed data.

       There are three Conran_family entries, CONRAN, CONRAQ, and CONRAS.  CONRAN can be invoked in two ways.
       One generates smoothed contours, the other does not.  CONRAQ is a quick version of the package which has
       a more limited set of options than the other entries.  CONRAS is the super version of the package.

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The Conran_family is approaching obsolescence.  If you have available an interpolation package which can
       do a random to gridded interpolation equal to that built into the Conran_family, then we recommend that
       you grid your dataset and use the Conpack utility instead.  Refer to the conpack and conpack_params man
       pages as well as the NCAR Graphics Contouring and Mapping Tutorial.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CONRAN - Provides the standard and smooth versions for contouring of irregularly gridded data.

       CONRAQ - Provides the quick form of the package.  It does not have as many available options as the other
       entries.

       CONRAS - This is the super version of the package.  Not only does it smooth and label contour lines, it
       can also reduce line crowding.

       CONOP1 - Sets values of internal parameters of type logical.  Specifically, CONOP1 is used to turn
       options "OFF", or "ON".

       CONOP2 - Sets values of internal parameters of type integer.

       CONOP3 - Sets values of internal parameters of type real.

       CONOP4 - Sets values of internal parameters of type character.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       There are three entries in the Conran_family which create contour plots: CONRAQ (quick), CONRAS (super),
       and CONRAN (standard and smooth.)

       To use standard CONRAN, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.  To run any of the other three options (quick, super, or smooth), one or more additional
       libraries is needed as follows:

       quick -- additionally load the conraq library.

       smooth -- additionally load the dashsmth library.

       super -- additionally load the conras and dashsupr libraries.

       These libraries can also be implicitly loaded by using the -quick, -smooth, or -super option of the
       ncargf77 command.  For example, to run a code called mycode.f which has one or more calls to a
       Conran_family entry, issue one of the commands:

       QUICK     Command: "ncargf77 -quick mycode.f"

                 mycode.f has one or more calls to entry CONRAQ.

       NORMAL    Command: "ncargf77 mycode.f"

                 mycode.f has one or more calls to entry CONRAN.

       SMOOTH    Command: "ncargf77 -smooth mycode.f"

                 mycode.f has one or more calls to entry CONRAN.

       SUPER     Command: "ncargf77 -super mycode.f"

                 mycode.f has one or more calls to entry CONRAS.

                 Warning:  mycode.f can only call one of the three entries, CONRAQ, CONRAN, or CONRAS.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       Error messages generated by CONRAN routines include:

       CONCLS    CONSTANT INPUT FIELD
                 The  input  data  all has a constant value.  This may indicate that the data has not been input
                 correctly in the user program.

       CONDRW    CONTOUR STORAGE EXHAUSTED
                 This error is trapped and nullified by CONRAN.  It serves to signal the  user  that  a  contour
                 level may not be complete.

       CONOP     UNDEFINED OPTION
                 The  parameter  name  has  either been misspelled in a CONOP call, or an out of range parameter
                 value has been specified.  This message can be generated by CONOP1, CONOP2, CONOP3, or CONOP4.

       CONOP3    ILLEGAL USE OF CON OPTION WITH CIL OR CHL OPTIONS
                 Review the definitions of these three parameters using man page conran_family_params.

       CONOP3    NUMBER OF CONTOUR LEVELS EXCEEDS 30
                 Reduce the requested number of contour levels specified by parameter CON to 30 or less.

       CONRAN    INPUT PARAMETER NDP LT NCP
                 NDP is the total number of input values for contouring.  NCP is the number of points  used  for
                 partial  derivative  estimation.   NCP  cannot  exceed  NDP.  This error message also occurs in
                 CONRAS and CONRAQ.

       CONRAN    NCP LT 2 OR GT NCPSZ
                 The legal value of NCP must be between NCPSZ  (dimension  size  allowed)  and  2.   This  error
                 message also occurs in CONRAS and CONRAQ.

       CONSTP    ASPECT RATIO OF X AND Y GREATER THAN 5 TO 1.
                 (This  error may cause a poor quality plot.  Usually this can be fixed by multiplying X or Y by
                 a constant factor.  If this solution is unacceptable then increasing internal parameter SSZ  to
                 a very large value may help.  Note:  This can be expensive.)

       CONTNG    ALL COLINEAR DATA POINTS
                 Indicates  that  the  input  data  set  to  be contoured all lies along a straight line.  Thus,
                 triangulation cannot occur.

       CONTNG    IDENTICAL INPUT DATA POINTS FOUND

                 The errors listed above are defined as recoverable errors should the user wish to use  them  in
                 that fashion.  The documentation on the ERPRT77 package explains how to recover from an error.
