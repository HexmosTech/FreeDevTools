</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Conpack - Provides a sort of tool kit of FORTRAN subroutines that can be called in various combinations
       to draw different kinds of contour plots.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CPBACK - Draws a background for a contour plot.

       CPCICA - Incorporates into a user's cell array color indices determined by examining where the user's
       contours lie relative to the cell array.

       CPCLAM - Adds contour lines to an area map. This is part of the process of drawing a solid-fill contour
       plot.

       CPCLDM - Draws contour lines masked by an existing area map. The object of this may be simply to avoid
       drawing contour lines through label boxes, but the routine may be used for more complicated tasks, like
       limiting the drawing of contour lines to the ocean areas on an Ezmap background.

       CPCLDR - Draws contour lines.

       CPCLTR - Traces the contour lines at a given level and retrieves them for some sort of user-defined
       processing.

       CPCNRC - Draws black and white contours with a single call.  Simulates the behavior of the old routine
       CONREC; it has the same arguments and produces similar output.

       CPEZCT - Draws black and white contours with a single call.  Simulates the behavior of the old subroutine
       EZCNTR in Conrec_family; it has the same arguments and will produce similar output.

       CPGETC - Retrieves the current value of an internal parameter of type CHARACTER.

       CPGETI - Retrieves the current value of an internal parameter of type INTEGER.

       CPGETR - Retrieves the current value of an internal parameter of type REAL.

       CPLBAM - Adds label boxes (for the informational label, high and low labels, and contour-line labels) to
       an area map. The ultimate object of this will usually be to prevent contour lines drawn by CPCLDM from
       passing through labels or to prevent fill of the label boxes as contour bands are filled.

       CPLBDR - Draws labels (an informational label, high and low labels, and line labels).

       CPMVIW - Moves the contents of an old integer workspace to a new one.

       CPMVRW - Moves the contents of an old real workspace to a new one.

       CPPKCL - Picks a set of contour levels.

       CPPKLB - Picks a set of labels for labeled contour levels.

       CPRECT - Initializes the contouring of a rectangular array of data.

       CPRSET - Resets all parameters to their initial default values.

       CPSETC - Sets the value of an internal parameter of type CHARACTER.

       CPSETI - Sets the value of an internal parameter of type INTEGER.

       CPSETR - Sets the value of an internal parameter of type REAL.

       CPSPS1 - Interpolates from an array of data on a "sparse" rectangular grid which is regularly spaced in X
       and Y to an array of data on a "dense" rectangular grid and to initialize contouring from the array on
       the dense grid. (By a "sparse" grid is meant one whose dimensions are smaller than one would like, so
       that contour lines constructed directly on it are composed of long straight segments.) CPSPS1 may be
       viewed as a data smoothing routine.

       CPSPS2 - Interpolates from an array of data on a "sparse" rectangular grid which is irregularly spaced in
       X and Y to an array of data on a "dense" rectangular grid and to initialize contouring from the array on
       the dense grid. (By a "sparse" grid is meant one whose dimensions are smaller than one would like, so
       that contour lines constructed directly on it are composed of long straight segments.) CPSPS2 may be
       viewed as a data smoothing routine.

</pre><h4><b>USER-MODIFIABLE</b> <b>INTERNAL</b> <b>ROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       CPCHCF - Provides user control as a constant-field message is drawn.

       CPCHCL - Provides user control as contour lines are drawn.

       CPCHHL - Provides user control as high and low labels are drawn.

       CPCHIL - Provides user control as the informational label is drawn.

       CPCHLL - Provides user control as contour line labels are drawn.

       CPDRPL - Provides a useful polyline-drawer for the routine CPCLDM.

       CPMPXY - Maps Conpack output from a rectangular coordinate system superimposed on the data grid to some
       other coordinate system.

       CPSCAE - Updates a particular element of a user's cell array.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use the Conpack Fortran or C routines, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c,
       preferably in that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       Various error conditions can occur in Conpack.  Each of these results in a call to the error-handling
       routine SETER, with a final argument indicating that the error is recoverable; by default, an error
       message is printed and execution is terminated, but, if you turn on error recovery (as described in the
       "man" page for "error_handling"), you can get control back.

       The error messages are as follows:
