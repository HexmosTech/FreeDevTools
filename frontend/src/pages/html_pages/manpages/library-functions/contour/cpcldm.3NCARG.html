       CPCLDM - Draws contour lines masked by an existing area map. The object of this may be simply to avoid
       drawing contour lines through label boxes, but the routine may be used for more complicated tasks, like
       limiting the drawing of contour lines to the ocean areas on an Ezmap background.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL CPCLDM (ZDAT, RWRK, IWRK, IAMA, RTPL)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_cpcldm (float *zdat, float *rwrk, int *iwrk,
       int *iama, int (*rtpl)(float *xcs, float *ycs, int *ncs,
       int *iai, int *iag, int *nai))

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The first three arguments are arrays used in the last call to CPRECT, CPSPS1, or CPSPS2, the contents of
       which must not have been changed since that call.

       ZDAT        (REAL  array,  dimensioned as specified in the last call to CPRECT, CPSPS1, or CPSPS2, input)
                   is the data array.

       RWRK        (REAL array, dimensioned as specified  in  the  last  call  to  CPRECT,  CPSPS1,  or  CPSPS2,
                   input/output) is the real workspace array.

       IWRK        (INTEGER  array,  dimensioned  as  specified  in  the last call to CPRECT, CPSPS1, or CPSPS2,
                   input/output) is the integer workspace array.

       IAMA        (INTEGER array, dimensioned as  specified  in  a  call  to  ARINAM,  in  the  package  Areas,
                   input/output)  is  the  array containing the area map which is to be used to mask the contour
                   lines as they are drawn.

       RTPL        (EXTERNAL subroutine) is the user subroutine which is to process the polylines  which  result
                   from  masking  the  generated  contour lines and other edges against the area map. It must be
                   declared EXTERNAL in the routine which calls CPCLDM. It will be called  repeatedly  and  must
                   have the following form:

                        SUBROUTINE RTPL (XCS,YCS,NCS,IAI,IAG,NAI)
                            DIMENSION XCS(*),YCS(*),IAI(*),IAG(*)
                            ...
                            (CODE TO PROCESS POLYLINE DEFINED BY ARGUMENTS)
                            ...
                          RETURN
                        END

                   The  real  arrays  XCS and YCS hold the X and Y coordinates of NCS points defining a polyline
                   which is to be considered for drawing. For each I greater than or equal to 1 and less than or
                   equal to NAI, IAI(I) is the area identifier for the area in which the polyline lies, relative
                   to the area-identifier group IAG(I). The X  and  Y  coordinates  are  all  normalized  device
                   coordinates  and  it  may  be  assumed  that the appropriate SET call has been done. If it is
                   decided to draw the line, it may be done with a call  to  the  SPPS  routine  CURVE,  to  the
                   Dashline  routine CURVED, or to the GKS routine GPL. The value of 'PAI' will have been set to
                   the appropriate value (1 through 'NCL', -1, -2, or -3) for the line of which the polyline  is
                   a  part.  The  color  and  line  width  will  have  been  set as implied by the values of the
                   appropriate elements of the parameter arrays 'CLC' and 'CLL'. The dash pattern will have been
                   defined as implied by the value of the appropriate elements of the parameter arrays 'CLD' and
                   'CLU' and the value of the parameter 'DPU'. If a dash pattern is defined, it may be retrieved
                   by a "CALL CPGETC ('CTM',CVAL)".

                   If the only object of using CPCLDM is to avoid drawing contour  lines  through  label  boxes,
                   then  the  Conpack  routine  CPDRPL  may  be used for RTPL. In the routine that calls CPCLDM,
                   insert the declaration

                        EXTERNAL CPDRPL

                   and then use CPDRPL for the last argument.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The routine CPCLDM may be called at any time after the initialization call to CPRECT, CPSPS1,  or  CPSPS2
       to  draw  contour  lines  masked  by  an existing area map.  Actually, CPCLDM does not draw the lines; it
       generates them, masks them against a user-specified area map, and generates calls, one for each  polyline
       resulting from the masking process, to the user specified routine RTPL.  Each such polyline lies entirely
       within  precisely  one  of  the  areas defined by the area map.  The routine RTPL may use the information
       provided by its arguments, describing the area the polyline is in, to decide whether or not to  draw  the
       polyline.

       The contour lines generated are those specified by the first 'NCL' elements of the parameter arrays 'CLV'
       and 'CLU'.  If 'NCL' is zero, CPPKCL is called to generate these values.  Each element of 'CLV' specifies
       a  contour  level and the corresponding element of 'CLU' specifies whether or not contour lines are to be
       generated at that level.  If the parameter 'T2D' has a non-zero value, the contour  lines  are  smoothed,
       using cubic splines under tension.

       If the element of the parameter array 'CLU' corresponding to 'PAI' = -1 is non-zero, the edge of the grid
       is  also  generated.   If  the  element  of  'CLU'  corresponding to 'PAI' = -2 is non-zero, the edges of
       special-value areas, if any, are generated.  If the element of 'CLU' corresponding to 'PAI' = -3 is  non-
       zero,  the  edges of out-of-range areas, if any, are generated.  The default values are such that none of
       these edges is generated.

       Groups of lines are generated in the following order:

       •  contour lines for each of the specified levels, in ascending numeric order,

       •  the edges of special-value areas, if any,

       •  the edges of out-of-range areas, if any, and

       •  the edge of the grid.

       The color, dash pattern, and line width to be used for the lines drawn may be specified  by  elements  of
       the   parameter  arrays  'CLC',  'CLD',  and  'CLL',  respectively.   Each  of  these  contains  elements
       corresponding to values of 'PAI' from 1 to 'NCL' and three special elements, corresponding to 'PAI' = -1,
       -2, and -3.   Before and after each group of lines is generated, the routine CPCHCL is  called;  a  user-
       supplied version of this routine may override the settings of color, dash pattern, and line width.  Also,
       of  course,  the  routine  RTPL,  which  actually  does  the  drawing, may override the settings of these
       quantities.

       You can use the dash-pattern-usage parameter ('DPU') to affect the pattern used to draw the  lines.   Set
       the value of 'DPU' as follows:

       Value       Description

       &lt; 0 or = 0  Lines  are  drawn  by  calling  the  SPPS  routine CURVE.  Lines are all solid and unlabeled;
                   specified dash patterns are not used.

       &gt; 0         Lines are drawn by calling the Dashline routine CURVED.  Lines are solid or dashed, depending
                   on the dash pattern specified by the appropriate element of 'CLD'.

                   If ABS('LLP') = 1, then the  dash  pattern  for  those  lines  that  are  to  be  labeled  is
                   constructed  by  replicating,  'DPU'  times,  the  dash  pattern specified by the appropriate
                   element of 'CLD', and then appending to  it  the  characters  specified  by  the  appropriate
                   element of 'LLT'.

       If,  during  the  last  call  to  CPRECT,  CPSPS1,  or  CPSPS2, the data being contoured were found to be
       essentially constant, then no contour lines are generated; instead, the constant-field label is  written.
       Other lines are still generated.
