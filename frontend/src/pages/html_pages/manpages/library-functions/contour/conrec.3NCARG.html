</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CONREC - draws a two dimensional contour map from data stored in a rectangular array.  The contour lines
       are labeled.

</pre><h4><b>UTILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This routine is part of the conrec utility in NCAR Graphics. To see the overview man page for this
       utility, type "man conrec_family".

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       CONREC is obsolete.  It has been superseded by the contouring package, Conpack.  See the Conpack entry
       CPCNRC for a simple CONREC replacement.  For more complex examples refer to the conpack and
       conpack_params man pages as well as the NCAR Graphics Contouring and Mapping Tutorial.

       CONREC continues to be provided for compatibility of early NCAR Graphics codes.  If you are writing new
       code, we suggest that you use the more general and rigorous Conpack contouring package.  All CONREC
       options can be duplicated by the proper selection of Conpack parameters.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL CONREC(Z,L,M,N,FLO,HI,FINC,NSET,NHI,NDOT) - draws a contour map using options specified as input
       arguments.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Z           (an  input array of type REAL) defining a two-dimensional field to be contoured.  A subset of
                   Z of extent M by N can be contoured.

       L           (an input parameter of type INTEGER) which is the first dimension of the Z array.

       M           (an input parameter of type INTEGER) which is the extent of the first dimension of array Z to
                   be contoured.  This allows for a sub-array of Z to be contoured.  M  must  be  less  than  or
                   equal to L.

       N           (an  input  parameter of type INTEGER) which is the extent of the second dimension of array Z
                   to be contoured.  This allows for a sub-array of Z to be contoured.  N must be less  than  or
                   equal to the second dimension of Z.

       FLO         (an  input parameter of type REAL) defining a lowest level for contouring.  If FLO = HI = 0.,
                   a value rounded up from the minimum value of Z will be generated by CONREC.

       HI          (an input parameter of type REAL) defining a highest level for contouring.  If HI = FLO = 0.,
                   a value rounded down from the maximum value of Z will be generated by CONREC.

       FINC        (an input parameter of type REAL) which defines how the contour levels are to be selected.

                   &gt; 0., use this value for the increment between contour levels.  There will  be  (HI-FLO)/FINC
                   contour lines generated.

                   = 0., causes CONREC to generate a value which will result in between 10 and 30 contours.

                   &lt; 0., the number of contour levels is the integer absolute value of this number (FINC.)

       NSET        (an input parameter of type INTEGER) which controls plot scaling according to:

                   =  0,  CONREC  automatically  sets  the  window  and viewport sizes.  The viewport becomes by
                   default .05 to .95 in the larger dimension (M or N), and .05  to  a  proportionately  smaller
                   number  in the smaller dimension.  The window becomes 1. to FLOAT(M) in X, and 1. to FLOAT(N)
                   in Y.  The PERIM entry of the Gridall utility is called to generate a plot boundary with tick
                   marks placed at the data grid points.

                   &gt; 0, CONREC assumes the window and viewport have been set by the user.  No plot  boundary  is
                   drawn.

                   &lt;  0, CONREC uses the existing viewport and sets the window to 1. to FLOAT(M) in X, and 1. to
                   FLOAT(N) in Y.  No plot boundary is drawn.

       NHI         (an input parameter of type INTEGER) which controls the printing of extra information on  the
                   plot.

                   =  0, Symbols H and L are written where highs and lows occur and the value of the high or low
                   is written under the symbol.

                   &gt; 0, The Z data values are printed, centered at each grid point.

                   &lt; 0, Neither of the above is done.

       NDOT        (an input parameter of type INTEGER) which specifies the line patterns to be used in  drawing
                   the  contours.  Only the last 10 binary bits of NDOT are used in creating a binary pattern is
                   which 0's are no-line and 1's are line segments. If the absolute value of NDOT is  0,  1,  or
                   1023 a solid line is drawn.  1023 in decimal converts to 1777 octal, or 1111111111 in binary.

                   &gt; 0, The NDOT pattern is used to draw all contours.

                   &lt;  0,  The  absolute  value  of NDOT is used for negative-valued contours and solid lines are
                   drawn for positive contours.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the relevant examples tconre, tcnqck, tcnsmt, and tcnsup.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       CONREC can be invoked in four  different  ways  to  create  contour  plots  which  vary  considerably  in
       appearance.   The  four  variations  include  quick,  normal,  smooth,  and  super  contour  lines.  This
       progression represents a tradeoff between speed of computation and the appearance of the  contour  plots.
       These variations are specified through selected command line options of the ncargf77 command.

       To  use CONREC, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in that order.
       Other optional libraries to create the quick, smooth, and super contours will automatically be linked  by
       the  ncargf77  command.  To run a code called mycode.f which has one or more calls to entry CONREC, issue
       one of the commands:

       NORMAL    Command:  "ncargf77 mycode.f"

                 The contours will be drawn as unsmoothed dashed or solid  lines  that  can  include  characters
                 along the lines.

       QUICK     Command:  "ncargf77 -quick mycode.f"

                 The  contours  will  be  drawn as unsmoothed dashed or solid lines without characters along the
                 lines.  The QUICK drawing algorithm is faster and cruder than  that  used  for  NORMAL  contour
                 lines.   QUICK  uses  a  cell-by-cell  analysis  rather  than  following  each  contour line to
                 completion in sequence as is done in the NORMAL algorithm.

       SMOOTH    Command:  "ncargf77 -smooth mycode.f"

                 The contours will be drawn as smoothed dashed or  solid  lines  using  splines  under  tension.
                 There may be characters along the lines.

       SUPER     Command:  "ncargf77 -super mycode.f"

                 The  contours  will  be  drawn  as  smoothed dashed or solid lines using splines under tension.
                 There may be characters along the lines.  Crowded lines can be thinned.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       When error conditions are detected, the support routine SETER is called in such a way that  it  writes  a
       message  to the standard error file (as defined by <a href="../man4/I1MACH.4.html">I1MACH</a>(4)) and then terminates execution. The possible
       error messages are as follows:

       CONREC  - DIMENSION ERROR - M*N .GT. (2**IARTH)
       The array to be contoured is dimensioned M by N.  This is larger than the address space on this  computer
       (2**IARTH) where IARTH is the size of an address integer.  Check your dimension sizes.
