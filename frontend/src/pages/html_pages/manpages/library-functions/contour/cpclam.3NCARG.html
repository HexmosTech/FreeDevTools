</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPCLAM - Adds contour lines to an area map. This is part of the process of drawing a solid-fill contour
       plot.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL CPCLAM (ZDAT, RWRK, IWRK, IAMA)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_cpclam (float *zdat, float *rwrk, int *iwrk,
       int *iama)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The first three arguments are arrays used in the last call to CPRECT, CPSPS1, or CPSPS2, the contents of
       which must not have been changed since that call.

       ZDAT        (REAL  array,  dimensioned as specified in the last call to CPRECT, CPSPS1, or CPSPS2, input)
                   is the data array.

       RWRK        (REAL array, dimensioned as specified  in  the  last  call  to  CPRECT,  CPSPS1,  or  CPSPS2,
                   input/output) is the real workspace array.

       IWRK        (INTEGER  array,  dimensioned  as  specified  in  the last call to CPRECT, CPSPS1, or CPSPS2,
                   input/output) is the integer workspace array.

       IAMA        (INTEGER array, dimensioned as specified in a call to ARINAM, in the package  Areas)  is  the
                   array containing the area map to which contour lines are to be added.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The routine CPCLAM, which adds contour lines generated from the data in the array ZDAT to the area map in
       the array IAMA, may be called at any time after the initialization call to CPRECT, CPSPS1, or CPSPS2. The
       area map must previously have been initialized by a call to the routine ARINAM in the utility Areas.

       The  contour  lines  added  to the area map are as specified by the first 'NCL' elements of the parameter
       arrays 'CLV', 'AIA', and 'AIB'. If 'NCL' is zero, CPPKCL is called to generate these values.

       The contour levels defined by the first 'NCL' elements of the parameter array 'CLV' are examined.   If  a
       given  contour  level is associated with a non-zero value of 'AIA' and/or a non-zero value of 'AIB', then
       contour lines at that contour level are added to the area map.  If there is an associated non-zero  value
       of 'AIA', it is used as the area identifier for the area "above" the line (where field values are greater
       than  they  are  along the line); otherwise, a zero is used.  If there is an associated non-zero value of
       'AIB', it is used as the area identifier for the area "below" the line (where field values are less  than
       they are along the line); otherwise, a zero is used.  Note that a given contour level may occur more than
       once  in the internal parameter array 'CLV', but there must be at most one non-zero value of 'AIA' and at
       most one non-zero value of 'AIB' associated with it; otherwise, an error exit occurs.

       If the parameter 'T2D' has a non-zero value, the contour lines are smoothed, using  cubic  splines  under
       tension.

       Four  other  types of lines are added to the area map by CPCLAM: (1) the edge of the current viewport and
       possibly a set of vertical lines within the viewport, (2) the edge of the grid, (3) the edges of special-
       value areas, if any, and (4) the edges of out-of-range areas, if any. The area identifier for the outside
       of the viewport is always -1. You can use elements of the parameter array 'AIA' for 'PAI' = -1,  -2,  and
       -3  to specify the area identifiers to be used for the outside of the grid, the inside of a special-value
       area, and the inside of an out-of-range area, respectively; the default values of  all  three  are  -1's.
       Area  identifiers  for all other sides of these edges are determined from the area-identifier information
       given for the contour levels.

       Lines are added to the area map in the following order:

       •  the edge of the viewport and the vertical lines within it,

       •  the edges of the out-of-range areas, if any,

       •  the edge of the grid,

       •  the edges of the special-value areas, if any, and,

       •  the contour lines, in order of increasing contour level.

       The edge of the viewport may actually be added to the area map twice:

       •  as part of the edge group with group identifier 'GIC', and

       •  as part of the edge group with group identifier 'GIS'.

       Vertical lines, if any, are added with group identifier 'GIS'.

       The object of the edge group with group identifier 'GIS' is to break up the areas represented by the area
       map into smaller pieces. Whether this is done or not is under your control,  by  means  of  the  internal
       parameters  'NVS'  and 'GIS'.  For more information, see the descriptions of those internal parameters in
       the conpack_params man page.

       If, during the last call to CPRECT, CPSPS1  or  CPSPS2,  the  data  being  contoured  were  found  to  be
       essentially  constant,  then  no  contour  lines  are  added  to the area map; the other lines are added,
       however.
