       SOAP::WSDL::Manual::Glossary - Those acronyms and stuff

</pre><h4><b>Glossary</b></h4><pre>
   <b>web</b> <b>service</b>
       Web services are RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interfaces accessible via some internet protocol, typically
       via HTTP(S).

   <b>SOAP</b>
       SOAP is (was - since 1.2 the name "SOAP" has no meaning any more) an acronym for Simple Object Access
       Protocol.  SOAP is a W3C recommendation. The latest version of the SOAP specification may be found at
       &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/">http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/</a>&gt;.

       SOAP defines a protocol for message exchange between applications.  The most popular usage is to use SOAP
       for remote procedure calls (RPC).

       While one of the constituting aspects of a web service is its reachability via some internet protocol,
       you might as well define SOAP services accessible via postcards.

       Despite it's former name, SOAP has nothing more to do with objects than cars have with pets - SOAP
       messages may, but not necessarily do carry objects, very much like your car may, but does not need to
       carry your pet.

   <b>WSDL</b>
       WSDL is an acronym for Web Services Description Language.  WSDL is a W3C recommendation. The latest
       version of the WSDL specification may be found at &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl20/">http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl20/</a>&gt;.

       WSDL defines a XML-based language for describing web service interfaces, including SOAP interfaces.

   <b>WS-I</b>
       WS-I (Web Services Interoperability Organization) is an open industry organisation chartered to promote
       Web service interoperability across platforms, operating systems, and programming languages.

       WS-I publishes profiles, which provide implementation guidelines for how related Web services
       specifications should be used together for best interoperability. To date, WS-I has finalized the Basic
       Profile, Attachments Profile and Simple SOAP Binding Profile.

       SOAP::WSDL aims at complying to the WS-I Basic Profile (but does not implement full support yet).

   <b>SOAP</b> <b>message</b> <b>styles</b>
       <u>rpc</u>

       Meant for transporting a RPC message. All contents of the SOAP body are put into a top-level node named
       equal to the SOAP operation.

       WS-I Basic Profile allows the use of rpc message style.

       SOAP::WSDL does not support rpc message style yet.

       SOAP::Lite supports rpc message style only.

       <u>document</u>

       Meant for transporting arbitrary content. No additional nodes are inserted between the SOAP body and the
       actual content.

       WS-I Basic Profile allows the use of document message style.

   <b>SOAP</b> <b>encoding</b> <b>styles</b>
       <u>encoded</u>

       <u>literal</u>
