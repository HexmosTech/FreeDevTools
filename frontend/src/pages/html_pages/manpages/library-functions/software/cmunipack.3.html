</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cmunipack - CCD astrophotometry software package

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  software  package C-Munipack presents the complete system for reduction of images carried out by CCD
       camera, oriented at the observation of variable stars. The specific programs of reduction process can  be
       called from command line or via intuitive graphical user interface. For developers a dynamic-link library
       with powerful interface is available.

       The  project  is based on the previous Munipack package, the programs have the same name, but contrary to
       Munipack, it is coded in C language and it contains a  several  new  functions  and  tools  in  addition.
       Assignment  of  the  command-line  parameters  and  the  configuration files is similar in both projects,
       exceptions are described in the project documentation.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The project manager David Motl is also the author of the most part of the source codes.  Some  algorithms
       originates  from  Munipack  package,  coded by Filip Hroch. Algorithms for aperture photometry originates
       from Daophot software by P. B. Stetson. Munifind algorithm originates from Varfind tool written by Rudolf
       Novak and Lukas Kral.

       The package uses the FITSIO library (Dr. William Pence, NASA), and the James ClarkÂ´s EXPAT library.

       The english version of the documentation was written by David Motl with great help  of  Petr  Lutcha  and
       Jitka Kudrnacova.
