</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Weasel::DriverRole - API definition for driver wrappers

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       0.04

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Moose;
         use Weasel::DriverRole;

         with 'Weasel::DriverRole';

         ...  # (re)implement the functions in Weasel::DriverRole

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module defines the API for all Weasel drivers to be implemented.

       By using this role in the driver implementation module, an abstract method is implemented <b>croak()</b>ing if
       it's called.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       started
           Every  session  is  associated  with a driver instance. The "started" attribute holds a boolean value
           indicating whether or not the driver is ready to receive driver commands.

           The value managed by the "start" and "stop" methods.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES/METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       implements
           This method returns the version number of the API which it fully implements.

           Weasel::Session may carp (warn) the user about mismatching API levels  in  case  a  driver  is  coded
           against an earlier version than $Weasel::DriverRole::VERSION.

       start
           This  method  allows  setup of the driver. It is invoked before any web driver methods as per the Web
           driver methods section below.

       stop
           This method allows tear-down of the driver. After tear-down, the "start" method may be called  again,
           so the this function should leave the driver in a restartable state.

       restart
           This function stops (if started) and starts the driver.

   <b>Web</b> <b>driver</b> <b>methods</b>
       <u>Terms</u>

       element_id / parent_id
           These are opaque values used by the driver to identify DOM elements.

           Note: The driver should always accept an xpath locator as an id value
             as well as id values returned from earlier driver calls

       <u>API</u>

       find_all( $parent_id, $locator, $scheme )
           Returns the _id values for the elements to be instantiated, matching the $locator using "scheme".

           Depending on array or scalar context, the return value is a list or an arrayref.

           Note:  there's  no  function  to  find  a  single  element.  That  function  is  implemented  on  the
           "Weasel::Session" level.

       get( $url )
           Loads the page at $url into the driver's browser (browser emulator).

           The $url passed in has been expanded by "Weasel::Session", prepending a registered prefix.

       is_displayed($element_id)
           Returns a boolean value indicating whether the element indicated by $element_id is interactable  (can
           be selected, clicked on, etc)

       wait_for( $callback, retry_timeout =&gt; $num, poll_delay =&gt; $num, on_timeout =&gt; \&amp;cb )
           The driver may interpret the 'poll_delay' in one of two ways:
            1. The 'poll_delay' equals the number of seconds between the start of
               successive poll requests
            2. The 'poll_delay' equals the number of seconds to wait between the end
               of one poll request and the start of the next

           <u>Since</u>  <u>0.03:</u>  Unless  an "on_timeout" callback is provided, will "die" when the timeout has exceeded.
           Otherwise, call the provided callback.

           Note: The user should catch inside the callback any exceptions that are
             thrown inside the callback, unless such exceptions are allowed to
             terminate further polling attempts.
             I.e. this function doesn't guard against early termination by
             catching exceptions.

       clear($element_id)
           Clicks on an element if an element id is provided, or on the current mouse location otherwise.

       click( [ $element_id ] )
           Clicks on an element if an element id is provided, or on the current mouse location otherwise.

       <b>dblclick()</b>
           Double clicks on the current mouse location.

       get_attribute($element_id, $attribute_name)
           Returns the value of the attribute named by $attribute_name of the element indicated by $element_id.

       get_page_source($fh)
           Writes a get_page_source of the browser's window to the filehandle $fh.

       get_text($element_id)
           Returns the HTML content of the element identified by $element_id, the so-called 'innerHTML'.

       set_attribute($element_id, $attribute_name, $value)
           DEPRECATED

           Changes the value of the attribute named by $attribute_name to $value for the element  identified  by
           $element_id.

       get_selected($element_id)
           DEPRECATED

           Please use "$self-"get_attribute('selected')&gt; instead.

       set_selected($element_id, $value)
           DEPRECATED

           Please use "$self-"set_attribute('selected', $value)&gt; instead.

       screenshot($fh)
           Takes a screenshot and writes the image to the file handle $fh.

           Note: In the current version of the driver, it's assumed the
             driver writes a PNG image. Later versions may add APIs to
             get/set the type of image generated.

       send_keys($element_id, @keys)
           Simulates key input into the element identified by $element_id.

           @keys  is  an  array  of  (groups of) inputs; multiple multi-character strings may be listed. In such
           cases the input will be appended. E.g.

             $driver-&gt;send_keys($element_id, "hello", ' ', "world");

           is valid input to enter the text "hello world" into $element_id.

           Note: Special keys are encoded according to the WebDriver spec.
            In case a driver implementation needs differentt encoding of
            special keys, this function should recode from the values
            found in <b>WebDriver::KEYS()</b> to the desired code-set

       tag_name($element_id)
           The name of the HTML tag identified by $element_id.
