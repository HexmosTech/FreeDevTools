</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Duo::Auth - Perl interface for the Duo Auth API

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $duo = Net::Duo::Auth-&gt;new({ key_file =&gt; '/path/to/keys.json' });
           my $timestamp = $duo-&gt;check;

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.14 or later and the modules HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response (part of HTTP::Message), JSON, LWP
       (also known as libwww-perl), Perl6::Slurp, Sub::Install, and URI::Escape (part of URI), all of which are
       available from CPAN.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Duo::Auth is an implementation of the Duo Auth REST API for Perl.  Method calls correspond to
       endpoints in the REST API.  Its goal is to provide a native, natural interface for all Duo operations in
       the API from inside Perl, while abstracting away as many details of the API as can be reasonably handled
       automatically.

       Currently, only a tiny number of available methods are implemented.

       For calls that return complex data structures, the return from the call will generally be an object in
       the Net::Duo::Auth namespace.  These objects all have methods matching the name of the field in the Duo
       API documentation that returns that field value.  Where it makes sense, there will also be a method with
       the same name but with "set_" prepended that changes that value.  No changes are made to the Duo record
       itself until the <b>commit()</b> method is called on the object, which will make the underlying Duo API call to
       update the data.

       On failure, all methods throw a Net::Duo::Exception object.  This can be interpolated into a string for a
       simple error message, or inspected with method calls for more details.  This is also true of all methods
       in all objects in the Net::Duo namespace.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new(ARGS)
           Create  a  new  Net::Duo::Auth  object,  which is used for all subsequent calls.  This constructor is
           inherited from Net::Duo.  See Net::Duo for documentation of the possible arguments.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       auth(ARGS)
           Perform a Duo synchronous authentication.

           The user will be authenticated given the factor and additional information  provided  in  ARGS.   The
           call  will not return until the user has authenticated or the call has failed for some reason.  To do
           long-polling instead, see <b>auth_async()</b>.

           ARGS should be a reference to a hash.  The following keys may always be present:

           user_id
               The Duo ID of the user to authenticate.  Either this or "username", but only one  or  the  other,
               must be specified.

           username
               The  username of the user to authenticate.  Either this or "username", but only one or the other,
               must be specified.

           factor
               The authentication factor to use, chosen from "push", "passcode", or "phone", or  "auto"  to  use
               whichever of "push" or "phone" appears best for this user's devices according to Duo.  Required.

           ipaddr
               The  IP  address of the user, used for logging and to support sending an "allow" response without
               further verification if the  user  is  coming  from  a  trusted  network  as  configured  in  the
               integration.

           Additional keys may be present depending on "factor".  For a "factor" value of "push":

           device
               The ID of the device to which to send the push notification, or "auto" to send to the first push-
               capable device.  Optional, defaulting to "auto".

           type
               This  string  is  displayed  in  the  Duo  Mobile  app before the word "request".  The default is
               "Login", so the phrase "Login request" appears in the push notification text and on  the  request
               details screen.  You may want to specify "Transaction", "Transfer", etc.  Optional.

           display_username
               String to display in Duo Mobile in place of the user's Duo username.  Optional.

           pushinfo
               A  reference  to  a  list  of  additional  key/value  pairs to display to the user as part of the
               authentication request.  For example:

                   { pushinfo =&gt; [from =&gt; 'login portal', domain =&gt; 'example.com'] }

               This is a list rather than a hash so that it preserves the order of arguments, but  there  should
               always be an even number of members in the list.

           For a "factor" value of "passcode":

           passcode
               The passcode to validate.  Required.

           For a "factor" value of "phone":

           phone
               The  ID  of  the  device  to  call,  or  "auto" to call the first available device.  Optional and
               defaults to "auto".

           In a scalar context, this method returns true if the user was successfully authenticated and false if
           authentication failed for any reason.  In a list context, the same status argument is returned as the
           first member of the list, and the second member of the  list  will  be  a  reference  to  a  hash  of
           additional data.  Possible keys are:

           status
               String detailing the progress or outcome of the authentication attempt.

           status_msg
               A  string describing the result of the authentication attempt.  If the authentication attempt was
               denied, it may identify a reason.  This string is intended for display to the user.

           trusted_device_token
               If the trusted devices option is enabled for this account, returns a token for a  trusted  device
               that can later be passed to the Duo "preauth" endpoint.

           If you are looking for the Duo "sms" factor type, use the <b>send_sms_passcodes()</b> method instead.

       auth_async(ARGS)
           Perform a Duo asynchronous authentication.

           An  authentication  attempt will be started for a user according to the information provided in ARGS.
           The return value from this call will be a Net::Duo::Admin::Async object, which  provides  a  <b>status()</b>
           method,  to  get  the  status  of  the  authentication, and an <b>id()</b> method, to recover the underlying
           transaction ID.  This approach allows the application to get the authentication status at each stage,
           instead of receiving no information until the authentication has succeeded or failed.

           ARGS should be a reference to a hash with the same parameters as  were  specified  for  the  "<b>auth()</b>"
           method.

       <b>check()</b>
           Calls  the  Duo  "check"  endpoint.   This  can be used as a simple check that all of the integration
           arguments are correct and the client can authenticate to the Duo authentication API.  On success,  it
           returns the current time on the Duo server in seconds since UNIX epoch.

       send_sms_passcodes(USERNAME[, DEVICE])
           Send  a new batch of passcodes to the specified user via SMS.  By default, the passcodes will be sent
           to the first SMS-capable device (the Duo "auto" behavior).  The optional second argument specifies  a
           device ID to which to send the passcodes.  Any failure will result in an exception.
