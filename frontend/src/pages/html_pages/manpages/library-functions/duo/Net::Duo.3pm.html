</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Duo - API for Duo multifactor authentication service

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $duo = Net::Duo-&gt;new({ key_file =&gt; '/path/to/keys.json' });
           my $reply = $duo-&gt;call_json('GET', '/auth/v2/check');

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.14 or later and the modules HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response (part of HTTP::Message), JSON, LWP
       (also known as libwww-perl), Perl6::Slurp, and URI::Escape (part of URI), all of which are available from
       CPAN.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Duo provides an object-oriented Perl interface for generic calls to one of the the Duo Security REST
       APIs.  This module is intended primarily for use as a base class for more specialized Perl modules
       implementing the specific Duo APIs, but it can also be used directly to make generic API calls.

       On failure, all methods throw a Net::Duo::Exception object.  This can be interpolated into a string for a
       simple error message, or inspected with method calls for more details.  This is also true of all methods
       in all objects in the Net::Duo namespace.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new(ARGS)
           Create  a  new  Net::Duo object.  This should be used for all subsequent API calls.  ARGS should be a
           hash reference with one or more of the following keys:

           api_hostname
               The API hostname returned by Duo when the API integration was created.

               This key is required if "key_file" is not set.

           integration_key
               The integration key returned by Duo when the API integration was created.   This  is  effectively
               the public "username" for this integration.

               This key is required if "key_file" is not set.

           key_file
               The  path to a file in JSON format that contains the key and hostname data for a Duo integration.
               This file  should  contain  one  JSON  object  with  keys  "integration_key",  "secret_key",  and
               "api_hostname".  These are the three data values that are returned when one creates a new Duo API
               integration.

               Be aware that the "secret_key" value in this file is security-sensitive information equivalent to
               a  password.   Anyone  in  possession of that key has complete control of all data and actions to
               which the integration has access.

               Either this key or all of "integration_key", "secret_key", and "api_hostname" must  be  provided.
               If  both  this  key  and  some  of those keys are provided, their values will override the values
               retrieved from the "key_file" file.

           secret_key
               The secret key returned by Duo when the API integration was created.  This is  security-sensitive
               information  equivalent  to a password.  Anyone in possession of that key has complete control of
               all data and actions to which the integration has access.  Do not hard-code this  into  programs;
               instead,  read  it  from a file with appropriate permissions or retrieve it via some other secure
               mechanism.

               This key is required if "key_file" is not set.

           user_agent
               The user agent to use for all requests.  This should be a Perl object that supports the same  API
               as LWP::UserAgent.

               Normally,  the  caller  will  not  provide  this  key,  in  which  case  Net::Duo  will create an
               LWP::UserAgent object internally to use to  make  Duo  API  calls.   This  argument  is  provided
               primarily so that the user agent can be overridden for unit testing.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       call(METHOD, PATH[, ARGS])
           Make a generic Duo API call, with no assumptions about the response.

           This  is  a  low-level  escape  hatch  to make any Duo API call that this module does not know about,
           regardless of what format in which it returns its results.  The caller will have to  provide  all  of
           the  details  (HTTP method, URL path, and all arguments as a reference to a hash of key/value pairs).
           The URL path must start with a slash.

           The return value is the resulting HTTP::Response object from the web API  call.   No  error  checking
           will  be  performed.   The  caller  is  responsible  for  examining the HTTP::Response object for any
           problems, including internal or HTTP errors.

           Most Duo API calls return structured JSON and follow a standard pattern for indicating  errors.   For
           those  calls, use <b>call_json()</b> instead of this method.  <b>call()</b> is needed only for the small handful of
           API calls that do not return JSON in that format, such as the Auth API "/logo" endpoint.

       call_json(METHOD, PATH[, ARGS])
           Make a generic Duo API call that returns a JSON response.

           This is the escape hatch to use to make any Duo API call that this module does not know  about.   The
           caller  will  have  to  provide  all  of  the  details (HTTP method, URL path, and all arguments as a
           reference to a hash of key/value pairs).  The URL path must start with a slash.

           The return value will be only the value of the response key from  the  returned  JSON.   This  method
           still  handles  checking  the "stat" value from Duo and throwing a Net::Duo::Exception object on call
           failure.

           This method cannot be used with the small handful of API calls that do not return JSON, such  as  the
           Auth API "/logo" endpoint.

       call_json_paged(METHOD, PATH[, ARGS])
           The same as <b>call_json()</b>, except for endpoints that require pagination.  This will make repeated calls
           to  <b>call_json()</b>  with  increasing  offsets until it has retrieved all of the objects, and then return
           them all as a single response.  It always uses a "limit" setting of 500.
