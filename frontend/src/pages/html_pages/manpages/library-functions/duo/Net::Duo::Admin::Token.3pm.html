</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Duo::Admin::Token - Representation of a Duo token

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $decoded_json = get_json();
           my $token = Net::Duo::Admin::Token-&gt;new($decoded_json);
           say $token-&gt;serial;

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.14 or later and the modules HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response (part of HTTP::Message), JSON, LWP
       (also known as libwww-perl), Perl6::Slurp, Sub::Install, and URI::Escape (part of URI), all of which are
       available from CPAN.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A Net::Duo::Admin::Token object is a Perl representation of a Duo token as returned by the Duo Admin API,
       usually via the <b>tokens()</b> method or nested in a user returned by the <b>users()</b> method.  It contains various
       information about a token.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       create(DUO, DATA)
           Creates  a  new  token in Duo and returns the resulting token as a new Net::Duo::Admin::Token object.
           DUO is the Net::Duo object that should be used to perform the creation.  DATA is  a  reference  to  a
           hash with the following keys:

           aes_key
               The YubiKey AES key.  This parameter is required for YubiKey hardware tokens.

           counter
               Initial  value  for the HOTP counter.  The default is 0.  This parameter is only valid for HOTP-6
               and HOTP-8 hardware tokens.

           private_id
               The YubiKey private ID.  This parameter is required for YubiKey hardware tokens.

           secret
               The HOTP secret.  This parameter is required for HOTP-6 and HOTP-8 hardware tokens.

           serial
               The serial number of the token.  Required.

           type
               The type of hardware token.  For the list of valid values, see the Duo Admin  API  documentation.
               Required.

           Note that several of these keys can only be set on token creation and cannot be retrieved afterwards.

       new(DUO, DATA)
           Creates  a  new  Net::Duo::Admin::Token object from a full data set.  DUO is the Net::Duo object that
           should be used for any further actions on this object.  DATA should be the data structure returned by
           the Duo REST API for a single user, after JSON decoding.

       new(DUO, ID)
           Creates a new Net::Duo::Admin::Token by ID.  DUO is the Net::Duo object that is used to retrieve  the
           token  from  Duo and will be used for any subsequent operations.  The ID should be the Duo identifier
           of the token.  This constructor is distinguished from the previous constructor by checking whether ID
           is a reference.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>ACTION</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>delete()</b>
           Delete this token from Duo.  After successful completion of  this  call,  the  Net::Duo::Admin::Token
           object  should  be  considered  read-only, since no further changes to the object can be meaningfully
           sent to Duo.

       <b>json()</b>
           Convert the data stored in the object to JSON and return the  results.   The  resulting  JSON  should
           match the JSON that one would get back from the Duo web service when retrieving the same object (plus
           any  changes  made  locally  to  the  object  via  set_*()  methods).  This is primarily intended for
           debugging dumps or for passing Duo objects to other systems via further JSON APIs.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>serial()</b>
           The serial number of the hardware token, used to uniquely identify the  hardware  token  when  paired
           with <b>type()</b>.

                   serial   =&gt; 'simple',
                   token_id =&gt; 'simple',
                   type     =&gt; 'simple',
                   users    =&gt; 'Net::Duo::Admin::User',

       <b>token_id()</b>
           The unique ID of this token as generated by Duo on token creation.

       <b>type()</b>
           The type of token.  For the list of valid values, see the Duo Admin API documentation.

       <b>users()</b>
           The users associated with this token as a list of Net::Duo::Admin::User objects.
