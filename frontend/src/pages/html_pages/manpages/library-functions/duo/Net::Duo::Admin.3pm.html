</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Duo::Admin - Perl interface for the Duo Admin API

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $duo = Net::Duo::Admin-&gt;new({ key_file =&gt; '/path/to/keys.json' });
           my @users = $duo-&gt;users;

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.14 or later and the modules HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response (part of HTTP::Message), JSON, LWP
       (also known as libwww-perl), Perl6::Slurp, Sub::Install, and URI::Escape (part of URI), all of which are
       available from CPAN.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Duo::Admin is an implementation of the Duo Admin REST API for Perl.  Method calls correspond to
       endpoints in the REST API.  Its goal is to provide a native, natural interface for all Duo operations in
       the API from inside Perl, while abstracting away as many details of the API as can be reasonably handled
       automatically.

       Currently, only a tiny number of available methods are implemented.

       For calls that return complex data structures, the return from the call will generally be an object in
       the Net::Duo::Admin namespace.  These objects all have methods matching the name of the field in the Duo
       API documentation that returns that field value.  Where it makes sense, there will also be a method with
       the same name but with "set_" prepended that changes that value.  No changes are made to the Duo record
       itself until the <b>commit()</b> method is called on the object, which will make the underlying Duo API call to
       update the data.

       Some objects have associated lists of other objects.  For example, a user has a list of phones and a list
       of tokens.  Wherever this pattern occurs, new objects can be added to that list with a method starting
       with "add_" and removed with a method starting with "remove_".  These changes are pushed to Duo
       immediately and do not wait for the next <b>commit()</b>.

       On failure, all methods throw a Net::Duo::Exception object.  This can be interpolated into a string for a
       simple error message, or inspected with method calls for more details.  This is also true of all methods
       in all objects in the Net::Duo namespace.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new(ARGS)
           Create  a  new  Net::Duo::Admin  object, which is used for all subsequent calls.  This constructor is
           inherited from Net::Duo.  See Net::Duo for documentation of the possible arguments.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>integrations()</b>
           Retrieves all the integrations currently present in this Duo account and returns them as  a  list  of
           Net::Duo::Admin::Integration  objects.   Be aware that this list may be quite long if the Duo account
           supports many integrations, and the entire list is read into memory.

       logs_administrator([MINTIME])
           Returns a list of administrative actions.  Each member of this list will be a  reference  to  a  hash
           with the following keys:

           timestamp
               The time of the event in seconds since UNIX epoch.

           username
               The username of the administrator, or "API" if the action was performed via the Admin API.

           action
               The administrator action.  See the Duo Admin API documentation for a full list of valid values.

           object
               An  identifier for the object that was acted on.  What fields are used as an identifier will vary
               by type of object.

           description
               The details of what was changed.

           At most 1,000 log entries will be returned.  If MINTIME is provided, only records with a  time  stamp
           after  MINTIME  will  be  returned.   All  records  can therefore be retrieved by calling this method
           repeatedly, first with no MINTIME and then with MINTIME matching the timestamp of the  last  returned
           record from the previous call.

       logs_authentication([MINTIME])
           Returns  a  list  of  authentication attempts.  Each member of the list will be a reference to a hash
           with the following keys:

           timestamp
               The time of the event in seconds since UNIX epoch.

           username
               The authenticating user's username.

           factor
               The authentication factor, chosen from "phone call", "passcode", "bypass code",  "sms  passcode",
               "sms refresh", or "duo push".

           result
               The result of the authentication, chosen from "success", "failure", "error", or "fraud".

           ip  The IP address from which the authentication attempt originated.

           integration
               The name of the integration from which the authentication attempt originated.

           At most 1,000 authentication log entries will be returned.  If MINTIME is provided, only records with
           a  time stamp after MINTIME will be returned.  All records can therefore be retrieved by calling this
           method repeatedly, first with no MINTIME and then with MINTIME matching the  timestamp  of  the  last
           returned record from the previous call.

       logs_telephony([MINTIME])
           Returns  a list of telephony events.  Each member of this list will be a reference to a hash with the
           following keys:

           timestamp
               The time of the event in seconds since UNIX epoch.

           context
               How  this  telephony  event  was  initiated.   This  will  be  one  of   "administrator   login",
               "authentication", "enrollment", or "verify".

           type
               The event type.  One of "sms" or "phone".

           phone
               The phone number that initiated this event.

           credits
               How many telephony credits this event cost.

           At  most  1,000 log entries will be returned.  If MINTIME is provided, only records with a time stamp
           after MINTIME will be returned.  All records can  therefore  be  retrieved  by  calling  this  method
           repeatedly,  first  with no MINTIME and then with MINTIME matching the timestamp of the last returned
           record from the previous call.

       user(USERNAME)
           Retrieves a single user by username and returns it as a Net::Duo::Admin::User object if found.  If no
           user with that username exists, returns undef, and does not throw an exception.

       <b>users()</b>
           Retrieves all the users currently present in  this  Duo  account  and  returns  them  as  a  list  of
           Net::Duo::Admin::User  objects.   Be  aware  that  this  list  may be quite long and consume a lot of
           resources for accounts with many users.
