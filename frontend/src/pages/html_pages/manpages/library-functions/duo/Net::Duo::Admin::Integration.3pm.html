</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Duo::Admin::Integration - Representation of a Duo integration

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $decoded_json = get_json();
           my $integration = Net::Duo::Admin::Integration-&gt;new($decoded_json);
           say $integration-&gt;secret_key;

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.14 or later and the modules HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response (part of HTTP::Message), JSON, LWP
       (also known as libwww-perl), Perl6::Slurp, Sub::Install, and URI::Escape (part of URI), all of which are
       available from CPAN.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An integration is Duo's name for the metadata for a system or service that is allowed to use one or more
       of the Duo APIs.  This object is the Perl representation of a Duo integration as returned by the Duo
       Admin API, usually via the <b>integrations()</b> method of Net::Duo::Admin or by retrieving an integration by
       integration key.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       create(DUO, DATA)
           Creates   a   new   integration   in   Duo   and   returns   the   resulting  integration  as  a  new
           Net::Duo::Admin::Integration object.  DUO is the Net::Duo object that should be used to  perform  the
           creation.   DATA  is  a  reference  to  a hash with one or more of the following keys (the "name" and
           "type" keys are required):

           adminapi_admins
               Only valid for integrations of type "adminapi".  Set to a true value to grant permission  to  use
               all Admin API methods.  Optional and defaults to false.

           adminapis_info
               Only  valid  for integrations of type "adminapi".  Set to a true value to grant permission to use
               all Admin API account info methods.  Optional and defaults to false.

           adminapis_integrations
               Only valid for integrations of type "adminapi".  Set to a true value to grant permission  to  use
               all Admin API integration methods.  Optional and defaults to false.

           adminapis_read_log
               Only  valid  for integrations of type "adminapi".  Set to a true value to grant permission to use
               all Admin API log methods.  Optional and defaults to false.

           adminapis_read_resource
               Only valid for integrations of type "adminapi".  Set to a true value to grant permission  to  use
               all  Admin API methods that retrieve objects such as users, phones, and hardware tokens.  Setting
               this key does not grant permission to change those objects or  create  new  ones.   Optional  and
               defaults to false.

           adminapis_settings
               Only  valid  for integrations of type "adminapi".  Set to a true value to grant permission to use
               all Admin API settings methods.  These control  global  settings  for  the  entire  Duo  account.
               Optional and defaults to false.

           adminapis_write_resource
               Only  valid  for integrations of type "adminapi".  Set to a true value to grant permission to use
               all Admin API methods that create or modify objects  such  as  as  users,  phones,  and  hardware
               tokens.  Optional and defaults to false.

           enroll_policy
               What  to  do  after  an  enrolled  user passes primary authentication.  See the "<b>enroll_policy()</b>"
               method below for the possible values.  Optional and defaults to "enroll".

           greeting
               Voice greeting read before the authentication instructions to users who authenticate with a phone
               callback.  Optional.

           groups_allowed
               A comma-separated list of group IDs that  are  allowed  to  authenticate  with  the  integration.
               Optional.  By default, all groups are allowed.

           ip_whitelist
               CSV  string  of  trusted IPs or IP ranges.  Both CIDR-style ranges and ranges specified by two IP
               addresses separated by a dash ("-") are supported.  Authentications from these IP addresses  will
               not require a second factor.

               This  can  only be set for certain integrations.  For the range of valid values and circumstances
               in which this can be used, see the Duo Admin API documentation.  Optional.

           ip_whitelist_enroll_policy
               What to do after a new user  from  a  trusted  IP  completes  primary  authentication.   See  the
               "<b>ip_whitelist_enroll_policy()</b>"  method  below  for the possible values.  Optional and defaults to
               "enforce".

           name
               The name of the integration.  Required.

           notes
               Any further description of the integration.  Optional.

           trusted_device_days
               Number of days to allow a user to trust the device they are logging in with.  This  can  only  be
               set  for  certain integrations and must be between 0 and 60.  (0 disables this feature.)  For the
               circumstances in which this can be used, see the Duo Admin API documentation.  Optional.

           type
               The type of the integration.  For a list of valid values, see the Duo  Admin  API  documentation.
               Required.

           username_normalization_policy
               Controls  whether  or  not  usernames  should  be  altered  before trying to match them to a user
               account.  See  the  "<b>username_normalization_policy()</b>"  method  below  for  the  possible  values.
               Optional and defaults to "simple".

           visual_style
               Look  and  feel  of  web  content generated by the integration.  This can only be set for certain
               integrations.  For a list of valid values and circumstances in which this can be  used,  see  the
               Duo Admin API documentation.  Optional.

       new(DUO, DATA)
           Creates  a  new Net::Duo::Admin::Integration object from a full data set.  DUO is the Net::Duo object
           that should be used for any further actions on this  object.   DATA  should  be  the  data  structure
           returned  by  the Duo REST API for a single user, after JSON decoding.  This constructor is primarily
           used internally by other Net::Duo::Admin methods.

       new(DUO, KEY)
           Creates a new Net::Duo::Admin::Integration object from the integration  key.   DUO  is  the  Net::Duo
           object  that  is  used  to  retrieve  the  integration  from  Duo and will be used for any subsequent
           operations.  The KEY should  be  the  integration  key  of  the  integration.   This  constructor  is
           distinguished from the previous constructor by checking whether KEY is a reference.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>ACTION</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>delete()</b>
           Delete   this   integration   from   Duo.    After   successful   completion   of   this   call,  the
           Net::Duo::Admin::Integration object should be considered read-only, since no further changes  to  the
           object can be meaningfully sent to Duo.

       <b>json()</b>
           Convert  the  data  stored  in  the object to JSON and return the results.  The resulting JSON should
           match the JSON that one would get back from the Duo web service when retrieving the same object (plus
           any changes made locally to the  object  via  set_*()  methods).   This  is  primarily  intended  for
           debugging dumps or for passing Duo objects to other systems via further JSON APIs.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>adminapi_admins()</b>
           Whether this admin integration may use all Admin API methods.

       <b>adminapis_info()</b>
           Whether this admin integration may use all Admin API account info methods.

       <b>adminapis_integrations()</b>
           Whether this admin integration may use all Admin API integration methods.

       <b>adminapis_read_log()</b>
           Whether this admin integration may use all Admin API log methods.

       <b>adminapis_read_resource()</b>
           Whether  this  admin  integration  may use all Admin API methods that retrieve objects such as users,
           phones, and hardware tokens.

       <b>adminapis_settings()</b>
           Whether this admin integration may use all Admin API settings methods.

       <b>adminapis_write_resource()</b>
           Whether this admin integration may use all Admin API methods that create or modify objects such as as
           users, phones, and hardware tokens.

       <b>enroll_policy()</b>
           What to do after an enrolled user passes primary authentication.  The value will be one of  "enroll",
           to  prompt the user to enroll, "allow", to allow the user to sign in without presenting an additional
           factor, and "deny", to deny authentication for this user.

       <b>greeting()</b>
           Voice greeting read before the authentication instructions to users who  authenticate  with  a  phone
           callback.

       <b>groups_allowed()</b>
           A reference to an array of group IDs that are allowed to authenticate with the integration.

       <b>ip_whitelist()</b>
           List  of  trusted  IPs  or  IP  ranges.   Ranges  may be in the form of CIDR network blocks or ranges
           specified by two IP addresses separated by a dash ("-") are supported.  Authentications from these IP
           addresses will not require a second factor.  Example values:

               192.0.2.8
               198.51.100.0-198.51.100.20
               203.0.113.0/24

           This is only supported with certain integration types.

       <b>ip_whitelist_enroll_policy()</b>
           What to do after a new user from a trusted IP completes primary authentication.  The  value  will  be
           either  "enforce",  meaning that the user will be subject to the normal enrollment policy as returned
           by <b>enroll_policy()</b>, or "allow", which means that the user will be successfully authenticated  without
           being required to enroll, skipping any enrollment policy.

       <b>integration_key()</b>
           The   identifier   of   this  integration.   For  "adminapi",  "accountsapi",  "rest",  and  "verify"
           integrations, this is the key used as  the  "integration_key"  value  when  constructing  a  Net::Duo
           object.

       <b>name()</b>
           The name of the integration.

       <b>notes()</b>
           Any further description of the integration.

       <b>secret_key()</b>
           Secret used when configuring systems to use this integration.  For "adminapi", "accountsapi", "rest",
           and  "verify"  integrations,  this  is  the  key  used  as the "secret_key" value when constructing a
           Net::Duo object.  This is equivalent to a password and should be treated with the same care.

       <b>trusted_device_days()</b>
           Number of days to allow a user to trust the device they  are  logging  in  with,  or  0  if  this  is
           disabled.  This setting only has an effect for certain integrations.

       <b>type()</b>
           The type of the integration.  For a list of possible values, see the Duo Admin API documentation.

       <b>username_normalization_policy()</b>
           Controls  whether  or  not usernames should be altered before trying to match them to a user account.
           The value will be either "none", indicating no normalization, or "simple", in which "DOMAIN\username"
           and "<a href="mailto:username@example.com">username@example.com</a>" will be converted to "username" before authentication is attempted.

       <b>visual_style()</b>
           Look and feel of web content generated by  the  integration.   This  only  has  an  effect  for  some
           integrations.  For a list of valid values, see the Duo Admin API documentation.
