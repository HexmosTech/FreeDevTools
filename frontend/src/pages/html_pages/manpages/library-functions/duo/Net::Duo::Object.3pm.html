</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Duo::Object - Helper base class for Duo objects

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package Net::Duo::Admin::Token 1.00;

           use parent qw(Net::Duo::Object);

           sub fields {
               return {
                   token_id =&gt; 'simple',
                   type     =&gt; 'simple',
                   serial   =&gt; 'simple',
                   users    =&gt; 'Net::Duo::Admin::User',
               };
           }

           Net::Duo::Admin::Token-&gt;install_accessors;

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.14 or later and the modules HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response (part of HTTP::Message), JSON, LWP
       (also known as libwww-perl), Perl6::Slurp, Sub::Install, and URI::Escape (part of URI), all of which are
       available from CPAN.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Duo API contains a variety of objects, represented as JSON objects with multiple fields.  This
       objects often embed other objects inside them.  To provide a nice Perl API with getters, setters, and
       commit and delete methods on individual objects, we want to wrap these Duo REST API objects in Perl
       classes.

       This module serves as a base class for such objects and does the dirty work of constructing an object
       from decoded JSON data and building the accessors automatically from a field specification.

       This class should normally be considered an internal implementation detail of the Net::Duo API.  Only
       developers of the Net::Duo modules should need to worry about it.  Callers can use other Net::Duo API
       objects without knowing anything about how this class works.

</pre><h4><b>FIELD</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       Any class that wants to use Net::Duo::Object to construct itself must provide a field specification.
       This is a data structure that describes all the data fields in that object.  It is used by the generic
       Net::Duo::Object constructor to build the Perl data structure for an object, and by the
       <b>install_accessors()</b> class method to create the accessors for the class.

       The client class must provide a class method named <b>_fields()</b> that returns a reference to a hash.  The
       keys of the hash are the field names of the data stored in an object of that class.  The values specify
       the type of data stored in that field.  Each value may be either a simple string or a reference to an
       array, in which case the first value is the type and the remaining values are flags.  The types must be
       chosen from the following:

       "array"
           An array of simple text, number, or boolean values.

       "simple"
           A simple text, number, or boolean field,

       <u>class</u>
           The  name  of  a  class.   This  field should then contain an array of zero or more instances of that
           class, and the constructor for that class will be called with the resulting structures.

       The flags must be chosen from the following:

       "boolean"
           This is a boolean field.  Convert all values to "true" or "false" before sending  the  data  to  Duo.
           Only makes sense with a field of type "simple".

       "set"
           Generate  a  setter  for  this  field.   <b>install_accessors()</b>  will, in addition to adding a method to
           retrieve the value, will add a method named after the field but prefixed with "set_"  that  will  set
           the  value  of  that  field and remember that it's been changed locally.  Changed fields will then be
           pushed back to Duo via the <b>commit()</b> method.

       "zero_or_one"
           This is a boolean field that wants values of 0 or 1.  Convert all values to 1 or 0 before sending the
           data to Duo.  Only makes sense with a field of type "simple".

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       create(DUO, URI, DATA)
           A general constructor for creating a new object in Duo.  Takes a Net::Duo object, the URI of the REST
           endpoint for object creation, and a reference to a hash  of  object  data.   This  method  should  be
           overridden by subclasses to provide the URI and only expose the DUO and DATA arguments to the caller.
           Returns the newly-blessed object containing the data returned by Duo.

       <b>install_accessors()</b>
           Using  the  field specification, creates accessor functions for each data field that return copies of
           the data stored in that field, or undef if there is no data.

       new(DUO, DATA)
           A general constructor for Net::Duo objects.  Takes a Net::Duo object and a reference to a hash, which
           contains the data for an object of the class being constructed.  Using the  field  specification  for
           that  class,  the data will be copied out of the object into a Perl data structure, converting nested
           objects to other Net::Duo objects as required.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       commit(URI)
           A general method for committing changes to an object to Duo.  Takes the URI of the REST endpoint  for
           object  modification.   This  method  should  be overridden by subclasses to provide the URI and only
           expose an argument-less method.

           After <b>commit()</b>, the internal representation of the object will be refreshed to  match  the  new  data
           returned  by  the  Duo  API  for that object.  Therefore, other fields of the object may change after
           <b>commit()</b> if some other user has changed other, unrelated fields in the object.

           It's best to think of this  method  as  a  synchronize  operation:  changed  data  is  written  back,
           overwriting  what's in Duo, and unchanged data may be overwritten by whatever is currently in Duo, if
           it is different.

       <b>json()</b>
           Convert the data stored in the object to JSON and return the  results.   The  resulting  JSON  should
           match the JSON that one would get back from the Duo web service when retrieving the same object (plus
           any  changes  made  locally  to  the  object  via  set_*()  methods).  This is primarily intended for
           debugging dumps or for passing Duo objects to other systems via further JSON APIs.
