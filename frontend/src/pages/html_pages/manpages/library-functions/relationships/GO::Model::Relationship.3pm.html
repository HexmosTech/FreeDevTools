</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
         GO::Model::Relationship - relationship between two terms

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       a relationship between two GO::Model::Terms

       relationships can be thought of as <b>statements</b> or sentences of the form

         SUBJECT-TERM PREDICATE OBJECT-TERM

       for example,

         "dog" IS_A "animal"

         "G-Protein coupled receptor" IS_A "transmembrane receptor"

       Statements have a <b>subject</b> (i.e. the subject of the sentence/statement), a predicate/relationship-type and
       an <b>object</b> (i.e. the object of the sentence/statement)

       Relationships can also be seen as arcs in a directed graph, with the subject being equivalent to the
       child, and the object equivalent to the parent. The arc is labeled with the predicate/relationship-type.

       A Relationship object currently does not contain an actual pointer to a GO::Model::Term object. Instead
       it stores the ID of that term. This is intended to be used in conjunction with the Graph object, or with
       the database.

   <b>subject_acc</b>
        Title   : subject_acc
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;subject_acc($newid)
        Usage   : $currid = $obj-&gt;subject_acc()
        Synonyms: subj_acc, acc2, child_acc
        Function: gets or sets the identifier for the child/subject term
        Example :
        Returns : value of subject_acc (string)
        Args    : on set, new value (string)

       All Relationships can be thought of "subject-predicate-object" statements. The statement is *about* the
       subject, and states something about the relationship *to* the object.

       For example, the if we have a Relationship:

         cell
           ^
           |
           | [part_of]
           |
        cell nucleus

       This is a statement about cell nuclei in general, so "cell nucleus" is the subject (sometimes called the
       child node). The Relationship tells us that all cell nuclei are part_of some cell, so the object of the
       relationship (sometimes called the parent node) is "cell"

   <b>object_acc</b>
        Title   : object_acc
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;object_acc($newid)
        Usage   : $currid = $obj-&gt;object_acc()
        Synonyms: obj_acc, acc1, parent_acc
        Function: gets or sets the identifier for the parent/object term
        Example :
        Returns : value of object_acc (string)
        Args    : on set, new value (string)
        See Also: subj_acc

   <b>type</b>
        Title   : type
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;type($newval)
        Usage   : $currval = $obj-&gt;type()
        Synonyms:
        Function: gets or sets the relationship type (a string)
        Example :
        Returns : value of type (string)
        Args    : on set, new value (string)

       Currently any string is allowed; in future the type string may be constrained to come from a controlled
       vocabulary of relationship types
