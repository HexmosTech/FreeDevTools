       Bio::Das::FeatureTypeI - Simple interface to Sequence Ontology feature types

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # Get a Bio::Das::FeatureTypeI object from somewhere
         $term = $db-&gt;fetch....

         # Get the name of the term
         $definition = $term-&gt;name;

         # Get the accession of the term
         $accession = $term-&gt;accession;

         # Get the definition of the term
         $definition = $term-&gt;definition;

         # Get the parents of the term, optionally filtered by relationship
         @parents = $term-&gt;parents($relationship);

         # Get the children of the term, optionally filtered by relationship
         @children = $term-&gt;children($relationship);

         # Given a parent and child, returns their relationship, or undef if
         # not directly related
         $relationship = $parent-&gt;relationship($child);

         # Return true if two terms are identical
         $match = $term1-&gt;equals($term2);

         # Return true if $term2 is a descendent of $term1, optionally
         # filtering by relationship ("isa" assumed)
         $match = $term1-&gt;is_descendent($term2,$relationship);

         # Return true if $term2 is a parent of $term1, optionally
         # filtering by relationship ("isa" assumed)
         $match = $term1-&gt;is_parent($term2,$relationship);

         # Return true if $term2 is equal to $term1 or if $term2 descends
         # from term 1 via the "isa" relationship
         $match = $term1-&gt;match($term2);

         # Create a new term de novo
         $term = Bio::Das::FeatureTypeI-&gt;new(-name       =&gt; $name,
                                             -accession  =&gt; $accession,
                                             -definition =&gt; $definition);

         # Add a child to a term
         $term1-&gt;add_child($term2,$relationship);

         # Delete a child from a term
         $term1-&gt;delete_child($term2);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::Das::FeatureTypeI is an interface to the Gene Ontology Consortium's Sequence Ontology (SO).  The SO,
       like other ontologies, is a directed acyclic graph in which a child node may have multiple parents.  The
       relationship between parent and child is one of a list of relationships.  The SO currently recognizes two
       relationships "isa" and "partof".

       The intent of this interface is to interoperate with older software that uses bare strings to represent
       feature types.  For this reason, the interface overloads the stringify ("") and string equals (eq)
       operations.

</pre><h4><b>APPENDIX</b></h4><pre>
       The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods. Internal methods are usually preceded
       with a _

       this is somehow FUBAR, implementation classes cannot successfully inherit from Bio::Das::FeatureTypeI

   <b>name</b>
        Title   : name
        Usage   : $string = $term-&gt;name
        Function: return the term for the type
        Returns : a string
        Args    : none
        Status  : Public

   <b>accession</b>
        Title   : accession
        Usage   : $string = $term-&gt;accession
        Function: return the accession number for the term
        Returns : a string
        Args    : none
        Status  : Public

   <b>definition</b>
        Title   : definition
        Usage   : $string = $term-&gt;definition
        Function: return the human-readable definition for the term
        Returns : a string
        Args    : none
        Status  : Public

   <b>parents</b>
        Title   : parents
        Usage   : @terms = $term-&gt;parents($relationship)
        Function: return parent terms
        Returns : list of Bio::Das::FeatureTypeI
        Args    : none
        Status  : Public

       Returns the parents for the current term, empty if there are none.  An optional relationship argument
       will return those parents that are related via the specified relationship type.

       The relationship is one of "isa" or "partof".

   <b>children</b>
        Title   : children
        Usage   : @terms = $term-&gt;children($relationship)
        Function: return children terms
        Returns : list of Bio::Das::FeatureTypeI
        Args    : none
        Status  : Public

       Returns the children for the current term, empty if there are none.  An optional relationship argument
       will return those children that are related via the specified relationship type.

       The relationship is one of "isa" or "partof".

   <b>relationship</b>
        Title   : relationship
        Usage   : $relationship = $parent-&gt;relationship($child)
        Function: return the relationship between a parent and a child
        Returns : one of "isa" or "partof"
        Args    : none
        Status  : Public

       This method returns the relationship between a parent and one of its immediate descendents.  It can
       return "isa", "partof", or undef if there is not a direct parent/child relationship (kissing cousins are
       *not* recognized).

   <b>equals</b>
        Title   : equals
        Usage   : $boolean = $term1-&gt;equals($term2)
        Function: return true if $term1 and $term2 are the same
        Returns : boolean
        Args    : second term
        Status  : Public

       The two terms must be identical.  In practice, this means that if term2 is a Bio::Das::FeatureI object,
       then its accession number must match the first term's accession number.  Otherwise, if term2 is a bare
       string, then it must equal (in a case insensitive manner) the name of term1.

       NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS: This method is defined in terms of other methods, so does not need to be
       implemented.

   <b>is_descendent</b>
        Title   : is_descendent
        Usage   : $boolean = $term1-&gt;is_descendent($term2 [,$relationship])
        Function: return true of $term2 is a descendent of $term1
        Returns : boolean
        Args    : second term
        Status  : Public

       This method returns true if $term2 descends from $term1.  The operation traverses the tree.  The
       traversal can be limited to the relationship type ("isa" or "partof") if desired.  $term2 can be a bare
       string, in which case the term names will be used as the basis for term matching (see <b>equals()</b>).

       NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS: this method is defined as the inverse of <b>is_parent()</b>.  Do not implement it
       directly, but do implement <b>is_parent()</b>.

   <b>is_parent</b>
        Title   : is_parent
        Usage   : $boolean = $term1-&gt;is_parent($term2 [,$relationship])
        Function: return true of $term2 is a parent of $term1
        Returns : boolean
        Args    : second term
        Status  : Public

       This method returns true if $term2 is a parent of $term1.  The operation traverses the tree.  The
       traversal can be limited to the relationship type ("isa" or "partof") if desired.  $term2 can be a bare
       string, in which case the term names will be used as the basis for term matching (see <b>equals()</b>).

       NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS: Implementing this method will also implement <b>is_descendent()</b>.

   <b>match</b>
        Title   : match
        Usage   : $boolean = $term1-&gt;match($term2)
        Function: return true if $term1 equals $term2 or if $term2 is an "isa" descendent
        Returns : boolean
        Args    : second term
        Status  : Public

       This method combines <b>equals()</b> and <b>is_descendent()</b> in such a way that the two terms will match if they are
       the same or if the second term is an instance of the first one.  This is also the basis of the operator
       overloading of eq.

       NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS: This method is defined in terms of other methods and does not need to be
       implemented.

   <b>new</b>
        Title   : new
        Usage   : $term = Bio::Das::FeatureTypeI-&gt;new(@args)
        Function: create a new term
        Returns : new term
        Args    : see below
        Status  : Public

       This method creates a new Bio::Das::FeatureTypeI.  Arguments:

         Argument    Description
         --------   ------------

         -name       Name of this term

         -accession  Accession number for the term

         -definition Definition of the term

   <b>add_child</b>
        Title   : add_child
        Usage   : $boolean = $term-&gt;add_child($term2,$relationship)
        Function: add a child to a term
        Returns : a boolean indicating success
        Args    : new child
        Throws  : a "cycle detected" exception
        Status  : Public

       This method adds a new child to the indicated node.  It may detect a cycle in the DAG and throw a "cycle
       detected" exception.

   <b>delete_child</b>
        Title   : delete_child
        Usage   : $boolean = $term-&gt;delete_child($term2);
        Function: delete a child of the term
        Returns : a boolean indicating success
        Args    : child to be deleted
        Throws  : a "not a child" exception
        Status  : Public

       This method deletes a new child from the indicated node.  It will throw an exception if the indicated
       child is not a direct descendent.
