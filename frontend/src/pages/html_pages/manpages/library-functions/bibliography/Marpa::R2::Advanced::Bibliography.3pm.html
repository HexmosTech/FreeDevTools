       Marpa::R2::Advanced::Bibliography - A Marpa bibliography

</pre><h4><b>History</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Marpa</b> <b>algorithm</b></h4><pre>
       1970
           Jay Earley invents the algorithm that now bears his name.

       1991
           Joop Leo describes a way to modify Earley's algorithm so that it runs in O(n) time for all LR-regular
           grammars.   LR-regular  is  a  vast class of grammars, including all the LR(k) grammars, all grammars
           parseable with recursive descent, and regular expressions.  LR-regular can safely be  thought  of  as
           including all grammars in practical use today, and then some.

       2002
           Aycock  and  Horspool describe a way to do <b><a href="../man0/LR.0.html">LR</a></b>(0) precomputation for Earley's algorithm.  Their method
           makes Earley's faster in most practical situations, but  not  all.   In  particular,  right-recursion
           remains  quadratic in the Aycock and Horspool algorithm.  Worst case is no better than Earley's.  Leo
           is unaware of Aycock and Horspool's work and Aycock and Horspool seem unaware of Leo.

       2010
           Marpa combines the Leo and Aycock-Horspool algorithms, in the process making significant  changes  to
           both of them.  The result preserves the best features of both.  Marpa also tackles the many remaining
           implementation issues.

   <b>Aho</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ullman</b> <b>1972</b>
       <u>The</u>  <u>Theory</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>Parsing,</u>  <u>Translation</u>  <u>and</u> <u>Compiling,</u> <u>Volume</u> <u>I:</u> <u>Parsing</u> by Alfred Aho and Jeffrey Ullman
       (Prentice-Hall: Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1972).  I think this was the standard source  for  Earley's
       algorithm  for  decades.   It  certainly was <b>my</b> standard source.  The account of Earley's algorithm is on
       pages 320-330.

   <b>Aycock</b> <b>and</b> <b>Horspool</b> <b>2002</b>
       Marpa is based on ideas from John Aycock  and  R.   Nigel  Horspool's  "Practical  Earley  Parsing",  <u>The</u>
       <u>Computer</u> <u>Journal</u>, Vol. 45, No. 6, 2002, pp. 620-630.  The idea of doing <b><a href="../man0/LR.0.html">LR</a></b>(0) precomputation for Earley's
       general  parsing  algorithm,  and Marpa's approach to handling nullable symbols and rules, both came from
       this article.

       The  Aycock  and  Horspool  paper  summarizes  Earley's  very  nicely  and  is  available  on  the   web:
       &lt;<a href="http://www.cs.uvic.ca/~nigelh/Publications/PracticalEarleyParsing.pdf">http://www.cs.uvic.ca/~nigelh/Publications/PracticalEarleyParsing.pdf</a>&gt;.   Unlike  "Earley  1970", Aycock
       and Horspool 2002 is <b>not</b> easy reading.  I have been following this particular topic on and off for  years
       and nonetheless found this paper very heavy going.

   <b>Dominus</b> <b>2005</b>
       Although  my  approach  to  parsing  is  not influenced by Mark Jason Dominus's <u>Higher</u> <u>Order</u> <u>Perl</u>, Mark's
       treatment of parsing is an excellent introduction to parsing, especially in a Perl context.  His focus on
       just about every other technique <b>except</b> general BNF parsing is pretty much  standard,  and  will  help  a
       beginner understand how unconventional Marpa's approach is.

       Mark's  book  opened  my  eyes  to many new ideas.  Both Mark's Perl and his English are examples of good
       writing, and the book is dense with insights.  Mark's discussion on memoization in Chapter 3 is the  best
       I've seen.  I wish I'd bought his book earlier in my coding.

       Mark's  book  is  available on-line.  You can download chapter-by-chapter or the whole thing at once, and
       you can take your pick of his original sources or PDF, at &lt;<a href="http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/">http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/</a>&gt;.  A  PDF  of
       the parsing chapter is at &lt;<a href="http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/pdf/08Parsing.pdf">http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/pdf/08Parsing.pdf</a>&gt;.

   <b>Earley</b> <b>1970</b>
       Of  Jay  Earley's  papers  on  his general parsing algorithm, the most readily available is "An efficient
       context-free parsing algorithm", <u>Communications</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Association</u> <u>for</u> <u>Computing</u> <u>Machinery</u>,  13:2:94-102,
       1970.

       Ordinarily,  I'd  not  bother  pointing  out  35-year  old nits in a brilliant and historically important
       article.  But more than a few people treat this article as not just the first word in Earley parsing, but
       the last as well.  Many implementations of Earley's algorithm come,  directly  and  unaltered,  from  his
       paper.  These implementers and their users need to be aware of two issues.

       First, the recognition engine itself, as described, has a serious bug.  There's an easy fix, but one that
       greatly  slows down an algorithm whose main problem, in its original form, was speed.  This issue is well
       laid out by Aycock and Horspool in their article.

       Second, according to Tomita there is a mistake in the parse tree representation.  See page 153 of  "Grune
       and  Jacobs  1990",  page  210  of "Grune and Jacobs 2008", and the bibliography entry for Earley 1970 in
       "Grune and Jacobs 2008".  In the printed edition of the 2008 bibliography, the entry is on page 578,  and
       on  the  web (&lt;<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.vu.nl/pub/dick/PTAPG_2nd_Edition/CompleteList.pdf">ftp://ftp.cs.vu.nl/pub/dick/PTAPG_2nd_Edition/CompleteList.pdf</a>&gt;), it's on pp. 583-584.  My
       methods for producing parse results from Earley sets do not  come  from  Earley  1970,  so  I  am  taking
       Tomita's word on this one.

   <b>Grune</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jacobs</b> <b>1990</b>
       <u>Parsing</u>  <u>Techniques:</u>  <u>A</u>  <u>Practical</u>  <u>Guide</u>,  by  Dick  Grune  and  Ceriel  Jacobs, (Ellis Horwood Limited:
       Chichester,   West   Sussex,   England,   1990).     This    book    is    available    on    the    Web:
       &lt;<a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dick/PTAPG.html">http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dick/PTAPG.html</a>&gt;

   <b>Grune</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jacobs</b> <b>2008</b>
       <u>Parsing</u> <u>Techniques:</u> <u>A</u> <u>Practical</u> <u>Guide</u>, by Dick Grune and Ceriel Jacobs, 2nd Edition.  (Springer: New York
       NY,  2008).   This  is  the  most  authoritative and comprehensive introduction to parsing I know of.  In
       theory it requires no mathematics, only a programming background, but even so it is moderately  difficult
       reading.

       This is "Grune and Jacobs 1990" updated.  The bibliography for this book is available in enlarged form on
       the web: &lt;<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.vu.nl/pub/dick/PTAPG_2nd_Edition/CompleteList.pdf">ftp://ftp.cs.vu.nl/pub/dick/PTAPG_2nd_Edition/CompleteList.pdf</a>&gt;.

   <b>Kegler</b> <b>2013</b>
       My  writeup  of  the  theory  behind  Marpa,  with  proofs  of correctness and of my complexity claims is
       available online: &lt;https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9_mR_M2zOc4Ni1zSW5IYzk3TGc/edit?usp=sharing&gt;.

   <b>Leo</b> <b>1991</b>
       Marpa's handling of right-recursion uses the ideas in Joop M.I.M. Leo's "A General  Context-Free  Parsing
       Algorithm  Running  in  Linear Time on Every LR(k) Grammar Without Using Lookahead", <u>Theoretical</u> <u>Computer</u>
       <u>Science</u>, Vol. 82, No. 1, 1991, pp 165-176.  This is a difficult paper.  Unfortunately, there is  no  copy
       of it on-line.

   <b>Wikipedia</b>
       Wikipedia's article on Backus-Naur form is &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus-Naur_form">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus-Naur_form</a>&gt;.  It's a great
       place  to start if you don't know the basics of grammars and parsing.  As Wikipedia points out, BNF might
       better be called Panini-Backus Form.  The grammarian Panini gave a precise description of  Sanskrit  more
       than 23 centuries earlier in India using a similar notation.
