       doctools::cvs - Processing text in 'cvs log' format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       package require <b>Tcl</b> <b>8.5</b> <b>9</b>

       package require <b>textutil</b>

       package require <b>doctools::cvs</b> <b>?1.1?</b>

       <b>::doctools::cvs::scanLog</b> <u>text</u> <u>evar</u> <u>cvar</u> <u>fvar</u>

       <b>::doctools::cvs::toChangeLog</b> <u>evar</u> <u>cvar</u> <u>fvar</u>

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  package  provides  Tcl commands for the processing and reformatting text in the format generated by
       the <b>cvs</b> <b>log</b> command.

       The commands <b>::doctools::cvs::scanLog</b> and <b>::doctools::cvs::toChangeLog</b> are derived from code found on the
       <u>Tcl'ers</u> <u>Wiki</u> [<a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk">http://wiki.tcl.tk</a>]. See the references at the end of the page.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       <b>::doctools::cvs::scanLog</b> <u>text</u> <u>evar</u> <u>cvar</u> <u>fvar</u>
              The command takes the <u>text</u> and parses it under the assumption  that  it  contains  a  CVS  log  as
              generated  by  <b>cvs</b>  <b>log</b>.  The  resulting  information  is stored in the variables whose names were
              specified via <u>evar</u>, <u>cvar</u>, and <u>fvar</u>.

              Already existing information in the referenced variables is  preserved,  allowing  the  caller  to
              merge data from multiple logs into one database.

              varname <u>evar</u> (in)
                     Has  to refer to a scalar variable. After the call this variable will contain a list of all
                     the entries found in the log file. An entry is identified through the combination  of  date
                     and author, and can be split over multiple physical entries, one per touched file.

                     It  should be noted that the entries are listed in the same order as they were found in the
                     <u>text</u>. This is not necessarily sorted by date or author.

                     Each item in the list is a list containing two elements, the date of  the  entry,  and  its
                     author, in this order. The date is formatted as <b>year</b>/<b>month</b>/<b>day</b>.

              varname <u>cvar</u> (in)
                     Has  to  refer to an array variable. Keys are strings containing the date and author of log
                     entries, in this order, separated by a comma.

                     The values are lists of comments made for the entry.

              varname <u>fvar</u> (in)
                     Has to refer to an array variable. Keys are strings containing date, author of a log entry,
                     and a comment for that entry, in this order, separated by commas.

                     The values are lists of the files the entry is touching.

       <b>::doctools::cvs::toChangeLog</b> <u>evar</u> <u>cvar</u> <u>fvar</u>
              The three arguments for this command are the same as the  last  three  arguments  of  the  command
              <b>::doctools::cvs::scanLog</b>.  This  command  however expects them to be filled with information about
              one or more logs. It takes this information and converts it  into  a  text  in  the  format  of  a
              ChangeLog  as  accepted  and generated by <b>emacs</b>. The constructed text is returned as the result of
              the command.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS,</b> <b>IDEAS,</b> <b>FEEDBACK</b></h4><pre>
       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain bugs and  other  problems.   Please
       report  such  in  the  category  <u>doctools</u>  of the <u>Tcllib</u> <u>Trackers</u> [<a href="http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist">http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist</a>].
       Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or documentation.

       When proposing code changes, please provide <u>unified</u> <u>diffs</u>, i.e the output of <b>diff</b> <b>-u</b>.

       Note further that <u>attachments</u> are strongly preferred over inlined patches. Attachments  can  be  made  by
       going  to the <b>Edit</b> form of the ticket immediately after its creation, and then using the left-most button
       in the secondary navigation bar.
