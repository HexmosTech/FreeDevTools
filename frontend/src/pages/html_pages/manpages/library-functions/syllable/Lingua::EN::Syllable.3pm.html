</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Lingua::EN::Syllable - count the number of syllables in English words

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Lingua::EN::Syllable;

         $count = syllable('supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'); # 14

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Lingua::EN::Syllable::syllable()</b> estimates the number of syllables in the word passed to it.

       Note that it isn't entirely accurate...  it fails (by one syllable) for about 10-15% of my
       /usr/dict/words.  The only way to get a 100% accurate count is to do a dictionary lookup, so this is a
       small and fast alternative where more-or-less accurate results will suffice, such as estimating the
       reading level of a document.

       I welcome pointers to more accurate algorithms, since this one is pretty quick-and-dirty.  This was
       designed for English (well, American at least) words, but sometimes guesses well for other languages.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Accuracy for words with non-alpha characters is somewhat undefined.  In general, punctuation characters,
       et al, should be trimmed off before handing the word to <b>syllable()</b>, and hyphenated compounds should be
       broken into their separate parts.

       Syllables for all-digit words (eg, "1998";  some call them "numbers") are often counted as the number of
       digits.  A cooler solution would be converting "1998" to "nineteen eighty eight" (or "one thousand nine
       hundred eighty eight", or...), but that is left as an exercise for the reader.

       Contractions are not well supported.

       Compound words (like "lifeboat"), where the first word ends in a silent 'e' are counted with an extra
       syllable.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Lingua::Phonology - a framework of classes that provide "an object model for lingistic phonology and
       sound change".  That includes syllables, and it looks like you can use it to get syllables for words, but
       from a quick skim of the doc I can't see exactly how.

       Text::Info - a new module (as of late 2015) that provides information about text in Germanic languages,
       including syllable count.
