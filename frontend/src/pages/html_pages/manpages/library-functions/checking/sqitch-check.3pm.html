</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       sqitch-check - Checks for divergences between planned and deployed changes.

</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
         sqitch check [options] [&lt;database&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Compares the state of the working directory and the database by comparing the SHA1 hashes of the deploy
       scripts. Fails and reports divergence for all changes with non-matching hashes, indicating that the
       project deploy scripts differ from the scripts that were used to deploy to the database.

       The "&lt;database&gt;" parameter specifies the database to which to connect, and may also be specified as the
       "--target" option. It can be target name, a URI, an engine name, or plan file path.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       "-t"
       "--target"
           The  target  database to which to connect. This option can be either a URI or the name of a target in
           the configuration.

       "--project"
           Project for which to retrieve the status. Defaults to the status of the current project,  if  a  plan
           can be found.

       "--registry"
             sqitch check --registry registry

           The name of the Sqitch registry schema or database in which sqitch stores its own data.

       "--db-client"
       "--client"
             sqitch check --client /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql

           Path  to  the  command-line  client for the database engine. Defaults to a client in the current path
           named appropriately for the database engine.

       "-d"
       "--db-name"
             sqitch check --db-name widgets
             sqitch check -d bricolage

           Name of the database. In general, targets and URIs are preferred, but this  option  can  be  used  to
           override the database name in a target.

       "-u"
       "--db-user"
       "--db-username"
             sqitch check --db-username root
             sqitch check --db-user postgres
             sqitch check -u Mom

           User  name to use when connecting to the database. Does not apply to all engines. In general, targets
           and URIs are preferred, but this option can be used to override the user name in a target.

       "-h"
       "--db-host"
             sqitch check --db-host db.example.com
             sqitch check -h appdb.example.net

           Host name to use when connecting to the database. Does not apply to all engines. In general,  targets
           and URIs are preferred, but this option can be used to override the host name in a target.

       "-p"
       "--db-port"
             sqitch check --db-port 7654
             sqitch check -p 5431

           Port number to connect to. Does not apply to all engines. In general, targets and URIs are preferred,
           but this option can be used to override the port in a target.

       "--plan-file"
       "-f"
             sqitch check --plan-file my.plan
