</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "Data::Checks" - Value constraint checking

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       With Signature::Attribute::Checked:

          use v5.26;
          use Sublike::Extended;
          use Signature::Attribute::Checked;

          use Data::Checks qw( Str );

          extended sub greet ( $message :Checked(Str) ) {
             say "Hello, $message";
          }

          greet( "world" );  # is fine
          greet( undef );    # throws an exception

       With Object::Pad::FieldAttr::Checked:

          use v5.22;
          use Object::Pad;
          use Object::Pad::FieldAttr::Checked;

          use Data::Checks qw( Str );

          class Datum {
             field $name :param :reader :Checked(Str);
          }

          my $x = Datum-&gt;new( name =&gt; "something" );  # is fine
          my $y = Datum-&gt;new( name =&gt; undef );        # throws an exception

       With Syntax::Operator::Is on Perl v5.38 or later:

          use v5.38;
          use Syntax::Operator::Is;

          use Data::Checks qw( Num Object );

          my $x = ...;

          if($x is Num) {
             say "x can be used as a number";
          }
          elsif($x is Object) {
             say "x can be used as an object";
          }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides functions that implement various value constraint checking behaviours. These are the
       parts made visible by the "use Data::Checks ..." import line, in Perl code.

       It also provides the underlying common framework XS functions to assist in writing modules that actually
       implement such constraint checking. These parts are not visible in Perl code, but instead made visible at
       the XS level by the "#include "DataChecks.h"" directive.

       See the "SYNOPSIS" section above for several examples of other CPAN modules that make direct use of these
       constraint checks.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRAINTS</b></h4><pre>
       The following constraint checks are inspired by the same-named ones in Types::Standard. They may be
       called fully-qualified, or imported <u>lexically</u> into the calling scope.

       <b>Note</b> to users familiar with "Types::Standard": some of these functions behave slightly differently. In
       particular, these constraints are generally happy to accept an object reference to a class that provides
       a conversion overload, whereas the ones in "Types::Standard" often are not. Additionally functions that
       are parametric take their parameters in normal Perl function argument lists, not wrapped in additional
       array references.

   <b>Defined</b>
          Defined()

       Accepts any defined value, rejects only "undef".

   <b>Object</b>
          Object()

       Accepts any blessed object reference, rejects non-references or references to unblessed data.

   <b>Str</b>
          Str()

       Accepts any defined non-reference value, or a reference to an object in a class that overloads
       stringification. Rejects undefined, unblessed references, or references to objects in classes that do not
       overload stringification.

   <b>StrEq</b>
          StrEq($s)
          StrEq($s1, $s2, ...)

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.05.</u>

       Accepts any value that passes the Str check, and additionally is exactly equal to <u>any</u> <u>of</u> the given
       strings.

   <b>StrMatch</b>
          StrMatch(qr/pattern/)

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.08.</u>

       Accepts any value that passes the Str check, and additionally matches the given regexp pattern.

       Remember that the pattern must be supplied as a "qr/.../" expression, not simply "m/.../" or "/.../".

   <b>Num</b>
          Num()

       Accepts any defined non-reference value that is either a plain number, or a string that could be used as
       one without warning, or a reference to an object in a class that overloads numification.

       Rejects undefined, not-a-number, strings that would raise a warning if converted to a number, unblessed
       references, or references to objects in classes that do not overload numification.

   <b>NumGT</b>
   <b>NumGE</b>
   <b>NumLE</b>
   <b>NumLT</b>
          NumGT($bound)
          NumGE($bound)
          NumLE($bound)
          NumLT($bound)

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.05.</u>

       Accepts any value that passes the Num check, and additionally is within the bound given. "NumGT" and
       "NumLT" exclude the bound value itself, "NumGE" and "NumLE" include it.

   <b>NumRange</b>
          NumRange($boundge, $boundlt)

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.05.</u>

       Accepts any value that passes the Num check, and additionally is between the two bounds given. The lower
       bound is inclusive, and the upper bound is exclusive.

       This choice is made so that a set of "NumRange" constraints can easily be created that cover distinct
       sets of numbers:

          NumRange(0, 10), NumRange(10, 20), NumRange(20, 30), ...

       To implement checks with both lower and upper bounds but other kinds of inclusivity, use two "Num..."
       checks combined with an All(). For example, to test between 0 and 100 inclusive at both ends:

          All(<a href="../man0/NumGE.0.html">NumGE</a>(0), <a href="../man100/NumLE.100.html">NumLE</a>(100))

       Combinations like this are internally implemented as efficiently as a single NumRange() constraint.

   <b>NumEq</b>
          NumEq($n)
          NumEq($n1, $n2, ...)

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.05.</u>

       Accepts any value that passes the Num check, and additionally is exactly equal to <u>any</u> <u>of</u> the given
       numbers.

   <b>Isa</b>
          Isa($classname)

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.04.</u>

       Accepts any blessed object reference to an instance of the given class name, or a subclass derived from
       it (i.e. anything accepted by the "isa" operator).

   <b>ArrayRef</b>
          ArrayRef()

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.07.</u>

       Accepts any plain reference to an array, or any object reference to an instance of a class that provides
       an array dereference overload.

   <b>HashRef</b>
          HashRef()

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.07.</u>

       Accepts any plain reference to a hash, or any object reference to an instance of a class that provides a
       hash dereference overload.

   <b>Callable</b>
          Callable()

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.06.</u>

       Accepts any plain reference to a subroutine, or any object reference to an instance of a class that
       provides a subroutine dereference overload.

   <b>Maybe</b>
          Maybe($C)

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.04.</u>

       Accepts "undef" in addition to anything else accepted by the given constraint.

   <b>Any</b>
          Any($C1, $C2, ...)

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.07.</u>

       Accepts a value that is accepted by at least one of the given constraints.  Rejects if none of them
       accept it.

       At least one constraint is required; it is an error to try to call Any() with no arguments. If you need a
       constraint that accepts any value at all, see "All".

          $C1 | $C2 | ...

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.08.</u>

       This function is used to implement "|" operator overloading, so constraint checks can be written using
       this more convenient syntax.

   <b>All</b>
          All($C1, $C2, ...)
          All()

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.07.</u>

       Accepts a value that is accepted by every one of the given constraints.  Rejects if at least one of them
       rejects it.

       Note that if no constraints are given, this accepts all possible values. This may be useful as an
       "accept-all" fallback case for generated code, or other situations where it is required to provide a
       constraint check but you do not wish to constraint allowed values.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRAINT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       While not intended to be called from regular Perl code, these constraints still act like objects with the
       following methods.

   <b>check</b>
          $ok = $constraint-&gt;check( $value );

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.09.</u>

       Returns a boolean value indicating whether the constraint accepts the given value.

</pre><h4><b>XS</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following functions are provided by the <u>DataChecks.h</u> header file for use in XS modules that implement
       value constraint checking.

   <b>boot_data_checks</b>
          void boot_data_checks(double ver);

       Call this function from your "BOOT" section in order to initialise the module and load the rest of the
       support functions.

       <u>ver</u> should either be 0 or a decimal number for the module version requirement; e.g.

          boot_data_checks(0.01);

   <b>make_checkdata</b>
          struct DataChecks_Checker *make_checkdata(SV *checkspec);

       Creates a "struct DataChecks_Checker" structure, which wraps the intent of the value constraint check.
       The returned value is used as the <u>checker</u> argument for the remaining functions.

       The constraint check itself is specified by the "SV" given by <u>checkspec</u>, which should come directly from
       the user code. The constraint check may be specified in any of three ways:

       •   An <b>object</b> reference in a class which has a "check" method. Value checks will be invoked as

              $ok = $checkerobj-&gt;check( $value );

       •   A  <b>package</b>  name  as  a  plain  string of a package which has a "check" method.  Value checks will be
           invoked as

              $ok = $checkerpkg-&gt;check( $value );

       •   A <b>code</b> <b>reference</b>. Value checks will be invoked with a single argument, as

              $ok = $checkersub-&gt;( $value );

           <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.09</u> this form is now deprecated, because it does not easily support a way to query the
           constraint for its name or stringified form, which is useful when generating error messages.

       •   Additionally, the constraint check functions provided by this module may be implemented using any  of
           the  above  mechanisms, or may use an unspecified fourth different mechanism. Outside code should not
           rely on what that mechanism may be.

       Once constructed into a checker structure, the choice of which implementation is used is fixed, and if  a
       method  lookup  is  involved  its  result  is  stored  directly  as  a CV pointer for efficiency of later
       invocations. In either of the first two cases, the reference count on the <u>checkspec</u> SV  is  increased  to
       account  for  the  argument  value  used  on  each invocation. In the third case, the reference SV is not
       retained, but the underlying CV it refers to has its reference count increased.

   <b>free_checkdata</b>
          void free_checkdata(struct DataChecks_Checker *checker);

       Releases any stored SVs in the checker structure, and the structure itself.

   <b>gen_assertmess</b>
          void gen_assertmess(struct DataChecks_Checker *checker, SV *name, SV *constraint);

       Generates and stores a message  string  for  the  assert  message  to  be  used  by  "make_assertop"  and
       "assert_value". The message will take the form

          NAME requires a value satisfying CONSTRAINT

       Both  <u>name</u> and <u>constraint</u> SVs used as temporary strings to generate the stored message string. Neither SV
       is retained by the checker directly.

   <b>make_assertop</b>
          OP *make_assertop(struct DataChecks_Checker *checker, OP *argop);

       Shortcut to calling "make_assertop_flags" with <u>flags</u> set to zero.

   <b>make_assertop_flags</b>
          OP *make_assertop_flags(struct DataChecks_Checker *checker, U32 flags, OP *argop);

       Creates an optree fragment for a value check assertion operation.

       Given an optree fragment in scalar context that generates an argument value (<u>argop</u>), constructs a  larger
       optree  fragment  that consumes it and checks that the value is accepted by the constraint check given by
       <u>checker</u>. The behaviours of the returned optree fragment will depend on the <u>flags</u>.

       If <u>flags</u> is "OPf_WANT_VOID" the returned optree will yield nothing.

       If <u>flags</u> is zero, the return behaviour is not otherwise specified.

   <b>check_value</b>
          bool check_value(struct DataChecks_Checker *checker, SV *value);

       Checks whether a given SV is accepted by the given constraint check, returning true if so,  or  false  if
       not.

   <b>assert_value</b>
          void assert_value(struct DataChecks_Checker *checker, SV *value);

       Checks whether a given SV is accepted by the given constraint check, throwing its assertion message if it
       does not.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       •   Unit  constraints  -  maybe "Int", some plain-only variants of "Str" and "Num", some reference types,
           etc...

       •   Structural constraints - "HashOf", "ArrayOf", etc...

       •   Think about a convenient name for inclusive-bounded numerical constraints.

       •   Look into making const-folding work with the "MIN .. MAX" flip-flop operator
