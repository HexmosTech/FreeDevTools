</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mail::DKIM::Verifier - verifies a DKIM-signed message

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.20230212

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Mail::DKIM::Verifier;

         # create a verifier object
         my $dkim = Mail::DKIM::Verifier-&gt;new();

         # read an email from a file handle
         $dkim-&gt;load(*STDIN);

         # or read an email and pass it into the verifier, incrementally
         while (&lt;STDIN&gt;)
         {
             # remove local line terminators
             chomp;
             s/\015$//;

             # use SMTP line terminators
             $dkim-&gt;PRINT("$_\015\012");
         }
         $dkim-&gt;CLOSE;

         # what is the result of the verify?
         my $result = $dkim-&gt;result;

         # there might be multiple signatures, what is the result per signature?
         foreach my $signature ($dkim-&gt;signatures)
         {
             print 'signature identity: ' . $signature-&gt;identity . "\n";
             print 'verify result: ' . $signature-&gt;result_detail . "\n";
         }

         # the alleged author of the email may specify how to handle email
         foreach my $policy ($dkim-&gt;policies)
         {
             die 'fraudulent message' if ($policy-&gt;apply($dkim) eq 'reject');
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The verifier object allows an email message to be scanned for DKIM and DomainKeys signatures and those
       signatures to be verified. The verifier tracks the state of the message as it is read into memory. When
       the message has been completely read, the signatures are verified and the results of the verification can
       be accessed.

       To use the verifier, first create the verifier object. Then start "feeding" it the email message to be
       verified. When all the _headers_ have been read, the verifier:

        1. checks whether any DomainKeys/DKIM signatures were found
        2. queries for the public keys needed to verify the signatures
        3. sets up the appropriate algorithms and canonicalization objects
        4. canonicalizes the headers and computes the header hash

       Then, when the _body_ of the message has been completely fed into the verifier, the body hash is computed
       and the signatures are verified.

       The results of the verification can be checked with "<b>result()</b>" or "<b>signatures()</b>".

       Messages that do not verify may be checked against the alleged sender's published signing policy with
       "<b>policies()</b>" and "<b>apply()</b>" in Mail::DKIM::Policy.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new()</b>
       Constructs an object-oriented verifier.

         my $dkim = Mail::DKIM::Verifier-&gt;new();

         my $dkim = Mail::DKIM::Verifier-&gt;new(%options);

       The only options supported at this time are:

       Debug_Canonicalization
           if  specified,  the canonicalized message for the first signature is written to the referenced string
           or file handle.

       Strict
           If true, rejects sha1 hashes and signing keys shorter than 1024 bits.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>PRINT()</b>
       Feeds part of the message to the verifier.

         $dkim-&gt;PRINT("a line of the message\015\012");
         $dkim-&gt;PRINT('more of');
         $dkim-&gt;PRINT(" the message\015\012bye\015\012");

       Feeds content of the message being verified into the verifier.  The API is designed this way so that  the
       entire message does NOT need to be read into memory at once.

       Please  note  that although the <b>PRINT()</b> method expects you to use SMTP-style line termination characters,
       you should NOT use the SMTP-style dot-stuffing technique described in RFC 2821 section 4.5.2.  Nor should
       you use a &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; sequence to terminate the message.

   <b>CLOSE()</b>
       Call this when finished feeding in the message.

         $dkim-&gt;CLOSE;

       This method finishes the canonicalization process, computes a hash, and verifies the signature.

   <b>fetch_author_domain_policies()</b>
       Retrieves ADSP records from DNS.

         my @policies = $dkim-&gt;fetch_author_domain_policies;
         foreach my $policy (@policies)
         {
             my $policy_result = $policy-&gt;apply($dkim);
         }

       This method will retrieve all applicable "author-domain-signing-practices"  published  in  DNS  for  this
       message.  Author policies are keyed to the email address(es) in the From: header, i.e. the claimed author
       of the message.

       This  method  returns  a  *list*  of  policy records, since there is allowed to be zero or multiple email
       addresses in the From: header.

       The result of the <b>apply()</b> method is one of: "accept", "reject", "neutral".

       See also: "<b>policies()</b>".

   <b>fetch_author_policy()</b>
       Retrieves a signing policy from DNS.

         my $policy = $dkim-&gt;fetch_author_policy;
         my $policy_result = $policy-&gt;apply($dkim);

       This method  retrieves  the  DKIM  Sender  Signing  Practices  record  as  described  in  Internet  Draft
       draft-ietf-dkim-ssp-00-01dc.  This Internet Draft is now obsolete; this method is only kept for backward-
       compatibility purposes.

       Please use the "<b>policies()</b>" method instead.

   <b>fetch_sender_policy()</b>
       Retrieves a signing policy from DNS.

         my $policy = $dkim-&gt;fetch_sender_policy;
         my $policy_result = $policy-&gt;apply($dkim);

       The  "sender"  policy  is  the  sender  signing  policy as described by the DomainKeys specification, now
       available in RFC4870(historical).  I call it the "sender" policy because it is keyed to the email address
       in the Sender: header, or the From: header if there is no Sender header.  This is  the  person  whom  the
       message claims as the "transmitter" of the message (not necessarily the author).

       If  the  email  being  verified  has  no  From or Sender header from which to get an email address (which
       violates email standards), then this method will "die".

       The result of the <b>apply()</b> method is one of: "accept", "reject", "neutral".

       See also: "<b>policies()</b>".

   <b>load()</b>
       Load the entire message from a file handle.

         $dkim-&gt;load($file_handle);

       Reads a complete message from the designated file handle, feeding it into the verifier. The message  must
       use &lt;CRLF&gt; line terminators (same as the SMTP protocol).

   <b>message_originator()</b>
       Access the "From" header.

         my $address = $dkim-&gt;message_originator;

       Returns  the "originator address" found in the message, as a Mail::Address object.  This is typically the
       (first) name and email address found in the From: header. If there is no  From:  header,  then  an  empty
       Mail::Address object is returned.

       To get just the email address part, do:

         my $email = $dkim-&gt;message_originator-&gt;address;

       See also "<b>message_sender()</b>".

   <b>message_sender()</b>
       Access the "From" or "Sender" header.

         my $address = $dkim-&gt;message_sender;

       Returns the "sender" found in the message, as a Mail::Address object.  This is typically the (first) name
       and  email  address  found in the Sender: header. If there is no Sender: header, it is the first name and
       email address in the From: header. If neither header is present, then an empty  Mail::Address  object  is
       returned.

       To get just the email address part, do:

         my $email = $dkim-&gt;message_sender-&gt;address;

       The  "sender"  is  the  mailbox  of the agent responsible for the actual transmission of the message. For
       example, if a secretary were to send a message for another person, the "sender" would  be  the  secretary
       and the "originator" would be the actual author.

   <b>policies()</b>
       Retrieves applicable signing policies from DNS.

         my @policies = $dkim-&gt;policies;
         foreach my $policy (@policies)
         {
             $policy_result = $policy-&gt;apply($dkim);
             # $policy_result is one of "accept", "reject", "neutral"
         }

       This  method  searches  for  and  returns  any signing policies that would apply to this message. Signing
       policies are selected based on the domain that the message *claims* to be from. So,  for  example,  if  a
       message  claims  to be from security@bank, and forwarded by trusted@listserv, when in reality the message
       came  from  foe@evilcorp,  this  method  would  check  for  signing  policies   for   security@bank   and
       trusted@listserv.  The  signing  policies might tell whether foe@evilcorp (the real sender) is allowed to
       send mail claiming to be from your bank or your listserv.

       I say "might tell", because in reality this is still  really  hard  to  specify  with  any  accuracy.  In
       addition, most senders do not publish useful policies.

   <b>result()</b>
       Access the result of the verification.

         my $result = $dkim-&gt;result;

       Gives the result of the verification. The following values are possible:

       pass
           Returned  if  a valid DKIM-Signature header was found, and the signature contains a correct value for
           the message.

       fail
           Returned if a valid DKIM-Signature header was found, but the signature does  not  contain  a  correct
           value for the message.

       invalid
           Returned if a DKIM-Signature could not be checked because of a problem in the signature itself or the
           public key record. I.e. the signature could not be processed.

       temperror
           Returned  if  a  DKIM-Signature  could  not be checked due to some error which is likely transient in
           nature, such as a temporary inability to retrieve a public key. A later attempt may produce a  better
           result.

       none
           Returned if no DKIM-Signature headers (valid or invalid) were found.

       In  case of multiple signatures, the "best" result will be returned.  Best is defined as "pass", followed
       by  "fail",  "invalid",  and  "none".   To  examine  the  results  of  individual  signatures,  use   the
       "<b>signatures()</b>" method to retrieve the signature objects. See "<b>result()</b>" in Mail::DKIM::Signature.

   <b>result_detail()</b>
       Access the result, plus details if available.

         my $detail = $dkim-&gt;result_detail;

       The  detail  is constructed by taking the result (e.g. "pass", "fail", "invalid" or "none") and appending
       any details provided by the verification process in parenthesis.

       The following are possible results from the <b>result_detail()</b> method:

         pass
         fail (bad RSA signature)
         fail (OpenSSL error: ...)
         fail (message has been altered)
         fail (body has been altered)
         invalid (bad identity)
         invalid (invalid domain in d tag)
         invalid (missing q tag)
         invalid (missing d tag)
         invalid (missing s tag)
         invalid (unsupported version 0.1)
         invalid (unsupported algorithm ...)
         invalid (unsupported canonicalization ...)
         invalid (unsupported query protocol ...)
         invalid (signature is expired)
         invalid (public key: not available)
         invalid (public key: unknown query type ...)
         invalid (public key: syntax error)
         invalid (public key: unsupported version)
         invalid (public key: unsupported key type)
         invalid (public key: missing p= tag)
         invalid (public key: invalid data)
         invalid (public key: does not support email)
         invalid (public key: does not support hash algorithm 'sha1')
         invalid (public key: does not support signing subdomains)
         invalid (public key: revoked)
         invalid (public key: granularity mismatch)
         invalid (public key: granularity is empty)
         invalid (public key: OpenSSL error: ...)
         none

   <b>signature()</b>
       Access the message's DKIM signature.

         my $sig = $dkim-&gt;signature;

       Accesses  the  signature  found  and  verified  in  this  message.  The  returned  object  is   of   type
       Mail::DKIM::Signature.

       In  case  of multiple signatures, the signature with the "best" result will be returned.  Best is defined
       as "pass", followed by "fail", "invalid", and "none".

   <b>signatures()</b>
       Access all of this message's signatures.

         my @all_signatures = $dkim-&gt;signatures;

       Use $signature-&gt;result or $signature-&gt;result_detail to access the verification results of each signature.
