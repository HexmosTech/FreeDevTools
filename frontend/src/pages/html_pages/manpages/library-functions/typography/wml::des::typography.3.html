</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This include file provides tags for more typographically strong layouting then HTML per default provides.
       The following tags are provided:

       <b>Typographical</b> <b>Paragraph</b> <b>Skip</b>
           <b>"&lt;ps</b> <b>"</b>[<u>height</u>]<b>"&gt;"</b>

           This is the typographical way to insert a blank line between two paragraphs. It is not as high as the
           one  generated by HTML's "&lt;p&gt;" tag. Default is 4 pixels for <u>height</u>. Optically and functionally "&lt;ps&gt;"
           is between "&lt;br&gt;" and "&lt;p&gt;".  In german this is  called  "Durchschuss",  so  you  can  also  use  the
           alterntive name "&lt;ds&gt;" for this tag.

             ...The last line of the previous paragraph.
             &lt;ps&gt;
             The new line of the following paragraph...

       <b>Typographical</b> <b>Paragraph</b> <b>Indention</b>
           <b>"&lt;pi</b> <b>"</b>[<u>width</u>]<b>"&gt;"</b>

           This  is  the  typographical way to glue paragraphs which should become one optical block. A complete
           blank line between them would be ugly and without any inserts the reader cannot  distinguish  between
           the  two  paragraphs.  The  typographical  solution  here  is to indent the second paragraph by <u>width</u>
           pixels. The default is 40 pixels.  Optically "&lt;pi&gt;" also includes the effect of  "&lt;ps&gt;".   In  german
           this is called `Einrueckung', so you can also use the alterntive name "&lt;ein&gt;" for this tag.

           Example:

             ...The last line of the previous paragraph.
             &lt;pi&gt;The new line of the following paragraph...

       <b>Big</b> <b>Paragraph</b> <b>Starting</b> <b>Letter</b>
           <b>"&lt;big</b> <b>"</b><u>X</u><b>"&gt;"</b>

           This  is  the  typographical way to mark the beginning of a more important paragraph by rendering the
           first letter of the first word of this  paragraph  in  huge  font.  Optically  this  letter  then  is
           approximately  three  times  bigger  then the normal text font. Additionally the <b>alt</b> attribute of the
           used "&lt;img&gt;" tag is set to the letter, so text-based browsers correctly show the first word.  Because
           such  a  paragraph  should also be introduced by more whitespace, one usually uses the standard "&lt;p&gt;"
           tag in front of "&lt;big&gt;" to achieve the correct optical effect.

           Example:

             ...The last line of the previous paragraph.
             &lt;p&gt;
             &lt;big T&gt;he new line of the following paragraph...

       <b>Small</b> <b>Caps</b> <b>Text</b>
           <b>"&lt;sc</b> <b>"</b>[<b>complete</b>]<b>"&gt;"</b>...<b>"&lt;/sc&gt;"</b>

           This container tag renders its body with small caps, i.e.  all lower  case  letters  are  changed  to
           upper  case  while  lowered  optically  via  font  size.  In  german typography this is also known as
           `Kapitaelchen'.  Optionally when adding the attribute <b>complete</b>, all words are forced to begin with an
           upper case letter, too.

           If you have  support  for  i18n  (internationalization)  you  may  also  convert  case  of  non-ASCII
           characters. See your local documentation <b><a href="../man7/locale.7.html">locale</a></b>(7) for details or ask your system administrator.

       <b>Spaced</b> <b>Text</b>
           <b>"&lt;spaced</b> <b>"</b>[<b>interchar=</b><u>N</u>] [<b>interline=</b><u>N</u>]<b>"&gt;"</b>...<b>"&lt;/spaced&gt;"</b>

           This  container  tag  renders  its  body as spaced text, i.e.  text with spaces between the lines and
           characters. In typpgraphy this is usually used to emphasize the text by the use  of  whitespace.  Per
           default  <b>interchar</b> and <b>interline</b> are 0, i.e. no spacing. The spacing is achieved by inserting as much
           "&amp;nbsp;" entities as <u>interchar</u> specifies and 1pt-images of height 14+<u>interline</u> every fifth word.   In
           german typography this is also known as `Gesperrt'.

       <b>Headline</b>
           <b>"&lt;headline</b> <b>"</b>[<u>name</u>]<b>"&gt;"</b>...<b>"&lt;/headline&gt;"</b>

           This  container  tag creates a typographically better headline as the standard HTML "&lt;h1&gt;" does, i.e.
           it renders the text in Helvetica and used better whitespaces around it. Actually it does  not  create
           any whitespace above it, but the correct one below it. This way you can create the leading whitespace
           your  own  (which  is  usually  different  according to the context) but get nice trailing whitespace
           (which has to be chosen carefully to make the headline and the following  paragraph  one  unit).   In
           german this is called `Ueberschrift' hence the alias "&lt;ue&gt;".

           Example:

             ...The last line of the previous paragraph.
             &lt;p&gt;
             &lt;ue&gt;The headline&lt;/ue&gt;
             The new line of the following paragraph...

       <b>Sub-Headline</b>
           <b>"&lt;subheadline</b> <b>"</b>[<u>name</u>]<b>"&gt;"</b>...<b>"&lt;/subheadline&gt;"</b>

           This  container  tag  creates a typographically better sub-headline as the standard HTML "&lt;h2&gt;" does,
           i.e. it renders the text in Helvetica and used better whitespaces around it.  Actually  it  does  not
           create  any  whitespace  above  it, but the correct one below it. This way you can create the leading
           whitespace your own (which is usually different according to  the  context)  but  get  nice  trailing
           whitespace  (which  has  to  be chosen carefully to make the headline and the following paragraph one
           unit).  In german this is called `Zwischenueberschrift' hence the alias "&lt;zwue&gt;".

           Example:

             ...The last line of the previous paragraph.
             &lt;p&gt;
             &lt;zwue&gt;The headline&lt;/zwue&gt;
             The new line of the following paragraph...

       <b>Verbatim</b> <b>Code</b>
           <b>"&lt;verbcode&gt;"</b>...<b>"&lt;/verbcode&gt;"</b>

           This container tag renders its body mostly verbatim,  i.e.   treats  it  like  plain  (source)  code.
           Internally this just is an indented "&lt;verbatim&gt;" container from <b>wml::fmt::<a href="../man3/verbatim.3.html">verbatim</a></b>(3) which itself is
           an enhanced "&lt;pre&gt;" container.

       <b>Unnumbered</b> <b>Lists</b>
           <b>"&lt;tul</b> <b>"</b>[<b>ps=</b><u>N</u>] [<b>pi=</b><u>N</u>]<b>"&gt;"</b>...<b>"&lt;/tul&gt;"</b>

           This  container  tag  displays unnumbered lists in a more typographically strong layout, rendered via
           HTML tables for indentation.

           <b>"&lt;tli</b> <b>"</b>[<b>pshape=</b><u>box</u>|<u>dash</u>] [<b>pcolor=</b><u>#rrggbb</u>]<b>"&gt;"</b>...<b>"&lt;/tli&gt;"</b>

           Items are prefixed by a box or a dash, depending on the  <b>pshape</b>  attribute,  and  its  color  may  be
           defined.
