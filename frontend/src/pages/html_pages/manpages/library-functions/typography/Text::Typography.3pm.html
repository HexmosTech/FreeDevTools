       Text::Typography - Markup ASCII text with correct typography for HTML

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Text::Typography qw(typography);

           print typography($text);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is a thin wrapper for John Gruber's SmartyPants plugin for various CMSs.

       SmartyPants is a web publishing utility that translates plain ASCII punctuation characters into "smart"
       typographic punctuation HTML entities. SmartyPants can perform the following transformations:

       •   Straight quotes ( " and ' ) into "curly" quote HTML entities

       •   Backticks-style quotes (``like this'') into "curly" quote HTML entities

       •   Dashes ("--" and "---") into en- and em-dash entities

       •   Three consecutive dots ("...") into an ellipsis entity

       SmartyPants  does  not  modify  characters within "&lt;pre&gt;", "&lt;code&gt;", "&lt;kbd&gt;", "&lt;script&gt;", or "&lt;math&gt;" tag
       blocks.  Typically, these tags are used to display text where smart quotes and other "smart  punctuation"
       would not be appropriate, such as source code or example markup.

   <b>typography($text[,</b> <b>$attributes])</b>
       Returns a string marked up with the proper HTML entities for proper typography.

       For fine grain control over what gets converted, use the $attributes option.  The default value is 3.

       The following numeric values set a group of options:

           0 : do nothing
           1 : set all
           2 : set all, using old school en- and em- dash shortcuts (-- and ---)
           3 : set all, using inverted old school en- and em- dash shortcuts (--- and --)

       For even finer control, specify a string of one or more of the following characters:

           q : quotes
           b : backtick quotes (``double'' only)
           B : backtick quotes (``double'' and `single')
           d : dashes
           D : old school dashes
           i : inverted old school dashes
           e : ellipses
           w : convert &amp;quot; entities to " for Dreamweaver users

   <b>Backslash</b> <b>Escapes</b>
       If  you  need  to  use  literal  straight  quotes (or plain hyphens and periods), SmartyPants accepts the
       following backslash escape sequences to force non-smart punctuation.  It  does  so  by  transforming  the
       escape sequence into a decimal-encoded HTML entity:

                     Escape  Value  Character
                     ------  -----  ---------
                       \\    &amp;#92;    \
                       \"    &amp;#34;    "
                       \'    &amp;#39;    '
                       \.    &amp;#46;    .
                       \-    &amp;#45;    -
                       \`    &amp;#96;    `

       This  is  useful,  for example, when you want to use straight quotes as foot and inch marks: 6'2" tall; a
       17" iMac.

   <b>Algorithmic</b> <b>Shortcomings</b>
       One situation in which quotes will get curled the wrong way is when apostrophes are used at the start  of
       leading contractions. For example:

           'Twas the night before Christmas.

       In  the  case  above,  SmartyPants will turn the apostrophe into an opening single-quote, when in fact it
       should be a closing one. I don't think this problem can be solved in  the  general  case  --  every  word
       processor  I've tried gets this wrong as well. In such cases, it's best to use the proper HTML entity for
       closing single-quotes ("&amp;#8217;") by hand.
