       regexp - Match a regular expression against a string

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>regexp</b> ?<u>switches</u>? <u>exp</u> <u>string</u> ?<u>matchVar</u>? ?<u>subMatchVar</u> <u>subMatchVar</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Determines  whether  the regular expression <u>exp</u> matches part or all of <u>string</u> and returns 1 if it does, 0
       if it does not, unless <b>-inline</b> is specified (see below).  (Regular expression matching  is  described  in
       the <b>re_syntax</b> reference page.)

       If  additional  arguments  are  specified after <u>string</u> then they are treated as the names of variables in
       which to return information about which part(s) of <u>string</u> matched <u>exp</u>.  <u>MatchVar</u> will be set to the range
       of <u>string</u> that matched all of <u>exp</u>.  The first <u>subMatchVar</u> will contain  the  characters  in  <u>string</u>  that
       matched  the  leftmost  parenthesized  subexpression  within  <u>exp</u>,  the next <u>subMatchVar</u> will contain the
       characters that matched the next parenthesized subexpression to the right in <u>exp</u>, and so on.

       If the initial arguments to <b>regexp</b> start with <b>-</b>  then  they  are  treated  as  switches.   The  following
       switches are currently supported:

       <b>-about</b>         Instead  of  attempting  to  match  the  regular  expression,  returns  a  list containing
                      information  about  the  regular  expression.   The  first  element  of  the  list  is   a
                      subexpression count.  The second element is a list of property names that describe various
                      attributes  of  the  regular  expression.  This switch is primarily intended for debugging
                      purposes.

       <b>-expanded</b>      Enables use of the expanded regular expression syntax where whitespace  and  comments  are
                      ignored.   This  is  the  same  as  specifying the <b>(?x)</b> embedded option (see the <b>re_syntax</b>
                      manual page).

       <b>-indices</b>       Changes what is stored in the <u>matchVar</u> and <u>subMatchVar</u>s.  Instead of storing the  matching
                      characters  from  <u>string</u>,  each variable will contain a list of two decimal strings giving
                      the indices in <u>string</u>  of  the  first  and  last  characters  in  the  matching  range  of
                      characters.

       <b>-line</b>          Enables  newline-sensitive  matching.   By  default,  newline  is  a  completely  ordinary
                      character with no special meaning.  With this  flag,  “[^”  bracket  expressions  and  “.”
                      never  match  newline,  “^”  matches  an empty string after any newline in addition to its
                      normal function, and “$” matches an empty string before any newline  in  addition  to  its
                      normal function.  This flag is equivalent to specifying both <b>-linestop</b> and <b>-lineanchor</b>, or
                      the <b>(?n)</b> embedded option (see the <b>re_syntax</b> manual page).

       <b>-linestop</b>      Changes  the  behavior of “[^” bracket expressions and “.”  so that they stop at newlines.
                      This is the same as specifying the <b>(?p)</b> embedded option (see the <b>re_syntax</b> manual page).

       <b>-lineanchor</b>    Changes the behavior of “^” and “$” (the “anchors”) so they match the beginning and end of
                      a line respectively.  This is the same as specifying the <b>(?w)</b>  embedded  option  (see  the
                      <b>re_syntax</b> manual page).

       <b>-nocase</b>        Causes  upper-case  characters  in  <u>string</u> to be treated as lower case during the matching
                      process.

       <b>-all</b>           Causes the regular expression to be matched as many  times  as  possible  in  the  string,
                      returning  the  total number of matches found.  If this is specified with match variables,
                      they will contain information for the last match only.

       <b>-inline</b>        Causes the command to return, as a list, the data that would otherwise be placed in  match
                      variables.   When using <b>-inline</b>, match variables may not be specified.  If used with <b>-all</b>,
                      the list will be concatenated at each iteration, such that a flat list is always returned.
                      For each match iteration, the command will append the overall match data, plus one element
                      for each subexpression in the regular expression.  Examples are:

                             <b>regexp</b> -inline -- {\w(\w)} " inlined "
                                   <u>→</u> <u>in</u> <u>n</u>
                             <b>regexp</b> -all -inline -- {\w(\w)} " inlined "
                                   <u>→</u> <u>in</u> <u>n</u> <u>li</u> <u>i</u> <u>ne</u> <u>e</u>

       <b>-start</b> <u>index</u>   Specifies a character  index  offset  into  the  string  to  start  matching  the  regular
                      expression at.  The <u>index</u> value is interpreted in the same manner as the <u>index</u> argument to
                      <b>string</b>  <b>index</b>.   When using this switch, “^” will not match the beginning of the line, and
                      \A will still match the start of the string at  <u>index</u>.   If  <b>-indices</b>  is  specified,  the
                      indices  will  be indexed starting from the absolute beginning of the input string.  <u>index</u>
                      will be constrained to the bounds of the input string.

       <b>--</b>             Marks the end of switches.  The argument following this one will be treated as <u>exp</u> even if
                      it starts with a <b>-</b>.

       If there are more  <u>subMatchVar</u>s  than  parenthesized  subexpressions  within  <u>exp</u>,  or  if  a  particular
       subexpression  in  <u>exp</u> does not match the string (e.g. because it was in a portion of the expression that
       was not matched), then the corresponding <u>subMatchVar</u> will  be  set  to  “<b>-1</b>  <b>-1</b>”  if  <b>-indices</b>  has  been
       specified or to an empty string otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Find  the  first  occurrence  of a word starting with <b>foo</b> in a string that is not actually an instance of
       <b>foobar</b>, and get the letters following it up to the end of the word into a variable:

              <b>regexp</b> {\mfoo(?!bar\M)(\w*)} $string -&gt; restOfWord

       Note that the whole matched substring has been placed in the variable “<b>-&gt;</b>”, which is  a  name  chosen  to
       look nice given that we are not actually interested in its contents.

       Find the index of the word <b>badger</b> (in any case) within a string and store that in the variable <b>location</b>:

              <b>regexp</b> -indices {(?i)\mbadger\M} $string location

       This  could  also  be  written  as  a <u>basic</u> regular expression (as opposed to using the default syntax of
       <u>advanced</u> regular expressions) match by prefixing the expression with a suitable flag:

              <b>regexp</b> -indices {(?ib)\&lt;badger\&gt;} $string location

       This counts the number of octal digits in a string:

              <b>regexp</b> -all {[0-7]} $string

       This lists all words (consisting of all sequences of non-whitespace  characters)  in  a  string,  and  is
       useful as a more powerful version of the <b>split</b> command:

              <b>regexp</b> -all -inline {\S+} $string
