       App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite - Information about SQLite

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite;

         my $sqlite = App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite-&gt;new;

         if ($sqlite-&gt;installed) {
             print "App name: ", $sqlite-&gt;name, "\n";
             print "Version:  ", $sqlite-&gt;version, "\n";
             print "Bin dir:  ", $sqlite-&gt;bin_dir, "\n";
         } else {
             print "SQLite is not installed. :-(\n";
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite supplies information about the SQLite application installed on the local system.
       It implements all of the methods defined by App::Info::RDBMS. Methods that trigger events will trigger
       them only the first time they're called (See App::Info for documentation on handling events). To start
       over (after, say, someone has installed SQLite) construct a new App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite object to
       aggregate new meta data.

       Some of the methods trigger the same events. This is due to cross-calling of shared subroutines. However,
       any one event should be triggered no more than once. For example, although the info event "Executing
       `pg_config --version`" is documented for the methods "name()", "version()", "major_version()",
       "minor_version()", and "patch_version()", rest assured that it will only be triggered once, by whichever
       of those four methods is called first.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructor</b>
       <u>new</u>

         my $sqlite = App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite-&gt;new(@params);

       Returns an App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite object. See App::Info for a complete description of argument
       parameters.

       When it called, "new()" searches the directories returned by <u>search_bin_dirs</u> for an executable with a
       name returned by "search_exe_names". If found, it will be called by the object methods below to gather
       the data necessary for each. If it cannot be found, then "new()" will attempt to load DBD::SQLite or
       DBD::SQLite2. These DBI drivers have SQLite embedded in them but do not install the application. If these
       fail, then SQLite is assumed not to be installed, and each of the object methods will return "undef".

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Looking for SQLite.

       confirm
           Path to SQLite executable?

       unknown
           Path to SQLite executable?

   <b>Class</b> <b>Method</b>
       <u>key_name</u>

         my $key_name = App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite-&gt;key_name;

       Returns the unique key name that describes this class. The value returned is the string "SQLite".

   <b>Object</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <u>installed</u>

         print "SQLite is ", ($sqlite-&gt;installed ? '' : 'not '), "installed.\n";

       Returns true if SQLite is installed, and false if it is not.

       App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite  determines  whether SQLite is installed based on the presence or absence of the
       <u>sqlite3</u> or <u>sqlite</u> application on the file system as found when "new()" constructed the object. If  SQLite
       does not appear to be installed, then all of the other object methods will return empty values.

       <u>name</u>

         my $name = $sqlite-&gt;name;

       Returns  the  name  of  the  application.  App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite  simply returns the value returned by
       "key_name" if SQLite is installed, and "undef" if it is not installed.

       <u>version</u>

         my $version = $sqlite-&gt;version;

       Returns the SQLite version number. App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite parses the version  number  from  the  system
       call "`sqlite -version`" or retrieves it from DBD::SQLite.

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Executing `sqlite -version`

       error
           Failed to find SQLite version with `sqlite -version`

           Failed to retrieve SQLite version from DBD::SQLite

           Enter a valid SQLite version number

       <u>major</u> <u>version</u>

         my $major_version = $sqlite-&gt;major_version;

       Returns  the  SQLite  major  version  number. App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite parses the version number from the
       system call "`sqlite -version`" or retrieves it from DBD::SQLite. For  example,  if  "version()"  returns
       "3.0.8", then this method returns "3".

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Executing `sqlite -version`

       error
           Failed to find SQLite version with `sqlite -version`

       unknown
           Enter a valid SQLite version number

       <u>minor</u> <u>version</u>

         my $minor_version = $sqlite-&gt;minor_version;

       Returns  the  SQLite  minor  version  number. App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite parses the version number from the
       system call "`sqlite -version`" or retrieves it from DBD::SQLite. For  example,  if  "version()"  returns
       "3.0.8", then this method returns "0".

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Executing `sqlite -version`

       error
           Failed to find SQLite version with `sqlite -version`

       unknown
           Enter a valid SQLite version number

       <u>patch</u> <u>version</u>

         my $patch_version = $sqlite-&gt;patch_version;

       Returns  the  SQLite  patch  version  number. App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite parses the version number from the
       system call "`sqlite -version`" or retrieves it from DBD::SQLite. For  example,  if  "version()"  returns
       "3.0.8", then this method returns "8".

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Executing `sqlite -version`

       error
           Failed to find SQLite version with `sqlite -version`

           Unable to parse version from string

           Failed to parse SQLite version parts from string

       unknown
           Enter a valid SQLite version number

       <u>executable</u>

         my $executable = $sqlite-&gt;executable;

       Returns the path to the SQLite executable, usually <u>sqlite3</u> or <u>sqlite</u>, which will be defined by one of the
       names returned by"search_exe_names()".  The executable is searched for in "new()", so there are no events
       for this method.

       <u>bin_dir</u>

         my $bin_dir = $sqlite-&gt;bin_dir;

       Returns  the  SQLite binary directory path. App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite simply retrieves it as the directory
       part of the path to the SQLite executable.

       <u>lib_dir</u>

         my $lib_dir = $expat-&gt;lib_dir;

       Returns the directory path in which an SQLite library was found. The directory path will be  one  of  the
       values  returned by "search_lib_dirs()", where a file with a name as returned by "search_lib_names()" was
       found. No search is performed if SQLite is not installed or if only DBD::SQLite is installed.

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Searching for shared object library directory

       error
           Cannot find shared object library directory

       unknown
           Enter a valid Expat shared object library directory

       <u>so_lib_dir</u>

         my $so_lib_dir = $expat-&gt;so_lib_dir;

       Returns the directory path in which an SQLite shared object library was found. The directory path will be
       one  of  the  values  returned  by  "search_lib_dirs()",  where  a  file  with  a  name  as  returned  by
       "search_so_lib_names()"  was  found.  No  search  is  performed  if  SQLite  is  not installed or if only
       DBD::SQLite is installed.

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Searching for shared object library directory

       error

           Enter a valid Expat shared object library directory

       <u>inc_dir</u>

         my $inc_dir = $sqlite-&gt;inc_dir;

       Returns the directory path in which an SQLite include file was found. The directory path will be  one  of
       the  values returned by "search_inc_dirs()", where a file with a name as returned by "search_inc_names()"
       was found. No search is performed if SQLite is not installed or if only DBD::SQLite is installed.

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Searching for include directory

       error

         my @search_bin_dirs = $sqlite-&gt;search_bin_dirs;

       Returns  a list of possible directories in which to search an executable. Used by the "new()" constructor
