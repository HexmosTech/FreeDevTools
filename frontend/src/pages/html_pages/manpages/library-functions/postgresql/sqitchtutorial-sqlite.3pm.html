       sqitchtutorial-sqlite - A tutorial introduction to Sqitch change management on SQLite

</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
         sqitch *

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       This tutorial explains how to create a sqitch-enabled SQLite project, use a VCS for deployment planning,
       and work with other developers to make sure changes remain in sync and in the proper order.

       We'll start by creating new project from scratch, a fictional antisocial networking site called Flipr.
       All examples use Git &lt;https://git-scm.com/&gt; as the VCS and SQLite &lt;https://www.sqlite.org/&gt; as the
       storage engine.

</pre><h4><b>Starting</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>Project</b></h4><pre>
       Usually the first thing to do when starting a new project is to create a source code repository. So let's
       do that with Git:

         &gt; mkdir flipr
         &gt; cd flipr
         &gt; git init .
         Initialized empty Git repository in /flipr/.git/
         &gt; touch README.md
         &gt; git add .
         &gt; git commit -m 'Initialize project, add README.'
         [main (root-commit) 253542e] Initialize project, add README.
          1 file changed, 37 insertions(+)
          create mode 100644 README.md

       If you're a Git user and want to follow along the history, the repository used in these examples is on
       GitHub &lt;https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch-sqlite-intro&gt;.

       Now that we have a repository, let's get started with Sqitch. Every Sqitch project must have a name
       associated with it, and, optionally, a unique URI. We recommend including the URI, as it increases the
       uniqueness of object identifiers internally, and will prevent the deployment of a different project with
       the same name. So let's specify one when we initialize Sqitch:

         &gt; sqitch init flipr --uri https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch-sqlite-intro/ --engine sqlite
         Created sqitch.conf
         Created sqitch.plan
         Created deploy/
         Created revert/
         Created verify/

       Let's have a look at <u>sqitch.conf</u>:

         &gt; cat sqitch.conf
         [core]
               engine = sqlite
               # plan_file = sqitch.plan
               # top_dir = .
         # [engine "sqlite"]
               # target = db:sqlite:
               # registry = sqitch
               # client = sqlite3

       Good, it picked up on the fact that we're creating changes for the SQLite engine, thanks to the "--engine
       sqlite" option, and saved it to the file.  Furthermore, it wrote a commented-out "[engine "sqlite"]"
       section with all the available SQLite engine-specific settings commented out and ready to be edited as
       appropriate.

       By default, Sqitch will read <u>sqitch.conf</u> in the current directory for settings. But it will also read
       <u><a href="file:~/.sqitch/sqitch.conf">~/.sqitch/sqitch.conf</a></u> for user-specific settings. Since SQLite's "sqlite3" client is not in the path on
       my system, let's go ahead an tell it where to find the client on our computer (don't bother if you're
       using the Docker image &lt;https://hub.docker.com/r/sqitch/sqitch/&gt; because it uses the client inside the
       container, not on your host machine).

         &gt; sqitch config --user engine.sqlite.client /opt/local/bin/sqlite3

       And let's also tell it who we are, since this data will be used in all of our projects:

         &gt; sqitch config --user user.name 'Marge N. O’Vera'
         &gt; sqitch config --user user.email '<a href="mailto:marge@example.com">marge@example.com</a>'

       Have a look at <u><a href="file:~/.sqitch/sqitch.conf">~/.sqitch/sqitch.conf</a></u> and you'll see this:

         &gt; cat <a href="file:~/.sqitch/sqitch.conf">~/.sqitch/sqitch.conf</a>
         [engine "sqlite"]
               client = /opt/local/bin/sqlite3
         [user]
               name = Marge N. O’Vera
               email = <a href="mailto:marge@example.com">marge@example.com</a>

       Which means that Sqitch should be able to find "sqlite3" for any project, and that it will always
       properly identify us when planning and committing changes.

       Back to the repository. Have a look at the plan file, <u>sqitch.plan</u>:

         &gt; cat sqitch.plan
         %syntax-version=1.0.0
         %project=flipr
         %uri=https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch-sqlite-intro/

       Note that it has picked up on the name and URI of the app we're building.  Sqitch uses this data to
       manage cross-project dependencies. The "%syntax-version" pragma is always set by Sqitch, so that it
       always knows how to parse the plan, even if the format changes in the future.

       Let's commit these changes and start creating the database changes.

         &gt; git add .
         &gt; git commit -m 'Initialize Sqitch configuration.'
         [main 91e2f0d] Initialize Sqitch configuration.
          2 files changed, 19 insertions(+)
          create mode 100644 sqitch.conf
          create mode 100644 sqitch.plan

</pre><h4><b>Our</b> <b>First</b> <b>Change</b></h4><pre>
       Let's create a table. Our app will need users, of course, so we'll create a table for them. Run this
       command:

         &gt; sqitch add users -n 'Creates table to track our users.'
         Created deploy/users.sql
         Created revert/users.sql
         Created verify/users.sql
         Added "users" to sqitch.plan

       The "add" command adds a database change to the plan and writes deploy, revert, and verify scripts that
       represent the change. Now we edit these files. The "deploy" script's job is to create the table. By
       default, the <u>deploy/users.sql</u> file looks like this:

         -- Deploy flipr:users to sqlite

         BEGIN;

         -- XXX Add DDLs here.

         COMMIT;

       What we want to do is to replace the "XXX" comment with the "CREATE TABLE" statement, like so:

         -- Deploy flipr:users to sqlite

         BEGIN;

         CREATE TABLE users (
                 nickname  TEXT      PRIMARY KEY,
                 password  TEXT      NOT NULL,
                 fullname  TEXT      NOT NULL,
                 twitter   TEXT      NOT NULL,
                 timestamp DATETIME  NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
         );

         COMMIT;

       The "revert" script's job is to precisely revert the change to the deploy script, so we edit this to
       <u>revert/users.sql</u> to look like this:

         -- Revert flipr:users from sqlite

         BEGIN;

         DROP TABLE users;

         COMMIT;

       Now we can try deploying this change. We tell Sqitch where to send the change via a database URI
       &lt;https://github.com/libwww-perl/uri-db/&gt;. Here we've specified a database file, <u>flipr_test.db</u>:

         &gt; sqitch deploy db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
         Adding registry tables to db:sqlite:sqitch.db
         Deploying changes to db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
           + users .. ok

       First Sqitch created the registry database and tables used to track database changes. The registry is
       separate from the database to which the "users" change was deployed; by default, its name is
       "sqitch.$suffix", where $suffix is the same as the suffix on the target database, if any. It lives in the
       same directory as the target database. This will be useful if you use the SQLite "ATTACHDATABASE"
       &lt;https://www.sqlite.org/lang_attach.html&gt; command to manage multiple database files in a single project.
       In that case, you will want to use the same file for all the databases. Keep them all in the same
       directory with the same suffix and you get just that with the default sqitch database. In this case, we
       should end up with two databases:

       •   <u>sqitch.db</u>

           The Sqitch registry database.

       •   <u>flipr_test.db</u>

           The database Sqitch manages.

       If you'd like it to have a different name for the registry database, use "sqitch engine add sqlite $name"
       to  configure  it (or via the "target" command; more below). This will be useful if you don't want to use
       the same registry database to manage multiple databases, or  if  you  do,  but  they  live  in  different
       directories.

       Next, Sqitch deploys changes to the target database, which we specified on the command-line. We only have
       one so far; the "+" reinforces the idea that the change is being <u>added</u> to the database.

       With this change deployed, if you connect to the database, you'll be able to see the schema:

               &gt; sqlite3 flipr_test.db '.tables'
               users

   <b>Trust,</b> <b>But</b> <b>Verify</b>
       But that's too much work. do you really want to do something like that after every deploy?

       Here's where the "verify" script comes in. Its job is to test that the deploy did was it was supposed to.
       It  should  do  so without regard to any data that might be in the database, and should throw an error if
       the deploy was not successful. The easiest way to do that with a table is to simply "SELECT" from it. Put
       this query into <u>verify/users.sql</u>:

         SELECT nickname, password, fullname, twitter
               FROM users
          WHERE 0;

       Now you can run the "verify" script with the "verify" command:

         &gt; sqitch verify db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
         Verifying db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
               * users .. ok
         Verify successful

       Looks good! If you want to make sure that the verify script correctly dies if the  table  doesn't  exist,
       temporarily change the table name in the script to something that doesn't exist, something like:

         SELECT nickname, password, timestamp
               FROM users_nonesuch
          WHERE 0;

       Then "verify" again:

         &gt; sqitch verify db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
         Verifying db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
           * users .. Error: near line 5: no such table: users_nonesuch
         # Verify script "verify/users.sql" failed.
         not ok

         Verify Summary Report
         ---------------------
         Changes: 1
         Errors:  1
         Verify failed

       SQLite  is  kind enough to tell us what the problem is. Don't forget to change the table name back before
       continuing!

   <b>Status,</b> <b>Revert,</b> <b>Log,</b> <b>Repeat</b>
       For purely informational purposes, we can always see how a  deployment  was  recorded  via  the  "status"
       command, which reads the tables from the registry database:

         &gt; sqitch status db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
         # On database db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
         # Project:  flipr
         # Change:   f30fe47f5f99501fb8d481e910d9112c5ac0a676
         # Name:     users
         # Deployed: 2013-12-31 10:26:59 -0800
         # By:       Marge N. O’Vera &lt;<a href="mailto:marge@example.com">marge@example.com</a>&gt;
         #
         Nothing to deploy (up-to-date)

       Let's make sure that we can revert the change:

         &gt; sqitch  revert db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
         Revert all changes from db:sqlite:flipr_test.db? [Yes]
               - users .. ok

       The  "revert"  command  first  prompts  to make sure that we really do want to revert. This is to prevent
       unnecessary accidents. You can pass the "-y" option to disable the prompt. Also, notice  the  "-"  before
       the  change  name in the output, which reinforces that the change is being <u>removed</u> from the database. And
       now the schema should be gone:

               &gt; sqlite3 flipr_test.db '.tables'

       And the status message should reflect as much:

         &gt; sqitch status db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
         # On database db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
         No changes deployed

       Of course, since nothing is deployed, the "verify" command has nothing to verify:

         &gt; sqitch verify db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
         Verifying db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
         No changes deployed

       However, we still have a record that the change happened, visible via the "log" command:

         &gt; sqitch log db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
         On database db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
         Revert f30fe47f5f99501fb8d481e910d9112c5ac0a676
         Name:      users
         Committer: Marge N. O’Vera &lt;<a href="mailto:marge@example.com">marge@example.com</a>&gt;
         Date:      2013-12-31 10:53:25 -0800

             Creates table to track our users.

         Deploy f30fe47f5f99501fb8d481e910d9112c5ac0a676
         Name:      users
         Committer: Marge N. O’Vera &lt;<a href="mailto:marge@example.com">marge@example.com</a>&gt;
         Date:      2013-12-31 10:26:59 -0800

             Creates table to track our users.

       Note that the actions we took are shown in reverse chronological order, with the revert  first  and  then
       the deploy.

       Cool. Let's tell Git to ignore <u>*.db</u> files and then commit it.

         &gt; echo '*.db' &gt; .gitignore
         &gt; git add .
         &gt; git commit -m 'Add users table.'
         [main 6725454] Add users table.
          5 files changed, 31 insertions(+)
          create mode 100644 .gitignore
          create mode 100644 deploy/users.sql
          create mode 100644 revert/users.sql
          create mode 100644 verify/users.sql

       And then deploy again. This time, let's use the "--verify" option, so that the "verify" script is applied
       when the change is deployed:

         &gt; sqitch deploy db:sqlite:flipr_test.db --verify
         Deploying changes to db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
               + users .. ok

       And now the "users" table should be back:

         &gt; sqlite3 flipr_test.db '.tables'
         users

       When we look at the status, the deployment will be there:

         &gt; sqitch status db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
         # On database db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
         # Project:  flipr
         # Change:   f30fe47f5f99501fb8d481e910d9112c5ac0a676
         # Name:     users
         # Deployed: 2013-12-31 10:57:55 -0800
         # By:       Marge N. O’Vera &lt;<a href="mailto:marge@example.com">marge@example.com</a>&gt;
         #
         Nothing to deploy (up-to-date)

</pre><h4><b>On</b> <b>Target</b></h4><pre>
       I'm  getting a little tired of always having to type "db:sqlite:flipr_test.db", aren't you? This database
       connection URI &lt;https://github.com/libwww-perl/uri-db/&gt; tells Sqitch how to  connect  to  the  deployment
       target, but we don't have to keep using the URI.  We can name the target:

         &gt; sqitch target add flipr_test db:sqlite:flipr_test.db

       The  "target"  command, inspired by "git-remote" &lt;https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote&gt;, allows management
       of one or more named deployment targets. We've just added a target named "flipr_test", which means we can
       use the string "flipr_test" for the target, rather than the URI. But since we're doing so  much  testing,
       we can also tell Sqitch to deploy to the "flipr_test" target by default:

         &gt; sqitch engine add sqlite flipr_test

       Now  we  can  omit the target argument altogether, unless we need to deploy to another database. Which we
       will, eventually, but at least our examples will be simpler from here on in, e.g.:

         &gt; sqitch status
         # On database flipr_test
         # Project:  flipr
         # Change:   f30fe47f5f99501fb8d481e910d9112c5ac0a676
         # Name:     users
         # Deployed: 2013-12-31 10:57:55 -0800
         # By:       Marge N. O’Vera &lt;<a href="mailto:marge@example.com">marge@example.com</a>&gt;
         #
         Nothing to deploy (up-to-date)

       Yay, that allows things to be a little more concise. Let's also make sure that changes are verified after
       deploying them:

         &gt; sqitch config --bool deploy.verify true
         &gt; sqitch config --bool rebase.verify true

       We'll see the "rebase" command a bit later. In the meantime, let's commit the new configuration  and  and
       make some more changes!

         &gt; git commit -am 'Set default target and always verify.'
         [main 5fb57ec] Set default target and always verify.
          1 file changed, 8 insertions(+)

</pre><h4><b>Deploy</b> <b>with</b> <b>Dependency</b></h4><pre>
       Let's  add  another change. Our app will need to store status messages from users. Let's call them -- and
       the table to store them -- "flips". First, add the new change:

         &gt; sqitch add flips --requires users -n 'Adds table for storing flips.'
         Created deploy/flips.sql
         Created revert/flips.sql
         Created verify/flips.sql
         Added "flips [users]" to sqitch.plan

       Note that we're requiring the "users" change as a dependency of the new  "flips"  change.  Although  that
       change  has  already  been  added  to  the plan and therefore should always be applied before the "flips"
       change, it's a good idea to be explicit about dependencies.

       Now edit the scripts. When you're done, <u>deploy/flips.sql</u> should look like this:

         -- Deploy flipr:flips to sqlite
         -- requires: users

         BEGIN;

         CREATE TABLE flips (
                 id        INTEGER   PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                 nickname  TEXT      NOT NULL REFERENCES users(nickname),
                 body      TEXT      NOT NULL DEFAULT '' CHECK ( length(body) &lt;= 180 ),
                 timestamp DATETIME  NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
         );

         COMMIT;

       A couple things to notice here. On the second line, the dependence on the "users" change has been listed.
       This doesn't do anything, but the default "deploy" template  lists  it  here  for  your  reference  while
       editing the file.  Useful, right?

       The  "users.nickname"  column  references  the  "users" table. This is why we need to require the "users"
       change.

       Now for the verify script. Again, all we need to do is "SELECT" from the  table.  I  recommend  selecting
       each column by name, too, to be sure that no column is missing. Here's the <u>verify/flips.sql</u>:

         -- Verify flipr:flips on sqlite

         BEGIN;

         SELECT id, nickname, body, timestamp
               FROM flips
          WHERE 0;

         ROLLBACK;

       Now for the revert script: all we have to do is drop the table. Add this to <u>revert/flips.sql</u>:

         -- Revert flipr:flips from sqlite

         BEGIN;

         DROP TABLE flips;

         COMMIT;

       Couldn't be much simpler, right? Let's deploy this bad boy:

         &gt; sqitch deploy
         Deploying changes to flipr_test
               + flips .. ok

       We  know,  since verification is enabled, that the table must have been created.  But for the purposes of
       visibility, let's have a quick look:

         &gt; sqlite3 flipr_test.db '.tables'
         flips  users

       We can also verify all currently deployed changes with the "verify" command:

         &gt; sqitch verify
         Verifying flipr_test
               * users .. ok
               * flips .. ok
         Verify successful

       Now have a look at the status:

         &gt; sqitch status
         # On database flipr_test
         # Project:  flipr
         # Change:   32ee57069c0d7fec52b6f86f453dc0c16bc1090a
         # Name:     flips
         # Deployed: 2013-12-31 11:02:51 -0800
         # By:       Marge N. O’Vera &lt;<a href="mailto:marge@example.com">marge@example.com</a>&gt;
         #
         Nothing to deploy (up-to-date)

       Success! Let's make sure we can revert the change, as well:

         &gt; sqitch revert --to @HEAD^ -y
         Reverting changes to users from flipr_test
           - flips .. ok

       Note that we've used the "--to" option to specify the change to revert to.  And what do we revert to? The
       symbolic tag @HEAD, when passed to "revert", always refers to the last change deployed to  the  database.
       (For  other  commands, it refers to the last change in the plan.)  Appending the caret ("^") tells Sqitch
       to select the change <u>prior</u> to the last deployed change. So we revert to "users", the penultimate  change.
       The  other  potentially  useful  symbolic  tag is @ROOT, which refers to the first change deployed to the
       database (or in the plan, depending on the command).

       Back to the database. The "flips" table should be gone but the "users" table should still be around:

         &gt; sqlite3 flipr_test.db '.tables'
         users

       The "status" command politely informs us that we have undeployed changes:

         &gt; sqitch status
         # On database flipr_test
         # Project:  flipr
         # Change:   f30fe47f5f99501fb8d481e910d9112c5ac0a676
         # Name:     users
         # Deployed: 2013-12-31 10:57:55 -0800
         # By:       Marge N. O’Vera &lt;<a href="mailto:marge@example.com">marge@example.com</a>&gt;
         #
         Undeployed change:
           * flips

       As does the "verify" command:

         &gt; sqitch verify
         Verifying flipr_test
           * users .. ok
         Undeployed change:
           * flips
         Verify successful

       Note that the verify is successful, because all currently-deployed changes  are  verified.  The  list  of
       undeployed changes (just "flips" here) reminds us about the current state.

       Okay, let's commit and deploy again:

         &gt; git add .
         &gt; git commit -am 'Add flips table.'
         [main 21cba95] Add flips table.
          4 files changed, 30 insertions(+)

         &gt; sqitch deploy
         Deploying changes to flipr_test
           + flips .. ok

       Looks good. Check the status:

         &gt; sqitch status

</pre><h4><b>View</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Thrill</b></h4><pre>
       One  more  thing  to add before we are ready to ship a first beta release. Let's create a view that lists
       user names with their flips.

         &gt; sqitch add userflips --requires users --requires flips \
               -n 'Creates the userflips view.'
         Created deploy/userflips.sql
         Created revert/userflips.sql
         Created verify/userflips.sql
         Added "userflips [users flips]" to sqitch.plan

       Now add this SQL to <u>deploy/userflips.sql</u>:

         CREATE VIEW userflips AS
         SELECT f.id, u.nickname, u.fullname, f.body, f.timestamp
               FROM users u
               JOIN flips f ON u.nickname = f.nickname;

       Add this SQL to <u>verify/userflips.sql</u>

         SELECT id, nickname, fullname, body, timestamp
               FROM userflips
          WHERE 0;

       And add the "DROP VIEW" statement to <u>revert/userflips.sql</u>:

         DROP VIEW userflips;

       Now Try it out!

         &gt; sqitch deploy
         Deploying changes to flipr_test
           + userflips .. ok
         &gt; sqitch revert -y
         Reverting all changes from flipr_test
           - userflips .. ok
           - flips ...... ok
           - users ...... ok
         &gt; sqitch deploy
         Deploying changes to flipr_test
           + users ...... ok
           + flips ...... ok
           + userflips .. ok

       Looks good! Commit it.

         &gt; git add .
         &gt; git commit -m 'Add the userflips view.'
         [main c74bfb4] Add the userflips view.

          create mode 100644 deploy/userflips.sql

          create mode 100644 verify/userflips.sql

</pre><h4><b>Ship</b> <b>It!</b></h4><pre>
       Now we're ready for the first development release of our app. Let's call it "1.0.0-dev1" Since we want to
       have it go out with deployments tied to the release, let's tag it:

         &gt; sqitch tag v1.0.0-dev1 -n 'Tag v1.0.0-dev1.'
         Tagged "userflips" with @v1.0.0-dev1
         &gt; git commit -am 'Tag the database with v1.0.0-dev1.'
         [main 7a479fd] Tag the database with v1.0.0-dev1.
          1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
         &gt; git tag v1.0.0-dev1 -am 'Tag v1.0.0-dev1'

       We can try deploying to make sure the tag gets picked up like so:

         &gt; mkdir dev
         &gt; sqitch deploy db:sqlite:dev/flipr.db
         Adding registry tables to db:sqlite:dev/sqitch.db
         Deploying changes to db:sqlite:dev/flipr.db
           + users ................... ok
           + flips ................... ok

       Great, both changes were deployed and "userflips" was tagged with "@v1.0.0-dev1". Let's have  a  look  at
       the status:

         &gt; sqitch status db:sqlite:dev/flipr_dev.db
         # On database db:sqlite:dev/flipr_dev.db
         # Project:  flipr
         # Change:   60ee3aba0445bf3287f9dc1dd97b1877523fa139
         # Name:     userflips
         # Tag:      @v1.0.0-dev1
         # Deployed: 2013-12-31 11:19:15 -0800
         # By:       Marge N. O’Vera &lt;<a href="mailto:marge@example.com">marge@example.com</a>&gt;
         #
         Nothing to deploy (up-to-date)

       Note the listing of the tag as part of the status message. Now let's bundle everything up for release:

         &gt; rm -rf dev
         &gt; sqitch bundle
         Bundling into bundle
         Writing config
         Writing plan
         Writing scripts
               + users
               + flips
               + userflips @v1.0.0-dev1

       Now  we  can  package the <u>bundle</u> directory and distribute it. When it gets installed somewhere, users can
       use Sqitch to deploy to the database. Let's try deploying it:

         &gt; cd bundle
         &gt; sqitch deploy db:sqlite:flipr_prod.db
         Adding registry tables to db:sqlite:sqitch.db
         Deploying changes to db:sqlite:flipr_prod.db
           + users ................... ok
           + flips ................... ok
           + userflips @v1.0.0-dev1 .. ok

       Looks much the same as before, eh? Package it up and ship it!

         &gt; rm *.db
         &gt; cd ..
         &gt; mv bundle flipr-v1.0.0-dev1
         &gt; tar -czf flipr-v1.0.0-dev1.tgz flipr-v1.0.0-dev1

</pre><h4><b>Making</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hash</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things</b></h4><pre>
       Now that we've got the basics of the app done, let's add a feature. Gotta track the  hashtags  associated
       with  flips,  right? Let's add a table for them.  But since other folks are working on other tasks in the
       repository, we'll work on a branch, so we can all stay out of each other's way. So let's branch:

         &gt; git checkout -b hashtags
         Switched to a new branch 'hashtags'

       Now we can add a new change to create a table for hashtags.

         &gt; sqitch add hashtags --requires flips -n 'Adds table for storing hashtags.'
         Created deploy/hashtags.sql
         Created revert/hashtags.sql
         Created verify/hashtags.sql
         Added "hashtags [flips]" to sqitch.plan

       You know the drill by now. Add this to <u>deploy/hashtags.sql</u>

         CREATE TABLE hashtags (
                 flip_id   INTEGER   NOT NULL REFERENCES flips(id),
                 hashtag   TEXT      NOT NULL CHECK ( length(hashtag) &gt; 0 ),
                 PRIMARY KEY (flip_id, hashtag)
         );

       Again, select from the table in <u>verify/hashtags.sql</u>:

         SELECT flip_id, hashtag FROM hashtags WHERE 0;

       And drop it in <u>revert/hashtags.sql</u>

         DROP TABLE hashtags;

       And give it a whirl:

         &gt; sqitch deploy
         Deploying changes to flipr_test
               + hashtags .. ok

       Look good?

         &gt; sqitch status --show-tags
         # On database flipr_test
         # Project:  flipr
         # Change:   1352464e8b5f3d5eeac76a1986379f07de43bffd
         # Name:     hashtags
         # Deployed: 2013-12-31 11:30:53 -0800
         # By:       Marge N. O’Vera &lt;<a href="mailto:marge@example.com">marge@example.com</a>&gt;
         #
         # Tag:
         #   @v1.0.0-dev1 - 2013-12-31 11:13:49 -0800 - Marge N. O’Vera &lt;<a href="mailto:marge@example.com">marge@example.com</a>&gt;
         #
         Nothing to deploy (up-to-date)

       Note the use of "--show-tags" to show all the deployed tags. Make sure we can revert, too:

         &gt; sqitch revert --to @HEAD^ -y
         Reverting changes to userflips @v1.0.0-dev1 from flipr_test
           - hashtags .. ok
         &gt; sqitch deploy
         Deploying changes to flipr_test
               + hashtags .. ok

       Great! Now make it so:

         &gt; git add .
         &gt; git commit -m 'Add hashtags table.'
         [hashtags 94f02b8] Add hashtags table.
          4 files changed, 28 insertions(+)
          create mode 100644 deploy/hashtags.sql
          create mode 100644 revert/hashtags.sql
          create mode 100644 verify/hashtags.sql

       Good, we've finished this feature. Time to merge back into "main".

   <b>Emergency</b>
       Let's do it:

         &gt; git checkout main
         Switched to branch 'main'
         &gt; git pull
         Updating 7a479fd..47a4107
         Fast-forward
          deploy/lists.sql | 13 +++++++++++++
          revert/lists.sql |  7 +++++++
          sqitch.plan      |  2 ++
          verify/lists.sql |  9 +++++++++
          4 files changed, 31 insertions(+)
          create mode 100644 deploy/lists.sql
          create mode 100644 revert/lists.sql
          create mode 100644 verify/lists.sql

       Hrm, that's interesting. Looks like someone made some changes to "main".  They added list support.  Well,
       let's see what happens when we merge our changes.

         &gt; git merge --no-ff hashtags
         Auto-merging sqitch.plan
         CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in sqitch.plan
         Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

       Oh,  a  conflict  in  <u>sqitch.plan</u>.  Not  too  surprising,  since  both  the merged "lists" branch and our
       "hashtags" branch added changes to the plan. Let's try a different approach.

       The truth is, we got lazy. Those changes when we pulled main from the origin should  have  raised  a  red
       flag.  It's considered a bad practice not to look at what's changed in "main" before merging in a branch.
       What one <u>should</u> do is either:

       •   Rebase the <u>hashtags</u> branch from main before merging. This "rewinds" the branch  changes,  pulls  from
           "main", and then replays the changes back on top of the pulled changes.

       •   Create  a  patch  and  apply  <u>that</u>  to main. This is the sort of thing you might have to do if you're
           sending changes to another user, especially if the VCS is not Git.

       So let's restore things to how they were at main:

         &gt; git reset --hard HEAD
         HEAD is now at 47a4107 Merge branch 'lists'

       That throws out our botched merge. Now let's go back to our branch and rebase it on "main":

         &gt; git checkout hashtags
         Switched to branch 'hashtags'
         &gt; git rebase main
         First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
         Applying: Add hashtags table.
         Using index info to reconstruct a base tree...
         M     sqitch.plan
         Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge...
         Auto-merging sqitch.plan
         CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in sqitch.plan
         Failed to merge in the changes.
         Patch failed at 0001 Add hashtags table.
         The copy of the patch that failed is found in:
            .git/rebase-apply/patch

         When you have resolved this problem, run "git rebase --continue".
         If you prefer to skip this patch, run "git rebase --skip" instead.
         To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run "git rebase --abort".

       Oy, that's kind of a pain. It seems like no matter what we do, we'll need to resolve  conflicts  in  that
       file. Except in Git. Fortunately for us, we can tell Git to resolve conflicts in <u>sqitch.plan</u> differently.
       Because  we  only  ever  append  lines  to  the file, we can have it use the "union" merge driver, which,
       according to its docs &lt;https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes#_built-in_merge_drivers&gt;:

           Run 3-way file level merge for text files, but take lines from  both  versions,  instead  of  leaving
           conflict  markers.  This tends to leave the added lines in the resulting file in random order and the
           user should verify the result. Do not use this if you do not understand the implications.

       This has the effect of appending lines from all the merging files, which is  exactly  what  we  need.  So
       let's give it a try. First, back out the botched rebase:

         &gt; git rebase --abort

       Now add the union merge driver to <u>.gitattributes</u> for <u>sqitch.plan</u> and rebase again:

         &gt; echo sqitch.plan merge=union &gt; .gitattributes
         &gt; git rebase main
         First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
         Applying: Add hashtags table.
         Using index info to reconstruct a base tree...
         M     sqitch.plan
         Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge...
         Auto-merging sqitch.plan

       Ah, that looks a bit better. Let's have a look at the plan:

         &gt; cat sqitch.plan
         %syntax-version=1.0.0
         %project=flipr
         %uri=https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch-sqlite-intro/

       Note  that  it  has appended the changes from the merged "lists" branch, and then merged the changes from
       our "hashtags" branch. Test it to make sure it works as expected:

         &gt; sqitch rebase -y
         Reverting all changes from flipr_test
           - hashtags ................ ok
           - userflips @v1.0.0-dev1 .. ok
           - flips ................... ok
           - users ................... ok
         Deploying changes to flipr_test
           + users ................... ok
           + flips ................... ok
           + userflips @v1.0.0-dev1 .. ok
           + lists ................... ok
           + hashtags ................ ok

       Note the use of "rebase", which combines a "revert" and a "deploy" into a single command.  Handy,  right?
       It  correctly reverted our changes, and then deployed them all again in the proper order. So let's commit
       <u>.gitattributes</u>; seems worthwhile to keep that change:

         &gt; git add .
         &gt; git commit -m 'Add `.gitattributes` with union merge for `sqitch.plan`.'
         [hashtags 4f93ac4] Add `.gitattributes` with union merge for `sqitch.plan`.
          1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
          create mode 100644 .gitattributes

   <b>Merges</b> <b>Mastered</b>
       And now, finally, we can merge into "main":

         &gt; git checkout main
         Switched to branch 'main'
         &gt; git merge --no-ff hashtags -m "Merge branch 'hashtags'"
         Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.

       Much much better, a nice clean main now. And because it is now identical to the "hashtags" branch, we can
       just carry on. Go ahead and tag it, bundle, and release:

         &gt; sqitch tag v1.0.0-dev2 -n 'Tag v1.0.0-dev2.'
         Tagged "hashtags" with @v1.0.0-dev2
         &gt; git commit -am 'Tag the database with v1.0.0-dev2.'
         [main 7abfd9b] Tag the database with v1.0.0-dev2.

           + userflips @v1.0.0-dev1
           + lists
           + hashtags @v1.0.0-dev2

       Note the use of the "--dest-dir" option to "sqitch bundle". Just a nicer  way  to  create  the  top-level
       directory name so we don't have to rename it from <u>bundle</u>.

</pre><h4><b>In</b> <b>Place</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       Well,  some folks have been testing the "1.0.0-dev2" release and have demanded that Twitter user links be
       added to Flipr pages. Why anyone would want to include social network links in an anti-social  networking
       app is beyond us programmers, but we're just the plumbers, right? Gotta go with what Product demands. The
       upshot  is  that  we  need  to update the "userflips" view, which is used for the feature in question, to
       include the Twitter user names.

       Normally,       modifying       views       in       database       changes       is        a        PITA
       &lt;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pita&gt;. You have to make changes like these:

       1.  Copy <u>deploy/userflips.sql</u> to <u>deploy/userflips_twitter.sql</u>.

       2.  Edit  <u>deploy/userflips_twitter.sql</u>  to  drop  and re-create the view with the "twitter" column to the
           view.

       3.  Copy <u>deploy/userflips.sql</u> to <u>revert/userflips_twitter.sql</u>.  Yes, copy the original change  script  to
           the new revert change.

       4.  Add a "DROP VIEW" statement to <u>revert/userflips_twitter.sql</u>.

       5.  Copy <u>verify/userflips.sql</u> to <u>verify/userflips_twitter.sql</u>.

       6.  Modify <u>verify/userflips_twitter.sql</u> to include a check for the "twiter" column.

       7.  Test the changes to make sure you can deploy and revert the "userflips_twitter" change.

       But  you  can  have Sqitch do most of the work for you. The only requirement is that a tag appear between
       the two instances of a change we want to modify. In general, you're going to  make  a  change  like  this
       after  a  release,  which  you've  tagged  anyway,  right? Well we have, with "@v1.0.0-dev2" added in the
       previous section. With that, we can let Sqitch do most of the hard work for us, thanks  to  the  "rework"
       command, which is similar to "add":

         &gt; sqitch rework userflips -n 'Adds userflips.twitter.'
         Added "userflips [<a href="mailto:userflips@v1.0.0-dev2">userflips@v1.0.0-dev2</a>]" to sqitch.plan.
         Modify these files as appropriate:
               * deploy/userflips.sql
               * revert/userflips.sql
               * verify/userflips.sql

       Oh,  so  we  can  edit  those files in place. Nice! How does Sqitch do it? Well, in point of fact, it has
       copied the files to stand in for the previous instance of the "userflips" change, which we  can  see  via
       "git status":

         &gt; git status
         # On branch main
         # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 4 commits.
         #   (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
         #
         # Changes not staged for commit:
         #   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
         #   (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
         #
         #     modified:   revert/userflips.sql
         #     modified:   sqitch.plan
         #
         # Untracked files:
         #   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
         #
         #     deploy/<a href="mailto:userflips@v1.0.0-dev2.sql">userflips@v1.0.0-dev2.sql</a>
         #     revert/<a href="mailto:userflips@v1.0.0-dev2.sql">userflips@v1.0.0-dev2.sql</a>
         #     verify/<a href="mailto:userflips@v1.0.0-dev2.sql">userflips@v1.0.0-dev2.sql</a>
         no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

       The  "untracked  files"  part  of  the  output  is  the  first  thing  to  notice.  They  are  all  named
       "<a href="mailto:userflips@v1.0.0-dev2.sql">userflips@v1.0.0-dev2.sql</a>". What that means is: "the "userflips" change as it was implemented as of  the
       "@v1.0.0-dev2" tag."  These are copies of the original scripts, and thereafter Sqitch will find them when
       it  needs to run scripts for the first instance of the "userflips" change. As such, it's important not to
       change them again. But hey, if you're reworking the change, you shouldn't need to.

       The other thing to notice is that <u>revert/userflips.sql</u> has changed. Sqitch replaced it with the  original
       deploy  script.  As  of  now, <u>deploy/userflips.sql</u> and <u>revert/userflips.sql</u> are identical. This is on the
       assumption that the deploy script will be changed (we're reworking it, remember?), and  that  the  revert
       script  should actually change things back to how they were before. Of course, the original deploy script
       won't be idempotent &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence&gt; -- that is, able to be  applied  multiple
       times without changing the result beyond the initial application. It could be if SQLite supported "CREATE
       OR  REPLACE VIEW", but since it doesn't, we will have to edit the script to drop the view before creating
       it. Or, more simply, it needs to be updated to revert changes back to how they were as-of the  deployment
       of <u>deploy/<a href="mailto:userflips@v1.0.0-dev2.sql">userflips@v1.0.0-dev2.sql</a></u>.

       Modify  <u>deploy/userflips.sql</u> to add the "twitter" column; in fact, let's also add a "DROP VIEW IF EXISTS"
       statement, in case we need to rework this change again in the future:

         @@ -4,8 +4,9 @@

            FROM users u

       Note that if we had included that statement  when  we  originally  created  the  "userflips"  change,  we
       wouldn't have to change this file at all.

       Now try a deployment:

         &gt; sqitch deploy
         Deploying changes to flipr_test
               + userflips .. ok

       So, are the changes deployed?

         &gt; sqlite3 flipr_test.db '.schema userflips'
         CREATE VIEW userflips AS
         SELECT f.id, u.nickname, u.fullname, u.twitter, f.body, f.timestamp
           FROM users u
           JOIN flips f ON u.nickname = f.nickname;

       Awesome, the view now includes the "twitter" column. But can we revert?

         &gt; sqitch revert --to @HEAD^ -y
         Reverting changes to hashtags @v1.0.0-dev2 from flipr_test
               - userflips .. ok

       Did that work, is the "twitter" column gone?

         &gt; sqlite3 flipr_test.db '.schema userflips'
         CREATE VIEW userflips AS
         SELECT f.id, u.nickname, u.fullname, f.body, f.timestamp
               FROM users u
               JOIN flips f ON u.nickname = f.nickname;

       Yes, it works! Sqitch properly finds the original instances of these changes in the new script files that
       include tags.

       Excellent. Let's go ahead and commit these changes:

         &gt; git add .
         &gt; git commit -m 'Add the twitter column to the userflips view.'
         [main 3eb96d9] Add the twitter column to the userflips view.
