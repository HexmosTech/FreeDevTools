</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Minion::Backend::SQLite - SQLite backend for Minion job queue

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Minion::Backend::SQLite;
         my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite-&gt;new('sqlite:test.db');

         # Minion
         use Minion;
         my $minion = Minion-&gt;new(SQLite =&gt; 'sqlite:test.db');

         # Mojolicious (via Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion)
         $self-&gt;plugin(Minion =&gt; { SQLite =&gt; 'sqlite:test.db' });

         # Mojolicious::Lite (via Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion)
         plugin Minion =&gt; { SQLite =&gt; 'sqlite:test.db' };

         # Share the database connection cache
         helper sqlite =&gt; sub { state $sqlite = Mojo::SQLite-&gt;new('sqlite:test.db') };
         plugin Minion =&gt; { SQLite =&gt; app-&gt;sqlite };

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Minion::Backend::SQLite is a backend for Minion based on Mojo::SQLite.  All necessary tables will be
       created automatically with a set of migrations named "minion". If no connection string or ":temp:" is
       provided, the database will be created in a temporary directory.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       Minion::Backend::SQLite inherits all attributes from Minion::Backend and implements the following new
       ones.

   <b>dequeue_interval</b>
         my $seconds = $backend-&gt;dequeue_interval;
         $backend    = $backend-&gt;dequeue_interval($seconds);

       Interval in seconds between "dequeue" attempts. Defaults to 0.5.

   <b>sqlite</b>
         my $sqlite = $backend-&gt;sqlite;
         $backend   = $backend-&gt;sqlite(Mojo::SQLite-&gt;new);

       Mojo::SQLite object used to store all data.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Minion::Backend::SQLite inherits all methods from Minion::Backend and implements the following new ones.

   <b>new</b>
         my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite-&gt;new;
         my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite-&gt;new(':temp:');
         my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite-&gt;new('sqlite:test.db');
         my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite-&gt;new-&gt;tap(sub { $_-&gt;sqlite-&gt;from_filename('C:\\foo\\bar.db') });
         my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite-&gt;new(Mojo::SQLite-&gt;new);

       Construct a new Minion::Backend::SQLite object.

       Wait a given amount of time in seconds for a job, dequeue it and transition from "inactive" to "active"
       state, or return "undef" if queues were empty.  Jobs will be checked for in intervals defined by
