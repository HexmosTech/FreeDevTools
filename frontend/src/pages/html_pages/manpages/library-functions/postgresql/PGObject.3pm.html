       PGObject - A toolkit integrating intelligent PostgreSQL dbs into Perl objects

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 2.4.0

</pre><h4><b>SYNPOSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To use without caching:

         use PGObject;

       To use with caching:

         use PGObject ':cache';

       To get basic info from a function

         my $f_info = PGObject-&gt;function_info(
             dbh        =&gt;  $dbh,
             funcname   =&gt;  $funcname,
             funcschema =&gt;  'public',
         );

       To get info about a function, filtered by first argument type

         my $f_info = PGObject-&gt;function_info(
             dbh        =&gt;  $dbh,
             funcname   =&gt;  $funcname,
             funcschema =&gt;  'public',
             funcprefix =&gt;  'test__',
             objtype    =&gt;  'invoice',
             objschema  =&gt;  'public',
         );

       To call a function with enumerated arguments

         my @results = PGObject-&gt;call_procedure(
             dbh          =&gt;  $dbh,
             funcname     =&gt; $funcname,
             funcprefix =&gt;  'test__',
             funcschema   =&gt; $funcname,
             args         =&gt; [$arg1, $arg2, $arg3],
         );

       To do the same with a running total

         my @results = PGObject-&gt;call_procedure(
             dbh           =&gt;  $dbh,
             funcname      =&gt; $funcname,
             funcschema    =&gt; $funcname,
             args          =&gt; [$arg1, $arg2, $arg3],
             running_funcs =&gt; [{agg =&gt; 'sum(amount)', alias =&gt; 'running_total'}],
         );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       PGObject contains the base routines for object management using discoverable stored procedures in
       PostgreSQL databases.  This module contains only common functionality and support structures, and low-
       level API's.  Most developers will want to use more functional modules which add to these functions.

       The overall approach here is to provide the basics for a toolkit that other modules can extend.  This is
       thus intended to be a component for building integration between PostgreSQL user defined functions and
       Perl objects.

       Because decisions such as state handling are largely outside of the scope of this module, this module
       itself does not do any significant state handling.  Database handles (using DBD::Pg 2.0 or later) must be
       passed in on every call.  This decision was made in order to allow for diversity in this area, with the
       idea that wrapper classes would be written to implement this.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>clear_info_cache</b>
       This function clears the info cache if this was loaded with caching enabled.

       The cache is also automatically cleared when a function that was run could not be found (this could be
       caused by updating the db).

   <b>function_info(%args)</b>
       Arguments:

       dbh (required)
           Database handle

       funcname (required)
           function name

       funcschema (optional, default 'public')
           function schema

       funcprefix (optiona, default '')
           Prefix for the function.  This can be useful for separating functions by class.

       argtype1 (optional)
           Name of first argument type.  If not provided, does not filter on this criteria.

       argschema (optional)
           Name of first argument type's schema.  If not provided defaults to 'public'

       This  function looks up basic mapping information for a function.  If more than one function is found, an
       exception is raised.  This function is primarily intended to be used by packages which extend  this  one,
       in order to accomplish stored procedure to object mapping.

       Return data is a hashref containing the following elements:

       args
           This is an arrayref of hashrefs, each of which contains 'name' and 'type'

       name
           The name of the function

       num_args
           The number of arguments

   <b>call_procedure(%args)</b>
       Arguments:

       funcname
           The function name

       funcschema
           The schema in which the function resides

       funcprefix (optiona, default '')
           Prefix for the function.  This can be useful for separating functions by class.

       args
           This  is  an  arrayref.   Each  item is either a literal value, an arrayref, or a hashref of extended
           information.  In the hashref case, the type key specifies the string to use to cast the type in,  and
           value is the value.

       orderby
           The list (arrayref) of columns on output for ordering.

       running_funcs
           An  arrayref  of running windowed aggregates.  Each contains two keys, namely 'agg' for the aggregate
           and 'alias' for the function name.

           These are aggregates, each one has appended 'OVER (ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)' to it.

       registry
           This is the name of the registry used for type  conversion.   It  can  be  omitted  and  defaults  to
           'default.'   Note  that  use  of  a non-standard registry currently does *not* merge changes from the
           default registry, so you need to reregister types in non-default registries when you create them.

           Please note, these aggregates are not intended to be user-supplied.  Please  only  allow  whitelisted
           values  here  or  construct in a tested framework elsewhere.  Because of the syntax here, there is no
           sql injection prevention possible at the framework level for this parameter.

   <b>new_registry($registry_name)</b>
       Creates a new registry if it does not exist.  This  is  useful  when  segments  of  an  application  must
       override existing type mappings.

       This is deprecated and throws a warning.

       Use PGObject::Type::Registry-&gt;new_registry($registry_name) instead.

       This no longer returns anything of significance.

   <b>register_type(pgtype</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$tname,</b> <b>registry</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$regname,</b> <b>perl_class</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$pm)</b>
       DEPRECATED

       Registers  a  type  as  a  class.   This  means that when an attribute of type $pg_type is returned, that
       PGObject will automatically return whatever $perl_class-&gt;from_db returns.  This allows you to have a  db-
       specific constructor for such types.

       The registry argument is optional and defaults to 'default'

       If  the registry does not exist, an error is raised.  if the pg_type is already registered to a different
       type, this returns 0.  Returns 1 on success.

       Use PGObject::Type::Registry-&gt;<b>register_type()</b> instead.

   <b>unregister_type(pgtype</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$tname,</b> <b>registry</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$regname)</b>
       Deprecated.

       Tries to unregister the type.  If the type does not exist, returns  0,  otherwise  returns  1.   This  is
       mostly  useful for when a specific type must make sure it has the slot.  This is rarely desirable.  It is
       usually better to use a subregistry instead.

</pre><h4><b>WRITING</b> <b>PGOBJECT-AWARE</b> <b>HELPER</b> <b>CLASSES</b></h4><pre>
       One of the powerful features of PGObject is the  ability  to  declare  methods  in  types  which  can  be
       dynamically   detected  and  used  to  serialize  data  for  query  purposes.  Objects  which  contain  a
       <b>pgobject_to_db()</b> or a <b>to_db()</b> method, that method will be called and the return value used  in  place  of
       the object.  This can allow arbitrary types to serialize themselves in arbitrary ways.

       For  example  a  date object could be set up with such a method which would export a string in yyyy-mm-dd
       format.  An object could look up its own definition and return something like :

          { cast =&gt; 'dbtypename', value =&gt; '("A","List","Of","Properties")'}

       If a scalar is returned that is used as the serialized value.  If a hashref is returned, it  must  follow
       the type format:

         type  =&gt; variable binding type,
         cast  =&gt; db cast type
         value =&gt; literal representation of type, as intelligible by DBD::Pg

   <b>REQUIRED</b> <b>INTERFACES</b>
       Registered  types  MUST  implement a $class-&gt;from_db function accepts the string from the database as its
       only argument, and returns the object of the desired type.

       Any type MAY present an $object-&gt;<b>to_db()</b> interface, requiring no arguments, and returning a valid  value.
       These can be hashrefs as specified above, arrayrefs (converted to PostgreSQL arrays by DBD::Pg) or scalar
       text values.

   <b>UNDERSTANDING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>REGISTRY</b> <b>SYSTEM</b>
       Note  that  2.0 moves the registry to a service module which handles both registry and deserialization of
       database types.  This is intended to be both cleaner and more flexible than the embedded system in 1.x.

       The registry system allows Perl classes to  "claim"  PostgreSQL  types  within  a  certain  domain.   For
       example, if I want to ensure that all numeric types are turned into Math::BigFloat objects, I can build a
       wrapper  class  with appropriate interfaces, but PGObject won't know to convert numeric types to this new
       class, so this is what registration is for.

       By default, these mappings are fully global.  Once a class  claims  a  type,  unless  another  type  goes
       through  the  trouble of unregisterign the first type and making sure it gets the authoritative spot, all
       items of that type get turned into the appropriate Perl object types.  While this is sufficient  for  the
       vast number of applications, however, there may be cases where names conflict across schemas or the like.
       To  address  this application components may create their own registries.  Each registry is fully global,
       but application components can specify non-standard registries when calling procedures, and PGObject will
       use only those components registered on the non-standard registry when checking rows before output.

       <u>Backwards</u> <u>Incompatibilities</u> <u>from</u> <u>1.x</u>

       Deserialization occurs in a context which specifies a registry.  In 1.x  there  were  no  concerns  about
       default  mappings  but  now this triggers a warning.  The most basic and frequently used portions of this
       have been kept but return values for registering types has  changed.   We  no  longer  provide  a  return
       variable but throw an exception if the type cannot be safely registered.

       This follows a philosophy of throwing exceptions when guarantees cannot be met.

       We now throw warnings when the default registry is used.

       Longer-run, deserializers should use the PGObject::Type::Registry interface directly.

</pre><h4><b>WRITING</b> <b>TOP-HALF</b> <b>OBJECT</b> <b>FRAMEWORKS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>PGOBJECT</b></h4><pre>
       PGObject  is  intended to be the database-facing side of a framework for objects.  The intended structure
       is for three tiers of logic:

       Database facing, low-level API's
       Object management modules
       Application handlers with things like database connection management.

       By top half, we are referring to the second tier.  The third tier exists in the client application.

       The PGObject module provides only low-level API's in that first tier.  The  job  of  this  module  is  to
       provide database function information to the upper level modules.

       We   do   not   supply  type  information,  If  your  top-level  module  needs  this,  please  check  out
       https://code.google.com/p/typeutils/ which could then be used via our function mapping APIs here.

   <b>Safely</b> <b>Handling</b> <b>Memoization</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catalog</b> <b>Lookups</b>
       It is important to remember, when writing PGObject top half frameworks that the catalog  lookups  may  be
       memoized  and may come back as a data structure.  This means that changes to the structures returned from
       <b>get_function_info()</b> in this module and similar functions in other catalog-bound modules may not  be  safe
       to modify in arbitrary ways.  Therefore we recommend that the return values from catalog-lookup functions
       are treated as immutable.

       Normalizing  output  is safe provided there are no conflicts between naming conventions.  This is usually
       true since different naming conventions would interfere withmapping.  However, there could be cases where
       it is not true, for example, where two different mapping modules  agree  on  a  subset  of  normalization
       conventions  but  differ on some details.  The two might safely handle the same conventions but normalize
       differently resulting in conflicts of both were used.

</pre><h4><b>A</b> <b>BRIEF</b> <b>GUIDE</b> <b>TO</b> <b>THE</b> <b>NAMESPACE</b> <b>LAYOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Most names underneath PGObject can be assumed to be top-half modules  and  modules  under  those  can  be
       generally assumed to be variants on those.  There are, however, a few reserved names:

       ::Debug is reserved for debugging information.  For example, functions which retrieve sources of
       functions, or grab diagnostics, or the like would go here.
       ::Test is reserved for test framework extensions applible only here
       ::Type is reserved for PG aware type classes.
           For   example,   one   might   have   PGObject::Type::BigFloat   for  a  Math::Bigfloat  wrapper,  or
           PGObject::Type::DateTime for a DateTime wrapper.

       ::Util is reserved for utility functions and classes.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       This  code  has  been  loosely  based  on  code  written for the LedgerSMB open source accounting and ERP
       project.  While that software uses the GNU GPL v2 or later, this is my own reimplementation, based on  my
       original  contributions  to  that  project  alone, and it differs in significant ways.   This being said,
       without LedgerSMB, this module wouldn't exist, and without the  lessons  learned  there,  and  the  great
       people who have helped make this possible, this framework would not be half of what it is today.
