</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>PARAMETER</b></h4><pre>
       â€¢ <b>level</b>: Profiling level.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MPI  libraries  themselves  make no use of this routine; they simply return immediately to the user code.
       However the presence of calls to this routine allows a profiling package to be explicitly called  by  the
       user.

       Since  MPI has no control of the implementation of the profiling code, we are unable to specify precisely
       the semantics that will be provided by calls to <u>MPI_Pcontrol</u>. This vagueness extends  to  the  number  of
       arguments to the function, and their datatypes.

       However  to  provide some level of portability of user codes to different profiling libraries, we request
       the following meanings for certain values of level:
          o    level==0 Profiling is disabled.

          o    level==1 Profiling is enabled at a normal default level of detail.

          o    level==2 Profile buffers are flushed. (This may be a no-op in some profilers).

          o    All other values of level have profile library-defined effects and additional arguments.

       We also request that the default state after <u>MPI_Init</u> has been called is for profiling to be  enabled  at
       the normal default level (i.e., as if <u>MPI_Pcontrol</u> had just been called with the argument 1). This allows
       users  to  link  with a profiling library and obtain profile output without having to modify their source
       code at all.

       The provision of <u>MPI_Pcontrol</u> as a no-op in the standard MPI library allows users to modify their  source
       code  to  obtain  more  detailed  profiling  information, but still be able to link exactly the same code
       against the standard MPI library.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This routine provides a common interface for profiling control. The interpretation of level and any other
       arguments is left to the profiling library.

       This function does not return an error value. Consequently, the result of calling it before  <u>MPI_Init</u>  or
       after <u>MPI_Finalize</u> is undefined.
