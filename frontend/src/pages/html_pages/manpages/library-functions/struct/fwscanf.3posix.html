</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fwscanf, swscanf, wscanf — convert formatted wide-character input

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/wchar.h">wchar.h</a>&gt;

       int fwscanf(FILE *restrict <u>stream</u>, const wchar_t *restrict <u>format</u>, ...);
       int swscanf(const wchar_t *restrict <u>ws</u>,
           const wchar_t *restrict <u>format</u>, ...);
       int wscanf(const wchar_t *restrict <u>format</u>, ...);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <u>fwscanf</u>() function shall read from the named input <u>stream</u>.  The <u>wscanf</u>() function shall read from the
       standard  input stream <u>stdin</u>.  The <u>swscanf</u>() function shall read from the wide-character string <u>ws</u>.  Each
       function reads wide characters, interprets them according to a format, and  stores  the  results  in  its
       arguments.  Each expects, as arguments, a control wide-character string <u>format</u> described below, and a set
       of <u>pointer</u> arguments indicating where the converted input should be stored. The result  is  undefined  if
       there  are  insufficient arguments for the format. If the <u>format</u> is exhausted while arguments remain, the
       excess arguments are evaluated but are otherwise ignored.

       Conversions can be applied to the <u>n</u>th argument after the <u>format</u> in the argument list, rather than to  the
       next  unused argument. In this case, the conversion specifier wide character <b>%</b> (see below) is replaced by
       the sequence <b>"%n$"</b>, where <u>n</u> is a decimal integer in the range [1,{NL_ARGMAX}].  This feature provides for
       the definition of <u>format</u> wide-character strings that select arguments in an order appropriate to specific
       languages. In <u>format</u> wide-character strings containing the "%<u>n</u>$" form of conversion specifications, it is
       unspecified whether numbered arguments in the argument list can  be  referenced  from  the  <u>format</u>  wide-
       character string more than once.

       The  <u>format</u>  can contain either form of a conversion specification—that is, <b>%</b> or "%<u>n</u>$"— but the two forms
       cannot normally be mixed within a single <u>format</u> wide-character string. The only exception to this is that
       <b>%%</b> or <b>%*</b> can be mixed with the "%<u>n</u>$" form. When numbered argument specifications are used, specifying the
       <u>N</u>th argument requires that all the leading arguments, from the first to the (<u>N</u>-1)th, are pointers.

       The <u>fwscanf</u>() function in all its forms allows for detection of a language-dependent radix  character  in
       the input string, encoded as a wide-character value. The radix character is defined in the current locale
       (category <u>LC_NUMERIC</u>).  In the POSIX locale, or in a locale where the radix character is not defined, the
       radix character shall default to a &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>).

       The  <u>format</u> is a wide-character string composed of zero or more directives. Each directive is composed of
       one of the following: one or more white-space wide characters (&lt;space&gt;, &lt;tab&gt;, &lt;newline&gt;, &lt;vertical-tab&gt;,
       or &lt;form-feed&gt;); an ordinary wide character (neither <b>'%'</b> nor a white-space character);  or  a  conversion
       specification.   It is unspecified whether an encoding error occurs if the format string contains <b>wchar_t</b>
       values that do not correspond to members of the character set of the current  locale  and  the  specified
       semantics do not require that value to be processed by <u>wcrtomb</u>().

       Each  conversion  specification  is introduced by the <b>'%'</b> or by the character sequence "%<u>n</u>$", after which
       the following appear in sequence:

        *  An optional assignment-suppressing character <b>'*'</b>.

        *  An optional non-zero decimal integer that specifies the maximum field width.

        *  An optional assignment-allocation character <b>'m'</b>.

        *  An optional length modifier that specifies the size of the receiving object.

        *  A conversion specifier wide character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The  valid
           conversion specifiers are described below.

       The  <u>fwscanf</u>()  functions  shall  execute  each directive of the format in turn. If a directive fails, as
       detailed below, the function shall  return.  Failures  are  described  as  input  failures  (due  to  the
       unavailability of input bytes) or matching failures (due to inappropriate input).

       A  directive  composed  of  one or more white-space wide characters is executed by reading input until no
       more valid input can be read, or up to  the  first  wide  character  which  is  not  a  white-space  wide
       character, which remains unread.

       A  directive  that is an ordinary wide character shall be executed as follows. The next wide character is
       read from the input and compared with the wide character that comprises the directive; if the  comparison
       shows  that  they  are  not  equivalent,  the directive shall fail, and the differing and subsequent wide
       characters remain unread. Similarly, if end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevents  a  wide
       character from being read, the directive shall fail.

       A  directive  that  is a conversion specification defines a set of matching input sequences, as described
       below for each conversion wide character. A conversion specification is executed in the following steps.

       Input white-space wide characters (as specified by <u>iswspace</u>()) shall be skipped,  unless  the  conversion
       specification includes a <b>[</b>, <b>c</b>, or <b>n</b> conversion specifier.

       An  item  shall  be  read  from  the  input, unless the conversion specification includes an <b>n</b> conversion
       specifier wide character. An input item is defined as the longest sequence of input wide characters,  not
       exceeding  any  specified field width, which is an initial subsequence of a matching sequence.  The first
       wide character, if any, after the input item shall remain unread. If the length  of  the  input  item  is
       zero,  the  execution  of  the conversion specification shall fail; this condition is a matching failure,
       unless end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevented input from the stream, in which case  it
       is an input failure.

       Except  in  the  case  of  a  <b>%</b>  conversion specifier, the input item (or, in the case of a <b>%n</b> conversion
       specification, the count of input wide characters) shall be  converted  to  a  type  appropriate  to  the
       conversion  wide character. If the input item is not a matching sequence, the execution of the conversion
       specification shall fail; this condition  is  a  matching  failure.  Unless  assignment  suppression  was
       indicated  by  a  <b>'*'</b>, the result of the conversion shall be placed in the object pointed to by the first
       argument following the <u>format</u> argument  that  has  not  already  received  a  conversion  result  if  the
       conversion  specification  is introduced by <b>%</b>, or in the <u>n</u>th argument if introduced by the wide-character
       sequence "%<u>n</u>$".  If this object does not have an appropriate type, or if the  result  of  the  conversion
       cannot be represented in the space provided, the behavior is undefined.

       The  <b>%c</b>,  <b>%s</b>,  and <b>%[</b> conversion specifiers shall accept an optional assignment-allocation character <b>'m'</b>,
       which shall cause a memory buffer to be allocated to hold the wide-character string converted including a
       terminating null wide character. In such a case, the argument corresponding to the  conversion  specifier
       should  be a reference to a pointer value that will receive a pointer to the allocated buffer. The system
       shall allocate a buffer as if <u>malloc</u>() had been called. The application shall be responsible for  freeing
       the  memory  after  usage.  If  there is insufficient memory to allocate a buffer, the function shall set
       <u>errno</u> to <b>[ENOMEM]</b> and a  conversion  error  shall  result.  If  the  function  returns  EOF,  any  memory
       successfully  allocated  for  parameters  using assignment-allocation character <b>'m'</b> by this call shall be
       freed before the function returns.

       The length modifiers and their meanings are:

       hh      Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, or <b>n</b> conversion specifier  applies  to  an  argument
               with type pointer to <b>signed</b> <b>char</b> or <b>unsigned</b> <b>char</b>.

       h       Specifies  that  a  following  <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, or <b>n</b> conversion specifier applies to an argument
               with type pointer to <b>short</b> or <b>unsigned</b> <b>short</b>.

       l (ell) Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, or <b>n</b> conversion specifier  applies  to  an  argument
               with type pointer to <b>long</b> or <b>unsigned</b> <b>long</b>; that a following <b>a</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>g</b>, or <b>G</b> conversion
               specifier  applies  to  an  argument  with type pointer to <b>double</b>; or that a following <b>c</b>, <b>s</b>, or <b>[</b>
               conversion specifier applies to an argument with type pointer to <b>wchar_t</b>.  If the <b>'m'</b> assignment-
               allocation character is specified, the conversion applies to an argument with the type pointer to
               a pointer to <b>wchar_t</b>.

       ll (ell-ell)
               Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, or <b>n</b> conversion specifier  applies  to  an  argument
               with type pointer to <b>long</b> <b>long</b> or <b>unsigned</b> <b>long</b> <b>long</b>.

       j       Specifies  that  a  following  <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, or <b>n</b> conversion specifier applies to an argument
               with type pointer to <b>intmax_t</b> or <b>uintmax_t</b>.

       z       Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, or <b>n</b> conversion specifier  applies  to  an  argument
               with type pointer to <b>size_t</b> or the corresponding signed integer type.

       t       Specifies  that  a  following  <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, or <b>n</b> conversion specifier applies to an argument
               with type pointer to <b>ptrdiff_t</b> or the corresponding <b>unsigned</b> type.

       L       Specifies that a following <b>a</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>g</b>, or <b>G</b> conversion specifier applies to an  argument
               with type pointer to <b>long</b> <b>double</b>.

       If a length modifier appears with any conversion specifier other than as specified above, the behavior is
       undefined.

       The following conversion specifier wide characters are valid:

       d       Matches  an  optionally  signed  decimal  integer,  whose  format is the same as expected for the
               subject sequence of <u>wcstol</u>() with the value 10 for the <u>base</u> argument. In the absence  of  a  size
               modifier, the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to <b>int</b>.

       i       Matches  an  optionally  signed  integer,  whose  format  is the same as expected for the subject
               sequence of <u>wcstol</u>() with 0 for the <u>base</u> argument.  In  the  absence  of  a  size  modifier,  the
               application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to <b>int</b>.

       o       Matches  an optionally signed octal integer, whose format is the same as expected for the subject
               sequence of <u>wcstoul</u>() with the value 8 for the <u>base</u> argument. In the absence of a size  modifier,
               the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to <b>unsigned</b>.

       u       Matches  an  optionally  signed  decimal  integer,  whose  format is the same as expected for the
               subject sequence of <u>wcstoul</u>() with the value 10 for the <u>base</u> argument. In the absence of  a  size
               modifier, the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to <b>unsigned</b>.

       x       Matches  an  optionally  signed hexadecimal integer, whose format is the same as expected for the
               subject sequence of <u>wcstoul</u>() with the value 16 for the <u>base</u> argument. In the absence of  a  size
               modifier, the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to <b>unsigned</b>.

       a, e, f, g
               Matches  an optionally signed floating-point number, infinity, or NaN whose format is the same as
               expected for the subject  sequence  of  <u>wcstod</u>().   In  the  absence  of  a  size  modifier,  the
               application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to <b>float</b>.

               If the <u>fwprintf</u>() family of functions generates character string representations for infinity and
               NaN  (a  symbolic  entity  encoded  in  floating-point  format) to support IEEE Std 754‐1985, the
               <u>fwscanf</u>() family of functions shall recognize them as input.

       s       Matches a sequence of non-white-space wide characters.  If  no  <b>l</b>  (ell)  qualifier  is  present,
               characters  from  the  input  field  shall  be converted as if by repeated calls to the <u>wcrtomb</u>()
               function, with the conversion state described by an <b>mbstate_t</b> object initialized to  zero  before
               the  first  wide  character  is  converted.  If  the  <b>'m'</b>  assignment-allocation character is not
               specified, the application shall ensure that  the  corresponding  argument  is  a  pointer  to  a
               character  array  large  enough  to accept the sequence and the terminating null character, which
               shall be added automatically.  Otherwise, the application shall  ensure  that  the  corresponding
               argument is a pointer to a pointer to a <b>wchar_t</b>.

               If the <b>l</b> (ell) qualifier is present and the <b>'m'</b> assignment-allocation character is not specified,
               the  application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to an array of <b>wchar_t</b>
               large enough to accept the sequence and the terminating null wide character, which shall be added
               automatically.  If the <b>l</b> (ell) qualifier is present and the <b>'m'</b>  assignment-allocation  character
               is  present,  the  application  shall  ensure  that  the corresponding argument is a pointer to a
               pointer to a <b>wchar_t</b>.

       [       Matches a non-empty sequence of wide characters from a  set  of  expected  wide  characters  (the
               <u>scanset</u>).   If  no  <b>l</b>  (ell)  qualifier is present, wide characters from the input field shall be
               converted as if by repeated calls to the <u>wcrtomb</u>() function, with the conversion state  described
               by  an  <b>mbstate_t</b> object initialized to zero before the first wide character is converted. If the
               <b>'m'</b> assignment-allocation character is not specified,  the  application  shall  ensure  that  the
               corresponding  argument is a pointer to a character array large enough to accept the sequence and
               the terminating null character, which shall be added automatically.  Otherwise,  the  application
               shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to a pointer to a <b>wchar_t</b>.

               If  an <b>l</b> (ell) qualifier is present and the <b>'m'</b> assignment-allocation character is not specified,
               the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to an array of  <b>wchar_t</b>
               large  enough  to  accept  the  sequence  and the terminating null wide character.  If an <b>l</b> (ell)
               qualifier is present and the <b>'m'</b> assignment-allocation character is  specified,  the  application
               shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to a pointer to a <b>wchar_t</b>.

               The  conversion  specification includes all subsequent wide characters in the <u>format</u> string up to
               and including the matching &lt;right-square-bracket&gt; (<b>']'</b>).  The wide characters between the  square
               brackets  (the  <u>scanlist</u>) comprise the scanset, unless the wide character after the &lt;left-square-
               bracket&gt; is a &lt;circumflex&gt; (<b>'^'</b>), in which case the scanset contains all wide characters that  do
               not  appear  in  the  scanlist  between  the &lt;circumflex&gt; and the &lt;right-square-bracket&gt;.  If the
               conversion specification begins with <b>"[]"</b> or <b>"[^]"</b>, the &lt;right-square-bracket&gt; is included in the
               scanlist and the next &lt;right-square-bracket&gt; is the matching &lt;right-square-bracket&gt; that ends the
               conversion specification; otherwise, the first &lt;right-square-bracket&gt; is the one  that  ends  the
               conversion  specification.  If  a <b>'-'</b> is in the scanlist and is not the first wide character, nor
               the second where the first wide character is a <b>'^'</b>, nor the last wide character, the behavior  is
               implementation-defined.

       c       Matches a sequence of wide characters of exactly the number specified by the field width (1 if no
               field width is present in the conversion specification).

               If  no  <b>l</b> (ell) length modifier is present, characters from the input field shall be converted as
               if by repeated calls to the <u>wcrtomb</u>()  function,  with  the  conversion  state  described  by  an
               <b>mbstate_t</b>  object  initialized  to  zero  before  the  first wide character is converted. No null
               character is added. If the <b>'m'</b> assignment-allocation character is not specified, the  application
               shall  ensure  that the corresponding argument is a pointer to the initial element of a character
               array large enough to accept the sequence.  Otherwise, the  application  shall  ensure  that  the
               corresponding argument is a pointer to a pointer to a <b>char</b>.

               No null wide character is added. If an <b>l</b> (ell) length modifier is present and the <b>'m'</b> assignment-
               allocation  character  is  not  specified,  the  application  shall ensure that the corresponding
               argument shall be a pointer to the initial element of an array of <b>wchar_t</b> large enough to  accept
               the  sequence.  If an <b>l</b> (ell) qualifier is present and the <b>'m'</b> assignment-allocation character is
               specified, the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to a pointer
               to a <b>wchar_t</b>.

       p       Matches an implementation-defined set of sequences, which  shall  be  the  same  as  the  set  of
               sequences  that  is  produced  by the <b>%p</b> conversion specification of the corresponding <u>fwprintf</u>()
               functions. The application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to a pointer
               to <b>void</b>.  The interpretation of the input item is implementation-defined. If the input item is  a
               value converted earlier during the same program execution, the pointer that results shall compare
               equal to that value; otherwise, the behavior of the <b>%p</b> conversion is undefined.

       n       No  input  is consumed. The application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer
               to the integer into which is to be written the number of wide characters read from the  input  so
               far by this call to the <u>fwscanf</u>() functions. Execution of a <b>%n</b> conversion specification shall not
               increment  the  assignment  count  returned  at  the  completion of execution of the function. No
               argument shall be converted, but one shall be consumed. If the conversion specification  includes
               an assignment-suppressing wide character or a field width, the behavior is undefined.

       C       Equivalent to <b>lc</b>.

       S       Equivalent to <b>ls</b>.

       %       Matches  a  single  <b>'%'</b>  wide  character;  no  conversion or assignment shall occur. The complete
               conversion specification shall be <b>%%</b>.

       If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined.

       The conversion specifiers <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, and <b>X</b> are also valid and shall be equivalent to,  respectively,  <b>a</b>,
       <b>e</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>g</b>, and <b>x</b>.

       If  end-of-file  is encountered during input, conversion is terminated.  If end-of-file occurs before any
       wide characters matching the current conversion specification (except for <b>%n</b>) have been read (other  than
       leading  white-space, where permitted), execution of the current conversion specification shall terminate
       with an input failure. Otherwise, unless execution of the current conversion specification is  terminated
       with a matching failure, execution of the following conversion specification (if any) shall be terminated
       with an input failure.

       Reaching  the  end  of  the  string  in  <u>swscanf</u>()  shall  be  equivalent to encountering end-of-file for
       <u>fwscanf</u>().

       If conversion terminates on a conflicting input, the offending input shall be left unread in  the  input.
       Any  trailing  white  space  (including  &lt;newline&gt;)  shall  be left unread unless matched by a conversion
       specification. The success of literal matches and suppressed assignments is  only  directly  determinable
       via the <b>%n</b> conversion specification.

       The  <u>fwscanf</u>() and <u>wscanf</u>() functions may mark the last data access timestamp of the file associated with
       <u>stream</u> for update. The last data access timestamp shall be marked for  update  by  the  first  successful
       execution of <u>fgetwc</u>(), <u>fgetws</u>(), <u>fwscanf</u>(), <u>getwc</u>(), <u>getwchar</u>(), <u>vfwscanf</u>(), <u>vwscanf</u>(), or <u>wscanf</u>() using
       <u>stream</u> that returns data not supplied by a prior call to <u>ungetwc</u>().

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful completion, these functions shall return the number of successfully matched and assigned
       input items; this number can be zero in the event of an early matching failure. If the input ends  before
       the first conversion (if any) has completed, and without a matching failure having occurred, EOF shall be
       returned.  If  an error occurs before the first conversion (if any) has completed, and without a matching
       failure having occurred, EOF shall be returned and <u>errno</u> shall be set to indicate the error.  If  a  read
       error occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall be set.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       For the conditions under which the <u>fwscanf</u>() functions shall fail and may fail, refer to <u>fgetwc</u>().

       In addition, the <u>fwscanf</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EILSEQ</b> Input byte sequence does not form a valid character.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> Insufficient storage space is available.

       In addition, the <u>fwscanf</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> There are insufficient arguments.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The call:

           int i, n; float x; char name[50];
           n = wscanf(L"%d%f%s", &amp;i, &amp;x, name);

       with the input line:

           25 54.32E-1 Hamster

       assigns  to  <u>n</u>  the  value  3,  to  <u>i</u>  the  value  25, to <u>x</u> the value 5.432, and <u>name</u> contains the string
       <b>"Hamster"</b>.

       The call:

           int i; float x; char name[50];
           (void) wscanf(L"%2d%f%*d %[0123456789]", &amp;i, &amp;x, name);

       with input:

           56789 0123 56a72

       assigns 56 to <u>i</u>, 789.0 to <u>x</u>, skips 0123, and places  the  string  <b>"56\0"</b>  in  <u>name</u>.   The  next  call  to
       <u>getchar</u>() shall return the character <b>'a'</b>.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       In  format  strings  containing  the <b>'%'</b> form of conversion specifications, each argument in the argument
       list is used exactly once.

       For functions that allocate memory as if by <u>malloc</u>(), the application should release such memory when  it
       is  no  longer  required by a call to <u>free</u>().  For <u>fwscanf</u>(), this is memory allocated via use of the <b>'m'</b>
       assignment-allocation character.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
