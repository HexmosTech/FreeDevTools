       explain_fchown - explain <a href="../man2/fchown.2.html">fchown</a>(2) errors

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;libexplain/fchown.h&gt;
       const char *explain_fchown(int fildes, int owner, int group);
       const char *explain_errno_fchown(int errnum, int fildes, int owner, int group);
       void explain_message_fchown(char *message, int message_size, int fildes, int owner, int group);
       void explain_message_errno_fchown(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, int fildes, int owner, int
       group);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These functions may be used to obtain explanations for errors returned by the <u><a href="../man2/fchown.2.html">fchown</a></u>(2) system call.

   <b>explain_fchown</b>
       const char *explain_fchown(int fildes, int owner, int group);

       The <b>explain_fchown</b> function is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the <u><a href="../man2/fchown.2.html">fchown</a></u>(2) system
       call.   The  least  the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it will do much
       better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (fchown(fildes, owner, group) &lt; 0)
              {
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_fchown(fildes, owner, group));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_fchown_or_die.3.html">explain_fchown_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

       <u>fildes</u>  The original fildes, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/fchown.2.html">fchown</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>owner</u>   The original owner, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/fchown.2.html">fchown</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>group</u>   The original group, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/fchown.2.html">fchown</a></u>(2) system call.

       Returns:
               The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is  shared  by  all  libexplain  functions
               which  do  not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the next call
               to any libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b> This function is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all  threads,  and  many
       other functions in this library.

   <b>explain_errno_fchown</b>
       const char *explain_errno_fchown(int errnum, int fildes, int owner, int group);

       The  <b>explain_errno_fchown</b> function is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the <u><a href="../man2/fchown.2.html">fchown</a></u>(2)
       system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errnum), but usually it will do
       much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (fchown(fildes, owner, group) &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n",
                      explain_errno_fchown(err, fildes, owner, group));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_fchown_or_die.3.html">explain_fchown_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

       <u>errnum</u>  The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just  before  this
               function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>fildes</u>  The original fildes, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/fchown.2.html">fchown</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>owner</u>   The original owner, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/fchown.2.html">fchown</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>group</u>   The original group, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/fchown.2.html">fchown</a></u>(2) system call.

       Returns:
               The  message  explaining  the  error.   This message buffer is shared by all libexplain functions
               which do not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the  next  call
               to any libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b>  This  function  is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all threads, and many
       other functions in this library.

   <b>explain_message_fchown</b>
       void explain_message_fchown(char *message, int message_size, int fildes, int owner, int group);

       The <b>explain_message_fchown</b> function may be used to  obtain an explanation of an  error  returned  by  the
       <u><a href="../man2/fchown.2.html">fchown</a></u>(2)  system  call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually
       it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (fchown(fildes, owner, group) &lt; 0)
              {
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_fchown(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), fildes, owner, group);
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_fchown_or_die.3.html">explain_fchown_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

       <u>message</u> The location in which to store the returned message.  If a  suitable  message  return  buffer  is
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>fildes</u>  The original fildes, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/fchown.2.html">fchown</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>owner</u>   The original owner, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/fchown.2.html">fchown</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>group</u>   The original group, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/fchown.2.html">fchown</a></u>(2) system call.

   <b>explain_message_errno_fchown</b>
       void explain_message_errno_fchown(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, int fildes, int owner, int
       group);

       The  <b>explain_message_errno_fchown</b>  function  may be used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by
       the <u><a href="../man2/fchown.2.html">fchown</a></u>(2) system call.  The least the message will contain is  the  value  of  strerror(errnum),  but
       usually it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (fchown(fildes, owner, group) &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_errno_fchown(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message),
                      err, fildes, owner, group);
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_fchown_or_die.3.html">explain_fchown_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

       <u>message</u> The  location  in  which  to  store the returned message.  If a suitable message return buffer is

               function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to be
