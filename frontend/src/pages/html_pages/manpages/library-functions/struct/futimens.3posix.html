       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       futimens, utimensat, utimes — set file access and modification times

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

       int futimens(int <u>fd</u>, const struct timespec <u>times</u>[2]);

       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/fcntl.h">fcntl.h</a>&gt;

       int utimensat(int <u>fd</u>, const char *<u>path</u>, const struct timespec <u>times</u>[2],
           int <u>flag</u>);

       #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;

       int utimes(const char *<u>path</u>, const struct timeval <u>times</u>[2]);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>futimens</u>()  and  <u>utimensat</u>()  functions shall set the access and modification times of a file to the
       values of the <u>times</u> argument. The <u>futimens</u>() function changes the times of the file associated  with  the
       file  descriptor  <u>fd</u>.   The  <u>utimensat</u>()  function  changes  the times of the file pointed to by the <u>path</u>
       argument, relative to the directory associated with the file descriptor <u>fd</u>.  Both  functions  allow  time
       specifications accurate to the nanosecond.

       For  <u>futimens</u>()  and  <u>utimensat</u>(),  the  <u>times</u> argument is an array of two <b>timespec</b> structures. The first
       array member represents the date and time of last access, and the second member represents the  date  and
       time  of  last  modification. The times in the <b>timespec</b> structure are measured in seconds and nanoseconds
       since the Epoch. The file's relevant timestamp shall be set to the greatest value supported by  the  file
       system that is not greater than the specified time.

       If  the  <u>tv_nsec</u>  field  of  a  <b>timespec</b>  structure  has the special value UTIME_NOW, the file's relevant
       timestamp shall be set to the greatest value supported by the file system that is not  greater  than  the
       current  time. If the <u>tv_nsec</u> field has the special value UTIME_OMIT, the file's relevant timestamp shall
       not be changed. In either case, the <u>tv_sec</u> field shall be ignored.

       If the <u>times</u> argument is a null pointer, both the access and modification timestamps shall be set to  the
       greatest  value supported by the file system that is not greater than the current time. If <u>utimensat</u>() is
       passed a relative path in the <u>path</u> argument, the file to be used  shall  be  relative  to  the  directory
       associated  with  the  file descriptor <u>fd</u> instead of the current working directory. If the access mode of
       the open file description associated with the file descriptor is not O_SEARCH, the function  shall  check
       whether  directory  searches  are permitted using the current permissions of the directory underlying the
       file descriptor. If the access mode is O_SEARCH, the function shall not perform the check.

       If <u>utimensat</u>() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <u>fd</u> parameter, the  current  working  directory
       shall be used.

       Only  a  process with the effective user ID equal to the user ID of the file, or with write access to the
       file, or with appropriate privileges may use <u>futimens</u>() or <u>utimensat</u>() with a null pointer as  the  <u>times</u>
       argument  or  with  both  <u>tv_nsec</u>  fields  set  to  the  special value UTIME_NOW. Only a process with the
       effective user ID equal to the user ID of the file or with appropriate privileges may use  <u>futimens</u>()  or
       <u>utimensat</u>()  with  a  non-null <u>times</u> argument that does not have both <u>tv_nsec</u> fields set to UTIME_NOW and
       does not have both <u>tv_nsec</u> fields set to UTIME_OMIT. If both <u>tv_nsec</u> fields are  set  to  UTIME_OMIT,  no
       ownership  or  permissions check shall be performed for the file, but other error conditions may still be
       detected (including <b>[EACCES]</b> errors related to the path prefix).

       Values for the <u>flag</u> argument of <u>utimensat</u>() are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of flags  from  the
       following list, defined in <u>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</u>:

       AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
             If  <u>path</u>  names  a  symbolic  link, then the access and modification times of the symbolic link are
             changed.

       Upon successful completion, <u>futimens</u>() and <u>utimensat</u>() shall mark the last file status  change  timestamp
       for  update, with the exception that if both <u>tv_nsec</u> fields are set to UTIME_OMIT, the file status change
       timestamp need not be marked for update.

       The <u>utimes</u>() function shall be equivalent to the <u>utimensat</u>() function with the special value AT_FDCWD  as
       the  <u>fd</u> argument and the <u>flag</u> argument set to zero, except that the <u>times</u> argument is a <b>timeval</b> structure
       rather than a <b>timespec</b> structure, and accuracy is only to the microsecond, not nanosecond,  and  rounding
       towards the nearest second may occur.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful  completion, these functions shall return 0.  Otherwise, these functions shall return -1
       and set <u>errno</u> to indicate the error. If -1 is returned, the file times shall not be affected.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> The <u>times</u> argument is a null pointer, or both <u>tv_nsec</u> values are UTIME_NOW, and the effective user
              ID of the process does not match the owner of the file and write access is denied.

       <b>EINVAL</b> Either of the <u>times</u> argument structures specified a <u>tv_nsec</u> value that was neither  UTIME_NOW  nor
              UTIME_OMIT, and was a value less than zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million.

       <b>EINVAL</b> A  new file timestamp would be a value whose <u>tv_sec</u> component is not a value supported by the file
              system.

       <b>EPERM</b>  The <u>times</u> argument is not a null pointer, does not have both <u>tv_nsec</u> fields set to UTIME_NOW, does
              not have both <u>tv_nsec</u> fields set to UTIME_OMIT, the calling process' effective user  ID  does  not
              match the owner of the file, and the calling process does not have appropriate privileges.

       <b>EROFS</b>  The file system containing the file is read-only.

       The <u>futimens</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>fd</u> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       The <u>utimensat</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> The  access  mode  of  the  open  file  description  associated  with  <u>fd</u>  is not O_SEARCH and the
              permissions of the directory underlying <u>fd</u> do not permit directory searches.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>path</u> argument does not specify an absolute path and the <u>fd</u> argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor  a
              valid file descriptor open for reading or searching.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The  <u>path</u>  argument  is  not  an  absolute path and <u>fd</u> is a file descriptor associated with a non-
              directory file.

       The <u>utimensat</u>() and <u>utimes</u>() functions shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> Search permission is denied by a component of the path prefix.

       <b>ELOOP</b>  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the <u>path</u> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT</b> A component of <u>path</u> does not name an existing file or <u>path</u> is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that is neither a directory nor  a  symbolic
              link  to  a  directory,  or the <u>path</u> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt; character and ends
              with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters and the last pathname  component  names  an  existing
              file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       The <u>utimensat</u>() and <u>utimes</u>() functions may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP</b>  More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the <u>path</u> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an
              intermediate result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       The <u>utimensat</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The value of the <u>flag</u> argument is not valid.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  purpose  of  the  <u>utimensat</u>()  function  is  to  set  the  access  and modification time of files in
       directories other than the current working directory without exposure to race conditions. Any part of the
       path of a file could be changed in parallel to a call to <u>utimes</u>(), resulting in unspecified behavior.  By
       opening  a  file  descriptor  for  the  target  directory  and  using  the <u>utimensat</u>() function it can be
       guaranteed that the changed file is located relative to the desired directory.

       The standard developers considered including a special case for the permissions required  by  <u>utimensat</u>()
       when one <u>tv_nsec</u> field is UTIME_NOW and the other is UTIME_OMIT. One possibility would be to include this
       case  in  with  the  cases  where <u>times</u> is a null pointer or both fields are UTIME_NOW, where the call is
       allowed if the process has write permission for the file. However, associating write permission  with  an
       update  to  just  the  last  data  access  timestamp  (which  is normally updated by <u>read</u>()) did not seem
       appropriate. The other possibility would be to specify that this one case is allowed if the  process  has
       read permission, but this was felt to be too great a departure from the <u>utime</u>() and <u>utimes</u>() functions on
       which  <u>utimensat</u>() is based. If an application needs to set the last data access timestamp to the current
       time for a file on which it has read permission but is not the owner, it can do so by opening  the  file,
       reading  one  or  more bytes (or reading a directory entry, if the file is a directory), and then closing
       it.
