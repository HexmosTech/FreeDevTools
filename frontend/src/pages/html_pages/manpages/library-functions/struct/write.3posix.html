       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pwrite, write — write on a file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;

       ssize_t pwrite(int <u>fildes</u>, const void *<u>buf</u>, size_t <u>nbyte</u>,
           off_t <u>offset</u>);
       ssize_t write(int <u>fildes</u>, const void *<u>buf</u>, size_t <u>nbyte</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>write</u>()  function  shall  attempt to write <u>nbyte</u> bytes from the buffer pointed to by <u>buf</u> to the file
       associated with the open file descriptor, <u>fildes</u>.

       Before any action described below is taken, and if <u>nbyte</u> is zero and the file  is  a  regular  file,  the
       <u>write</u>()  function  may detect and return errors as described below. In the absence of errors, or if error
       detection is not performed, the <u>write</u>() function shall return zero and have no other results. If <u>nbyte</u> is
       zero and the file is not a regular file, the results are unspecified.

       On a regular file or other file capable of seeking, the actual writing of data  shall  proceed  from  the
       position  in the file indicated by the file offset associated with <u>fildes</u>.  Before successful return from
       <u>write</u>(), the file offset shall be incremented by the number of bytes actually written. On a regular file,
       if the position of the last byte written is greater than or equal to the length of the file,  the  length
       of the file shall be set to this position plus one.

       On  a  file not capable of seeking, writing shall always take place starting at the current position. The
       value of a file offset associated with such a device is undefined.

       If the O_APPEND flag of the file status flags is set, the file offset shall be set to the end of the file
       prior to each write and no intervening file modification operation shall occur between changing the  file
       offset and the write operation.

       If a <u>write</u>() requests that more bytes be written than there is room for (for example, the file size limit
       of  the  process  or  the  physical  end  of  a medium), only as many bytes as there is room for shall be
       written. For example, suppose there is space for 20 bytes more in a file before reaching a limit. A write
       of 512 bytes will return 20. The next write of a non-zero number of bytes would  give  a  failure  return
       (except as noted below).

       If  the request would cause the file size to exceed the soft file size limit for the process and there is
       no room for any bytes to be written, the request shall fail and the  implementation  shall  generate  the
       SIGXFSZ signal for the thread.

       If  <u>write</u>()  is  interrupted  by a signal before it writes any data, it shall return -1 with <u>errno</u> set to
       <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       If <u>write</u>() is interrupted by a signal after it successfully writes some data, it shall return the  number
       of bytes written.

       If the value of <u>nbyte</u> is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result is implementation-defined.

       After a <u>write</u>() to a regular file has successfully returned:

        *  Any  successful  <u>read</u>()  from  each  byte  position in the file that was modified by that write shall
           return the data specified by the <u>write</u>() for that  position  until  such  byte  positions  are  again
           modified.

        *  Any  subsequent  successful  <u>write</u>()  to the same byte position in the file shall overwrite that file
           data.

       Write requests to a pipe or FIFO shall be handled in the same way as a regular file  with  the  following
       exceptions:

        *  There  is  no file offset associated with a pipe, hence each write request shall append to the end of
           the pipe.

        *  Write requests of {PIPE_BUF} bytes or less shall not be interleaved with data  from  other  processes
           doing  writes on the same pipe. Writes of greater than {PIPE_BUF} bytes may have data interleaved, on
           arbitrary boundaries, with writes by other processes, whether or not the O_NONBLOCK flag of the  file
           status flags is set.

        *  If  the  O_NONBLOCK  flag  is  clear,  a  write  request may cause the thread to block, but on normal
           completion it shall return <u>nbyte</u>.

        *  If the O_NONBLOCK flag is set, <u>write</u>() requests shall be handled differently, in the following ways:

           --  The <u>write</u>() function shall not block the thread.

           --  A write request for {PIPE_BUF} or fewer bytes shall  have  the  following  effect:  if  there  is
               sufficient space available in the pipe, <u>write</u>() shall transfer all the data and return the number
               of  bytes  requested.   Otherwise, <u>write</u>() shall transfer no data and return -1 with <u>errno</u> set to
               <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.

           --  A write request for more than {PIPE_BUF} bytes shall cause one of the following:

               --  When at least one byte can be written, transfer what it can and return the  number  of  bytes
                   written.  When  all  data  previously written to the pipe is read, it shall transfer at least
                   {PIPE_BUF} bytes.

               --  When no data can be written, transfer no data, and return -1 with <u>errno</u> set to <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.

       When attempting to write to a file descriptor (other than a pipe  or  FIFO)  that  supports  non-blocking
       writes and cannot accept the data immediately:

        *  If  the  O_NONBLOCK  flag  is  clear,  <u>write</u>()  shall  block the calling thread until the data can be
           accepted.

        *  If the O_NONBLOCK flag is set, <u>write</u>() shall not block the  thread.  If  some  data  can  be  written
           without  blocking the thread, <u>write</u>() shall write what it can and return the number of bytes written.
           Otherwise, it shall return -1 and set <u>errno</u> to <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.

       Upon successful completion, where <u>nbyte</u> is greater than 0, <u>write</u>() shall mark for update  the  last  data
       modification  and  last file status change timestamps of the file, and if the file is a regular file, the
       S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits of the file mode may be cleared.

       For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset maximum  established  in  the  open  file
       description associated with <u>fildes</u>.

       If <u>fildes</u> refers to a socket, <u>write</u>() shall be equivalent to <u>send</u>() with no flags set.

       If the O_DSYNC bit has been set, write I/O operations on the file descriptor shall complete as defined by
       synchronized I/O data integrity completion.

       If  the O_SYNC bit has been set, write I/O operations on the file descriptor shall complete as defined by
       synchronized I/O file integrity completion.

       If <u>fildes</u> refers to a shared memory object, the result of the <u>write</u>() function is unspecified.

       If <u>fildes</u> refers to a typed memory object, the result of the <u>write</u>() function is unspecified.

       If <u>fildes</u> refers to a STREAM, the operation of <u>write</u>() shall be determined by the values of  the  minimum
       and  maximum <u>nbyte</u> range (packet size) accepted by the STREAM. These values are determined by the topmost
       STREAM module. If <u>nbyte</u> falls within the packet size range, <u>nbyte</u> bytes shall be written. If  <u>nbyte</u>  does
       not  fall  within  the  range and the minimum packet size value is 0, <u>write</u>() shall break the buffer into
       maximum packet size segments prior to sending the data downstream (the last segment may contain less than
       the maximum packet size). If <u>nbyte</u> does not fall within the range and  the  minimum  value  is  non-zero,
       <u>write</u>()  shall  fail  with <u>errno</u> set to <b>[ERANGE]</b>.  Writing a zero-length buffer (<u>nbyte</u> is 0) to a STREAMS
       device sends 0 bytes with 0 returned. However, writing a zero-length buffer to a  STREAMS-based  pipe  or
       FIFO  sends  no  message  and 0 is returned. The process may issue I_SWROPT <u>ioctl</u>() to enable zero-length
       messages to be sent across the pipe or FIFO.

       When writing to a STREAM, data messages are created with a priority band of 0. When writing to  a  STREAM
       that is not a pipe or FIFO:

        *  If  O_NONBLOCK  is  clear,  and  the STREAM cannot accept data (the STREAM write queue is full due to
           internal flow control conditions), <u>write</u>() shall block until data can be accepted.

        *  If O_NONBLOCK is set and the STREAM cannot accept data, <u>write</u>() shall return  -1  and  set  <u>errno</u>  to
           <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.

        *  If  O_NONBLOCK  is  set and part of the buffer has been written while a condition in which the STREAM
           cannot accept additional data occurs, <u>write</u>() shall terminate and return the number of bytes written.

       In addition, <u>write</u>() shall fail if the STREAM head has processed an asynchronous error before  the  call.
       In this case, the value of <u>errno</u> does not reflect the result of <u>write</u>(), but reflects the prior error.

       The  <u>pwrite</u>()  function  shall  be equivalent to <u>write</u>(), except that it writes into a given position and
       does not change the file offset (regardless of whether O_APPEND is set). The  first  three  arguments  to
       <u>pwrite</u>()  are  the same as <u>write</u>() with the addition of a fourth argument <u>offset</u> for the desired position
       inside the file. An attempt to perform a <u>pwrite</u>() on a file that is incapable of seeking shall result  in
       an error.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the number of bytes actually written to the file
       associated  with <u>fildes</u>.  This number shall never be greater than <u>nbyte</u>.  Otherwise, -1 shall be returned
       and <u>errno</u> set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> The file is neither a pipe, nor a FIFO, nor a socket, the O_NONBLOCK flag  is  set  for  the  file
              descriptor, and the thread would be delayed in the <u>write</u>() operation.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>fildes</u> argument is not a valid file descriptor open for writing.

       <b>EFBIG</b>  An  attempt  was made to write a file that exceeds the implementation-defined maximum file size or
              the file size limit of the process, and there was no room for any bytes to be written.

       <b>EFBIG</b>  The file is a regular file, <u>nbyte</u> is greater than 0, and the starting position is greater than  or
              equal to the offset maximum established in the open file description associated with <u>fildes</u>.

       <b>EINTR</b>  The write operation was terminated due to the receipt of a signal, and no data was transferred.

       <b>EIO</b>    The  process  is  a  member  of  a background process group attempting to write to its controlling
              terminal, TOSTOP is set, the calling thread is not blocking SIGTTOU, the process is  not  ignoring
              SIGTTOU,  and  the process group of the process is orphaned. This error may also be returned under
              implementation-defined conditions.

       <b>ENOSPC</b> There was no free space remaining on the device containing the file.

       <b>ERANGE</b> The transfer request size was outside the range supported by  the  STREAMS  file  associated  with
              <u>fildes</u>.

       The <u>pwrite</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The  file  is  a regular file or block special file, and the <u>offset</u> argument is negative. The file
              offset shall remain unchanged.

       <b>ESPIPE</b> The file is incapable of seeking.

       The <u>write</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> The file is a pipe or FIFO, the O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file  descriptor,  and  the  thread
              would be delayed in the write operation.

       <b>EAGAIN</b> or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              The  file is a socket, the O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor, and the thread would be
              delayed in the write operation.

       <b>ECONNRESET</b>
              A write was attempted on a socket that is not connected.

       <b>EPIPE</b>  An attempt is made to write to a pipe or FIFO that is not open for reading by any process, or that
              only has one end open. A SIGPIPE signal shall also be sent to the thread.

       <b>EPIPE</b>  A write was attempted on a socket that is shut down for writing, or is no longer connected. In the
              latter case, if the socket is of type SOCK_STREAM, a SIGPIPE signal shall  also  be  sent  to  the
              thread.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The  STREAM or multiplexer referenced by <u>fildes</u> is linked (directly or indirectly) downstream from
              a multiplexer.

       <b>EIO</b>    A physical I/O error has occurred.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform the operation.

       <b>ENXIO</b>  A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside  the  capabilities  of  the
              device.

       <b>ENXIO</b>  A hangup occurred on the STREAM being written to.

       A  write  to  a  STREAMS  file may fail if an error message has been received at the STREAM head. In this
       case, <u>errno</u> is set to the value included in the error message.

       The <u>write</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> A write was attempted on a socket and the calling process does not have appropriate privileges.

       <b>ENETDOWN</b>
              A write was attempted on a socket and the local network interface used to reach the destination is
              down.

       <b>ENETUNREACH</b>
              A write was attempted on a socket and no route to the network is present.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Writing</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>Buffer</b>
       The following example writes data from the buffer pointed to by <u>buf</u> to the file associated with the  file
       descriptor <u>fd</u>.

           #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/string.h">string.h</a>&gt;
           ...
           char buf[20];
           size_t nbytes;

           int fd;
           ...
           strcpy(buf, "This is a test\n");
           nbytes = strlen(buf);

           bytes_written = write(fd, buf, nbytes);
           ...

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       See also the RATIONALE section in <u>read</u>().

       An attempt to write to a pipe or FIFO has several major characteristics:

        *  <u>Atomic/non-atomic</u>:  A write is atomic if the whole amount written in one operation is not interleaved
           with data from any other process.  This is useful when there are multiple writers sending data  to  a
           single  reader.  Applications  need to know how large a write request can be expected to be performed
           atomically. This maximum is called {PIPE_BUF}.  This volume of  POSIX.1‐2017  does  not  say  whether
           write  requests  for more than {PIPE_BUF} bytes are atomic, but requires that writes of {PIPE_BUF} or
           fewer bytes shall be atomic.

        *  <u>Blocking/immediate</u>: Blocking is only possible with O_NONBLOCK clear. If there is enough space for all
           the data requested to be written immediately, the implementation should do so. Otherwise, the calling
           thread may block; that is, pause until enough space is available for writing. The effective size of a
           pipe or FIFO (the maximum amount that can be written in one  operation  without  blocking)  may  vary
           dynamically, depending on the implementation, so it is not possible to specify a fixed value for it.

        *  <u>Complete/partial/deferred</u>: A write request:

               int fildes;
               size_t nbyte;
               ssize_t ret;
               char *buf;

               ret = write(fildes, buf, nbyte);

           may return:

           Complete  <u>ret</u>=<u>nbyte</u>

           Partial   <u>ret</u>&lt;<u>nbyte</u>

                     This  shall  never  happen if <u>nbyte</u>≤{PIPE_BUF}.  If it does happen (with <u>nbyte</u>&gt;{PIPE_BUF}),
                     this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not guarantee atomicity, even if  <u>ret</u>≤{PIPE_BUF},  because
                     atomicity is guaranteed according to the amount <u>requested</u>, not the amount <u>written</u>.

           Deferred: <u>ret</u>=-1, <u>errno</u>=[EAGAIN]

                     This  error  indicates that a later request may succeed. It does not indicate that it <u>shall</u>
                     succeed, even if <u>nbyte</u>≤{PIPE_BUF}, because if no process reads from the pipe or  FIFO,  the
                     write  never  succeeds. An application could usefully count the number of times <b>[EAGAIN]</b> is
                     caused by a particular value of <u>nbyte</u>&gt;{PIPE_BUF} and perhaps do later writes with a smaller
                     value, on the assumption that the effective size of the pipe may have decreased.

           Partial and deferred writes are only possible with O_NONBLOCK set.

       The relations of these properties are shown in the following tables:
                      ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                      │             <b>Write</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Pipe</b> <b>or</b> <b>FIFO</b> <b>with</b> <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> <u>clear</u>              │

       If the O_NONBLOCK flag is clear, a write request shall block if the amount writable immediately  is  less
       than that requested. If the flag is set (by <u>fcntl</u>()), a write request shall never block.

       There  is no exception regarding partial writes when O_NONBLOCK is set.  With the exception of writing to
       an empty pipe, this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify exactly when a  partial  write  is  performed
       since  that  would require specifying internal details of the implementation. Every application should be
       prepared to handle partial writes when O_NONBLOCK is  set  and  the  requested  amount  is  greater  than
       {PIPE_BUF},  just as every application should be prepared to handle partial writes on other kinds of file
       descriptors.

       The intent of forcing writing at least one byte if any can be written is to assure that each write  makes
       progress  if  there  is  any room in the pipe. If the pipe is empty, {PIPE_BUF} bytes must be written; if
       not, at least some progress must have been made.

       Where this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires -1 to be returned and <u>errno</u> set to <b>[EAGAIN]</b>,  most  historical
       implementations  return  zero  (with  the  O_NDELAY  flag  set,  which  is  the historical predecessor of
       O_NONBLOCK, but is not itself in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017). The error indications in  this  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017  were  chosen  so  that  an  application can distinguish these cases from end-of-file. While
       <u>write</u>() cannot receive an indication of end-of-file, <u>read</u>() can,  and  the  two  functions  have  similar
       return  values. Also, some existing systems (for example, Eighth Edition) permit a write of zero bytes to
       mean that the reader should get an end-of-file indication; for those systems, a return value of zero from
       <u>write</u>() indicates a successful write of an end-of-file indication.

       Implementations are allowed, but not required, to perform error checking for  <u>write</u>()  requests  of  zero
       bytes.

       The  concept  of a {PIPE_MAX} limit (indicating the maximum number of bytes that can be written to a pipe
       in a single operation) was considered, but rejected,  because  this  concept  would  unnecessarily  limit
       application writing.

       See also the discussion of O_NONBLOCK in <u>read</u>().

       Writes  can  be serialized with respect to other reads and writes. If a <u>read</u>() of file data can be proven
       (by any means) to occur after a <u>write</u>() of the data, it must reflect that <u>write</u>(), even if the calls  are
       made  by different processes. A similar requirement applies to multiple write operations to the same file
       position. This is needed to guarantee the propagation of data from <u>write</u>()  calls  to  subsequent  <u>read</u>()
       calls.  This  requirement  is  particularly  significant  for  networked file systems, where some caching
       schemes violate these semantics.

       Note that this is specified in terms of <u>read</u>() and <u>write</u>().  The XSI extensions <u>readv</u>() and <u>writev</u>() also
       obey these semantics. A new ``high-performance'' write analog that did  not  follow  these  serialization
       requirements  would  also  be permitted by this wording. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 is also silent about
       any effects of application-level caching (such as that done by <u>stdio</u>).

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify the value of the file offset after  an  error  is  returned;
       there  are  too  many cases. For programming errors, such as <b>[EBADF]</b>, the concept is meaningless since no
       file is involved. For errors that are detected immediately, such as <b>[EAGAIN]</b>, clearly the pointer  should
       not  change.  After an interrupt or hardware error, however, an updated value would be very useful and is
       the behavior of many implementations.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify the behavior of concurrent writes to  a  regular  file  from
       multiple  threads,  except that each write is atomic (see <u>Section</u> <u>2.9.7</u>, <u>Thread</u> <u>Interactions</u> <u>with</u> <u>Regular</u>
       <u>File</u> <u>Operations</u>).  Applications should use some form of concurrency control.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 intentionally does not specify any <u>pwrite</u>() errors related to  pipes,  FIFOs,
       and sockets other than <b>[ESPIPE]</b>.
