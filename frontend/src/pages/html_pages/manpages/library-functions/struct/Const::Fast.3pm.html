</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Const::Fast - Facility for creating read-only scalars, arrays, and hashes

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.014

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Const::Fast;

        const my $foo =&gt; 'a scalar value';
        const my @bar =&gt; qw/a list value/;
        const my %buz =&gt; (a =&gt; 'hash', of =&gt; 'something');

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES/METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>const</b> <b>$var,</b> <b>$value</b>
   <b>const</b> <b>@var,</b> <b>@value...</b>
   <b>const</b> <b>%var,</b> <b>%value...</b>
       This the only function of this module and it is exported by default. It takes a scalar, array or hash
       lvalue as first argument, and a list of one or more values depending on the type of the first argument as
       the value for the variable. It will set the variable to that value and subsequently make it readonly.
       Arrays and hashes will be made deeply readonly.

       Exporting is done using Sub::Exporter::Progressive. You may need to depend on Sub::Exporter explicitly if
       you need the latter's flexibility.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       This module was written because I stumbled on some serious issues of Readonly that aren't easily fixable
       without breaking backwards compatibility in subtle ways. In particular Readonly's use of ties is a source
       of subtle bugs and bad performance. Instead, this module uses the builtin readonly feature of perl,
       making access to the variables just as fast as any normal variable without the weird side-effects of
       ties. Readonly can do the same for scalars when Readonly::XS is installed, but chooses not to do so in
       the most common case. This may change in the future if someone takes up maintenance of Readonly, and the
       two modules may be convergence if that happens.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Perl doesn't distinguish between restricted hashes and readonly hashes. This means that:

        use Const::Fast;
        const my %a =&gt; (foo =&gt; 1, bar =&gt; 2);
        say 1 unless $a{baz}

       Will give the error "Attempt to access disallowed key 'baz' in a restricted hash". You have to use
       "exists $a{baz}" instead. This is a limitation of perl that can hopefully be solved in the future.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The interface for this module was inspired by Eric Roode's Readonly. The implementation is inspired by
       doing everything the opposite way Readonly does it.
