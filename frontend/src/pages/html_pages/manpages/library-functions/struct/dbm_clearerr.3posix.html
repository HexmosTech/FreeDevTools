       int dbm_clearerr(DBM *<u>db</u>);
       void dbm_close(DBM *<u>db</u>);
       int dbm_delete(DBM *<u>db</u>, datum <u>key</u>);
       int dbm_error(DBM *<u>db</u>);
       datum dbm_fetch(DBM *<u>db</u>, datum <u>key</u>);
       datum dbm_firstkey(DBM *<u>db</u>);
       datum dbm_nextkey(DBM *<u>db</u>);
       DBM *dbm_open(const char *<u>file</u>, int <u>open_flags</u>, mode_t <u>file_mode</u>);
       int dbm_store(DBM *<u>db</u>, datum <u>key</u>, datum <u>content</u>, int <u>store_mode</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These functions create, access, and modify a database.

       A  <b>datum</b>  consists  of at least two members, <u>dptr</u> and <u>dsize</u>.  The <u>dptr</u> member points to an object that is
       <u>dsize</u> bytes in length. Arbitrary binary data, as well as character strings, may be stored in  the  object
       pointed to by <u>dptr</u>.

       A  database  shall  be  stored  in one or two files. When one file is used, the name of the database file
       shall be formed by appending the suffix <b>.db</b> to the <u>file</u> argument given to <u>dbm_open</u>().  When two files are
       used, the names of the  database  files  shall  be  formed  by  appending  the  suffixes  <b>.dir</b>  and  <b>.pag</b>
       respectively to the <u>file</u> argument.

       The  <u>dbm_open</u>()  function shall open a database. The <u>file</u> argument to the function is the pathname of the
       database. The <u>open_flags</u> argument has the same meaning as the <u>flags</u> argument  of  <u>open</u>()  except  that  a
       database  opened  for write-only access opens the files for read and write access and the behavior of the
       O_APPEND flag is unspecified. The <u>file_mode</u> argument has the  same  meaning  as  the  third  argument  of
       <u>open</u>().

       The  <u>dbm_open</u>()  function  need  not  accept  pathnames  longer  than  {PATH_MAX}-4  bytes (including the
       terminating null), or pathnames with a last component  longer  than  {NAME_MAX}-4  bytes  (excluding  the
       terminating null).

       The  <u>dbm_close</u>()  function  shall  close  a  database. The application shall ensure that argument <u>db</u> is a
       pointer to a <b>dbm</b> structure that has been returned from a call to <u>dbm_open</u>().

       These database functions shall support an internal block size large enough to support  key/content  pairs
       of at least 1023 bytes.

       The  <u>dbm_fetch</u>() function shall read a record from a database. The argument <u>db</u> is a pointer to a database
       structure that has been returned from a call to <u>dbm_open</u>().  The argument <u>key</u> is a <b>datum</b>  that  has  been
       initialized  by the application to the value of the key that matches the key of the record the program is
       fetching.

       The <u>dbm_store</u>() function shall write a record to a database. The argument <u>db</u> is a pointer to  a  database
       structure  that  has  been returned from a call to <u>dbm_open</u>().  The argument <u>key</u> is a <b>datum</b> that has been
       initialized by the application to the value of the key that identifies (for subsequent reading,  writing,
       or  deleting)  the  record  the  application  is  writing.  The argument <u>content</u> is a <b>datum</b> that has been
       initialized by the application to the value of the record the program is writing. The argument <u>store_mode</u>
       controls whether <u>dbm_store</u>() replaces any pre-existing record that has the same key that is specified  by
       the  <u>key</u>  argument.  The  application  shall  set  <u>store_mode</u> to either DBM_INSERT or DBM_REPLACE. If the
       database contains a record that matches the <u>key</u> argument and  <u>store_mode</u>  is  DBM_REPLACE,  the  existing
       record  shall  be  replaced  with  the new record. If the database contains a record that matches the <u>key</u>
       argument and <u>store_mode</u> is DBM_INSERT, the existing record shall be left unchanged  and  the  new  record
       ignored. If the database does not contain a record that matches the <u>key</u> argument and <u>store_mode</u> is either
       DBM_INSERT or DBM_REPLACE, the new record shall be inserted in the database.

       If  the  sum  of a key/content pair exceeds the internal block size, the result is unspecified. Moreover,
       the application shall ensure that all key/content pairs that hash together fit on  a  single  block.  The
       <u>dbm_store</u>() function shall return an error in the event that a disk block fills with inseparable data.

       The  <u>dbm_delete</u>()  function  shall  delete  a  record and its key from the database. The argument <u>db</u> is a
       pointer to a database structure that has been returned from a call to <u>dbm_open</u>().  The argument <u>key</u> is  a
       <b>datum</b> that has been initialized by the application to the value of the key that identifies the record the
       program is deleting.

       The <u>dbm_firstkey</u>() function shall return the first key in the database. The argument <u>db</u> is a pointer to a
       database structure that has been returned from a call to <u>dbm_open</u>().

       The  <u>dbm_nextkey</u>()  function shall return the next key in the database. The argument <u>db</u> is a pointer to a
       database structure that has been returned from a call to <u>dbm_open</u>().  The application shall  ensure  that
       the  <u>dbm_firstkey</u>()  function  is called before calling <u>dbm_nextkey</u>().  Subsequent calls to <u>dbm_nextkey</u>()
       return the next key until all of the keys in the database have been returned.

       The <u>dbm_error</u>() function shall return the error condition of the database. The argument <u>db</u> is  a  pointer
       to a database structure that has been returned from a call to <u>dbm_open</u>().

       The <u>dbm_clearerr</u>() function shall clear the error condition of the database. The argument <u>db</u> is a pointer
       to a database structure that has been returned from a call to <u>dbm_open</u>().

       The  <u>dptr</u>  pointers  returned  by  these  functions  may point into static storage that may be changed by
       subsequent calls.

       These functions need not be thread-safe.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>dbm_store</u>() and <u>dbm_delete</u>() functions shall return 0 when they succeed and  a  negative  value  when
       they fail.

       The <u>dbm_store</u>() function shall return 1 if it is called with a <u>flags</u> value of DBM_INSERT and the function
       finds an existing record with the same key.

       The  <u>dbm_error</u>() function shall return 0 if the error condition is not set and return a non-zero value if
       the error condition is set.

       The return value of <u>dbm_clearerr</u>() is unspecified.

       The <u>dbm_firstkey</u>() and <u>dbm_nextkey</u>() functions shall return a key <b>datum</b>.  When the end of the database is
       reached, the <u>dptr</u> member of the key is a null pointer. If an error is detected, the <u>dptr</u>  member  of  the
       key shall be a null pointer and the error condition of the database shall be set.

       The  <u>dbm_fetch</u>()  function shall return a content <b>datum</b>.  If no record in the database matches the key or
       if an error condition has been detected in the database, the <u>dptr</u> member of the content shall be  a  null
       pointer.

       The  <u>dbm_open</u>()  function  shall return a pointer to a database structure. If an error is detected during
       the operation, <u>dbm_open</u>() shall return a (<b>DBM</b> <b>*</b>)0.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The following code can be used to traverse the database:

           for(key = dbm_firstkey(db); key.dptr != NULL; key = dbm_nextkey(db))

       The <u>dbm</u><b>_</b>* functions provided in this library should not be confused in any way with those of  a  general-
       purpose  database  management  system. These functions do not provide for multiple search keys per entry,
       they do not protect against multi-user access (in other words they do not lock  records  or  files),  and
       they  do  not  provide  the  many  other useful database functions that are found in more robust database
       management systems. Creating and updating databases by use of these functions is relatively slow  because
       of  data  copies  that  occur upon hash collisions. These functions are useful for applications requiring
       fast lookup of relatively static information that is to be indexed by a single key.

       Note that a strictly conforming application is extremely limited by these functions: since  there  is  no
       way  to determine that the keys in use do not all hash to the same value (although that would be rare), a
       strictly conforming application cannot be guaranteed that it can store more than  one  block's  worth  of
       data  in  the  database.  As  long  as a key collision does not occur, additional data may be stored, but
       because there is no way to determine whether an error is due to a  key  collision  or  some  other  error
       condition  (<u>dbm_error</u>()  being  effectively  a  Boolean),  once  an error is detected, the application is
       effectively limited to guessing what the error might be if it wishes to continue using these functions.

       The <u>dbm_delete</u>() function need not physically reclaim file space, although it does make it available  for
       reuse by the database.

       After  calling  <u>dbm_store</u>()  or  <u>dbm_delete</u>()  during  a  pass  through  the  keys  by <u>dbm_firstkey</u>() and
       <u>dbm_nextkey</u>(), the application should reset the database by calling <u>dbm_firstkey</u>() before  again  calling
       <u>dbm_nextkey</u>().  The contents of these files are unspecified and may not be portable.

       Applications  should  take care that database pathname arguments specified to <u>dbm_open</u>() are not prefixes
       of unrelated files. This might be done, for example, by placing databases in a separate directory.

       Since some implementations use three characters for a suffix and others use four characters for a suffix,
       applications should ensure that the maximum portable pathname length passed to <u>dbm_open</u>() is  no  greater
       than {PATH_MAX}-4 bytes, with the last component of the pathname no greater than {NAME_MAX}-4 bytes.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Previously  the  standard  required  the  database  to be stored in two files, one file being a directory
       containing a bitmap of keys and having <b>.dir</b> as its suffix. The second file containing all data and having
       <b>.pag</b> as its suffix. This has been changed not to specify  the  use  of  the  files  and  to  allow  newer
       implementations  of  the  Berkeley  DB  interface  using  a single file that have evolved while remaining
       compatible with the application programming interface. The standard developers  considered  removing  the
       specific  suffixes  altogether  but decided to retain them so as not to pollute the application file name
       space more than necessary and to allow for portable backups of the database.
