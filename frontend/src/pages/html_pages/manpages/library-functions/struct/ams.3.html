</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The ams library provides functions enabling application software to use AMS to send and receive brief
       messages, up to 65000 bytes in length.  It conforms to AMS Blue Book, including support for Remote AMS
       (RAMS).

       In the ION implementation of RAMS, the "RAMS network protocol" may be either the DTN Bundle Protocol (RFC
       5050) or -- mainly for testing purposes -- the User Datagram Protocol (RFC 768).  BP is the default.
       When BP is used as the RAMS network protocol, endpoints are by default assumed to conform to the "ipn"
       endpoint identifier scheme with <b>node</b> <b>number</b> set to the AMS <b>continuum</b> <b>number</b> and <b>service</b> <b>number</b> set to the
       AMS <b>venture</b> <b>number</b>.

       Note that RAMS functionality is enabled by instantiating a <b>ramsgate</b> daemon, which is simply an AMS
       application program that acts as a gateway between the local AMS message space and the RAMS network.

       AMS differs from other ION packages in that there is no utilization of non-volatile storage (aside from
       the BP functionality in RAMS, if applicable).  Since there is no non-volatile AMS database, there is no
       AMS administration program and there are no library functions for attaching to or detaching from such a
       database.  AMS is instantiated by commencing operation of the AMS real-time daemon <b>amsd</b>; once <b>amsd</b> is
       running, AMS application programs ("modules") can be started.  All management of AMS operational state is
       performed automatically in real time.

       However, <b>amsd</b> and the AMS application programs all require access to a common store of configuration data
       at startup in order to load their Management Information Bases.  This configuration data must reside in a
       readable file, which may take either of two forms: a file of XML statements conforming to the scheme
       described in the <u><a href="../man5/amsxml.5.html">amsxml</a></u>(5) man page, or a file of simple but less powerful configuration statements as
       described in the <u><a href="../man5/amsrc.5.html">amsrc</a></u>(5) man page.  The <b>amsxml</b> alternative requires that the <b>expat</b> XML parsing system be
       installed; the <b>amsrc</b> alternative was developed to simplify deployment of AMS in environments in which
       <b>expat</b> is not readily supported.  Selection of the configuration file format is a compile-time decision,
       implemented by setting (or not setting) the -DNOEXPAT compiler option.

       The path name of the applicable configuration file may be passed as a command-line parameter to <b>amsd</b> and
       as a registration function parameter by any AMS application program.  Note, though, that <b>ramsgate</b> and the
       AMS test and utility programs included in ION always assume that the configuration file resides in the
       current working directory and that it is named "mib.amsrc" if AMS was built with -DNOEXPAT, "amsmib.xml"
       otherwise.

       The transport services that are made available to AMS communicating entities are declared by the
       transportServiceLoaders array in the libams.c source file.  This array is fixed at compile time.  The
       order of preference of the transport services in the array is hard-coded, but the inclusion or omission
       of individual transport services is controlled by setting compiler options.  The "udp" transport service
       -- nominally the most preferred because it imposes the least processing and transmission overhead -- is
       included by setting the -DUDPTS option.  The "dgr" service is included by setting the -DDGRTS option.
       The "vmq" (VxWorks message queue) service, supported only on VxWorks, is included by setting the -DVMQTS
       option.  The "tcp" transport service -- selected only when its quality of service is required -- is
       included by setting the -DTCPTS option.

       The operating state of any single AMS application program is managed in an opaque AmsModule object.  This
       object is returned when the application begins AMS operations (that is, registers) and must be provided
       as an argument to most AMS functions.

       int ams_register(char *mibSource, char *tsorder, char *applicationName, char *authorityName, char
       *unitName, char *roleName, AmsModule *module)
           Registers  the  application  within  a  cell (identified by <u>unitName</u>) of a message space that is that
           portion of the venture identified by <u>applicationName</u> and <u>authorityName</u> that runs within the local AMS
           continuum.  <u>roleName</u> identifies the role that this application will perform  in  this  venture.   The
           operating state of the registered application is returned in <u>module</u>.

           The  application  module's identifying parameters are validated against the configuration information
           in the applicable Management Information Base, which is automatically  loaded  from  the  file  whose
           pathname  is  provided  in  <u>mibSource</u>.   If <u>mibSource</u> is the zero-length string ("") then the default
           configuration file name is used as noted above.  If <u>mibSource</u> is NULL then a  rudimentary  hard-coded
           default MIB, useful for basic testing purposes, is loaded.  This default MIB defines a single venture
           for  application  "amsdemo"  and  authority  "test", using only the "dgr" transport service, with the
           configuration server residing on the local host machine; subject "text"  and  roles  "shell",  "log",
           "pitch", and "catch" are defined.

           The  <u>tsorder</u>  argument  is  normally  NULL.  If non-NULL it must be a NULL-terminated string of ASCII
           numeric digits '0' through '9' identifying an alternative transport  service  preference  order  that
           overrides  the  standard  transport  service  preference  order  defined  by  the hard-coded array of
           transportServiceLoaders in the libams.c source file.  Each  character  of  the  <u>tsorder</u>  string  must
           represent  the  index  position  of  one of the transport services within the array.  For example, if
           services "udp", "dgr", "vmq", and "tcp" are all available in the array,  a  <u>tsorder</u>  string  of  "32"
           would indicate that this application will only communicate using the tcp and vmq services; services 0
           (udp)  and 1 (dgr) will not be used, and tcp is preferred to vmq when both are candidate services for
           transmission of a given message.

           Returns 0 on success.  On any error, sets <u>module</u> to NULL and returns -1.

       int ams_unregister(AmsModule module)
           Reverses the operation of <u>ams_unregister()</u>, destroying <u>module</u>.  Returns  0  on  success,  -1  on  any
           error.

       int ams_invite(AmsModule module, int roleNbr, int continuumNbr, int unitNbr, int subjectNbr, int
       priority, unsigned char flowLabel, AmsSequence sequence, AmsDiligence diligence)
           Announces this module's agreement to receive messages on the subject identified by <u>subjectNbr</u>.

           The  invitation  is  extended  only  to modules registered in the role identified by <u>roleNbr</u> (where 0
           indicates "all roles"), operating in the continuum identifed by <u>continuumNbr</u> (where 0 indicates  "all
           continua"),  and  registered  within  the unit identified by <u>unitNbr</u> (where 0 indicates the venture's
           root unit) or any of that unit's subunits.  These parameters define the "domain" of the invitation.

           Such messages should be sent at the priority indicated by <u>priority</u> with flow label  as  indicated  by
           <u>flowLabel</u>  and  with  quality of service as indicated by <u>sequence</u> and <u>diligence</u>.  <u>priority</u> must be an
           integer in the range 1-15, where priority 1 indicates the greatest urgency.  Flow labels  are  passed
           through  to transport services and are opaque to AMS itself; in the absence of defined flow labels, a
           value of 0 is typically used.  These parameters define the "class of service" of the invitation.

           Returns 0 on success, -1 on any error.

       int ams_disinvite(AmsModule module, int roleNbr, int continuumNbr, int unitNbr, int subjectNbr)

       int ams_subscribe(AmsModule module, int roleNbr, int continuumNbr, int unitNbr, int subjectNbr, int
       priority, unsigned char flowLabel, AmsSequence sequence, AmsDiligence diligence)
           Announces  this  module's  subscription  to  messages  on  the  indicated subject, constrained by the
           indicated domain, and transmitted subject to the indicated class of service.  Note that subscriptions
           differ from invitations in  that  reception  of  these  messages  is  actively  solicited,  not  just
           permitted.

           Returns 0 on success, -1 on any error.

       int ams_unsubscribe(AmsModule module, int roleNbr, int continuumNbr, int unitNbr, int subjectNbr)

           all  modules  whose  subscriptions  to  <u>subjectNbr</u>  are  characterized by a domain that includes this
           module.  <u>priority</u> and <u>flowLabel</u>,  if  non-zero,  override  class  of  service  as  requested  in  the
           subscriptions.   <u>context</u>  is  an  opaque  "hint"  to  the  receiving modules; its use is application-
           specific.

           Returns 0 on success, -1 on any error.

       priority, unsigned char flowLabel, int contentLength, char *content, int context)
           Sends <u>contentLength</u> bytes of data starting at <u>content</u> as the content of a message that is transmitted
           privately to the module in the continuum identified by <u>continuumNbr</u> (where  0  indicates  "the  local
           continuum")  that  is identified by <u>unitNbr</u> and <u>moduleNbr</u> -- provided that <u>module</u> is in the domain of
           one of that module's invitations on <u>subjectNbr</u>.  <u>priority</u> and <u>flowLabel</u>, if non-zero, override  class
           of  service as requested in the invitation.  <u>context</u> is an opaque "hint" to the receiving module; its
           use is application-specific.

           Returns 0 on success, -1 on any error.

       int ams_query(AmsModule module, int continuumNbr, int unitNbr, int moduleNbr, int subjectNbr, int
       priority, unsigned char flowLabel, int contentLength, char *content, int context, int term, AmsEvent
       *event)
           Sends a message exactly is described above for <u>ams_send()</u>, but additionally suspends the delivery and
           processing of newly received messages until either (a) a "reply" message sent  in  response  to  this
           message  is  received  or  (b)  the  time interval indicated by <u>term</u>, in seconds, expires.  The event
           (reply or timeout) that ends  the  suspension  of  processing  is  provided  in  <u>event</u>  (as  if  from
           <u>ams_get_event()</u> when the function returns.

           If  <u>term</u>  is  AMS_BLOCKING then the timeout interval is indefinite; only reception of a reply message
           enables the function to return.  If <u>term</u> is AMS_POLL then the function returns  immediately,  without
           waiting for a reply message.

           Returns 0 on success, -1 on any error.

       int ams_reply(AmsModule module, AmsEvent msg, int subjectNbr, int priority, unsigned char flowLabel, int
       contentLength, char *content)
           Sends a message exactly is described above for <u>ams_send()</u>, except that the destination of the message
           is the sender of the message identified by <u>msg</u> and the "context" value included in the message is the
           context  that was provided in <u>msg</u>.  This message is identified as a "reply" message that will end the
           processing suspension resulting from transmission of <u>msg</u> if that  message  was  issued  by  means  of
           <u>ams_query()</u> rather than <u>ams_send()</u>.

           Returns 0 on success, -1 on any error.

       int ams_announce(AmsModule module, int roleNbr, int continuumNbr, int unitNbr, int subjectNbr, int
       priority, unsigned char flowLabel, int contentLength, char *content, int context)
           Sends  a  message  exactly  is described above for <u>ams_send()</u>, except that one copy of the message is
           sent to every module in the domain of this function (role,  continuum,  unit)  whose  invitation  for
           messages  on  this  subject is itself characterized by a domain that includes the the sending module,
           rather than to any specific module.

           Returns 0 on success, -1 on any error.

       int ams_get_event(AmsModule module, int term, AmsEvent *event)
           Returns in <u>event</u> the next event in the queue of AMS events pending delivery to this module.   If  the
           event  queue  is  empty  at the time this function is called, processing is suspended until either an
           event is queued or the time interval indicated by <u>term</u>, in seconds, expires.  See  <u>ams_query()</u>  above
           for  the  semantics  of  <u>term</u>.   When  the  function  returns on expiration of <u>term</u>, an event of type
           TIMEOUT_EVT is returned in <u>event</u>.  Otherwise the  event  will  be  of  type  AMS_MSG_EVT  (indicating
           arrival of a message), NOTICE_EVT (indicating a change in the configuration of the message space), or
           USER_DEFINED_EVT (indicating that application code posted an event).

           The  nature  of  the  event  returned  by  <u>ams_get_event()</u>  can  be  determined  by  passing <u>event</u> to
           <u>ams_get_event_type()</u> as described below.  Event type can  then  be  used  to  determine  whether  the
           information  content of the event must be obtained by calling <u>ams_parse_msg()</u>, <u>ams_parse_notice()</u>, or
           <u>ams_parse_user_event()</u>.

           In any case, the memory occupied by <u>event</u> must be released  after  the  event  object  is  no  longer
           needed.  The <u>ams_recycle_event()</u> function is invoked for this purpose.

           be NOTICE_EVT.

           Note  that  different fields will be populated depending on the nature of the notice in <u>event</u>.  <u>state</u>
           will be set to  AmsRegistrationState,  AmsInvitationState,  or  AmsSubscription  state  depending  on
           whether  the notice pertains to a change in module registration, a change in invitations, or a change
           in subscriptions.  <u>change</u> will be set to AmsStateBegins or  AmsStateEnds  depending  on  whether  the
           notice pertains to the initiation or termination of a registration, invitation, or subscription.

           Returns 0 on success, -1 on any error.

           <u>userEventData</u>.  <u>userEventCode</u> is an application-specific value  that  is  opaque  to  AMS.   <u>priority</u>
           determines the event's position in the queue of events pending delivery to this module; it may be any
           integer  in  the  range  0-15, where 0 indicates the greatest urgency.  (Note that user events can be
           delivered ahead of all message reception events if necessary.)
