   <b>mlx5_qp_attr</b>
              struct mlx5dv_qp_init_attr {
                  uint64_t comp_mask;
                  uint32_t create_flags;
                  struct mlx5dv_dc_init_attr  dc_init_attr;
                  uint64_t send_ops_flags;
              };

       <u>comp_mask</u>
              Bitmask      specifying      what      fields      in      the      structure      are      valid:
              MLX5DV_QP_INIT_ATTR_MASK_QP_CREATE_FLAGS:        valid        values        in        <u>create_flags</u>
              MLX5DV_QP_INIT_ATTR_MASK_DC: valid values in <u>dc_init_attr</u> MLX5DV_QP_INIT_ATTR_MASK_SEND_OPS_FLAGS:
              valid values in <u>send_ops_flags</u>

       <u>create_flags</u>
              A bitwise OR of the various values described below.

              MLX5DV_QP_CREATE_TUNNEL_OFFLOADS:  Enable  offloading  such  as  checksum  and  LRO  for  incoming
              tunneling traffic.

              MLX5DV_QP_CREATE_TIR_ALLOW_SELF_LOOPBACK_UC: Allow receiving loopback unicast traffic.

              MLX5DV_QP_CREATE_TIR_ALLOW_SELF_LOOPBACK_MC: Allow receiving loopback multicast traffic.

              MLX5DV_QP_CREATE_DISABLE_SCATTER_TO_CQE: Disable scatter  to  CQE  feature  which  is  enabled  by
              default.

              MLX5DV_QP_CREATE_ALLOW_SCATTER_TO_CQE:  Allow  scatter to CQE for requester even if the qp was not
              configured to signal all WRs.

              MLX5DV_QP_CREATE_PACKET_BASED_CREDIT_MODE: Set QP  to  work  in  end-to-end  packet-based  credit,
              instead of the default message-based credits (IB spec.  section 9.7.7.2).
              It is the applications responsibility to make sure that the peer QP is configured with same mode.

              MLX5DV_QP_CREATE_SIG_PIPELINING:  If  the  flag  is  set,  the  QP  is  moved  to  SQD  state upon
              encountering a signature error, and IBV_EVENT_SQ_DRAINED is generated  to  inform  about  the  new
              state.   The signature pipelining feature is a performance optimization, which reduces latency for
              read operations in the storage protocols.  The feature is optional.  Creating the QP fails if  the
              kernel  or  device  does not support the feature.  In this case, an application should fallback to
              backward compatibility mode and handle read operations without the pipelining.  See details  about
              the signature pipelining in <b><a href="../man3/mlx5dv_qp_cancel_posted_send_wrs.3.html">mlx5dv_qp_cancel_posted_send_wrs</a></b>(3).

              MLX5DV_QP_CREATE_OOO_DP:  If  the  flag  is  set,  Receive  WRs on the receiver side of the QP are
              allowed to be consumed out-of-order and sender side of the QP  is  allowed  to  transmit  messages
              without guaranteeing any arrival ordering on the receiver side.

                     The flag, when set, must be set both on the sender and receiver side of
                     a QP (e.g., DCT and DCI).

                     Setting the flag is optional and the availability of this feature should
                     be queried by the application (See details in
                     **mlx5dv_query_device**(3)) and there is no automatic fallback: If the
                     flag is set while kernel or device does not support the feature, then
                     creating the QP fails. Thus, before creating a QP with this flag set,
                     application must query the maximal outstanding Receive WRs possible on a
                     QP with this flag set, according to the QP type (see details in
                     **mlx5dv_query_device**(3)) and make sure the capability is supported.

                     &gt; **Note**
                     &gt;
                     &gt; All the following describe the behavior and semantics of a QP
                     &gt; with this flag set.

                     Completions' delivery ordering:

                     A Receive WR posted on this QP may be consumed by any arriving message
                     to this QP that requires Receive WR consumption. Nonetheless, the
                     ordering in which work completions are delivered for the posted WRs,
                     both on sender side and receiver side, remains unchanged when this flag
                     is set (and is independent of the ordering in which the Receive WRs are
                     consumed). The ID delivered in every work completion (wr_id) will
                     specify which WR was completed by the delivered work completion.

                     Data placing and operations' execution ordering:

                     RDMA Read and RDMA Atomic operations are executed on the responder side
                     in order, i.e., these operations are executed after all previous
                     messages are done executing.
                     However, the ordering of RDMA Read response packets being scattered
                     to memory on the requestor side is not guaranteed. This means that,
                     although the data is read after executing all previous messages,
                     it may be scattered out-of-order on the requestor side.

                     Ordering of write requests towards the memory on the responder side,
                     initiated by RDMA Send, RDMA Send with Immediate, RDMA Write or RDMA
                     Write with Immediate is not guaranteed.

                     Good and bad practice:

                     Since it cannot be guaranteed which RDMA Send (and/or RDMA Send with
                     Immediate) will consume a Receive WR (and will scatter its data to the
                     memory buffers specified in the WR) it's not recommended to post
                     different sizes of Receive WRs.

                     Polling on any memory that is used by the device to scatter data, is not
                     recommended since ordering of data placement of RDMA Send, RDMA Write
                     and RDMA Write with Immediate is not guaranteed.

                     Receiver, upon getting a completion for an RDMA Write with Immediate,
                     should not rely on wr_id alone to determine to which memory data was
                     scattered by the operation.

       <u>dc_init_attr</u>
              DC init attributes.

   <u><b>dc_init_attr</b></u>
              struct mlx5dv_dci_streams {
                  uint8_t log_num_concurent;
                  uint8_t log_num_errored;
              };

              struct mlx5dv_dc_init_attr {

                  };
              };

       <u>dc_type</u>
              MLX5DV_DCTYPE_DCT QP type: Target DC.  MLX5DV_DCTYPE_DCI QP type: Initiator DC.

       <u>dct_access_key</u>
              used to create a DCT QP.

       <u>dci_streams</u>
              dci_streams used to define DCI QP with multiple concurrent streams.  Valid when comp_mask includes
              MLX5DV_QP_INIT_ATTR_MASK_DCI_STREAMS.

              log_num_concurent  Defines  the  number of parallel different streams that could be handled by HW.
              All work request of a specific stream_id are handled in order.

              log_num_errored Defines the number of dci error stream channels before  moving  DCI  to  an  error
              state.

       <u>send_ops_flags</u>
              A bitwise OR of the various values described below.

              MLX5DV_QP_EX_WITH_MR_INTERLEAVED: Enables the mlx5dv_wr_mr_interleaved() work requset on this QP.

              MLX5DV_QP_EX_WITH_MR_LIST: Enables the mlx5dv_wr_mr_list() work requset on this QP.

              MLX5DV_QP_EX_WITH_MKEY_CONFIGURE:  Enables  the  mlx5dv_wr_mkey_configure()  work  request and the
              related setters on this QP.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mlx5dv_qp_ex_from_ibv_qp_ex()</b> is used to get <u>struct</u> <u>mlx5dv_qp_ex</u> for accessing the  send  ops  interfaces
       when IBV_QP_INIT_ATTR_SEND_OPS_FLAGS is used.

       The  MLX5DV_QP_CREATE_DISABLE_SCATTER_TO_CQE  flag  should  be  set  in cases that IOVA doesn’t match the
       process’ VA and the message payload size is small enough to trigger the scatter to CQE feature.

       When device memory is used IBV_SEND_INLINE and scatter to CQE should not be used, as the  memcpy  is  not
       possible.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mlx5dv_create_qp()</b>  returns a pointer to the created QP, on error NULL will be returned and errno will be
       set.
