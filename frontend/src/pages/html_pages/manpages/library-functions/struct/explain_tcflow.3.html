       explain_tcflow - explain <a href="../man3/tcflow.3.html">tcflow</a>(3) errors

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;libexplain/tcflow.h&gt;
       const char *explain_tcflow(int fildes, int action);
       const char *explain_errno_tcflow(int errnum, int fildes, int action);
       void explain_message_tcflow(char *message, int message_size, int fildes, int action);
       void explain_message_errno_tcflow(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, int fildes, int action);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These functions may be used to obtain explanations for errors returned by the <u><a href="../man3/tcflow.3.html">tcflow</a></u>(3) system call.

   <b>explain_tcflow</b>
       const char *explain_tcflow(int fildes, int action);

       The <b>explain_tcflow</b> function is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the <u><a href="../man3/tcflow.3.html">tcflow</a></u>(3) system
       call.  The  least  the  message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it will do much
       better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       <u>fildes</u>  The original fildes, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/tcflow.3.html">tcflow</a></u>(3) system call.

       <u>action</u>  The original action, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/tcflow.3.html">tcflow</a></u>(3) system call.

       Returns:
               The message explaining the error. This message buffer is shared by all libexplain functions which
               do not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to  any
               libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b>  This  function  is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all threads, and many
       other functions in this library.

       <b>Example:</b> This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (tcflow(fildes, action) &lt; 0)
              {
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_tcflow(fildes, action));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_tcflow_or_die.3.html">explain_tcflow_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

   <b>explain_errno_tcflow</b>
       const char *explain_errno_tcflow(int errnum, int fildes, int action);

       The <b>explain_errno_tcflow</b> function is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the  <u><a href="../man3/tcflow.3.html">tcflow</a></u>(3)
       system  call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it will do
       much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       <u>errnum</u>  The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just  before  this
               function  is called. This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>fildes</u>  The original fildes, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/tcflow.3.html">tcflow</a></u>(3) system call.

       <u>action</u>  The original action, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/tcflow.3.html">tcflow</a></u>(3) system call.

       Returns:
               The message explaining the error. This message buffer is shared by all libexplain functions which
               do not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to  any
               libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b>  This  function  is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all threads, and many
       other functions in this library.

       <b>Example:</b> This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (tcflow(fildes, action) &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_errno_tcflow(err, fildes, action));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_tcflow_or_die.3.html">explain_tcflow_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

   <b>explain_message_tcflow</b>
       void explain_message_tcflow(char *message, int message_size, int fildes, int action);

       The <b>explain_message_tcflow</b> function is used to  obtain  an  explanation  of  an  error  returned  by  the
       <u><a href="../man3/tcflow.3.html">tcflow</a></u>(3) system call. The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it
       will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       <u>message</u> The  location  in  which  to  store  the returned message. If a suitable message return buffer is
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>fildes</u>  The original fildes, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/tcflow.3.html">tcflow</a></u>(3) system call.

       <u>action</u>  The original action, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/tcflow.3.html">tcflow</a></u>(3) system call.

       <b>Example:</b> This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (tcflow(fildes, action) &lt; 0)
              {
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_tcflow(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), fildes, action);
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_tcflow_or_die.3.html">explain_tcflow_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

   <b>explain_message_errno_tcflow</b>
       void explain_message_errno_tcflow(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, int fildes, int action);

       The <b>explain_message_errno_tcflow</b> function is used to obtain an explanation of an error  returned  by  the
       <u><a href="../man3/tcflow.3.html">tcflow</a></u>(3) system call. The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it
       will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>errnum</u>  The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just  before  this
               function  is called. This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to be

       <u>action</u>  The original action, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/tcflow.3.html">tcflow</a></u>(3) system call.

       <b>Example:</b> This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
