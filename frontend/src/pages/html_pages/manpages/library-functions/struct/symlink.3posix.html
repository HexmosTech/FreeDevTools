</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       symlink, symlinkat — make a symbolic link

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;

       int symlink(const char *<u>path1</u>, const char *<u>path2</u>);

       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/fcntl.h">fcntl.h</a>&gt;

       int symlinkat(const char *<u>path1</u>, int <u>fd</u>, const char *<u>path2</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>symlink</u>()  function shall create a symbolic link called <u>path2</u> that contains the string pointed to by
       <u>path1</u> (<u>path2</u> is the name of the symbolic link created, <u>path1</u> is the  string  contained  in  the  symbolic
       link).

       The  string  pointed  to  by  <u>path1</u>  shall  be  treated  only as a string and shall not be validated as a
       pathname.

       If the <u>symlink</u>() function fails for any reason other than  <b>[EIO]</b>,  any  file  named  by  <u>path2</u>  shall  be
       unaffected.

       If <u>path2</u> names a symbolic link, <u>symlink</u>() shall fail and set <u>errno</u> to <b>[EEXIST]</b>.

       The  symbolic link's user ID shall be set to the process' effective user ID. The symbolic link's group ID
       shall be set to the group ID of the parent directory or  to  the  effective  group  ID  of  the  process.
       Implementations  shall  provide  a  way to initialize the symbolic link's group ID to the group ID of the
       parent directory. Implementations may, but need not, provide an implementation-defined way to  initialize
       the symbolic link's group ID to the effective group ID of the calling process.

       The  values of the file mode bits for the created symbolic link are unspecified. All interfaces specified
       by POSIX.1‐2008 shall behave as if the contents of symbolic links can always be  read,  except  that  the
       value of the file mode bits returned in the <u>st_mode</u> field of the <b>stat</b> structure is unspecified.

       Upon successful completion, <u>symlink</u>() shall mark for update the last data access, last data modification,
       and  last  file  status change timestamps of the symbolic link. Also, the last data modification and last
       file status change timestamps of the directory that contains the new entry shall be marked for update.

       The <u>symlinkat</u>() function shall be equivalent to the <u>symlink</u>() function except in  the  case  where  <u>path2</u>
       specifies a relative path. In this case the symbolic link is created relative to the directory associated
       with the file descriptor <u>fd</u> instead of the current working directory. If the access mode of the open file
       description  associated  with  the  file  descriptor  is  not  O_SEARCH, the function shall check whether
       directory searches are permitted using the current permissions  of  the  directory  underlying  the  file
       descriptor. If the access mode is O_SEARCH, the function shall not perform the check.

       If  <u>symlinkat</u>()  is  passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <u>fd</u> parameter, the current working directory
       shall be used and the behavior shall be identical to a call to <u>symlink</u>().

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return 0.  Otherwise, these functions shall  return  -1
       and set <u>errno</u> to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> Write  permission  is  denied in the directory where the symbolic link is being created, or search
              permission is denied for a component of the path prefix of <u>path2</u>.

       <b>EEXIST</b> The <u>path2</u> argument names an existing file.

       <b>EIO</b>    An I/O error occurs while reading from or writing to the file system.

       <b>ELOOP</b>  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the <u>path2</u> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of  the  pathname  specified  by  the  <u>path2</u>  argument  is  longer  than
              {NAME_MAX} or the length of the <u>path1</u> argument is longer than {SYMLINK_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT</b> A  component  of  the  path  prefix  of  <u>path2</u> does not name an existing file or <u>path2</u> is an empty
              string.

       <b>ENOENT</b> or <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <u>path2</u> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt; character and ends with one or more  trailing
              &lt;slash&gt;  characters. If <u>path2</u> without the trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters would name an existing file,
              an <b>[ENOENT]</b> error shall not occur.

       <b>ENOSPC</b> The directory in which the entry for the new symbolic link is  being  placed  cannot  be  extended
              because  no  space  is  left on the file system containing the directory, or the new symbolic link
              cannot be created because no space is left on the file system which shall contain the link, or the
              file system is out of file-allocation resources.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix of <u>path2</u> names an existing file that is neither a directory  nor  a
              symbolic link to a directory.

       <b>EROFS</b>  The new symbolic link would reside on a read-only file system.

       The <u>symlinkat</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> The  access  mode  of  the  open  file  description  associated  with  <u>fd</u>  is not O_SEARCH and the
              permissions of the directory underlying <u>fd</u> do not permit directory searches.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>path2</u> argument does not specify an absolute path and the <u>fd</u> argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a
              valid file descriptor open for reading or searching.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <u>path2</u> argument is not an absolute path and <u>fd</u> is a file  descriptor  associated  with  a  non-
              directory file.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP</b>  More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the <u>path2</u> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The  length  of the <u>path2</u> argument exceeds {PATH_MAX} or pathname resolution of a symbolic link in
              the <u>path2</u> argument produced an intermediate result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Like a hard link, a symbolic link allows a file to have multiple logical names. The presence  of  a  hard
       link  guarantees  the existence of a file, even after the original name has been removed. A symbolic link
       provides no such assurance; in fact, the file named by the <u>path1</u> argument need not exist when the link is
       created. A symbolic link can cross file system boundaries.

       Normal permission checks are made on each component of the symbolic link pathname during its resolution.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The purpose of the <u>symlinkat</u>() function is to create symbolic links in directories other than the current
       working directory without exposure to race conditions. Any part of the path of a file could be changed in
       parallel to a call to <u>symlink</u>(), resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a file descriptor for  the
       target  directory  and using the <u>symlinkat</u>() function it can be guaranteed that the created symbolic link
       is located relative to the desired directory.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
