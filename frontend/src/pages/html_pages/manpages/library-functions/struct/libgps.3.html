</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>C</b>
       <b>libgps</b> is a service library which supports communicating with an instance of the <b><a href="../man8/gpsd.8.html">gpsd</a></b>(8), link it with
       the linker option <b>-lgps</b>. Some systems may also require <b>-lm</b>.

           <b>Warning</b>

           Take care to conditionalize your code on the major and minor API version symbols in <b>gps.h</b>; ideally,
           force a compilation failure if GPSD_API_MAJOR_VERSION is not a version you recognize. See the GPSD
           project website for more information on the protocol and API changes.

       All the functions described here use the <b>gps_data_t</b> structure. Consult <b>gps.h</b> to learn more about
       <b>gps_data_t</b>, its data members, associated structures. associated timestamps. Note that information will
       accumulate in the session structure over time, and the 'valid' field is not automatically zeroed by each
       <b>gps_read()</b>. It is up to the client to zero that field when appropriate and to keep an eye on the fix and
       sentence timestamps.

           <b>Warning</b>

           <b>gps_data_t</b> sets floating point variables to NaN when the actual variable value is unknown. Check all
           floats and doubles with <b>isfinite()</b> before using them. <b>isnan()</b> is not sufficient!

       <b>gps_open()</b>
           Calling <b>gps_open()</b> initializes a <b>gps_data_t</b> structure to hold the data collected by the GPS, and sets
           up access to <b><a href="../man8/gpsd.8.html">gpsd</a></b>(8) via either the socket or shared-memory export. The shared-memory export is
           faster, but does not carry information about device activation and deactivation events and will not
           allow you to monitor device packet traffic.

           <b>gps_open()</b> returns 0 on success, -1 on errors and is re-entrant. errno is set depending on the error
           returned from the socket or shared-memory interface; see <b>gps.h</b> for values and explanations; also see
           <b>gps_errstr()</b>. The host address may be a DNS name, an IPv4 dotted quad, an IPV6 address, or the
           special value <b>GPSD_SHARED_MEMORY</b> referring to the shared-memory export; the library will do the right
           thing for any of these.

       <b>gps_close()</b>
           <b>gps_close()</b> ends the session and should only be called after a successful <b>gps_open()</b>. It returns 0 on
           success, -1 on errors. The shared-memory interface close always returns 0, whereas a socket close can
           result in an error. For a socket close error it will have set an errno from the call to the systemâ€™s
           <b>close()</b>.

       <b>gps_send()</b>
           <b>gps_send()</b> writes a command to the <b>gpsd</b> daemon. It does nothing when using the shared-memory export.
           The second argument must be a format string containing elements from the command set documented at
           <b><a href="../man8/gpsd.8.html">gpsd</a></b>(8). It may have % elements as for <a href="../man3/sprintf.3.html">sprintf</a>(3), which will be filled in from any following
           arguments. This function returns a -1 if there was a Unix-level write error, otherwise 0. Please read
           the LIMITATIONS section for additional information and cautions. See <b>gps_stream()</b> as a possible
           alternative.

       <b>gps_read()</b>
           <b>gps_read()</b> accepts a response, or sequence of responses, from the <b>gpsd</b> daemon and decodes the
           response into a <b>gps_data_t</b>. By default, this function does either a blocking read for data from the
           <b>gpsd</b> daemon or a fetch from shared memory; it returns a count of bytes read for success, -1 with
           errno set on a Unix-level read error, -1 with errno not set if the socket to the <b>gpsd</b> daemon has
           closed or if the shared-memory segment was unavailable, and 0 if no data is available.

           The second argument to <b>gps_read()</b> is usually NULL, and the third argument is zero. If your
           application wants to see the raw data from the <b>gpsd</b> daemon then set the second argument to the
           address of your message buffer, and the third argument is the size of your buffer. Use with care;
           this may not to be a NUL-terminated string if WATCH_RAW is enabled.

       <b>gps_waiting()</b>
           <b>gps_waiting()</b> can be used to check whether there is new data from the <b>gpsd</b> daemon. The second
           argument is the maximum amount of time to block (in microseconds) waiting on input before returning.
           It returns true if there is input waiting, false on timeout (no data waiting) or error condition.
           When using the socket export, this function is a convenience wrapper around a <b><a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a></b>(2) call, and
           zeros <b>errno</b> on entry; you can test <b>errno</b> after exit to get more information about error conditions.

           Warning: under the shared-memory interface there is a tiny race window between <b>gps_waiting()</b> and a
           following <b>gps_read()</b>; in that context, because the latter does not block, it is probably better to
           write a simple read loop.

       <b>gps_mainloop()</b>
           <b>gps_mainloop()</b> enables the provided hook function to be continually called whenever there is <b>gpsd</b>
           data. The second argument is the maximum amount of time to wait (in microseconds) on input before
           exiting the loop (and return a value of -1). It will also return a negative value on various errors.

       <b>gps_unpack()</b>
           <b>gps_unpack()</b> parses JSON from the argument buffer into the target of the session structure pointer
           argument. Included in case your application wishes to manage socket I/O itself.

       <b>gps_data()</b>
           <b>gps_data()</b> returns the contents of the client data buffer (it returns NULL when using the
           shared-memory export). Use with care; this may not to be a NUL-terminated string if WATCH_RAW is
           enabled.

       <b>gps_stream()</b>
           <b>gps_stream()</b> asks <b>gpsd</b> to stream the reports it has at you, to be made available when you poll (not
           available when using the shared-memory export). The second argument is a flag mask that sets various
           policy bits; see the list below. Calling <b>gps_stream()</b> more than once with different flag masks is
           allowed.

           <b>WATCH_DEVICE</b>
               Restrict watching to a specified device. The device path string is given as the third argument
               (data).

           <b>WATCH_DISABLE</b>
               Disable the reporting modes specified by the other WATCH_ flags.

           <b>WATCH_ENABLE</b>
               Enable the reporting modes specified by the other WATCH_ flags. This is the default.

           <b>WATCH_JSON</b>
               Enable JSON reporting of data. If WATCH_ENABLE is set, and no other WATCH flags are set, this is
               the default.

           <b>WATCH_NEWSTYLE</b>
               Force issuing a JSON initialization and getting new-style responses. This is the default.

           <b>WATCH_NMEA</b>
               Enable generated pseudo-NMEA reporting on binary devices.

           <b>WATCH_OLDSTYLE</b>
               Force issuing a W or R command and getting old-style responses. Warning: this flag (and the
               capability) will be removed in a future release.

           <b>WATCH_RARE</b>
               Enable reporting of binary packets in encoded hex.

           <b>WATCH_RAW</b>
               Enable literal passthrough of binary packets.

           <b>WATCH_SCALED</b>
               When reporting AIS or Subframe data, scale integer quantities to floats if they have a divisor or
               rendering formula associated with them.

       <b>gps_errstr()</b>
           <b>gps_errstr()</b> returns an ASCII string (in English) describing the error indicated by a nonzero return
           value from <b>gps_open()</b>.

   <b>Python</b>
       The Python implementation supports the same facilities as the the C library. <b>gps_open()</b> is replaced by
       the initialization of a gps session object: <b>session</b> <b>=</b> <b>gps.gps(...)</b>. The other calls are methods of that
       object, and have the same names as the corresponding C functions.

       In addtion to using <b>gps.read()</b> to read messages from <b>gpsd</b>, you can use the session object as an iterator,
       as in the code fragment given below. Python iterators implicitly call the function <b>gps.\_\_next()</b> which
       is just a shim over <b>gps.read()</b>. There is other advantage to using the implicit iterator and it does not
       allow the options that <b>gps.read()</b> does.

           import gps
           session = gps.gps(host="localhost", port="2947")
           session.stream(flags=gps.WATCH_JSON)
           for report in session:
               process(report)
           del session

       Resources within the session object will be properly released when it is garbage-collected.

       For further information on the Python gps module, read the comments in the modules files. There is a
       complete Python example in the file <u>www/gpsd-client-example-code.adoc</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       By setting the environment variable <b>GPSD_SHM_KEY</b>, you can control the key value used to create
       shared-memory segment used for communication with <b>gpsd</b>. This will be useful mainly when isolating test
       instances of <b>gpsd</b> from production ones.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following is a fully functional minimal C client. Check the C source for the other <b>gpsd</b> clients for
       more ideas.

           // example  gpsd client
           // compile this way:
           //    gcc example1.c -o example1 -lgps -lm
           #include &lt;gps.h&gt;         .. for gps_*()
           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/math.h">math.h</a>&gt;        // for isfinite()

           #define MODE_STR_NUM 4
           static char *mode_str[MODE_STR_NUM] = {
               "n/a",
               "None",
               "2D",
               "3D"
           };

           int main(int argc, char *argv[])
           {
               struct gps_data_t gps_data;

               if (0 != gps_open("localhost", "2947", &amp;gps_data)) {
                   printf("Open error.  Bye, bye\n");
                   return 1;
               }

               (void)gps_stream(&amp;gps_data, WATCH_ENABLE | WATCH_JSON, NULL);

               while (gps_waiting(&amp;gps_data, 5000000)) {
                   if (-1 == gps_read(&amp;gps_data, NULL, 0)) {
                       printf("Read error.  Bye, bye\n");
                       break;
                   }
                   if (MODE_SET != (MODE_SET &amp; gps_data.set)) {
                       // did not even get mode, nothing to see here
                       continue;
                   }
                   if (0 &gt; gps_data.fix.mode ||
                       MODE_STR_NUM &lt;= gps_data.fix.mode) {
                       gps_data.fix.mode = 0;
                   }
                   printf("Fix mode: %s (%d) Time: ",
                          mode_str[gps_data.fix.mode],
                          gps_data.fix.mode);
                   if (TIME_SET == (TIME_SET &amp; gps_data.set)) {
                       // not 32 bit safe
                       printf("%ld.%09ld ", gps_data.fix.time.tv_sec,
                              gps_data.fix.time.tv_nsec);
                   } else {
                       puts("n/a ");
                   }
                   if (isfinite(gps_data.fix.latitude) &amp;&amp;
                       isfinite(gps_data.fix.longitude)) {
                       // Display data from the GPS receiver if valid.
                       printf("Lat %.6f Lon %.6f\n",
                              gps_data.fix.latitude, gps_data.fix.longitude);
                   } else {
                       printf("Lat n/a Lon n/a\n");
                   }

               (void)gps_stream(&amp;gps_data, WATCH_DISABLE, NULL);
               (void)gps_close(&amp;gps_data);
               return 0;
           }

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       On some systems (those which do not support implicit linking in libraries) you may need to add <b>-lm</b> to
       your link line when you link libgps. It is always safe to do this.

       In the C API, incautious use of <b>gps_send()</b> may lead to subtle bugs. In order to not bloat struct
       <b>gps_data_t</b> with space used by responses that are not expected to be shipped in close sequence with each
       other, the storage for fields associated with certain responses are combined in a union.

       The risky set of responses includes VERSION, DEVICELIST, RTCM2, RTCM3, SUBFRAME, AIS, GST, and ERROR; it
       may not be limited to that set. The logic of the <b>gpsd</b> daemonâ€™s watcher mode is careful to avoid dangerous
       sequences, but you should read and understand the layout of struct <b>gps_data_t</b> before using <b>gps_send()</b> to
       request any of these responses.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>gps_query()</b> supported in major versions 1 and 2 of this library has been removed. With the new
       streaming-oriented wire protocol behind this library, it is extremely unwise to assume that the first
       transmission from the <b>gpsd</b> daemon after a command is shipped to it will be the response to command.

       If you must send commands to the <b>gpsd</b> daemon explicitly, use <b>gps_send()</b> but beware that this ties your
       code to the GPSD wire protocol. It is not recommended.

       In some versions of the API <b>gps_read()</b> is a blocking call and there was a POLL_NONBLOCK option to make it
       nonblocking. <b>gps_waiting()</b> was added to reduce the number of wrong ways to code a polling loop.

       See the comment above the symbol GPSD_API_MAJOR_VERSION in <b>gps.h</b> for recent changes.
