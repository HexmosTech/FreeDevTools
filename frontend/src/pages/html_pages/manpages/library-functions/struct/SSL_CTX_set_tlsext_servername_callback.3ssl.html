       SSL_get_servername, SSL_set_tlsext_host_name - handle server name indication (SNI)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

        long SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback(SSL_CTX *ctx,
                                          int (*cb)(SSL *s, int *al, void *arg));
        long SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_arg(SSL_CTX *ctx, void *arg);

        const char *SSL_get_servername(const SSL *s, const int type);
        int SSL_get_servername_type(const SSL *s);

        int SSL_set_tlsext_host_name(const SSL *s, const char *name);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The functionality provided by the servername callback is mostly superseded by the ClientHello callback,
       which can be set using <b>SSL_CTX_set_client_hello_cb()</b>.  However, even where the ClientHello callback is
       used, the servername callback is still necessary in order to acknowledge the servername requested by the
       client.

       <b>SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback()</b> sets the application callback <b>cb</b> used by a server to perform any
       actions or configuration required based on the servername extension received in the incoming connection.
       When <b>cb</b> is NULL, SNI is not used.

       The servername callback should return one of the following values:

       SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK
           This  is  used to indicate that the servername requested by the client has been accepted. Typically a
           server will call <b>SSL_set_SSL_CTX()</b> in the callback to  set  up  a  different  configuration  for  the
           selected servername in this case.

       SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL
           In  this  case  the  servername  requested  by  the  client is not accepted and the handshake will be
           aborted. The value of the alert to be used should be stored in the location  pointed  to  by  the  <b>al</b>
           parameter to the callback. By default this value is initialised to SSL_AD_UNRECOGNIZED_NAME.

       SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_WARNING
           If  this value is returned then the servername is not accepted by the server.  However, the handshake
           will continue and send a warning alert instead. The value of  the  alert  should  be  stored  in  the
           location  pointed  to  by the <b>al</b> parameter as for SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL above. Note that TLSv1.3
           does not support warning alerts, so if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated then this return value is  treated
           the same way as SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_NOACK.

       SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_NOACK
           This  return  value  indicates that the servername is not accepted by the server.  No alerts are sent
           and the server will not acknowledge the requested servername.

       <b>SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_arg()</b> sets a context-specific argument to be passed into the callback  (via
       the <b>arg</b> parameter) for this <b>SSL_CTX</b>.

       The  behaviour of <b>SSL_get_servername()</b> depends on a number of different factors.  In particular note that
       in TLSv1.3 the servername is negotiated in every handshake. In TLSv1.2 the servername is only  negotiated
       on initial handshakes and not on resumption handshakes.

       On the client, before the handshake
           If  a  servername  has  been  set  via  a call to <b>SSL_set_tlsext_host_name()</b> then it will return that
           servername.

           If one has not been set, but a TLSv1.2 resumption  is  being  attempted  and  the  session  from  the
           original handshake had a servername accepted by the server then it will return that servername.

           Otherwise it returns NULL.

       On the client, during or after the handshake and a TLSv1.2 (or below) resumption occurred
           If  the  session  from  the  original  handshake had a servername accepted by the server then it will
           return that servername.

           Otherwise it returns the servername set via <b>SSL_set_tlsext_host_name()</b> or NULL if it was not called.

       On the client, during or after the handshake and a TLSv1.2 (or below) resumption did not occur
           It will return the servername set via <b>SSL_set_tlsext_host_name()</b> or NULL if it was not called.

       On the server, before the handshake
           The function will always return NULL before the handshake

       On the server, after the servername extension has been processed and a TLSv1.2 (or below) resumption
       occurred
           If a servername was accepted by the server in  the  original  handshake  then  it  will  return  that
           servername, or NULL otherwise.

       On the server, after the servername extension has been processed and a TLSv1.2 (or below) resumption did
       not occur
           The function will return the servername requested by the client in this handshake or NULL if none was
           requested.

       Note that the ClientHello callback occurs before a servername extension from the client is processed. The
       servername,  certificate  and  ALPN  callbacks  occur  after  a  servername  extension from the client is
       processed.

       <b>SSL_get_servername_type()</b> returns the servername type or -1 if no servername is  present.  Currently  the
       only supported type (defined in RFC3546) is <b>TLSEXT_NAMETYPE_host_name</b>.

       <b>SSL_set_tlsext_host_name()</b>  sets  the  server  name indication ClientHello extension to contain the value
       <b>name</b>. The type of server name indication  extension  is  set  to  <b>TLSEXT_NAMETYPE_host_name</b>  (defined  in
       RFC3546).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Several  callbacks  are  executed  during  ClientHello  processing,  including the ClientHello, ALPN, and
       servername callbacks.  The ClientHello callback is executed first, then the servername callback, followed
       by the ALPN callback.

       The <b>SSL_set_tlsext_host_name()</b> function should only be called on SSL objects that will  act  as  clients;
       otherwise the configured <b>name</b> will be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback()</b>  and  <b>SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_arg()</b>  both  always return 1
       indicating success.  <b>SSL_set_tlsext_host_name()</b> returns 1 on success, 0 in case of error.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_get_servername()</b> historically provided some unexpected results in certain corner cases. This has been
       fixed from OpenSSL 1.1.1e.

       Prior to 1.1.1e, when the client requested a servername in  an  initial  TLSv1.2  handshake,  the  server
       accepted  it,  and  then  the  client successfully resumed but set a different explicit servername in the
       second handshake then when called by the client it returned the servername  from  the  second  handshake.
       This has now been changed to return the servername requested in the original handshake.

       Also  prior  to  1.1.1e,  if  the  client sent a servername in the first handshake but the server did not
       accept it, and then a second handshake occurred where TLSv1.2 resumption was successful then when  called
       by  the  server it returned the servername requested in the original handshake. This has now been changed
       to NULL.
