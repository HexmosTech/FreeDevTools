       PS_open_image — Reads an image for later placement

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;pslib.h&gt;

       int  PS_open_image(PSDoc *psdoc, char *type, char *source, char *data, int lenght, int width, int height,
       int components, int bpc, const char *params)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Reads an image which is already available in memory. The parameter <b>source</b> is currently not evaluated  and
       assumed  to  be  `memory'.  The  parameter  <b>type</b>  can  be either `raw' or `eps'. Images in raw format are
       expected to be a stream of pixels starting in the upper left and ending in the lower right  corner.  Each
       pixel  is a tuple of components representing the colors. Each component consists of <b>bpc</b> bit. Color imgags
       expect the components to be stored in RGB or CMYK order. The number of components implies the colorspace.
       4 components imply a CMYK image and not an RGB image with an  alpha  channel.  This  restriction  may  be
       removed in later versions.

       EPS  images  are  expect  as stored in a file. There is no need to set any other paramter. The height und
       width of the image is taken from the bounding box within the image data.

       Since version 0.4.5 of pslib images are read by default for later reuse. This means  that  the  image  is
       saved into a so called reusable stream object. Later calls of <b><a href="../man3/PS_place_image.3.html">PS_place_image</a>(3)</b>             will only put
       a  short  sequence of postscript code into the output file replaying the image.  This reduces the overall
       postscript file size, speeds up its processing by the postscript rip and  allows  to  place  images  into
       templates.  This  behaviour  can  be  turned  off  by  setting  the  parameter `imagereuse' to false with
       <b><a href="../man3/PS_set_parameter.3.html">PS_set_parameter</a>(3)</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns identifier of the image or zero in case of an error.  The identifier is a positiv number  greater
       0.
