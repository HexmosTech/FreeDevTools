       explain_open - explain <a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a>(2) errors

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;libexplain/open.h&gt;
       const char *explain_open(const char *pathname, int flags, int mode);
       const char *explain_errno_open(int errnum, const char *pathname, int flags, int mode);
       void explain_message_open(char *message, int message_size, const char *pathname, int flags, int mode);
       void  explain_message_errno_open(char  *message,  int message_size, int errnum, const char *pathname, int
       flags, int mode);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These functions may be used to obtains explanations for <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) errors.

   <b>explain_open(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*pathname,</b> <b>int</b> <b>flags,</b> <b>int</b> <b>mode);</b>
       const char *explain_open(const char *pathname, int flags, int mode);

       The explain_open function is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned  by  the  <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2)  system
       call.   The  least  the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it will do much
       better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              int fd = open(pathname, flags, mode);
              if (fd &lt; 0)
              {
                  fprintf(stderr, '%s0, explain_open(pathname, flags, mode));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>pathname</u>
               The original pathname, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>flags</u>   The original flags, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>mode</u>    The original mode, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) system call (or zero  if  the  original  call
               didn't need a mode argument).

       Returns:
               The  message  explaining  the  error.   This message buffer is shared by all libexplain functions
               which do not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the  next  call
               to any libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b>  This  function  is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all threads, and many
       other functions in this library.

   <b>explain_errno_open</b>
       const char *explain_errno_open(int errnum, const char *pathname, int flags, int mode);

       The explain_errno_open function is used to obtain an explanation of an  error  returned  by  the  <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2)
       system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errnum), but usually it will do
       much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              int fd = open(pathname, flags, mode);
              if (fd &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  fprintf(stderr, '%s0, explain_errno_open(err, pathname,
                      flags, mode));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>errnum</u>  The  error  value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just before this
               function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>pathname</u>
               The original pathname, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>flags</u>   The original flags, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>mode</u>    The original mode, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) system call (or zero  if  the  original  call
               didn't need a mode argument).

       Returns:
               The  message  explaining  the  error.   This message buffer is shared by all libexplain functions
               which do not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the  next  call
               to any libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b>  This  function  is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all threads, and many
       other functions in this library.

   <b>explain_message_open</b>
       void explain_message_open(char *message, int message_size, const char *pathname, int flags, int mode);

       The explain_message_open function is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned  by  the  <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2)
       system  call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it will do
       much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              int fd = open(pathname, flags, mode);
              if (fd &lt; 0)
              {
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_open(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), pathname, flags,
                      mode);
                  fprintf(stderr, '%s0, message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>message</u> The location in which to store the returned message.  Because a message return  buffer  has  been
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>pathname</u>
               The original pathname, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>flags</u>   The original flags, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>mode</u>    The  original  mode,  exactly  as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) system call (or zero if the original call
               didn't need a mode argument).

   <b>explain_message_errno_open</b>
       void explain_message_errno_open(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, const  char  *pathname,  int
       flags, int mode);

       The  explain_message_errno_open  function  is  used  to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the
       <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errnum), but usually it
       will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following exameple:
              int fd = open(pathname, flags, mode);
              if (fd &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_errno_open(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), err, pathname,
                      flags, mode);
                  fprintf(stderr, '%s0, message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>message</u> The location in which to store the returned message.  Because a message return  buffer  has  been
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>errnum</u>  The  error  value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just before this
               function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>pathname</u>
               The original pathname, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>flags</u>   The original flags, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>mode</u>    The original mode, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></u>(2) system call (or zero  if  the  original  call
               didn't need a mode argument).
