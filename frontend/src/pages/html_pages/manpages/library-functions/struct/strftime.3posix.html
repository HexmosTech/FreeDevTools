       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       strftime, strftime_l — convert date and time to a string

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/time.h">time.h</a>&gt;

       size_t strftime(char *restrict <u>s</u>, size_t <u>maxsize</u>,
           const char *restrict <u>format</u>, const struct tm *restrict <u>timeptr</u>);
       size_t strftime_l(char *restrict <u>s</u>, size_t <u>maxsize</u>,
           const char *restrict <u>format</u>, const struct tm *restrict <u>timeptr</u>,
           locale_t <u>locale</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For  <u>strftime</u>():  The  functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard.
       Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <u>strftime</u>() function shall place bytes into the array pointed to by <u>s</u>  as  controlled  by  the  string
       pointed to by <u>format</u>.  The format is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state,
       if any. The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifications and ordinary characters.

       Each  conversion  specification  is  introduced  by the <b>'%'</b> character after which the following appear in
       sequence:

        *  An optional flag:

           0     The zero character (<b>'0'</b>), which specifies that the character used as the padding  character  is
                 <b>'0'</b>,

           +     The  &lt;plus-sign&gt;  character  (<b>'+'</b>),  which  specifies  that  the  character used as the padding
                 character is <b>'0'</b>, and that if and only if the field being  produced  consumes  more  than  four
                 bytes  to  represent  a  year  (for <b>%F</b>, <b>%G</b>, or <b>%Y</b>) or more than two bytes to represent the year
                 divided by 100 (for <b>%C</b>) then a leading &lt;plus-sign&gt; character shall  be  included  if  the  year
                 being  processed  is  greater than or equal to zero or a leading &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; character (<b>'-'</b>)
                 shall be included if the year is less than zero.

           The default padding character is unspecified.

        *  An optional minimum field width. If the converted value, including any leading <b>'+'</b> or <b>'-'</b>  sign,  has
           fewer  bytes  than  the  minimum  field width and the padding character is not the NUL character, the
           output shall be padded on the left (after any leading <b>'+'</b> or <b>'-'</b> sign) with the padding character.

        *  An optional <b>E</b> or <b>O</b> modifier.

        *  A terminating conversion specifier character that indicates the type of conversion to be applied.

       The results are unspecified if more than one flag character is specified, a flag character  is  specified
       without a minimum field width; a minimum field width is specified without a flag character; a modifier is
       specified  with  a  flag  or with a minimum field width; or if a minimum field width is specified for any
       conversion specifier other than <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, or <b>Y</b>.

       All ordinary characters (including the terminating NUL character) are copied unchanged into the array. If
       copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined. No more than  maxsize  bytes
       are  placed  into the array. Each conversion specifier is replaced by appropriate characters as described
       in the following list. The appropriate characters are  determined  using  the  <u>LC_TIME</u>  category  of  the
       current  locale and by the values of zero or more members of the broken-down time structure pointed to by
       <u>timeptr</u>, as specified in brackets in the description. If any of the  specified  values  are  outside  the
       normal range, the characters stored are unspecified.

       The  <u>strftime_l</u>()  function  shall  be equivalent to the <u>strftime</u>() function, except that the locale data
       used is from the locale represented by <u>locale</u>.

       Local timezone information is used as though <u>strftime</u>() called <u>tzset</u>().

       The following conversion specifiers shall be supported:

       a       Replaced by the locale's abbreviated weekday name. [<u>tm_wday</u>]

       A       Replaced by the locale's full weekday name. [<u>tm_wday</u>]

       b       Replaced by the locale's abbreviated month name. [<u>tm_mon</u>]

       B       Replaced by the locale's full month name. [<u>tm_mon</u>]

       c       Replaced by the locale's appropriate date and time representation.   (See  the  Base  Definitions
               volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>&lt;time.h&gt;</u>.)

       C       Replaced by the year divided by 100 and truncated to an integer, as a decimal number. [<u>tm_year</u>]

               If a minimum field width is not specified, the number of characters placed into the array pointed
               to by <u>s</u> will be the number of digits in the year divided by 100 or two, whichever is greater.  If
               a  minimum field width is specified, the number of characters placed into the array pointed to by
               <u>s</u> will be the number of digits in the year divided by 100 or the minimum field  width,  whichever
               is greater.

       d       Replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number [01,31]. [<u>tm_mday</u>]

       D       Equivalent to <b>%m</b>/<b>%d</b>/<b>%y</b>.  [<u>tm_mon</u>, <u>tm_mday</u>, <u>tm_year</u>]

       e       Replaced  by  the  day  of  the month as a decimal number [1,31]; a single digit is preceded by a
               space. [<u>tm_mday</u>]

       F       Equivalent to %+4Y-%m-%d if no flag and no minimum field width are specified.  [<u>tm_year</u>,  <u>tm_mon</u>,
               <u>tm_mday</u>]

               If  a  minimum  field  width of <u>x</u> is specified, the year shall be output as if by the <b>Y</b> specifier
               (described below) with whatever flag was given and a minimum field width of <u>x</u>-6.  If  <u>x</u>  is  less
               than 6, the behavior shall be as if <u>x</u> equalled 6.

               If  the  minimum  field  width  is specified to be 10, and the year is four digits long, then the
               output  string  produced  will  match  the  ISO 8601:2004  standard  subclause  4.1.2.2  complete
               representation,  extended format date representation of a specific day. If a + flag is specified,
               a minimum field width of <u>x</u> is specified, and <u>x</u>-7 bytes are sufficient to hold the digits  of  the
               year  (not  including  any  needed  sign character), then the output will match the ISO 8601:2004
               standard subclause 4.1.2.4 complete representation, expanded  format  date  representation  of  a
               specific day.

       g       Replaced  by  the  last  2 digits of the week-based year (see below) as a decimal number [00,99].
               [<u>tm_year</u>, <u>tm_wday</u>, <u>tm_yday</u>]

       G       Replaced by the week-based year (see below) as a decimal number (for  example,  1977).  [<u>tm_year</u>,
               <u>tm_wday</u>, <u>tm_yday</u>]

               If  a minimum field width is specified, the number of characters placed into the array pointed to
               by <u>s</u> will be the number of digits and leading sign characters  (if  any)  in  the  year,  or  the
               minimum field width, whichever is greater.

       h       Equivalent to <b>%b</b>.  [<u>tm_mon</u>]

       H       Replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number [00,23]. [<u>tm_hour</u>]

       I       Replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number [01,12]. [<u>tm_hour</u>]

       j       Replaced by the day of the year as a decimal number [001,366]. [<u>tm_yday</u>]

       m       Replaced by the month as a decimal number [01,12]. [<u>tm_mon</u>]

       M       Replaced by the minute as a decimal number [00,59]. [<u>tm_min</u>]

       n       Replaced by a &lt;newline&gt;.

       p       Replaced by the locale's equivalent of either a.m. or p.m. [<u>tm_hour</u>]

       r       Replaced  by  the time in a.m. and p.m. notation; in the POSIX locale this shall be equivalent to
               <b>%I</b>:<b>%M</b>:<b>%S</b> <b>%p</b>.  [<u>tm_hour</u>, <u>tm_min</u>, <u>tm_sec</u>]

       R       Replaced by the time in 24-hour notation (<b>%H</b>:<b>%M</b>).  [<u>tm_hour</u>, <u>tm_min</u>]

       S       Replaced by the second as a decimal number [00,60]. [<u>tm_sec</u>]

       t       Replaced by a &lt;tab&gt;.

       T       Replaced by the time (<b>%H</b>:<b>%M</b>:<b>%S</b>).  [<u>tm_hour</u>, <u>tm_min</u>, <u>tm_sec</u>]

       u       Replaced by the weekday as a decimal number [1,7], with 1 representing Monday. [<u>tm_wday</u>]

       U       Replaced by the week number of the year as a decimal number [00,53].  The first Sunday of January
               is the first day of week 1; days in the new year before this are in week  0.  [<u>tm_year</u>,  <u>tm_wday</u>,
               <u>tm_yday</u>]

       V       Replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number
               [01,53].  If  the  week  containing  1  January has four or more days in the new year, then it is
               considered week 1.  Otherwise, it is the last week of the previous year, and  the  next  week  is
               week  1.  Both  January  4th  and  the  first Thursday of January are always in week 1. [<u>tm_year</u>,
               <u>tm_wday</u>, <u>tm_yday</u>]

       w       Replaced by the weekday as a decimal number [0,6], with 0 representing Sunday. [<u>tm_wday</u>]

       W       Replaced by the week number of the year as a decimal number [00,53].  The first Monday of January
               is the first day of week 1; days in the new year before this are in week  0.  [<u>tm_year</u>,  <u>tm_wday</u>,
               <u>tm_yday</u>]

       x       Replaced  by  the  locale's  appropriate date representation. (See the Base Definitions volume of
               POSIX.1‐2017, <u>&lt;time.h&gt;</u>.)

       X       Replaced by the locale's appropriate time representation. (See the  Base  Definitions  volume  of
               POSIX.1‐2017, <u>&lt;time.h&gt;</u>.)

       y       Replaced by the last two digits of the year as a decimal number [00,99]. [<u>tm_year</u>]

       Y       Replaced by the year as a decimal number (for example, 1997). [<u>tm_year</u>]

               If  a minimum field width is specified, the number of characters placed into the array pointed to
               by <u>s</u> will be the number of digits and leading sign characters  (if  any)  in  the  year,  or  the
               minimum field width, whichever is greater.

       z       Replaced  by  the offset from UTC in the ISO 8601:2004 standard format (<b>+hhmm</b> or <b>-hhmm</b>), or by no
               characters if no timezone is determinable. For example, <b>"-0430"</b> means 4 hours 30  minutes  behind
               UTC  (west  of Greenwich).  If <u>tm_isdst</u> is zero, the standard time offset is used. If <u>tm_isdst</u> is
               greater than zero, the daylight savings  time  offset  is  used.  If  <u>tm_isdst</u>  is  negative,  no
               characters are returned.  [<u>tm_isdst</u>]

       Z       Replaced  by the timezone name or abbreviation, or by no bytes if no timezone information exists.
               [<u>tm_isdst</u>]

       %       Replaced by <b>%</b>.

       If a conversion specification does not correspond to any of the above, the behavior is undefined.

       If a <b>struct</b> <b>tm</b> broken-down time structure is created by <u>localtime</u>()  or  <u>localtime_r</u>(),  or  modified  by
       <u>mktime</u>(),  and  the  value  of  <u>TZ</u>  is  subsequently  modified,  the  results of the <b>%Z</b> and <b>%z</b> <u>strftime</u>()
       conversion specifiers are undefined, when <u>strftime</u>() is called with such a broken-down time structure.

       If a <b>struct</b> <b>tm</b> broken-down time structure is created  or  modified  by  <u>gmtime</u>()  or  <u>gmtime_r</u>(),  it  is
       unspecified  whether  the result of the <b>%Z</b> and <b>%z</b> conversion specifiers shall refer to UTC or the current
       local timezone, when <u>strftime</u>() is called with such a broken-down time structure.

   <b>Modified</b> <b>Conversion</b> <b>Specifiers</b>
       Some conversion specifiers can be modified by the  <b>E</b>  or  <b>O</b>  modifier  characters  to  indicate  that  an
       alternative  format  or  specification should be used rather than the one normally used by the unmodified
       conversion specifier. If the alternative format or specification does not exist for  the  current  locale
       (see  ERA  in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>7.3.5</u>, <u>LC_TIME</u>), the behavior shall be
       as if the unmodified conversion specification were used.

       %Ec     Replaced by the locale's alternative appropriate date and time representation.

       %EC     Replaced by the name of the base year (period) in the locale's alternative representation.

       %Ex     Replaced by the locale's alternative date representation.

       %EX     Replaced by the locale's alternative time representation.

       %Ey     Replaced by the offset from <b>%EC</b> (year only) in the locale's alternative representation.

       %EY     Replaced by the full alternative year representation.

       %Od     Replaced by the day of the month, using the  locale's  alternative  numeric  symbols,  filled  as
               needed  with  leading  zeros if there is any alternative symbol for zero; otherwise, with leading
               &lt;space&gt; characters.

       %Oe     Replaced by the day of the month, using the  locale's  alternative  numeric  symbols,  filled  as
               needed with leading &lt;space&gt; characters.

       %OH     Replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OI     Replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %Om     Replaced by the month using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OM     Replaced by the minutes using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OS     Replaced by the seconds using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %Ou     Replaced by the weekday as a number in the locale's alternative representation (Monday=1).

       %OU     Replaced by the week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of the week, rules corresponding
               to <b>%U</b>) using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OV     Replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week, rules corresponding
               to <b>%V</b>) using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %Ow     Replaced by the number of the weekday (Sunday=0) using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OW     Replaced  by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) using the locale's
               alternative numeric symbols.

       %Oy     Replaced by the year (offset from <b>%C</b>) using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       <b>%g</b>, <b>%G</b>, and <b>%V</b> give values according to the ISO 8601:2004 standard week-based year. In this system, weeks
       begin on a Monday and week 1 of the year is the week that includes January 4th, which is  also  the  week
       that includes the first Thursday of the year, and is also the first week that contains at least four days
       in  the  year. If the first Monday of January is the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th, the preceding days are part of the
       last week of the preceding year; thus, for Saturday 2nd January 1999, <b>%G</b> is replaced by 1998  and  <b>%V</b>  is
       replaced by 53. If December 29th, 30th, or 31st is a Monday, it and any following days are part of week 1
       of the following year. Thus, for Tuesday 30th December 1997, <b>%G</b> is replaced by 1998 and <b>%V</b> is replaced by
       01.

       If a conversion specifier is not one of the above, the behavior is undefined.

       The  behavior  is  undefined  if  the  <u>locale</u>  argument  to  <u>strftime_l</u>()  is  the  special locale object
       LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale object handle.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       If the total number of resulting bytes including the terminating null byte  is  not  more  than  <u>maxsize</u>,
       these functions shall return the number of bytes placed into the array pointed to by <u>s</u>, not including the
       terminating NUL character. Otherwise, 0 shall be returned and the contents of the array are unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>Localized</b> <b>Date</b> <b>String</b>
       The following example first sets the locale to the user's default. The locale information will be used in
       the  <u>nl_langinfo</u>() and <u>strftime</u>() functions. The <u>nl_langinfo</u>() function returns the localized date string
       which specifies how the date is laid out. The <u>strftime</u>() function takes this information and,  using  the
       <b>tm</b> structure for values, places the date and time information into <u>datestring</u>.

           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/time.h">time.h</a>&gt;
           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/locale.h">locale.h</a>&gt;
           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/langinfo.h">langinfo.h</a>&gt;
           ...
           struct tm *tm;
           char datestring[256];
           ...
           setlocale (LC_ALL, "");
           ...
           strftime (datestring, sizeof(datestring), nl_langinfo (D_T_FMT), tm);
           ...

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The range of values for <b>%S</b> is [00,60] rather than [00,59] to allow for the occasional leap second.

       Some  of the conversion specifications are duplicates of others. They are included for compatibility with
       <u>nl_cxtime</u>() and <u>nl_ascxtime</u>(), which were published in Issue 2.

       The <b>%C</b>, <b>%F</b>, <b>%G</b>, and <b>%Y</b> format specifiers in <u>strftime</u>() always print full values, but the  <u>strptime</u>()  <b>%C</b>,
       <b>%F</b>,  and  <b>%Y</b>  format  specifiers only scan two digits (assumed to be the first two digits of a four-digit
       year) for <b>%C</b> and four digits (assumed to be the entire (four-digit) year) for <b>%F</b> and <b>%Y</b>.  This mimics the
       behavior of <u>printf</u>() and <u>scanf</u>(); that is:

           printf("%2d", x = 1000);

       prints <b>"1000"</b>, but:

           scanf(%2d", &amp;x);

       when given <b>"1000"</b> as input will only store 10 in <u>x</u>).  Applications using extended ranges of years must be
       sure that the number of digits specified for scanning years with <u>strptime</u>() matches the number of  digits
       that  will  actually  be  present  in  the  input  stream.  Historic implementations of the <b>%Y</b> conversion
       specification (with no flags and no minimum field width) produced different output formats.  Some  always
       produced  at  least four digits (with 0 fill for years from 0 through 999) while others only produced the
       number of digits present in the year (with no fill and no padding). These two forms can be produced  with
       the  <b>'0'</b>  flag  and  a  minimum  field  width options using the conversions specifications <b>%04Y</b> and <b>%01Y</b>,
       respectively.

       In the past, the C and POSIX standards specified that <b>%F</b> produced an ISO 8601:2004 standard date  format,
       but  didn't  specify which one. For years in the range [0001,9999], POSIX.1‐2008 requires that the output
       produced match the ISO 8601:2004 standard complete representation extended format  (YYYY-MM-DD)  and  for
       years   outside   of  this  range  produce  output  that  matches  the  ISO 8601:2004  standard  expanded
       representation extended format (&lt;+/-&gt;&lt;Underline&gt;Y&lt;/Underline&gt;YYYY-MM-DD).  To  fully  meet  ISO 8601:2004
       standard  requirements,  the producer and consumer must agree on a date format that has a specific number
       of bytes reserved to hold the characters used to represent the years that is sufficiently large  to  hold
       all  values  that  will  be  shared.  For example, the <b>%+13F</b> conversion specification will produce output
       matching the format <b>"&lt;+/-&gt;YYYYYY-MM-DD"</b> (a leading <b>'+'</b> or <b>'-'</b> sign; a six-digit, 0-filled year; a <b>'-'</b>;  a
       two-digit,  leading  0-filled  month;  another  <b>'-'</b>;  and  the two-digit, leading 0-filled day within the
       month).

       Note that if the year being printed is greater than 9999, the resulting  string  from  the  unadorned  <b>%F</b>
       conversion  specifications  will  not  conform  to  the  ISO 8601:2004 standard extended format, complete
       representation for a date and will instead be an extended  format,  expanded  representation  (presumably
       without the required agreement between the date's producer and consumer).

       In the C or POSIX locale, the <b>E</b> and <b>O</b> modifiers are ignored and the replacement strings for the following
       specifiers are:

       %a      The first three characters of <b>%A</b>.

       %A      One of Sunday, Monday, ..., Saturday.

       %b      The first three characters of <b>%B</b>.

       %B      One of January, February, ..., December.

       %c      Equivalent to <b>%a</b> <b>%b</b> <b>%e</b> <b>%T</b> <b>%Y</b>.

       %p      One of AM or PM.

       %r      Equivalent to <b>%I</b>:<b>%M</b>:<b>%S</b> <b>%p</b>.

       %x      Equivalent to <b>%m</b>/<b>%d</b>/<b>%y</b>.

       %X      Equivalent to <b>%T</b>.

       %Z      Implementation-defined.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>%Y</b>  conversion  specification  to <u>strftime</u>() was frequently assumed to be a four-digit year, but the
       ISO C standard does not specify that <b>%Y</b> is restricted to any subset of allowed values  from  the  <u>tm_year</u>
       field.  Similarly, the <b>%C</b> conversion specification was assumed to be a two-digit field and the first part
       of the output from the <b>%F</b> conversion specification was assumed to be a  four-digit  field.  With  <u>tm_year</u>
       being a signed 32 or more-bit <b>int</b> and with many current implementations supporting 64-bit <b>time_t</b> types in
       one or more programming environments, these assumptions are clearly wrong.

       POSIX.1‐2008  now  allows  the format specifications <b>%0xC</b>, <b>%0xF</b>, <b>%0xG</b>, and <b>%0xY</b> (where <b>'x'</b> is a string of
       decimal digits used to specify printing and scanning of a string of <u>x</u> decimal digits) with  leading  zero
       fill  characters.  Allowing  applications  to  set the field width enables them to agree on the number of
       digits to be printed and scanned in the ISO 8601:2004 standard expanded representation of a year (for <b>%F</b>,
       <b>%G</b>, and <b>%Y</b>) or all but the last two digits of the year (for <b>%C</b>).  This is based  on  a  feature  in  some
       versions  of GNU <b>libc</b>'s <u>strftime</u>().  The GNU version allows specifying space, zero, or no-fill characters
       in <u>strftime</u>() format strings, but does not allow any flags to be specified in <u>strptime</u>() format  strings.
       These  implementations  also  allow  these flags to be specified for any numeric field. POSIX.1‐2008 only
       requires the zero fill flag (<b>'0'</b>) and only requires that it be recognized when processing <b>%C</b>, <b>%F</b>, <b>%G</b>, and
       <b>%Y</b> specifications when a minimum field width is also specified. The <b>'0'</b> flag is the only flag  needed  to
       produce  and  scan  the  ISO 8601:2004 standard year fields using the extended format forms. POSIX.1‐2008
       also allows applications to specify the same  flag  and  field  width  specifiers  to  be  used  in  both
       <u>strftime</u>()  and <u>strptime</u>() format strings for symmetry. Systems may provide other flag characters and may
       accept flags in conjunction with conversion specifiers other than  <b>%C</b>,  <b>%F</b>,  <b>%G</b>,  and  <b>%Y</b>;  but  portable
       applications cannot depend on such extensions.

       POSIX.1‐2008  now also allows the format specifications <b>%+xC</b>, <b>%+xF</b>, <b>%+xG</b>, and <b>%+xY</b> (where <b>'x'</b> is a string
       of decimal digits used to specify printing and scanning of a string of <b>'x'</b> decimal digits)  with  leading
       zero  fill  characters  and  a  leading  <b>'+'</b> sign character if the year being converted is more than four
       digits or a minimum field width is specified that allows room for more than four  digits  for  the  year.
       This  allows  date providers and consumers to agree on a specific number of digits to represent a year as
       required by the ISO 8601:2004 standard  expanded  representation  formats.  The  expanded  representation
       formats  all require the year to begin with a leading <b>'+'</b> or <b>'-'</b> sign.  (All of these specifiers can also
       provide a leading <b>'-'</b> sign for negative years. Since negative years and the year 0 don't  fit  well  with
       the  Gregorian  or  Julian  calendars,  the  normal ranges of dates start with year 1. The ISO C standard
       allows <u>tm_year</u> to assume values corresponding to years before year 1, but the use of such years  provided
       unspecified results.)

       Some earlier version of this standard specified that applications wanting to use <u>strptime</u>() to scan dates
       and times printed by <u>strftime</u>() should provide non-digit characters between fields to separate years from
       months  and  days.  It  also  supported  <b>%F</b> to print and scan the ISO 8601:2004 standard extended format,
       complete representation date for years 1 through 9999 (i.e., YYYY-MM-DD). However, many applications were
       written to print (using <u>strftime</u>()) and scan (using <u>strptime</u>()) dates  written  using  the  basic  format
       complete  representation  (four-digit  years) and truncated representation (two-digit years) specified by
       the ISO 8601:2004 standard representation of dates and times which do not have any separation  characters
       between  fields. The ISO 8601:2004 standard also specifies basic format expanded representation where the
       creator and consumer of these fields agree beforehand to represent years as leading  zero-filled  strings
       of  an  agreed  length  of more than four digits to represent a year (again with no separation characters
       when  year,  month,  and  day  are  all  displayed).  Applications  producing  and   consuming   expanded
       representations  are  encouraged  to  use the <b>'+'</b> flag and an appropriate maximum field width to scan the
       year including the leading sign. Note that even without the  <b>'+'</b>  flag,  years  less  than  zero  may  be
       represented  with  a  leading &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; for <b>%F</b>, <b>%G</b>, and <b>%Y</b> conversion specifications. Using negative
       years results in unspecified behavior.

       If a format specification <b>%+xF</b> with the field width <u>x</u> greater than 11 is specified and the width is large
       enough to display the full year, the  output  string  produced  will  match  the  ISO 8601:2004  standard
       subclause  4.1.2.4  expanded representation, extended format date representation for a specific day. (For
       years in the range [1,99999], <b>%+12F</b> is sufficient for an agreed five-digit year with a leading sign using
       the ISO 8601:2004 standard expanded representation, extended format for a  specific  day  <b>"&lt;+/-&gt;YYYYY-MM-</b>
       <b>DD"</b>.)   Note  also that years less than 0 may produce a leading &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; character (<b>'-'</b>) when using
       <b>%Y</b> or <b>%C</b> whether or not the <b>'0'</b> or <b>'+'</b> flags are used.

       The difference between the <b>'0'</b> flag and the <b>'+'</b> flag  is  whether  the  leading  <b>'+'</b>  character  will  be
       provided  for  years  &gt;9999  as  required  for  the ISO 8601:2004 standard extended representation format
       containing a year. For example:

       In the cases above marked with a * in the <u>strptime</u>() scan back field, the implied or specified number  of
       characters  scanned  by  <u>strptime</u>() was less than the number of characters output by <u>strftime</u>() using the
       same format; so the remaining digits of the year were dropped when the output date produced by <u>strftime</u>()
       was scanned back in by <u>strptime</u>().
