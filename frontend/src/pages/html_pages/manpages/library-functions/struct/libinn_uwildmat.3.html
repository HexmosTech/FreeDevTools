       uwildmat, uwildmat_simple, uwildmat_poison - Perform wildmat matching

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           #include &lt;inn/libinn.h&gt;

           bool uwildmat(const char *text, const char *pattern);

           bool uwildmat_simple(const char *text, const char *pattern);

           enum uwildmat uwildmat_poison(const char *text, const char *pattern);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>uwildmat</b> compares <u>text</u> against the wildmat expression <u>pattern</u>, returning true if and only if the
       expression matches the text.  "@" has no special meaning in <u>pattern</u> when passed to <b>uwildmat</b>.  Both <u>text</u>
       and <u>pattern</u> are assumed to be in the UTF-8 character encoding, although malformed UTF-8 sequences are
       treated in a way that attempts to be mostly compatible with single-octet character sets like ISO 8859-1.
       (In other words, if you try to match ISO 8859-1 text with these routines everything should work as
       expected unless the ISO 8859-1 text contains valid UTF-8 sequences, which thankfully is somewhat rare.)

       <b>uwildmat_simple</b> is identical to <b>uwildmat</b> except that neither "!"  nor "," have any special meaning and
       <u>pattern</u> is always treated as a single pattern.  This function exists solely to support legacy interfaces
       like NNTP's XPAT command, and should be avoided when implementing new features.

       <b>uwildmat_poison</b> works similarly to <b>uwildmat</b>, except that "@" as the first character of one of the
       patterns in the expression (see below) "poisons" the match if it matches.  <b>uwildmat_poison</b> returns
       <b>UWILDMAT_MATCH</b> if the expression matches the text, <b>UWILDMAT_FAIL</b> if it doesn't, and <b>UWILDMAT_POISON</b> if
       the expression doesn't match because a poisoned pattern matched the text.  These enumeration constants
       are defined in the <b>inn/libinn.h</b> header.

</pre><h4><b>WILDMAT</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A wildmat expression follows rules similar to those of shell filename wildcards but with some additions
       and changes.  A wildmat <u>expression</u> is composed of one or more wildmat <u>patterns</u> separated by commas.  Each
       character in the wildmat pattern matches a literal occurrence of that same character in the text, with
       the exception of the following metacharacters:

       ?       Matches any single character (including a single UTF-8 multibyte character, so "?" can match more
               than one byte).

       *       Matches any sequence of zero or more characters.

       \       Turns  off  any  special  meaning  of the following character; the following character will match
               itself in the text.  "\" will escape any character, including another backslash or a  comma  that
               otherwise  would separate a pattern from the next pattern in an expression.  Note that "\" is not
               special inside a character range (no metacharacters are).

       [...]   A character set, which matches any single character that falls within that set.  The presence  of
               a  character  between the brackets adds that character to the set; for example, "[amv]" specifies
               the set containing the characters "a", "m", and "v".  A range  of  characters  may  be  specified
               using "-"; for example, "[0-5abc]" is equivalent to "[012345abc]".  The order of characters is as
               defined  in  the  UTF-8 character set, and if the start character of such a range falls after the
               ending character of the range in that ranking the results of attempting a match with that pattern
               are undefined.

               In order to include a literal "]" character in the set, it must be the first character of the set
               (possibly following "^"); for example, "[]a]" matches either "]" or "a".  To  include  a  literal
               "-"  character  in  the  set,  it  must  be  either  the  first or the last character of the set.
               Backslashes have no special meaning inside a character set, nor  do  any  other  of  the  wildmat
               metacharacters.

       [^...]  A  negated  character  set.   Follows  the  same  rules as a character set above, but matches any
               character <b>not</b> contained in the set.  So, for example, "[^]-]" matches any  character  except  "]"
               and "-".

       In addition, "!" (and possibly "@") have special meaning as the first character of a pattern; see below.

       When  matching  a  wildmat expression against some text, each comma-separated pattern is matched in order
       from left to right.  In order to match, the pattern must match the  whole  text;  in  regular  expression
       terminology,  it's  implicitly  anchored at both the beginning and the end.  For example, the pattern "a"
       matches only the text "a"; it doesn't match "ab" or "ba" or even "aa".  If none of  the  patterns  match,
       the  whole expression doesn't match.  Otherwise, whether the expression matches is determined entirely by
       the rightmost matching pattern; the expression matches the text if and only  if  the  rightmost  matching
       pattern is not negated.

       For  example,  consider  the  text "news.misc".  The expression "*" matches this text, of course, as does
       "comp.*,news.*" (because the second pattern matches).   "news.*,!news.misc"  does  not  match  this  text
       because  both  patterns  match,  meaning  that the rightmost takes precedence, and the rightmost matching
       pattern is negated.  "news.*,!news.misc,*.misc" does  match  this  text,  since  the  rightmost  matching
       pattern is not negated.

       Note  that  the expression "!news.misc" can't match anything.  Either the pattern doesn't match, in which
       case no patterns match and the expression doesn't match, or the pattern does match, in which case because
       it's negated the expression doesn't match.  "*,!news.misc", on the other hand, is a useful  pattern  that
       matches anything except "news.misc".

       "!" has significance only as the first character of a pattern; anywhere else in the pattern, it matches a
       literal "!" in the text like any other non-metacharacter.

       If  the  <b>uwildmat_poison</b> interface is used, then "@" behaves the same as "!" except that if an expression
       fails to match because the rightmost matching pattern began with "@", <b>UWILDMAT_POISON</b> is returned instead
       of <b>UWILDMAT_FAIL</b>.

       If the <b>uwildmat_simple</b> interface is used, the matching rules are the same as above except  that  none  of
       "!", "@", or "," have any special meaning at all and only match those literal characters.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       All of these functions internally convert the passed arguments to const unsigned char pointers.  The only
       reason  why  they  take  regular char pointers instead of unsigned char is for the convenience of INN and
       other callers that may not be using unsigned char everywhere they should.   In  a  future  revision,  the
       public interface should be changed to just take unsigned char pointers.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Written  by  Rich  $alz &lt;<a href="mailto:rsalz@uunet.uu.net">rsalz@uunet.uu.net</a>&gt; in 1986, and posted to Usenet several times since then, most
       notably in comp.sources.misc in March, 1991.

       Lars Mathiesen &lt;<a href="mailto:thorinn@diku.dk">thorinn@diku.dk</a>&gt; enhanced the multi-asterisk failure mode in early 1991.

       Rich and Lars increased the efficiency of star patterns and reposted it to  comp.sources.misc  in  April,
       1991.

       Robert Elz &lt;<a href="mailto:kre@munnari.oz.au">kre@munnari.oz.au</a>&gt; added minus sign and close bracket handling in June, 1991.

       Russ  Allbery  &lt;<a href="mailto:eagle@eyrie.org">eagle@eyrie.org</a>&gt;  added  support  for  comma-separated  patterns  and  the  "!"  and  "@"
       metacharacters to the core wildmat routines in July, 2000.  He also added support for  UTF-8  characters,
       changed  the  default  behavior  to  assume  that both the text and the pattern are in UTF-8, and largely
       rewrote this documentation to expand and clarify the description of how a wildmat expression matches.

       Please note that the interfaces to these functions are named <b>uwildmat</b> and the like rather than <b>wildmat</b> to
       distinguish them from the <b>wildmat</b> function provided by Rich $alz's original implementation.   While  this
       code is heavily based on Rich's original code, it has substantial differences, including the extension to
       support UTF-8 characters, and has noticeable functionality changes.  Any bugs present in it aren't Rich's
       fault.
