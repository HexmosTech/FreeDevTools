</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SSL_set_num_tickets, SSL_get_num_tickets, SSL_CTX_set_num_tickets, SSL_CTX_get_num_tickets,
       SSL_new_session_ticket - control the number of TLSv1.3 session tickets that are issued

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

        int SSL_set_num_tickets(SSL *s, size_t num_tickets);
        size_t SSL_get_num_tickets(const SSL *s);
        int SSL_CTX_set_num_tickets(SSL_CTX *ctx, size_t num_tickets);
        size_t SSL_CTX_get_num_tickets(const SSL_CTX *ctx);
        int SSL_new_session_ticket(SSL *s);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_CTX_set_num_tickets()</b> and <b>SSL_set_num_tickets()</b> can be called for a server application and set the
       number of TLSv1.3 session tickets that will be sent to the client after a full handshake. Set the desired
       value (which could be 0) in the <b>num_tickets</b> argument. Typically these functions should be called before
       the start of the handshake.

       The default number of tickets is 2. Following a resumption the number of tickets issued will never be
       more than 1 regardless of the value set via <b>SSL_set_num_tickets()</b> or <b>SSL_CTX_set_num_tickets()</b>. If
       <b>num_tickets</b> is set to 0 then no tickets will be issued for either a normal connection or a resumption.

       Tickets are also issued on receipt of a post-handshake certificate from the client following a request by
       the server using <b><a href="../man3/SSL_verify_client_post_handshake.3.html">SSL_verify_client_post_handshake</a></b>(3). These new tickets will be associated with the
       updated client identity (i.e. including their certificate and verification status). The number of tickets
       issued will normally be the same as was used for the initial handshake. If the initial handshake was a
       full handshake then <b>SSL_set_num_tickets()</b> can be called again prior to calling
       <b>SSL_verify_client_post_handshake()</b> to update the number of tickets that will be sent.

       To issue tickets after other events (such as application-layer changes), <b>SSL_new_session_ticket()</b> is used
       by a server application to request that a new ticket be sent when it is safe to do so.  New tickets are
       only allowed to be sent in this manner after the initial handshake has completed, and only for TLS 1.3
       connections.  By default, the ticket generation and transmission are delayed until the server is starting
       a new write operation, so that it is bundled with other application data being written and properly
       aligned to a record boundary.  If the connection was at a record boundary when <b>SSL_new_session_ticket()</b>
       was called, the ticket can be sent immediately (without waiting for the next application write) by
       calling <b>SSL_do_handshake()</b>.  <b>SSL_new_session_ticket()</b> can be called more than once to request additional
       tickets be sent; all such requests are queued and written together when it is safe to do so and triggered
       by <b>SSL_write()</b> or <b>SSL_do_handshake()</b>.  Note that a successful return from <b>SSL_new_session_ticket()</b>
       indicates only that the request to send a ticket was processed, not that the ticket itself was sent.  To
       be notified when the ticket itself is sent, a new-session callback can be registered with
       <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_sess_set_new_cb.3.html">SSL_CTX_sess_set_new_cb</a></b>(3) that will be invoked as the ticket or tickets are generated.

       <b>SSL_CTX_get_num_tickets()</b> and <b>SSL_get_num_tickets()</b> return the number of tickets set by a previous call
       to <b>SSL_CTX_set_num_tickets()</b> or <b>SSL_set_num_tickets()</b>, or 2 if no such call has been made.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_CTX_set_num_tickets()</b>, <b>SSL_set_num_tickets()</b>, and <b>SSL_new_session_ticket()</b> return 1 on success or 0
       on failure.

       <b>SSL_CTX_get_num_tickets()</b> and <b>SSL_get_num_tickets()</b> return the number of tickets that have been
       previously set.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_new_session_ticket()</b> was added in OpenSSL 3.0.0.  <b>SSL_set_num_tickets()</b>, <b>SSL_get_num_tickets()</b>,
       <b>SSL_CTX_set_num_tickets()</b>, and <b>SSL_CTX_get_num_tickets()</b> were added in OpenSSL 1.1.1.
