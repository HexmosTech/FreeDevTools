</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol,  pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol — get and set the protocol attribute of the
       mutex attributes object (<b>REALTIME</b> <b>THREADS</b>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</a>&gt;

       int pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol(const pthread_mutexattr_t
           *restrict <u>attr</u>, int *restrict <u>protocol</u>);
       int pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol(pthread_mutexattr_t *<u>attr</u>,
           int <u>protocol</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</u>() and <u>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</u>()  functions,  respectively,  shall
       get  and  set the protocol attribute of a mutex attributes object pointed to by <u>attr</u> which was previously
       created by the function <u>pthread_mutexattr_init</u>().

       The <u>protocol</u> attribute defines the protocol to be followed in utilizing mutexes.  The value  of  <u>protocol</u>
       may be one of:

       PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT
       PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE
       PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT

       which   are   defined   in  the  <u>&lt;pthread.h&gt;</u>  header.  The  default  value  of  the  attribute  shall  be
       PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE.

       When a thread owns a mutex with the PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE <u>protocol</u> attribute,  its  priority  and  scheduling
       shall not be affected by its mutex ownership.

       When  a  thread is blocking higher priority threads because of owning one or more robust mutexes with the
       PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT <u>protocol</u> attribute, it shall execute at the higher of its priority or  the  priority
       of  the highest priority thread waiting on any of the robust mutexes owned by this thread and initialized
       with this protocol.

       When a thread is blocking higher priority threads because of owning one or more non-robust  mutexes  with
       the  PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT  <u>protocol</u>  attribute,  it  shall  execute  at the higher of its priority or the
       priority of the highest priority thread waiting on any of the non-robust mutexes owned by this thread and
       initialized with this protocol.

       When a thread owns one or more robust mutexes initialized  with  the  PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT  protocol,  it
       shall  execute  at  the  higher of its priority or the highest of the priority ceilings of all the robust
       mutexes owned by this thread and initialized with this attribute, regardless of whether other threads are
       blocked on any of these robust mutexes or not.

       When a thread owns one or more non-robust mutexes initialized with the PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol,  it
       shall execute at the higher of its priority or the highest of the priority ceilings of all the non-robust
       mutexes owned by this thread and initialized with this attribute, regardless of whether other threads are
       blocked on any of these non-robust mutexes or not.

       While  a  thread  is  holding  a  mutex  which  has  been  initialized  with  the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT or
       PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol attributes, it shall not be subject to being  moved  to  the  tail  of  the
       scheduling queue at its priority in the event that its original priority is changed, such as by a call to
       <u>sched_setparam</u>().   Likewise,  when  a  thread  unlocks  a  mutex  that  has  been  initialized  with the
       PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT or PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol attributes, it shall not be subject to being  moved
       to the tail of the scheduling queue at its priority in the event that its original priority is changed.

       If a thread simultaneously owns several mutexes initialized with different protocols, it shall execute at
       the highest of the priorities that it would have obtained by each of these protocols.

       When a thread makes a call to <u>pthread_mutex_lock</u>(), the mutex was initialized with the protocol attribute
       having  the  value PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT, when the calling thread is blocked because the mutex is owned by
       another thread, that owner thread shall inherit the priority level of the calling thread as  long  as  it
       continues  to own the mutex. The implementation shall update its execution priority to the maximum of its
       assigned priority and all its inherited priorities.  Furthermore, if this  owner  thread  itself  becomes
       blocked  on  another  mutex  with  the <u>protocol</u> attribute having the value PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT, the same
       priority inheritance effect shall be propagated to this other owner thread, in a recursive manner.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <u>attr</u> argument to  <u>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</u>()
       or <u>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</u>() does not refer to an initialized mutex attributes object.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful  completion,  the  <u>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</u>()  and  <u>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</u>()
       functions shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ENOTSUP</b>
              The value specified by <u>protocol</u> is an unsupported value.

       The <u>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</u>() and <u>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</u>() functions may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The value specified by <u>protocol</u> is invalid.

       <b>EPERM</b>  The caller does not have the privilege to perform the operation.

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       If   an   implementation   detects   that   the   value   specified   by    the    <u>attr</u>    argument    to
       <u>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</u>() or <u>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</u>() does not refer to an initialized mutex
       attributes object, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL]</b> error.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
