</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MPI_T_finalize -  Finalize the MPI tool information interface

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #ifdef ENABLE_QMPI
       #ifndef MPICH_MPI_FROM_PMPI
       int QMPI_T_finalize(QMPI_Context context, int tool_id) MPICH_API_PUBLIC

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This  routine  may  be called as often as the corresponding MPI_T_init_thread() routine up to the current
       point of execution. Calling it more times returns a corresponding error code. As long as  the  number  of
       calls  to  MPI_T_finalize()  is smaller than the number of calls to MPI_T_init_thread() up to the current
       point of execution, the MPI tool information interface remains initialized and calls to its routines  are
       permissible.    Further,   additional   calls   to   MPI_T_init_thread()  after  one  or  more  calls  to
       MPI_T_finalize() are permissible. Once MPI_T_finalize() is called the same number of times as the routine
       MPI_T_init_thread() up to the current point of execution, the MPI tool information interface is no longer
       initialized. The interface can be reinitialized by subsequent calls to MPI_T_init_thread().

       At the end of the program execution, unless MPI_Abort()  is  called,  an  application  must  have  called
       MPI_T_init_thread() and MPI_T_finalize() an equal number of times.

</pre><h4><b>THREAD</b> <b>AND</b> <b>INTERRUPT</b> <b>SAFETY</b></h4><pre>
       This routine is thread-safe.  This means that this routine may be safely used by multiple threads without
       the  need  for  any  user-provided thread locks.  However, the routine is not interrupt safe.  Typically,
       this is due to the use of memory allocation routines such as <u>malloc</u> or other non-MPICH  runtime  routines
       that are themselves not interrupt-safe.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       All  MPI routines (except <u>MPI_Wtime</u> and <u>MPI_Wtick</u> ) return an error value; C routines as the value of the
       function and Fortran routines in the last argument.  Before the value is returned, the current MPI  error
       handler  is called.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.  The error handler may be changed
       with   <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u>   (for   communicators),   <u>MPI_File_set_errhandler</u>   (for   files),    and
       <u>MPI_Win_set_errhandler</u>  (for  RMA windows).  The MPI-1 routine <u>MPI_Errhandler_set</u> may be used but its use
       is deprecated.  The predefined error handler <u>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</u> may be used to cause error  values  to  be
       returned.   Note that MPI does <b>not</b> guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error; however, MPI
       implementations will attempt to continue whenever possible.

       <b>MPI_SUCCESS</b>
              - No error; MPI routine completed successfully.

       <b>MPI_T_ERR_NOT_INITIALIZED</b>
              - The MPI tool information interface is not initialized.
       <b>MPI_ERR_OTHER</b>
              - Other error; use <u>MPI_Error_string</u> to get more information about this error code.
