</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SSL_pending, SSL_has_pending - check for readable bytes buffered in an SSL object

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

        int SSL_pending(const SSL *ssl);
        int SSL_has_pending(const SSL *s);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Data is received in whole blocks known as records from the peer. A whole record is processed (e.g.
       decrypted) in one go and is buffered by OpenSSL until it is read by the application via a call to
       <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read_ex.3.html">SSL_read_ex</a></b>(3) or <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read.3.html">SSL_read</a></b>(3).

       <b>SSL_pending()</b> returns the number of bytes which have been processed, buffered and are available inside
       <b>ssl</b> for immediate read.

       If the <b>SSL</b> object's <u>read_ahead</u> flag is set (see <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_read_ahead.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_read_ahead</a></b>(3)), additional protocol bytes
       (beyond the current record) may have been read containing more TLS/SSL records. This also applies to DTLS
       and pipelining (see <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_split_send_fragment.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_split_send_fragment</a></b>(3)). These additional bytes will be buffered by
       OpenSSL but will remain unprocessed until they are needed. As these bytes are still in an unprocessed
       state <b>SSL_pending()</b> will ignore them. Therefore, it is possible for no more bytes to be readable from the
       underlying BIO (because OpenSSL has already read them) and for <b>SSL_pending()</b> to return 0, even though
       readable application data bytes are available (because the data is in unprocessed buffered records).

       <b>SSL_has_pending()</b> returns 1 if <b>s</b> has buffered data (whether processed or unprocessed) and 0 otherwise.
       Note that it is possible for <b>SSL_has_pending()</b> to return 1, and then a subsequent call to <b>SSL_read_ex()</b>
       or <b>SSL_read()</b> to return no data because the unprocessed buffered data when processed yielded no
       application data (for example this can happen during renegotiation). It is also possible in this scenario
       for <b>SSL_has_pending()</b> to continue to return 1 even after an <b>SSL_read_ex()</b> or <b>SSL_read()</b> call because the
       buffered and unprocessed data is not yet processable (e.g. because OpenSSL has only received a partial
       record so far).

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_pending()</b> returns the number of buffered and processed application data bytes that are pending and
       are available for immediate read. <b>SSL_has_pending()</b> returns 1 if there is buffered record data in the SSL
       object and 0 otherwise.
