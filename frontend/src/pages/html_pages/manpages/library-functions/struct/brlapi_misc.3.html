</pre><h4><b>Function</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>int</b> <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi__pause</b> <b>(brlapi_handle_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>handle,</b> <b>int</b> <b>timeout_ms)</b>
   <b>int</b> <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi__sync</b> <b>(brlapi_handle_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>handle)</b>
   <b>int</b> <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi_pause</b> <b>(int</b> <b>timeout_ms)</b>
       Waits until an event is received from the BrlAPI server

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>timeout_ms</u> specifies an optional timeout which can be zero for polling, or -1 for infinite wait

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 on timeout, -1 on error, or on interruption by a signal or a parameter change notification, in
           which case brlapi_errno will be BRLAPI_ERROR_LIBCERR and errno will be EINTR.

   <b>int</b> <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi_sync</b> <b>(void)</b>
       Synchronize against any pending exception, and returns it. This allows to synchronously catch exception
       raised by brlapi_write calls. This works by temporarily replacing the current exception handler by its
       own handler.

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 if no exception was pending, -1 if an exception was caught.
