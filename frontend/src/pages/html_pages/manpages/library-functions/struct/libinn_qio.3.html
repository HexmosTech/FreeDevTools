       qio - Quick I/O routines for reading files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           #include &lt;inn/qio.h&gt;

           QIOSTATE *QIOopen(const char *name);

           QIOSTATE *QIOfdopen(int fd);

           void QIOclose(QIOSTATE *qp);

           char *QIOread(QIOSTATE *qp);

           int QIOfileno(QIOSTATE *qp);

           size_t QIOlength(QIOSTATE *qp);

           int QIOrewind(QIOSTATE *qp);

           off_t QIOtell(QIOSTATE *qp);

           bool QIOerror(QIOSTATE *qp);

           bool QIOtoolong(QIOSTATE *qp);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The routines described in this manual page are part of <a href="../man3/libinn.3.html">libinn</a>(3).  They are used to provide quick read
       access to files; the QIO routines use buffering adapted to the block size of the device, similar to
       stdio, but with a more convenient syntax for reading newline-terminated lines.  QIO is short for "Quick
       I/O" (a bit of a misnomer, as QIO provides read-only access to files only).

       The QIOSTATE structure returned by <b>QIOopen</b> and <b>QIOfdopen</b> is the analog to stdio's FILE structure and
       should be treated as a black box by all users of these routines.  Only the above API should be used.

       <b>QIOopen</b> opens the given file for reading with a buffer size of 32KiB.  Returns a pointer to use for
       subsequent calls, or NULL on error.  <b>QIOfdopen</b> performs the same operation except on an already-open file
       descriptor (<u>fd</u> must designate a file open for reading).

       <b>QIOclose</b> closes the open file and releases any resources used by the QIOSTATE structure.  The QIOSTATE
       pointer should not be used again after it has been passed to this function.

       <b>QIOread</b> reads the next newline-terminated line in the file and returns a pointer to it, with the trailing
       newline replaced by nul.  The returned pointer is a pointer into a buffer in the QIOSTATE object and
       therefore will remain valid until <b>QIOclose</b> is called on that object.  If EOF is reached, an error occurs,
       or if the line is longer than the buffer size (32KiB), NULL is returned instead.  To distinguish between
       the error cases, use <b>QIOerror</b> and <b>QIOtoolong</b>.

       <b>QIOfileno</b> returns the descriptor of the open file.

       <b>QIOlength</b> returns the length in bytes of the last line returned by <b>QIOread</b>.  Its return value is only
       defined after a successful call to <b>QIOread</b>.

       <b>QIOrewind</b> sets the read pointer back to the beginning of the file and reads the first block of the file
       in anticipation of future reads.  It returns 0 if successful and -1 on error.

       <b>QIOtell</b> returns the current value of the read pointer (the <a href="../man2/lseek.2.html">lseek</a>(2) offset at which the next line will
       start).

       <b>QIOerror</b> returns true if there was an error in the last call to <b>QIOread</b>, false otherwise.  <b>QIOtoolong</b>
       returns true if there was an error and the error was that the line was too long.  If <b>QIOread</b> returns
       NULL, these functions should be called to determine what happened.  If <b>QIOread</b> returned NULL and <b>QIOerror</b>
       is false, EOF was reached.  Note that if <b>QIOtoolong</b> returns true, the next call to <b>QIOread</b> will try to
       read the remainder of the line and will likely return a partial line; users of this library should in
       general treat long lines as fatal errors.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This block of code opens <u>/etc/motd</u> and reads it a line at a time, printing out each line preceded by its
       offset in the file.

           QIOSTATE *qp;
           off_t offset;
           char *p;

           qp = QIOopen("/etc/motd");
           if (qp == NULL) {
               perror("Open error");
               <a href="../man1/exit.1.html">exit</a>(1);
           }
           for (p = QIOread(qp); p != NULL; p = QIOread(qp))
               printf("%ld: %s\n", (unsigned long) QIOtell(qp), p);
           if (QIOerror(qp)) {
               perror("Read error");
               <a href="../man1/exit.1.html">exit</a>(1);
           }
           QIOclose(qp);
