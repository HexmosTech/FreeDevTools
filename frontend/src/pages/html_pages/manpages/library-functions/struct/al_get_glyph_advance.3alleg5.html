       al_get_glyph_advance - Allegro 5 API

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
              #include &lt;allegro5/allegro_font.h&gt;

              int al_get_glyph_advance(const ALLEGRO_FONT *f, int codepoint1, int codepoint2)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  function  returns by how much the x position should be advanced for left to right text drawing when
       the glyph that corresponds to codepoint1 has been drawn, and the glyph  that  corresponds  to  codepoint2
       will  be  the  next to be drawn.  This takes into consideration the horizontal advance width of the glyph
       that corresponds with codepoint1 as well as the kerning between the glyphs of codepoint1 and codepoint2.

       Kerning is the process of adjusting the spacing between glyphs in a  font,  to  obtain  a  more  visually
       pleasing  result.   Kerning  adjusts the space between two individual glyphs with an offset determined by
       the author of the font.

       If you pass ALLEGRO_NO_KERNING as codepoint1 then al_get_glyph_advance will return 0.  this can be useful
       when drawing the first character of a string in a loop.

       Pass ALLEGRO_NO_KERNING as codepoint2 to get the horizontal advance width of the glyph  that  corresponds
       to codepoint1 without taking any kerning into consideration.  This can be used, for example, when drawing
       the last character of a string in a loop.

       This  function  will  return zero if the glyph of codepoint1 is not present in the font.  If the glyph of
       codepoint2 is not present in the font, the horizontal advance width of  the  glyph  that  corresponds  to
       codepoint1 without taking any kerning into consideration is returned.

       When  drawing  a  string one glyph at the time from the left to the right with kerning, the x position of
       the glyph should be incremented by the result of <a href="../man3alleg5/al_get_glyph_advance.3alleg5.html">al_get_glyph_advance</a>(3alleg5) applied  to  the  previous
       glyph drawn and the next glyph to draw.

       Note  that the return value of this function is a recommended advance for optimal readability for left to
       right text determined by the author of the font.  However, if you like, you may want to draw  the  glyphs
       of  the font narrower or wider to each other than what <a href="../man3alleg5/al_get_glyph_advance.3alleg5.html">al_get_glyph_advance</a>(3alleg5) returns for style or
       effect.

       In the figure below is an example of what the result of al_get_glyph_advance may be like for two  glypphs
       A  and  l  of  the  same font that has kerning for the “Al” pair, without and with the ALLEGRO_NO_KERNING
       flag.
