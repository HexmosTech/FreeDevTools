       explain_putc - explain <a href="../man3/putc.3.html">putc</a>(3) errors

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;libexplain/putc.h&gt;
       const char *explain_putc(int c, FILE *fp);
       const char *explain_errno_putc(int errnum, int c, FILE *fp);
       void explain_message_putc(char *message, int message_size, int c, FILE *fp);
       void explain_message_errno_putc(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, int c, FILE *fp);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These functions may be used to obtain explanations for errors returned by the <u><a href="../man3/putc.3.html">putc</a></u>(3) system call.

   <b>explain_putc</b>
       const char *explain_putc(int c, FILE *fp);

       The  <b>explain_putc</b>  function  is  used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the <u><a href="../man3/putc.3.html">putc</a></u>(3) system
       call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it  will  do  much
       better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (putc(c, fp) == EOF)
              {
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_putc(c, fp));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>c</u>       The original c, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/putc.3.html">putc</a></u>(3) system call.

       <u>fp</u>      The original fp, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/putc.3.html">putc</a></u>(3) system call.

       Returns:
               The  message  explaining  the  error.   This message buffer is shared by all libexplain functions
               which do not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the  next  call
               to any libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b>  This  function  is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all threads, and many
       other functions in this library.

   <b>explain_errno_putc</b>
       const char *explain_errno_putc(int errnum, int c, FILE *fp);

       The <b>explain_errno_putc</b> function is used to obtain an explanation of an  error  returned  by  the  <u><a href="../man3/putc.3.html">putc</a></u>(3)
       system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errnum), but usually it will do
       much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (putc(c, fp) == EOF)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_errno_putc(err, c, fp));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>errnum</u>  The  error  value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just before this
               function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>c</u>       The original c, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/putc.3.html">putc</a></u>(3) system call.

       <u>fp</u>      The original fp, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/putc.3.html">putc</a></u>(3) system call.

       Returns:
               The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is  shared  by  all  libexplain  functions
               which  do  not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the next call
               to any libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b> This function is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all  threads,  and  many
       other functions in this library.

   <b>explain_message_putc</b>
       void explain_message_putc(char *message, int message_size, int c, FILE *fp);

       The  <b>explain_message_putc</b>  function  may  be  used  to  obtain an explanation of an error returned by the
       <u><a href="../man3/putc.3.html">putc</a></u>(3) system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually  it
       will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (putc(c, fp) == EOF)
              {
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_putc(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), c, fp);
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>message</u> The  location  in  which  to  store the returned message.  If a suitable message return buffer is
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>c</u>       The original c, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/putc.3.html">putc</a></u>(3) system call.

       <u>fp</u>      The original fp, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/putc.3.html">putc</a></u>(3) system call.

   <b>explain_message_errno_putc</b>
       void explain_message_errno_putc(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, int c, FILE *fp);

       The <b>explain_message_errno_putc</b> function may be used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by  the
       <u><a href="../man3/putc.3.html">putc</a></u>(3) system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errnum), but usually it
       will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              if (putc(c, fp) == EOF)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_errno_putc(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), err, c, fp);
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       <u>message</u> The  location  in  which  to  store the returned message.  If a suitable message return buffer is
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>errnum</u>  The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just  before  this
               function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>c</u>       The original c, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/putc.3.html">putc</a></u>(3) system call.

       <u>fp</u>      The original fp, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man3/putc.3.html">putc</a></u>(3) system call.
