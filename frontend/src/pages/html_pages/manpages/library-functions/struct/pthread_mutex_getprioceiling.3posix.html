</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pthread_mutex_getprioceiling,  pthread_mutex_setprioceiling — get and set the priority ceiling of a mutex
       (<b>REALTIME</b> <b>THREADS</b>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</a>&gt;

       int pthread_mutex_getprioceiling(const pthread_mutex_t *restrict <u>mutex</u>,
           int *restrict <u>prioceiling</u>);
       int pthread_mutex_setprioceiling(pthread_mutex_t *restrict <u>mutex</u>,
           int <u>prioceiling</u>, int *restrict <u>old_ceiling</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pthread_mutex_getprioceiling</u>() function shall return the current priority ceiling of the mutex.

       The <u>pthread_mutex_setprioceiling</u>() function shall  attempt  to  lock  the  mutex  as  if  by  a  call  to
       <u>pthread_mutex_lock</u>(),  except  that  the  process  of  locking  the mutex need not adhere to the priority
       protect protocol. On acquiring the mutex it shall change the mutex's priority ceiling  and  then  release
       the  mutex  as if by a call to <u>pthread_mutex_unlock</u>().  When the change is successful, the previous value
       of the priority ceiling shall be returned in <u>old_ceiling</u>.

       If the <u>pthread_mutex_setprioceiling</u>() function fails, the mutex priority ceiling shall not be changed.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       If successful, the  <u>pthread_mutex_getprioceiling</u>()  and  <u>pthread_mutex_setprioceiling</u>()  functions  shall
       return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The protocol attribute of <u>mutex</u> is PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE.

       <b>EPERM</b>  The  implementation  requires  appropriate privileges to perform the operation and the caller does
              not have appropriate privileges.

       The <u>pthread_mutex_setprioceiling</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> The mutex could not be acquired because the maximum number of recursive locks for <u>mutex</u>  has  been
              exceeded.

       <b>EDEADLK</b>
              The mutex type is PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK and the current thread already owns the mutex.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The  mutex  was  created with the protocol attribute having the value PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT and the
              calling  thread's  priority  is  higher  than  the  mutex's  current  priority  ceiling,  and  the
              implementation adheres to the priority protect protocol in the process of locking the mutex.

       <b>ENOTRECOVERABLE</b>
              The mutex is a robust mutex and the state protected by the mutex is not recoverable.

       <b>EOWNERDEAD</b>
              The mutex is a robust mutex and the process containing the previous owning thread terminated while
              holding the mutex lock. The mutex lock shall be acquired by the calling thread and it is up to the
              new owner to make the state consistent (see <u>pthread_mutex_lock</u>()).

       The <u>pthread_mutex_setprioceiling</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EDEADLK</b>
              A deadlock condition was detected.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The priority requested by <u>prioceiling</u> is out of range.

       <b>EOWNERDEAD</b>
              The  mutex  is  a  robust  mutex and the previous owning thread terminated while holding the mutex
              lock. The mutex lock shall be acquired by the calling thread and it is up to the new owner to make
              the state consistent (see <u>pthread_mutex_lock</u>()).

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.
