</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package provides <u>disjoint</u> <u>sets</u>. An alternative name for this kind of structure is <u>merge-find</u>.

       Normally  when  dealing with sets and their elements the question is "Is this element E contained in this
       set S?", with both E and S known.

       Here the question is "Which of several sets contains the element E?". I.e. while the  element  is  known,
       the set is not, and we wish to find it quickly. It is not quite the inverse of the original question, but
       close.   Another  operation  which is often wanted is that of quickly merging two sets into one, with the
       result still fast for finding elements. Hence the alternative term <u>merge-find</u> for this.

       Why now is this named a <u>disjoint-set</u> ?  Because another way of describing the whole situation is that  we
       have

       •      a finite <u>set</u> S, containing

       •      a number of <u>elements</u> E, split into

       •      a  set  of  <u>partitions</u>  P. The latter term applies, because the intersection of each pair P, P' of
              partitions is empty, with the union of all partitions covering the whole set.

       •      An alternative name for the <u>partitions</u> would be <u>equvalence</u> <u>classes</u>, and all elements in  the  same
              class are considered as equal.

       Here is a pictorial representation of the concepts listed above:

                +-----------------+ The outer lines are the boundaries of the set S.
                |           /     | The inner regions delineated by the skewed lines
                |  *       /   *  | are the partitions P. The *'s denote the elements
                |      *  / \     | E in the set, each in a single partition, their
                |*       /   \    | equivalence class.
                |       /  *  \   |
                |      / *   /    |
                | *   /\  * /     |
                |    /  \  /      |
                |   /    \/  *    |
                |  / *    \       |
                | /     *  \      |
                +-----------------+

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       The  package  exports  a  single  command,  <b>::struct::disjointset</b>. All functionality provided here can be
       reached through a subcommand of this command.

       <b>::struct::disjointset</b> <u>disjointsetName</u>
              Creates a  new  disjoint  set  object  with  an  associated  global  Tcl  command  whose  name  is
              <u>disjointsetName</u>.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the disjointset. It has
              the following general form:

              <u>disjointsetName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
                     The <b>option</b> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command. The following commands
                     are possible for disjointset objects:

       <u>disjointsetName</u> <b>add-element</b> <u>item</u>
              Creates a new partition in the specified disjoint set, and fills it with  the  single  item  <u>item</u>.
              The  command  maintains  the  integrity  of  the  disjoint  set, i.e. it verifies that none of the
              <u>elements</u> are already part of the disjoint set and throws an error otherwise.

              The result of this method is the empty string.

              This method runs in constant time.

       <u>disjointsetName</u> <b>add-partition</b> <u>elements</u>
              Creates a new partition in specified disjoint set, and fills it with the values found in  the  set
              of  <u>elements</u>.  The command maintains the integrity of the disjoint set, i.e. it verifies that none
              of the <u>elements</u> are already part of the disjoint set and throws an error otherwise.

              The result of the command is the empty string.

              This method runs in time proportional to the size of <u>elements</u>].

       <u>disjointsetName</u> <b>partitions</b>
              Returns the set of partitions the named disjoint set currently consists of. The form of the result
              is a list of lists; the inner lists contain the elements of the partitions.

              This method runs in time O(N*alpha(N)), where N is the number of elements in the disjoint set  and
              alpha is the inverse Ackermann function.

       <u>disjointsetName</u> <b>num-partitions</b>
              Returns the number of partitions the named disjoint set currently consists of.

              This method runs in constant time.

       <u>disjointsetName</u> <b>equal</b> <u>a</u> <u>b</u>
              Determines  if  the  two  elements  <u>a</u>  and <u>b</u> of the disjoint set belong to the same partition. The
              result of the method is a boolean value, <b>True</b> if the  two  elements  are  contained  in  the  same
              partition, and <b>False</b> otherwise.

              An error will be thrown if either <u>a</u> or <u>b</u> are not elements of the disjoint set.

              This  method  runs  in amortized time O(alpha(N)), where N is the number of elements in the larger
              partition and alpha is the inverse Ackermann function.

       <u>disjointsetName</u> <b>merge</b> <u>a</u> <u>b</u>
              Determines the partitions the elements <u>a</u> and <u>b</u> are contained in and  merges  them  into  a  single
              partition.  If the two elements were already contained in the same partition nothing will change.

              The result of the method is the empty string.

              This  method  runs  in amortized time O(alpha(N)), where N is the number of items in the larger of
              the partitions being merged. The worst case time is O(N).

       <u>disjointsetName</u> <b>find</b> <u>e</u>
              Returns a list of the members of the partition of the disjoint set which contains the element <u>e</u>.

              This method runs in O(N*alpha(N)) time, where N is the total number of items in the  disjoint  set
              and alpha is the inverse Ackermann function, See <b>find-exemplar</b> for a faster method, if all that is
              needed is a unique identifier for the partition, rather than an enumeration of all its elements.

       <u>disjointsetName</u> <b>exemplars</b>
              Returns  a  list  containing  an exemplar of each partition in the disjoint set. The exemplar is a
              member of the partition, chosen arbitrarily.

              This method runs in O(N*alpha(N)) time, where N is the total number of items in the  disjoint  set
              and alpha is the inverse Ackermann function.

       <u>disjointsetName</u> <b>find-exemplar</b> <u>e</u>
              Returns  the  exemplar  of  the partition of the disjoint set containing the element <u>e</u>.  Throws an
              error if <u>e</u> is not found in the disjoint set.  The exemplar is an arbitrarily chosen member of  the
              partition.  The only operation that will change the exemplar of any partition is <b>merge</b>.

              This  method  runs in O(alpha(N)) time, where N is the number of items in the partition containing
              E, and alpha is the inverse Ackermann function.

       <u>disjointsetName</u> <b>destroy</b>
              Destroys the disjoint set object and all associated memory.
