</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       BIO_read_ex, BIO_write_ex, BIO_read, BIO_write, BIO_gets, BIO_get_line, BIO_puts - BIO I/O functions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        #include &lt;openssl/bio.h&gt;

        int BIO_read_ex(BIO *b, void *data, size_t dlen, size_t *readbytes);
        int BIO_write_ex(BIO *b, const void *data, size_t dlen, size_t *written);

        int BIO_read(BIO *b, void *data, int dlen);
        int BIO_gets(BIO *b, char *buf, int size);
        int BIO_get_line(BIO *b, char *buf, int size);
        int BIO_write(BIO *b, const void *data, int dlen);
        int BIO_puts(BIO *b, const char *buf);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BIO_read_ex()</b> attempts to read <u>dlen</u> bytes from BIO <u>b</u> and places the data in <u>data</u>. If any bytes were
       successfully read then the number of bytes read is stored in <u>*readbytes</u>.

       <b>BIO_write_ex()</b> attempts to write <u>dlen</u> bytes from <u>data</u> to BIO <u>b</u>.  If successful then the number of bytes
       written is stored in <u>*written</u> unless <u>written</u> is NULL.

       <b>BIO_read()</b> attempts to read <u>len</u> bytes from BIO <u>b</u> and places the data in <u>buf</u>.

       <b>BIO_gets()</b> performs the BIOs "gets" operation and places the data in <u>buf</u>. Usually this operation will
       attempt to read a line of data from the BIO of maximum length <u>size-1</u>. There are exceptions to this,
       however; for example, <b>BIO_gets()</b> on a digest BIO will calculate and return the digest and other BIOs may
       not support <b>BIO_gets()</b> at all.  The returned string is always NUL-terminated and the '\n' is preserved if
       present in the input data.  On binary input there may be NUL characters within the string; in this case
       the return value (if nonnegative) may give an incorrect length.

       <b>BIO_get_line()</b> attempts to read from BIO <u>b</u> a line of data up to the next '\n' or the maximum length
       <u>size-1</u> is reached and places the data in <u>buf</u>.  The returned string is always NUL-terminated and the '\n'
       is preserved if present in the input data.  On binary input there may be NUL characters within the
       string; in this case the return value (if nonnegative) gives the actual length read.  For implementing
       this, unfortunately the data needs to be read byte-by-byte.

       <b>BIO_write()</b> attempts to write <u>len</u> bytes from <u>buf</u> to BIO <u>b</u>.

       <b>BIO_puts()</b> attempts to write a NUL-terminated string <u>buf</u> to BIO <u>b</u>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BIO_read_ex()</b> returns 1 if data was successfully read, and 0 otherwise.

       <b>BIO_write_ex()</b> returns 1 if no error was encountered writing data, 0 otherwise.  Requesting to write 0
       bytes is not considered an error.

       <b>BIO_write()</b> returns -2 if the "write" operation is not implemented by the BIO or -1 on other errors.
       Otherwise it returns the number of bytes written.  This may be 0 if the BIO <u>b</u> is NULL or <u>dlen</u> <u>&lt;=</u> <u>0</u>.

       <b>BIO_gets()</b> returns -2 if the "gets" operation is not implemented by the BIO or -1 on other errors.
       Otherwise it typically returns the amount of data read, but depending on the implementation it may return
       only the length up to the first NUL character contained in the data read.  In any case the trailing NUL
       that is added after the data read is not included in the length returned.

       All other functions return either the amount of data successfully read or written (if the return value is
       positive) or that no data was successfully read or written if the result is 0 or -1. If the return value
       is -2 then the operation is not implemented in the specific BIO type.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       A 0 or -1 return is not necessarily an indication of an error. In particular when the source/sink is
       nonblocking or of a certain type it may merely be an indication that no data is currently available and
       that the application should retry the operation later.

       One technique sometimes used with blocking sockets is to use a system call (such as <b>select()</b>, <b>poll()</b> or
       equivalent) to determine when data is available and then call <b>read()</b> to read the data. The equivalent
       with BIOs (that is call <b>select()</b> on the underlying I/O structure and then call <b>BIO_read()</b> to read the
       data) should <b>not</b> be used because a single call to <b>BIO_read()</b> can cause several reads (and writes in the
       case of SSL BIOs) on the underlying I/O structure and may block as a result. Instead <b>select()</b> (or
       equivalent) should be combined with non blocking I/O so successive reads will request a retry instead of
       blocking.

       See <b><a href="../man3/BIO_should_retry.3.html">BIO_should_retry</a></b>(3) for details of how to determine the cause of a retry and other I/O issues.

       If the "gets" method is not supported by a BIO then <b>BIO_get_line()</b> can be used.  It is also possible to
       make <b>BIO_gets()</b> usable even if the "gets" method is not supported by adding a buffering BIO
       <b><a href="../man3/BIO_f_buffer.3.html">BIO_f_buffer</a></b>(3) to the chain.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BIO_gets()</b> on 1.1.0 and older when called on <b>BIO_fd()</b> based BIO did not keep the '\n' at the end of the
       line in the buffer.

       <b>BIO_get_line()</b> was added in OpenSSL 3.0.

       <b>BIO_write_ex()</b> returns 1 if the size of the data to write is 0 and the <u>written</u> parameter of the function
       can be NULL since OpenSSL 3.0.
