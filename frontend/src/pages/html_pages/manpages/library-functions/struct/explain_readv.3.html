       explain_readv - explain <a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a>(2) errors

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;libexplain/readv.h&gt;
       const char *explain_readv(int fildes, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt);
       const char *explain_errno_readv(int errnum, int fildes, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt);
       void explain_message_readv(char *message, int message_size, int fildes, const struct iovec *iov, int
       iovcnt);
       void explain_message_errno_readv(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, int fildes, const struct
       iovec *iov, int iovcnt);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These functions may be used to obtain explanations for errors returned by the <u><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></u>(2) system call.

   <b>explain_readv</b>
       const char *explain_readv(int fildes, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt);

       The  <b>explain_readv</b>  function is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the <u><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></u>(2) system
       call. The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually  it  will  do  much
       better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       <u>fildes</u>  The original fildes, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>iov</u>     The original iov, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>iovcnt</u>  The original iovcnt, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></u>(2) system call.

       Returns:
               The message explaining the error. This message buffer is shared by all libexplain functions which
               do  not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to any
               libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b> This function is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all  threads,  and  many
       other functions in this library.

       <b>Example:</b> This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              ssize_t result = readv(fildes, iov, iovcnt);
              if (result &lt; 0)
              {
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_readv(fildes, iov, iovcnt));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_readv_or_die.3.html">explain_readv_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

   <b>explain_errno_readv</b>
       const char *explain_errno_readv(int errnum, int fildes, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt);

       The  <b>explain_errno_readv</b>  function  is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the <u><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></u>(2)
       system call. The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it  will  do
       much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       <u>errnum</u>  The  error  value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just before this
               function is called. This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to  be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <u>fildes</u>  The original fildes, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>iov</u>     The original iov, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>iovcnt</u>  The original iovcnt, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></u>(2) system call.

       Returns:
               The message explaining the error. This message buffer is shared by all libexplain functions which
               do  not supply a buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to any
               libexplain function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

       <b>Note:</b> This function is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a return buffer across all  threads,  and  many
       other functions in this library.

       <b>Example:</b> This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              ssize_t result = readv(fildes, iov, iovcnt);
              if (result &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_errno_readv(err, fildes, iov, iovcnt));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_readv_or_die.3.html">explain_readv_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

   <b>explain_message_readv</b>
       void explain_message_readv(char *message, int message_size, int fildes, const struct iovec *iov, int
       iovcnt);

       The  <b>explain_message_readv</b> function is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the <u><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></u>(2)
       system call. The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it  will  do
       much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       The <u>errno</u> global variable will be used to obtain the error value to be decoded.

       <u>message</u> The  location  in  which  to  store  the returned message. If a suitable message return buffer is
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>fildes</u>  The original fildes, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>iov</u>     The original iov, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></u>(2) system call.

       <u>iovcnt</u>  The original iovcnt, exactly as passed to the <u><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></u>(2) system call.

       <b>Example:</b> This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:
              ssize_t result = readv(fildes, iov, iovcnt);
              if (result &lt; 0)
              {
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_readv(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), fildes, iov, iovcnt);
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", message);
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

       The above code example is available pre‐packaged as the <u><a href="../man3/explain_readv_or_die.3.html">explain_readv_or_die</a></u>(3) function.

   <b>explain_message_errno_readv</b>
       void explain_message_errno_readv(char *message, int message_size, int errnum, int fildes, const struct
       iovec *iov, int iovcnt);

       The <b>explain_message_errno_readv</b> function is used to obtain an explanation of an  error  returned  by  the
       <u><a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv</a></u>(2)  system call. The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it
       will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

       <u>message</u> The location in which to store the returned message. If  a  suitable  message  return  buffer  is
               supplied, this function is thread safe.

       <u>message_size</u>
               The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

       <u>errnum</u>  The  error  value to be decoded, usually obtained from the <u>errno</u> global variable just before this
               function is called. This is necessary if you need to call <b>any</b> code between the system call to  be
               explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of <u>errno</u>.

       <b>Example:</b> This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the following example:

              if (result &lt; 0)
              {
                  int err = errno;
                  char message[3000];
                  explain_message_errno_readv(message, <a href="../manmessage/sizeof.message.html">sizeof</a>(message), err, fildes, iov, iovcnt);
