</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Module::Path - get the full path to a locally installed module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Module::Path 'module_path';

        $path = module_path('Test::More');
        if (defined($path)) {
          print "Test::More found at $path\n";
        } else {
          print "Danger Will Robinson!\n";
        }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a single function, "module_path()", which takes a module name and finds the first
       directory in your @INC path where the module is installed locally.  It returns the full path to that
       file, resolving any symlinks.  It is portable and only depends on core modules.

       It works by looking in all the directories in @INC for an appropriately named file:

       •   Foo::Bar becomes "Foo/Bar.pm", using the correct directory path separator for your operating system.

       •   Iterate  over  @INC, ignoring any references (see "require" in "perlfunc" if you're surprised to hear
           that you might find references in @INC).

       •   For each directory in @INC, append the partial path ("Foo/Bar.pm"), again using the correct directory
           path separator.  If the resulting file exists, return this path.

       •   If a directory in @INC is a symlink, then we resolve the path,  and  return  a  path  containing  the
           linked-to directory.

       •   If no file was found, return "undef".

       I  wrote this module because I couldn't find an alternative which dealt with the points listed above, and
       didn't pull in what seemed like too many dependencies to me.

       The distribution for "Module::Path" includes the "mpath" script, which lets you get the path for a module
       from the command-line:

        % mpath Module::Path

       The "module_path()" function will also cope if the module name includes ".pm"; this means you can pass  a
       partial path, such as used as the keys in %INC:

         module_path('Test/More.pm') eq $INC{'Test/More.pm'}

       The above is the basis for one of the tests.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Obviously  this  only  works  where  the  module  you're  after has its own ".pm" file. If a file defines
       multiple packages, this won't work.

       This also won't find any modules that are being loaded in some special way,  for  example  using  a  code
       reference in @INC, as described in "require" in "perlfunc".

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  a  number  of  other  modules  on  CPAN  which  provide  the  same  or similar functionality:
       App::whichpm,   Class::Inspector,   Module::Data,   Module::Filename,    Module::Finder,    Module::Info,
       Module::Locate, Module::Mapper, Module::Metadata, Module::Runtime, Module::Util, and Path::ScanINC.

       I've written a review of all such modules that I'm aware of:

           &lt;<a href="http://neilb.org/reviews/module-path.html">http://neilb.org/reviews/module-path.html</a>&gt;

       Module::Path  was  written to be fast, portable, and have a low number of core-only runtime dependencies.
       It you only want to look up the path to a module, it's a good choice.

       If you want more information, such as the module's version, what functions are provided, etc, then  start
       by looking at Module::Info, Module::Metadata, and Class::Inspector.

       The     following     scripts     can     also     give     you     the     path:     perldoc,    whichpm
       &lt;https://www.metacpan.org/module/whichpm&gt;.
