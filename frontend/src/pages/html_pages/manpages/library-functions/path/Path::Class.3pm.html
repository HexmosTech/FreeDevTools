         print $file-&gt;as_foreign('Win32');   # foo\file.txt

         # Interact with the underlying filesystem:

         # $dir_handle is an IO::Dir object
         my $dir_handle = $dir-&gt;open or die "Can't read $dir: $!";

         # $file_handle is an IO::File object
         my $file_handle = $file-&gt;open($mode) or die "Can't read $file: $!";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Path::Class" is a module for manipulation of file and directory specifications (strings describing their
       locations, like '/home/ken/foo.txt' or 'C:\Windows\Foo.txt') in a cross-platform manner.  It supports
       pretty much every platform Perl runs on, including Unix, Windows, Mac, VMS, Epoc, Cygwin, OS/2, and
       NetWare.

       The well-known module File::Spec also provides this service, but it's sort of awkward to use well, so
       people sometimes avoid it, or use it in a way that won't actually work properly on platforms
       significantly different than the ones they've tested their code on.

       In fact, "Path::Class" uses "File::Spec" internally, wrapping all the unsightly details so you can
       concentrate on your application code.  Whereas "File::Spec" provides functions for some common path
       manipulations, "Path::Class" provides an object-oriented model of the world of path specifications and
       their underlying semantics.  "File::Spec" doesn't create any objects, and its classes represent the
       different ways in which paths must be manipulated on various platforms (not a very intuitive concept).
       "Path::Class" creates objects representing files and directories, and provides methods that relate them
       to each other.  For instance, the following "File::Spec" code:

        my $absolute = File::Spec-&gt;file_name_is_absolute(
                         File::Spec-&gt;catfile( @dirs, $file )
                       );

       can be written using "Path::Class" as

        my $absolute = Path::Class::File-&gt;new( @dirs, $file )-&gt;is_absolute;

       or even as

        my $absolute = file( @dirs, $file )-&gt;is_absolute;

       Similar readability improvements should happen all over the place when using "Path::Class".

       Using "Path::Class" can help solve real problems in your code too - for instance, how many people
       actually take the "volume" (like "C:" on Windows) into account when writing "File::Spec"-using code?  I
       thought not.  But if you use "Path::Class", your file and directory objects will know what volumes they
       refer to and do the right thing.

       The guts of the "Path::Class" code live in the Path::Class::File and Path::Class::Dir modules, so please
       see those modules' documentation for more details about how to use them.

   <b>EXPORT</b>
       The following functions are exported by default.

       file
           A synonym for "Path::Class::File-&gt;new".

       dir A synonym for "Path::Class::Dir-&gt;new".

       If  you  would  like to prevent their export, you may explicitly pass an empty list to perl's "use", i.e.
       "use Path::Class ()".

       The following are exported only on demand.

       foreign_file
           A synonym for "Path::Class::File-&gt;new_foreign".

       foreign_dir
           A synonym for "Path::Class::Dir-&gt;new_foreign".

       tempdir
           Create a new Path::Class::Dir instance pointed to temporary directory.

             my $temp = Path::Class::tempdir(CLEANUP =&gt; 1);

           A synonym for "Path::Class::Dir-&gt;new(File::Temp::tempdir(@_))".

</pre><h4><b>Notes</b> <b>on</b> <b>Cross-Platform</b> <b>Compatibility</b></h4><pre>
       Although it is much easier to write cross-platform-friendly code with this module than with "File::Spec",
       there are still some issues to be aware of.

       â€¢   On some platforms, notably VMS and some older versions of DOS (I think), all filenames must  have  an
           extension.   Thus  if  you  create  a  file  called  <u>foo/bar</u>  and then ask for a list of files in the
           directory <u>foo</u>, you may find a file called <u>bar.</u> instead of the <u>bar</u> you were expecting.  Thus it  might
           be a good idea to use an extension in the first place.
