       Tcl_SplitPath, Tcl_JoinPath, Tcl_GetPathType - manipulate platform-dependent file paths

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;tcl.h&gt;</b>

       <b>Tcl_SplitPath</b>(<u>path,</u> <u>argcPtr,</u> <u>argvPtr</u>)

       char *
       <b>Tcl_JoinPath</b>(<u>argc,</u> <u>argv,</u> <u>resultPtr</u>)

       Tcl_PathType
       <b>Tcl_GetPathType</b>(<u>path</u>)

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       const char <u>*path</u> (in)                      File  path in a form appropriate for the current platform (see
                                                  the <b>filename</b>  manual  entry  for  acceptable  forms  for  path
                                                  names).

       Tcl_Size | int <u>*argcPtr</u> (out)              Filled  in  with  number  of  path  elements  in <u>path</u>.  May be
                                                  (Tcl_Size *)NULL when not used. If it  points  to  a  variable
                                                  which  type  is  not  <b>Tcl_Size</b>,  a  compiler  warning  will be
                                                  generated.  If your extensions is compiled  with  -DTCL_8_API,
                                                  argcPtr  will  be  filled  with  -1  for  paths with more than
                                                  INT_MAX elements (which should trigger proper error-handling),
                                                  otherwise expect it to crash.

       const char <u>***argvPtr</u> (out)                <u>*argvPtr</u> will be filled in with the address  of  an  array  of
                                                  pointers  to  the  strings  that are the extracted elements of
                                                  <u>path</u>.  There will be <u>*argcPtr</u>  valid  entries  in  the  array,
                                                  followed by a NULL entry.

       Tcl_Size <u>argc</u> (in)                         Number of elements in <u>argv</u>.

       const char *const <u>*argv</u> (in)               Array of path elements to merge together into a single path.

       Tcl_DString <u>*resultPtr</u> (in/out)            A pointer to an initialized <b>Tcl_DString</b> to which the result of
                                                  <b>Tcl_JoinPath</b> will be appended.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These procedures have been superseded by the Tcl-value-aware procedures in the <b>FileSystem</b> man page, which
       are more efficient.

       These  procedures  may be used to disassemble and reassemble file paths in a platform independent manner:
       they provide C-level access to the same functionality as the <b>file</b> <b>split</b>, <b>file</b>  <b>join</b>,  and  <b>file</b>  <b>pathtype</b>
       commands.

       <b>Tcl_SplitPath</b> breaks a path into its constituent elements, returning an array of pointers to the elements
       using  <u>argcPtr</u>  and  <u>argvPtr</u>.   The  area  of  memory pointed to by <u>*argvPtr</u> is dynamically allocated; in
       addition to the array of pointers, it also holds copies of all the path elements.   It  is  the  caller's
       responsibility to free all of this storage.  For example, suppose that you have called <b>Tcl_SplitPath</b> with
       the following code:

              Tcl_Size argc;
              char *path;
              char **argv;
              ...
              Tcl_SplitPath(string, &amp;argc, &amp;argv);

       Then you should eventually free the storage with a call like the following:

              Tcl_Free(argv);

       <b>Tcl_JoinPath</b>  is  the  inverse of <b>Tcl_SplitPath</b>: it takes a collection of path elements given by <u>argc</u> and
       <u>argv</u> and generates a result string that is a properly constructed path. The result string is appended  to
       <u>resultPtr</u>.  <u>ResultPtr</u> must refer to an initialized <b>Tcl_DString</b>.

       If the result of <b>Tcl_SplitPath</b> is passed to <b>Tcl_JoinPath</b>, the result will refer to the same location, but
       may  not  be  in  the same form.  This is because <b>Tcl_SplitPath</b> and <b>Tcl_JoinPath</b> eliminate duplicate path
       separators and return a normalized form for each platform.

       <b>Tcl_GetPathType</b> returns the type of the specified <u>path</u>, where <b>Tcl_PathType</b> is one  of  <b>TCL_PATH_ABSOLUTE</b>,
       <b>TCL_PATH_RELATIVE</b>,  or  <b>TCL_PATH_VOLUME_RELATIVE</b>.  See the <b>filename</b> manual entry for a description of the
       path types for each platform.
