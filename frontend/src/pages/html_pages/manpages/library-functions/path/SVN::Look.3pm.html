</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SVN::Look - Caching wrapper around the svnlook command

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.43

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use SVN::Look;
         my $revlook = SVN::Look-&gt;new('/repo/path', -r =&gt; 123);
         my $author  = $revlook-&gt;author();
         my $msg     = $revlook-&gt;log_msg();
         my @added_files   = $revlook-&gt;added();
         my @updated_files = $revlook-&gt;updated();
         my @deleted_files = $revlook-&gt;deleted();
         my @changed_files = $revlook-&gt;changed();
         my $file_contents = $revlook-&gt;cat('/path/to/file/in/repository');

         my $trxlook = SVN::Look-&gt;new('/repo/path', -t =&gt; 123);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The svnlook command is the workhorse of Subversion hook scripts, being used to gather all sorts of
       information about a repository, its revisions, and its transactions. This module provides a simple object
       oriented interface to a specific svnlook invocation, to make it easier to hook writers to get and use the
       information they need. Moreover, all the information gathered by calling the svnlook command is cached in
       the object, avoiding repetitious calls.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>REPO</b> <b>[,</b> <b>WHAT,</b> <b>NUMBER]</b>
       The SVN::Look constructor needs one or three arguments:

       REPO is the path to the repository.
       WHAT must be either '-r' or '-t', specifying if the third argument is a revision number or a transaction
       number, respectively. If neither -r or -t is specified, the HEAD revision is used.
       NUMBER is either a revision or transaction NUMBER, as specified by WHAT.

   <b>repo</b>
       Returns the repository path that was passed to the constructor.

   <b>txn</b>
       Returns the transaction number that was passed to the constructor. If none was passed, returns undef.

   <b>rev</b>
       Returns the revision number that was passed to the constructor. If none was passed, returns undef.

   <b>author</b>
       Returns the author of the revision/transaction.

   <b>cat</b> <b>PATH</b>
       Returns  the  contents  of  the  file  at  PATH. In scalar context, return the whole contents in a single
       string. In list context returns a list of chomped lines.

   <b>changed_hash</b>
       Returns a reference to a hash containing information about all file changes occurred in the revision. The
       hash always has the following keys:

       added
           A list of files added in the revision.

       deleted
           A list of files deleted in the revision.

       updated
           A list of files updated in the revision.

       prop_modified
           A list of files that had properties modified in the revision.

       copied
           A hash containing information about each file or diretory copied in the revision. The hash  keys  are
           the  names  of  elements copied to. The value associated with a key is a two-element array containing
           the name of the element copied from and the specific revision from which it was copied.

   <b>added</b>
       Returns the list of files added in the revision/transaction.

   <b>updated</b>
       Returns the list of files updated in the revision/transaction.

   <b>deleted</b>
       Returns the list of files deleted in the revision/transaction.

   <b>prop_modified</b>
       Returns the list of files that had properties modified in the revision/transaction.

   <b>changed</b>
       Returns the list of all files added, updated, deleted, and the ones that had properties modified  in  the
       revision/transaction.

   <b>copied_to</b>
       Returns the list of new names of files that were copied in the revision/transaction.

   <b>copied_from</b>
       Returns  the  list  of original names of files that were copied in the revision/transaction. The order of
       this list is guaranteed to agree with the order generated by the method copied_to.

   <b>date</b>
       Returns the date of the revision/transaction.

   <b>diff</b> <b>[OPTS,</b> <b>...]</b>
       Returns the GNU-style diffs of changed files and properties. There are three optional options that can be
       passed as strings:

       "--no-diff-deleted"
           Do not print differences for deleted files

       "--no-diff-added"
           Do not print differences for added files.

       "--diff-copy-from"
           Print differences against the copy source.

       In scalar context, return the whole diff in a single string. In list context returns a  list  of  chomped
       lines.

   <b>dirs_changed</b>
       Returns the list of directories changed in the revision/transaction.

   <b>filesize</b> <b>PATH</b>
       Returns the size (in bytes) of the file located at PATH as it is represented in the repository.

   <b>info</b>
       Returns the author, datestamp, log message size, and log message of the revision/transaction.

   <b>lock</b> <b>PATH</b>
       If PATH has a lock, returns a hash containing information about the lock, with the following keys:

       UUID Token
           A string with the opaque lock token.

       Owner
           The name of the user that has the lock.

       Created
           The  time  at  which the lock was created, in a format like this: '2010-02-16 17:23:08 -0200 (Tue, 16
           Feb 2010)'.

       Comment
           The lock comment.

       If PATH has no lock, returns undef.

   <b>log_msg</b>
       Returns the log message of the revision/transaction.

   <b>propget</b> <b>PROPNAME</b> <b>PATH</b>
       Returns the value of PROPNAME in PATH.

   <b>proplist</b> <b>PATH</b>
       Returns a reference to a hash containing the properties associated with PATH.

   <b>tree</b> <b>[PATH_IN_REPOS,</b> <b>OPTS,</b> <b>...]</b>
       Returns the repository tree as a list of paths, starting at PATH_IN_REPOS (if supplied, at  the  root  of
       the tree otherwise), optionally showing node revision ids.

       "--full-paths"
           show full paths instead of indenting them.

       "--show-ids"
           Returns the node revision ids for each path.

       "--non-recursive"
           Operate on single directory only.

   <b>uuid</b>
       Returns the repository's UUID.

   <b>youngest</b>
       Returns the repository's youngest revision number.
