</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Filename - Portable filename comparison

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.03

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Test::Filename tests =&gt; 2;

         filename_is  ( "some\path", "some/path", "should pass" );
         filename_isnt( "some\path", "some/path", "should fail" );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Many cross-platform test failures -- particularly on Win32 -- are due to hard-coded file paths being used
       in comparison tests.

         my $file = get_file();     # returns "foo\bar.t";
         is( $file, "foo/bar.t" );  # fails on Win32

       This simple module provides some handy functions to convert all those path separators automatically so
       filename tests will just DWIM.

       The alternative is to write your own utility subroutine and use it everywhere or just keep on littering
       your test code with calls to File::Spec -- yuck!

         is( $file, File::Spec-&gt;canonpath("some/path"), "should pass" );

       Since this module is so simple, you might not think it worth including as a dependency.  After all, it's
       not <u>that</u> hard to always remember to use File::Spec, Path::Tiny or some other file utility, right? But
       odds are that, at some point, you'll be so busy writing tests that you'll forget and hard-code a path in
       your haste to show what a clever programmer you are.

       So just use this module and stop worrying about it.  You'll be happier and so will anyone trying to
       install your modules on Win32.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Just like Test::More, you have the option of providing a test plan as arguments when you use this module.
       The following functions are imported by default.

   <b>filename_is</b> <b>=head2</b> <b>filename_isnt</b>
           filename_is  ( $got, $expected, $label );
           filename_isnt( $got, $expected, $label );

       These functions work just like "is()" and "isnt()" from Test::More, but the first two argument will be
       cleaned up and normalized to Unix-style paths using Path::Tiny.  This means that ".\foo.txt" will get
       normalized to "foo.txt" and so on.
