</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Path::Class::File - Objects representing files

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.37

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Path::Class;  # Exports file() by default

         my $file = file('foo', 'bar.txt');  # Path::Class::File object
         my $file = Path::Class::File-&gt;new('foo', 'bar.txt'); # Same thing

         # Stringifies to 'foo/bar.txt' on Unix, 'foo\bar.txt' on Windows, etc.
         print "file: $file\n";

         if ($file-&gt;is_absolute) { ... }
         if ($file-&gt;is_relative) { ... }

         my $v = $file-&gt;volume; # Could be 'C:' on Windows, empty string
                                # on Unix, 'Macintosh HD:' on Mac OS

         $file-&gt;cleanup; # Perform logical cleanup of pathname
         $file-&gt;resolve; # Perform physical cleanup of pathname

         my $dir = $file-&gt;dir;  # A Path::Class::Dir object

         my $abs = $file-&gt;absolute; # Transform to absolute path
         my $rel = $file-&gt;relative; # Transform to relative path

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "Path::Class::File" class contains functionality for manipulating file names in a cross-platform way.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $file = Path::Class::File-&gt;new( &lt;dir1&gt;, &lt;dir2&gt;, ..., &lt;file&gt; )
       $file = file( &lt;dir1&gt;, &lt;dir2&gt;, ..., &lt;file&gt; )
           Creates a new "Path::Class::File" object and returns it.  The arguments specify the path to the file.
           Any  volume  may  also be specified as the first argument, or as part of the first argument.  You can
           use platform-neutral syntax:

             my $file = file( 'foo', 'bar', 'baz.txt' );

           or platform-native syntax:

             my $file = file( 'foo/bar/baz.txt' );

           or a mixture of the two:

             my $file = file( 'foo/bar', 'baz.txt' );

           All three of the above examples create relative paths.  To create an absolute path,  either  use  the
           platform native syntax for doing so:

             my $file = file( '/var/tmp/foo.txt' );

           or use an empty string as the first argument:

             my $file = file( '', 'var', 'tmp', 'foo.txt' );

           If  the  second form seems awkward, that's somewhat intentional - paths like "<a href="file:/var/tmp">/var/tmp</a>" or "\Windows"
           aren't cross-platform concepts in the first place, so they probably shouldn't appear in your code  if
           you're  trying  to  be cross-platform.  The first form is perfectly fine, because paths like this may
           come from config files, user input, or whatever.

       $file-&gt;stringify
           This method is called internally when a "Path::Class::File" object is used in a  string  context,  so
           the following are equivalent:

             $string = $file-&gt;stringify;
             $string = "$file";

       $file-&gt;volume
           Returns  the  volume  (e.g.  "C:" on Windows, "Macintosh HD:" on Mac OS, etc.) of the object, if any.
           Otherwise, returns the empty string.

       $file-&gt;basename
           Returns the name of the file as a string, without the directory portion (if any).

       $file-&gt;components
           Returns a list of the directory components of this file, followed by the basename.

           Note: unlike "$dir-&gt;components", this method currently does not accept any arguments to select  which
           elements of the list will be returned.  It may do so in the future.  Currently it throws an exception
           if such arguments are present.

       $file-&gt;is_dir
           Returns  a  boolean  value  indicating whether this object represents a directory.  Not surprisingly,
           "Path::Class::File" objects always return false, and Path::Class::Dir objects always return true.

       $file-&gt;is_absolute
           Returns true or false depending on whether the file  refers  to  an  absolute  path  specifier  (like
           "/usr/local/foo.txt" or "\Windows\Foo.txt").

       $file-&gt;is_relative
           Returns  true  or  false  depending  on  whether  the  file refers to a relative path specifier (like
           "lib/foo.txt" or ".\Foo.txt").

       $file-&gt;cleanup
           Performs a logical cleanup of the file path.  For instance:

             my $file = file('/foo//baz/./foo.txt')-&gt;cleanup;
             # $file now represents '/foo/baz/foo.txt';

       $dir-&gt;resolve
           Performs a physical cleanup of the file path.  For instance:

             my $file = file('/foo/baz/../foo.txt')-&gt;resolve;
             # $file now represents '/foo/foo.txt', assuming no symlinks

           This actually consults the filesystem to verify the validity of the path.

       $dir = $file-&gt;dir
           Returns a "Path::Class::Dir" object representing the directory containing this file.

       $dir = $file-&gt;parent
           A synonym for the "dir()" method.

       $abs = $file-&gt;absolute
           Returns a "Path::Class::File" object representing $file as an absolute path.  An  optional  argument,
           given  as either a string or a Path::Class::Dir object, specifies the directory to use as the base of
           relativity - otherwise the current working directory will be used.

       $rel = $file-&gt;relative
           Returns a "Path::Class::File" object representing $file as a relative path.   An  optional  argument,
           given  as  either a string or a "Path::Class::Dir" object, specifies the directory to use as the base
           of relativity - otherwise the current working directory will be used.

       $foreign = $file-&gt;as_foreign($type)
           Returns a "Path::Class::File" object representing $file as it would be specified on a system of  type
           $type.   Known  types include "Unix", "Win32", "Mac", "VMS", and "OS2", i.e. anything for which there
           is a subclass of "File::Spec".

           Any generated objects (subdirectories, files, parents, etc.) will also retain this type.

       $foreign = Path::Class::File-&gt;new_foreign($type, @args)
           Returns a "Path::Class::File" object representing a file as it would be specified on a system of type
           $type.  Known types include "Unix", "Win32", "Mac", "VMS", and "OS2", i.e. anything for  which  there
           is a subclass of "File::Spec".

           The arguments in @args are the same as they would be specified in "new()".

       $fh = $file-&gt;open($mode, $permissions)
           Passes the given arguments, including $file, to "IO::File-&gt;new" (which in turn calls "IO::File-&gt;open"
           and  returns  the  result as an IO::File object.  If the opening fails, "undef" is returned and $! is
           set.

       $fh = $file-&gt;<b>openr()</b>
           A shortcut for

            $fh = $file-&gt;open('r') or croak "Can't read $file: $!";

       $fh = $file-&gt;<b>openw()</b>
           A shortcut for

            $fh = $file-&gt;open('w') or croak "Can't write to $file: $!";

       $fh = $file-&gt;<b>opena()</b>
           A shortcut for

            $fh = $file-&gt;open('a') or croak "Can't append to $file: $!";

       $file-&gt;touch
           Sets the modification and access time of the given file to right now, if  the  file  exists.   If  it
           doesn't  exist,  "touch()"  will  <u>make</u> it exist, and - YES! - set its modification and access time to
           now.

       $file-&gt;<b>slurp()</b>
           In a scalar context, returns the contents of $file in a string.  In a list context, returns the lines
           of $file (according to how $/ is set) as a list.  If the file can't be read, this method  will  throw
           an exception.

           If  you  want  "chomp()" run on each line of the file, pass a true value for the "chomp" or "chomped"
           parameters:

             my @lines = $file-&gt;slurp(chomp =&gt; 1);

           You may also use the "iomode" parameter to pass in an IO mode to use when opening the  file,  usually
           IO  layers  (though  anything accepted by the MODE argument of "open()" is accepted here).  Just make
           sure it's a <u>reading</u> mode.

             my @lines = $file-&gt;slurp(iomode =&gt; ':crlf');
             my $lines = $file-&gt;slurp(iomode =&gt; '&lt;:encoding(UTF-8)');

           The default "iomode" is "r".

           Lines can also be automatically split, mimicking the perl  command-line  option  "-a"  by  using  the
           "split" parameter. If this parameter is used, each line will be returned as an array ref.

               my @lines = $file-&gt;slurp( chomp =&gt; 1, split =&gt; qr/\s*,\s*/ );

           The "split" parameter can only be used in a list context.

       $file-&gt;spew( $content );
           The  opposite of "slurp", this takes a list of strings and prints them to the file in write mode.  If
           the file can't be written to, this method will throw an exception.

           The content to be written can be either an array ref or a plain scalar.  If the content is  an  array
           ref then each entry in the array will be written to the file.

           You  may  use  the  "iomode"  parameter to pass in an IO mode to use when opening the file, just like
           "slurp" supports.

             $file-&gt;spew(iomode =&gt; '&gt;:raw', $content);

           The default "iomode" is "w".

       $file-&gt;spew_lines( $content );
           Just like "spew", but, if $content is a plain scalar, appends $/ to it, or, if $content is  an  array
           ref, appends $/ to each element of the array.

           Can also take an "iomode" parameter like "spew". Again, the default "iomode" is "w".

       $file-&gt;traverse(sub { ... }, @args)
           Calls  the  given  callback  on  $file.  This  doesn't  do  much  on  its own, but see the associated
           documentation in Path::Class::Dir.

       $file-&gt;<b>remove()</b>
           This method will remove the file in a way that works well on all platforms,  and  returns  a  boolean
           value indicating whether or not the file was successfully removed.

           "remove()"  is  better  than  simply  calling  Perl's  "unlink()" function, because on some platforms
           (notably VMS) you actually may need to call "unlink()" several times before all versions of the  file
           are gone - the "remove()" method handles this process for you.

       $st = $file-&gt;<b>stat()</b>
           Invokes "File::stat::stat()" on this file and returns a File::stat object representing the result.

       $st = $file-&gt;<b>lstat()</b>
           Same  as  "stat()", but if $file is a symbolic link, "lstat()" stats the link instead of the file the
           link points to.

       $class = $file-&gt;<b>dir_class()</b>
           Returns the class which should be used to create directory objects.

           Generally overridden whenever this class is subclassed.

       $copy = $file-&gt;copy_to( $dest );
           Copies the $file to $dest. It returns a Path::Class::File object when successful, "undef" otherwise.

       $moved = $file-&gt;move_to( $dest );
           Moves the $file to $dest, and updates $file accordingly.

           It returns $file is successful, "undef" otherwise.
