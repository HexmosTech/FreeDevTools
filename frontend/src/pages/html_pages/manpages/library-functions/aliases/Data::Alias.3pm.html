       Data::Alias - Comprehensive set of aliasing operations

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Data::Alias;

           alias {
                   # aliasing instead of copying whenever possible
           };

           alias $x = $y;              # alias $x to $y
           alias @x = @y;              # alias @x to @y
           alias $x[0] = $y;           # similar for array and hash elements
           alias push @x, $y;          # push alias to $y onto @x
           $x = alias [ $y, $z ];      # construct array of aliases
           alias my ($x, $y) = @_;     # named aliases to arguments
           alias { ($x, $y) = ($y, $x) };              # swap $x and $y
           alias { my @t = @x; @x = @y; @y = @t };     # swap @x and @y

           use Data::Alias qw/ alias copy /;

           alias { copy $x = $y };     # force copying inside alias-BLOCK

           use Data::Alias qw/ deref /;

           my @refs = (\$x, \@y, \%z);
           foo(deref @refs)            # same as foo($x, @y, %z)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Aliasing is the phenomenon where two different expressions actually refer to the same thing.  Modifying
       one will modify the other, and if you take a reference to both, the two values are the same.

       Aliasing occurs in Perl for example in for-loops and sub-calls:

           for $var ($x) {
                   # here $var is an alias to $x
           }

           foo($y);
           sub foo {
                   # here $_[0] is an alias to $y
           }

       Data::Alias is a module that allows you to apply "aliasing semantics" to a section of code, causing
       aliases to be made wherever Perl would normally make copies instead.  You can use this to improve
       efficiency and readability, when compared to using references.

       The exact details of aliasing semantics are below under "DETAILS".

       Perl 5.22 added some support for aliasing to the Perl core.  It has a different syntax, and a different
       set of operations, from that supplied by this module; see "Assigning to References" in perlref.  The
       core's aliasing facilities are implemented more robustly than this module and are better supported.  If
       you can rely on having a sufficiently recent Perl version, you should prefer to use the core facility
       rather than use this module.  If you are already using this module and are now using a sufficiently
       recent Perl, you should attempt to migrate to the core facility.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
   <b>alias</b> <u><b>EXPR</b></u> <b>|</b> <b>alias</b> <u><b>BLOCK</b></u>
       Exported by default.

       Enables aliasing semantics within the expression or block.  Returns an alias to the expression, or the
       block's return value.

       "alias" is context-transparent, meaning that whichever context it is placed in (list, scalar, void), the
       expression/block is evaluated in the same context.

   <b>copy</b> <u><b>EXPR</b></u> <b>|</b> <b>copy</b> <u><b>BLOCK</b></u>
       Restores normal (copying) semantics within the expression or block, and makes a copy of the result value
       (unless in void context).

       Like "alias", "copy" is context-transparent.

   <b>deref</b> <u><b>LIST</b></u>
       Accepts a list of references to scalars, arrays, or hashes.  Applies the applicable dereferencing
       operator to each.  This means that:

           deref $scalarref, $arrayref, $hashref

       behaves like:

           $$scalarref, @$arrayref, %$hashref

       Where an array or hash reference is given, the returned list does not include the array or hash as an
       lvalue; the array/hash is expanded and the list includes its elements.  Scalars, including the elements
       of an array/hash, <u>are</u> treated as lvalues, and can be enreferenced using the "\" operator or aliased to
       using the "alias" operator.  This is slightly different from what you'd get using the built-in
       dereference operators: @$arrayref references the array as an lvalue, so "\" or "alias" can operate on the
       array itself rather than just its elements.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       A common usage of aliasing is to make an abbreviation for an expression, to avoid having to repeat that
       (possibly verbose or ugly) expression over and over:

           alias my $fi = $self-&gt;{FrobnitzIndex};
           $fi = $fi &gt; 0 ? $fi - $adj : $fi + $adj;

           sub rc4 {
                   alias my ($i, $j, $S) = @_;
                   my $a = $S-&gt;[($i += 1) &amp;= 255];
                   my $b = $S-&gt;[($j += $S-&gt;[$i]) &amp;= 255];
                   $S-&gt;[(($S-&gt;[$j] = $a) + ($S-&gt;[$i] = $b)) &amp; 255]
           }

       In the second example, the rc4 function updates its first two arguments (two state values) in addition to
       returning a value.

       Aliasing can also be used to avoid copying big strings.  This example would work fine without "alias" but
       would be much slower when passed a big string:

           sub middlesection ($) {
                   alias my $s = shift;
                   substr $s, length($s)/4, length($s)/2
           }

       You can also apply aliasing semantics to an entire block.  Here this is used to swap two arrays in <a href="../man1/O.1.html">O</a>(1)
       time:

           alias {
                   my @temp = @x;
                   @x = @y;
                   @y = @temp;
           };

       The "copy" function is typically used to temporarily reinstate normal semantics, but can also be used to
       explicitly copy a value when perl would normally not do so:

           my $ref = \copy $x;

</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes exactly what the aliasing semantics are of operations.  Anything not listed below
       has unaltered behaviour.

       scalar assignment to variable or element.
           Makes the left-side of the assignment an alias to the right-side expression, which can be anything.

               alias my $lexvar = $foo;
               alias $pkgvar = $foo;
               alias $array[$i] = $foo;
               alias $hash{$k} = $foo;

           An attempt to do alias-assignment to an element of a tied (or "magical") array or hash will result in
           a "Can't put alias into tied array/hash" error.

       scalar assignment to dereference
           If  $ref  is a reference or undef, this simply does "$ref = \$foo".  Otherwise, the indicated package
           variable (via glob or symbolic reference) is made an alias to the right-side expression.

               alias $$ref = $foo;

       scalar assignment to glob
           Works mostly the same as normal glob-assignment, however it does not set the  import-flag.   (If  you
           don't know what this means, you probably don't care)

               alias *glob = $reference;

       scalar assignment to anything else
           Not supported.

               alias substr(...) = $foo;   # ERROR!
               alias lvalsub() = $foo;     # ERROR!

       conditional scalar assignment
           Here  $var  (and $var2) are aliased to $foo if the applicable condition is satisfied.  $bool and $foo
           can be any expression.  $var and $var2 can be anything that is valid on the left-side  of  an  alias-
           assignment.

               alias $bool ? $var : $var2 = $foo;
               alias $var &amp;&amp;= $foo;
               alias $var ||= $foo;
               alias $var //= $foo; # (perl 5.9.x or later)

       whole aggregate assignment from whole aggregate
           This occurs where the expressions on both sides of the assignment operator are purely complete arrays
           or  hashes.   The  entire aggregate is aliased, not merely the contents.  This means for example that
           "\@lexarray == \@foo".

               alias my @lexarray = @foo;
               alias my %lexhash = %foo;
               alias @pkgarray = @foo;
               alias %pkghash = %foo;

           Making the left-side a dereference is also supported:

               alias @$ref = @foo;
               alias %$ref = %foo;

           and analogously to assignment to  scalar  dereference,  these  will  change  $ref  to  reference  the
           aggregate,  if $ref was undef or already a reference.  If $ref is a string or glob, the corresponding
           package variable is aliased.

           Anything more complex than a whole-aggregate expression on  either  side,  even  just  enclosing  the
           aggregate  expression  in  parentheses, will prevent the assignment qualifying for this category.  It
           will instead go into one of the following two categories.  Parenthesisation is the recommended way to
           avoid whole-aggregate aliasing where it is unwanted.  If you want to merely replace the  contents  of
           the  left-side  aggregate  with aliases to the contents of the right-side aggregate, parenthesise the
           left side.

       whole aggregate assignment from list
           If the left-side expression is purely a complete array or hash, and the right-side expression is  not
           purely a matching aggregate, then a new aggregate is implicitly constructed.  This means:

               alias my @lexfoo = (@foo);
               alias my @array = ($x, $y, $z);
               alias my %hash = (x =&gt; $x, y =&gt; $y);

           is translated to:

               alias my @lexfoo = @{ [@foo] };
               alias my @array = @{ [$x, $y, $z] };
               alias my %hash = %{ {x =&gt; $x, y =&gt; $y} };

           If  you  want to merely replace the contents of the aggregate with aliases to the contents of another
           aggregate, rather than create a new aggregate, you can force list-assignment  by  parenthesizing  the
           left side, see below.

       list assignment
           List  assignment  is  any  assignment  where  the left-side is an array-slice, hash-slice, or list in
           parentheses.  This behaves essentially like many scalar assignments in parallel.

               alias my (@array) = ($x, $y, $z);
               alias my (%hash) = (x =&gt; $x, y =&gt; $y);
               alias my ($x, $y, @rest) = @_;
               alias @x[0, 1] = @x[1, 0];

           Any scalars that appear on the left side must be valid targets for scalar assignment.  When an  array
           or hash appears on the left side, normally as the last item, its contents are replaced by the list of
           all  remaining  right-side  elements.   "undef"  can  also  appear  on  the  left  side  to  skip one
           corresponding item in the right-side list.

           Beware when putting a parenthesised list on the left side.  Just like Perl parses "print (1+2)*10" as
           "(print(1+2))*10", it would parse "alias ($x, $y) = ($y, $x)" as "(alias($x, $y)) = ($y,  $x)"  which
           does not do any aliasing, and results in the "Useless use of alias" warning, if warnings are enabled.

           To circumvent this issue, you can either one of the following:

               alias +($x, $y) = ($y, $x);
               alias { ($x, $y) = ($y, $x) };

       Anonymous aggregate constructors
           Return  a  reference  to  a new anonymous array or hash, populated with aliases.  This means that for
           example "\$hashref-&gt;{x} == \$x".

               my $arrayref = alias [$x, $y, $z];
               my $hashref = alias {x =&gt; $x, y =&gt; $y};

           Note that this also works:

               alias my $arrayref = [$x, $y, $z];
               alias my $hashref = {x =&gt; $x, y =&gt; $y};

           but this makes the lhs an alias to the temporary, and therefore read-only, reference made by "[]"  or
           "{}".   Therefore  later  attempts  to  assign  to  $arrayref  or  $hashref results in an error.  The
           anonymous aggregate that is referenced behaves the same in both cases obviously.

       Array insertions
           These work as usual, except the inserted elements are aliases.

               alias push @array, $foo;
               alias unshift @array, $foo;
               alias splice @array, 1, 2, $foo;

           An  attempt  to  do  any  of  these  on  tied  (or  "magical")  array  will  result   in   a   "Can't
           push/unshift/splice alias onto tied array" error.

       Returning an alias
           Returns  aliases  from  the current "sub" or "eval".  Normally this only happens for lvalue subs, but
           "alias return" can be used in any sub.  Lvalue subs only work for scalar return  values,  but  "alias
           return" can handle a list of return values.

           A  sub  call  will  very  often  copy  the return value(s) immediately after they have been returned.
           "alias return" can't prevent that.  To pass an alias through a sub return and  into  something  else,
           the  call  site  must process the return value using an aliasing operation, or at least a non-copying
           one.  For example, ordinary assignment with the sub call on the right hand side will copy, but if the
           call site is in the scope of an "alias" pragma then the assignment  will  instead  alias  the  return
           value.

           When  alias-returning  a  list  of  values  from  a  subroutine, each individual value in the list is
           aliased.  The list as a whole is not aliasable; it is not an array.  At the  call  site,  a  list  of
           aliases can be captured into separate variables or into an array, by an aliasing list assignment.

       Subroutines and evaluations
           Placing a subroutine or "eval STRING" inside "alias" causes it to be compiled with aliasing semantics
           entirely.   Additionally,  the  return  from  such  a sub or eval, whether explicit using "return" or
           implicitly the last statement, will be an alias rather than a copy.

               alias { sub foo { $x } };

               my $subref = alias sub { $x };

               my $xref1 = \foo;
               my $xref2 = \alias eval '$x';
               my $xref3 = \$subref-&gt;();

           Explicitly returning an alias can also  be  done  using  "alias  return"  inside  any  subroutine  or
           evaluation.

               sub foo { alias return $x; }
               my $xref = \foo;

       Localization
           Use  of  local  inside  "alias" usually behaves the same as local does in general, however there is a
           difference if the variable is tied:  in this case, Perl doesn't localise  the  variable  at  all  but
           instead  preserves  the tie by saving a copy of the current value, and restoring this value at end of
           scope.

               alias local $_ = $string;

           The aliasing semantics of "local" avoids copying by always localizing the variable itself, regardless
           of whether it is tied.

</pre><h4><b>IMPLEMENTATION</b></h4><pre>
       This module does <b>not</b> use a source filter, and is therefore safe to  use  within  eval  STRING.   Instead,
       Data::Alias  hooks  into the Perl parser, and replaces operations within the scope of "alias" by aliasing
       variants.

       For those familiar with perl's internals:  it triggers on a  ck_rv2cv  which  resolves  to  the  imported
       "alias" sub, and does a parser hack to allow the "alias BLOCK" syntax.  When the ck_entersub is triggered
       that  corresponds  to  it,  the  op is marked to be found later.  The actual work is done in a peep-hook,
       which processes the marked entersub and its children, replacing the pp_addrs with aliasing  replacements.
       The  peep  hook  will  also  take  care  of any subs defined within the lexical (but not dynamical) scope
       between the ck_rv2cv and the ck_entersub.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       Lexical variables
           When aliasing existing lexical variables, the effect is limited in scope to  the  current  subroutine
           and  any  closures  create  after  the aliasing is done, even if the variable itself has wider scope.
           While partial fixes are possible, it cannot be fixed in any reliable or consistent way, and therefore
           I'm keeping the current behaviour.

           When aliasing a lexical that was declared outside the current subroutine, a compile-time  warning  is
           generated "Aliasing of outer lexical variable has limited scope" (warnings category "closure").
