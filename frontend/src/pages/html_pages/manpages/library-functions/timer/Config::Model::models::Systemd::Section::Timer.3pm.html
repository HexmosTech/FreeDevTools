       Config::Model::models::Systemd::Section::Timer - Configuration class Systemd::Section::Timer

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration classes used by Config::Model

       A unit configuration file whose name ends in ".timer" encodes information about a timer controlled and
       supervised by systemd, for timer-based activation.

       This man page lists the configuration options specific to this unit type. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5) for the
       common options of all unit configuration files. The common configuration items are configured in the
       generic [Unit] and [Install] sections. The timer specific configuration options are configured in the
       [Timer] section.

       For each timer file, a matching unit file must exist, describing the unit to activate when the timer
       elapses. By default, a service by the same name as the timer (except for the suffix) is activated.
       Example: a timer file "foo.timer" activates a matching service "foo.service". The unit to activate may be
       controlled by "Unit" (see below).

       Note that in case the unit to activate is already active at the time the timer elapses it is not
       restarted, but simply left running. There is no concept of spawning new service instances in this case.
       Due to this, services with "RemainAfterExit=yes" set (which stay around continuously even after the
       service's main process exited) are usually not suitable for activation via repetitive timers, as they
       will only be activated once, and then stay around forever. Target units, which by default do not
       deactivate on their own, can be activated repeatedly by timers by setting "StopWhenUnneeded=yes" on them.
       This will cause a target unit to be stopped immediately after its activation, if it is not a dependency
       of another running unit.  This configuration class was generated from systemd documentation.  by

</pre><h4><b>Elements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>OnActiveSec</b>
       Defines monotonic timers relative to different starting points:

       Multiple directives may be combined of the same and of different types, in which case the timer unit will
       trigger whenever any of the specified timer expressions elapse. For example, by combining "OnBootSec" and
       "OnUnitActiveSec", it is possible to define a timer that elapses in regular intervals and activates a
       specific service each time. Moreover, both monotonic time expressions and "OnCalendar" calendar
       expressions may be combined in the same timer unit.

       The arguments to the directives are time spans configured in seconds. Example: "OnBootSec=50" means 50s
       after boot-up. The argument may also include time units. Example: "OnBootSec=5h 30min" means 5 hours and
       30 minutes after boot-up. For details about the syntax of time spans, see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7).

       If a timer configured with "OnBootSec" or "OnStartupSec" is already in the past when the timer unit is
       activated, it will immediately elapse and the configured unit is started. This is not the case for timers
       defined in the other directives.

       These are monotonic timers, independent of wall-clock time and timezones. If the computer is temporarily
       suspended, the monotonic clock generally pauses, too. Note that if "WakeSystem" is used, a different
       monotonic clock is selected that continues to advance while the system is suspended and thus can be used
       as the trigger to resume the system.

       If the empty string is assigned to any of these options, the list of timers is reset (both monotonic
       timers and "OnCalendar" timers, see below), and all prior assignments will have no effect.

       Note that timers do not necessarily expire at the precise time configured with these settings, as they
       are subject to the "AccuracySec" setting below.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>OnBootSec</b>
       Defines monotonic timers relative to different starting points:

       30 minutes after boot-up. For details about the syntax of time spans, see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7).

       If a timer configured with "OnBootSec" or "OnStartupSec" is already in the past when the timer unit is

   <b>OnStartupSec</b>
       Defines monotonic timers relative to different starting points:

       Multiple directives may be combined of the same and of different types, in which case the timer unit will
       trigger whenever any of the specified timer expressions elapse. For example, by combining "OnBootSec" and

   <b>OnUnitActiveSec</b>

       Note that timers do not necessarily expire at the precise time configured with these settings, as they
       are subject to the "AccuracySec" setting below.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>OnUnitInactiveSec</b>
       Defines monotonic timers relative to different starting points:

       Multiple directives may be combined of the same and of different types, in which case the timer unit will
       trigger whenever any of the specified timer expressions elapse. For example, by combining "OnBootSec" and
       "OnUnitActiveSec", it is possible to define a timer that elapses in regular intervals and activates a
       specific service each time. Moreover, both monotonic time expressions and "OnCalendar" calendar

       30 minutes after boot-up. For details about the syntax of time spans, see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7).

       If a timer configured with "OnBootSec" or "OnStartupSec" is already in the past when the timer unit is
       activated, it will immediately elapse and the configured unit is started. This is not the case for timers
       defined in the other directives.

       These are monotonic timers, independent of wall-clock time and timezones. If the computer is temporarily
       suspended, the monotonic clock generally pauses, too. Note that if "WakeSystem" is used, a different
       monotonic clock is selected that continues to advance while the system is suspended and thus can be used

       If the empty string is assigned to any of these options, the list of timers is reset (both monotonic
       timers and "OnCalendar" timers, see below), and all prior assignments will have no effect.

       Note that timers do not necessarily expire at the precise time configured with these settings, as they
       are subject to the "AccuracySec" setting below.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>OnCalendar</b>
       Defines realtime (i.e. wallclock) timers with calendar event expressions. See <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7) for more
       information on the syntax of calendar event expressions. Otherwise, the semantics are similar to
       "OnActiveSec" and related settings.

       Note that timers do not necessarily expire at the precise time configured with this setting, as it is
       subject to the "AccuracySec" setting below.

       May be specified more than once, in which case the timer unit will trigger whenever any of the specified
       expressions elapse. Moreover calendar timers and monotonic timers (see above) may be combined within the
       same timer unit.

       If the empty string is assigned to any of these options, the list of timers is reset (both "OnCalendar"
       timers and monotonic timers, see above), and all prior assignments will have no effect.

       Note that calendar timers might be triggered at unexpected times if the system's realtime clock is not
       set correctly. Specifically, on systems that lack a battery-buffered Realtime Clock (RTC) it might be
       wise to enable "systemd-time-wait-sync.service" to ensure the clock is adjusted to a network time source
       before the timer event is set up. Timer units with at least one "OnCalendar" expression are automatically
       ordered after "time-sync.target", which "systemd-time-wait-sync.service" is ordered before.

       When a system is temporarily put to sleep (i.e. system suspend or hibernation) the realtime clock does
       not pause. When a calendar timer elapses while the system is sleeping it will not be acted on
       immediately, but once the system is later resumed it will catch up and process all timers that triggered
       while the system was sleeping. Note that if a calendar timer elapsed more than once while the system was
       continuously sleeping the timer will only result in a single service activation. If "WakeSystem" (see
       below) is enabled a calendar time event elapsing while the system is suspended will cause the system to
       wake up (under the condition the system's hardware supports time-triggered wake-up functionality).
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>AccuracySec</b>
       Specify the accuracy the timer shall elapse with. Defaults to 1min. The timer is scheduled to elapse
       within a time window starting with the time specified in "OnCalendar", "OnActiveSec", "OnBootSec",
       "OnStartupSec", "OnUnitActiveSec" or "OnUnitInactiveSec" and ending the time configured with
       "AccuracySec" later. Within this time window, the expiry time will be placed at a host-specific,
       randomized, but stable position that is synchronized between all local timer units. This is done in order
       to optimize power consumption to suppress unnecessary CPU wake-ups. To get best accuracy, set this option
       to 1us. Note that the timer is still subject to the timer slack configured via <b><a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf</a></b>(5)'s
       "TimerSlackNSec" setting. See <b><a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</a></b>(2) for details. To optimize power consumption, make sure to set this
       value as high as possible and as low as necessary.

       Note that this setting is primarily a power saving option that allows coalescing CPU wake-ups. It should
       not be confused with "RandomizedDelaySec" (see below) which adds a random value to the time the timer
       shall elapse next and whose purpose is the opposite: to stretch elapsing of timer events over a longer
       period to reduce workload spikes. For further details and explanations and how both settings play
       together, see below.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RandomizedDelaySec</b>
       Delay the timer by a randomly selected, evenly distributed amount of time between 0 and the specified
       time value. Defaults to 0, indicating that no randomized delay shall be applied.  Each timer unit will
       determine this delay randomly before each iteration, and the delay will simply be added on top of the
       next determined elapsing time, unless modified with "FixedRandomDelay", see below.

       This setting is useful to stretch dispatching of similarly configured timer events over a certain time
       interval, to prevent them from firing all at the same time, possibly resulting in resource congestion.

       Note the relation to "AccuracySec" above: the latter allows the service manager to coalesce timer events
       within a specified time range in order to minimize wakeups, while this setting does the opposite: it
       stretches timer events over an interval, to make it unlikely that they fire simultaneously. If
       "RandomizedDelaySec" and "AccuracySec" are used in conjunction, first the randomized delay is added, and
       then the result is possibly further shifted to coalesce it with other timer events happening on the
       system. As mentioned above "AccuracySec" defaults to 1 minute and "RandomizedDelaySec" to 0, thus
       encouraging coalescing of timer events. In order to optimally stretch timer events over a certain range
       of time, set "AccuracySec=1us" and "RandomizedDelaySec" to some higher value.   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>FixedRandomDelay</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. When enabled, the randomized offset specified by "RandomizedDelaySec" is reused
       for all firings of the same timer. For a given timer unit, the offset depends on the machine ID, user
       identifier and timer name, which means that it is stable between restarts of the manager. This
       effectively creates a fixed offset for an individual timer, reducing the jitter in firings of this timer,
       while still avoiding firing at the same time as other similarly configured timers.

       This setting has no effect if "RandomizedDelaySec" is set to 0. Defaults to "false".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>DeferReactivation</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. When enabled, the timer schedules the next elapse based on the trigger unit
       entering inactivity, instead of the last trigger time.  This is most apparent in the case where the
       service unit takes longer to run than the timer interval.  With this setting enabled, the timer will
       schedule the next elapse based on when the service finishes running, and so it will have to wait until
       the next realtime elapse time to trigger.  Otherwise, the default behavior is for the timer unit to
       immediately trigger again once the service finishes running. This happens because the timer schedules the
       next elapse based on the previous trigger time, and since the interval is shorter than the service
       runtime, that elapse will be in the past, causing it to immediately trigger once done.

       This setting has no effect if a realtime timer has not been specified with "OnCalendar". Defaults to
       "false".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>OnClockChange</b>
       These options take boolean arguments. When true, the service unit will be triggered when the system clock
       ("CLOCK_REALTIME") jumps relative to the monotonic clock ("CLOCK_MONOTONIC"), or when the local system
       timezone is modified. These options can be used alone or in combination with other timer expressions (see
       above) within the same timer unit. These options default to "false".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>OnTimezoneChange</b>
       These options take boolean arguments. When true, the service unit will be triggered when the system clock
       ("CLOCK_REALTIME") jumps relative to the monotonic clock ("CLOCK_MONOTONIC"), or when the local system
       timezone is modified. These options can be used alone or in combination with other timer expressions (see
       above) within the same timer unit. These options default to "false".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Unit</b>
       The unit to activate when this timer elapses.  The argument is a unit name, whose suffix is not ".timer".
       If not specified, this value defaults to a service that has the same name as the timer unit, except for
       the suffix. (See above.) It is recommended that the unit name that is activated and the unit name of the
       timer unit are named identically, except for the suffix.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Persistent</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. If true, the time when the service unit was last triggered is stored on disk.
       When the timer is activated, the service unit is triggered immediately if it would have been triggered at
       least once during the time when the timer was inactive. Such triggering is nonetheless subject to the
       delay imposed by "RandomizedDelaySec".  This is useful to catch up on missed runs of the service when the
       system was powered down. Note that this setting only has an effect on timers configured with
       "OnCalendar". Defaults to "false".

       Use systemctl clean --what=state … on the timer unit to remove the timestamp file maintained by this
       option from disk. In particular, use this command before uninstalling a timer unit. See <b><a href="../man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl</a></b>(1) for
       details.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>WakeSystem</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. If true, an elapsing timer will cause the system to resume from suspend, should
       it be suspended and if the system supports this. Note that this option will only make sure the system
       resumes on the appropriate times, it will not take care of suspending it again after any work that is to
       be done is finished. Defaults to "false".

       Note that this functionality requires privileges and is thus generally only available in the system
       service manager.

       Note that behaviour of monotonic clock timers (as configured with "OnActiveSec", "OnBootSec",
       "OnStartupSec", "OnUnitActiveSec", "OnUnitInactiveSec", see above) is altered depending on this option.
       If false, a monotonic clock is used that is paused during system suspend ("CLOCK_MONOTONIC"), if true a
       different monotonic clock is used that continues advancing during system suspend ("CLOCK_BOOTTIME"), see
       <b><a href="../man2/clock_getres.2.html">clock_getres</a></b>(2) for details.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>RemainAfterElapse</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. If true, a timer will stay loaded, and its state remains queryable even after
       it elapsed and the associated unit (as configured with "Unit", see above) deactivated again. If false, an
       elapsed timer unit that cannot elapse anymore is unloaded once its associated unit deactivated again.
       Turning this off is particularly useful for transient timer units. Note that this setting has an effect
       when repeatedly starting a timer unit: if "RemainAfterElapse" is on, starting the timer a second time has
       no effect. However, if "RemainAfterElapse" is off and the timer unit was already unloaded, it can be
       started again, and thus the service can be triggered multiple times. Defaults to "true".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>boolean.</u>
