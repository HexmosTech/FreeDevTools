       Time::Stopwatch - Use tied scalars as timers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Time::Stopwatch;
           tie my $timer, 'Time::Stopwatch';

           do_something();
           print "Did something in $timer seconds.\n";

           my @times = map {
               $timer = 0;
               do_something_else();
               $timer;
           } 1 .. 5;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Time::Stopwatch module provides a convenient interface to timing functions through tied scalars.
       From the point of view of the user, scalars tied to the module simply increase their value by one every
       second.

       Using the module should mostly be obvious from the synopsis.  You can provide an initial value for the
       timers either by assigning to them or by passing the value as a third argument to <b>tie()</b>.

       If you have the module Time::HiRes installed, the timers created by Time::Stopwatch will automatically
       count fractional seconds.  Do <u>not</u> assume that the values of the timers are always integers.  You may test
       the constant "Time::Stopwatch::HIRES" to find out whether high resolution timing is enabled.

   <b>A</b> <b>note</b> <b>on</b> <b>timing</b> <b>short</b> <b>intervals</b>
       Time::Stopwatch is primarily designed for timing moderately long intervals (i.e. several seconds), where
       the overhead imposed by the <b>tie()</b> interface does not matter.  With Time::HiRes installed, it can
       nonetheless be used for even microsecond timing, provided that appropriate care is taken.

       •   Explicitly  initialize  the  timer  by  assignment.  The first measurement taken before resetting the
           timer will be a few microseconds longer due to the overhead of the <b>tie()</b> call.

       •   <b>Always</b> subtract the overhead of the timing code.  This is true in general even if  you're  not  using
           Time::Stopwatch.   (High-level  benchmarking tools like Benchmark.pm do this automatically.)  See the
           code example below.

       •   Take as many measurements as you can to minimize random errors.  The  Statistics::Descriptive  module
           may be useful for analyzing the data.  This advice is also true for all benchmarking.

       •   Remember  that  a benchmark measures the time take to run the benchmark.  Any generalizations to real
           applications may or may not be valid.  If you want real world data, profile the  real  code  in  real
           use.

       The  following sample code should give a relatively reasonable measurement of a the time taken by a short
       operation:

           use Time::HiRes;  # high resolution timing required
           use Time::Stopwatch;

           use Statistics::Descriptive;
           my $stat = Statistics::Descriptive::Sparse-&gt;new();

           tie my $time, 'Time::Stopwatch';  # code timer
           tie my $wait, 'Time::Stopwatch';  # loop timer

           while ($wait &lt; 60) {  # run for one minute
               my $diff = 0;
               $time = 0; do_whatever(); $diff += $time;
               $time = 0;                $diff -= $time;
               $stat-&gt;add_data($diff);
           }

           print("count: ", $stat-&gt;count(), " iterations\n",
                 "mean:  ", $stat-&gt;mean(), " seconds\n",
                 "s.d.:  ", $stat-&gt;standard_deviation(), " seconds\n");

       Note that the above code includes the time of the subroutine call in the measurement.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Since tied scalars do not (yet?) support atomic modification, use of operators like "$t++" or "$t  *=  2"
       on  timers  will  cause  them to lose the time it takes to fetch, modify and store the value.  I <u>might</u> be
       able to get around this by overloading the return value of  "FETCH",  but  I  doubt  if  it's  worth  the
       trouble.  Just don't do that.

       There  is  no  way  to  force  low-resolution timing if Time::HiRes has been installed.  I'm not sure why
       anyone would want to, since <b>int()</b> will do just fine if you want whole seconds, but still..

</pre><h4><b>CHANGE</b> <b>LOG</b></h4><pre>
       1.00 (15 Mar 2001)
           Explicitly localized $SIG{__DIE__} when testing for  Time::HiRes  availability.   Added  "A  note  on
           timing short intervals" to the POD documentation.  Bumped version to 1, no longer beta.

       0.03 (27 Feb 2001)
           Modified tests to give more information, reduced subsecond accuracy test to 1/10 seconds to allow for
           inaccurate <b>select()</b> implementations.  Tweaked synopsis and README.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Time::HiRes, "tie" in perlfunc

       For  a  higher-level  approach  to  timing,  try (among others) the modules Time::SoFar, Devel::Timer, or
       Benchmark.  Also see the profiling modules Devel::DProf, Devel::SmallProf and Devel::OpProf.
