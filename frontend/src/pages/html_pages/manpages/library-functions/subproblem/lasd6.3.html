       <b>DLASD6</b> computes the SVD of an updated upper bidiagonal matrix obtained by merging two smaller ones by
       appending a row. Used by sbdsdc.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DLASD6 computes the SVD of an updated upper bidiagonal matrix B
            obtained by merging two smaller ones by appending a row. This
            routine is used only for the problem which requires all singular
            values and optionally singular vector matrices in factored form.
            B is an N-by-M matrix with N = NL + NR + 1 and M = N + SQRE.
            A related subroutine, DLASD1, handles the case in which all singular
            values and singular vectors of the bidiagonal matrix are desired.

            DLASD6 computes the SVD as follows:

                          ( D1(in)    0    0       0 )
              B = U(in) * (   Z1**T   a   Z2**T    b ) * VT(in)
                          (   0       0   D2(in)   0 )

                = U(out) * ( D(out) 0) * VT(out)

            where Z**T = (Z1**T a Z2**T b) = u**T VT**T, and u is a vector of dimension M
            with ALPHA and BETA in the NL+1 and NL+2 th entries and zeros
            elsewhere; and the entry b is empty if SQRE = 0.

            The singular values of B can be computed using D1, D2, the first
            components of all the right singular vectors of the lower block, and
            the last components of all the right singular vectors of the upper
            block. These components are stored and updated in VF and VL,
            respectively, in DLASD6. Hence U and VT are not explicitly
            referenced.

            The singular values are stored in D. The algorithm consists of two
            stages:

                  The first stage consists of deflating the size of the problem
                  when there are multiple singular values or if there is a zero
                  in the Z vector. For each such occurrence the dimension of the
                  secular equation problem is reduced by one. This stage is
                  performed by the routine DLASD7.

                  The second stage consists of calculating the updated
                  singular values. This is done by finding the roots of the
                  secular equation via the routine DLASD4 (as called by DLASD8).
                  This routine also updates VF and VL and computes the distances
                  between the updated singular values and the old singular
                  values.

            DLASD6 is called from DLASDA.

       <b>SLASD6</b> computes the SVD of an updated upper bidiagonal matrix obtained by merging two smaller ones by
       appending a row. Used by sbdsdc.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SLASD6 computes the SVD of an updated upper bidiagonal matrix B
            obtained by merging two smaller ones by appending a row. This
            routine is used only for the problem which requires all singular
            values and optionally singular vector matrices in factored form.
            B is an N-by-M matrix with N = NL + NR + 1 and M = N + SQRE.
            A related subroutine, SLASD1, handles the case in which all singular
            values and singular vectors of the bidiagonal matrix are desired.

            SLASD6 computes the SVD as follows:

                          ( D1(in)    0    0       0 )
              B = U(in) * (   Z1**T   a   Z2**T    b ) * VT(in)
                          (   0       0   D2(in)   0 )

                = U(out) * ( D(out) 0) * VT(out)

            where Z**T = (Z1**T a Z2**T b) = u**T VT**T, and u is a vector of dimension M
            with ALPHA and BETA in the NL+1 and NL+2 th entries and zeros
            elsewhere; and the entry b is empty if SQRE = 0.

            The singular values of B can be computed using D1, D2, the first
            components of all the right singular vectors of the lower block, and
            the last components of all the right singular vectors of the upper

            respectively, in SLASD6. Hence U and VT are not explicitly
            referenced.

            The singular values are stored in D. The algorithm consists of two
            stages:

                  The first stage consists of deflating the size of the problem
