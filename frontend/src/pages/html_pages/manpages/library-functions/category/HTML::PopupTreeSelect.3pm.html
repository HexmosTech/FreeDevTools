       HTML::PopupTreeSelect - HTML popup tree widget

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use HTML::PopupTreeSelect;

         # setup your tree as a hash structure.  This one sets up a tree like:
         #
         # - Root
         #   - Top Category 1
         #      - Sub Category 1
         #      - Sub Category 2
         #   - Top Category 2

         my $data = { label    =&gt; "Root",
                      value    =&gt; 0,
                      children =&gt; [
                                   { label    =&gt; "Top Category 1",
                                     value    =&gt; 1,
                                     children =&gt; [
                                                  { label =&gt; "Sub Category 1",
                                                    value =&gt; 2
                                                  },
                                                  { label =&gt; "Sub Category 2",
                                                    value =&gt; 3
                                                  },
                                                 ],
                                   },
                                   { label  =&gt; "Top Category 2",
                                     value  =&gt; 4
                                   },
                                  ]
                     };

         # create your HTML tree select widget.  This one will call a
         # javascript function 'select_category(value)' when the user selects
         # a category.
         my $select = HTML::PopupTreeSelect-&gt;new(name         =&gt; 'category',
                                                 data         =&gt; $data,
                                                 title        =&gt; 'Select a Category',
                                                 button_label =&gt; 'Choose',
                                                 onselect     =&gt; 'select_category');

         # include it in your HTML page, for example using HTML::Template:
         $template-&gt;param(category_select =&gt; $select-&gt;output);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module creates an HTML popup tree selector.  The HTML and Javascript produced will work in Mozilla
       1+ (Netscape 6+) on all operating systems, Microsoft IE 5+ and Safari 1.0.  For an example, visit this
       page:

         <a href="http://sam.tregar.com/html-popuptreeselect/example.html">http://sam.tregar.com/html-popuptreeselect/example.html</a>

       I based the design for this widget on the xTree widget from WebFX.  You can find it here:

         <a href="http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/xtree/">http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/xtree/</a>

       This module is used to provide the category chooser in Krang, an open source content management system.
       You can find out more about Krang here:

         <a href="http://krang.sf.net">http://krang.sf.net</a>

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       To use this module you'll need to copy the contents of the images/ directory in the module distribution
       into a place where your webserver can serve them.  If that's not the same place your CGI will run from
       then you need to set the image_path parameter when you call <b>new()</b>.  See below for details.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new()</b>
       <b>new()</b>, is used to build a new HTML selector.  You call it with a description of the tree to display and
       get back an object.  Call it with following parameters:

       name
           A  unique  name for the tree selector.  You can have multiple tree selectors on a page, but they must
           have unique names.  Must be alpha-numeric and begin with a letter.

       data
           This must be a hash reference (or an array reference of these hash references, if there are  multiple
           "root" categories) containing the following keys:

           label (required)
               The textual label for this node.

           value (required)
               The  value  passed  to  the  onselect handler or set in the form_field when the user selects this
               node.

           open (optional)
               If set to 1 this node will start open (showing its children).  By default all nodes start closed.

           inactive (optional)
               If set to 1 this node will not be selectable.  It will not appear as a link  in  the  widget  and
               clicking  on  the  label  will  have  no  effect.  However, if it has children they will still be
               accessible.

           children (optional)
               The 'children' key may point to an array of  hashes  with  the  same  keys.   This  is  the  tree
               structure which will be displayed in the tree selector.

           See SYNOPSIS above for an example of a valid data structure.

       title
           The title of the window which pops up.

       button_label (optional)
           The  widget  pops  up  when  the  user  presses  a button. This field gives the label for the button.
           Defaults to "Choose".

       onselect (optional)
           Specifies a Javascript function that will be called when an item in the tree is  selected.   Recieves
           the value of the item as a single argument.  The default is for nothing to happen.

       form_field (optional)
           Specifies  a  form  field  to  recieve the value of the selected item.  This provides a no-javascript
           means to use this widget (although the widget itself, of course, uses great gobs of javascript).

       form_field_form (optional)
           Specifies the form in which to find the "form_field" specified.  If
            not included the first form on the page will be used.

       include_css (optional)
           Set this to 0 and the default CSS will not be included in the widget  output.   This  allows  you  to
           include  your own CSS which will be used by your widget.  Modifying the CSS will allow you to control
           the fonts, colors and spacing in the output widget.

           If you run the widget with include_css set to 1 then you can use that output as a base  on  which  to
           make changes.

       resizable (optional)
           Set  this  to  1  and  the  default  widget output will not be resizable.  If you run the widget with
           resizable set to 1 then default output will have a bar at the bottom which allows it to be resized by
           dragging.  Defaults to 0.

       image_path (optional)
           Set this to the URL to the images for the widget.  These files  should  be  copied  from  the  images
           directory  in  the  module distribution into a place where your webserver can reach them.  By default
           this is empty and the widget expects to find images in the current directory.

       width (optional)
           Set this to the width of the popup window.  Defaults to 200.

       height (optional)
           Set this to the height of the tree box inside the window.   This  defaults  to  0  which  allows  the
           chooser  to  grow  as  the  tree  expands.   If  you  set this option you'll probably want to set the
           "use_scrollbars" option as well.

       scrollbars (optional)
           If set to 1 the chooser will have a fixed size (specified by width and height)  and  show  scrollbars
           inside the tree area.

       hide_selects (optional)
           This  option  will  cause  the  chooser to dynamically hide select boxes on the page when the chooser
           opens.  This is necessary in order to avoid the  select  boxes  showing  through  the  chooser  under
           Windows in both IE and Mozilla (to a lesser extent).  This defaults to 1.  For a detailed explanation
           of the problem, see this page:

              <a href="http://www.webreference.com/dhtml/diner/seethru/">http://www.webreference.com/dhtml/diner/seethru/</a>

       hide_textareas (optional)
           This  option will cause the chooser to dynamically hide textareas on the page when the chooser opens.
           This is necessary to workaround a bug in Netscape 6.0 through 7.0  in  which  buttons  hovering  over
           textareas are not clickable.  This defect is fixed in version 7.1 and later.  This option defaults to
           0, since this problem only affects older browsers.

       parent_var (optional)
           This  option includes a 'parent' loop in the template data used to construct the widget's HTML.  It's
           not used by the default template, so it defaults to 0.  Set to 1 to use this  variable  in  your  own
           template via sub-classing.

</pre><h4><b>output()</b></h4><pre>
       Call <b>output()</b> to get HTML from the widget object to include in your page.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCLASSING</b></h4><pre>
       HTML::PopupTreeSelect can be subclassed, for the purposes of -- for example -- using a different template
       engine to generate the HTML.  Here's one brief example, using the Template engine:

          package My::PopupTreeSelect;
          use Template;
          use base 'HTML::PopupTreeSelect';

          sub output {
              my($self) = @_;
              return $self-&gt;SUPER::output(Template-&gt;new);
          }

          sub _output_generate {
              my($self, $template, $param) = @_;
              my $output;
              $template-&gt;process(\$MY_TEMPLATE_SRC, $param, \$output);
              return $output;
          }

       Of  course,  $MY_TEMPLATE_SRC  will  need to be provided, too.  $HTML::PopupTreeSelect::TEMPLATE_SRC is a
       global variable, so it may be modified to your liking, or your own template data can be provided to  your
       own template generator method.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       •   The  javascript  used  to  implement  the  widget needs control over the global document.onmousedown,
           document.onmousemove and document.onmouseup handlers.  This means that it's  unlikely  to  play  nice
           with other DHTML on the same page.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       Here  are  some  possible directions for future development.  Send me a patch for one of these and you're
       guaranteed a place in <u>Changes</u>.

       •   Allow each node  to  specify  its  own  icon.   Right  now  every  node  uses  "closed_node.png"  and
           "open_node.png".

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       I know of no bugs in this module.  If you find one, please file a bug report at:

         <a href="http://rt.cpan.org">http://rt.cpan.org</a>

       Alternately  you can email me directly at "<a href="mailto:sam@tregar.com">sam@tregar.com</a>".  Please include the version of the module and
       a complete test case that demonstrates the bug.
