</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MR::IProto - iproto network protocol client

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       IProto client can be created with full control of its behaviour:

           my $client = MR::IProto-&gt;new(
               cluster =&gt; MR::IProto::Cluster-&gt;new(
                   servers =&gt; [
                       MR::IProto::Cluster::Server-&gt;new(
                           host =&gt; 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx',
                           port =&gt; xxxx,
                       ),
                       ...
                   ],
               ),
           );

       Or without it:

           my $client = MR::IProto-&gt;new(
               servers =&gt; 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxx,xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxx',
           );

       Messages can be prepared and processed using objects (requires some more CPU):

           my $request = MyProject::Message::MyOperation::Request-&gt;new(
               arg1 =&gt; 1,
               arg2 =&gt; 2,
           );
           my $response = $client-&gt;send($request);
           # $response isa My::Project::Message::MyOperation::Response.
           # Of course, both message classes (request and reply) must
           # be implemented by user.

       Or without them:

           my $response = $client-&gt;send({
               msg    =&gt; x,
               data   =&gt; [...],
               pack   =&gt; 'xxx',
               unpack =&gt; sub {
                   my ($data) = @_;
                   return (...);
               },
           });

       Messages can be sent synchronously:

           my $response = $client-&gt;send($response);
           # exception is raised if error is occurred
           # besides $@ you can check $! to identify reason of error

       Or asynchronously:

           use AnyEvent;
           my $callback = sub {
               my ($reply, $error) = @_;
               # on error $error is defined and $! can be set
               return;
           };
           $client-&gt;send($request, $callback);
           # callback is called when reply is received or error is occurred

       It is recommended to disconnect all connections in child after <b>fork()</b> to prevent possible conflicts:

           my $pid = fork();
           if ($pid == 0) {
               MR::IProto-&gt;disconnect_all();
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This client is used to communicate with cluster of balanced servers using iproto network protocol.

       To use it nicely you should to implement two subclasses of MR::IProto::Message for each message type, one
       for request message and another for reply.  This classes must be named as "prefix::*::suffix", where
       <u>prefix</u> must be passed to constructor of MR::IProto as value of "prefix" attribute and <u>suffix</u> is either
       "Request" or "Response".  This classes must be loaded before first message through client object will be
       sent.

       To send messages asynchronously you should to implement event loop by self.  AnyEvent is recommended.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       prefix
           Prefix  of  the  class name in which hierarchy subclasses of MR::IProto::Message are located. Used to
           find reply message classes.

       cluster
           Instance of MR::IProto::Cluster. Contains all servers between which requests can be  balanced.   Also
           can  be  specified  in  <u>servers</u>  parameter of constructor as a list of "host:port" pairs separated by
           comma.

       max_parallel
           Max amount of simultaneous request to all servers.

       max_request_retries
           Max amount of request retries which must be sent to different servers before error is returned.

       retry_delay
           Delay between request retries.

</pre><h4><b>PUBLIC</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new( [ %args | \%args ] )
           Constructor.  See "ATTRIBUTES" and "BUILDARGS" for more information about allowed arguments.

       send( [ $message | \%args ], $callback? )
           Send $message to server and receive reply.

           If $callback is passed then request is done asynchronously and reply is passed to callback  as  first
           argument.   Method <b>must</b> be called in void context to prevent possible errors.  Only client errors can
           be raised in async mode. All  communication  errors  are  passed  to  callback  as  second  argument.
           Additional information can be extracted from $! variable.

           In  sync mode (when $callback argument is skipped) all errors are raised and $! is also set. Response
           is returned from method, so method <b>must</b> be called in scalar context.

           Request $message can be instance of MR::IProto::Message subclass.  In this case reply  will  be  also
           subclass  of MR::IProto::Message.  Or it can be passed as "\%args" hash reference with keys described
           in "_send".

       send_bulk( \@messages, $callback? )
           Send all of messages in "\@messages" and return result  (sync-mode)  or  call  callback  (async-mode)
           after all replies was received.  Result is returned as array reference, which values can be instances
           of  MR::IProto::Response  or  MR::IProto::Error  if  request  was passed as object, or hash with keys
           "data" and "error" if message was passed as "\%args".  Replies in result can  be  returned  in  order
           different then order of requests.

           See  "_send"  for more information about message data. Either $message or "\%args" allowed as content
           of "\@messages".

       disconnect_all
           Class method used to disconnect all iproto-connections. Very useful in case of <b>fork()</b>.

</pre><h4><b>PROTECTED</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       BUILDARGS( [ %args | \%args ] )
           For compatibility with previous version  of  client  and  simplicity  some  additional  arguments  to
           constructor is allowed:

           servers
               "host:port" pairs separated by comma used to create MR::IProto::Cluster::Server objects.

           timeout, tcp_nodelay, tcp_keepalive, dump_no_ints
               Are passed directly to constructor of MR::IProto::Cluster::Server.

           balance
               Is passed directly to constructor of MR::IProto::Cluster.

           See "BUILDARGS" in Mouse::Manual::Construction for more information.

       _send( [ $message | \%args ], $callback? )
           Pure asyncronious internal implementation of send.

           $message  is  an  instance  of  MR::IProto::Message.  If "\%args" hash reference is passed instead of
           $message then it can contain following keys:

           msg Message code.

           key Depending on this value balancing between servers is implemented.

           data
               Message data. Already packed or unpacked. Unpacked data must be passed  as  array  reference  and
               additional parameter <u>pack</u> must be passed.

           pack
               First argument of pack function.

           unpack
               Code reference which is used to unpack reply.

           no_reply
               Message have no reply.

           retry
               Is  retry  is  allowed.  Values  of attributes "max_request_retries" and "retry_delay" is used if
               retry is allowed.

           is_retry
               Callback used to determine if server asks for retry. Unpacked data is passed to  it  as  a  first
               argument.
