</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pthread_getconcurrency, pthread_setconcurrency — get and set the level of concurrency

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</a>&gt;

       int pthread_getconcurrency(void);
       int pthread_setconcurrency(int <u>new_level</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Unbound  threads  in  a  process  may or may not be required to be simultaneously active. By default, the
       threads implementation ensures that a sufficient number of threads are active so  that  the  process  can
       continue  to  make progress. While this conserves system resources, it may not produce the most effective
       level of concurrency.

       The <u>pthread_setconcurrency</u>() function allows an application to inform the threads implementation  of  its
       desired  concurrency level, <u>new_level</u>.  The actual level of concurrency provided by the implementation as
       a result of this function call is unspecified.

       If <u>new_level</u> is zero, it causes the implementation to maintain the concurrency level at its discretion as
       if <u>pthread_setconcurrency</u>() had never been called.

       The  <u>pthread_getconcurrency</u>()  function  shall  return  the  value  set  by  a  previous  call   to   the
       <u>pthread_setconcurrency</u>()  function.  If  the <u>pthread_setconcurrency</u>() function was not previously called,
       this function shall return zero to indicate that the implementation is maintaining the concurrency level.

       A call to <u>pthread_setconcurrency</u>() shall inform the implementation of its desired concurrency level.  The
       implementation shall use this as a hint, not a requirement.

       If an implementation does not support multiplexing of user threads on  top  of  several  kernel-scheduled
       entities,  the  <u>pthread_setconcurrency</u>()  and  <u>pthread_getconcurrency</u>() functions are provided for source
       code compatibility but they shall have no effect when called. To maintain  the  function  semantics,  the
       <u>new_level</u>  parameter  is  saved  when  <u>pthread_setconcurrency</u>()  is  called  so that a subsequent call to
       <u>pthread_getconcurrency</u>() shall return the same value.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       If successful, the <u>pthread_setconcurrency</u>() function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number  shall
       be returned to indicate the error.

       The <u>pthread_getconcurrency</u>() function shall always return the concurrency level set by a previous call to
       <u>pthread_setconcurrency</u>().    If   the   <u>pthread_setconcurrency</u>()   function   has   never   been  called,
       <u>pthread_getconcurrency</u>() shall return zero.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pthread_setconcurrency</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The value specified by <u>new_level</u> is negative.

       <b>EAGAIN</b> The value specified by <u>new_level</u> would cause a system resource to be exceeded.

       The <u>pthread_setconcurrency</u>() function shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Application  developers  should  note  that  an  implementation  can   always   ignore   any   calls   to
       <u>pthread_setconcurrency</u>()  and return a constant for <u>pthread_getconcurrency</u>().  For this reason, it is not
       recommended that portable applications use this function.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These functions may be removed in a future version.
