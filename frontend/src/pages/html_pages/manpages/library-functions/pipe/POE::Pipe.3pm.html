</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Pipe - Deprecated and replaced with delegates to IO::Pipely.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       See IO::Pipely.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       On June 29, 2012, POE::Pipe and its subclasses, POE::Pipe::OneWay and POE::Pipe::TwoWay were released to
       CPAN as IO::Pipely.  The POE::Pipe family of modules remained unchanged in POE's distribution.

       On August 18, 2013, POE::Pipe and its subclasses were gutted.  Their implementations were replaced with
       delegates to IO::Pipely.  All tests pass, although the delegates add slight overhead.  The documentation
       was replaced by this deprecation schedule.

       A mandatory deprecation warning is scheduled to be released after September 2014.  POE will begin using
       IO::Pipely directly.  This documentation will be updated to schedule the next deprecation step.

       The mandatory warning will become a mandatory error a year or so later.  Ideally this will occur in
       August 2015, but it may be delayed due to POE's release schedule.  This documentation will be updated to
       schedule the final deprecation step.

       Finally, in August 2016 or later, POE::Pipe and its subclasses will be removed from POE's distribution
       altogether.  Users will have had at least four years to update their code.  That seems fair.
