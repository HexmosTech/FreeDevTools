       dispatch_api — Designing API using dispatch

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  is  a  brief summary of some of the common design patterns to consider when designing and
       implementing API in terms of dispatch queues and blocks.

       A general recommendation is to allow both a callback block and target dispatch  queue  to  be  specified.
       This gives the application the greatest flexibility in handling asynchronous events.

       It's  also  recommended  that interfaces take only a single block as the last parameter. This is both for
       consistency across projects, as well as the visual aesthetics  of  multiline  blocks  that  are  declared
       inline.  The  dispatch  queue  to  which the block will be submitted should immediately precede the block
       argument (second-to-last argument). For example:

             read_async(file, callback_queue, ^{
                     printf("received callback.\n");
             });

       When function pointer alternatives to interfaces that take blocks are provided, the argument order of the
       function signature should be identical to the block variant; with the exception that the  block  argument
       is replaced with a context pointer, and a new last parameter is added, which is the function to call.

       The  function  based  callback  should pass the context pointer as the first argument, and the subsequent
       arguments should be identical to the block based variant (albeit offset by one in order).

       It is also important to use consistent naming. The dispatch API, for example, uses the  suffix  "_f"  for
       function based variants.
