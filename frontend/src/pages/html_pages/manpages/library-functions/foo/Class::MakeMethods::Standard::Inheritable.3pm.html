       Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Inheritable - Overridable data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package MyClass;

         use Class::MakeMethods( 'Standard::Inheritable:scalar' =&gt; 'foo' );
         # We now have an accessor method for an "inheritable" scalar value

         MyClass-&gt;foo( 'Foozle' );   # Set a class-wide value
         print MyClass-&gt;foo();       # Retrieve class-wide value

         my $obj = MyClass-&gt;new(...);
         print $obj-&gt;foo();          # All instances "inherit" that value...

         $obj-&gt;foo( 'Foible' );      # until you set a value for an instance.
         print $obj-&gt;foo();          # This now finds object-specific value.
         ...

         package MySubClass;
         @ISA = 'MyClass';

         print MySubClass-&gt;foo();    # Initially same as superclass,
         MySubClass-&gt;foo('Foobar');  # but overridable per subclass,
         print $subclass_obj-&gt;foo(); # and shared by its instances
         $subclass_obj-&gt;foo('Fosil');# until you override them...
         ...

         # Similar behaviour for hashes and arrays is currently incomplete
         package MyClass;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Inheritable (
           array =&gt; 'my_list',
           hash =&gt; 'my_index',
         );

         MyClass-&gt;my_list(0 =&gt; 'Foozle', 1 =&gt; 'Bang!');
         print MyClass-&gt;<a href="../man1/my_list.1.html">my_list</a>(1);

         MyClass-&gt;my_index('broccoli' =&gt; 'Blah!', 'foo' =&gt; 'Fiddle');
         print MyClass-&gt;my_index('foo');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The MakeMethods subclass provides accessor methods that search an inheritance tree to find a value. This
       allows you to set a shared or default value for a given class, optionally override it in a subclass, and
       then optionally override it on a per-instance basis.

       Note that all MakeMethods methods are inheritable, in the sense that they work as expected for
       subclasses. These methods are different in that the <u>data</u> accessed by each method can be inherited or
       overridden in each subclass or instance. See Class::MakeMethods::Utility::Inheritable for more about this
       type of "inheritable" or overridable" data.

   <b>Calling</b> <b>Conventions</b>
       When you "use" this package, the method names you provide as arguments cause subroutines to be generated
       and installed in your module.

       See "Calling Conventions" in Class::MakeMethods::Standard for more information.

   <b>Declaration</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       To declare methods, pass in pairs of a method-type name followed by one or more method names.

       Valid method-type names for this package are listed in "METHOD GENERATOR TYPES".

       See "Declaration Syntax" in Class::MakeMethods::Standard and "Parameter Syntax" in
       Class::MakeMethods::Standard for more information.

</pre><h4><b>METHOD</b> <b>GENERATOR</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>scalar</b> <b>-</b> <b>Class-specific</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   May be called as a class or instance method, on the declaring class or any subclass.

       •   If called without any arguments returns the current value for the callee. If the callee has not had a
           value  defined  for  this  method,  searches up from instance to class, and from class to superclass,
           until a callee with a value is located.

       •   If called with an argument, stores that as the value associated with the callee, whether instance  or
           class, and returns it,

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyClass;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Inheritable (
           scalar =&gt; 'foo',
         );
         ...

         # Store value
         MyClass-&gt;foo('Foozle');

         # Retrieve value
         print MyClass-&gt;foo;

   <b>array</b> <b>-</b> <b>Class-specific</b> <b>Ref</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   May  be  called  as  a  class  method, or on any instance or subclass, Must be called on a hash-based
           instance.

       •   The class value will be a reference to an array (or undef).

       •   If called without any arguments, returns the contents of the array  in  list  context,  or  an  array
           reference in scalar context (or undef).

       •   If  called  with a single array ref argument, sets the contents of the array to match the contents of
           the provided one.

       •   If called with a single numeric argument, uses that  argument  as  an  index  to  retrieve  from  the
           referenced array, and returns that value (or undef).

       •   If  called  with a two arguments, the first undefined and the second an array ref argument, uses that
           array's contents as a list of indexes to return a slice of the referenced array.

       •   If called with a list of argument pairs, each with a non-ref index and an  associated  value,  stores
           the  value at the given index in the referenced array. If the class value was previously undefined, a
           new array is autovivified. The current  value  in  each  position  will  be  overwritten,  and  later
           arguments with the same index will override earlier ones. Returns the current array-ref value.

       •   If called with a list of argument pairs, each with the first item being a reference to an array of up
           to two numbers, loops over each pair and uses those numbers to splice the value array.

           The  first  controlling number is the position at which the splice will begin. Zero will start before
           the first item in the list. Negative numbers count backwards from the end of the array.

           The second number is the number of items to be removed from the list. If it is omitted, or undefined,
           or zero, no items are removed. If it is a positive integer, that many items will be returned.

           If both numbers are omitted, or are both undefined, they  default  to  containing  the  entire  value
           array.

           If the second argument is undef, no values will be inserted; if it is a non-reference value, that one
           value will be inserted; if it is an array-ref, its values will be copied.

           The method returns the items that removed from the array, if any.

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyClass;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Inheritable (
           array =&gt; 'bar',
         );
         ...

         # Clear and set contents of list
         print MyClass-&gt;bar([ 'Spume', 'Frost' ] );

         # Set values by position
         MyClass-&gt;bar(0 =&gt; 'Foozle', 1 =&gt; 'Bang!');

         # Positions may be overwritten, and in any order
         MyClass-&gt;bar(2 =&gt; 'And Mash', 1 =&gt; 'Blah!');

         # Retrieve value by position
         print MyClass-&gt;<a href="../man1/bar.1.html">bar</a>(1);

         # Direct access to referenced array
         print scalar @{ MyClass-&gt;bar() };

       There are also calling conventions for slice and splice operations:

         # Retrieve slice of values by position
         print join(', ', MyClass-&gt;bar( undef, [0, 2] ) );

         # Insert an item at position in the array
         MyClass-&gt;bar([3], 'Potatoes' );

         # Remove 1 item from position 3 in the array
         MyClass-&gt;bar([3, 1], undef );

         # Set a new value at position 2, and return the old value
         print MyClass-&gt;bar([2, 1], 'Froth' );

   <b>hash</b> <b>-</b> <b>Class-specific</b> <b>Ref</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   May  be  called  as  a  class  method, or on any instance or subclass, Must be called on a hash-based
           instance.

       •   The class value will be a reference to a hash (or undef).

       •   If called without any arguments, returns the contents  of  the  hash  in  list  context,  or  a  hash
           reference  in  scalar context. If the callee has not had a value defined for this method, searches up
           from instance to class, and from class to superclass, until a callee with a value is located.

       •   If called with one non-ref argument, uses that argument as an index to retrieve from  the  referenced
           hash,  and  returns that value (or undef). If the callee has not had a value defined for this method,
           searches up from instance to class, and from class to superclass, until a  callee  with  a  value  is
           located.

       •   If  called  with  one  array-ref argument, uses the contents of that array to retrieve a slice of the
           referenced hash. If the callee has not had a value defined for this method, searches up from instance
           to class, and from class to superclass, until a callee with a value is located.

       •   If called with one hash-ref argument, sets  the  contents  of  the  referenced  hash  to  match  that
           provided.

       •   If called with a list of key-value pairs, stores the value under the given key in the hash associated
           with  the  callee,  whether instance or class. If the callee did not previously have a hash-ref value
           associated with it, searches up instance to class, and from class to superclass, until a callee  with
           a  value is located, and copies that hash before making the assignments. The current value under each
           key will be overwritten, and later arguments with the same key will override  earlier  ones.  Returns
           the contents of the hash in list context, or a hash reference in scalar context.

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyClass;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Inheritable (
           hash =&gt; 'baz',
         );
         ...

         # Set values by key
         MyClass-&gt;baz('foo' =&gt; 'Foozle', 'bar' =&gt; 'Bang!');

         # Values may be overwritten, and in any order
         MyClass-&gt;baz('broccoli' =&gt; 'Blah!', 'foo' =&gt; 'Fiddle');

         # Retrieve value by key
         print MyClass-&gt;baz('foo');

         # Retrieve slice of values by position
         print join(', ', MyClass-&gt;baz( ['foo', 'bar'] ) );

         # Direct access to referenced hash
         print keys %{ MyClass-&gt;baz() };

         # Reset the hash contents to empty
         @{ MyClass-&gt;baz() } = ();

           instance.

       •   The class value will be a reference to an object (or undef).

       •   If called without any arguments returns the current value for the callee. If the callee has not had a
