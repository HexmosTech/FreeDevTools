</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::SubCalls - Track the number of times subs are called

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.10

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Test::SubCalls;

         # Start tracking calls to a named sub
         sub_track( 'Foo::foo' );

         # Run some test code
         ...

         # Test that some sub deep in the codebase was called
         # a specific number of times.
         sub_calls( 'Foo::foo', 5 );
         sub_calls( 'Foo::foo', 5, 'Use a custom test message' );

         # Reset the counts for one or all subs
         sub_reset( 'Foo::foo' );
         sub_reset_all();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       There are a number of different situations (like testing caching code) where you want to want to do a
       number of tests, and then verify that some underlying subroutine deep within the code was called a
       specific number of times.

       This module provides a number of functions for doing testing in this way in association with your normal
       Test::More (or similar) test scripts.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In the nature of test modules, all functions are exported by default.

   <b>sub_track</b> <b>$subname</b>
       The "sub_track" function creates a new call tracker for a named function.

       The sub to track must be provided by name, references to the function itself are insufficient.

       Returns true if added, or dies on error.

   <b>sub_calls</b> <b>$subname,</b> <b>$expected_calls</b> <b>[,</b> <b>$message</b> <b>]</b>
       The "sub_calls" function is the primary (and only) testing function provided by "Test::SubCalls". A
       single call will represent one test in your plan.

       It takes the subroutine name as originally provided to "sub_track", the expected number of times the
       subroutine should have been called, and an optional test message.

       If no message is provided, a default message will be provided for you.

       Test is ok if the number of times the sub has been called matches the expected number, or not ok if not.

   <b>sub_reset</b> <b>$subname</b>
       To prevent repeat users from having to take before and after counts when they start testing from after
       zero, the "sub_reset" function has been provided to reset a sub call counter to zero.

       Returns true or dies if the sub name is invalid or not currently tracked.

   <b>sub_reset_all</b>
       Provided mainly as a convenience, the "sub_reset_all" function will reset all the counters currently
       defined.

       Returns true.
