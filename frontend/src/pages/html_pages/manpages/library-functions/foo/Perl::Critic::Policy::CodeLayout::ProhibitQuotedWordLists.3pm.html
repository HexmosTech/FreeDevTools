</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::CodeLayout::ProhibitQuotedWordLists - Write "qw(foo bar baz)" instead of "('foo',
       'bar', 'baz')".

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is part of the core Perl::Critic distribution.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Conway doesn't mention this, but I think qw() is an underused feature of Perl.  Whenever you need to
       declare a list of one-word literals, the qw() operator is wonderfully concise, and makes it easy to add
       to the list in the future.

           @list = ('foo', 'bar', 'baz');  #not ok
           @list = qw(foo bar baz);        #ok

           use Foo ('foo', 'bar', 'baz');  #not ok
           use Foo qw(foo bar baz);        #ok

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy can be configured to only pay attention to word lists with at least a particular number of
       elements.  By default, this value is 2, which means that lists containing zero or one elements are
       ignored.  The minimum list size to be looked at can be specified by giving a value for "min_elements" in
       <u>.perlcriticrc</u> like this:

           [CodeLayout::ProhibitQuotedWordLists]
           min_elements = 4

       This would cause this policy to only complain about lists containing four or more words.

       By default, this policy won't complain if any of the values in the list contain non-word characters.  If
       you want it to, set the "strict" option to a true value.

           [CodeLayout::ProhibitQuotedWordLists]
           strict = 1

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       In the PPI parlance, a "list" is almost anything with parentheses.  I've tried to make this Policy smart
       by targeting only "lists" that could be sensibly expressed with qw().  However, there may be some edge
       cases that I haven't covered.  If you find one, send me a note.

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTANT</b> <b>CHANGES</b></h4><pre>
       This policy was formerly called "RequireQuotedWords" which seemed a little counter-intuitive.  If you get
       lots of "Cannot load policy module" errors, then you probably need to change "RequireQuotedWords" to
       "ProhibitQuotedWordLists" in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.
