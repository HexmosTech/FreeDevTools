</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitBarewordDoubleColon - don't use Foo:: style barewords

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy is part of the "Perl::Critic::Pulp" add-on.  It asks you not to use the double-colon bareword
       like

           $class = Foo::Bar::;     # bad

       but instead a plain string

           $class = 'Foo::Bar';     # ok

       This is intended as a building block for a restricted coding style, or a matter of personal preference if
       you think the "::" is a bit obscure and that it's clearer to write a string when you mean a string.  On
       that basis the policy is lowest severity and under the "cosmetic" theme (see "POLICY THEMES" in
       Perl::Critic).

   <b>Indirect</b> <b>Object</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       By default a double-colon is allowed in the indirect object syntax (see "Indirect Object Syntax" in
       perlobj).

           my $obj = new Foo::Bar:: $arg1,$arg2;   # ok

       This is because "::" there is important to disambiguate a class name "Foo::Bar" from a function
       "Foo::Bar()", ie. function "Bar()" in package "Foo".

       Whether you actually want indirect object syntax is a matter for other policies, like
       "ProhibitIndirectSyntax".  If you don't want the double-colon bareword then change to arrow style
       "Foo::Bar-&gt;new($arg,...)".

   <b>Double-Colon</b> <b>Advantages</b>
       The "::" bareword is for use on package names, not general bareword quoting.  If there's no such package
       at compile time a warning is given (see "Bareword "%s" refers to nonexistent package" in perldiag)

           my $class = No::Such::Package::;  # Perl warning

       This warning can help pick up typos, though it relies on relevant packages being loaded at compile-time
       (ie. "BEGIN").  If the package is loaded by a "require" at runtime then the warning fires even though the
       code runs correctly.  For reference, a warning isn't given for the indirect object syntax, which rather
       limits its benefit.

   <b>Disabling</b>
       If you don't care about this you can always disable "ProhibitBarewordDoubleColon" from your <u>.perlcriticrc</u>
       in the usual way (see "CONFIGURATION" in Perl::Critic),

           [-ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitBarewordDoubleColon]

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       "allow_indirect_syntax" (boolean, default true)
           If  true  then allow double-colon in the indirect object syntax as shown above.  If false then report
           double-colons everywhere as violations

               # bad under allow_indirect_syntax=false
               my $obj = new Foo::Bar:: $arg1,$arg2;

           This can be controlled from your <u><a href="file:~/.perlcriticrc">~/.perlcriticrc</a></u> in the usual way.  For example

               [ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitBarewordDoubleColon]
               allow_indirect_syntax=no
