</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::MixinFactory - Class Factory with Selection of Mixins

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package MyClass;
         use Class::MixinFactory -hasafactory;
         sub new { ... }
         sub foo { return "Foo Bar" }

         package MyClass::Logging;
         sub foo { warn "Calling foo"; (shift)-&gt;NEXT('foo', @_) }

         package MyClass::UpperCase;
         sub foo { uc( (shift)-&gt;NEXT('foo', @_) ) }

         package main;

         my $class = MyClass-&gt;class( 'Logging', 'UpperCase' );
         print $class-&gt;new()-&gt;foo();
         # Calls MyClass::Logging::foo, MyClass::UpperCase::foo, MyClass::foo

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This distribution facilitates the run-time generation of classes which inherit from a base class and some
       optional selection of mixin classes.

       A factory is provided to generate the mixed classes with multiple inheritance.  A NEXT method allows
       method redispatch up the inheritance chain.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The Class::MixinFactory package is just a facade that loads the necessary classes and provides a few
       import options for compile-time convenience.

   <b>Factory</b> <b>Interface</b>
       To generate an object with some combination of mixins, you first pass the names of the mixin classes to a
       class factory which will generate a mixed class. (Or return the name of the already generated class, if
       there has been a previous request with the same combination of mixins.)

       You can add a factory method to your base class, create a separate factory object, or inherit to produce
       a factory class.

       Factory Method
           To  add a factory method to a base class, inherit from the Class::MixinFactory::HasAFactory class, or
           use the "-hasafactory" import option:

             package MyClass;
             use Class::MixinFactory -hasafactory;

             package main;
             my $class = MyClass-&gt;class( 'Logging', 'UpperCase' );
             print $class-&gt;new()-&gt;foo();

       Factory Class
           To create a new class which will  act  as  a  factory  for  another  base  class,  inherit  from  the
           Class::MixinFactory::Factory class, or use the "-isafactory" import option:

             package MyClass::Factory;
             use Class::MixinFactory -isafactory;
             MyClass::Factory-&gt;base_class( "MyClass" );

             package main;
             my $class = MyClass::Factory-&gt;class( 'Logging', 'UpperCase' );
             print $class-&gt;new()-&gt;foo();

       Factory Object
           To  create  an  object which will act as a factory, create a Class::MixinFactory::Factory instance by
           calling the <b>new()</b> method:

             use Class::MixinFactory;
             my $factory = Class::MixinFactory-&gt;new();
             $factory-&gt;base_class( "MyClass" );

             my $class = $factory-&gt;class( 'Logging', 'UpperCase' );
             print $class-&gt;new()-&gt;foo();

   <b>Inheriting</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mixed</b> <b>Class</b>
       Inheriting with a Factory Method or Factory Object
           A subclass can inherit from a mixed class:

             package MyClass::CustomWidget;
             @ISA = MyClass-&gt;class( 'Logging', 'UpperCase' );
             sub foo { local $_ = (shift)-&gt;NEXT('foo', @_); tr[a-z][z-a]; $_ }

             package main;
             print MyClass::CustomWidget-&gt;new()-&gt;foo();

       Inheriting with a Factory Class
           A subclass can use a factory class to define its own inheritance:

             package MyClass::CustomWidget;
             use Class::MixinFactory -isasubclass,
                   MyClass::Factory =&gt; 'Logging', 'UpperCase';
             sub foo { local $_ = (shift)-&gt;NEXT('foo', @_); tr[a-z][z-a]; $_ }

             package main;
             print MyClass::CustomWidget-&gt;new()-&gt;foo();

   <b>Configuring</b> <b>a</b> <b>Factory</b>
       Factories support methods that control which classes they will use.

       The base class will be inherited from by all mixed classes.

         $factory-&gt;base_class( "HelloWorld" );

       The mixin prefix is prepended to the mixin names passed to the <b>class()</b> method. Mixin names that contain a
       "::" are assumed to be fully qualified and are not changed. If empty, the base_class is used.

         $factory-&gt;mixin_prefix( 'HelloFeature' );

       The mixed prefix is at the start of all generated class names. If empty, the base_class is used,  or  the
       factory's class name.

         $factory-&gt;mixed_prefix( 'HelloClass' );

   <b>Writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mixin</b> <b>Class</b>
       Writing  a  mixin class is almost the same as writing a subclass, except where methods need to redispatch
       to the base-class implementation. (The SUPER::method syntax will only search for classes that  the  mixin
       itself  inherits  from;  to  search  back  up  the  inheritance  tree and explore other branches, another
       redispatch mechanism is needed.)

       A method named NEXT is provided to continue the search through to the next class which provides  a  given
       method.  The  order in which mixins are stacked is significant, so the caller should understand how their
       behaviors interact. (See Class::MixinFactory::NEXT.)
