</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Global - Global data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package MyClass;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Global (
           scalar =&gt; [ 'foo' ],
           array  =&gt; [ 'my_list' ],
           hash   =&gt; [ 'my_index' ],
         );
         ...

         MyClass-&gt;foo( 'Foozle' );
         print MyClass-&gt;foo();

         print MyClass-&gt;new(...)-&gt;foo(); # same value for any instance
         print MySubclass-&gt;foo();        # ... and for any subclass

         MyClass-&gt;my_list(0 =&gt; 'Foozle', 1 =&gt; 'Bang!');
         print MyClass-&gt;<a href="../man1/my_list.1.html">my_list</a>(1);

         MyClass-&gt;my_index('broccoli' =&gt; 'Blah!', 'foo' =&gt; 'Fiddle');
         print MyClass-&gt;my_index('foo');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Standard::Global suclass of MakeMethods provides basic accessors for shared data.

   <b>Calling</b> <b>Conventions</b>
       When you "use" this package, the method names you provide as arguments cause subroutines to be generated
       and installed in your module.

       See "Calling Conventions" in Class::MakeMethods::Standard for more information.

   <b>Declaration</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       To declare methods, pass in pairs of a method-type name followed by one or more method names.

       Valid method-type names for this package are listed in "METHOD GENERATOR TYPES".

       See "Declaration Syntax" in Class::MakeMethods::Standard and "Parameter Syntax" in
       Class::MakeMethods::Standard for more information.

</pre><h4><b>METHOD</b> <b>GENERATOR</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>scalar</b> <b>-</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   May  be  called as a class method, or on any instance or subclass, and behaves identically regardless
           of what it was called on.

       •   If called without any arguments returns the current value.

       •   If called with an argument, stores that as the value, and returns it,

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyClass;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Global (
           scalar =&gt; 'foo',
         );
         ...

         # Store value
         MyClass-&gt;foo('Foozle');

         # Retrieve value
         print MyClass-&gt;foo;

   <b>array</b> <b>-</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Ref</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   May be called as a class method, or on any instance or subclass, and behaves  identically  regardless
           of what it was called on.

       •   The global value will be a reference to an array (or undef).

       •   If called without any arguments, returns the current array-ref value (or undef).

       •   If  called  with  a  single  non-ref  argument,  uses  that argument as an index to retrieve from the
           referenced array, and returns that value (or undef).

       •   If called with a single array ref argument, uses that list to return a slice of the referenced array.

       •   If called with a list of argument pairs, each with a non-ref index and an  associated  value,  stores
           the value at the given index in the referenced array. If the global value was previously undefined, a
           new  array  is  autovivified.  The  current  value  in  each  position will be overwritten, and later
           arguments with the same index will override earlier ones. Returns the current array-ref value.

       •   If called with a list of argument pairs, each with the first item being a reference to an array of up
           to two numbers, loops over each pair and uses those numbers to splice the value array.

           The first controlling number is the position at which the splice will begin. Zero will  start  before
           the first item in the list. Negative numbers count backwards from the end of the array.

           The second number is the number of items to be removed from the list. If it is omitted, or undefined,
           or zero, no items are removed. If it is a positive integer, that many items will be returned.

           If  both  numbers  are  omitted,  or  are both undefined, they default to containing the entire value
           array.

           If the second argument is undef, no values will be inserted; if it is a non-reference value, that one
           value will be inserted; if it is an array-ref, its values will be copied.

           The method returns the items that removed from the array, if any.

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyClass;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Global (
           array =&gt; 'bar',
         );
         ...

         # Clear and set contents of list
         print MyClass-&gt;bar([ 'Spume', 'Frost' ] );

         # Set values by position
         MyClass-&gt;bar(0 =&gt; 'Foozle', 1 =&gt; 'Bang!');

         # Positions may be overwritten, and in any order
         MyClass-&gt;bar(2 =&gt; 'And Mash', 1 =&gt; 'Blah!');

         # Retrieve value by position
         print MyClass-&gt;<a href="../man1/bar.1.html">bar</a>(1);

         # Direct access to referenced array
         print scalar @{ MyClass-&gt;bar() };

       There are also calling conventions for slice and splice operations:

         # Retrieve slice of values by position
         print join(', ', MyClass-&gt;bar( undef, [0, 2] ) );

         # Insert an item at position in the array
         MyClass-&gt;bar([3], 'Potatoes' );

         # Remove 1 item from position 3 in the array
         MyClass-&gt;bar([3, 1], undef );

         # Set a new value at position 2, and return the old value
         print MyClass-&gt;bar([2, 1], 'Froth' );

   <b>hash</b> <b>-</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Ref</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   May be called as a class method, or on any instance or subclass, and behaves  identically  regardless
           of what it was called on.

       •   The global value will be a reference to a hash (or undef).

       •   If  called  without  any  arguments,  returns  the  contents  of  the hash in list context, or a hash
           reference in scalar context (or undef).

       •   If called with one non-ref argument, uses that argument as an index to retrieve from  the  referenced
           hash, and returns that value (or undef).

       •   If  called  with  one  array-ref argument, uses the contents of that array to retrieve a slice of the
           referenced hash.

       •   If called with one hash-ref argument, sets  the  contents  of  the  referenced  hash  to  match  that
           provided.

       •   If  called  with  a  list  of key-value pairs, stores the value under the given key in the referenced
           hash. If the global value was previously undefined, a new hash is  autovivified.  The  current  value
           under each key will be overwritten, and later arguments with the same key will override earlier ones.
           Returns the contents of the hash in list context, or a hash reference in scalar context.

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyClass;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Global (
           hash =&gt; 'baz',
         );
         ...

         # Set values by key
         MyClass-&gt;baz('foo' =&gt; 'Foozle', 'bar' =&gt; 'Bang!');

         # Values may be overwritten, and in any order
         MyClass-&gt;baz('broccoli' =&gt; 'Blah!', 'foo' =&gt; 'Fiddle');

         # Retrieve value by key
         print MyClass-&gt;baz('foo');

         # Retrieve slice of values by position
         print join(', ', MyClass-&gt;baz( ['foo', 'bar'] ) );

         # Direct access to referenced hash
         print keys %{ MyClass-&gt;baz() };

         # Reset the hash contents to empty
         @{ MyClass-&gt;baz() } = ();

   <b>object</b> <b>-</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Ref</b> <b>Accessor</b>
       For each method name passed, uses a closure to generate a subroutine with the following characteristics:

       •   May  be  called as a class method, or on any instance or subclass, and behaves identically regardless
           of what it was called on.

       •   The global value will be a reference to an object (or undef).

       •   If called without any arguments returns the current value.

       •   If called with an argument, stores that as the value, and returns it,

       Sample declaration and usage:

         package MyClass;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Standard::Global (
           object =&gt; 'foo',
         );
         ...

         # Store value
         MyClass-&gt;foo( Foozle-&gt;new() );

         # Retrieve value
         print MyClass-&gt;foo;
