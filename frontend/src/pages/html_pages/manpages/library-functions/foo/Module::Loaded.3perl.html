       Module::Loaded - mark modules as loaded or unloaded

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Module::Loaded;

           $bool = mark_as_loaded('Foo');   # Foo.pm is now marked as loaded
           $loc  = is_loaded('Foo');        # location of Foo.pm set to the
                                            # loaders location
           eval "require 'Foo'";            # is now a no-op

           $bool = mark_as_unloaded('Foo'); # Foo.pm no longer marked as loaded
           eval "require 'Foo'";            # Will try to find Foo.pm in @INC

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When testing applications, often you find yourself needing to provide functionality in your test
       environment that would usually be provided by external modules. Rather than munging the %INC by hand to
       mark these external modules as loaded, so they are not attempted to be loaded by perl, this module offers
       you a very simple way to mark modules as loaded and/or unloaded.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$bool</b> <b>=</b> <b>mark_as_loaded(</b> <b>PACKAGE</b> <b>);</b>
       Marks the package as loaded to perl. "PACKAGE" can be a bareword or string.

       If the module is already loaded, "mark_as_loaded" will carp about this and tell you from where the
       "PACKAGE" has been loaded already.

   <b>$bool</b> <b>=</b> <b>mark_as_unloaded(</b> <b>PACKAGE</b> <b>);</b>
       Marks the package as unloaded to perl, which is the exact opposite of "mark_as_loaded". "PACKAGE" can be
       a bareword or string.

       If the module is already unloaded, "mark_as_unloaded" will carp about this and tell you the "PACKAGE" has
       been unloaded already.

   <b>$loc</b> <b>=</b> <b>is_loaded(</b> <b>PACKAGE</b> <b>);</b>
       "is_loaded" tells you if "PACKAGE" has been marked as loaded yet.  "PACKAGE" can be a bareword or string.

       It returns falls if "PACKAGE" has not been loaded yet and the location from where it is said to be loaded
       on success.
