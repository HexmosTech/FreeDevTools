       Test::XML::XPath - Test XPath assertions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Test::XML::XPath tests =&gt; 3;
         like_xpath( '&lt;foo /&gt;', '/foo' );   # PASS
         like_xpath( '&lt;foo /&gt;', '/bar' );   # FAIL
         unlike_xpath( '&lt;foo /&gt;', '/bar' ); # PASS

         is_xpath( '&lt;foo&gt;bar&lt;/foo&gt;', '/foo', 'bar' ); # PASS
         is_xpath( '&lt;foo&gt;bar&lt;/foo&gt;', '/bar', 'foo' ); # FAIL

         # More interesting examples of xpath assertions.
         my $xml = '&lt;foo attrib="1"&gt;&lt;bish&gt;&lt;bosh args="42"&gt;pub&lt;/bosh&gt;&lt;/bish&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;';

         # Do testing for attributes.
         like_xpath( $xml, '/foo[@attrib="1"]' ); # PASS
         # Find an element anywhere in the document.
         like_xpath( $xml, '//bosh' ); # PASS
         # Both.
         like_xpath( $xml, '//bosh[@args="42"]' ); # PASS

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module allows you to assert statements about your XML in the form of XPath statements.  You can say
       that a piece of XML must contain certain tags, with so-and-so attributes, etc.  It will try to use any
       installed XPath module that it knows about.  Currently, this means XML::LibXML and XML::XPath, in that
       order.

       <b>NB</b>: Normally in XPath processing, the statement occurs from a <u>context</u> node.  In the case of <b>like_xpath()</b>,
       the context node will always be the root node.  In practice, this means that these two statements are
       identical:

          # Absolute path.
          like_xpath( '&lt;foo/&gt;', '/foo' );
          # Path relative to root.
          like_xpath( '&lt;foo/&gt;', 'foo' );

       It's probably best to use absolute paths everywhere in order to keep things simple.

       <b>NB</b>: Beware of specifying attributes.  Because they use an @-sign, perl will complain about trying to
       interpolate arrays if you don't escape them or use single quotes.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       like_xpath ( XML, XPATH [, NAME ] )
           Assert that XML (a string containing XML) matches the statement XPATH.  NAME is the name of the test.

           Returns true or false depending upon test success.

       unlike_xpath ( XML, XPATH [, NAME ] )
           This is the reverse of <b>like_xpath()</b>.  The test will only pass if XPATH <u>does</u> <u>not</u> generates any matches
           in XML.

           Returns true or false depending upon test success.

       is_xpath ( XML, XPATH, EXPECTED [, NAME ] )
           Evaluates XPATH against XML, and pass the test if the is EXPECTED.  Uses <b>findvalue()</b> internally.

           Returns true or false depending upon test success.

       set_xpath_processor ( CLASS )
           Set the class name of the XPath processor used.  It is up to you to ensure that this class is loaded.

       In all cases, XML must be well formed, or the test will fail.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Test::XML.

       XML::XPath, which is the basis for this module.

       If  you  are not conversant with XPath, there are many tutorials available on the web.  Google will point
       you at them.  The first one that I saw was: &lt;<a href="http://www.zvon.org/xxl/XPathTutorial/">http://www.zvon.org/xxl/XPathTutorial/</a>&gt;,  which  appears  to
       offer interactive XPath as well as the tutorials.
