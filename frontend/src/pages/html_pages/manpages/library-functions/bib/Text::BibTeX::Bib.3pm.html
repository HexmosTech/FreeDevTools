</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Text::BibTeX::Bib - defines the "Bib" database structure

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          $bibfile = Text::BibTeX::File $filename-&gt;new;
          $bibfile-&gt;set_structure ('Bib',
                                   # Default option values:
                                   sortby =&gt; 'name',
                                   namestyle =&gt; 'full'
                                   nameorder =&gt; 'first',
                                   atitle =&gt; 1,
                                   labels =&gt; 'numeric');

          # Alternate option values:
          $bibfile-&gt;set_option (sortby =&gt; 'year');
          $bibfile-&gt;set_option (namestyle =&gt; 'nopunct');
          $bibfile-&gt;set_option (namestyle =&gt; 'nospace');
          $bibfile-&gt;set_option (nameorder =&gt; 'last');
          $bibfile-&gt;set_option (atitle =&gt; 0);
          $bibfile-&gt;set_option (labels =&gt; 'alpha');   # not implemented yet!

          # parse entry from $bibfile and automatically make it a BibEntry
          $entry = Text::BibTeX::Entry-&gt;new($bibfile);

          # or get an entry from somewhere else which is hard-coded to be
          # a BibEntry
          $entry = Text::BibTeX::BibEntry-&gt;new(...);

          $sortkey = $entry-&gt;sort_key;
          @blocks = $entry-&gt;format;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       (<b>NOTE!</b> Do not believe everything you read in this document.  The classes described here are unfinished
       and only lightly tested.  The current implementation is a proof-of-principle, to convince myself (and
       anyone who might be interested) that it really is possible to reimplement BibTeX 0.99 in Perl using the
       core "Text::BibTeX" classes; this principle is vaguely demonstrated by the current "Bib*" modules, but
       not really proved.  Many important features needed to reimplement the standard styles of BibTeX 0.99 are
       missing, even though this document may brashly assert otherwise.  If you are interested in using these
       classes, you should start by reading and grokking the code, and contributing the missing bits and pieces
       that you need.)

       "Text::BibTeX::Bib" implements the database structure for bibliographies as defined by the standard
       styles of BibTeX 0.99.  It does this by providing two classes, "BibStructure" and "BibEntry" (the leading
       "Text::BibTeX" is implied, and will be omitted for the rest of this document).  These two classes, being
       specific to bibliographic data, are outside of the core "Text::BibTeX" class hierarchy, but are
       distributed along with it as they provide a canonical example of a specific database structure using
       classes derived from the core hierarchy.

       "BibStructure", which derives from the "Structure" class, deals with the structure as a whole: it handles
       structure options and describes all the types and fields that make up the database structure.  If you're
       interested in writing your own database structure modules, the standard interface for both of these is
       described in Text::BibTeX::Structure; if you're just interested in finding out the exact database
       structure or the options supported by the "Bib" structure, you've come to the right place.  (However, you
       may have to wade through a bit of excess verbiage due to this module's dual purpose: first, to
       reimplement the standard styles of BibTeX 0.99, and second, to provide an example for other programmers
       wishing to implement new or derived database structure modules.)

       "BibEntry" derives from the "StructuredEntry" class and provides methods that operate on individual
       entries presumed to come from a database conforming to the structure defined by the "BibStructure" class.
       (Actually, to be completely accurate, "BibEntry" inherits from two intermediate classes, "BibSort" and
       "BibFormat".  These two classes just exist to reduce the amount of code in the "Bib" module, and thanks
       to the magic of inheritance, their existence is usually irrelevant.  But you might want to consult those
       two classes if you're interested in the gory details of sorting and formatting entries from BibTeX
       0.99-style bibliography databases.)

</pre><h4><b>STRUCTURE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       "BibStructure" handles several user-supplied "structure options" and methods for dealing with them.  The
       options currently supported by the "Bib" database structure, and the values allowed for them, are:

       "sortby"
           How  to  sort entries.  Valid values: "name" (sort on author names, year, and title), "year" (sort on
           year, author names, and title).  Sorting on "author names" is a bit more complicated than just  using
           the "author" field; see Text::BibTeX::BibSort for details.  Default value: "name".

       "namestyle"
           How  to  print  author  (and  editor) names: "full" for unabbreviated first names, "abbrev" for first
           names abbreviated with periods, "nopunct" for first names abbreviated with space but no periods,  and
           "nospace" to abbreviate without space or periods.  Default value: "full".

       "nameorder"
           The order in which to print names: "first" for "first von last jr" order, and "last" for "von last jr
           first" order.  Default value: "first".

       "atitle_lower"
           A  boolean  option:  if  true,  non-book  titles  will be changed to "sentence capitalization:" words
           following colons and sentence-ending punctuation will be capitalized, and everything else  at  brace-
           depth zero will be changed to lowercase.  Default value: true.

       "labels"
           The  type  of bibliographic labels to generate: "numeric" or "alpha".  (Alphabetic labels are not yet
           implemented, so this option is currently ignored.)  Default value: "numeric".

       Also, several "markup options" are supported.  Markup options are distinct because they don't change  how
       text  is extracted from the database entries and subsequently mangled; rather, they supply bits of markup
       that go around the database-derived text.  Markup options are always  two-element  lists:  the  first  to
       "turn  on"  some  feature  of  the  markup language, and the second to turn it off.  For example, if your
       target language is LaTeX2e and you want journal names emphasized,  you  would  supply  a  list  reference
       "['\emph{','}']"  for  the  "journal_mkup" option.  If you were instead generating HTML, you might supply
       "['&lt;emph&gt;','&lt;/emph&gt;']".  To keep the structure module general  with  respect  to  markup  languages,  all
       markup  options  are  empty  by default.  (Or, rather, they are all references to lists consisting of two
       empty strings.)

       "name_mkup"
           Markup to add around the list of author names.

       "atitle_mkup"
           Markup to add around non-book (article) titles.

       "btitle_mkup"
           Markup to add around book titles.

       "journal_mkup"
           Markup to add around journal names.

   <b>Option</b> <b>methods</b>
       As required by  the  "Text::BibTeX::Structure"  module,  "Text::BibTeX::Bib"  provides  two  methods  for
       handling  options: "known_option" and "default_option".  (The other two option methods, "set_options" and
       "get_options", are just inherited from "Text::BibTeX::Structure".)

       known_option (OPTION)
           Returns true if OPTION is one of the options on the above list.

       default_option (OPTION)
           Returns the default value of OPTION, or "croak"s if OPTION is not a supported option.

</pre><h4><b>DATABASE</b> <b>STRUCTURE</b></h4><pre>
       The other purpose of a structure class is to provide a method, "describe_entry", that lists  the  allowed
       entry  types  and  the  known  fields for the structure.  Programmers wishing to write their own database
       structure module should consult Text::BibTeX::Structure for the  conventions  and  requirements  of  this
       method; the purpose of the present document is to describe the "Bib" database structure.

       The allowed entry types, and the fields recognized for them, are:

       "article"
           Required fields: "author", "title", "journal", "year".  Optional fields: "volume", "number", "pages",
           "month", "note".

       "book"
           Required  fields:  "title",  "publisher",  "year".   Optional fields: "series", "address", "edition",
           "month", "note".  Constrained fields: exactly one of "author", "editor"; at  most  one  of  "volume",
           "number".

       "booklet"
           Required  fields:  "title".   Optional  fields: "author", "howpublished", "address", "month", "year",
           "note".

       "inbook"
           Required fields: "publisher", "year".   Optional  fields:  "series",  "type",  "address",  "edition",
           "month",  "note".   Constrained fields: exactly one of "author", "editor"; at least one of "chapter",
           "pages"; at most one of "volume", "number".

       "incollection"
           Required fields: "author", "title", "booktitle", "publisher",  "year".   Optional  fields:  "editor",
           "series",  "type", "chapter", "pages", "address", "edition", "month", "note".  Constrained fields: at
           most one of "volume", "number".

       "inproceedings"
       "conference"
           Required fields: "author",  "title",  "booktitle",  "year".   Optional  fields:  "editor",  "series",
           "pages", "address", "month", "organization", "publisher", "note".  Constrained fields: at most one of
           "volume", "number".

       "manual"
           Required  fields: "title".  Optional fields: "author", "organization", "address", "edition", "month",
           "year", "note".

       "mastersthesis"
           Required fields: "author", "title", "school", "year".  Optional fields: "type",  "address",  "month",
           "note".

       "misc"
           Required fields: none.  Optional fields: "author", "title", "howpublished", "month", "year", "note".

       "phdthesis"
           Required  fields:  "author", "title", "school", "year".  Optional fields: "type", "address", "month",
           "note".

       "proceedings"
           Required  fields:  "title",  "year".   Optional  fields:  "editor",  "series",  "address",   "month",
           "organization", "publisher", "note".  Constrained fields: at most one of "volume", "number".

       "techreport"
           Required  fields:  "author",  "title",  "institution",  "year".   Optional  fields: "type", "number",
           "address", "month", "note".

       "unpublished"
           Required fields: "author", "title", "note".  Optional fields: "month", "year".

</pre><h4><b>STRUCTURED</b> <b>ENTRY</b> <b>CLASS</b></h4><pre>
       The  second  class  provided  by  the  "Text::BibTeX::Bib"  module  is  "BibEntry"  (again,   a   leading
       "Text::BibTeX" is implied).  This being a structured entry class, it derives from "StructuredEntry".  The
       conventions  and  requirements for such a class are documented in Text::BibTeX::Structure for the benefit
       of programmers implementing their own structure modules.

       If you wish to write utilities making use of the "Bib" database structure, then you should  call  one  of
       the  "officially  supported"  methods provided by the "BibEntry" class.  Currently, there are only two of
       these: "sort_key" and "format".  These are actually implemented in the "BibSort" and "BibFormat" classes,
       respectively,  which  are  base   classes   of   "BibEntry".    Thus,   see   Text::BibTeX::BibSort   and
       Text::BibTeX::BibFormat for details on these two methods.
