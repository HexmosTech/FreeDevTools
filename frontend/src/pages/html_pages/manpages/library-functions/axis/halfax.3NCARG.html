</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HALFAX - Draws orthogonal axes intersecting at a specified point and with a specified set of labels.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL HALFAX (MJRX,MNRX,MJRY,MNRY,XINT,YINT,IXLB,IYLB)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_halfax (int mjrx, int mnrx, int mjry, int mnry,
       float xint, float yint, int ixlb, int iylb)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MJRX, MNRX, MJRY, and MNRY
                   (input  expressions  of type INTEGER) specify the major and minor divisions of the horizontal
                   (X) and vertical (Y) axes of the current viewport. The meanings of these parameters depend on
                   the current setting of the internal parameter ´LS´ of SPPS:

                   •      If the value of ´LS´ implies that the axis is linear: MJRX(Y) specifies the number  of
                          major  divisions  of the X(Y) axis and MNRX(Y) specifies the number of minor divisions
                          within each major division. In each case, the value specifies  the  number  of  spaces
                          between  grid  lines  or ticks rather than the number of lines or ticks. Including the
                          ones at the ends of the axes, there is always one more major  division  line  or  mark
                          than  the  number  of major divisions specified by MJRX(Y). Similarly, there is always
                          one less minor division line or tick per major  division  than  the  number  of  minor
                          divisions per major division specified by MNRX(Y).

                   •      If  the  value of ´LS´ implies that the axis is logarithmic: Each major division point
                          occurs at a value 10**MJRX(Y) times the previous point. For example, if the minimum X-
                          axis value were 3., the maximum X-axis value 3000. and MJRX 1, then the major division
                          points would be 3., 30., 300., and  3000.  If  MNRX(Y).LE.10,  there  are  nine  minor
                          divisions  within each major division. For example, between 3. and 30., there would be
                          minor division points at 6., 9., 12., .  . . 27. If  MNRX(Y).GT.10.,  minor  divisions
                          are omitted.

       XINT and YINT
                   (input expressions of type REAL) are the user coordinates of the point of intersection of the
                   two axes.

       IXLB        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is defined as follows:

                   •      IXLB = -1 implies that no X axis is to be drawn.

                   •      IXLB = 0 implies that the X axis is to be drawn unlabeled.

                   •      IXLB = 1 implies that the X axis is to be drawn and labeled.

       IYLB        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is defined as follows:

                   •      IYLB = -1 implies that no Y axis is to be drawn.

                   •      IYLB = 0 implies that the Y axis is to be drawn unlabeled.

                   •      IYLB = 1 implies that the Y axis is to be drawn and labeled.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The statement

          CALL HALFAX (MJRX,MNRX,MJRY,MNRY,XINT,YINT,IXLB,IYLB)

       is equivalent to

          CALL GRIDAL (MJRX,MNRX,MJRY,MNRY,IXLB,IYLB,10,XINT,YINT)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant example: tgrida.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use HALFAX or c_halfax, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.
