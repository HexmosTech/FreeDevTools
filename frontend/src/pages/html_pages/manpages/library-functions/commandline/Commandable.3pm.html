</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "Commandable" - utilities for commandline-based programs

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This distribution contains a collection of utilities extracted from various commandline-based programs I
       have written, in the hope of trying to find a standard base to build these from in future.

       Note that "commandline" does not necessarily mean "plain-text running in a terminal"; simply that the
       mode of operation is that the user types a textual representation of some action, and the program parses
       this text in order to perform it. This could equally apply to a command input text area in a GUI program.

</pre><h4><b>PROGRAM</b> <b>STRUCTURE</b></h4><pre>
       A typical program using this distribution would have a single instance of a "finder", whose job is to
       work out the set of commands offered by the program.  Various subclasses of finder are provided that use
       different techniques to locate the individual commands, depending on the structure provided by the
       program.

       •   Commandable::Finder::SubAttributes  - expects to find each command implemented as a subroutine within
           a single package. These subroutines should all have attributes that  provide  description  text,  and
           specifications  of  argument  and  option  parsing.  The  code body of the subroutine is then used to
           implement the actual command.

       •   Commandable::Finder::MethodAttributes - a variant of  the  above  which  expects  that  commands  are
           implemented as methods on an object instance.

       •   Commandable::Finder::Packages  -  expects to find each command implemented as an entire package, with
           (constant) subroutines to give the description text and argument and option  parsing  specifications.
           Another subroutine within the package actually implements the command.

       As  the  user requests that commands be executed, the text of each request is then wrapped in an instance
       of Commandable::Invocation. This is then passed to the finder instance to actually invoke  a  command  by
       parsing its name, options and arguments, and run the actual code body.

          my $finder = Commandable::Finder::...-&gt;new( ... );

          my $cinv = Commandable::Invocation-&gt;new( $text );

          $finder-&gt;find_and_invoke( $cinv );

       The finder instance is not modified by individual invocations, and can be reused if the program wishes to
       provide some sort of multiple invocation ability; perhaps in the form of a REPL-like shell:

          my $finder = ...

          while( my $text = &lt;STDIN&gt; ) {
             $finder-&gt;find_and_invoke( Commandable::Invocation-&gt;new( $text ) );
          }
