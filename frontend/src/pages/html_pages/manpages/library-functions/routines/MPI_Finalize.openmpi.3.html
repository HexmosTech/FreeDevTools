          USE mpi_f08

          MPI_Finalize(ierror)
              INTEGER, OPTIONAL, INTENT(OUT) :: ierror

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>PARAMETER</b></h4><pre>
       • <b>ierror</b> : Fortran only: Error status (integer).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  routine  cleans  up all MPI states. Once this routine is called, no MPI routine (not even MPI_Init)
       may be called, except for <u>MPI_Get_version</u>, <u>MPI_Initialized</u>, and <u>MPI_Finalized</u>. Unless there  has  been  a
       call  to  <u>MPI_Abort</u>,  you  must  ensure  that all pending communications involving a process are complete
       before the process calls <u>MPI_Finalize</u>. If the call  returns,  each  process  may  either  continue  local
       computations  or  exit without participating in further communication with other processes. At the moment
       when the last process calls <u>MPI_Finalize</u>, all pending sends must be matched by a receive, and all pending
       receives must be matched by a send.

       <u>MPI_Finalize</u> is collective over all connected processes. If  no  processes  were  spawned,  accepted,  or
       connected,  then  this  means  it is collective over MPI_COMM_WORLD. Otherwise, it is collective over the
       union of all processes that have been and continue to be connected.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       All processes must call this routine before exiting. All processes will still exist but may not make  any
       further MPI calls. <u>MPI_Finalize</u> guarantees that all local actions required by communications the user has
       completed  will, in fact, occur before it returns. However, <u>MPI_Finalize</u> guarantees nothing about pending
       communications that have not been completed;  completion  is  ensured  only  by  <u>MPI_Wait</u>,  <u>MPI_Test</u>,  or
       <u>MPI_Request_free</u> combined with some other verification of completion.

       For  example,  a  successful  return from a blocking communication operation or from <u>MPI_Wait</u> or <u>MPI_Test</u>
       means that the communication is completed by the user  and  the  buffer  can  be  reused,  but  does  not
       guarantee  that  the  local  process  has  no  more  work  to  do.  Similarly,  a  successful return from
       <u>MPI_Request_free</u> with a request handle generated by an  <u>MPI_Isend</u>  nullifies  the  handle  but  does  not
       guarantee  that  the  operation has completed. The <u>MPI_Isend</u> is complete only when a matching receive has
       completed.

       If you would like  to  cause  actions  to  happen  when  a  process  finishes,  attach  an  attribute  to
       MPI_COMM_SELF  with  a  callback  function.  Then, when <u>MPI_Finalize</u> is called, it will first execute the
       equivalent of an <u>MPI_Comm_free</u> on MPI_COMM_SELF. This will cause  the  delete  callback  function  to  be
       executed  on all keys associated with MPI_COMM_SELF in an arbitrary order. If no key has been attached to
       MPI_COMM_SELF, then no callback is invoked. This freeing of MPI_COMM_SELF happens before any other  parts
       of  MPI  are affected. Calling <u>MPI_Finalized</u> will thus return “false” in any of these callback functions.
       Once you have done this with MPI_COMM_SELF, the results of <u>MPI_Finalize</u> are not specified.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as  the  return  result  of  the  function  and
       Fortran routines in the last argument.

       Before  the  error  value  is  returned,  the current MPI error handler associated with the communication
       object (e.g., communicator, window, file) is called.  If no communication object is associated  with  the
       MPI  call,  then  the call is considered attached to MPI_COMM_SELF and will call the associated MPI error
       handler.  When  MPI_COMM_SELF  is  not  initialized   (i.e.,   before   <u>MPI_Init</u>/<u>MPI_Init_thread</u>,   after
       <u>MPI_Finalize</u>,  or  when using the Sessions Model exclusively) the error raises the initial error handler.
       The initial error handler can be changed by calling <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u> on MPI_COMM_SELF  when  using
       the  World  model,  or the mpi_initial_errhandler CLI argument to mpiexec or info key to <u>MPI_Comm_spawn</u>/‐
       <u>MPI_Comm_spawn_multiple</u>.  If no other appropriate error handler has been set, then the  MPI_ERRORS_RETURN
       error  handler  is  called for MPI I/O functions and the MPI_ERRORS_ABORT error handler is called for all
       other MPI functions.

       Open MPI includes three predefined error handlers that can be used:

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL</b> Causes the program to abort all connected MPI processes.

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_ABORT</b> An error handler that can be invoked on a communicator, window, file, or session. When
         called on a communicator, it acts as if <u>MPI_Abort</u> was called on  that  communicator.  If  called  on  a
         window  or file, acts as if <u>MPI_Abort</u> was called on a communicator containing the group of processes in
         the corresponding window or file. If called on a session, aborts only the local process.

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</b> Returns an error code to the application.

       MPI applications can also implement their own error handlers by calling:

       • <u>MPI_Comm_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u>

       • <u>MPI_File_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_File_set_errhandler</u>

       • <u>MPI_Session_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Session_set_errhandler</u> or at <u>MPI_Session_init</u>

       • <u>MPI_Win_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Win_set_errhandler</u>

       Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.

       See the <u>MPI</u> <u>man</u> <u>page</u> for a full list of <u>MPI</u> <u>error</u> <u>codes</u>.

       See the Error Handling section of the MPI-3.1 standard for more information.
