</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Routine::Util - helpful exports for dealing with test routines

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.031

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Routine::Util is documented in the Test::Routine docs on running tests.  Please consult those for
       more information.

       Both "run_tests" and "run_me" are simple wrappers around the process of composing given Test::Routine
       roles into a class and instance using Test::Routine::Compositor, creating a Test::Routine::Runner object
       and telling it to execute the tests on the test instance.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
