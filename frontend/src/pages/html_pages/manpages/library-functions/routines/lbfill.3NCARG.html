</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       LBFILL - A routine that is called by LBLBAR (when the argument IFTP is non-zero) to fill portions of the
       bar. The default version of this routine does color fill by calling GSFACI and GFA.  A user-written
       version may be supplied to do a different kind of fill.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL LBFILL (IFTP, XCRA, YCRA, NCRA, INDX)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       IFTP        (an  input expression of type INTEGER) is the value of the argument IFTP from the user's call
                   to LBLBAR.

       XCRA, YCRA  (input arrays of type REAL) are real arrays containing the X and Y coordinates of five points
                   defining a rectangular box which is to be filled in some manner. The fifth point  defined  by
                   these arrays will always be a duplicate of the first.

       NCRA        (an  input  expression of type INTEGER) is the number of points defining the rectangular box.
                   Its value will always be five.

       INDX        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is one of the indices  from  the  array  LFIN,  in  the
                   user's call to LBLBAR. Its value may be used as a color index or as a pattern selector.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       This routine is called by LBLBAR when LBLBAR's argument IFTP is non-zero.  LBFILL is called once for each
       sub-box in the label bar, using a statement of the form:

              CALL LBFILL (IFTP,XCRA,YCRA,NCRA,INDX)

       and  is  expected  to fill the sub-box defined by its arguments. The default version of the routine looks
       like this:

              SUBROUTINE LBFILL (IFTP,XCRA,YCRA,NCRA,INDX)
                DIMENSION XCRA(*),YCRA(*)
                CALL GSFACI (INDX)
                CALL GFA (NCRA-1,XCRA,YCRA)
                RETURN
              END

       This version does color fill of the box, using the last argument as a color index. The user  may  replace
       this  routine  with  a  version  that  does any desired sort of fill; usually, this can be done by simply
       compiling the desired version, so that the default one from the package will not be loaded.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use LBFILL, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in that order.
