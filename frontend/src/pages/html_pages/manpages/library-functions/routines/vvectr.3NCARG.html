</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       VVECTR - Manages the coordinate system mapping, color setting, auxiliary text output, and drawing of the
       vector field plot, according to the specifications established by the parameter setting routines and the
       initialization routine, VVINIT.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL VVECTR (U,V,P,IAM,VVUDMV,WRK)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_vvectr(float *u, float *v, float *p, int *iam,
                     int (*vvudmv_)(float *xcs, float *ycs,
                     int *ncs, int *iai, int *iag, int *nai),
                     float *wrk)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       U           (REAL  2  dimensional  array,  dimensioned  as  specified  in last call to VVINIT, input): By
                   default, assumed to contain the first  dimensional  axis  components  of  the  vector  field.
                   However, if PLR is non-zero, it is treated as containing the vector magnitudes.

       V           (REAL  2  dimensional  array,  dimensioned  as  specified  in last call to VVINIT, input): By
                   default, assumed to contain the second dimensional  axis  components  of  the  vector  field.
                   However, if PLR is non-zero, it is treated as containing the vector angles.

       P           (REAL  2 dimensional array, dimensioned as specified in last call to VVINIT, input): Array of
                   scalar data that may be used to color the vectors. The grid points are  assumed  to  coincide
                   with the grid points of the U and V arrays.  Required only if CTV has an absolute value of 2;
                   otherwise this argument is ignored and may be assigned a dummy value.

       IAM         (INTEGER  array, unknown dimension, input): Area map array previously established by calls to
                   routines in the Areas utility. It is not examined or modified by Vectors.  Required  only  if
                   MSK is set to a non-zero value; otherwise it is ignored and may be assigned a dummy value.

       VVUDMV      (EXTERNAL  subroutine,  input):  User-definable  masked  drawing subroutine. See the man page
                   vvudmv for a discussion of the usage and argument list required for this subroutine. Required
                   only if MSK is set to a non-zero value; otherwise it is ignored and may be assigned  a  dummy
                   value.

       WRK         (REAL  array,  dimensioned  as  specified  in  last call to VVINIT, input/output): Work array
                   required only if the parameter VMD is set to a value greater than 0.0. Otherwise may  be  set
                   to a dummy value.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       A  call  to  VVINIT  must  precede the first call to VVECTR, and is again required any time the vector or
       scalar array data changes, any of the coordinate control parameters are modified, or the number of  color
       threshold  levels  is modified when Vectors is given the responsibility of setting up the color threshold
       value array. However, the user may modify text elements or any of the rendering control  parameters,  and
       if  assuming  responsibility  for  setting  up the color threshold array, may also modify the color array
       parameters, in between multiple invocations of VVECTR.

       Arguments to VVINIT establish the sizes of the two or three data arrays, as well  as  the  possible  work
       array.  VVINIT  places  these  values  into common block variables where they become available to VVECTR.
       Therefore no size arguments need appear in the VVECTR argument list. When there is no scalar data  array,
       area  masking  is  not  enabled, and VMD is less than or equal to 0.0, all but the first two arguments to
       VVECTR may have dummy values and the invocation would be something like:

               CALL VVECTR(U,V,IDM,IDM,IDM,IDM)

       where IDM is an arbitrary variable, INTEGER or REAL, that need not have been initialized.   However,  any
       time  the  color  threshold  control parameter, CTV has an absolute value of 2, the auxiliary scalar data
       array is expected, and the P scalar array variable needs to be specified.

       The masking capability supported by Vectors allows the user to overlay vector fields on top  of  graphics
       produced  by  other  utilities,  such  as Conpack contour plots, without encroaching on areas, like label
       boxes, that should appear in the foreground. Normally the area map should be generated and  used  in  the
       normal  way  (as  described  in  the  Areas and Conpack documentation) before calling any routines in the
       Vectors utility. When the parameter MSK has a non-zero value, masking is enabled and a previously created
       area map must be passed to VVECTR.  VVECTR examines the map, returning an error if it determines that  it
       is  an invalid map or contains more area maps that it can handle, currently 64. Otherwise its only use of
       the map is as a member of the argument list when invoking one of the Areas routines,  ARDRLN  or  ARGTAI.
       The  user  must  also  pass  in  a  user-definable  masked  drawing subroutine.  A simple version of this
       subroutine, named VVUDMV, is supplied with the Vectors utility, and may suffice for basic masked  drawing
       operations. See the vvudmv man page for more information.

       The  last  argument  in  the  calling  sequence, WRK, is used only when the parameter VMD (Vector Minimum
       Distance) is given a value greater than 0.0. In this case, Vectors uses the array to keep  track  of  the
       location  of  each  vector  in  NDC space so that the distances between vectors can be compared. Based on
       these comparisons, Vectors eliminates some vectors such that the remaining vectors are  separated  by  at
       least  the specified distance.  Otherwise the WRK argument is ignored, and may be passed a dummy argument
       value.
