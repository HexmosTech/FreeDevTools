</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dashpack - a set of routines allowing you to draw curves using dashed-line patterns that may include gap-
       portion specifiers, solid-portion specifiers, and label-string specifiers.  DASHPACK is intended to
       replace and unify the old family of NCAR Graphics routines (DASHLINE, DASHCHAR, DASHSMTH, and DASHSUPR),
       all of which date from the early 1970s or before.  At the time of its introduction, DASHPACK will do
       anything that DASHLINE, DASHCHAR, and DASHSMTH will (and a number of things that they won't); it does not
       yet functionally replace all of DASHSUPR, but it is intended that this will eventually happen.  For the
       moment, the older routines will stay in NCAR Graphics.

       Structurally, DASHPACK is rather different from the routines that it replaces: Its behavior is controlled
       by "internal parameters" that are accessed by calling parameter-access routines, rather than by
       manipulating the contents of labelled common blocks. There is only one version of DASHPACK; rather than
       load a different version of it in order to, say, turn smoothing on, one just changes the value of the
       internal parameter that controls whether or not smoothing is done. There is no analog of the old routines
       DASHDB and DASHDC in DASHPACK; to use a different dash pattern, one just changes the values of the
       internal parameters that specify what dash pattern to use.

       As in other NCAR Graphics packages, each of the internal parameters of DASHPACK has a three-character
       mnemonic name. The internal parameters are described in detail in the man page "dashpack_params".

       Dashed-Line Patterns

       A dashed-line pattern (or just "dash pattern") may be specified using either an integer or a character
       string (see the parameters 'DPL', 'DPS', and 'DPT').  However the pattern is specified, it is applied in
       a repetitive fashion as a curve is drawn. For example, if the dash pattern specifies a solid, a gap, and
       the label "A", a curve drawn using it will include a solid, a gap, the label "A", a solid, a gap, the
       label "A", and so on, until the end of the curve is reached. When a new curve is begun, use of the dash
       pattern starts over: the new curve starts with a solid, a gap, and the label "A".

       If an integer dash pattern is used, the low-order "n" bits of the integer (where "n" is the absolute
       value of the user-specified parameter, 'DPS', and is between 1 and 32, inclusive) are interpreted; 0's
       represent gaps and 1's represent solids.

       In a character-string dash pattern, the character used to represent a gap (by default, an underscore) and
       the character used to represent a solid (by default, a dollar sign) are determined by the values of other
       internal parameters ('CRG' and 'CRS'); such characters may be mixed with other strings of characters that
       are to be used as label strings. There are parameters allowing one to specify how much distance along the
       curve should be devoted to each gap ('WOG') and solid ('WOS'), what size characters should be used for
       writing label strings ('WOC'), whether label strings should be written at a fixed angle relative to the
       plotter frame or in the direction of the curve ('SAF'), and, if they are written in the direction of the
       curve, whether or not they should be made to "bend" with the curve ('CRB' and 'SCF') and whether or not
       it is allowed to rotate them by 180 degrees to make them more nearly upright on the plotter frame
       ('SAF').

       A label string written along a curve may either be placed in a gap left in the curve or just written on
       top of it ('LS1', 'LS2', and 'LTL'); the latter is most effective when the characters are written in a
       color different from that of the curve itself.

       Output of label strings is buffered so that, if the end of the curve occurs prior to the occurrence of
       the next solid or gap in the dash pattern, the curve itself may be drawn in lieu of an incomplete label,
       and so that, when labels are being made to "bend" with the curve, the entire label can be inverted, if
       necessary, so as to have the majority of it right-side up. This buffering is done by default, but may be
       turned off, if desired ('SBF').

       All character strings are written using calls to PLOTCHAR routines. There is an internal parameter
       ('PCF') that says whether to call PLCHHQ, PLCHMQ, or PLCHLQ. By default, PLCHHQ is used.

       Curve Smoothing

       Curve smoothing is turned on and off by setting a single internal parameter ('TCS') that also specifies
       the tension on the cubic splines used to do the smoothing. Another parameter ('SSL') specifies the
       distance between points used to plot the smoothed curve and another ('EPS') specifies the minimum
       distance between input points required for them to be considered separate points.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       DPCURV - draws a complete curve with a single call.

       DPDRAW - called to just draw the curve by connecting a given sequence of points.

       DPFRST - does a "pen-up" move to the first in a sequence of points defining a curve.

       DPGETC - called with the name of an internal parameter of type CHARACTER and a character variable in
       which the value of that parameter is to be returned.

       DPGETI - called with the name of an internal parameter of type INTEGER or REAL and an integer variable in
       which the integer equivalent of the value of that parameter is to be returned.

       DPGETR - called with the name of an internal parameter of type INTEGER or REAL and a real variable in
       which the real equivalent of the value of that parameter is to be returned.

       DPLAST - called to say that the latest call to DPVECT was the last one in the sequence, that drawing of
       the curve should be completed, and that buffers should be flushed.

       DPLINE - draws the straight line joining two points. (No smoothing takes place, even if smoothing is
       turned on.)

       DPSETC - called with the name of an internal parameter of type CHARACTER and a character variable or
       constant that is to supply the new value of that parameter.

       DPSETI - called with the name of an internal parameter of type INTEGER or REAL and an integer expression
       that is to become the new value of that parameter.

       DPSETR - called with the name of an internal parameter of type INTEGER or REAL and a real expression that
       is to become the new value of that parameter.

       DPSMTH - called to create a smooth curve passing through a sequence of points and then to interpolate
       points along that smoothed curve and pass them on to DPDRAW.

       DPVECT - does a "pen-down" move to the next in a sequence of points defining a curve.

       To use the Dashpack C or Fortran routines, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and
       ncarg_c, preferably in that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       When error conditions are detected, the support routine SETER is called. By default, SETER writes a
       message to the standard error file (as defined by <a href="../man4/I1MACH.4.html">I1MACH</a>(4)) and then terminates execution.  It is
       possible to put SETER into recovery mode and regain control after a recoverable error (which includes all
       of the possible errors).

       The possible error messages are listed below.  All errors are recoverable in the sense that a user
       program which has called ENTSR to set recovery mode will get control back after one of these errors
       occurs.

            DPCURV - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR

            This error message indicates that, at the time DPCURV was called, there was an unrecovered
            outstanding error. In this case, DPCURV cannot continue; it forces the error message for the
            outstanding error to be printed and then substitutes this one for it.

            DPDRAW - IMPLEMENTATION ERROR - SEE SPECIALIST

            An internal error has occurred which indicates that DASHPACK has not been correctly installed. See a
            specialist.

            DPDRAW - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR

            This error message indicates that, at the time DPDRAW was called, there was an unrecovered
            outstanding error. In this case, DPDRAW cannot continue; it forces the error message for the
            outstanding error to be printed and then substitutes this one for it.

            DPFRST - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR

            This error message indicates that, at the time DPFRST was called, there was an unrecovered
            outstanding error. In this case, DPFRST cannot continue; it forces the error message for the
            outstanding error to be printed and then substitutes this one for it.

            DPGETC - PARAMETER NAME NOT KNOWN - X

            The first argument in a call to DPGETC is not one of the legal internal parameter names of DASHPACK.
            "X" is the value of the offending first argument.

            DPGETC - PARAMETER NAME TOO SHORT - X

            The given parameter name is only one or two characters long. All DASHPACK parameter names are at
            least three characters long, so there is something wrong. "X" is the value of the offending first
            argument.

            DPGETC - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR

            This error message indicates that, at the time DPGETC was called, there was an unrecovered
            outstanding error. In this case, DPGETC cannot continue; it forces the error message for the
            outstanding error to be printed and then substitutes this one for it.

            DPGETI - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR

            This error message indicates that, at the time DPGETI was called, there was an unrecovered
            outstanding error. In this case, DPGETI cannot continue; it forces the error message for the
