</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These procedures provide facilities for drawing window borders in a way that produces a three-dimensional
       appearance.   <b>Tk_Alloc3DBorderFromObj</b>  allocates colors and Pixmaps needed to draw a border in the window
       given by the <u>tkwin</u> argument.  The value of <u>objPtr</u> is a standard Tk color name that determines the  border
       colors.   The  color  indicated  by  <u>objPtr</u>  will  not  actually be used in the border;  it indicates the
       background color for the window (i.e. a color for flat surfaces).  The illuminated portions of the border
       will appear brighter than indicated by <u>objPtr</u>, and the shadowed portions of the border will appear darker
       than <u>objPtr</u>.

       <b>Tk_Alloc3DBorderFromObj</b> returns a token that may be used in later calls  to  <b>Tk_Draw3DRectangle</b>.   If  an
       error  occurs  in  allocating information for the border (e.g. a bogus color name was given) then NULL is
       returned and an error message is left as the result of interpreter <u>interp</u>.  If it  returns  successfully,
       <b>Tk_Alloc3DBorderFromObj</b> caches information about the return value in <u>objPtr</u>, which speeds up future calls
       to <b>Tk_Alloc3DBorderFromObj</b> with the same <u>objPtr</u> and <u>tkwin</u>.

       <b>Tk_ClipDrawableToRect</b>  will  clip  all  drawing  into  the drawable <u>d</u> to the given rectangle. If <u>width</u> or
       <u>height</u> are negative, reset to no clipping.  Subsequent drawing into <u>d</u> is offset and clipped as specified.
       The function is only used when <b>TK_NO_DOUBLE_BUFFERING</b> is specified at compile time.

       <b>Tk_DrawHighlightBorder</b> draws a rectangular ring around the outside of a widget to indicate  that  it  has
       received  the  input  focus.   On the Macintosh, this puts a 1 pixel border in the bgGC color between the
       widget and the focus ring, except in the case where highlightWidth is 0 or 1, in which case the border is
       left out.  For proper Mac L&amp;F, use highlightWidth of 3.

       <b>Tk_Get3DBorder</b> is identical to <b>Tk_Alloc3DBorderFromObj</b> except that the color is specified with  a  string
       instead  of  a  value.   This prevents <b>Tk_Get3DBorder</b> from caching the return value, so <b>Tk_Get3DBorder</b> is
       less efficient than <b>Tk_Alloc3DBorderFromObj</b>.

       <b>Tk_Get3DBorderColors</b> returns the used colors of the given border.

       <b>Tk_Get3DBorderFromObj</b> returns the token for an existing border, given the window and color name  used  to
       create  the border.  <b>Tk_Get3DBorderFromObj</b> does not actually create the border; it must already have been
       created with a previous call to <b>Tk_Alloc3DBorderFromObj</b> or <b>Tk_Get3DBorder</b>.  The return value is cached in
       <u>objPtr</u>, which speeds up future calls to <b>Tk_Get3DBorderFromObj</b> with the same <u>objPtr</u> and <u>tkwin</u>.

       Once a border structure has been created, <b>Tk_Draw3DRectangle</b> may be invoked  to  draw  the  border.   The
       <u>tkwin</u>  argument  specifies the window for which the border was allocated, and <u>drawable</u> specifies a window
       or pixmap in which the border is to be drawn.  <u>Drawable</u> need not refer to the same window as  <u>tkwin</u>,  but
       it  must  refer  to a compatible pixmap or window:  one associated with the same screen and with the same
       depth as <u>tkwin</u>.  The <u>x</u>, <u>y</u>, <u>width</u>, and <u>height</u> arguments define the  bounding  box  of  the  border  region
       within  <u>drawable</u>  (usually  <u>x</u>  and <u>y</u> are zero and <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> are the dimensions of the window), and
       <u>borderWidth</u> specifies the number of  pixels  actually  occupied  by  the  border.   The  <u>relief</u>  argument
       indicates which of several three-dimensional effects is desired: <b>TK_RELIEF_RAISED</b> means that the interior
       of  the  rectangle  should  appear raised relative to the exterior of the rectangle, and <b>TK_RELIEF_SUNKEN</b>
       means that the interior should appear depressed.  <b>TK_RELIEF_GROOVE</b> and <b>TK_RELIEF_RIDGE</b>  mean  that  there
       should appear to be a groove or ridge around the exterior of the rectangle.

       <b>Tk_Fill3DRectangle</b>  is  somewhat  like <b>Tk_Draw3DRectangle</b> except that it first fills the rectangular area
       with the background color (one corresponding to  the  color  used  to  create  <u>border</u>).   Then  it  calls
       <b>Tk_Draw3DRectangle</b>  to  draw  a  border just inside the outer edge of the rectangular area.  The argument
       <u>relief</u> indicates the desired effect (<b>TK_RELIEF_FLAT</b> means no border should be drawn; all that happens  is
       to fill the rectangle with the background color).

       The  procedure  <b>Tk_Draw3DPolygon</b>  may  be  used  to  draw  more  complex  shapes with a three-dimensional
       appearance.  The <u>pointPtr</u> and <u>numPoints</u> arguments define a trajectory, <u>polyBorderWidth</u> indicates how wide
       the border should be (and on which side of the trajectory to draw it),  and  <u>leftRelief</u>  indicates  which
       side of the trajectory should appear raised.  <b>Tk_Draw3DPolygon</b> draws a border around the given trajectory
       using  the  colors from <u>border</u> to produce a three-dimensional appearance.  If the trajectory is non-self-
       intersecting, the appearance will be a raised or sunken polygon  shape.   The  trajectory  may  be  self-
       intersecting, although it's not clear how useful this is.

       <b>Tk_Fill3DPolygon</b>  is  to <b>Tk_Draw3DPolygon</b> what <b>Tk_Fill3DRectangle</b> is to <b>Tk_Draw3DRectangle</b>:  it fills the
       polygonal area with the background color from <u>border</u>, then calls <b>Tk_Draw3DPolygon</b> to draw a border around
       the area (unless <u>leftRelief</u> is <b>TK_RELIEF_FLAT</b>; in this case no border is drawn).

       The procedures <b>Tk_3DVerticalBevel</b> and <b>Tk_3DHorizontalBevel</b> provide lower-level  drawing  primitives  that
       are  used  by procedures such as <b>Tk_Draw3DRectangle</b>.  These procedures are also useful in their own right
       for drawing rectilinear border shapes.  <b>Tk_3DVerticalBevel</b> draws a vertical beveled  edge,  such  as  the
       left  or right side of a rectangle, and <b>Tk_3DHorizontalBevel</b> draws a horizontal beveled edge, such as the
       top or bottom of a rectangle.  Each procedure takes <u>x</u>, <u>y</u>, <u>width</u>, and <u>height</u> arguments that  describe  the
       rectangular  area  of  the  beveled  edge  (e.g., <u>width</u> is the border width for <b>Tk_3DVerticalBevel</b>).  The
       <u>leftBorder</u> and <u>topBorder</u> arguments indicate the position of the border relative to the  “inside”  of  the
       value,  and  <u>relief</u>  indicates  the  relief  of  the  inside  of  the  value  relative  to  the  outside.
       <b>Tk_3DVerticalBevel</b> just draws a rectangular region.  <b>Tk_3DHorizontalBevel</b> draws a trapezoidal  region  to
       generate  mitered  corners;   it  should be called after <b>Tk_3DVerticalBevel</b> (otherwise <b>Tk_3DVerticalBevel</b>
       will overwrite the mitering in the corner).  The <u>leftIn</u> and  <u>rightIn</u>  arguments  to  <b>Tk_3DHorizontalBevel</b>
       describe  the  mitering at the corners;  a value of 1 means that the bottom edge of the trapezoid will be
       shorter than the top, 0 means it will be longer.  For example, to draw a rectangular border the top bevel
       should be drawn with 1 for both <u>leftIn</u> and <u>rightIn</u>, and the bottom bevel should be drawn with 0 for  both
       arguments.

       The  procedure  <b>Tk_SetBackgroundFromBorder</b>  will  modify  the  background pixel and/or pixmap of <u>tkwin</u> to
       produce a result compatible with <u>border</u>.  For color displays, the resulting background will just  be  the
       color  specified  when  <u>border</u>  was created;  for monochrome displays, the resulting background will be a
       light stipple pattern, in order to distinguish the background from the illuminated portion of the border.

       Given a token for a border, the procedure <b>Tk_NameOf3DBorder</b> will return the color name that was  used  to
       create the border.

       The procedure <b>Tk_3DBorderColor</b> returns the XColor structure that will be used for flat surfaces drawn for
       its  <u>border</u>  argument  by  procedures like <b>Tk_Fill3DRectangle</b>.  The return value corresponds to the color
       name that was used to create the border.  The  XColor,  and  its  associated  pixel  value,  will  remain
       allocated as long as <u>border</u> exists.

       The procedure <b>Tk_3DBorderGC</b> returns one of the X graphics contexts that are used to draw the border.  The
       argument  <u>which</u>  selects which one of the three possible GC's: <b>TK_3D_FLAT_GC</b> returns the context used for
       flat surfaces, <b>TK_3D_LIGHT_GC</b> returns the context  for  light  shadows,  and  <b>TK_3D_DARK_GC</b>  returns  the
       context for dark shadows.

       When  a border is no longer needed, <b>Tk_Free3DBorderFromObj</b> or <b>Tk_Free3DBorder</b> should be called to release
       the resources associated with it.  For <b>Tk_Free3DBorderFromObj</b> the border to release is specified with the
       window and color name used to create the border; for <b>Tk_Free3DBorder</b> the border to release  is  specified
