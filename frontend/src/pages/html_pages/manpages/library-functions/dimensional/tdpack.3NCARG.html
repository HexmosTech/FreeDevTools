</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tdpack - A set of routines allowing one to draw representations of three-dimensional objects.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       TDPACK (which stands for "Three Dimensional PACKage") is a collection of routines for projecting objects
       from a 3-dimensional coordinate system having U, V, and W axes to a 2-dimensional projection plane having
       X and Y axes and/or for drawing the projections of those objects.  This can be referred to somewhat
       loosely as "drawing objects in three dimensions".

       Tdpack consists of the following routines:

       Initialization Routines:

         TDINIT - Define eye position, line of sight, up direction, and stereo flag.

         TDPARA - Define the reference parallelogram.

         TDCLRS - Define colors for TDPACK.

       Parameter-Access Routines:

         TDGETI - Get the integer value of an internal parameter.

         TDGETR - Get the real value of an internal parameter.

         TDGTRS - Get the definition of a specified rendering style.

         TDSETI - Set the integer value of an internal parameter.

         TDSETR - Set the real value of an internal parameter.

         TDSTRS - Define a specified rendering style.

       Point-Transforming Routines:

         TDPRPT - Project from 3-space to the projection plane.

         TDPRPA - Project from 3-space to the plane of the reference parallelogram.

         TDPRPI - Project from the plane of the reference parallelogram to 3-space.

       Line-Drawing Routines:

         TDLINE - Draw the projection of a line in 3-space.

         TDLNPA - Draw the projection of a line in the plane of the reference parallelogram.

       Grid-Drawing Routines:

         TDGRDS - Draw the grids on all the faces of a box in 3-space.

         TDGRID - Draw the grid on a particular face of a box in 3-space.

       Label-Drawing Routines:

         TDLBLS - Draw labels for all faces of a box in 3-space.

         TDLBLA - Draw labels for a particular face of a box in 3-space.

         TDPLCH - Draw characters in the plane of the reference parallelogram.

       Surface-Drawing Routines:

         TDDTRI - Draw triangles defined by a triangle list.

         TDSTRI - Add triangles defining a simple surface to a triangle list.

         TDITRI - Add triangles defining an isosurface to a triangle list.

         TDMTRI - Add triangles defining a 3D marker to a triangle list.

         TDCTRI - Order the triangles in a triangle list for proper rendering.

         TDSORT - Cut triangles with a plane perpendicular to one of the axes.

         TDOTRI - Generic sorting routine

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use Tdpack, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       When  error  conditions  are  detected,  the  support routine SETER is called. By default, SETER writes a
       message to the standard error file (as defined by  <a href="../man4/I1MACH.4.html">I1MACH</a>(4))  and  then  terminates  execution.   It  is
       possible to put SETER into recovery mode and regain control after a recoverable error (which includes all
       of the possible errors).

       The  possible  error  messages  are  listed  below.   All errors are recoverable in the sense that a user
       program which has called ENTSR to set recovery mode will get control  back  after  one  of  these  errors
       occurs.

            TDGETI - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR
            TDGETR - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR
            TDGETR - UNRECOGNIZED PARAMETER NAME
            TDINIT - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR
            TDPARA - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR
            TDPRPA - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR
            TDPRPI - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR
            TDPRPT - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR
            TDSETI - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR
            TDSETR - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR
            TDSETR - UNRECOGNIZED PARAMETER NAME
