       ttk::intro - Introduction to the Tk theme engine
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       The  Tk  themed  widget  set  is  based  on  a  revised and enhanced version of TIP #48 (https://tip.tcl-
       lang.org/48) specified style engine.  The main concepts are  described  below.   The  basic  idea  is  to
       separate,  to  the  extent possible, the code implementing a widget's behavior from the code implementing
       its appearance.  Widget class bindings are primarily responsible for maintaining  the  widget  state  and
       invoking  callbacks;  all  aspects  of  the widget's appearance are controlled by the style of the widget
       (i.e. the style of the elements of the widget).

</pre><h4><b>THEMES</b></h4><pre>
       A <u>theme</u> is a collection of elements and styles that determine the  look  and  feel  of  the  widget  set.
       Themes can be used to:

       •      isolate platform differences (X11 vs. classic Windows vs. XP vs. Aqua ...)

       •      adapt to display limitations (low-color, grayscale, monochrome, tiny screens)

       •      accessibility (high contrast, large type)

       •      application suite branding

       •      blend in with the rest of the desktop (Gnome, KDE, Java)

       •      and, of course: eye candy.

</pre><h4><b>ELEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       An  <u>element</u>  displays  an individual part of a widget.  For example, a vertical scrollbar widget contains
       <b>uparrow</b>, <b>downarrow</b>, <b>trough</b> and <b>slider</b> elements.

       Element names use a recursive dotted notation.  For example, <b>uparrow</b> identifies a generic arrow  element,
       and  <b>Scrollbar.uparrow</b>  and  <b>Combobox.uparrow</b>  identify  widget-specific  elements.   When looking for an
       element, the style engine looks for the specific name first, and if an element of that name is not  found
       it looks for generic elements by stripping off successive leading components of the element name.

       Like  widgets,  elements  have <u>options</u> which specify what to display and how to display it.  For example,
       the <b>text</b> element (which displays a text string) has <b>-text</b>, <b>-font</b>, <b>-foreground</b>,  <b>-background</b>,  <b>-underline</b>,
       and <b>-width</b> options.  The value of an element option is taken from (in precedence order):

       •      an option of the same name and type in the widget containing the element;

       •      a dynamic setting specified by <b>style</b> <b>map</b> and the current state;

       •      the default setting specified by <b>style</b> <b>configure</b>; or

       •      the element's built-in default value for the option.

</pre><h4><b>LAYOUTS</b></h4><pre>
       A  <u>layout</u>  specifies which elements make up a widget and how they are arranged.  The layout engine uses a
       simplified version of the <b>pack</b> algorithm: starting with an initial  cavity  equal  to  the  size  of  the
       widget,  elements  are allocated a parcel within the cavity along the side specified by the <b>-side</b> option,
       and placed within the parcel according to the <b>-sticky</b> option.  For example, the layout for  a  horizontal
       scrollbar is:

              ttk::<b>style</b> <b>layout</b> Horizontal.TScrollbar {
                  Scrollbar.trough -children {
                Scrollbar.leftarrow  -side left  -sticky w
                Scrollbar.rightarrow -side right -sticky e
                Scrollbar.thumb -sticky ew
                  }
              }

       By  default,  the layout for a widget is the same as its class name.  Some widgets may override this (for
       example, the <b>ttk::scrollbar</b> widget chooses different layouts based on the <b>-orient</b> option).

</pre><h4><b>STATES</b></h4><pre>
       In standard Tk, many widgets have a <b>-state</b> option which (in most cases) is  either  <b>normal</b>  or  <b>disabled</b>.
       Some  widgets  support  additional  states,  such  as the <b>entry</b> widget which has a <b>readonly</b> state and the
       various flavors of buttons which have <b>active</b> state.

       The themed Tk widgets generalizes this idea: every widget  has  a  bitmap  of  independent  state  flags.
       Widget  state  flags  include  <b>active</b>, <b>disabled</b>, <b>pressed</b>, <b>focus</b>, etc., (see <u>ttk::<a href="../man3tk/widget.3tk.html">widget</a>(3tk)</u> for the full
       list of state flags).

       Instead of a <b>-state</b> option, every widget now has a <b>state</b> widget command which is used to set or query the
       state.  A <u>state</u> <u>specification</u> is a list of symbolic state names  indicating  which  bits  are  set,  each
       optionally prefixed with an exclamation point indicating that the bit is cleared instead.

       For example, the class bindings for the <b>ttk::button</b> widget are:

              bind TButton &lt;Enter&gt;{ %W state active }
              bind TButton &lt;Leave&gt;{ %W state !active }
              bind TButton &lt;Button-1&gt;{ %W state pressed }
              bind TButton &lt;Button1-Leave&gt;{ %W state !pressed }
              bind TButton &lt;Button1-Enter&gt;{ %W state pressed }
              bind TButton &lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;\
                  { %W instate {pressed} { %W state !pressed ; %W invoke } }

       This  specifies  that  the widget becomes <b>active</b> when the pointer enters the widget, and inactive when it
       leaves.  Similarly it becomes <b>pressed</b> when the mouse button is pressed, and <b>!pressed</b> on the ButtonRelease
       event.  In addition, the button unpresses if pointer is dragged outside the widget while Button-1 is held
       down, and represses if it's dragged back in.  Finally, when the mouse button is  released,  the  widget's
       <b>-command</b>  is invoked, but only if the button is currently in the <b>pressed</b> state.  (The actual bindings are
       a little more complicated than the above, but not by much).

</pre><h4><b>STYLES</b></h4><pre>
       Each widget is associated with a <u>style</u>, which specifies values for element options.  Style  names  use  a
       recursive  dotted notation like layouts and elements; by default, widgets use the class name to look up a
       style in the current theme.  For example:

              ttk::<b>style</b> <b>configure</b> TButton \
                -background #d9d9d9 \
                -foreground black \
                -relief raised \
                ;

       Many elements are displayed differently depending on the widget  state.   For  example,  buttons  have  a
       different  background  when they are active, a different foreground when disabled, and a different relief
       when pressed.  The <b>style</b> <b>map</b> command specifies dynamic option settings for a particular style:

              ttk::<b>style</b> <b>map</b> TButton \
                -background [list disabled #d9d9d9  active #ececec] \
                -foreground [list disabled #a3a3a3] \
                -relief [list {pressed !disabled} sunken] \
                ;
