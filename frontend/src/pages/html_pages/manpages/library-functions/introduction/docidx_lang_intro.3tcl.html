       docidx_lang_intro - docidx language introduction

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document is an informal introduction to version 1 of the docidx markup language based on a multitude
       of  examples.  After  reading  this  a  writer  should be ready to understand the two parts of the formal
       specification, i.e. the <u>docidx</u> <u>language</u> <u>syntax</u> specification and the <u>docidx</u> <u>language</u> <u>command</u> <u>reference</u>.

   <b>FUNDAMENTALS</b>
       While the <u>docidx</u> <u>markup</u> <u>language</u> is quite similar to the <u>doctools</u> <u>markup</u> <u>language</u>, in the broadest  terms
       possible,  there  is  one  key difference. An index consists essentially only of markup commands, with no
       plain text interspersed between them, except for whitespace.

       Each markup command is a Tcl command surrounded by a matching pair of <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>. Inside of these delimiters
       the usual rules for a Tcl command apply with regard to  word  quotation,  nested  commands,  continuation
       lines, etc. I.e.

                  ... [key {markup language}] ...

                ... [manpage thefile \
                        {file description}] ...

   <b>BASIC</b> <b>STRUCTURE</b>
       The most simple document which can be written in docidx is

                  [index_begin GROUPTITLE TITLE]
                  [index_end]

       Not  very  useful, but valid. This also shows us that all docidx documents consist of only one part where
       we will list all keys and their references.

       A more useful index will contain at least keywords, or short 'keys', i.e. the phrases which were indexed.
       So:

              [index_begin GROUPTITLE TITLE]
              [<b>key</b> <b>markup</b>]
              [<b>key</b> <b>{semantic</b> <b>markup}]</b>]
              [<b>key</b> <b>{docidx</b> <b>markup}</b>]
              [<b>key</b> <b>{docidx</b> <b>language}</b>]
              [<b>key</b> <b>{docidx</b> <b>commands}</b>]
              [index_end]

       In the above example the command <b>key</b> is used to declare the keyword phrases we wish to  be  part  of  the
       index.

       However  a truly useful index does not only list the keyword phrases, but will also contain references to
       documents associated with the keywords. Here is a made-up index  for  all  the  manpages  in  the  module
       <u>base64</u>:

              [index_begin tcllib/base64 {De- &amp; Encoding}]
              [key base64]
              [<b>manpage</b> <b>base64</b>]
              [key encoding]
              [<b>manpage</b> <b>base64</b>]
              [<b>manpage</b> <b>uuencode</b>]
              [<b>manpage</b> <b>yencode</b>]
              [key uuencode]
              [<b>manpage</b> <b>uuencode</b>]
              [key yEnc]
              [<b>manpage</b> <b>yencode</b>]
              [key ydecode]
              [<b>manpage</b> <b>yencode</b>]
              [key yencode]
              [<b>manpage</b> <b>yencode</b>]
              [index_end]

       In  the  above example the command <b>manpage</b> is used to insert references to documents, using symbolic file
       names, with each command belonging to the last <b>key</b> command coming before it.

       The other command to insert references is <b>url</b>. In contrast to <b>manpage</b> it uses explicit (possibly  format-
       specific)  urls to describe the location of the referenced document. As such this command is intended for
       the creation of references to external documents which could not be handled in any other way.

   <b>ADVANCED</b> <b>STRUCTURE</b>
       In all previous examples we fudged a bit regarding the markup actually allowed  to  be  used  before  the
       <b>index_begin</b> command opening the document.

       Instead  of  only whitespace the two templating commands <b>include</b> and <b>vset</b> are also allowed, to enable the
       writer to either set and/or import configuration settings relevant to the table of contents. I.e.  it  is
       possible to write

              [<b>include</b> <b>FILE</b>]
              [<b>vset</b> <b>VAR</b> <b>VALUE</b>]
              [index_begin GROUPTITLE TITLE]
              ...
              [index_end]

       Even  more  important, these two commands are allowed anywhere where a markup command is allowed, without
       regard for any other structure.

              [index_begin GROUPTITLE TITLE]
              [<b>include</b> <b>FILE</b>]
              [<b>vset</b> <b>VAR</b> <b>VALUE</b>]
              ...
              [index_end]

       The only restriction <b>include</b> has to obey is that the contents of the included file must be valid  at  the
       place  of the inclusion. I.e. a file included before <b>index_begin</b> may contain only the templating commands
       <b>vset</b> and <b>include</b>, a file included after a key may contain only manape or url references, and other  keys,
       etc.

   <b>ESCAPES</b>
       Beyond the 6 commands shown so far we have two more available.  However their function is not the marking
       up  of  index  structure,  but  the  insertion  of characters, namely <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>.  These commands, <b>lb</b> and <b>rb</b>
       respectively, are required because our use of [ and ] to bracket markup commands makes it  impossible  to
       directly use [ and ] within the text.

       Our  example  of  their  use  are  the  sources of the last sentence in the previous paragraph, with some
       highlighting added.

                ...
                These commands, [cmd lb] and [cmd lb] respectively, are required
                because our use of [<b>lb</b>] and [<b>rb</b>] to bracket markup commands makes it
                impossible to directly use [<b>lb</b>] and [<b>rb</b>] within the text.
                ...

</pre><h4><b>FURTHER</b> <b>READING</b></h4><pre>
       Now that this document has been digested the reader, assumed to be a <u>writer</u> of  documentation  should  be
       fortified  enough  to be able to understand the formal <u>docidx</u> <u>language</u> <u>syntax</u> specification as well. From
       here on out the <u>docidx</u> <u>language</u> <u>command</u> <u>reference</u> will also serve as the detailed specification and cheat
       sheet for all available commands and their syntax.

       To be able to validate a document while writing it, it is also recommended to  familiarize  oneself  with
       Tclapps' ultra-configurable <b>dtp</b>.

       On  the  other hand, docidx is perfectly suited for the automatic generation from doctools documents, and
       this is the route Tcllib's easy and simple <b>dtplite</b> goes, creating an index for a set of documents  behind
       the scenes, without the writer having to do so on their own.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS,</b> <b>IDEAS,</b> <b>FEEDBACK</b></h4><pre>
       This  document,  and  the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain bugs and other problems.  Please
       report such in the category  <u>doctools</u>  of  the  <u>Tcllib</u>  <u>Trackers</u>  [<a href="http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist">http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist</a>].
       Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or documentation.

       When proposing code changes, please provide <u>unified</u> <u>diffs</u>, i.e the output of <b>diff</b> <b>-u</b>.

       Note  further  that  <u>attachments</u>  are strongly preferred over inlined patches. Attachments can be made by
       going to the <b>Edit</b> form of the ticket immediately after its creation, and then using the left-most  button
       in the secondary navigation bar.
