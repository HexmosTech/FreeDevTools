</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bench_intro - bench introduction

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>bench</u>  (short  for  <u>benchmark</u> <u>tools</u>), is a set of related, yet different, entities which are working
       together for the easy creation and execution of performance test suites, also known as benchmarks.  These
       are

       [1]    A  tcl  based  language  for  the  declaration  of test cases. A test case is represented by a tcl
              command declaring the various parts needed to execute it, like setup,  cleanup,  the  commands  to
              test, etc.

       [2]    A package providing the ability to execute test cases written in that language.

       Which  of  the  more  detailed documents are relevant to the reader of this introduction depends on their
       role in the benchmarking process.

       [1]    A <u>writer</u> of benchmarks has to understand the bench language itself. A  beginner  to  bench  should
              read  the  more  informally  written  <u>bench</u>  <u>language</u> <u>introduction</u> first. Having digested this the
              formal <u>bench</u> <u>language</u> <u>specification</u> should become understandable. A writer experienced with  bench
              may only need this last document from time to time, to refresh her memory.

       [2]    A <u>user</u> of benchmark suites written in the <u>bench</u> language has to know which tools are available for
              use.   At  the  bottom  level  sits  the package <b>bench</b>, providing the basic facilities to read and
              execute files containing benchmarks written in the bench language,  and  to  manipulate  benchmark
              results.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORICAL</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This  module  and package have been derived from Jeff Hobbs' <b>tclbench</b> application for the benchmarking of
       the Tcl core and its ancestor "<u>runbench.tcl</u>".

</pre><h4><b>BUGS,</b> <b>IDEAS,</b> <b>FEEDBACK</b></h4><pre>
       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain bugs and  other  problems.   Please
       report  such in the category <u>bench</u> of the <u>Tcllib</u> <u>Trackers</u> [<a href="http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist">http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist</a>].  Please
       also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or documentation.

       When proposing code changes, please provide <u>unified</u> <u>diffs</u>, i.e the output of <b>diff</b> <b>-u</b>.

       Note further that <u>attachments</u> are strongly preferred over inlined patches. Attachments  can  be  made  by
       going  to the <b>Edit</b> form of the ticket immediately after its creation, and then using the left-most button
       in the secondary navigation bar.
