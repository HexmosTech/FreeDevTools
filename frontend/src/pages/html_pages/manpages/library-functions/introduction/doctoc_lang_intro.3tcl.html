       doctoc_lang_intro - doctoc language introduction

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  document  is  an  informal  introduction  to  version  1.1 of the doctoc markup language based on a
       multitude of examples. After reading this a writer should be ready to understand the  two  parts  of  the
       formal  specification,  i.e.  the  <u>doctoc</u>  <u>language</u>  <u>syntax</u> specification and the <u>doctoc</u> <u>language</u> <u>command</u>
       <u>reference</u>.

   <b>FUNDAMENTALS</b>
       While the <u>doctoc</u> <u>markup</u> <u>language</u> is quite similar to the <u>doctools</u> <u>markup</u> <u>language</u>, in the broadest  terms
       possible,  there is one key difference. A table of contents consists essentially only of markup commands,
       with no plain text interspersed between them, except for whitespace.

       Each markup command is a Tcl command surrounded by a matching pair of <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>. Inside of these delimiters
       the usual rules for a Tcl command apply with regard to  word  quotation,  nested  commands,  continuation
       lines, etc. I.e.

                  ... [division_start {Appendix 1}] ...

                ... [item thefile \
                        label {file description}] ...

   <b>BASIC</b> <b>STRUCTURE</b>
       The most simple document which can be written in doctoc is

                  [toc_begin GROUPTITLE TITLE]
                  [toc_end]

       This  also  shows  us  that  all  doctoc  documents consist of only one part where we will list <u>items</u> and
       <u>divisions</u>.

       The user is free to mix these as she sees fit. This is a change from version 1 of the language, which did
       not allow this mixing, but only the use of either a series of items or a series of divisions.

       We will discuss the commands for each of these two possibilities in the next sections.

   <b>ITEMS</b>
       Use the command <b>item</b> to put an <u>item</u> into a table of contents.  This  is  essentially  a  reference  to  a
       section, subsection, etc. in the document, or set of documents, the table of contents is for. The command
       takes  three  arguments,  a symbolic name for the file the item is for and two text to label the item and
       describe the referenced section.

       Symbolic names are used to preserve the convertibility of this format to any output  format.  The  actual
       name  of  any file will be inserted by the chosen formatting engine when converting the input, based on a
       mapping from symbolic to actual names given to the engine.

       Here a made up example for a table of contents of this document:

              [toc_begin Doctoc {Language Introduction}]
              [<b>item</b> <b>1</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b>]
              [<b>item</b> <b>1.1</b> <b>{Basic</b> <b>structure}</b>]
              [<b>item</b> <b>1.2</b> <b>Items</b>]
              [<b>item</b> <b>1.3</b> <b>Divisions</b>]
              [<b>item</b> <b>2</b> <b>{FURTHER</b> <b>READING}</b>]
              [toc_end]

   <b>DIVISIONS</b>
       One thing of notice in the last example in the previous section is that the referenced sections  actually
       had  a  nested  structure, something which was expressed in the item labels, by using a common prefix for
       all the sections nested under section 1.

       This kind of structure can be made more explicit in the doctoc language by using  divisions.  Instead  of
       using  a  series of plain items we use a series of divisions for the major references, and then place the
       nested items inside of these.

       Of course, instead of the nested items we can again use divisions and thus nest arbitrarily deep.

       A division is marked by two commands instead of one, one to start it, the other to close the last  opened
       division. They are:

       <b>division_start</b>
              This  command  opens a new division. It takes one or two arguments, the title of the division, and
              the symbolic name of the file it refers to. The latter is optional.  If the symbolic  filename  is
              present  then  the section title should link to the referenced document, if links are supported by
              the output format.

       <b>division_end</b>
              This command closes the last opened and not yet closed division.

       Using this we can recast the last example like this

              [toc_begin Doctoc {Language Introduction}]
              [<b>division_start</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b>]
              [item 1 {Basic structure}]
              [item 2 Items]
              [item 3 Divisions]
              [<b>division_end</b>]
              [<b>division_start</b> <b>{FURTHER</b> <b>READING}</b>]
              [<b>division_end</b>]
              [toc_end]

       Or, to demonstrate deeper nesting

              [toc_begin Doctoc {Language Introduction}]
              [<b>division_start</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b>]
              [<b>division_start</b> <b>{Basic</b> <b>structure}</b>]
              [item 1 Do]
              [item 2 Re]
              [<b>division_end</b>]
              [<b>division_start</b> <b>Items</b>]
              [item a Fi]
              [item b Fo]
              [item c Fa]
              [<b>division_end</b>]
              [<b>division_start</b> <b>Divisions</b>]
              [item 1 Sub]
              [item 1 Zero]
              [<b>division_end</b>]
              [<b>division_end</b>]
              [<b>division_start</b> <b>{FURTHER</b> <b>READING}</b>]
              [<b>division_end</b>]
              [toc_end]

       And do not forget, it is possible to freely mix items and divisions, and to have empty divisions.

              [toc_begin Doctoc {Language Introduction}]
              [item 1 Do]
              [<b>division_start</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b>]
              [<b>division_start</b> <b>{Basic</b> <b>structure}</b>]
              [item 2 Re]
              [<b>division_end</b>]
              [item a Fi]
              [<b>division_start</b> <b>Items</b>]
              [item b Fo]
              [item c Fa]
              [<b>division_end</b>]
              [<b>division_start</b> <b>Divisions</b>]
              [<b>division_end</b>]
              [<b>division_end</b>]
              [<b>division_start</b> <b>{FURTHER</b> <b>READING}</b>]
              [<b>division_end</b>]
              [toc_end]

   <b>ADVANCED</b> <b>STRUCTURE</b>
       In all previous examples we fudged a bit regarding the markup actually allowed  to  be  used  before  the
       <b>toc_begin</b> command opening the document.

       Instead  of  only whitespace the two templating commands <b>include</b> and <b>vset</b> are also allowed, to enable the
       writer to either set and/or import configuration settings relevant to the table of contents. I.e.  it  is
       possible to write

              [<b>include</b> <b>FILE</b>]
              [<b>vset</b> <b>VAR</b> <b>VALUE</b>]
              [toc_begin GROUPTITLE TITLE]
              ...
              [toc_end]

       Even  more  important, these two commands are allowed anywhere where a markup command is allowed, without
       regard for any other structure.

              [toc_begin GROUPTITLE TITLE]
              [<b>include</b> <b>FILE</b>]
              [<b>vset</b> <b>VAR</b> <b>VALUE</b>]
              ...
              [toc_end]

       The only restriction <b>include</b> has to obey is that the contents of the included file must be valid  at  the
       place  of  the  inclusion. I.e. a file included before <b>toc_begin</b> may contain only the templating commands
       <b>vset</b> and <b>include</b>, a file included in a division may contain only items or divisions commands, etc.

   <b>ESCAPES</b>
       Beyond the 6 commands shown so far we have two more available.  However their function is not the marking
       up of toc structure, but the insertion of characters,  namely  <b>[</b>  and  <b>]</b>.   These  commands,  <b>lb</b>  and  <b>rb</b>
       respectively,  are  required because our use of [ and ] to bracket markup commands makes it impossible to
       directly use [ and ] within the text.

       Our example of their use are the sources of the last  sentence  in  the  previous  paragraph,  with  some
       highlighting added.

                ...
                These commands, [cmd lb] and [cmd lb] respectively, are required
                because our use of [<b>lb</b>] and [<b>rb</b>] to bracket markup commands makes it
                impossible to directly use [<b>lb</b>] and [<b>rb</b>] within the text.
                ...

</pre><h4><b>FURTHER</b> <b>READING</b></h4><pre>
       Now  that  this  document has been digested the reader, assumed to be a <u>writer</u> of documentation should be
       fortified enough to be able to understand the formal <u>doctoc</u> <u>language</u> <u>syntax</u> specification as  well.  From
       here on out the <u>doctoc</u> <u>language</u> <u>command</u> <u>reference</u> will also serve as the detailed specification and cheat
       sheet for all available commands and their syntax.

       To  be  able  to validate a document while writing it, it is also recommended to familiarize oneself with
       Tclapps' ultra-configurable <b>dtp</b>.

       On the other hand, doctoc is perfectly suited for the automatic generation from doctools  documents,  and
       this  is  the  route  Tcllib's  easy  and  simple <b>dtplite</b> goes, creating a table of contents for a set of
       documents behind the scenes, without the writer having to do so on their own.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS,</b> <b>IDEAS,</b> <b>FEEDBACK</b></h4><pre>
       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain bugs and  other  problems.   Please
       report  such  in  the  category  <u>doctools</u>  of the <u>Tcllib</u> <u>Trackers</u> [<a href="http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist">http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist</a>].
       Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or documentation.

       When proposing code changes, please provide <u>unified</u> <u>diffs</u>, i.e the output of <b>diff</b> <b>-u</b>.

       Note further that <u>attachments</u> are strongly preferred over inlined patches. Attachments  can  be  made  by
       going  to the <b>Edit</b> form of the ticket immediately after its creation, and then using the left-most button
       in the secondary navigation bar.
