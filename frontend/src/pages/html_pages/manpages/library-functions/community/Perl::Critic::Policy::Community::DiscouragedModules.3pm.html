</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::DiscouragedModules - Various modules discouraged from use

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Various modules are discouraged by some subsets of the community, for various reasons which may include:
       buggy behavior, cruft, performance problems, maintainer issues, or simply better modern replacements.
       This is a high severity complement to Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::PreferredAlternatives.

</pre><h4><b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>AnyEvent</b>
       AnyEvent's author refuses to use public bugtracking and actively breaks interoperability. POE, IO::Async,
       and Mojo::IOLoop are widely used and interoperable async event loops.

   <b>Any::Moose</b>
       Any::Moose is deprecated. Use Moo instead.

   <b>Class::DBI</b>
       Class::DBI is an ancient database ORM &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping&gt;
       abstraction layer which is buggy and abandoned. See DBIx::Class for a more modern DBI-based ORM, or
       Mad::Mapper for a Mojolicious-style ORM.

   <b>CGI</b>
       CGI.pm is an ancient module for communicating via the CGI protocol, with tons of bad practices and cruft.
       Use a modern framework such as those based on Plack (Web::Simple, Dancer2, Catalyst) or Mojolicious, they
       can still be served via CGI if you choose. Use CGI::Tiny if you are limited to the CGI protocol.

   <b>Coro</b>
       Coro abuses Perl internals in an unsupported way. Consider Future and Future::AsyncAwait in combination
       with event loops for similar semantics.

   <b>Error</b>
       Error.pm is overly magical and discouraged by its maintainers. Try Throwable for exception classes in
       Moo/Moose, or Exception::Class otherwise. Try::Tiny or Syntax::Keyword::Try are recommended for the
       "try"/"catch" syntax.

   <b>FindBin</b>
       FindBin is often used to retrieve the absolute path to the directory containing the initially executed
       script, a mechanism which is not always logically clear. Additionally, it has serious bugs on old Perls
       and can't be updated from CPAN to fix them. The Path::This module provides similar variables and
       constants based on the absolute path to the current source file.  The lib::relative module resolves
       passed relative paths to the current source file for the common case of adding local module include
       directories.  Each of these documents examples of achieving the same behavior with core modules.

   <b>File::Slurp</b>
       File::Slurp gets file encodings all wrong, line endings on win32 are messed up, and it was written before
       layers were properly added. Use File::Slurper, "slurp" in Path::Tiny, "slurp" in Data::Munge, or "slurp"
       in Mojo::File.

   <b>HTML::Template</b>
       HTML::Template is an old and buggy module, try Template::Toolkit, Mojo::Template, or Text::Xslate
       instead, or HTML::Template::Pro if you must use the same syntax.

   <b>IO::Socket::INET6</b>
       IO::Socket::INET6 is an old attempt at an IPv6 compatible version of IO::Socket::INET, but has numerous
       issues and is discouraged by the maintainer in favor of IO::Socket::IP, which transparently creates IPv4
       and IPv6 sockets.

   <b>IP::World</b>
       IP::World was built from two free publicly available databases. However, over the years one of them was
       discontinued, and the other is no longer being updated.  Therefore the module's accuracy is ever-
       decreasing. Try GeoIP2 as an alternative.  That code is <u>also</u> deprecated, but at least its database is
       still updated.

   <b>JSON::Any</b>
       JSON::Any is deprecated. Use JSON::MaybeXS instead.

   <b>JSON::XS</b>
       JSON::XS's author refuses to use public bugtracking and actively breaks interoperability.
       Cpanel::JSON::XS is a fork with several bugfixes and a more collaborative maintainer. See also
       JSON::MaybeXS. Note that JSON (the distribution) uses JSON::XS by default when installed.

   <b>Net::IRC</b>
       Net::IRC is an ancient module implementing the IRC protocol. Use a modern event-loop-based module
       instead. Choices are POE::Component::IRC (used for Bot::BasicBot), Net::Async::IRC, and Mojo::IRC.

   <b>Switch</b>
       Switch.pm is a buggy and outdated source filter which can cause any number of strange errors, in addition
       to the problems with smart-matching shared by its replacement, "The 'switch' feature" in feature
       ("given"/"when"). Try Switch::Plain or Syntax::Keyword::Match instead.

   <b>XML::Simple</b>
       XML::Simple tries to coerce complex XML documents into perl data structures.  This leads to
       overcomplicated structures and unexpected behavior. Use a proper DOM parser instead like XML::LibXML,
       XML::TreeBuilder, XML::Twig, or Mojo::DOM.

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy is part of Perl::Critic::Community.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Occasionally you may find yourself needing to use one of these discouraged modules, and do not want the
       warnings.  You can do so by putting something like the following in a <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file like this:

           [Community::DiscouragedModules]
           allowed_modules = FindBin Any::Moose

       The same option is offered for Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::PreferredAlternatives.
