</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::PreferredAlternatives - Various modules with preferred alternatives

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Various modules have alternatives that are preferred by some subsets of the community, for various
       reasons which may include: buggy behavior, cruft, performance problems, maintainer issues, or simply
       better modern replacements.  This is a low severity complement to
       Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::DiscouragedModules.

</pre><h4><b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Getopt::Std</b>
       Getopt::Std was the original very simplistic command-line option processing module. It is now obsoleted
       by the much more complete solution Getopt::Long, which also supports short options, and is wrapped by
       modules such as Getopt::Long::Descriptive and Getopt::Long::Modern for simpler usage.

   <b>JSON</b>
       JSON.pm is old and full of slow logic. Use JSON::MaybeXS instead, it is a drop-in replacement in most
       cases.

   <b>List::MoreUtils</b>
       List::MoreUtils is a far more complex distribution than it needs to be. Use List::SomeUtils instead, or
       see List::Util or List::UtilsBy for alternatives.

   <b>Mouse</b>
       Mouse was created to be a faster version of Moose, a niche that has since been better filled by Moo. Use
       Moo instead.

   <b>Readonly</b>
       Readonly.pm is buggy and slow. Use Const::Fast or ReadonlyX instead, or the core pragma constant.

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy is part of Perl::Critic::Community.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Occasionally you may find yourself needing to use one of these non-preferred modules, and do not want the
       warnings.  You can do so by putting something like the following in a <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file like this:

           [Community::PreferredAlternatives]
           allowed_modules = Getopt::Std JSON

       The same option is offered for Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::DiscouragedModules.
