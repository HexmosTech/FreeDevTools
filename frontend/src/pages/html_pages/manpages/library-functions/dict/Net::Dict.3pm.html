</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Dict - client API for accessing dictionary servers (RFC 2229)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Net::Dict;

           $dict = Net::Dict-&gt;new('dict.server.host');
           $h    = $dict-&gt;define("word");
           foreach $i (@{$h}) {
               ($db, $def) = @{$i};
               . . .
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Net::Dict" is a perl class for looking up words and their definitions on network dictionary servers.
       "Net::Dict" provides a simple DICT client API for the network protocol described in RFC2229. Quoting from
       that RFC:

       â€¢   The  Dictionary Server Protocol (DICT) is a TCP transaction based query/response protocol that allows
           a client to access dictionary definitions from a set of natural language dictionary databases.

       An instance of Net::Dict represents a connection to a single DICT server. For example, to connect to  the
       dictionary server at "dict.org", you would write:

           $dict = Net::Dict-&gt;new('dict.org');

       A  DICT server can provide any number of dictionaries, which are referred to as <u>databases</u>.  Each database
       has a <u>name</u> and a <u>title</u>.  The name is a short identifier, typically just one word, used to refer  to  that
       database.   The  title  is  a  brief  one-line  description of the database.  For example, at the time of
       writing, the "dict.org" server has 11 databases, including a version of Webster's dictionary  from  1913.
       The name of the database is <u>web1913</u>, and the title is <u>Webster's</u> <u>Revised</u> <u>Unabridged</u> <u>Dictionary</u> <u>(1913)</u>.

       To look up definitions for a word, you use the "define" method:

        $dref = $dict-&gt;define('banana');

       This returns a reference to a list; each entry in the list is a reference to a two item list:

        [ $dbname, $definition ]

       The  first  entry  is  a <u>database</u> <u>name</u> as introduced above.  The second entry is the text of a definition
       from the specified dictionary.

   <b>MATCHING</b> <b>WORDS</b>
       In addition the looking up word definitions, you can lookup a list of words which match a given  pattern,
       using  the  <b>match()</b> method.  Each DICT server typically supports a number of <u>strategies</u> which can be used
       to match words against a pattern.  For example, using <b>prefix</b> strategy with a pattern  "anti"  would  find
       all words in databases which start with "anti":

        @mref = $dict-&gt;match('anti', 'prefix');
        foreach my $match (@{ $mref }) {
            ($db, $word) = @{ $match };
        }

       Similarly the <b>suffix</b> strategy is used to search for words which end in a given pattern.  The <b>strategies()</b>
       method is used to request a list of supported strategies - see "METHODS" for more details.

   <b>SELECTING</b> <b>DATABASES</b>
       By  default  Net::Dict  will  look in all databases on the DICT server.  This is specified with a special
       database name of "*".  You can specify the database(s) to search explicitly, as additional  arguments  to
       the <b>define</b> and <b>match</b> methods:

        $dref = $dict-&gt;define('banana', 'wn', 'web1913');

       Rather  than  specify  the  databases  to  use  every time, you can change the default from '*' using the
       "setDicts" method:

        $dict-&gt;setDicts('wn', 'web1913');

       Any subsequent calls to <b>define</b> or <b>match</b> will refer to these databases, unless over-ridden with additional
       arguments to the method.  You can find out what databases are available  on  a  server  using  the  "dbs"
       method:

        %dbhash = $dict-&gt;dbs();

       Each entry in the returned hash has the name of a database as the key, and the corresponding title as the
       value.

       There  is  another special database name - "!" - which says that all databases should be searched, but as
       soon as a definition is found, no further databases should be searched.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
        $dict = Net::Dict-&gt;new (HOST [,OPTIONS]);

       This is the constructor for a new Net::Dict object. "HOST" is the name of the remote host on which a Dict
       server is running.  This is required, and must be an explicit host name.

       The constructor makes a connection to the remote DICT server, and sends the CLIENT command,  to  identify
       the client to the server.

       <b>Note:</b>  previous versions let you give an empty string for the hostname, resulting in selection of default
       hosts.  This behaviour is no longer supported.

       "OPTIONS" are passed in a hash like fashion, using key and value pairs.  Possible options are:

       <b>Port</b>
           The port number to connect to on the remote machine for the Dict connection (a default port number is
           2628, according to RFC2229).

       <b>Client</b>
           The string to send as the CLIENT identifier.  If not set, then a default identifier for Net::Dict  is
           sent.

       <b>Timeout</b>
           Sets the timeout for the connection, in seconds.  Defaults to 120.

       <b>Debug</b>
           The  debug  level  -  a  non-zero  value  will  resulting  in  debugging information being generated,
           particularly when errors occur.  Can be changed later using the "debug" method,  which  is  inherited
           from Net::Cmd.  More on the debug method can be found in Net::Cmd.

       Making everything explicit, here's how you might call the constructor in your client:

        $dict = Net::Dict-&gt;new($HOST,
                               Port    =&gt; 2628,
                               Client  =&gt; "myclient v$VERSION",
                               Timeout =&gt; 120,
                               Debug   =&gt; 0);

       This will return "undef" if we failed to make the connection.  It will "die" if bad arguments are passed:
       no hostname, unknown argument, etc.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Unless  otherwise  stated  all  methods  return  either a <u>true</u> or <u>false</u> value, with <u>true</u> meaning that the
       operation was a success. When a method states that it returns a value, failure will be returned as  <u>undef</u>
       or an empty list.

   <b>define</b> <b>(</b> <b>$word</b> <b>[,</b> <b>@dbs]</b> <b>)</b>
       returns a reference to an array, whose members are lists, consisting of two elements: the dictionary name
       and the definition.  If no dictionaries are specified, those set by <b>setDicts()</b> are used.

   <b>match</b> <b>(</b> <b>$pattern,</b> <b>$strategy</b> <b>[,</b> <b>@dbs]</b> <b>)</b>
       Looks  for words which match $pattern according to the specified matching $strategy.  Returns a reference
       to an array, each entry of which is a reference to a two-element array: database name, matching word.

   <b>dbs</b>
       Returns a hash with information on the databases available on the DICT server.  The keys  are  the  short
       names, or identifiers, of the databases; the value is title of the database:

        %dbhash = $dict-&gt;dbs();
        print "Available dictionaries:\n";
        while (($db, $title) = each %dbhash) {
            print "$db : $title\n";
        }

       This is the "SHOW DATABASES" command from RFC 2229.

   <b>dbInfo</b> <b>(</b> <b>$dbname</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns a string, containing description of the dictionary $dbname.

   <b>setDicts</b> <b>(</b> <b>@dicts</b> <b>)</b>
       Specify the dictionaries that will be searched during the successive <b>define()</b> or <b>match()</b> calls.  Defaults
       to  '*'.  No existence checks are performed by this interface, so you'd better make sure the dictionaries
       you specify are on the server (e.g. by calling <b>dbs()</b>).

   <b>strategies</b>
       returns an array, containing an ID of a matching strategy as a key and a verbose description as a value.

       This method was previously called <b>strats()</b>; that name for the method is  also  currently  supported,  for
       backwards compatibility.

   <b>auth</b> <b>(</b> <b>$USER,</b> <b>$PASSPHRASE</b> <b>)</b>
       Attempt  to authenticate the specified user, using the scheme described on page 18 of RFC 2229.  The user
       should be known to the server, and $PASSPHRASE is a shared secret known only to the server and the user.

       For example, if you were using dictd from dict.org, your configuration file might include the following:

        database private {
            data  "/usr/local/dictd/db/private.dict.dz"
            index "/usr/local/dictd/db/private.index"
            access { user connor }
        }

        user connor "there can be only one"

       To be able to access this database, you'd write something like the following:

        $dict = Net::Dict-&gt;new('dict.foobar.com');
        $dict-&gt;auth('connor', 'there can be only one');

       A subsequent call to the "databases" method would reveal the "private" database now accessible.  Not  all
       servers support the AUTH extension; you can check this with the <b>has_capability()</b> method, described below.

   <b>serverInfo</b>
       Returns a string, containing the information about the server, provided by the server:

        print "Server Info:\n";
        print $dict-&gt;serverInfo(), "\n";

       This is the "SHOW SERVER" command from RFC 2229.

   <b>dbTitle</b> <b>(</b> <b>$DBNAME</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns  the  title  string  for the specified database.  This is the same string returned by the "dbs()"
       method for all databases.

   <b>capabilities</b>
       Returns a list of the capabilities supported by the DICT server, as described on pages 7  and  8  of  RFC
       2229.

   <b>has_capability</b> <b>(</b> <b>$cap_name</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns true (non-zero) if the DICT server supports the specified capability; false (zero) otherwise. Eg

        if ($dict-&gt;has_capability('auth')) {
            $dict-&gt;auth('genie', 'open sesame');
        }

   <b>status</b>
       Send  the  STATUS  command to the DICT server, which will return some server-specific timing or debugging
       information.  This may be useful when debugging or tuning  a  DICT  server,  but  probably  won't  be  of
       interest to most users.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       â€¢   Need  to  add  methods for getting lists of databases and strategies in the order they're returned by
           the remote server.  Suggested by Aleksey Cheusov.

       â€¢   The following DICT commands are not currently supported:

            OPTION MIME

       â€¢   No support for firewalls at the moment.

       â€¢   Site-wide configuration isn't supported. Previous documentation suggested that it was.

       â€¢   Currently no way to specify that results of define and  match  should  be  in  HTML.  This  was  also
           previously a config option for the constructor, but it didn't do anything.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  distribution includes two example DICT clients: <b>dict</b> is a basic command-line client, and <b>tkdict</b> is a
       GUI-based client, created using Perl/Tk.

       The <b>examples</b> directory of the Net-Dict distribution includes two basic examples.  "simple.pl" illustrates
       basic use of the module, and "portuguese.pl" demos use of an English to Portuguese dictionary. Thanks  to
       Jose Joao Dias de Almeida for the examples.
