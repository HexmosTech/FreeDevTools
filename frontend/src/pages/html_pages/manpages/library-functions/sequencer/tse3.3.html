</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tse3 - Trax Sequencer Engine library version 3.0

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include files from tse3/*.h.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  TSE3  library  is  a  powerful  third generation sequencer engine written in C++. It is a 'sequencer
       engine' because it provides the actual driving force elements of a sequencer  but  provides  no  form  of
       fancy  interface.  Sequencer  applications  or multimedia presentation packages will incorporate the TSE3
       libraries to provide a user with MIDI sequencing facilities.

       TSE3 is a mature library based on a lot of experience.  Whilst  not  providing  the  user  interface,  it
       provides  a  lot of assistance to a UI.  TSE3 is supplied with a suite of utilities that act on songs (or
       parts of a song) as well as common application support services (such as undo/redoable commands).

       TSE3 uses  an  advanced,  acclaimed  'object-oriented'  song  structure  and  incorporates  functionality
       including  a  mixing  desk,  real time song alteration, song file save/load (both standard MIDI files and
       proprietary format) and so on.

       For more documentation on the TSE3 library look  in  the  'doc'  directory  in  the  source  distribution
       package.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Naturally,  TSE3  is  completely  bug free. However, if you do find something goes wrong then contact the
       author. The program can only be improved with your feedback.

</pre><h4><b>COPYRIGHT</b></h4><pre>
       Copyright (c) 2000,2001 Pete Goodliffe. See the license file in the TSE3 doc diirectory  for  a  complete
       license statement.
