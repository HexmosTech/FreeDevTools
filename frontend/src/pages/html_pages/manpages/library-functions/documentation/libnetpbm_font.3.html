</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       libnetpbm_font \- Libnetpbm PBM Font Function Manual

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  reference  manual  covers  functions  in  the  <b>libnetpbm</b>  library  for accessing fonts to draw text
       characters, using the PBM image format and the <b>libnetpbm</b> in-memory image formats.

       We actually have very little information here; this is mainly a framework for adding documentation  later
       if someone becomes interested in this facility.

       Note  that  the  primary  known  user  of  this  library is the Netpbm program <b>pbmtext</b>.  You can use that
       program's source code as an example.

</pre><h4><b>Font</b> <b>Object</b></h4><pre>
       <b>libnetpbm</b> represents a font with an object of type <b>struct</b> <b>font</b>.  The library provides functions to create
       these objects.

       The object these functions create is in newly allocated memory and  you  can't  actually  free  it.   The
       memory  may  be  in  multiple pieces, pointing to each other, and <b>libnetpbm</b> provides no destroy function.
       (This is only because of implementation laziness).

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>Functions</b></h4><pre>
       The functions are all declared in the <b>pbmfont.h</b> header file.

   <b>pbm_defaultfont</b>
       <b>Synopsis</b>

           struct font *
           pbm_defaultfont(const char * which);

       <b>Description</b>

       This returns a font object representing a font built in to <b>libnetpbm</b>.

       <u>which</u> is the name of the desired built-in font.  There are two:

       bdf

              A proportional font similar to Adobe's <b>timR12</b> font

       fixed

              A fixed space font

              <b>Copyright</b>

       The provenance of the built-in fonts are not known for sure,  but  in  2018,  the  <b>bdf</b>  font  was  almost
       identical  to  a font on which Adobe and Digital Equipment Corporation once claimed copyright.  That font
       was available in the X.org source code  in  a  collection  named  'font-adobe-75dpi',  in  a  file  named
       <b>timR12.pcf.gz</b>.

       Ergo, it is likely that the font was copied into Netpbm from that font in 1991.

       You  may  need  a  copyright license from the copyright owners of that original font not only to copy the
       <b>libnetpbm</b> code, but to execute it, thus generating copies of the glyphs of the font.

       The X.org files in 2018 indicate the following copyright claims, along with a license to  the  public  to
       copy them:

                Copyright 1984-1989, 1994 Adobe Systems Incorporated.
                Copyright 1988, 1994 Digital Equipment Corporation.

   <b>pbm_dissectfont</b>
   <b>pbm_loadfont</b>
       This function returns a font object for a font described in a file.  The file may be either a special PBM
       file  or  a  BDF  file.   The  function  determines  which it is and behaves as either <b>pbm_loadpbmfont</b> or
       <b>pbm_loadbdffont</b> accordingly.

   <b>pbm_loadpbmfont</b>
   <b>pbm_loadbdffont2</b>
   <b>pbm_loadbdffont</b>
       This is obsolete.  New programs should use <b>pbm_loadbdffont2</b> instead.

   <b>pbm_expandbdffont</b>
   <b>pbm_dumpfont</b>
