</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Search::Xapian::PostingIterator - Iterate over the list of documents indexed by a term.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This iterator represents a stream of documents indexed by a term. It overloads "++" for advancing the
       iterator, or you can explicitly call the "inc" method.  This class also overloads "eq", "ne", "==", "!=",
       and "" (stringification).

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new Constructor. Defaults to an uninitialized iterator.

       clone
       inc Advance the iterator by one. (Called implictly by "++" overloading).

       skip_to &lt;tname&gt;
           Skip  the  iterator  to term tname, or the first term after tname if tname isn't in the list of terms
           being iterated.

       get_docid
           Get the unique id of this document.

       get_wdf
           Return the wdf of the current term (if meaningful).

       positionlist_begin
           Return Search::Xapian::PositionIterator pointing to start of positionlist for current term.

       positionlist_end
           Return Search::Xapian::PositionIterator pointing to end of positionlist for current term.

       get_doclength
           Get the length of the document at the current position in the postlist.

           This information may be stored in the postlist, in which case this lookup should  be  extremely  fast
           (indeed, not require further disk access). If the information is not present in the postlist, it will
           be retrieved from the database, at a greater performance cost.

       equal &lt;term&gt;
           Checks if a term is the same as this term. Also overloaded to the "eq" and "==" operators.

       nequal &lt;term&gt;
           Checks if a term is different from this term. Also overloaded to the "ne" and "!=" operators.

       get_description
           Return a description of this object.
