</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::DocKnot - Documentation and software release management

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.24 or later and the modules File::BaseDir, File::ShareDir, Kwalify, Path::Tiny, and YAML::XS, all
       of which are available from CPAN.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       DocKnot is a system for documentation and software release management.  Its functionality is provided by
       various submodules, often invoked via the <b>docknot</b> command-line program.  For more information, see
       <b><a href="../man1/docknot.1.html">docknot</a></b>(1).

       This module only provides helper functions to load configuration and metadata that are used by its
       various submodules.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       appdata_path(PATH[, ...])
           Return  the  path  of  a  file  from the application data.  The file is specified as one or more path
           components.

           These data files are installed with App::DocKnot, but each file can be overridden  by  the  user  via
           files in <u>$HOME/.config/docknot</u> or <u>/etc/xdg/docknot</u> (or whatever $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
           are set to).  Raises a text exception if the desired file could not be located.

       load_yaml_file(PATH, SCHEMA)
           Load  a  YAML  file  with  schema checking.  PATH is the path to the file.  SCHEMA is the name of the
           schema, which will be loaded from the <u>schema</u> directory using <b>appdata_path()</b>.  See the description  of
           that method for the paths that are searched.
