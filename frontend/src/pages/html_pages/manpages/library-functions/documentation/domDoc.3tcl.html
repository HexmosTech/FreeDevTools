       domDocObjCmd <u>method</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
_________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command manipulates one particular instance of a document object. <u>method</u> indicates a specific method
       of  the  document  class. These methods should closely conform to the W3C recommendation "Document Object
       Model (Core) Level 1" (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/level-one-core.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/level-one-core.html</a>). Look at these documents
       for a deeper understanding of the functionality.

       The valid methods are:

       <b>documentElement</b> <b>?</b><u>objVar</u><b>?</b>
              Returns the top most element in the document (the root element).

       <b>getElementsByTagName</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns a list of all elements in the document matching (glob style) <u>name</u>.

       <b>getElementsByTagNameNS</b> <u>uri</u> <u>localname</u>
               Returns a list of all elements in the subtree matching (glob  style)  <u>localname</u>  and  having  the
              given namespace <u>uri</u>.

       <b>createElement</b> <u>tagName</u> <b>?</b><u>objVar</u><b>?</b>
              Creates  (allocates)  a  new element node with node name <u>tagName</u>, append it to the hidden fragment
              list in the document object and returns the node object.  If <u>objVar</u> is given the new  node  object
              is stored in this variable.

       <b>createElementNS</b> <u>url</u> <u>tagName</u> <b>?</b><u>objVar</u><b>?</b>
              Creates  (allocates)  a  new  element  node within a namespace having <u>uri</u> as the URI and node name
              <u>tagName</u>, which could include the namespace prefix, append it to the hidden fragment  list  in  the
              document  object and returns the node object.  If <u>objVar</u> is given the new node object is stored in
              this variable.

       <b>createTextNode</b> <u>text</u> <b>?</b><u>objVar</u><b>?</b>
              Creates (allocates) a new text node with node value <u>text</u>, appends it to the hidden  fragment  list
              in  the  document  object and returns the node object.  If <u>objVar</u> is given, the new node object is
              stored in this variable.

       <b>createComment</b> <u>text</u> <b>?</b><u>objVar</u><b>?</b>
              Creates (allocates) a new comment node with value <u>text</u>, appends it to the hidden fragment list  in
              the  document object and returns the node object.  If <u>objVar</u> is given, the new comment node object
              is stored in this variable.

       <b>createCDATASection</b> <u>data</u> <b>?</b><u>objVar</u><b>?</b>
              Creates (allocates) a new CDATA node with node value <u>data</u>, appends it to the hidden fragment  list
              in  the  document  object and returns the node object.  If <u>objVar</u> is given, the new node object is
              stored in this variable.

       <b>createProcessingInstruction</b> <u>target</u> <u>data</u> <b>?</b><u>objVar</u><b>?</b>
              Creates a process instruction, appends it to the hidden fragment list in the document  object  and
              returns the node object.  If <u>objVar</u> is given, the new node object is stored in this variable.

       <b>delete</b> Explicitly  deletes  the  document,  including  the  associated  Tcl  object  commands (for nodes,
              fragment/new nodes, the document object itself) and the underlying DOM tree.

       <b>getDefaultOutputMethod</b>
              Returns the default  output  method  of  the  document.  This  is  usually  a  result  of  a  XSLT
              transformation.

       <b>asXML</b> <b>?-indent</b> <b>none/tabs/1..8?</b> <b>?-channel</b> <b>channelId?</b> <b>?-escapeNonASCII?</b> <b>?-doctypeDeclaration</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;?</b>
       <b>-xmlDeclaration</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;?</b> <b>-encString</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> <b>?-escapeAllQuot?</b> <b>?-indentAttrs?</b> <b>?-nogtescape?</b>
       <b>?-noEmptyElementTag?</b> <b>?-escapeCR?</b> <b>?-escapeTab?</b>

              Returns  the  DOM  tree  as  an (optional indented) XML string or sends the output directly to the
              given channelId.

              The -indent option requires "no", "none", "tabs" or  a  natural  number  betwenn  0  and  8,  both
              included,  as  value.  With  the values "no" or "none" no additional white space outside of markup
              will be added to the serialization. I. Otherwise, it's  a  "pretty-print"  serialization,  due  to
              inserting white space between end and the next start tag according to the nesting level. The level
              indentation  wide  is given with the number. If the value is "tabs", then indentation is done with
              tabs, one tab per level.

              If the option <u>-escapeNonASCII</u> is given, every non 7 bit ASCII character  in  attribute  values  or
              element PCDATA content will be escaped as character reference in decimal representation.

              The flag <u>-doctypeDeclaration</u> determines whether there will be a DOCTYPE declaration emitted before
              the first node of the document. The default is not to emit it. The DOCTYPE name will always be the
              element  name  of  the  document element. An external entity declaration of the external subset is
              only emitted if the document has a system identifier.

              The flag <u>-xmlDeclaration</u> determines whether there will be an XML Declaration and a newline emitted
              before anything else. The default is not to emit one. If this flag is given with a  true  argument
              then

              <u>-encString</u>  sets  the  encoding  value  in  the XML Declaration. Otherwise this option is ignored.
              Please note that this option  just  enhances  the  string  representation  of  the  generated  XML
              Declaration  with  an  encoding  information  string,  nothing more. It's up to the user to handle
              encoding in case of writing to a channel or reparsing.

              If the option <u>-escapeAllQuot</u> is given, quotation marks will be escaped with &amp;quot;  even  in  text
              content of elements.

              If  the  option  <u>-indentAttrs</u>  is  given, then attributes will each be separated with newlines and
              indented to the same level as the parent node plus the value given  as  argument  to  <u>-indentAttrs</u>
              (0..8).

              If  the  option  <u>-nogtescape</u> is given then the character '&gt;' won't get escaped in attribute values
              and text content of elements. The default is to escape this character.

              If the option <u>-noEmptyElementTag</u> is given then no empty tag syntax will be used.  Instead,  if  an
              element  has  empty  content  it  will  be serialized with an element start tag and an immediately
              following element end tag.

              If the option <u>-escapeCR</u> is given then the character '\r' will be escaped as character reference in
              attribute values and text content of elements. The default is to not do this.

              If the option <u>-escapeTab</u> is given then the character '\t' will be escaped as  character  reference
              in attribute values and text content of elements. The default is to not do this.

       <b>asCanonicalXML</b> <b>?-channel</b> <b>channelId?</b> <b>?-comments</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;?</b>

              Returns  the  DOM  tree  as  canonical  XML string according to the "Canonical XML Version 1.0 W3C
              Recommendation 15 March 2001" or sends the output directly to the given channelId.

              If the goal is to get a canonical XML serialization of the XML file from which the  DOM  tree  was
              parsed there are a few prerequisites. The XML data must be parsed with the <u>-keepEmpties</u> option. If
              the  XML data includes a DTD which defines attribute defaults or external parsed entity references
              it is necessary to use the expat parser (not the <u>-simple</u>  one).  For  any  supported  Tcl  version
              lesser  then  9.0 if the XML data includes characters outside the BMP a Tcl build with TCL_UTF_MAX
              defined to 6 (and a tDOM build with this Tcl) is necessary.

              If the -channel option is given then the output is send directly  to  the  Tcl  channel  given  as
              argument.  It is the up to the caller to ensure that the channel is correctly fconfigured. If this
              option is not given then the command returns the serialization as string.

              If the option <u>-comments</u> is given with a  true  value  then  the  serialization  includes  comments
              according to the rules of the recommendation. If the value is false or this option is omitted then
              comments are removed from the serialization.

       <b>asHTML</b> <b>?-channel</b> <b>channelId?</b> <b>?-escapeNonASCII?</b> <b>?-htmlEntities?</b> <b>?-doctypeDeclaration</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;?</b>
       <b>?-breakLines?</b> <b>?-onlyContents?</b>

              Returns  the  DOM tree serialized according to HTML rules (HTML elements are recognized regardless
              of case, without end tags for empty HTML elements etc.) as string or sends the output directly  to
              the given channelId.

              If  the  option  <u>-escapeNonASCII</u>  is given, every non 7 bit ASCII character in attribute values or
              element PCDATA content will be escaped as character reference in decimal representation.

              If the option <u>-htmlEntities</u> is given, a character or a pair of characters  is  written  using  its
              HTML  5  character entity reference, if it has one. Some HTML 5 character entity references encode
              the same character or code points. From the possible entity names  the  shortest  is  choosen.  If
              there  are  more  than  one  shortest  name  and this names differ only in case then the lowercase
              alternative is choosen. Otherwise frist name in lexical ASCII order is choosen. There is one HTML5
              entitiy (ThickSpace), which escapes two characters for which the first and  the  second  character
              have  an  entity  name  by  itself.  If  the two characters are to be serialized then the one two-
              characters entity ThickSpace will be choosen.

              If the option <u>-breakLines</u> is given the serialization outputs "\n&gt;" instead of "&gt;" for the  opening
              tags of elements.

              If  the  option <u>-onlyContents</u> is given only all child nodes are serialized. This option is ignored
              by document nodes.

              If the flag <u>-doctypeDeclaration</u> is given there will be a DOCTYPE declaration  emitted  before  the
              first node of the document. The default is, to do not. The DOCTYPE name will always be the element
              name  of  the  document  element without case normalization. An external entity declaration of the
              external subset is only emitted, if the document has a system identifier. The doctype  declaration
              will  be  written  from  the  available  information, without check, if this is a known (w3c) HTML
              version information or if the document confirms to the given HTML version. All nodes  types  other
              than document nodes ignore this option.

       <b>asText</b> The  asText method returns the tree by serializing the string-value of every text node in document
              order without any escaping. In effect, this is what  the  xslt  output  method  "text"  (XSLT  1.0
              recommendation, section 16.3) does.

       <b>asJSON</b> <b>?-indent</b> <b>none/0..8?</b> <b>?-channel</b> <b>channelId?</b>

              The  asJSON  method  serializes  the tree into a valid JSON data string. In general, this may be a
              lossy serialization. For this serialization all comment, character data  sections  and  processing
              instruction  nodes, all attributes and all XML namespaces are ignored. Only element and text nodes
              may be reflected in the generated JSON serialization. Appropriate JSON data type information of  a
              node will be respected.

              If an element node has the JSON type OBJECT, then every element node child of this element will be
              serialized  as  member  of that object, with the node name of the child as the member name and the
              relevant children of that child as the value. Every other child nodes will be ignored.

              If an element node has the JSON type ARRAY, then the  text  and  element  node  children  of  that
              element  node  are  serialized as the consecutive values of the array. Element node children of an
              ARRAY element will be container nodes for nested ARRAY or OBJECT values.

              Text nodes with the JSON types TRUE, FALSE or NULL will be serialized to  the  corresponding  JSON
              token  without looking at the value of the text node. A text node without JSON type will always be
              serialized as a JSON string token.  A text node with JSON type NUMBER will be serialized  as  JSON
              number token if the text node value is in fact a valid JSON number and as a JSON string if not.

              If an element node doesn't has a JSON type then the serialization of its children is determined by
              the following rules:

              Only text and element node child are relevant. If the element node to serialize is the member of a
              JSON  object  and  there  is no relevant child node the value of that member will be an empty JSON
              string. If the only relevant child node of this element node is a text node then the JSON value of
              that text node will be the value of the object member. If the element has more than  one  relevant
              child nodes and the first one is a text node then the relevant children will be serialized as JSON
              array.  If  the  only  relevant  child  node  is an element node or the first relevant child is an
              element node and the node name of that only or first relevant  child  isn't  equal  to  the  array
              container  node  name all element node children will be serialized as the members of a JSON object
              (while ignoring any intermixed text nodes). If the only or first relevant child is an element node
              and the node name of this child is equal to the array container element  name  then  all  relevant
              children will be serialized as the values of a JSON array.

              If  the  element  to  serialize is a value of a JSON array and the node name of this element isn't
              equal to the array container node name that element will be seen as a container node  for  a  JSON
              object  and  all  element  node  children  will  be  serialized as the members of that array while
              ignoring any text node children. If the element to serialize is a value of a JSON  array  and  the
              node name of this element is equal to the array container node name, all relevant children will be
              serialized as JSON array.

              If  the  <u>-channel</u>  option is given the serialization isn't returned as string but send directly to
              the channel, given as argument to the option.

              If the <u>-indent</u> option is given and the argument  given  to  this  option  isn't  "none"  then  the
              returned  JSON  string is "pretty-printed". The numeric argument to this option defines the number
              of spaces for any indentation level. The default is to not emit any additional white space.

       <b>asTclValue</b> <b>?typevariable?</b>

              In case the DOM tree includes JSON type information this method returns the JSON  data  as  nested
              Tcl data structure.

              The  returned  value  may  be  a  Tcl  dict,  a  Tcl  list  or  a string. If the optional argument
              <u>typevariable</u> is given then the variable with that name is set to the value <u>dict</u>,  <u>list</u>  or  <u>string</u>
              respectively to signal the type of the result.

              A  JSON  object  is  returned  as  Tcl dict, a JSON array is returned as list and JSON strings and
              numbers as well as the symbolic JSON values null, true and false are returned as string (with  the
              strings  null,  true  and false for the respectively JSON symbol). The value of a member of a JSON
              object may be also a Tcl dict, or a Tcl list or a string and the elements of a JSON array list may
              be a Tcl dict or a Tcl list or a string.

       <b>asTypedList</b>

              In case the DOM tree includes JSON type information this method returns the JSON data as a  nested
              Tcl list.

              The  first  element of every of this lists describes the type of the value. The types are: OBJECT,
              ARRAY, STRING, NUMBER, TRUE, FALSE or NULL.

              If the type is NUMBER or STRING, then the second (and last) element is the value. If the  type  is
              NULL, TRUE or FALSE the list does not have any other elements.

              If  the type is OBJECT the second value will be a Tcl list of property name and value pairs, which
              means the second element could be used as dict. The value will be a Tcl list build by the rules of
              the <u>asTypedList</u> method.

              If the type is ARRAY the second value will be a Tcl list of the JSON array values, each one  build
              by the rules of the <u>asTypedList</u> method.

       <b>publicId</b> <u>?publicId?</u>
              Returns  the  public  identifier  of  the  doctype  declaration  of the document, if there is one,
              otherwise the empty string. If there is a value given to the method, the public identifier of  the
              document is set to this value.

       <b>systemId</b> <u>?systemId?</u>
              Returns  the  system  identifier  of  the  doctype  declaration  of the document, if there is one,
              otherwise the empty string. If there is a value given to the method, the system identifier of  the
              document is set to this value.

       <b>internalSubset</b> <u>?internalSubset?</u>
              Returns the internal subset of the doctype declaration of the document, if there is one, otherwise
              the  empty string. If there is a value given to the method, the internal subset of the document is
              set to this value. Note that none of the  parsing  methods  preserve  the  internal  subset  of  a
              document;  a freshly parsed document will always have an empty internal subset. Also note that the
              method doesn't do any syntactical check on a given internal subset.

       <b>cdataSectionElements</b> <u>(?URI:?localname|*)</u> <u>?&lt;boolean&gt;?</u>
              This method allows one to control  for  which  element  nodes  the  text  node  children  will  be
              serialized  as CDATA sections (this affects only serialization with the asXML method, no text node
              is altered in any way by this method). IF the method is called  with  an  element  name  as  first
              argument  and a boolean with value true as second argument, every text node child of every element
              node in the document with the same name as the first argument will be serialized as CDATA section.
              If the second argument is a boolean with value false, all text nodes of all elements with the same
              name as the first argument will be serialized as usual. Namespaced element names have to be  given
              in  the  form  namespace_URI:localname, not in the otherwise usual prefix:localname form. With two
              arguments called, the method returns the used boolean value. If the method is called with only  an
              element  name,  it  will  return  a  boolean  value, indicating that the text node children of all
              elements with that name in the document will be serialized as CDATA section elements (return value
              1) or not (return value 0). If the method is called with only one argument and that argument is an
              asterisk ('*'), then the method returns an unordered list of all element names  of  the  document,
              for which the text node children will be serialized as CDATA section nodes.

       <b>selectNodesNamespaces</b> <b>?prefixUriList?</b>
              This method gives control to a document global prefix to namespace URI mapping, which will be used
              for  selectNodes method calls (on document as well as on all nodes, which belongs to the document)
              if it is not overwritten by using the -namespaces option of the selectNodes method. Any  namespace
              prefix  within an xpath expression will be first resolved against this list. If the list binds the
              same prefix to different namespaces, then the first binding  will  win.  If  a  prefix  could  not
              resolved  against  the document global prefix / namespaces list, then the namespace definitions in
              scope of the context node will be used to resolve the prefix, as usual.  If the optional  argument
              <u>prefixUriList</u>  is  given,  then the global prefix / namespace list is set to this list and returns
              it. Without the optional argument the method returns the current list. The default  is  the  empty
              list.

       <b>xslt</b> <b>?-parameters</b> <b>parameterList?</b> <b>?-ignoreUndeclaredParameters?</b> <b>?-maxApplyDepth</b> <b>int?</b> <b>?-xsltmessagecmd</b>
       <b>script?</b> <u>stylesheet</u> <u>?outputVar?</u>
              Applies  an XSLT transformation on the whole document of the node object using the XSLT <u>stylesheet</u>
              (given as domDoc). Returns a document object containing the result document of the  transformation
              and stores that document object in the optional <u>outputVar</u>, if that was given.

              The optional <u>-parameters</u> option sets top level &lt;xsl:param&gt; to string values. The <u>parameterList</u> has
              to be a tcl list consisting of parameter name and value pairs.

              If  the  option  <u>-ignoreUndeclaredParameters</u>  is  given, then parameter names in the <u>parameterList</u>
              given to the <u>-parameters</u> options that are not declared as top-level parameters in  the  stylesheet
              are silently ignored. Without this option, an error is raised if the user tries to set a top-level
              parameter that is not declared in the stylesheet.

              The  option  <u>-maxApplyDepth</u>  expects  a  positiv  integer as argument. By default, the XSLT engine
              allows XSLT templates to nest up to 3000 levels (and raises error if they nest deeper). This limit
              can be set by the <u>-maxApplyDepth</u> option.

              The <u>-xsltmessagecmd</u> option sets a callback for xslt:message elements in the stylesheet. The actual
              command consists of the script, given as argument to the option, appended with  the  XML  Fragment
              from  instantiating  the  xsl:message element content as string (as if the XPath string() function
              would have been applied to the XML Fragment) and a flag, which indicates, if the  xsl:message  has
              an  attribute  "terminate"  with  the value "yes". If the called script returns anything else then
              TCL_OK then the XSLT transformation will be aborted, returning error. If the called script returns
              -code break, the error message is empty, otherwise  the  result  code  is  reported.  In  case  of
              terminated transformation, the outputVar, if given, is set to the empty string.

       <b>toXSLTcmd</b> <b>?</b><u>objVar</u><b>?</b>
              If  the  DOM  tree represents a valid XSLT stylesheet, this method transforms the DOM tree into an
              XSLT command, otherwise it returns error. The created  xsltCmd  is  returned  and  stored  in  the
              <u>objVar</u>, if a var name was given. A successful transformation of the DOM tree to an xsltCmd removes
              the domDoc cmd and all nodeCmds of the document.

              The syntax of the created xsltCmd is:

                     <b>xsltCmd</b> <b>method</b> <b>?arg</b> <b>...?</b>

              The valid methods are:

              <b>transform</b> <b>?-parameters</b> <b>parameterList?</b> <b>?-ignoreUndeclaredParameters?</b> <b>?-maxApplyDepth</b> <b>int?</b>
              <b>?-xsltmessagecmd</b> <b>script?</b> <u>domDoc</u> <u>?outputVar?</u>
                     Applies  XSLT  transformation  on the document <u>domDoc</u>. Returns a document object containing
                     the result document of that transformation and stores it in the optional <u>outputVar</u>.

                     The  optional  <u>-parameters</u>  option  sets  top  level  &lt;xsl:param&gt;  to  string  values.  The
                     <u>parameterList</u> has to be a tcl list consisting of parameter name and value pairs.

                     If   the   option  <u>-ignoreUndeclaredParameters</u>  is  given,  then  parameter  names  in  the
                     <u>parameterList</u> given  to  the  <u>-parameters</u>  options  that  are  not  declared  as  top-level
                     parameters  in the stylesheet are silently ignored. Without this option, an error is raised
                     if the user tries to set a top-level parameter, which is not declared in the stylesheet.

                     The option <u>-maxApplyDepth</u> expects a positiv integer  as  argument.  By  default,  the  XSLT
                     engine  allows  XSLT  templates  to  nest  up to 3000 levels (and raises error if they nest
                     deeper). This limit can be set by the <u>-maxApplyDepth</u> option.

                     The <u>-xsltmessagecmd</u> option sets a callback for xslt:message elements in the stylesheet. The
                     actual command consists of the script, given as argument to the option, appended  with  the
                     XML  Fragment from instantiating the xsl:message element content as string (as if the XPath
                     string() function would have been applied to the XML Fragment) and a flag, which indicates,
                     if the xsl:message has an attribute "terminate" with the value "yes".

              <b>delete</b> Deletes the xsltCmd and cleans up all used recourses

              If the first argument to an xsltCmd is a domDoc  or  starts  with  a  "-",  then  the  command  is
              processed in the same way as <u>&lt;xsltCmd&gt;</u> <u>transform</u>.

       <b>normalize</b> <u>?-forXPath?</u>
              Puts  all  text  nodes  in the document into a "normal" form where only structure (e.g., elements,
              comments, processing instructions and CDATA  sections)  separates  text  nodes,  i.e.,  there  are
              neither  adjacent  text  nodes  nor  empty text nodes. If the option <u>-forXPath</u> is given, all CDATA
              sections in the nodes are converted to text nodes, as a first step before the normalization.

       <b>nodeType</b>
              Returns the node type of the document node. This is always DOCUMENT_NODE.

       <b>getElementById</b> <u>id</u>
              Returns the node having a id attribute with value <u>id</u> or the empty string, if no  node  has  an  id
              attribute with that value.

       <b>firstChild</b> <b>?objVar?</b>
              Returns the first top level node of the document.

       <b>lastChild</b> <b>?objVar?</b>
              Returns the last top level node of the document.

       <b>appendChild</b> <u>newChild</u>
              Append <u>newChild</u> to the end of the list of top level nodes of the document.

       <b>removeChild</b> <u>child</u>
              Removes <u>child</u> from the list of top level nodes of the document. <u>child</u> will be part of the document
              fragment list after this operation. It is not physically deleted.

       <b>hasChildNodes</b>
              Returns 1 if the document has any nodes in the tree. Otherwise 0 is returned.

       <b>childNodes</b>
              Returns a list of the top level nodes of the document.

       <b>ownerDocument</b> <b>?domObjVar?</b>
              Returns the document itself.

       <b>insertBefore</b> <u>newChild</u>  <u>refChild</u>
              Insert  <u>newChild</u> before the <u>refChild</u> into the list of top level nodes of the document. If <u>refChild</u>
              is the empty string, inserts <u>newChild</u> at the end of the top level nodes.

       <b>replaceChild</b> <u>newChild</u>  <u>oldChild</u>
              Replaces <u>oldChild</u> with <u>newChild</u> in the list of children of that node. The <u>oldChild</u>  node  will  be
              part of the document fragment list after this operation.

       <b>appendFromList</b> <u>list</u>
              Parses  <u>list</u> , creates an according DOM subtree and appends this subtree at the end of the current
              list of top level nodes of the document.

       <b>appendXML</b> <u>XMLstring</u>
              Parses <u>XMLstring</u>, creates an according DOM subtree and appends this subtree  at  the  end  of  the
              current list of top level nodes of the document.

       <b>selectNodes</b> <b>?-namespaces</b> <b>prefixUriList?</b> <b>?-cache</b> <b>&lt;boolean&gt;?</b> <b>?-list?</b> <u>xpathQuery</u> <b>?typeVar?</b>

              Returns the result of applying the XPath query <u>xpathQuery</u> to the document. The context node of the
              query  is  the  root node in the sense of the XPath recommendation (not the document element). The
              result can be a string/value, a list of strings, a list of nodes or a list  of  attribute  name  /
              value  pairs.  If <u>typeVar</u> is given the result type name is stored into that variable (empty, bool,
              number, string, nodes, attrnodes or mixed).

              See the documentation of the of the

              <b>domNode</b>
                      command method <b>selectNodes</b> for a detailed description of the arguments.

       <b>baseURI</b> <u>?URI?</u>
              Returns the present baseURI of the document. If the optional argument URI is given, sets the  base
              URI of the document to the given URI.

       <b>appendFromScript</b> <u>tclScript</u>
              Appends  the  nodes  created  by  the  <u>tclScript</u> by Tcl functions, which have been built using <u>dom</u>
              <u>createNodeCmd</u>, at the end of the current list of top level nodes of the document.

       <b>insertBeforeFromScript</b> <u>tclScript</u> <u>refChild</u>
              Inserts the nodes created in the <u>tclScript</u> by Tcl functions,  which  have  been  built  using  <u>dom</u>
              <u>createNodeCmd</u>,  before  the  <u>refChild</u>  into  to  the  list  of top level nodes of the document. If
              <u>refChild</u> is the empty string, the new nodes will be appended.

       <b>deleteXPathCache</b> <u>?xpathQuery?</u>
              If called without the optional argument, all cached XPath expressions of the document  are  freed.
              If  called with the optional argument <u>xpathQuery</u>, this single XPath query will be removed from the
              cache, if it is there. The method always returns an empty string.

       Otherwise, if an unknown method name is given, the command with the same name as the given method  within
       the namespace <b>::dom::domDoc</b> is tried to be executed. This allows quick method additions on Tcl level.

       Newly  created nodes are appended to a hidden fragment list. If they are not moved into the tree they are
       automatically deleted as soon as the whole document gets deleted.
