</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       RTF::Document - Perl extension for generating Rich Text (RTF) Files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       RTF::Document is a module for generating Rich Text Format (RTF) documents that can be used by most text
       converters and word processors.

       For a listing of properties, consult the %DOCINFO and %PROPERTIES hashes in the source code.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIRED</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
           Carp
           POSIX
           Convert::Units::Type 0.33

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
           use RTF::Document;

           # Document properties

           $rtf = new RTF::Document(
             {
               doc_page_width =&gt; '8.5in',
               doc_page_height =&gt; '11in'
             }
           );

           # Font definitions

           $fAvantGarde = $rtf-&gt;add_font ("AvantGarde",
              { family=&gt;swiss,
                default=&gt;1
              } );
           $fCourier = $rtf-&gt;add_font ("Courier",
             { family=&gt;monospace, pitch=&gt;fixed,
               alternates=&gt;["Courier New", "American Typewriter"]
             } );

           # Color definitions

           $cRed   = $rtf-&gt;add_color ( { red=&gt;255 } );
           $cGreen = $rtf-&gt;add_color ( { green=&gt;128 } );
           $cCustm = $rtf-&gt;add_color ( { red=&gt;0x66, blue=&gt;0x33, green=&gt;0x33 } );

           $cBlack = $rtf-&gt;add_color ( { name=&gt;'black' } );
           $cWhite = $rtf-&gt;add_color ( { gray=&gt;'100%' } );

           $cNavy = $rtf-&gt;add_color ( { blue=&gt;'100%', gray=&gt;'50%' } );

           # style definitions

           $sNormal = $rtf-&gt;add_style( "Normal",
             { font=&gt;$fAvantGarde, font_size=&gt;'12pt',
               color_foreground=&gt;$cBlack },
             { type=&gt;paragraph, default=&gt;1 }
           );

           $sGreen = $rtf-&gt;add_style( "Green",
             { color_foreground=&gt;$cGreen },
             { type=&gt;character, additive=&gt;1 }
           );

           # Mix any combo of properties and text...

           $rtf-&gt;add_text( $rtf-&gt;root(),
              "Default text\n\n",

              { bold=&gt;1, underline=&gt;continuous },
              "Bold/Underlined Text\n\n",

              { font_size=&gt;'20pt', font=&gt;$fCourier,
                color_foreground=&gt;$cRed },
              "Bigger, Red and Monospaced.\n\n",

              { style_default=&gt;paragraph },
              { style_default=&gt;character },

              "This is ",
              [ { style=&gt;$sGreen }, "green" ],
              " styled.\n\n"

           );

           open FILE, "&gt;MyFile.rtf";
           binmode FILE;
           print FILE $rtf-&gt;rtf();
           close FILE;

</pre><h4><b>DOCUMENT</b> <b>STRUCTURE</b></h4><pre>
       For purposes of using this module, a Rich Text (RTF) Document can be subdivided into <u>groups</u>. Groups can
       be considered containers for <u>text</u> and <u>controls</u> (controlling document and text properties).

       For all intents and purposes, a group limits the scope of controls. So if we set the "bold" character
       property within a group, the text will be bold only within that group (until it is turned off within that
       group).

       When generating a RTF document using this module, we are only concerned with the <u>root</u> group (also called
       the "Document Area"). (The "Header" groups are taken care of automatically by this module.)

       The Document Area is subdivided into <u>sections</u>. Each section is subdivided into <u>paragraphs</u>.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Some of the methods are documented below. (Methods not documented here may be changed in future
       versions.)

   <b>new</b>
           $rtf = new RTF::Document( \%DocumentProperties );

       Creates a new RTF document object.

   <b>root</b>
           $gRoot = $rtf-&gt;root();

       Returns the "root" group in the RTF document.

   <b>new_group</b>
           $gMyGroup = $rtf-&gt;new_group();

       Creates a new group (not inside of the RTF document).

   <b>add_group</b>
           $gChildOfRoot = $rtf-&gt;add_group();
           $gChildOfChild = $rtf-&gt;add_group( $gChild );

       Adds a child group to the specfied group. If no group is specified, the "root" group is assumed.

           $rtf-&gt;add_group( $rtf-&gt;root(), $gMyGroup );

       Adds a group to the specified parent group (in this case, the root group).

   <b>add_raw</b>
           $rtf-&gt;add_raw( $group, '\par', "Some Text" );

       Adds raw controls and text to the group. This method is intended for internal use only.

   <b>add_text</b>
           $rtf-&gt;add_text( $group, "Some text ", { bold=&gt;1 }, "more text" );

       Adds text and controls to a group. Text is escaped.

   <b>add_font</b>
   <b>add_color</b>
   <b>add_style</b>
</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Document</b> <b>Properties</b>
   <b>Section</b> <b>Properties</b>
   <b>Paragraph</b> <b>Properties</b>
   <b>Character</b> <b>Properties</b>
</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       This module should be considered in the "alpha" stage. Use at your own risk.

       There are no default document or style properties produced by this module, with the exception of the
       character set. If you want to make sure that a <u>specific</u> font, color, or style is used, you must specify
       it. Otherwise you rely on the assumptions of whatever RTF reader someone is using.

       This module does not insert newlines anywhere in the text, even though some RTF writers break lines
       before they exceed 225 characters.  This may or may not be an issue with some reader software.

       Unknown font or style properties will generally be ignored without warning.

       This module supports some newer RTF controls (used in Word 95/Word 97) that may are not understood by
       older RTF readers.

       Once a Font, Color or Style is added, it cannot be changed. No checking for redundant entries is done.

       Generally, it is not possible to reference a not-yet-created Style with the next or basedon attributes.
       However, you can use the constances "last", "self" or "next" to reference the last style added, the
       current style being added, or the next style that will be added, respectively.

       Specifying properties in a particular order within a group does not guarantee that they will be emitted
       in that order. If order matters, specify them separetly. For instance,

           $rtf-&gt;add_text($rtf-&gt;root, { style_default=&gt;character, bold=&gt;1 } );

       should be (if you want to ensure character styles are reset before setting bold text):

           $rtf-&gt;add_text($rtf-&gt;root, { style_default=&gt;character }, { bold=&gt;1 } );

       Also note that duplicate properties within the same group won't work. i.e., If you want to set
       "style_default" for both paragraphs and characters, you must do so in separate groups.

       This isn't so much as a bug as the way Perl handles hashes.

   <b>Unimplemented</b> <b>Features</b>
       A rather large number of features and control words are not handled in this version. Among the major
       features:

       Annotations and Comments
       Bookmarks
       Bullets and Paragraph Numbering
           Some  support  has  been  added. The backwards-compatability controls for numbered paragraphs used by
           older readers has not been added because it is not properly handled by newer readers.

       Character Sets and Internationalization
           Non-"ANSI" character sets (i.e., Macintosh) and Unicode character sets are not  supported  (at  least
           not intentionally). There is no support for Asian character sets in this version of the module.

           Unicode character escapes are not implemented.

           Language  codes  (defining  a  default  language,  or  a  language for a group of characters) are not
           implemented.

           Bi-directional and text-flow controls are not implemented.

       Embedded Images and OLE Objects
       File Tables
       Footnotes and Endnotes
       Forms
       Headers and Footers
       Hyphenation Control
           Some minimal controls have been added.

       Lists and List Tables
           Not implemented: List Tables are really a kind of style sheet for lists.  Priority will be  given  to
           support generic bullets and paragraph numbering.

       Page Numbering
           Minimal definition, untested.

       Printer Bin Controls
       Revision Tables
       Special Characters and Document Variables
           Most  special  characters  not not implemented, with the exception of tabs. Double newline characters
           are converted to a new paragraph control, and single newlines are converted to a new line control.

       Tabs
       Tables and Frames
