</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Elemental::PerlMunger - a thing that takes a string of Perl and rewrites its documentation

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.200007

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       This role is to be included in classes that rewrite the documentation of a Perl document, stripping out
       all the Pod, munging it, and replacing it into the Perl.

       The only relevant method is "munge_perl_string", which must be implemented with a different interface
       than will be exposed.

       When calling the "munge_perl_string" method, arguments should be passed like this:

         $object-&gt;munge_perl_string($perl_string, \%arg);

       $perl_string should be a character string containing Perl source code.

       %arg may contain any input for the underlying procedure.  Defined keys for %arg are:

       filename
           the name of the file whose contents are being munged; optional, used for error messages

       no_strip_bom
           If  given,  the BOM character (U+FEFF) won't be stripped from the input.  Probably best to leave this
           one off.

       The method will return a character string containing the rewritten and combined document.

       Classes including this role must implement a "munge_perl_string" that expects to be called like this:

         $object-&gt;munge_perl_string(\%doc, \%arg);

       %doc will have two entries:

         ppi - a PPI::Document of the Perl document with all its Pod removed
         pod - a Pod::Elemental::Document with no transformations yet performed

       This "munge_perl_string" method should return a hashref in the same format as %doc.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any  version  of  perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although  it  may  work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>replacer</b>
       The replacer is either a method name or code reference used to produces  PPI  elements  used  to  replace
       removed  Pod.   By  default,  it is "replace_with_nothing", which just removes Pod tokens entirely.  This
       means that the line numbers of the code in the newly-produced document are changed, if the Pod  had  been
       interleaved with the code.

       See also "replace_with_comment" and "replace_with_blank".

       If no further code follows the Pod being replaced, "post_code_replacer" is used instead.

   <b>post_code_replacer</b>
       This  attribute  is  used  just  like  "replacer",  and  defaults  to its value, but is used for building
       replacements for Pod removed after the last hunk of code.  The idea is  that  if  you're  only  concerned
       about  altering  your  code's line numbers, you can stop replacing stuff after there's no more code to be
       affected.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>replace_with_nothing</b>
       This method returns nothing.  It's the default "replacer".  It's not very interesting.

   <b>replace_with_comment</b>
       This replacer replaces removed Pod elements with a comment containing their text.  In other words:

         =head1 A header!

         This is great!

         =cut

       ...is replaced with:

         # =head1 A header!
         #
         # This is great!
         #
         # =cut

   <b>replace_with_blank</b>
       This replacer replaces removed Pod elements with vertical whitespace  of  equal  line  count.   In  other
       words:

         =head1 A header!

         This is great!

         =cut

       ...is replaced with five blank lines.
