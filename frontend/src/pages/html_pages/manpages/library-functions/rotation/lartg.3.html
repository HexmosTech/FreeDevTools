   <b>subroutine</b> <b>clartg</b> <b>(complex(wp)</b> <b>f,</b> <b>complex(wp)</b> <b>g,</b> <b>real(wp)</b> <b>c,</b> <b>complex(wp)</b> <b>s,</b> <b>complex(wp)</b> <b>r)</b>
       <b>CLARTG</b> generates a plane rotation with real cosine and complex sine.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CLARTG generates a plane rotation so that

               [  C         S  ] . [ F ]  =  [ R ]
               [ -conjg(S)  C  ]   [ G ]     [ 0 ]

            where C is real and C**2 + |S|**2 = 1.

            The mathematical formulas used for C and S are

               sgn(x) = {  x / |x|,   x != 0
                        {  1,         x  = 0

               R = sgn(F) * sqrt(|F|**2 + |G|**2)

               C = |F| / sqrt(|F|**2 + |G|**2)

               S = sgn(F) * conjg(G) / sqrt(|F|**2 + |G|**2)

            Special conditions:
               If G=0, then C=1 and S=0.
               If F=0, then C=0 and S is chosen so that R is real.

            When F and G are real, the formulas simplify to C = F/R and
            S = G/R, and the returned values of C, S, and R should be
            identical to those returned by SLARTG.

            The algorithm used to compute these quantities incorporates scaling
            to avoid overflow or underflow in computing the square root of the
            sum of squares.

            This is the same routine CROTG fom BLAS1, except that
            F and G are unchanged on return.

            Below, wp=&gt;sp stands for single precision from LA_CONSTANTS module.

   <b>subroutine</b> <b>dlartg</b> <b>(real(wp)</b> <b>f,</b> <b>real(wp)</b> <b>g,</b> <b>real(wp)</b> <b>c,</b> <b>real(wp)</b> <b>s,</b> <b>real(wp)</b> <b>r)</b>
       <b>DLARTG</b> generates a plane rotation with real cosine and real sine.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DLARTG generates a plane rotation so that

               [  C  S  ]  .  [ F ]  =  [ R ]
               [ -S  C  ]     [ G ]     [ 0 ]

            where C**2 + S**2 = 1.

            The mathematical formulas used for C and S are
               R = sign(F) * sqrt(F**2 + G**2)
               C = F / R
               S = G / R
            Hence C &gt;= 0. The algorithm used to compute these quantities
            incorporates scaling to avoid overflow or underflow in computing the
            square root of the sum of squares.

            This version is discontinuous in R at F = 0 but it returns the same
            C and S as ZLARTG for complex inputs (F,0) and (G,0).

            This is a more accurate version of the BLAS1 routine DROTG,
            with the following other differences:
               F and G are unchanged on return.
               If G=0, then C=1 and S=0.
               If F=0 and (G .ne. 0), then C=0 and S=sign(1,G) without doing any
                  floating point operations (saves work in DBDSQR when
                  there are zeros on the diagonal).

            Below, wp=&gt;dp stands for double precision from LA_CONSTANTS module.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>F</u>

                     F is REAL(wp)
                     The first component of vector to be rotated.

                     G is REAL(wp)

           <u>C</u>

                     C is REAL(wp)

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            The mathematical formulas used for C and S are

                        {  1,         x  = 0

               If F=0, then C=0 and S is chosen so that R is real.

            When F and G are real, the formulas simplify to C = F/R and
            S = G/R, and the returned values of C, S, and R should be
