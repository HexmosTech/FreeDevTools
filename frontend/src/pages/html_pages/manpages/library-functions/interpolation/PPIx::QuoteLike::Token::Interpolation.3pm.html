</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PPIx::QuoteLike::Token::Interpolation - Represent an interpolation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This class should not be instantiated by the user. See below for public methods.

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
       "PPIx::QuoteLike::Token::Interpolation" is a PPIx::QuoteLike::Token.

       "PPIx::QuoteLike::Token::Interpolation" has no descendants.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This Perl class represents an interpolation into a quote-like string.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This class supports the following public methods in addition to those of its superclass:

   <b>ppi</b>
        my $ppi = $elem-&gt;ppi();

       This convenience method returns the PPI::Document representing the content. This document should be
       considered read only.  An exception will be thrown if PPI::Document can not be loaded.

       Note that the content of the returned PPI::Document may not be the same as the content of the original
       "PPIx::Regexp::Token::Interpolation". This can happen because interpolated variable names may be enclosed
       in curly brackets, but this does not happen in normal code. For example, in "/${foo}bar/", the content of
       the "PPIx::Regexp::Token::Interpolation" object will be '${foo}', but the content of the "PPI::Document"
       will be '$foo'.

   <b>variables</b>
        say "Interpolates $_" for $elem-&gt;variables();

       <b>NOTE</b> that this method is discouraged, and may well be deprecated and removed. I have two problems with
       it. The first is that it returns variable names rather than PPI::Element objects, leaving you no idea how
       the variables are used. The second is that it does not properly handle things like "${^CAPTURE[0]}", and
       it seems infeasible to make it do so. It was originally written for the benefit of
       Perl::Critic::Policy::Variables::ProhibitUnusedVarsStricter, but has proven inadequate to that policy's
       needs.

       This convenience method returns all interpolated variables. Each is returned only once, and they are
       returned in no particular order.
