       <b>CGEBAL</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CGEBAL balances a general complex matrix A.  This involves, first,
            permuting A by a similarity transformation to isolate eigenvalues
            in the first 1 to ILO-1 and last IHI+1 to N elements on the
            diagonal; and second, applying a diagonal similarity transformation
            to rows and columns ILO to IHI to make the rows and columns as
            close in norm as possible.  Both steps are optional.

            Balancing may reduce the 1-norm of the matrix, and improve the
            accuracy of the computed eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>JOB</u>

                     JOB is CHARACTER*1
                     Specifies the operations to be performed on A:
                     = 'N':  none:  simply set ILO = 1, IHI = N, SCALE(I) = 1.0
                             for i = 1,...,N;
                     = 'P':  permute only;
                     = 'S':  scale only;
                     = 'B':  both permute and scale.

                     A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the input matrix A.
                     On exit,  A is overwritten by the balanced matrix.
                     If JOB = 'N', A is not referenced.
                     See Further Details.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER

                     ILO and IHI are set to integers such that on exit
                     A(i,j) = 0 if i &gt; j and j = 1,...,ILO-1 or I = IHI+1,...,N.
                     If JOB = 'N' or 'S', ILO = 1 and IHI = N.

           <u>SCALE</u>

                     SCALE is REAL array, dimension (N)
                     Details of the permutations and scaling factors applied to

                     with row and column j and D(j) is the scaling factor
                     applied to row and column j, then
                     SCALE(j) = P(j)    for j = 1,...,ILO-1
                              = D(j)    for j = ILO,...,IHI

       <b>Further</b> <b>Details:</b>

             The permutations consist of row and column interchanges which put
             the matrix in the form

                        ( T1   X   Y  )
                P A P = (  0   B   Z  )
                        (  0   0   T2 )

             where T1 and T2 are upper triangular matrices whose eigenvalues lie
             along the diagonal.  The column indices ILO and IHI mark the starting
             and ending columns of the submatrix B. Balancing consists of applying
             a diagonal similarity transformation inv(D) * B * D to make the
             1-norms of each row of B and its corresponding column nearly equal.
             The output matrix is

                ( T1     X*D          Y    )
                (  0  inv(D)*B*D  inv(D)*Z ).
                (  0      0           T2   )

             Information about the permutations P and the diagonal matrix D is
             returned in the vector SCALE.

             This subroutine is based on the EISPACK routine CBAL.

                     JOB is CHARACTER*1
                     Specifies the operations to be performed on A:
                     = 'N':  none:  simply set ILO = 1, IHI = N, SCALE(I) = 1.0
                             for i = 1,...,N;
                     = 'P':  permute only;
                     = 'S':  scale only;
                     = 'B':  both permute and scale.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                     The order of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the input matrix A.
                     On exit,  A is overwritten by the balanced matrix.
                     If JOB = 'N', A is not referenced.
                     See Further Details.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>ILO</u>

                     ILO is INTEGER

           <u>IHI</u>

                     IHI is INTEGER
                     ILO and IHI are set to integers such that on exit
                     A(i,j) = 0 if i &gt; j and j = 1,...,ILO-1 or I = IHI+1,...,N.
                     If JOB = 'N' or 'S', ILO = 1 and IHI = N.

           <u>SCALE</u>

                     SCALE is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
                     Details of the permutations and scaling factors applied to
                     A.  If P(j) is the index of the row and column interchanged
                     with row and column j and D(j) is the scaling factor
                     applied to row and column j, then
                     SCALE(j) = P(j)    for j = 1,...,ILO-1
                              = D(j)    for j = ILO,...,IHI
                              = P(j)    for j = IHI+1,...,N.
                     The order in which the interchanges are made is N to IHI+1,
                     then 1 to ILO-1.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit.
                     &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.

       <b>Further</b> <b>Details:</b>

             The permutations consist of row and column interchanges which put
             the matrix in the form

                        ( T1   X   Y  )
                P A P = (  0   B   Z  )
                        (  0   0   T2 )

             where T1 and T2 are upper triangular matrices whose eigenvalues lie
             along the diagonal.  The column indices ILO and IHI mark the starting
             and ending columns of the submatrix B. Balancing consists of applying
             a diagonal similarity transformation inv(D) * B * D to make the
             1-norms of each row of B and its corresponding column nearly equal.
             The output matrix is

                ( T1     X*D          Y    )
                (  0  inv(D)*B*D  inv(D)*Z ).
                (  0      0           T2   )

             Information about the permutations P and the diagonal matrix D is
             returned in the vector SCALE.

             This subroutine is based on the EISPACK routine CBAL.
