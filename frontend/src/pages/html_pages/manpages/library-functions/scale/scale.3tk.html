</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-bigincrement</b>
       Database Name:  <b>bigIncrement</b>
       Database Class: <b>BigIncrement</b>

              Some  interactions  with  the  scale cause its value to change by “large” increments;  this option
              specifies the size of the large increments.  If specified as 0, the large  increments  default  to
              1/10 the range of the scale.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-command</b>
       Database Name:  <b>command</b>
       Database Class: <b>Command</b>

              Specifies the prefix of a Tcl command to invoke whenever the scale's value is changed via a widget
              command.   The  actual  command  consists  of  this  option  followed by a space and a real number
              indicating the new value of the scale.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-digits</b>
       Database Name:  <b>digits</b>
       Database Class: <b>Digits</b>

              An integer specifying how many significant digits should be retained when converting the value  of
              the scale to a string.  If the number is negative or zero, then the scale picks the smallest value
              that guarantees that every possible slider position prints as a different string.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-from</b>
       Database Name:  <b>from</b>
       Database Class: <b>From</b>

              A real value corresponding to the left or top end of the scale.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-label</b>
       Database Name:  <b>label</b>
       Database Class: <b>Label</b>

              A  string to display as a label for the scale.  For vertical scales the label is displayed just to
              the right of the top end of the scale.  For horizontal scales the label is  displayed  just  above
              the left end of the scale.  If the option is specified as an empty string, no label is displayed.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-length</b>
       Database Name:  <b>length</b>
       Database Class: <b>Length</b>

              Specifies  the  desired  long  dimension  of  the  scale  in  screen  units (i.e. any of the forms
              acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>).  For vertical scales this is  the  scale's  height;   for  horizontal
              scales it is the scale's width.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-resolution</b>
       Database Name:  <b>resolution</b>
       Database Class: <b>Resolution</b>

              A real value specifying the resolution for the scale.  If this value is greater than zero then the
              scale's  value  will always be rounded to an even multiple of this value, as will the endpoints of
              the scale.  If the value is negative then no rounding occurs.  Defaults to 1 (i.e., the value will
              be integral).

       Command-Line Name:<b>-showvalue</b>
       Database Name:  <b>showValue</b>
       Database Class: <b>ShowValue</b>

              Specifies a boolean value indicating whether or not the current  value  of  the  scale  is  to  be
              displayed.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-sliderlength</b>
       Database Name:  <b>sliderLength</b>
       Database Class: <b>SliderLength</b>

              Specifies the size of the slider, measured in screen units along the slider's long dimension.  The
              value may be specified in any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-sliderrelief</b>
       Database Name:  <b>sliderRelief</b>
       Database Class: <b>SliderRelief</b>

              Specifies the relief to use when drawing the slider, such as <b>raised</b> or <b>sunken</b>.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-state</b>
       Database Name:  <b>state</b>
       Database Class: <b>State</b>

              Specifies  one  of  three  states  for  the  scale:  <b>normal</b>, <b>active</b>, or <b>disabled</b>.  If the scale is
              disabled then the value may not be changed and the scale will  not  activate.   If  the  scale  is
              active, the slider is displayed using the color specified by the <b>-activebackground</b> option.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-tickinterval</b>
       Database Name:  <b>tickInterval</b>
       Database Class: <b>TickInterval</b>

              Must  be  a real value.  Determines the spacing between numerical tick marks displayed below or to
              the left of the slider. The values will all be displayed with the same number of  decimal  places,
              which  will  be enough to ensure they are all accurate to within 20% of a tick interval.  If 0, no
              tick marks will be displayed.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-to</b>
       Database Name:  <b>to</b>
       Database Class: <b>To</b>

              Specifies a real value corresponding to the right or bottom end of the scale.  This value  may  be
              either less than or greater than the <b>-from</b> option.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-variable</b>
       Database Name:  <b>variable</b>
       Database Class: <b>Variable</b>

              Specifies  the name of a global variable to link to the scale.  Whenever the value of the variable
              changes, the scale will  update  to  reflect  this  value.   Whenever  the  scale  is  manipulated
              interactively, the variable will be modified to reflect the scale's new value.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-width</b>
       Database Name:  <b>width</b>
       Database Class: <b>Width</b>

              Specifies  the  desired  narrow  dimension  of  the  scale  in screen units (i.e. any of the forms
              acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>).  For vertical scales this  is  the  scale's  width;   for  horizontal
              scales this is the scale's height.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>scale</b> command creates a new window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument) and makes it into a scale widget.
       Additional  options,  described  above, may be specified on the command line or in the option database to
       configure aspects of the scale such as its colors, orientation, and relief.  The  <b>scale</b>  command  returns
       its  <u>pathName</u>  argument.   At  the  time  this  command  is  invoked, there must not exist a window named
       <u>pathName</u>, but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.

       A scale is a widget that displays a rectangular <u>trough</u> and a small <u>slider</u>.  The trough corresponds  to  a
       range  of  real  values  (determined by the <b>-from</b>, <b>-to</b>, and <b>-resolution</b> options), and the position of the
       slider selects a particular real value.  The slider's position (and  hence  the  scale's  value)  may  be
       adjusted  with  the  mouse  or keyboard as described in the <b>BINDINGS</b> section below.  Whenever the scale's
       value is changed, a Tcl command is invoked (using the <b>-command</b> option) to notify other interested widgets
       of the change.  In addition, the value of the scale can be linked to a Tcl variable (using the  <b>-variable</b>
       option), so that changes in either are reflected in the other.

       Three  annotations  may be displayed in a scale widget:  a label appearing at the top right of the widget
       (top left for horizontal scales), a number displayed just to the left  of  the  slider  (just  above  the
       slider  for  horizontal scales), and a collection of numerical tick marks just to the left of the current
       value (just below the trough for horizontal scales).  Each of these three annotations may be  enabled  or
       disabled using the configuration options.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>scale</b>  command creates a new Tcl command whose name is <u>pathName</u>.  This command may be used to invoke
       various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>Option</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following commands are possible for
       scale widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the
              values accepted by the <b>scale</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u>  is  specified,  returns  a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on
              the  format  of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list
              describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist  of  the
              value  returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then
              the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given  value(s);   in  this  case  the
              command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the <b>scale</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>coords</b> ?<u>value</u>?
              Returns a list whose elements are the x and y coordinates of the point along the centerline of the
              trough that corresponds to <u>value</u>.  If <u>value</u> is omitted then the scale's current value is used.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>get</b> ?<u>x</u> <u>y</u>?
              If  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u> are omitted, returns the current value of the scale.  If <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are specified, they
              give pixel coordinates within the widget;  the command returns the scale  value  corresponding  to
              the  given  pixel.   Only  one  of  <u>x</u>  or  <u>y</u> is used:  for horizontal scales <u>y</u> is ignored, and for
              vertical scales <u>x</u> is ignored.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>identify</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
              Returns a string indicating what part of the scale lies under the coordinates given by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>.  A
              return value of <b>slider</b> means that the point is over the slider;  <b>trough1</b> means that the  point  is
              over  the  portion  of  the slider above  or to the left of the slider; and <b>trough2</b> means that the
              point is over the portion of the slider below or to the right of the slider.  If the point is  not
              over one of these elements, an empty string is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>set</b> <u>value</u>
              This  command is invoked to change the current value of the scale, and hence the position at which
              the slider is displayed.  <u>Value</u> gives the new value for the scale.  The command has no  effect  if
              the scale is disabled.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk  automatically creates class bindings for scales that give them the following default behavior.  Where
       the behavior is different for vertical and horizontal scales, the horizontal  behavior  is  described  in
       parentheses.

       [1]    If  button 1 is pressed in the trough, the scale's value will be incremented or decremented by the
              value of the <b>-resolution</b> option so that the slider moves in the direction of the cursor.   If  the
              button is held down, the action auto-repeats.

       [2]    If button 1 is pressed over the slider, the slider can be dragged with the mouse.

       [3]    If  button  1  is pressed in the trough with the Control key down, the slider moves all the way to
              the end of its range, in the direction towards the mouse cursor.

       [4]    If button 2 is pressed, the scale's value is set to the mouse position.  If the mouse  is  dragged
              with button 2 down, the scale's value changes with the drag.

       [5]    The Up and Left keys move the slider up (left) by the value of the <b>-resolution</b> option.

       [6]    The Down and Right keys move the slider down (right) by the value of the <b>-resolution</b> option.

       [7]    Control-Up and Control-Left move the slider up (left) by the value of the <b>-bigincrement</b> option.

       [8]    Control-Down  and  Control-Right  move  the  slider down (right) by the value of the <b>-bigincrement</b>
              option.

       [9]    Home moves the slider to the top (left) end of its range.

       [10]   End moves the slider to the bottom (right) end of its range.

       If the scale is disabled using the <b>-state</b> option then none of the above bindings have any effect.

       The behavior of scales can be changed by defining new bindings for individual widgets  or  by  redefining
       the class bindings.
