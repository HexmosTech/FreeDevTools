</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Name:     <b>bigIncrement</b>
       Class:    <b>BigIncrement</b>
       Switch:   <b>-bigincrement</b>
           Some  interactions  with  the  scale  cause its value to change by ``large'' increments;  this option
           specifies the size of the large increments.  If specified as 0, the large increments default to  1/10
           the range of the scale.

       Name:     <b>command</b>
       Class:    <b>Command</b>
       Switch:   <b>-command</b>
           Specifies  the  prefix  of  a  perl/Tk callback to invoke whenever the scale's value is changed via a
           method.  The actual command consists of this option followed by a space and a real number  indicating
           the new value of the scale.

       Name:     <b>digits</b>
       Class:    <b>Digits</b>
       Switch:   <b>-digits</b>
           An integer specifying how many significant digits should be retained when converting the value of the
           scale  to  a  string.  If the number is less than or equal to zero, then the scale picks the smallest
           value that guarantees that every possible slider position prints as a different string.

       Name:     <b>from</b>
       Class:    <b>From</b>
       Switch:   <b>-from</b>
           A real value corresponding to the left or top end of the scale.

       Name:     <b>label</b>
       Class:    <b>Label</b>
       Switch:   <b>-label</b>
           A string to display as a label for the scale.  For vertical scales the label is displayed just to the
           right of the top end of the scale.  For horizontal scales the label is displayed just above the  left
           end of the scale.  If the option is specified as an empty string, no label is displayed.

       Name:     <b>length</b>
       Class:    <b>Length</b>
       Switch:   <b>-length</b>
           Specifies  the  desired long dimension of the scale in screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable
           to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>).  For vertical scales this is the scale's height;  for horizontal scales it  is  the
           scale's width.

       Name:     <b>resolution</b>
       Class:    <b>Resolution</b>
       Switch:   <b>-resolution</b>
           A  real  value  specifying the resolution for the scale.  If this value is greater than zero then the
           scale's value will always be rounded to an even multiple of this value, as will tick  marks  and  the
           endpoints  of  the  scale.   If  the  value is less than zero then no rounding occurs.  Defaults to 1
           (i.e., the value will be integral).

       Name:     <b>showValue</b>
       Class:    <b>ShowValue</b>
       Switch:   <b>-showvalue</b>
           Specifies a boolean value indicating whether or  not  the  current  value  of  the  scale  is  to  be
           displayed.

       Name:     <b>sliderLength</b>
       Class:    <b>SliderLength</b>
       Switch:   <b>-sliderlength</b>
           Specfies  the  size  of  the slider, measured in screen units along the slider's long dimension.  The
           value may be specified in any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.

       Name:     <b>sliderRelief</b>
       Class:    <b>SliderRelief</b>
       Switch:   <b>-sliderrelief</b>
           Specifies the relief to use when drawing the slider, such as <b>raised</b> or <b>sunken</b>.

       Name:     <b>state</b>
       Class:    <b>State</b>
       Switch:   <b>-state</b>
           Specifies one of three states for the scale:  <b>normal</b>, <b>active</b>, or <b>disabled</b>.  If the scale is  disabled
           then  the  value may not be changed and the scale won't activate.  If the scale is active, the slider
           is displayed using the color specified by the <b>activeBackground</b> option.

       Name:     <b>tickInterval</b>
       Class:    <b>TickInterval</b>
       Switch:   <b>-tickinterval</b>
           Must be a real value.  Determines the spacing between numerical tick marks displayed below or to  the
           left of the slider.  If 0, no tick marks will be displayed.

       Name:     <b>to</b>
       Class:    <b>To</b>
       Switch:   <b>-to</b>
           Specifies  a  real  value  corresponding  to the right or bottom end of the scale.  This value may be
           either less than or greater than the <b>from</b> option.

       Name:     <b>variable</b>
       Class:    <b>Variable</b>
       Switch:   <b>-variable</b>
           Specifies the name of a global variable to link to the scale.  Whenever the  value  of  the  variable
           changes,  the  scale  will  update  to  reflect  this  value.   Whenever  the  scale  is  manipulated
           interactively, the variable will be modified to reflect the scale's new value.

       Name:     <b>width</b>
       Class:    <b>Width</b>
       Switch:   <b>-width</b>
           Specifies the desired narrow dimension of  the  trough  in  screen  units  (i.e.  any  of  the  forms
           acceptable  to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>).  For vertical scales this is the trough's width;  for horizontal scales
           this is the trough's height.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Scale</b> method creates a new window (given by the $widget argument) and makes it into a  scale  widget.
       Additional  options,  described  above, may be specified on the command line or in the option database to
       configure aspects of the scale such as its colors, orientation, and relief.  The  <b>scale</b>  command  returns
       its  $widget argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named $widget,
       but $widget's parent must exist.

       A scale is a widget that displays a rectangular <u>trough</u> and a small <u>slider</u>.  The trough corresponds  to  a
       range of real values (determined by the <b>from</b>, <b>to</b>, and <b>resolution</b> options), and the position of the slider
       selects  a  particular  real  value.  The slider's position (and hence the scale's value) may be adjusted
       with the mouse or keyboard as described in the "BINDINGS" section below.  Whenever the scale's  value  is
       changed,  a  Tcl  command is invoked (using the <b>command</b> option) to notify other interested widgets of the
       change.  In addition, the value of the scale can be linked to a Tcl variable (using the <b>variable</b> option),
       so that changes in either are reflected in the other.

       Three annotations may be displayed in a scale widget:  a label appearing at the top right of  the  widget
       (top  left  for  horizontal  scales),  a  number displayed just to the left of the slider (just above the
       slider for horizontal scales), and a collection of numerical tick marks just to the left of  the  current
       value  (just  below the trough for horizontal scales).  Each of these three annotations may be enabled or
       disabled using the configuration options.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Scale</b> method creates a widget object.  This object supports the <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b> methods  described
       in  Tk::options  which  can  be  used to enquire and modify the options described above.  The widget also
       inherits all the methods provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.

       The following additional methods are available for scale widgets:

       <u>$scale</u>-&gt;<b>coords</b>(?<u>value</u>?)
           Returns a list whose elements are the x and y coordinates of the point along the  centerline  of  the
           trough that corresponds to <u>value</u>.  If <u>value</u> is omitted then the scale's current value is used.

       <u>$scale</u>-&gt;<b>get</b>(?<u>x,</u> <u>y</u>?)
           If  <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are omitted, returns the current value of the scale.  If <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are specified, they give
           pixel coordinates within the widget;  the command returns the scale value corresponding to the  given
           pixel.  Only one of <u>x</u> or <u>y</u> is used:  for horizontal scales <u>y</u> is ignored, and for vertical scales <u>x</u> is
           ignored.

       <u>$scale</u>-&gt;<b>identify</b>(<u>x,</u> <u>y</u>)
           Returns  a  string  indicating what part of the scale lies under the coordinates given by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>.  A
           return value of <b>slider</b> means that the point is over the slider;  <b>trough1</b> means that the point is over
           the portion of the slider above  or to the left of the slider; and <b>trough2</b> means that  the  point  is
           over  the  portion of the slider below or to the right of the slider.  If the point isn't over one of
           these elements, an empty string is returned.

       <u>$scale</u>-&gt;<b>set</b>(<u>value</u>)
           This command is invoked to change the current value of the scale, and hence the position at which the
           slider is displayed.  <u>Value</u> gives the new value for the scale.  The command  has  no  effect  if  the
           scale is disabled.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk  automatically creates class bindings for scales that give them the following default behavior.  Where
       the behavior is different for vertical and horizontal scales, the horizontal  behavior  is  described  in
       parentheses.

       [1] If  button  1  is  pressed in the trough, the scale's value will be incremented or decremented by the
           value of the <b>resolution</b> option so that the slider moves in the  direction  of  the  cursor.   If  the
           button is held down, the action auto-repeats.

       [2] If button 1 is pressed over the slider, the slider can be dragged with the mouse.

       [3] If  button  1 is pressed in the trough with the Control key down, the slider moves all the way to the
           end of its range, in the direction towards the mouse cursor.

       [4] If button 2 is pressed, the scale's value is set to the mouse position.  If the mouse is dragged with
           button 2 down, the scale's value changes with the drag.

       [5] The Up and Left keys move the slider up (left) by the value of the <b>resolution</b> option.

       [6] The Down and Right keys move the slider down (right) by the value of the <b>resolution</b> option.

       [7] Control-Up and Control-Left move the slider up (left) by the value of the <b>bigIncrement</b> option.

       [8] Control-Down and Control-Right move the slider down (right) by the value of the <b>bigIncrement</b> option.

       [9] Home moves the slider to the top (left) end of its range.

       [10]
           End moves the slider to the bottom (right) end of its range.

           If the scale is disabled using the <b>state</b> option then none of the above bindings have any effect.

           The behavior of scales can be  changed  by  defining  new  bindings  for  individual  widgets  or  by
           redefining the class bindings.
