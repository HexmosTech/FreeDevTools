       Inline::C::Cookbook - A Cornucopia of Inline C Recipes

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       It's a lot easier for most of us to cook a meal from a recipe, rather than just throwing things into a
       pot until something edible forms. So it is with programming as well. "Inline.pm" makes C programming for
       Perl as easy as possible. Having a set of easy to understand samples, makes it simpler yet.

       This Cookbook is intended to be an evergrowing repository of small yet complete coding examples; each
       showing how to accomplish a particular task with Inline. Each example is followed by a short discussion,
       explaining in detail the particular features that are being demonstrated.

       Many of these recipes are adapted from email discussions I have had with Inline users around the world.
       It has been my experience so far, that Inline provides an elegant solution to almost all problems
       involving Perl and C.

       Bon Appetit!

   <b>Hello,</b> <b>world</b>
       Problem

       It seems that the first thing any programmer wants to do when he learns a new programming technique is to
       use it to greet the Earth. How can I do this using Inline?

       Solution
               use Inline C =&gt; &lt;&lt;'...';

               void greet() {
                 printf("Hello, world\n");
               }
               ...

               greet;

       Discussion
           Nothing  too  fancy here. We define a single C function greet() which prints a message to STDOUT. One
           thing to note is that since the Inline code comes before the function call to "greet", we can call it
           as a bareword (no parentheses).

   <b>One</b> <b>Liner</b>
       Problem
           A concept is valid in Perl only if it can be shown to  work  in  one  line.  Can  Inline  reduce  the
           complexities of Perl/C interaction to a one-liner?

       Solution
               perl -e 'use Inline C=&gt;q{void greet(){printf("Hello, world\n");}};greet'

       Discussion
           Try doing that in XS :-)

       See Also
           My email signature of late is:

               perl -le 'use Inline C=&gt;q{SV*JAxH(char*x){return newSVpvf("Just Another %s Hacker",x);}};print JAxH+Perl'

           A bit fancier but a few bytes too long to qualify as a true one liner :-(

       Credits
           "Eli  the Bearded" &lt;<a href="mailto:elijah@workspot.net">elijah@workspot.net</a>&gt; gave me the idea that I should have an Inline one-liner as a
           signature.

   <b>Data</b> <b>Types</b>
       Problem
           How do I pass different types of data to and from Inline  C  functions;  like  strings,  numbers  and
           integers?

       Solution
               # vowels.pl
               use Inline 'C';

               $filename = $ARGV[0];
               die "Usage: perl vowels.pl filename\n" unless -f $filename;

               $text = join '', &lt;&gt;;           # slurp input file
               $vp = vowel_scan($text);       # call our function
               $vp = sprintf("%03.1f", $vp * 100);  # format for printing
               print "The letters in $filename are $vp% vowels.\n";

               __END__
               __C__

               /* Find percentage of vowels to letters */
               double vowel_scan(char* str) {
                 int letters = 0;
                 int vowels = 0;
                 int i = 0;
                 char c;
                 char normalize = 'a' ^ 'A';
                 /* normalize forces lower case in ASCII; upper in EBCDIC */
                 char A = normalize | 'a';
                 char E = normalize | 'e';
                 char I = normalize | 'i';
                 char O = normalize | 'o';
                 char U = normalize | 'u';
                 char Z = normalize | 'z';

                 while(c = str[i++]) {
                   c |= normalize;
                   if (c &gt;= A &amp;&amp; c &lt;= Z) {
                      letters++;
                      if (c == A || c == E || c == I || c == O || c == U)
                        vowels++;
                   }
                 }

                 return letters ? ((double) vowels / letters) : 0.0;
               }

       Discussion
           This script takes a file name from the command line and prints the ratio of vowels to letters in that
           file.  "vowels.pl"  uses  an Inline C function called "vowel_scan", that takes a string argument, and
           returns the percentage of vowels as a floating point number between 0 and 1.  It  handles  upper  and
           lower case letters, and works with ASCII and EBCDIC. It is also quite fast.

           Running this script produces:

               &gt; perl vowels.pl /usr/share/dict/words
               The letters in /usr/share/dict/words are 37.5% vowels.

           It  is  very  important  to  note  that  the examples in this cookbook use "char *" to mean a string.
           Internally Perl has various mechanisms to deal with strings that contain characters with code  points
           above  255,  using  Unicode.  This means that naively treating strings as "char *", an array of 8-bit
           characters, can lead to problems. You need to be aware of this and consider using a UTF-8 library  to
           deal with strings.

   <b>Variable</b> <b>Argument</b> <b>Lists</b>
       Problem

       How do I pass a variable-sized list of arguments to an Inline C function?

       Solution
               greet(qw(Sarathy Jan Sparky Murray Mike));

               use Inline C =&gt; &lt;&lt;'END_OF_C_CODE';

               void greet(SV* name1, ...) {
                 Inline_Stack_Vars;
                 int i;

                 for (i = 0; i &lt; Inline_Stack_Items; i++)
                   printf("Hello %s!\n", SvPV(Inline_Stack_Item(i), PL_na));

                 Inline_Stack_Void;
               }

               END_OF_C_CODE

       Discussion
           This  little  program greets a group of people, such as my coworkers. We use the "C" ellipsis syntax:
           ""..."", since the list can be of any size.

           Since there are no types or names associated with each argument, we can't expect  XS  to  handle  the
           conversions  for  us. We'll need to pop them off the <b>Stack</b> ourselves. Luckily there are two functions
           (macros) that make this a very easy task.

           First, we need to begin our function with a ""Inline_Stack_Vars""  statement.   This  defines  a  few
           internal  variables  that  we  need to access the <b>Stack</b>. Now we can use ""Inline_Stack_Items"", which
           returns an integer containing the number of arguments passed to us from Perl.

           <b>NOTE:</b> It is important to <u>only</u> use ""Inline_Stack_"" macros when there is an ellipsis ("...")  in  the
           argument list, <u>or</u> the function has a return type of void.

           Second, we use the Inline_Stack_Item(x) function to access each argument where "0 &lt;= x &lt; items".

           <b>NOTE:</b>  When  using  a variable length argument list, you have to specify at least one argument before
           the ellipsis. (On my compiler, anyway.) When XS does it's argument checking, it will complain if  you
           pass  in  less  than the number of <u>defined</u> arguments. Therefore, there is currently no way to pass an
           empty list when a variable length list is expected.

   <b>Multiple</b> <b>Return</b> <b>Values</b>
       Problem
           How do I return a list of values from a C function?

       Solution
               print map {"$_\n"} get_localtime(time);

               use Inline C =&gt; &lt;&lt;'END_OF_C_CODE';

               #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/time.h">time.h</a>&gt;

               void get_localtime(SV * utc) {
                 const time_t utc_ = (time_t)SvIV(utc);
                 struct tm *ltime = localtime(&amp;utc_);
                 Inline_Stack_Vars;

                 Inline_Stack_Reset;
                 Inline_Stack_Push(sv_2mortal(newSViv(ltime-&gt;tm_year)));
                 Inline_Stack_Push(sv_2mortal(newSViv(ltime-&gt;tm_mon)));
                 Inline_Stack_Push(sv_2mortal(newSViv(ltime-&gt;tm_mday)));
                 Inline_Stack_Push(sv_2mortal(newSViv(ltime-&gt;tm_hour)));
                 Inline_Stack_Push(sv_2mortal(newSViv(ltime-&gt;tm_min)));
                 Inline_Stack_Push(sv_2mortal(newSViv(ltime-&gt;tm_sec)));
                 Inline_Stack_Push(sv_2mortal(newSViv(ltime-&gt;tm_isdst)));
                 Inline_Stack_Done;
               }
               END_OF_C_CODE

       Discussion
           Perl is a language where it is common to return a list of values from a subroutine  call  instead  of
           just a single value. C is not such a language. In order to accomplish this in C we need to manipulate
           the Perl call stack by hand. Luckily, Inline provides macros to make this easy.

           This  example  calls  the  system "localtime", and returns each of the parts of the time struct; much
           like the perl builtin localtime(). On each stack push, we are creating a new Perl integer (SVIV)  and
           mortalizing  it.  The  <b>sv_2mortal()</b> call makes sure that the reference count is set properly. Without
           it, the program would leak memory.

           NOTE: The "#include" statement is not really needed, because Inline
                 automatically includes the Perl headers which include almost all
                 standard system calls.

   <b>Multiple</b> <b>Return</b> <b>Values</b> <b>(Another</b> <b>Way)</b>
       Problem
           How can I pass back more than one value without using the Perl Stack?

       Solution
               use Inline::Files;
               use Inline 'C';

               my ($foo, $bar);
               change($foo, $bar);

               print "\$foo = $foo\n";
               print "\$bar = $bar\n";

               __C__

               int change(SV* var1, SV* var2) {
                 sv_setpvn(var1, "Perl Rocks!", 11);
                 sv_setpvn(var2, "Inline Rules!", 13);
                 return 1;
               }

       Discussion
           Most perl function interfaces return values as a list of one or more scalars.  Very few like "chomp",
           will modify an input scalar in place. On the other hand, in C you do this  quite  often.  Values  are
           passed in by reference and modified in place by the called function.

           It turns out that we can do that with Inline as well. The secret is to use a type of '"SV*"' for each
           argument that is to be modified. This ensures passing by reference, because no typemapping is needed.

           The  function  can  then use the Perl5 API to operate on that argument. When control returns to Perl,
           the argument will retain the value set by the C function. In  this  example  we  passed  in  2  empty
           scalars and assigned values directly to them.

   <b>Taking</b> <b>an</b> <b>array-ref</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b>
       Problem
           How can I take a Perl array-ref as an argument in my C function?

       Solution
               SV *sum(SV *array) {
                   int total = 0;
                   int numelts, i;
                   if ((!SvROK(array))
                       || (SvTYPE(SvRV(array)) != SVt_PVAV)
                       || ((numelts = av_len((AV *)SvRV(array))) &lt; 0)
                   ) {
                       return &amp;PL_sv_undef;
                   }
                   for (i = 0; i &lt;= numelts; i++) {
                       total += SvIV(*av_fetch((AV *)SvRV(array), i, 0));
                   }
                   return newSViv(total);
               }

       Discussion
           This example returns "undef" if given a non-ref, or a non-array-ref, or a ref to an empty array.  You
           can see how you might expand this to take more than one array-ref.

   <b>Using</b> <b>Memory</b>
       Problem
           How should I allocate buffers in my Inline C code?

       Solution
               print greeting('Ingy');

               use Inline C =&gt; &lt;&lt;'END_OF_C_CODE';

               SV* greeting(SV* sv_name) {
                 return (newSVpvf("Hello %s!\n", SvPV(sv_name, PL_na)));
               }

               END_OF_C_CODE

       Discussion
           In  this  example we will return the greeting to the caller, rather than printing it. This would seem
           mighty easy, except for the fact that we need to allocate a small buffer to create the greeting.

           I would urge you to stay away from "malloc"ing your own buffer.  Just  use  Perl's  built  in  memory
           management.  In  other  words, just create a new Perl string scalar. The function "newSVpv" does just
           that. And "newSVpvf" includes "sprintf" functionality.

           The other problem is getting rid of this new scalar. How will the ref count get decremented after  we
           pass  the  scalar  back? Perl also provides a function called "sv_2mortal". Mortal variables die when
           the context goes out of scope.  In other words, Perl will wait until the new scalar gets passed  back
           and  then  decrement  the  ref  count for you, thereby making it eligible for garbage collection. See
           "perldoc perlguts".

           In this example the "sv_2mortal" call gets done under the hood by XS, because we declared the  return
           type to be "SV*".

           To  view  the  generated XS code, run the command ""perl -MInline=INFO,FORCE,NOCLEAN example004.pl"".
           This will leave the build directory intact and tell you where to find it.

                  }
               }

       Discussion
           There  are really only two points that need an explanation to understand why the above code works. In
           the Perl section, you will notice the declaration

               our $mesh_data = "...";

           For Perl variables to be directly accessible from Inline::C  functions,  they  must  be  declared  as
           package variables. Lexical variables, those declared with <b>my</b>, cannot be accessed this way.

           In  the  C  code  section  of the example, the following line is what makes direct access to the Perl
           variable work;

               char *mesh_data = SvPV_nolen(get_sv("main::mesh_data", 0))

           Here <b>SvPV_nolen()</b> returns a pointer to the C string contained in the scalar  variable.  The  "_nolen"
           variation ignores the length of the C string. Hence, the function takes only a single argument, which
           is the SV* of the scalar variable.

           We  could  have  used the usual two-argument form of <b>SvPV()</b> and, since we don't care about the string
           length, specified <b>PL_na</b> for the second argument. The function call would then change to,

               SvPV(get_sv("main::mesh_data", 0), PL_na)

           The function <b>get_sv()</b> returns the SV* of a named scalar package  variable.   It  takes  a  C  string,
           containing  the  fully  qualified  name  of  the variable, as the first argument. The second argument
           contains flag values related to data type. Since we are only reading  the  scalar  variable,  in  our
           example, a value of 0 can be used.

               }
               END

       Discussion
           The problem with running Inline code from a CGI script is that Inline <b>writes</b> to a build area on  your
           disk  whenever it compiles code. Most CGI scripts don't (and shouldn't) be able to create a directory
           and write into it.

           The solution is to explicitly tell Inline which directory to use  with  the  'use  Inline  Config  =&gt;
           DIRECTORY =&gt; ...' line. Then you need to give write access to that directory from the web server (CGI
           script).

           If  you see this as a security hole, then there is another option. Give write access to yourself, but
           read-only access to the CGI script. Then run the script once by hand (from the  command  line).  This
           will  cause Inline to precompile the C code. That way the CGI will only need read access to the build
           directory (to load in the shared library from there).

           Just remember that whenever you change the C code, you need to precompile it again.

       Discussion
           This is a fully functional mod_perl handler that prints out the factorial values for the numbers 1 to
           100. Since we are using Inline under mod_perl, there are a few considerations to , um, consider.

           First, mod_perl handlers are usually run with "-T" taint detection.  Therefore, we need to enable the
           UNTAINT option. The next thing to deal with is the fact that this handler will most likely be  loaded
           after  Perl's  compile  time.  Since we are using the DATA section, we need to use the special init()
           call. And of course we need to specify a DIRECTORY that mod_perl can compile into. <u>See</u> <u>the</u> <u>above</u>  <u>CGI</u>
           <u>example</u> <u>for</u> <u>more</u> <u>info.</u>

           Other than that, this is a pretty straightforward mod_perl handler, tuned for even more speed!

       Discussion

       Damian Conway has given us myriad ways of implementing OOP in Perl. This is one he might not have thought
       of.

       The  interesting  thing about this example is that it uses Perl for all the OO bindings while using C for
       the attributes and methods.

       If you examine the Perl code everything looks exactly like a regular OO example. There is a "new"  method
       and several accessor methods. The familiar 'arrow syntax' is used to invoke them.

       In  the  class  definition (second part) the Perl "package" statement is used to name the object class or
       namespace. But that's where the similarities end Inline takes over.

       The idea is that we call a C subroutine called new() which returns a blessed scalar. The scalar  contains
       a readonly integer which is a C pointer to a Soldier struct. This is our object.

       The  new()  function  needs  to malloc the memory for the struct and then copy the initial values into it
       using savepv(). This also allocates more memory (which we have to keep track of).

       The accessor methods are pretty straightforward. They return the current value of their attribute.

       The last method DESTROY() is called automatically by Perl whenever an object goes out of scope.  This  is
       where we can free all the memory used by the object.

       That's it. It's a very simplistic example. It doesn't show off any advanced OO features, but it is pretty
       cool  to  see  how  easy  the implementation can be. The important Perl call is newSVrv() which creates a
       blessed scalar.

           One of the most common questions I get is "How can I use Inline to make use of some shared library?".
           Although it has always been possible to do so, the configuration was ugly, and there were no specific
           examples.

           With version 0.30 and higher, you can specify the use of shared libraries easily with something  like
           this:

               use Inline C =&gt; Config =&gt; LIBS =&gt; '-lghttp';
               use Inline C =&gt; "code ...";

           or

               use Inline C =&gt; "code ...", LIBS =&gt; '-lghttp';

           To specify a specific library path, use:

               use Inline C =&gt; "code ...", LIBS =&gt; '-L/your/lib/path -lyourlib';

           To specify an include path use:

               use Inline C =&gt; "code ...",
                          LIBS =&gt; '-lghttp',

   <b>Automatic</b> <b>Function</b> <b>Wrappers</b>
       Problem
           You have some functions in a C library that you want to access from Perl exactly as you would from C.

       Solution
           The error function erf() is probably defined in your standard math library.   Annoyingly,  Perl  does
           not let you access it. To print out a small table of its values, just say:

               perl -le 'use Inline C =&gt; q{ double erf(double); }, enable =&gt; "autowrap"; print "$_ @{[erf($_)]}" for (0..10)'

           The excellent "Term::ReadLine::Gnu" implements Term::ReadLine using the GNU ReadLine library. Here is
           an easy way to access just readline() from that library:

               package MyTerm;

               use Inline C =&gt; Config =&gt;
                          enable =&gt; autowrap =&gt;
                          LIBS =&gt; "-lreadline -lncurses -lterminfo -ltermcap ";
               use Inline C =&gt; q{ char * readline(char *); };

               package main;
               my $x = MyTerm::readline("xyz: ");

           Note  however that it fails to free() the memory returned by readline, and that "Term::ReadLine::Gnu"
           offers a much richer interface.

       Discussion
           We access existing functions by  merely  showing  Inline  their  declarations,  rather  than  a  full
           definition. Of course the function declared must exist, either in a library already linked to Perl or
           in a library specified using the "LIBS" option.

           The  first  example wraps a function from the standard math library, so Inline requires no additional
           "LIBS" directive. The second uses the Config option to specify the libraries that contain the  actual
           compiled C code.

           This behavior is always disabled by default. You must enable the "autowrap" option to make it work.

   <b>Replacing</b> <b>h2xs</b>
       Problem
           You have a complete C library that you want to access from Perl exactly as you would from C.

       Solution
           Just say:

               use IO::All;
               use Inline C =&gt; sub { io('allheaders.h')-&gt;all =~ s/LEPT_DLL extern//gr },
                 enable =&gt; "autowrap",
                 libs =&gt; '-lleptonica';

       Discussion
           In  principle,  you can use h2xs to wrap a C library into an XS module. One problem with this is that
           the C parser code is a little out of date. Also, since it works by  generating  a  number  of  files,
           maintaining it when the C library changes is a certain amount of work. Using Inline to do the work is
           much easier.

           If  the  header  file  needs some processing, like removing some text that a full C compiler can deal
           with, but the Inline::C parser cannot, as  in  the  example  above?  Well,  Perl  is  good  at  text-
           processing.

       Discussion
           The  world  is  not made of scalars alone, although they are definitely the easiest creatures to deal
           with, when doing Inline stuff. Sometimes we need to deal with arrays, hashes,  and  code  references,
           among other things.

           Since Perl subroutine calls only pass scalars as arguments, we'll need to use the argument type "SV*"
           and pass references to more complex types.

           The  above  program  dumps the key/value pairs of a hash. To figure it out, just curl up with perlapi
           for a couple hours. Actually, its fairly straight forward once you are familiar with the calls.

           Note the "croak" function call. This is the proper way to die from your C extensions.

                     hv_store(hash, word, strlen(word),
                       newRV_noinc((SV*)array), 0);

       Discussion
           This is one of the larger recipes. But when you consider the number of calories it has, it's  not  so
           bad.  The  function "load_data" takes the name of a file as it's input. The file "cartoon.text" might
           look like:

               flintstones fred barney
               jetsons     george jane elroy
               simpsons    homer marge bart

           The function will read the file, parsing each line into words.  Then  it  will  create  a  new  hash,
           whereby  the  first  word  in a line becomes a hash key and the remaining words are put into an array
           whose reference becomes the hash value.  The output looks like this:

               $VAR1 = {
                         'flintstones' =&gt; [
                                            'fred',
                                            'barney'
                                          ],
                         'simpsons' =&gt; [
                                         'homer',
                                         'marge',
                                         'bart'
                                       ],
                         'jetsons' =&gt; [
                                        'george',
                                        'jane',
                                        'elroy'
                                      ]
                       };

           This example runs on MS Windows. It makes a text box appear on the screen which contains a message of
           your choice.

           The  important  thing  is that its proof that you can use Inline to interact with Windows DLL-s. Very
           scary indeed. 8-o

           To use Inline on Windows with  ActivePerl  (  &lt;<a href="http://www.ActiveState.com">http://www.ActiveState.com</a>&gt;  )you'll  need  MS  Visual
           Studio. You can also use the Cygwin environment,available at &lt;<a href="http://www.cygwin.com">http://www.cygwin.com</a>&gt; .

       Discussion
           By using CPR. (C Perl Run)

           This  example  uses  another  Inline  module,  "Inline::CPR",  available separately on CPAN. When you
           install this module it also installs a binary interpreter called "/usr/bin/cpr".  (The  path  may  be
           different on your system)

           When  you feed a C program to the CPR interpreter, it automatically compiles and runs your code using
           Inline. This gives you full access to the Perl internals. CPR also provides a set of easy  to  use  C
           macros for calling Perl internals.

           This  means  that you can effectively "run" C source code by putting a CPR hashbang as the first line
           of your C program.

       See Also
           See Inline::CPR for more information on using CPR.

</pre><h4><b>ENTERTAINING</b> <b>GUESTS</b></h4><pre>
       As of version 0.30, Inline has the ability to work in cooperation with other modules that want to  expose
       a C API of their own. The general syntax for doing this is:

           use Inline with =&gt; 'Module';
           use Inline C =&gt; ... ;

       This  tells  "Module"  to pass configuration options to Inline. Options like typemaps, include paths, and
       external libraries, are all resolved automatically so you can just concentrate on writing the functions.

   <b>Event</b> <b>handling</b> <b>with</b> <b>Event</b>
       Problem
           You need to write a C callback for the Event module. Can this be done more easily with Inline?

       Solution
               use Inline with =&gt; 'Event';

               Event-&gt;timer(desc     =&gt; 'Timer #1',
                            interval =&gt; 2,
                            cb       =&gt; \&amp;my_callback,
                           );

               Event-&gt;timer(desc     =&gt; 'Timer #2',
                            interval =&gt; 3,
                            cb       =&gt; \&amp;my_callback,
                           );

               print "Starting...\n";
               Event::loop;

               use Inline C =&gt; &lt;&lt;'END';
               void my_callback(pe_event* event) {
                 pe_timer * watcher = event-&gt;up;

                 printf("%s\n\tEvent priority = %d\n\tWatcher priority = %d\n\n",
                        SvPVX(watcher-&gt;base.desc),
                        event-&gt;prio,
                        watcher-&gt;base.prio
                       );
               }
               END

       Discussion
           The first line tells Inline to load the Event module. Inline then queries [Event}  for  configuration
           information.  It gets the name and location of Event's header files, typemaps and shared objects. The
           parameters that Event returns look like:

               INC =&gt; "-I $path/Event",
               TYPEMAPS =&gt; "$path/Event/typemap",
               MYEXTLIB =&gt; "$path/auto/Event/Event.$so",
               AUTO_INCLUDE =&gt; '#include "EventAPI.h"',
               BOOT =&gt; 'I_EVENT_API("Inline");',

           Doing all of this automatically allows you, the programmer, to simply write a function that  receives
           a pointer of type 'pe_event*'. This gives you access to the Event structure that was passed to you.

           In  this  example,  I  simply print values out of the structure. The Perl code defines 2 timer events
           which each invoke the same callback. The first one, every two seconds,  and  the  second  one,  every
           three seconds.

           As  of  this  writing,  Event is one of a growing number of CPAN module that work in cooperation with
           Inline. Any Alien::Build module (e.g., Alien::OpenMP) works with Inline::C in this way, as does PDL.

       See Also
           Read the Event documentation for more information. It contains a tutorial showing several examples of
           using Inline with Event.

   <b>Calling</b> <b>C</b> <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>and</b> <b>C</b>
       Problem
           I'd  like  to  be  able  to call the same C function from both Perl and C.  Also I like to define a C
           function that <b>doesn't</b> get bound to Perl. How do I do that?

       Solution
               print "9 + 5 = ", add(9, 5), "\n";
               print "SQRT(9^2 + 5^2) = ", pyth(9, 5), "\n";
               print "9 * 5 = ", mult(9, 5), "\n";

               use Inline C =&gt; &lt;&lt;'END_C';
               int add(int x, int y) {
                 return x + y;
               }
               static int mult(int x, int y) {
                 return x * y;
               }
               double pyth(int x, int y) {
                 return sqrt(add(mult(x, x), mult(y, y)));
               }
               END_C

       Discussion
           The program produces:

               9 + 5 = 14
               SQRT(9^2 + 5^2) = 10.295630140987
               Can't locate auto/main/mult.al in @INC ...

           Every Inline function that is bound to Perl is also callable by C. You  don't  have  to  do  anything
           special.  Inline arranges it so that all the typemap code gets done by XS and is out of sight. By the
           time the C function receives control, everything has been converted from Perl to C.

           Of course if your function manipulates the Perl Stack, you probably don't want  to  call  it  from  C
           (unless you <u>really</u> know what you're doing).

           If  you declare a function as "static", Inline won't bind it to Perl. That's why we were able to call
           mult() from C but the call failed from Perl.

   <b>Calling</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>from</b> <b>C</b>
       Problem
           So now that I can call C from Perl, how do I call a Perl subroutine from an Inline C function.

               for(1..5) {

                 c_func_2('This is the second line');
                 print "\n";
               }

               sub perl_sub_1 {
                 print map "$_\n", @_;
               }

               __DATA__
               __C__

               void c_func_2(SV* text) {
                 dSP;

                 ENTER;
                 SAVETMPS;

                 XPUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSVpvf("Plus an extra line")));
                 PUTBACK;

                 call_pv("perl_sub_1", G_DISCARD);

                 FREETMPS;
                 LEAVE;
               }

               void c_func_1(SV* text) {
                 c_func_2(text);
               }

       Discussion
           This demo previously made use of Inline Stack macros only - but that's not the correct way to do  it.
           Instead, base the callbacks on the perlcall documentation (as we're now doing).

           Actually, this program demonstrates calling a C function which calls another C function which in turn
           calls a Perl subroutine.

           The  nice  thing about Inline C functions is that you can call them from both Perl-space <b>and</b> C-space.
           That's because Inline creates a wrapper function around each C function. When you use Perl to call  C
           you're  actually  calling  that  function's  wrapper.  The  wrapper  handles  typemapping  and  Stack
           management, and then calls your C function.

           The first time we call "c_func_1"  which  calls  "c_func_2".  The  second  time  we  call  "c_func_2"
           directly.  "c_func_2"  calls  the  Perl  subroutine  ("perl_sub_1") using the internal "perl_call_pv"
           function. It has to put arguments on the stack by hand. Since there is already one  argument  on  the
           stack when we enter the function, the "XPUSHs" ( which is equivalent to an "Inline_Stack_Push" ) adds
           a second argument.

           We  iterate through a 'for' loop 5 times just to demonstrate that things still work correctly when we
           do that. (This was where the previous rendition, making use  solely  of  Inline  Stack  macros,  fell
           down.)

   <b>Evaling</b> <b>C</b>
       Problem
           I've  totally lost my marbles and I want to generate C code at run time, and "eval" it into Perl. How
           do I do this?

       Solution
               use Inline;
               use Code::Generator;

               my $c_code = generate('foo_function');

               Inline-&gt;bind(C =&gt; $c_code);

               foo_function(1, 2, 3);

       Discussion
           I can't think of a real life application where you would want to generate C code on the fly,  but  at
           least I know how I would do it. :)

           The  bind()  function of Inline let's you bind (compile<u>load</u>execute) C functions at run time. It takes
           all of the same arguments as "use Inline C=&gt; ...".

           The nice thing is that once a particular snippet is compiled, it remains cached so  that  it  doesn't
           need to be compiled again. I can imagine that someday a mad scientist will dream up a self generating
           modeling system that would run faster and faster over time.

           If you know such a person, have them drop me a line.

       Discussion
           If Inline::C is installed and functioning properly, the C  sub  foo  is  called  by  the  perl  code.
           Otherwise, $@ gets set, and the equivalent pure perl function bar is instead called.

           Note, too, that the pure perl sub bar can still be explicitly called even if Inline::C is available.

   <b>Accessing</b> <b>Fortran</b> <b>subs</b> <b>using</b> <b>Inline::C</b>
       Problem
           I've  been  given  a  neat  little  sub  written in fortran that takes, as its args, two integers and
           returns their product. And I would like to use that sub as is from  Inline::C.  By  way  of  example,
           let's say that the fortran source file is named 'prod.f', and that it looks like this:

               integer function sqarea(r,s)
               integer r, s
               sqarea = r*s
               return
               end

       Solution
           We  can't  access  that  code directly, but we can compile it into a library which we <b>can</b> then access
           from Inline::C. Using gcc we could run:

               gfortran -c prod.f -o prod.o
               ar cru libprod.a prod.o

           The function is then accessible as follows:

               use warnings;

               use Inline C =&gt; Config =&gt;
                 LIBS =&gt; '-L/full/path/to/libprod_location -lprod -lgfortran';

               use Inline C =&gt; &lt;&lt;'  EOC';

               int wrap_sqarea(int a, int b) {
                 return sqarea_(&amp;a, &amp;b);
               }

               EOC

               $x = 15;
               $y = $x + 3;
               $ret = wrap_sqarea($x, $y);
               print "Product of $x and $y is $ret\n";

       Discussion
           Note firstly that, although the function is specified  as  'sqarea'  in  the  source  file,  gfortran
           appends an underscore to the name when the source is compiled. (I don't know if <b>all</b> fortran compilers
           do this.) Therefore Inline::C needs to call the function as 'sqarea_'.

           Secondly,  because  fortran  subs  pass  args  by reference, we need to pass the <b>addresses</b> of the two
           integer args to <b>sqarea()</b> when we call it from our Inline::C sub.

           If using g77 instead of gfortran, the only necessary change is that we  specify  '-lg2c'  instead  of
           '-lgfortran' in our 'LIBS' setting.
