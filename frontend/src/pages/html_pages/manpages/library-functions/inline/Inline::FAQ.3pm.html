       Inline-FAQ - The Inline FAQ

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Welcome to the official Inline FAQ. In this case, <b>FAQ</b> means: <b>Formerly</b> <b>Answered</b> <b>Questions</b>

       This is a collection of old, long-winded emails that myself and others have sent to the Inline mailing
       list. (<a href="mailto:inline@perl.org">inline@perl.org</a>) They have been reviewed and edited for general Inline edification. Some of them
       may be related to a specific language. They are presented here in a traditional FAQ layout.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>INLINE</b></h4><pre>
       Since there is only a handful of content so far, all FAQs are currently under this heading.

   <b>How</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>".Inline"</b> <b>or</b> <b>"_Inline"</b> <b>directory?</b>
       I probably need to be more emphatic about the role of "_Inline/" cache directories. Since they are
       created automatically, they are completely disposable. I delete them all the time. And it is fine to have
       a different one for each project. In fact as long as you don't have "<a href="file:~/.Inline/">~/.Inline/</a>" defined, Inline will
       create a new "./_Inline" directory (unless, you've done something to override this automatic process -
       such as using the DIRECTORY config option, or using the "PERL_INLINE_DIRECTORY" environment variable).
       You can move that to "./.Inline" and it will continue to work if you want togive it more longevity and
       hide it from view. There is a long complicated list of rules about how "[_.]Inline/" directories are
       used/created. But it was designed to give you the most flexibility/ease-of-use. Never be afraid to nuke
       'em. They'll just pop right back next time they're needed. :)

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>package</b> <b>Inline</b> <b>code</b> <b>for</b> <b>CPAN?</b>
       This distribution includes Inline::MakeMaker, described below, which takes special steps during the
       installation of your module to make sure the code gets compiled and installed, rather than compiled by
       users at runtime. But, users of your module need to install Inline and the language support module like
       Inline::CPP as prerequisites for your module.

       A better way to distribute your module is with Inline::Module, which takes special steps to remove
       dependencies on Inline::* and convert it to a plain XS module during the construction of your
       distribution before you upload it to CPAN. It also integrates easily with Dist::Zilla and other modern
       authoring tools for a more streamlined authoring experience.

   <b>Whatever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>"SITE_INSTALL"</b> <b>option?</b>
       "SITE_INSTALL" is gone. I was going to leave it in and change the semantics, but thought it better to
       remove it, so people wouldn't try to use it the old way. There is now "_INSTALL_" (but you're not
       supposed to know that :). It works magically through the use of Inline::MakeMaker. I explained this
       earlier but it's worth going through again because it's the biggest change for 0.40.  Here's how to
       'permanently' install an Inline extension (Inline based module) with 0.40:

       1.  Create a module with Inline.

       2.  Test it using the normal / local "_Inline/" cache.

       3.  Create a Makefile.PL (like the one produced by h2xs)

       4.  Change 'use ExtUtils::MakeMaker' to 'use Inline::MakeMaker'

       5.  In the Makefile.PL's <b>WriteMakefile()</b> insert:

               CONFIGURE_REQUIRES  =&gt;  {
                   'Inline::MakeMaker'     =&gt; 0.45,
                   'ExtUtils::MakeMaker'   =&gt; 6.52,
               },

           (See the "Writing Modules with Inline" section of Inline.pod for an explanation / elaboration.)

       6.  Change your 'use Inline C =&gt; DATA' to 'use Inline C =&gt; DATA =&gt; NAME =&gt; Foo

       =&gt;  VERSION  =&gt; 1.23' + Make sure NAME matches your package name ('Foo'), or =&gt; begins with 'Foo::'. + If
       you want to quiet a harmless warning that will =&gt; appear when the module  is  loaded  via  "require",  do
       "Inline-&gt;<b>init()</b>;".  See  =&gt;  "Writing  Modules with Inline" in the Inline pod for details. + Make sure =&gt;
       VERSION matches $Foo::VERSION. This must be a string (not a number) =&gt; matching "/^\d\.\d\d$/" +  Do  the
       perl / make / test / install dance =&gt; (thanks binkley :)

       With  Inline  0.41  (or  thereabouts)  you  can  skip  steps  3  &amp; 4, and just say "perl -MInline=INSTALL
       ./Foo.pm". This will work for non-Inline modules too.  It will become the defacto standard  (since  there
       is  no  easy  standard)  way  of  installing  a Perl module. It will allow Makefile.PL parameters "perl -
       MInline=INSTALL ./Foo.pm - PREFIX=/home/ingy/perl" and things like that. It  will  also  make  use  of  a
       MANIFEST if you provide one.

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>binary</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>using</b> <b>Inline?</b>
       I've  figured out how to create and install a PPM binary distribution; with or without distributing the C
       code! And I've decided to share it with all of you :)

       NOTE: Future versions of Inline will make this process a one line command. But
             for now just use this simple recipe.

       The Inline 0.40 distribution comes with a sample extension module called Math::Simple. Theoretically  you
       could  distribute this module on CPAN. It has all the necessary support for installation. You can find it
       in "Inline- 0.40/modules/Math/Simple/". Here are the steps for converting this into a binary distribution
       <b>without</b> C source code.

       NOTE: The recipient of this binary distribution will need to have the
             PPM.pm module installed. This module requires a lot of other CPAN
             modules. ActivePerl (available for Win32, Linux, and Solaris) has all
             of these bundled. While ActivePerl isn't required, it makes things (a
             lot) easier.

       1.  cd "Inline-0.40/Math/Simple/"

       2.  Divide Simple.pm into two files:

               ---8&lt;--- (Simple.pm)
               package Math::Simple;
               use strict;
               require Exporter;
               @Math::Simple::ISA = qw(Exporter);
               @Math::Simple::EXPORT = qw(add subtract);
               $Math::Simple::VERSION = '1.23';

               use Inline (C =&gt; 'src/Simple.c' =&gt;
                           NAME =&gt; 'Math::Simple',
                           VERSION =&gt; '1.23',
                          );
               1;
               ---8&lt;---
               ---8&lt;--- (src/Simple.c)
               int add (int x, int y) {
                   return x + y;
               }

               int subtract (int x, int y) {
                   return x - y;
               }
               ---8&lt;---

       3.  now you have the Perl in one file and the C in the other. The C code must be

       in a subdirectory. + Note that I also changed the term 'DATA' to the name of the C file. This  will  work
       just  as  if  the  C were still inline. + Run 'perl Makefile.PL' + Run 'make test' + Get the MD5 key from
       "blib/arch/auto/Math/Simple/Simple.inl"  +  Edit  "blib/lib/Math/Simple.pm".   Change  "src/Simple.c"  to
       "02c61710cab5b659efc343a9a830aa73" (the MD5 key)

       1.  Run 'make ppd'

       2.  Edit 'Math-Simple.ppd'. Fill in AUTHOR and ABSTRACT if you wish. Then

       change:

             &lt;CODEBASE HREF="" /&gt;

           to

             &lt;CODEBASE HREF="Math-Simple.tar.gz" /&gt;

       1.  Run:

               tar cvf Math-Simple.tar blib
               gzip --best Math-Simple.tar

       2.  Run:

               tar cvf Math-Simple-1.23.tar Math-Simple.ppd Math-Simple.tar.gz
               gzip --best Math-Simple-1.23.tar

       3.  Distribute Math-Simple-1.23.tar.gz with the following instructions:

           1.  Run:

               gzip -d Math-Simple-1.23.tar.gz tar xvzf Math-Simple-1.23.tar

           2.  Run 'ppm install Math-Simple.ppd'

           3.  Delete Math-Simple.tar and Math-Simple.ppd.

           4.  Test with:

               perl -MMath::Simple -le 'print add(37, 42)'

       That's it. The process should also work with zip instead of tar, but I haven't tried it.

       The  recipient  of the binary must have Perl built with a matching architecture.  Luckily, ppm will catch
       this.

       For a binary dist <b>with</b> C source code, simply omit steps 2, 3, 6, and 7.

       If this seems too hard, then in a future version you should be able to just type:

           make ppm

   <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>"C/t/09parser.t"</b> <b>fail</b> <b>on</b> <b>Cygwin</b> <b>?</b>
       It doesn't always fail on Cygwin, but if you find that it produces "unable to remap .... to same  address
       as parent" errors during the build phase, then it's time for you to run rebaseall.

       See &lt;<a href="http://cygwin.com/faq/faq-nochunks.html">http://cygwin.com/faq/faq-nochunks.html</a>#faq.using.fixing-fork-failures&gt; and, if needed, seek further
       help from the Cygwin mailing list.
