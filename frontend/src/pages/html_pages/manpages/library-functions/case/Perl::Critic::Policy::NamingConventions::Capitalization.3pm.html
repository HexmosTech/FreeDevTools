</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::NamingConventions::Capitalization - Distinguish different program components by
       case.

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is part of the core Perl::Critic distribution.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Conway recommends to distinguish different program components by case.

       Normal subroutines, methods and variables are all in lower case.

           my $foo;            # ok
           my $foo_bar;        # ok
           sub foo {}          # ok
           sub foo_bar {}      # ok

           my $Foo;            # not ok
           my $foo_Bar;        # not ok
           sub Foo     {}      # not ok
           sub foo_Bar {}      # not ok

       Package and class names are capitalized.

           package IO::Thing;     # ok
           package Web::FooBar    # ok

           package foo;           # not ok
           package foo::Bar;      # not ok

       Constants are in all-caps.

           Readonly::Scalar my $FOO = 42;  # ok

           Readonly::Scalar my $foo = 42;  # not ok

       There are other opinions on the specifics, for example, in perlstyle.  This policy can be configured to
       match almost any style that you can think of.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       You can specify capitalization rules for the following things: "packages", "subroutines",
       "local_lexical_variables", "scoped_lexical_variables", "file_lexical_variables", "global_variables",
       "constants", and "labels".

       "constants" are things declared via constant or Readonly.

           use constant FOO =&gt; 193;
           Readonly::Array my @BAR =&gt; qw&lt; a b c &gt;;

       "global_variables" are anything declared using "local", "our", or vars.  "file_lexical_variables" are
       variables declared at the file scope.

       "scoped_lexical_variables" are variables declared inside bare blocks that are outside of any subroutines
       or other control structures; these are usually created to limit scope of variables to a given subset of
       subroutines.  E.g.

           sub foo { ... }

           {
               my $thingy;

               sub bar { ... $thingy ... }
               sub baz { ... $thingy ... }
           }

       All other variable declarations are considered "local_lexical_variables".

       Each of the "packages", "subroutines", "local_lexical_variables", "scoped_lexical_variables",
       "file_lexical_variables", "global_variables", "constants", and "labels" options can be specified as one
       of ":single_case", ":all_lower", ":all_upper:", ":starts_with_lower", ":starts_with_upper", or
       ":no_restriction" or a regular expression; any value that does not start with a colon, ":", is considered
       to be a regular expression.  The ":single_case" tag means a name can be all lower case or all upper case.
       If a regular expression is specified, it is surrounded by "\A" and "\z".

       "packages" defaults to ":starts_with_upper".  "subroutines", "local_lexical_variables",
       "scoped_lexical_variables", "file_lexical_variables", and "global_variables" default to ":single_case".
       And "constants" and "labels" default to ":all_upper".

       There are corresponding "package_exemptions", "subroutine_exemptions",
       "local_lexical_variable_exemptions", "scoped_lexical_variable_exemptions",
       "file_lexical_variable_exemptions", "global_variable_exemptions", "constant_exemptions", and
       "label_exemptions" options that are lists of regular expressions to exempt from the corresponding
       capitalization rule.  These values also end up being surrounded by "\A" and "\z".

       "package_exemptions" defaults to "main".  "global_variable_exemptions" defaults to "\$VERSION @ISA
       @EXPORT(?:_OK)? %EXPORT_TAGS \$AUTOLOAD %ENV %SIG \$TODO".  "subroutine_exemptions" defaults to "AUTOLOAD
       BUILD BUILDARGS CLEAR CLOSE DELETE DEMOLISH DESTROY EXISTS EXTEND FETCH FETCHSIZE FIRSTKEY GETC NEXTKEY
       POP PRINT PRINTF PUSH READ READLINE SCALAR SHIFT SPLICE STORE STORESIZE TIEARRAY TIEHANDLE TIEHASH
       TIESCALAR UNSHIFT UNTIE WRITE" which should cover all the standard Perl subroutines plus those from
       Moose.

       Note that that "package_exemptions" does not check complete package names.  For "Foo::Bar::baz", it will
       check "Foo", "Bar" and "baz" sequentially.

       For example, if you want all local variables to be in all lower-case and global variables to start with
       "G_" and otherwise not contain underscores, but exempt any variable with a name that contains "THINGY",
       you could put the following in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u>:

           [NamingConventions::Capitalization]
           local_lexical_variables = :all_lower
           global_variables = G_(?:(?!_)\w)+
           global_variable_exemptions = .*THINGY.*

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       Handle "use vars".  Treat constant subroutines like constant variables.  Handle bareword file handles.
       There needs to be "schemes" or ways of specifying "perlstyle" or "pbp".  Differentiate lexical Readonly
       constants in scopes.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This policy won't catch problems with the declaration of $y below:

           for (my $x = 3, my $y = 5; $x &lt; 57; $x += 3) {
               ...
           }
