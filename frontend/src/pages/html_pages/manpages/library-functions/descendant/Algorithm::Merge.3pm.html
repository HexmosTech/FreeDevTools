</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       This module complements Algorithm::Diff by providing three-way merge and diff functions.

       In this documentation, the first list to "diff3", "merge", and "traverse_sequences3" is called the
       `original' list.  The second list is the `left' list.  The third list is the `right' list.

       The optional key generation arguments are the same as in Algorithm::Diff.  See Algorithm::Diff for more
       information.

   <b>diff3</b>
       Given references to three lists of items, "diff3" performs a three-way difference.

       This function returns an array of operations describing how the left and right lists differ from the
       original list.  In scalar context, this function returns a reference to such an array.

       Perhaps an example would be useful.

       Given the following three lists,

         original: a b c   e f   h i   k
             left: a b   d e f g   i j k
            right: a b c d e     h i j k

            merge: a b   d e   g   i j k

       we have the following result from diff3:

        [ 'u', 'a',   'a',   'a' ],
        [ 'u', 'b',   'b',   'b' ],
        [ 'l', 'c',   undef, 'c' ],
        [ 'o', undef, 'd',   'd' ],
        [ 'u', 'e',   'e',   'e' ],
        [ 'r', 'f',   'f',   undef ],
        [ 'o', 'h',   'g',   'h' ],
        [ 'u', 'i',   'i',   'i' ],
        [ 'o', undef, 'j',   'j' ],
        [ 'u', 'k',   'k',   'k' ]

       The first element in each row is the array with the difference:

        c - conflict (no two are the same)
        l - left is different
        o - original is different
        r - right is different
        u - unchanged

       The next three elements are the lists from the original, left, and right arrays respectively that the row
       refers to (in the synopsis, these are @ancestor, @a, and @b, respectively).

   <b>merge</b>
       Given references to three lists of items, "merge" performs a three-way merge.  The "merge" function uses
       the "diff3" function to do most of the work.

       The only callback currently used is "CONFLICT" which should be a reference to a subroutine that accepts
       two array references.  The first array reference is to a list of elements from the left list.  The second
       array reference is to a list of elements from the right list.  This callback should return a list of
       elements to place in the merged list in place of the conflict.

       The default "CONFLICT" callback returns the following:

        q{&lt;!-- ------ START CONFLICT ------ --&gt;},
        (@left),
        q{&lt;!-- ---------------------------- --&gt;},
        (@right),
        q{&lt;!-- ------  END  CONFLICT ------ --&gt;},

   <b>traverse_sequences3</b>
       This is the workhorse function that goes through the three sequences and calls the callback functions.

       The following callbacks are supported.

       NO_CHANGE
           This  is  called if all three sequences have the same element at the current position.  The arguments
           are the current positions within each sequence, the first argument being the current position  within
           the first sequence.

       A_DIFF
           This  is  called  if  the  first  sequence  is  different than the other two sequences at the current
           position.  This callback will be called with one, two, or three arguments.

           If one argument, then only the element at the given position from the first sequence is not in either
           of the other two sequences.

           If two arguments, then there is no element in the first sequence that corresponds to the elements  at
           the given positions in the second and third sequences.

           If  three  arguments,  then the element at the given position in the first sequence is different than
           the corresponding element in the other two sequences, but the other two sequences have  corresponding
           elements.

       B_DIFF
           This  is  called  if  the  second  sequence  is different than the other two sequences at the current
           position.  This callback will be called with one, two, or three arguments.

           If one argument, then only the element at the given position from  the  second  sequence  is  not  in
           either of the other two sequences.

           If two arguments, then there is no element in the second sequence that corresponds to the elements at
           the given positions in the first and third sequences.

           If  three  arguments, then the element at the given position in the second sequence is different than
           the corresponding element in the other two sequences, but the other two sequences have  corresponding
           elements.

       C_DIFF
           This  is  called  if  the  third  sequence  is  different than the other two sequences at the current
           position.  This callback will be called with one, two, or three arguments.

           If one argument, then only the element at the given position from the third sequence is not in either
           of the other two sequences.

           If two arguments, then there is no element in the third sequence that corresponds to the elements  at
           the given positions in the first and second sequences.

           If  three  arguments,  then the element at the given position in the third sequence is different than
           the corresponding element in the other two sequences, but the other two sequences have  corresponding
           elements.

       CONFLICT
           This  is  called  if  all three sequences have different elements at the current position.  The three
           arguments are the current positions within each sequence.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Most assuredly there are bugs.  If a pattern similar to the above example  does  not  work,  send  it  to
       &lt;<a href="mailto:jsmith@cpan.org">jsmith@cpan.org</a>&gt; or report it on &lt;<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/">http://rt.cpan.org/</a>&gt;, the CPAN bug tracker.

       Algorithm::Diff's  implementation  of "traverse_sequences" may not be symmetric with respect to the input
       sequences  if  the  second  and  third  sequence  are   of   different   lengths.    Because   of   this,
       "traverse_sequences3"  will  calculate the diffs of the second and third sequences as passed and swapped.
       If the differences are not the same, it will issue an `Algorithm::Diff::diff is not symmetric for  second
       and third sequences...' warning.  It will try to handle this, but there may be some cases where it can't.
