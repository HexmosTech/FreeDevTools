       The Japanese morphological dictionary included in this system originates from ICOT  Free  Software.   The
       following conditions for ICOT Free Software applies to the morphological dictionary of the system.

       Each  User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its original form or modified, to any third
       party or parties, PROVIDED that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear on, or  be
       attached  to, the Program, which is distributed substantially in the same form as set out herein and that
       such intended distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise  contravene  any  of  the
       laws  and  regulations  of  the  countries having jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution
       itself.

       NO WARRANTY

       The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the research and development conducted
       during the project and is provided to users as so produced on an experimental  basis.   Accordingly,  the
       program  is  provided  without any warranty whatsoever, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise.
       The term "warranty" used  herein  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  any  warranty  of  the  quality,
       performance,  merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of the program and the nonexistence of
       any infringement or violation of any right of any third party.

       Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to have  agreed  and  understood,  that
       there  is  no  warranty  whatsoever  for  the  program  and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
       otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.

       Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other organization  that  participated  in  or  was
       otherwise  related  to the development of the program and their respective officials, directors, officers
       and other employees shall be held liable for any and all damages, including, without limitation, general,
       special, incidental and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection with the use  or
       inability  to  use the program or any product, material or result produced or otherwise obtained by using
       the program, regardless of whether they have  been  advised  of,  or  otherwise  had  knowledge  of,  the
       possibility  of  such  damages at any time during the project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to
       have agreed to the foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term  "use"  as  used
       herein  includes,  but  is not limited to, the use, modification, copying and distribution of the program
       and the production of secondary products from the program.

       In the case where the program, whether in its original form or modified, was distributed or delivered  to
       or  received by a user from any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or grants
       independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in writing, such person, organization or  entity,
       will  also be exempted from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted above as far
       as the program is concerned.
