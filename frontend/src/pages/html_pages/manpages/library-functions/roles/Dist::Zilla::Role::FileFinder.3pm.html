</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinder - something that finds files within the distribution

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 6.032

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A FileFinder plugin locates files within the distribution.  This role exists so that sets of files can be
       easily described in one configuration section and then used by one or more other plugin.

       Plugins implementing this role must provide a "find_files" method which will be called with no arguments
       and must return an arrayref of files.  (This arrayref should not be re-used, as it may be altered once
       returned.)

       For example, imagine a simple glob-like FileFinder that expects configuration like this:

         [Glob / RootModules]
         glob = *.pm

       This sets up a FileFinder named "RootModules" which will contain all <u>pm</u> files in the root directory.

       Another plugin that knows how to use FileFinder plugins might be configured like this:

         [ModuleRelocator]
         finder = RootModules
         relocate_to = attic

       Finders may operate on any rules they like, checking file size, content, name, or other properties.  They
       should re-perform their "finding" on each call to "find_files" as the files in the distribution may have
       changed.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
