</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Code::TidyAll::Role::RunsCommand - A role for plugins which run external commands

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.84

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package Whatever;
           use Moo;
           with 'Code::TidyAll::Role::RunsCommand';

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a a role for plugins which run external commands

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       cmd The command to run. This is just the executable and should not include additional arguments.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>_run_or_die(@argv)</b>
       This method run the plugin's command, combining any values provided to the plugin's "argv" attribute with
       those passed to the method.

       The  plugin's  "argv" attribute is parsed with the "shellwords" subroutine from Text::ParseWords in order
       to turn the "argv" string into a list. This ensures that running the command does not spawn  an  external
       shell.

       The @argv passed to the command comes after the values from "argv" attribute. The assumption is that this
       will be what passes a file or source string to the external command.

       If  the  command exits with a non-zero status, then this method throws an exception. The error message it
       throws include the command that was run (with arguments), the exit status, any  signal  received  by  the
       command, and the command's output.

       Both "stdout" and "stderr" from the command are combined into a single string returned by the method.

   <b>_is_bad_exit_code($code)</b>
       This  method  returns true if the exit code is bad and false otherwise. By default all non-zero codes are
       bad, but some programs may be expected to exit non-0 when they encounter validation/tidying issues.
