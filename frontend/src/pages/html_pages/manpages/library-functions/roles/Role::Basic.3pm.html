</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Role::Basic - Just roles. Nothing else.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.13

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       In a role:

           package Does::Serialize::AsYAML;
           use Role::Basic;
           use YAML::Syck;
           requires 'as_hash';

           sub serialize {
               my $self = shift;
               return Dump( $self-&gt;as_hash );
           }

           1;

       In your class:

           package My::Class;
           use Role::Basic 'with';

           with qw(
               Does::Serialize::AsYAML
           );

           sub as_hash { ... } # because the role requires it

</pre><h4><b>BETA</b> <b>CODE</b></h4><pre>
       This code appears to be stable and currently passes over 300 tests. We've not (yet) heard of any bugs.
       There are no functional changes with this release.  It's merely here to let early-adopters know it's safe
       to give it a spin.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For an extended discussion, see
       &lt;<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2010/12/rolebasic---when-you-only-want-roles.html">http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2010/12/rolebasic---when-you-only-want-roles.html</a>&gt;.

       Sometimes you want roles. You're not sure about Moose, Mouse, Moo and what <u>was</u> that damned Squirrel thing
       anyway?  Then there's Class::Trait, but it has a funky syntax and the maintainer's deprecated it in favor
       of Moose::Role and you really don't care that it handles overloading, instance application or has a
       workaround for the SUPER:: bug.  You think a meta-object protocol sounds nifty, but you don't understand
       it.  Maybe you're not sure you want the syntactic sugar for object declaration.  Maybe you've convinced
       your colleagues that roles are a good idea but they're leery of dragging in Moose (your author has had
       this happen more than once and heard of others making the same complaint). Sometimes you just want good
       old-fashioned roles which let you separate class responsibility from code reuse.

       Whatever your reasons, this is the module you're looking for. It only provides roles and its major design
       goals are safety and simplicity.  It also aims to be a <u>subset</u> of Moose::Role behavior so that when/if
       you're ready to upgrade, there will be minimal pain.

</pre><h4><b>DECLARING</b> <b>A</b> <b>ROLE</b></h4><pre>
       To declare the current package as a role, simply add the following line to the package:

           use Role::Basic;

       You can then use "with" to consume other roles and "requires" to list the methods this role requires.
       Note that the <u>only</u> methods the role will provide are methods declared directly in the role or consumed
       from other roles. Thus:

           package My::Role;
           use Role::Basic;
           use List::Util 'sum'; # this will not be provided by the role
           with 'Some::Other::Role'; # any methods from this role will be provided

           sub some_method {...} # this will be provided by the role

   <b>Allowed</b> <b>methods</b> <b>in</b> <b>roles</b>
       <b>Warning</b>: this functionality is experimental and is subject to change with no warning.

       As mentioned, methods imported into a role are not provided by that role.  However, this can make it very
       hard when you want to provide simple getters/setters. To get around this limitation, a role (and only
       roles, not classes) may specify one class which they 'allow' to provide additional methods:

           package My::Role;
           use Role::Basic allow =&gt; 'Class::BuildMethods';
           use Class::BuildMethods qw/foo bar/;

           # your role will now provide foo and bar methods
           # rest of role definition here

       Please note that if you do this, the code which provides these 'extra' methods should not provide them in
       a way which is incompatible with your objects. For example, many getter/setters generation classes assume
       you're using a blessed hashref. Most objects are, but the role should not make such an assumption about
       the class which consumes it. In the above example, we use Class::BuildMethods. It's agnostic about your
       object implementation, but it's slow.

       See &lt;<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2011/01/happy-new-yearroles.html">http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2011/01/happy-new-yearroles.html</a>&gt; and search for 'glue' to
       understand why this is important.

</pre><h4><b>CONSUMING</b> <b>ROLES</b></h4><pre>
       To declare the current package as a class that will use roles, simply add the following line to the
       package:

           use Role::Basic 'with';

       Just as with Moose, you can have "-alias", "-excludes", and "-version".

       Unlike Moose, we also provide a "-rename" target.  It combines "-alias" and "-excludes". This code:

           package My::Class;
           use Role::Basic 'with';

           with 'My::Role' =&gt; {
               -rename =&gt; { foo =&gt; 'baz', bar =&gt; 'gorch' },
           };

       Is identical to this code:

           package My::Class;
           use Role::Basic 'with';

           with 'My::Role' =&gt; {
               -alias    =&gt; { foo =&gt; 'baz', bar =&gt; 'gorch' },
               -excludes =&gt; [qw/foo bar/],
           };

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Both roles and classes will receive the following methods:

       •   "with"

           "with"  accepts  a  list  and  may  only be called <b>once</b> per role or class. This is because calling it
           multiple times removes composition safety.  Just  as  with  Moose::Role,  any  class  may  also  have
           "-alias" or "-excludes".

               package My::Class;
               use Role::Basic 'with';

               with 'Does::Serialize::AsYAML' =&gt; { -alias =&gt; { serialize =&gt; 'as_yaml' } };

           And later:

               print $object-&gt;as_yaml;

       •   "DOES"

           Returns true if the class or role consumes a role of the given name:

            if ( $class-&gt;DOES('Does::Serialize::AsYAML') ) {
               ...
            }

           Every role "DOES" itself.

       Further, if you're a role, you can also specify methods you require:

       •   "requires"

               package Some::Role;
               use Role::Basic;

               # roles can consume other roles
               with 'Another::Role';

               requires qw(
                   first_method
                   second_method
                   another_method
               );

           In  the  example  above,  if  "Another::Role"  has  methods  it  requires,  they will be added to the
           requirements of "Some::Role".

</pre><h4><b>DESIGN</b> <b>GOALS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are two overriding design goals for "Role::Basic": <b>simplicity</b> and <b>safety</b>.  We make it a bit  harder
       to  shoot  yourself  in the foot and we aim to keep the code as simple as possible.  Feature requests are
       welcomed, but will not be acted upon if they violate either of these two design goals.

       Thus, if you need something which "Role::Basic" does not support, you're strongly encouraged to  consider
       Moose or Mouse.

       The following list details the outcomes of this module's goals.

       •   Basic role support

           This  includes  composing  into  your  class,  composing  roles  from  other  roles,  roles declaring
           requirements and conflict resolution.

       •   Moose-like syntax

           To ease migration difficulties, we use a Moose-like syntax. If you wish to upgrade to Moose later, or
           you find that others on your project are already familiar with Moose, this should make  "Role::Basic"
           easier to learn.

       •   No handling of SUPER:: bug

           A  well-known  bug  in OO Perl is that a SUPER:: method is invoked against the class its declared in,
           not against the class of the invocant. Handling this properly generally involves  eval'ing  a  method
           directly into the correct package:

               eval &lt;&lt;"END_METHOD";
               package $some_package;

               sub some_method { ... }
               END_METHOD

           Or using a different method resolution order (MRO) such as with Class::C3 or friends. We alert you to
           this  limitation  but make no attempt to address it.  We consider this a feature because roles should
           not know or care how they are composed and probably should not know if  a  superclass  exists.   This
           helps to keep this module simple, a primary design goal.

       •   Composition Safety

           In addition to the normal conflict resolution, only one "with" statement is allowed:

               package Foo;
               use Role::Basic;
               with 'Some::Role';
               with 'Another::Role'; # boom!

           This  is  because when you have more than one "with" statement, the latter will ignore conflicts with
           the first. We could work around this, but this would be significantly different from the behavior  of
           Moose.

       •   Override Safety

           By  default,  we  aim  to behave like Moose::Role.  This means that if a class consuming a role has a
           method with the same name the role provides, the class <u>silently</u>  wins.   This  has  been  a  somewhat
           contentious  issue  in  the  "Moose" community and the "silent" behaviour has won. However, there are
           those who prefer that they don't have  their  methods  silently  ignored.  We  provide  two  optional
           environment variables to handle this:

               $ENV{PERL_ROLE_OVERRIDE_WARN}
               $ENV{PERL_ROLE_OVERRIDE_DIE}

           If  you  prefer, you can set one of those to true and a class overridding a role's method will "warn"
           or "die", as appropriate.  As you might expect, you can handle this with  normal  role  behaviour  or
           exclusion or aliasing.

               package My::Class;
               use Role::Basic 'with';
               with 'My::Role' =&gt; { -excludes =&gt; 'conflicting_method' };

           From  your  author's  email  exchanges with the authors of the original traits paper (referenced here
           with permission), the "class silently wins" behaviour was not intended.  About this,  Dr.  Andrew  P.
           Black wrote the following:

               Yes, it is really important that a programmer can see clearly when a trait
               method is being overridden -- just as it is important that it is clear
               when an inherited method is being overridden.

               In Smalltalk, where a program is viewed as a graph of objects, the obvious
               solution to this problem is to provide an adequate tool to show the
               programmer interesting properties of the program.  The original traits
               browser did this for Smalltalk; the reason that we implemented it is that
               traits were really NOT a good idea (that is,they were not very usable or
               maintainable) without it.  Since then, the same sort of "virtual
               protocols" have been built into the browser for other properties, like
               "overridden methods".

           Note  that  those  are provided as environment variables and not as syntax in the code itself to help
           keep the code closer to the Moose syntax.

       •   No instance application

           "Role::Basic" does not support applying roles to object instances.  This may change in the future.

       •   No method modifiers

           These have been especially problematic.  Consider a "before" modifier which multiplies a value  by  2
           and  another  before  modifier  which  divides  a  value by 3. The order in which those modifiers are
           applied becomes extremely important.  and role-consumption is no  longer  entirely  declarative,  but
           becomes  partially  procedural. This causes enough problems that on Sep 14, 2010 on the Moose mailing
           list, Stevan Little wrote:

               I totally agree [with the described application order problems], and if I
               had to do it over again, I would not have allowed method modifiers in
               roles. They ruin the unordered-ness of roles and bring about edge cases
               like this that are not so easily solved.

           Thus, "Role::Basic" does not and <u>will</u> <u>not</u> support method modifiers. If you need them, consider Moose.
