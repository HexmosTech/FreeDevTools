</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::Role::File - something that can act like a file

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 6.032

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This role describes a file that may be written into the shipped distribution.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>name</b>
       This is the name of the file to be written out.

   <b>added_by</b>
       This is a list of strings describing when and why the file was added to the distribution and when it was
       updated (its content, filename, or other attributes).  It will generally be updated by a plugin
       implementing the FileMunger role.  Its accessor will return the list of strings, concatenated with '; '.

   <b>mode</b>
       This is the mode with which the file should be written out.  It's an integer with the usual "chmod"
       semantics.  It defaults to 0644.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>is_bytes</b>
       Returns true if the "encoding" is bytes.  When true, accessing "content" will be an error.
