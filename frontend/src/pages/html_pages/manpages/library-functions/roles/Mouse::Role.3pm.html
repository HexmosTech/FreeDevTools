</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mouse::Role - The Mouse Role

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Mouse version v2.5.11

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package Comparable;
           use Mouse::Role; # the package is now a Mouse role

           # Declare methods that are required by this role
           requires qw(compare);

           # Define methods this role provides
           sub equals {
               my($self, $other) = @_;
               return $self-&gt;compare($other) == 0;
           }

           # and later
           package MyObject;
           use Mouse;
           with qw(Comparable); # Now MyObject can equals()

           sub compare {
               # ...
           }

           my $foo = MyObject-&gt;new();
           my $bar = MyObject-&gt;new();
           $obj-&gt;equals($bar); # yes, it is comparable

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module declares the caller class to be a Mouse role.

       The concept of roles is documented in Moose::Manual::Roles.  This document serves as API documentation.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTED</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Mouse::Role supports all of the functions that Mouse exports, but differs slightly in how some items are
       handled (see "CAVEATS" below for details).

       Mouse::Role also offers two role-specific keywords:

   <b>requires(@method_names)</b>
       Roles can require that certain methods are implemented by any class which "does" the role.

       Note that attribute accessors also count as methods for the purposes of satisfying the requirements of a
       role.

   <b>excludes(@role_names)</b>
       This is exported but not implemented in Mouse.

</pre><h4><b>IMPORT</b> <b>AND</b> <b>UNIMPORT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>import</b>
       Importing Mouse::Role will give you sugar. "-traits" are also supported.

   <b>unimport</b>
       Please unimport ("no Mouse::Role") so that if someone calls one of the keywords (such as "has") it will
       break loudly instead breaking subtly.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Role support has only a few caveats:

       •   Roles  cannot use the "extends" keyword; it will throw an exception for now.  The same is true of the
           "augment" and "inner" keywords (not sure those really make sense for roles). All other Mouse keywords
           will be <u>deferred</u> so that they can be applied to the consuming class.

       •   Role composition does its best to <b>not</b> be order-sensitive when it comes  to  conflict  resolution  and
           requirements  detection.  However,  it  is  order-sensitive  when  it  comes to method modifiers. All
           before/around/after modifiers are included whenever a role is composed into a class, and then applied
           in the order in  which  the  roles  are  used.  This  also  means  that  there  is  no  conflict  for
           before/around/after modifiers.

           In  most  cases, this will be a non-issue; however, it is something to keep in mind when using method
           modifiers in a role. You should never assume any ordering.
