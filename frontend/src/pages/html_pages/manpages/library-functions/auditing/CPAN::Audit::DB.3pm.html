</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPAN::Audit::DB - the CPAN Security Advisory data as a Perl data structure, mostly for CPAN::Audit

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This module is primarily used by CPAN::Audit.

               use CPAN::Audit::DB;

               my $db = CPAN::Audit::DB-&gt;db;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "db" subroutine returns the CPAN Security Advisory (CPANSA) reports as a Perl data structure.
       However, anything can use this.

       Each release also comes with a <u>.gpg</u> file that has the signature for the file. If you cannot confirm that
       the module file has the right signature, it might have been corrupted or modified.

       This module is available outside of CPAN as a release on GitHub:
       &lt;https://github.com/briandfoy/cpan-security-advisory/releases&gt;.  Each release on GitHub includes an
       attestation.

       There is also a JSON file that provides the same datastructure.

   <b>Subroutines</b>
       There is exactly one subroutine:

       •   db

           Returns the hashref of all the CPANSA reports.

</pre><h4><b>VERIFYING</b></h4><pre>
       This  distribution  now  uses  GitHub  Attestations &lt;https://github.blog/2024-05-02-introducing-artifact-
       attestations-now-in-public-beta/&gt;, which allow you to verify that the archive file you have was made from
       the official repo.

       You need a GitHub account and the gh tool &lt;https://github.com/larsks/ghcli&gt;.

               # download the distro file from GitHub, MetaCPAN, or a CPAN mirror
               $ gh auth login
               ...follow instructions...
               $ gh attestation verify CPANSA-DB-20241111.tar.gz --owner briandfoy

       Additionally, each release codes with GPG signature that allows you to verify that this. The key  is  the
       same one used when the database was distributed with CPAN::Audit:

               $ gpg --verify lib/CPANSA/DB.pm.gpg lib/CPANSA/DB.pm
               gpg: Signature made Mon Nov 18 11:00:10 2024 EST
               gpg:                using RSA key 75AAB42CBA0D7F37F0D6886DF83F8D5E878B6041
               gpg: Good signature from "CPAN::Audit (brian d foy) (https://github.com/briandfoy/cpan-audit) &lt;<a href="mailto:bdfoy@cpan.org">bdfoy@cpan.org</a>&gt;" [ultimate]
