</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPAN::SQLite::Index - set up or update database tables.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.220

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        my $index = CPAN::SQLite::Index-&gt;new(setup =&gt; 1);
        $index-&gt;index();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the main module used to set up or update the database tables used to store information from the
       CPAN and ppm indices. The creation of the object

        my $index = CPAN::SQLite::Index-&gt;new(%args);

       accepts two possible arguments:

       •  setup =&gt; 1

          This  (optional)  argument  specifies  that the database is being set up.  Any existing tables will be
          dropped.

       •  reindex =&gt; value

          This (optional) argument specifies distribution names that one would like to reindex  in  an  existing
          database.  These  may  be  specified  as  either  a  scalar, for a single distribution, or as an array
          reference for a list of distributions.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       Calling

         $index-&gt;index();

       will start the indexing procedure. Various messages detailing the progress will written to <u>STDOUT</u>,  which
       by  default  will  be  captured into a file <u>cpan_sqlite_log.dddddddddd</u>, where the extension is the "time"
       that the method was invoked. Error messages are not captured, and will appear in <u>STDERR</u>.

       The steps of the indexing procedure are as follows.

       •   download existing pre-compiled index (optional)

           If CPAN_SQLITE_DOWNLOAD or CPAN_SQLITE_DOWNLOAD_URL variables are set, an already existing and up-to-
           date    cpandb.sql    file    will    be    downloaded    from    either     specified     URL     or
           <a href="http://cpansqlite.trouchelle.com/">http://cpansqlite.trouchelle.com/</a>  where  it's updated every hour. This greatly increases performance
           and decreases CPU and memory consumption during the indexing process but if your CPAN mirror is  out-
           of-sync  or  you're  using  DarkPAN,  it  obviously  wouldn't  work. It also wouldn't work without an
           internet connection.

           See WWW::CPAN::SQLite if you want to setup your own service for pre-compiling the database.

           If neither variable is set, this step is skipped.

       •   fetch index data

           The       necessary       CPAN       index       files       <u>$CPAN/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz</u>        and
           <u>$CPAN/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz</u>  will  be fetched from the CPAN mirror specified by the $cpan
           variable at the beginning of CPAN::SQLite::Index. If you are using this option, it is recommended  to
           use the same CPAN mirror with subsequent updates, to ensure consistency of the database. As well, the
           information on the locations of the CPAN mirrors used for Template-Toolkit and GeoIP is written.

       •   get index information

           Information from the CPAN indices is extracted through CPAN::SQLite::Info.

       •   get state information

           Unless  the  "setup"  argument within the "new" method of CPAN::SQLite::Index is specified, this will
           get information on the state of the database through CPAN::SQLite::State.  A comparison is then  made
           between  this  information  and  that gathered from the CPAN indices, and if there's a discrepancy in
           some items, those items are marked for either insertion, updating, or deletion, as appropriate.

       •   populate the database

           At  this  stage  the   gathered   information   is   used   to   populate   the   database,   through
           CPAN::SQLite::Populate,  either  inserting  new  items,  updating existing ones, or deleting obsolete
           items.
