</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Plucene::Index::Writer - write an index.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               my $writer = Plucene::Index::Writer-&gt;new($path, $analyser, $create);

               $writer-&gt;add_document($doc);
               $writer-&gt;add_indexes(@dirs);

               $writer-&gt;optimize; # called before close

               my $doc_count = $writer-&gt;doc_count;

               my $mergefactor = $writer-&gt;mergefactor;

               $writer-&gt;set_mergefactor($value);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the writer class.

       If an index will not have more documents added for a while and optimal search performance is desired,
       then the "optimize" method should be called before the index is closed.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
               my $writer = Plucene::Index::Writer-&gt;new($path, $analyser, $create);

       This will create a new Plucene::Index::Writer object.

       The third argument to the constructor determines whether a new index is created, or whether an existing
       index is opened for the addition of new documents.

   <b>mergefactor</b> <b>/</b> <b>set_mergefactor</b>
               my $mergefactor = $writer-&gt;mergefactor;

               $writer-&gt;set_mergefactor($value);

       Get / set the mergefactor. It defaults to 5.

   <b>doc_count</b>
               my $doc_count = $writer-&gt;doc_count;

   <b>add_document</b>
               $writer-&gt;add_document($doc);

       Adds a document to the index. After the document has been added, a merge takes place if there are more
       than $Plucene::Index::Writer::mergefactor segments in the index. This defaults to 10, but can be set to
       whatever value is optimal for your application.

   <b>optimize</b>
               $writer-&gt;optimize;

       Merges all segments together into a single segment, optimizing an index for search. This should be the
       last method called on an indexer, as it invalidates the writer object.

   <b>add_indexes</b>
               $writer-&gt;add_indexes(@dirs);

       Merges all segments from an array of indexes into this index.

       This may be used to parallelize batch indexing.  A large document collection can be broken into sub-
       collections.  Each sub-collection can be indexed in parallel, on a different thread, process or machine.
       The complete index can then be created by merging sub-collection indexes with this method.

       After this completes, the index is optimized.
