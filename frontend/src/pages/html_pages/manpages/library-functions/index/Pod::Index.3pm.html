</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Index - Index and search PODs using X&lt;&gt; entries.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           ### to create an index:
           use Pod::Index::Builder;

           my $p = Pod::Index::Builder-&gt;new;
           for my $file (@ARGV) {
               $p-&gt;parse_from_file($file);
           }

           $p-&gt;print_index("index.txt");

           ### to search for a keyword in the index:
           use Pod::Index::Search;

           my $q = Pod::Index::Search-&gt;new(
               filename =&gt; 'index.txt',
           );

           my @results = $q-&gt;search('getprotobyname');

           for my $r (@results) {
               printf "%s\t%s\n", $r-&gt;podname, $r-&gt;line;
               print $r-&gt;pod;
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Pod-Index distribution includes various modules for indexing and searching POD that is appropriately
       marked with X&lt;&gt; POD codes.

       "Pod::Index", as a module, does nothing. Everything is done by Pod::Index::Builder, Pod::Index::Search,
       and other helper modules.

       This document discusses some of the general issues with POD indexing; specifically, the recommended
       conventions for the use of X&lt;&gt; codes.

</pre><h4><b>BACKGROUND</b></h4><pre>
       The little-known (or at least little-used) X&lt;&gt; formatting code is described in perlpod:

         "X&lt;topic name&gt;" -- an index entry
           This is ignored by most formatters, but some may use it for build-
           ing indexes.  It always renders as empty-string.  Example: "X&lt;abso-
           lutizing relative URLs&gt;"

</pre><h4><b>CONVENTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>THE</b> <b>USE</b> <b>OF</b> <b>X&lt;&gt;</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Placement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>X&lt;&gt;</b> <b>entries</b>
       First, a definition. By "scope", I mean the part of the document that is deemed relevant to an index
       entry, and that may be extracted and shown in isolation by a processing or display tool. For example,
       perldoc -f considers the scope of a function to end at the beginning of the next =item, or at the end of
       the enclosing =over.

       The X&lt;&gt; entries should be added at the end of a command or textblock paragraph (verbatim paragraphs are
       excluded). The scope of the index entry starts at the beginning of the paragraph to which it was
       attached; the end of the scope depends on the command type:

       1) if the X&lt;&gt; is at the end of a textblock, the scope is that paragraph and zero or more verbatim
       paragraphs immediately following it.

       2) if the X&lt;&gt; is at the end of a command paragraph, it depends on the type of command:

       =head1, head2, etc.
           The  scope  ends  right before the next heading with equal or higher level. That is, a =head1 ends at
           the next =head1, and a =head2 ends at the next =head2 or =head1.

       =item
           The scope ends right before the next =item, or the =back that terminates the containing  list.  Note:
           "empty" items are not counted for terminating scopes, to allow for cases where multiple =items head a
           block of text. For example,

               =item function
               X&lt;function&gt;
               X&lt;otherfunction&gt;

               =item otherfunction

               C&lt;function&gt; and C&lt;otherfunction&gt; do the same thing,
               even if they    have different names...

               =item lemonade

           Here the scope of the X&lt;function&gt; and X&lt;otherfunction&gt; entries starts with "=item function", and ends
           right before "=item lemonade".

       3)  other  command  paragraphs,  such  as  =back,  =over,  =begin,  =end, and =for should not be used for
       attaching X&lt;&gt; entries.

   <b>Content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>X&lt;&gt;</b> <b>entry.</b>
       •   It should contain plain text without further formatting codes (with the possible exception of E&lt;&gt;).

       •   It should be in lowercase, unless caps are required due to case-sensitivity or correctness.

       •   Non-word characters are allowed, so one can list things like operators and special variables.

       •   Use of synonyms is encouraged, to make things easier to find.

       •   To be consistent, words should be normalized to the singular  whenever  possible.  For  example,  use
           X&lt;operator&gt; instead of X&lt;operators&gt;.

       •   The  use  of  a  comma  in an index entry has a special meaning: it separates levels of hierarchy (or
           namespaces), as a way of classifying  entries  in  more  specific  ways.  For  example,  "X&lt;operator,
           logical&gt;",  or  "X&lt;operator,  logical,  xor&gt;". This information may be used by processing programs to
           arrange the entries, or for listing results when a  user  searches  for  a  namespace  that  contains
           several entries.

       •   There's  no  limitation  as  to  the  number  of times that a given entry can appear in a document or
           collection of documents. That is, it is not an error to have X&lt;whatever&gt; appear  twice  in  the  same
           file.
