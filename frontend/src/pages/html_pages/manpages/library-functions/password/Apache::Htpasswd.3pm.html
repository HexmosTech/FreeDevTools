       Apache::Htpasswd - Manage Unix crypt-style password file.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Apache::Htpasswd;

           $foo = new Apache::Htpasswd("path-to-file");

           $foo = new Apache::Htpasswd({passwdFile =&gt; "path-to-file",
                                        ReadOnly   =&gt; 1}
                                       );

           # Add an entry
           $foo-&gt;htpasswd("zog", "password");

           # Change a password
           $foo-&gt;htpasswd("zog", "new-password", "old-password");

           # Change a password without checking against old password

           $foo-&gt;htpasswd("zog", "new-password", {'overwrite' =&gt; 1});

           # Check that a password is correct
           $foo-&gt;htCheckPassword("zog", "password");

           # Fetch an encrypted password
           $foo-&gt;fetchPass("foo");

           # Delete entry
           $foo-&gt;htDelete("foo");

           # If something fails, check error
           $foo-&gt;error;

           # Write in the extra info field
           $foo-&gt;writeInfo("login", "info");

           # Get extra info field for a user
           $foo-&gt;fetchInfo("login");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module comes with a set of methods to use with htaccess password files. These files (and htaccess)
       are used to do Basic Authentication on a web server.

       The passwords file is a flat-file with login name and their associated crypted password. You can use this
       for non-Apache files if you wish, but it was written specifically for .htaccess style files.

   <b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       Apache::Htpasswd-&gt;new(...);
           As  of version 1.5.4 named params have been added, and it is suggested that you use them from here on
           out.

                   Apache::Htpasswd-&gt;new("path-to-file");

           "path-to-file" should be the path and name of the file containing the login/password information.

                   Apache::Htpasswd-&gt;new({passwdFile =&gt; "path-to-file",
                                          ReadOnly   =&gt; 1,
                                          UseMD5     =&gt; 1,
                                        });

           This is the perferred way to instantiate an object. The 'ReadOnly' param is optional, and  will  open
           the  file  in read-only mode if used. The 'UseMD5' is also optional: it will force MD5 password under
           Unix.

           If you want to support plain un-encrypted passwords, then you need to set the UsePlain  option  (this
           is NOT recommended, but might be necessary in some situations)

       error;
           If a method returns an error, or a method fails, the error can be retrieved by calling <b>error()</b>

       htCheckPassword("login", "password");
           Finds if the password is valid for the given login.

           Returns 1 if passes.  Returns 0 if fails.

       htpasswd("login", "password");
           This will add a new user to the password file.  Returns 1 if succeeds.  Returns undef on failure.

       htDelete("login")
           Delete users entry in password file.

           Returns 1 on success Returns undef on failure.

       htpasswd("login", "new-password", "old-password");
           If  the  <u>old-password</u> matches the <u>login's</u> password, then it will replace it with <u>new-password</u>. If the
           <u>old-password</u> is not correct, will return 0.

       htpasswd("login", "new-password", {'overwrite' =&gt; 1});
           Will replace the password for the login. This will force the password  to  be  changed.  It  does  no
           verification of old-passwords.

           Returns 1 if succeeds Returns undef if fails

       fetchPass("login");
           Returns <u>encrypted</u> password if succeeds.  Returns 0 if login is invalid.  Returns undef otherwise.

       fetchInfo("login");
           Returns additional information if succeeds.  Returns 0 if login is invalid.  Returns undef otherwise.

       <b>fetchUsers()</b>;
           Will return either a list of all the user names, or a count of all the users.

           The following will return a list: my @users = $Htpasswd-&gt;<b>fetchUsers()</b>;

           The following will return the count: my $user_count = $Htpasswd-&gt;<b>fetchUsers()</b>;

       writeInfo("login", "info");
           Will replace the additional information for the login.  Returns 0 if login is invalid.  Returns undef
           otherwise.

       CryptPasswd("password", "salt");
           Will return an encrypted password using 'crypt'. If <u>salt</u> is omitted, a salt will be created.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       You install Apache::Htpasswd, as you would install any perl module library, by running these commands:

          perl Makefile.PL
          make
          make test
          make install
          make clean

       If you are going to use MD5 encrypted passwords, you need to install Crypt::PasswdMD5.

       If you need to support SHA1 encrypted passwords, you need to install Digest::SHA and MIME::Base64.

</pre><h4><b>DOCUMENTATION</b></h4><pre>
       POD  style  documentation  is  included  in the module.  These are normally converted to manual pages and
       installed as part of the "make install" process.  You should also be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to
       extract and read documentation from the module files directly.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The latest version of Apache::Htpasswd should always be available from:

           $CPAN/modules/by-authors/id/K/KM/KMELTZ/

       without first checking old password. IF YOU DON'T READ THE DOCS AND SEE I DID THIS DON'T EMAIL ME!
