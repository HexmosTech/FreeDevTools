       Net::Ident - lookup the username on the remote end of a TCP/IP connection

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Net::Ident;

        $username = Net::Ident::lookup(SOCKET, $timeout);

        $username = Net::Ident::lookupFromInAddr($localsockaddr,
                                                  $remotesockaddr, $timeout);

        $obj = Net::Ident-&gt;new(SOCKET, $timeout);
        $obj = Net::Ident-&gt;newFromInAddr($localsockaddr, $remotesockaddr,
                                               $timeout);
        $status = $obj-&gt;query;
        $status = $obj-&gt;ready;
        $username = $obj-&gt;username;
        ($username, $opsys, $error) = $obj-&gt;username;
        $fh = $obj-&gt;getfh;
        $txt = $obj-&gt;geterror;

        use Net::Ident 'ident_lookup';

        $username = ident_lookup(SOCKET, $timeout);

        use Net::Ident 'lookupFromInAddr';

        $username = lookupFromInAddr($localsockaddr, $remotesockaddr, $timeout);

        use Net::Ident ':fh';

        $username = SOCKET-&gt;ident_lookup($timeout);

        use Net::Ident ':apache';

        # my Apache $r;
        $c = $r-&gt;connection;
        $username = $c-&gt;ident_lookup($timeout);

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Net::Ident</b> is a module that looks up the username on the remote side of a TCP/IP connection through the
       ident (auth/tap) protocol described in RFC1413 (which supersedes RFC931). Note that this requires the
       remote site to run a daemon (often called <b>identd</b>) to provide the requested information, so it is not
       always available for all TCP/IP connections.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You can either use the simple interface, which does one ident lookup at a time, or use the asynchronous
       interface to perform (possibly) many simultaneous lookups, or simply continue serving other things while
       the lookup is proceeding.

   <b>Simple</b> <b>Interface</b>
       The simple interface comes in four varieties. An object oriented method call of a FileHandle object, an
       object oriented method of an Apache::Connection object, and as one of two different simple subroutine
       calls. Other than the calling method, these routines behave exactly the same.

       "Net::Ident::lookup (SOCKET" [", $timeout"]")"
           <b>Net::Ident::lookup</b>  is  an  exportable  function.  However,  due  to  the  generic name of the <b>lookup</b>
           function, it is recommended that you instead import the alias function <b>Net::Ident::ident_lookup</b>. Both
           functions are exported through @EXPORT_OK, so you'll have to explicitly ask for it if  you  want  the
           function <b>ident_lookup</b> to be callable from your program.

           You  can  pass  the  socket  using either a string, which doesn't have to be qualified with a package
           name, or using the more modern FileHandle calling styles: as a glob or as a reference to a glob.  The
           Socket  has to be a connected TCP/IP socket, ie. something which is either <b>connect()</b>ed or <b>accept()</b>ed.
           The optional timeout parameter specifies a timeout in seconds. If you do not specify  a  timeout,  or
           use  a  value  of  undef,  there  will be no timeout (apart from any default system timeouts like TCP
           connection timeouts).

       "Net::Ident::lookupFromInAddr ($localaddr, $remoteaddr" [", $timeout"]")"
           <b>Net::Ident::lookupFromInAddr</b> is an exportable function (via @EXPORT_OK).  The arguments are the local
           and remote address  of  a  connection,  in  packed  ``sockaddr''  format  (the  kind  of  thing  that
           "getsockname"  returns).  The  optional  timeout  value  specifies a timeout in seconds, see also the
           description of the timeout value in the "Net::Ident::lookup" section above.

           The given localaddr <b>must</b> have the IP address of a local interface of the machine you're calling  this
           on, otherwise an error will occur.

           You  can  use this function whenever you have a local and remote socket address, but no direct access
           to the socket itself. For example, because you are parsing the output  of  "netstat"  and  extracting
           socket address, or because you are writing a mod_perl script under apache (in that case, also see the
           Apache::Connection method below).

       "ident_lookup SOCKET" [$timeout]
           When  you import the ``magic'' tag ':fh' using "use Net::Ident ':fh';", the <b>Net::Ident</b> module extends
           the <b>FileHandle</b> class with one extra  method  call,  <b>ident_lookup</b>.  It  assumes  that  the  object  (a
           FileHandle)  it  is  operating  on,  is  a  connected  TCP/IP  socket,  ie. something which is either
           <b>connect()</b>ed or <b>accept()</b>ed. The optional parameter specifies the timeout in  seconds,  just  like  the
           timeout parameter of the function calls above.

           Adding  the  <b>ident_lookup</b>  method to the <b>FileHandle</b> class used to be automatic in previous version of
           <b>Net::Ident</b>. During the installation of this <b>Net::Ident</b> package, the system  administrator  choose  to
           install  it  in  a  compatible  way,  meaning  that  on  this  machine,  the  <b>ident_lookup</b>  method is
           automatically added if you use just "use Net::Ident;"

           Some people do not like the way that ``proper'' object design is broken by  letting  one  module  add
           methods  to  another  class.  This is why, starting from version 1.20, you have to explicitly ask for
           this behaviour to occur.  Personally, I this it's  a  compromise:  if  you  want  an  object-oriented
           interface,  then  either  you  make a derived class, like a FileHandleThatCanPerformIdentLookups, and
           make sure all appropriate internal functions get wrappers that do the necessary re-blessing. Or,  you
           simply  extend  the  FileHandle class. And since Perl doesn't object to this (pun intended :), I find
           this an acceptable solution. But you might think otherwise.

       "ident_lookup Apache::Connection" [$timeout]
           When you import the ``magic'' tag ':apache' using "use Net::Ident ':apache';", the <b>Net::Ident</b>  module
           extends  the <b>Apache::Connection</b> class with one extra method call, <b>ident_lookup</b>. This method takes one
           optional parameter: a timeout value in seconds.

           This is a similar convenience function as  the  FileHandle::ident_lookup  method,  to  be  used  with
           mod_perl scripts under Apache.

       What these functions return depends on the context:

       scalar context
           In  scalar context, these functions return the remote username on success, or undef on error. "Error"
           is rather broad, it might mean: some network error occurred,  function  arguments  are  invalid,  the
           remote  site  is not responding (in time) or is not running an ident daemon, or the remote site ident
           daemon says there's no user connected with that particular connection.

           More precisely, the functions return whatever the remote daemon specified as the ID that  belongs  to
           that  particular  connection. This is often the username, but it doesn't necessarily have to be. Some
           sites, out of privacy and/or security measures, return an opaque ID that is unique for each user, but
           is not identical to the username.  See <u>RFC1413</u> for more information.

       array context
           In array context, these functions return: "($username, $opsys, $error)".  The <u>$username</u> is the remote
           username or ID, as returned in the scalar context, or undef on error.

           The <u>$opsys</u> is the remote operating system as reported by the remote  ident  daemon,  or  undef  on  a
           network error, or <b>"ERROR"</b> when the remote ident daemon reported an error. This could also contain the
           character set of the returned username. See RFC1413.

           The  <u>$error</u> is the error message, either the error reported by the remote ident daemon (in which case
           <u>$opsys</u> is <b>"ERROR"</b>), or the internal message from the <b>Net::Ident</b> module,  which  includes  the  system
           errno  $!  whenever  possible.  A likely candidate is <b>"Connection</b> <b>refused"</b> when the remote site isn't
           running an ident daemon, or  <b>"Connection</b>  <b>timed</b>  <b>out"</b>  when  the  remote  site  isn't  answering  our
           connection request.

           When <u>$username</u> has a value, <u>$error</u> is always undef, and vice versa.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       The  following  code  is a complete example, implementing a server that waits for a connection on a port,
       tells you who you are and what time it is, and closes the connection again. The majority of the code will
       look very familiar if you just read perlipc.

       Excersize this server by telnetting to it, preferably from a machine that has  a  suitable  ident  daemon
       installed.

           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a> -w

           use Net::Ident;
           # uncomment the below line if you want lots of debugging info
           # $Net::Ident::DEBUG = 2;
           use Socket;
           use strict;

           sub logmsg { print "$0 $$: @_ at ", scalar localtime, "\n" }

           my $port = shift || 2345;
           my $proto = getprotobyname('tcp');
           socket(Server, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, $proto) or die "socket: $!";
           setsockopt(Server, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, pack("l", 1)) or
             die "setsockopt: $!";
           bind(Server, sockaddr_in($port, INADDR_ANY)) or die "bind: $!";
           listen(Server,SOMAXCONN) or die "listen: $!";

           logmsg "server started on port $port";

           my $paddr;

           for ( ; $paddr = accept(Client,Server); close Client) {
               my($port,$iaddr) = sockaddr_in($paddr);
               my $name = gethostbyaddr($iaddr,AF_INET) || inet_ntoa($iaddr);
               logmsg "connection from $name [" . inet_ntoa($iaddr) .
                 "] at port $port";

               my $username = Client-&gt;<a href="../man30/ident_lookup.30.html">ident_lookup</a>(30) || "~unknown";
               logmsg "User at $name:$port is $username";

               print Client "Hello there, $username\@$name, it's now ",
                  scalar localtime, "\n";
           }

   <b>Asynchronous</b> <b>Interface</b>
       The  asynchronous  interface  is  meant  for  those  who  know the ins and outs of the select() call (the
       4-argument version of select(), but I didn't need saying that, did  I?).  This  interface  is  completely
       object oriented. The following methods are available:

       "new Net::Ident SOCKET, $timeout"
           This constructs a new Net::Ident object, and initiates the connection to the remote ident daemon. The
           parameters are the same as described above for the <b>Net::Ident::lookup</b> subroutine. This method returns
           immediately, the supplied <u>$timeout</u> is only stored in the object and used in future methods.

           If  you  want to implement your own timeout, that's fine. Simply throw away the object when you don't
           want it anymore.

           The constructor will always succeed. When it detects an error, however, it  returns  an  object  that
           "has  already  failed"  internally.  In  this  case,  all  methods will return "undef" except for the
           "geterror" method, wich will return the error message.

           The timeout is <u>not</u> implemented using alarm(). In fact you can use alarm() completely  independent  of
           this library, they do not interfere.

       "newFromInAddr $localaddr, $remoteaddr, $timeout"
           Alternative  constructor,  that  takes two packed sockaddr structures. Otherwise behaves identical to
           the "new" constructor above.

       "query $obj"
           This object method queries the remote rfc931 daemon, and blocks until the  connection  to  the  ident
           daemon  is  writable, if necessary (but you are supposed to make sure it is, of course). Returns true
           on success (or rather it returns the <u>$obj</u> itself), or undef on error.

       "ready $obj" [$blocking]
           This object method returns whether the data received from the remote  daemon  is  complete  (true  or
           false).  Returns undef on error. Reads any data from the connection.  If <u>$blocking</u> is true, it blocks
           and waits until all data is received (it never returns false when blocking  is  true,  only  true  or
           undef). If <u>$blocking</u> is not true, it doesn't block at all (unless... see below).

           If  you  didn't  call  "query  $obj"  yet,  this  method  calls it for you, which means it <u>can</u> block,
           regardless of the value of <u>$blocking</u>, depending on whether the connection to the ident is writable.

           Obviously, you are supposed to call this routine whenever you see that the connection  to  the  ident
           daemon is readable, and act appropriately when this returns true.

           Note that once <b>ready</b> returns true, there are no longer checks on timeout (because the networking part
           of  the  lookup  is  over  anyway).   This means that even "ready $obj" can return true way after the
           timeout has expired, provided it returned true at least once before the timeout expired. This  is  to
           be construed as a feature.

       "username $obj"
           This  object  method  parses  the  return from the remote ident daemon, and blocks until the query is
           complete, if necessary (it effectively calls "ready $obj 1" for you if you didn't  do  it  yourself).
           Returns the parsed username on success, or undef on error. In an array context, the return values are
           the same as described for the <b>Net::Ident::lookup</b> subroutine.

       "getfh $obj"
           This  object  method  returns  the  internal  FileHandle  used for the connection to the remote ident
           daemon. Invaluable if you want it to dance in your <b>select()</b> ring. Returns undef  when  an  error  has
           occurred.

       "geterror $obj"
           This  object  method  returns  the  error message in case there was an error. undef when there was no
           error.

       An asynchronous example implementing the above server in a multi-threaded way via select, is left  as  an
       excersize for the interested reader.

       program under the same terms as Perl itself.

</pre><h4><b>REVISION</b> <b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       V1.20
           August 2, 1999. Finally implemented the long-asked-for lookupFromInAddr method. Other changes:

           •
            No longer imports ident_lookup into package FileHandle by default, unless you explicitly ask for  it
            (or unless you installed it that way during compile time for compatibility reasons).

           •
            Allow  adding  an ident_lookup method to the Apache::Connection class, as a convenience for mod_perl
            script writers.

           •
            Rewritten tests, included test for the Apache::Connection method by actually  launching  apache  and
            performing ident lookups from within mod_perl.

           •
            Moved  selection  of  FileHandle/IO::Handle  class out of the Makefile.PL.  PAUSE/CPAN didn't really
            like modules that weren't present in the distribution, and it didn't allow you to upgrade your  perl
            version underneath.

       V1.11
           Jan 15th, 1997. Several bugfixes, and some slight interface changes:

           •
            constructor now called "new" instead of "initconnect", constructor now always succeeds, if something
            has  gone  wrong in the constructor, all methods return undef (like "getfh"), except for "geterror",
            which returns the error message.

           •
            The recommended exported function is now "ident_lookup" instead of "lookup"

           •
            Fixed a bug: now chooses O_NDELAY or O_NONBLOCK from %Config, instead of hardcoding O_NDELAY (argh)

           •
            Adding a method to FileHandle would break in perl5.004, it should get  added  in  IO::Handle.  Added
            intelligence in Makefile.PL to detect that and choose the appropriate package.

           •
            Miscellaneous pod fixes.

           •
            Test script now actually tests multiple different things.

       V1.10
           Jan 11th, 1997. Complete rewrite for perl5. Requires perl5.002 or up.

       V1.02
           Jan  20th,  1995.  Quite  a  big  bugfix:  "connection refused" to the ident port would kill the perl
           process with a SIGPIPE if the connect didn't immediately signal  it  (ie.  almost  always  on  remote
           machines). Also recognises the perl5 package separator :: now on fully qualified descriptors. This is
           still  perl4-compatible,  a perl5- only version would require a rewrite to make it neater.  Fixed the
           constants normally found in .ph files (but you shouldn't use those anyway).

           [this release wasn't called <b>Net::Ident</b>, of course, it was called <b>rfc931.pl</b>]

       V1.01
           Around November 1994. Removed a spurious <b>perl5</b> <b>-w</b> complaint. First public release.  Has  been  tested
           against <b>perl</b> <b>5.000</b> and <b>perl</b> <b>4.036</b>.

       V1.00
           Dunno, somewhere 1994. First neat collection of dusty routines put in a package.
