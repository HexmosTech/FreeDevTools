</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       RT::Extension::ResetPassword - add "forgot your password?" link to RT instance

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This extension for RT adds a new "Forgot your password?" link to the front of your RT instance. Any user
       can request that RT send them a password reset token by email.  RT will send the user a one-time URL
       which he or she can use to reset her password.

       It also adds a new option to the user admin page in RT for the RT admin to send a password reset email
       for new users or users who have forgotten their passwords. See below for options to enable this admin
       feature only and disable self-service features.

</pre><h4><b>RT</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Works with RT 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, 5.0

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       "perl Makefile.PL"
       "make"
       "make install"
           May need root permissions

       "make initdb"
           Only run this the first time you install this module.

           If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your database.

           If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions in case changes need to be made to
           your database.

       Edit your <u>/opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm</u>
           If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

               Plugin('RT::Extension::ResetPassword');

           For RT 4.0, add this line:

               Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::ResetPassword));

           or add "RT::Extension::ResetPassword" to your existing @Plugins line.

       Clear your mason cache
               rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

       Restart your webserver

</pre><h4><b>UPGRADING</b></h4><pre>
       If  you are upgrading from version 0.05, you will need to run "make initdb" as documented in INSTALLATION
       to install the Template used by this Extension.

       To run on RT 4.0 or 4.2, replace this line in the template:

           { RT::Interface::Web::RequestENV('REMOTE_ADDR') }

       with this:

           { $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'} }

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       This extension resets passwords managed by RT. It cannot reset passwords for RTs that use any  configured
       external  auth  such  as  SAML,  OAuth,  LDAP,  or  Active  Directory  as RT does not have password reset
       connections in those external systems.

       The contents of the email sent to users can be found in the global PasswordReset template (do not confuse
       this with the core PasswordChange template).

       If you want to prevent unauthorized visitors from determining what user accounts exist and  whether  they
       are  disabled, set HidePasswordResetErrors to 1 in your RT configuration; then any password reset request
       will appear to the requestor to have resulted in an email being sent, thus not revealing the reasons  for
       any failure. All failures will still be logged with an appropriate diagnostic message.

       For  an  RT open to the internet the most secure configuration is to use the default configuration ( This
       means setting no config options from below ). The default configuration only allows  for  existing  users
       with an existing password to reset their password.

       If the rights schema for the RT is tight then it could be desirable to allow users who have a user record
       in  RT  (  They  have  emailed RT before ) but no password to create a password for themselves by setting
       $AllowUsersWithoutPassword to 1. This can allow for any user to access the RT self  service  pages.  This
       can  be  dangerous  if  the RT rights are not set-up correctly as users could see data they should not be
       able to.

       The $CreateNewUserAndSetPassword and $CreateNewUserAsPrivileged config options should only be  used  when
       access  to  the RT web UI is limited.  This usually means access to the web UI is restricted so that only
       users on the company network can access the UI and create new user records.

       $AllowUsersWithoutPassword
           Setting this config option to true will allow existing users who do not have a password set  to  send
           themselves a reset password email and set a password.

       $CreateNewUserAsPrivileged
           Set this config value to true if users creating a new account should default to privileged users.

           <b>WARNING</b>  Setting  this  to true can be dangerous as it allows anyone to create a new privileged user.
           Usually privileged users are given rights to edit and see information not desired to be public.

       $CreateNewUserAndSetPassword
           This configuration option determines if a nonexistent user can create a new user record.

           <b>WARNING</b> See the note about the danger of setting this to true and setting  $CreateNewUserAsPrivileged
           to true as well.

       $DisableResetPasswordOnLogin
           Set this config value to true if you do not want the "forgot password" option to display on the login
           page.

           This  is  useful  if  you want only the password reset email option on the RT user admin page, but no
           self-service options.
