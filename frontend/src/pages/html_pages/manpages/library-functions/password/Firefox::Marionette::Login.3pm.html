</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Firefox::Marionette::Login - Represents a login from the Firefox Password Manager

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 1.22

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Firefox::Marionette();
           use v5.10;

           my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette-&gt;new();
           foreach my $login ($firefox-&gt;logins()) {
               if ($login-&gt;user() eq '<a href="mailto:me@example.org">me@example.org</a>') {
                   ...
               }
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module handles the implementation of a login &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
       US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsILoginInfo&gt; from the Firefox Password Manager
       &lt;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-edit-logins&gt;

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES/METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>creation_time</b>
       returns the time, in Unix Epoch seconds, when the login was first created.

   <b>creation_in_ms</b>
       returns the time, in Unix Epoch milliseconds, when the login was first created.  This is the same time as
       creation_in_ms but divided by 1000 and turned back into an integer.

   <b>guid</b>
       returns the GUID to uniquely identify the login.

   <b>host</b>
       returns the scheme + hostname (for example "https://example.com") of the page containing the login form.

   <b>last_used_time</b>
       returns the time, in Unix Epoch seconds, when the login was last submitted in a form or used to begin an
       HTTP auth session.  This is the same time as last_used_in_ms but divided by 1000 and turned back into an
       integer.

   <b>last_used_in_ms</b>
       returns the time, in Unix Epoch milliseconds, when the login was last submitted in a form or used to
       begin an HTTP auth session.

   <b>origin</b>
       returns the scheme + hostname (for example "https://example.org") of the action
       &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#attr-action&gt; attribute of the form that
       is being submitted.

   <b>new</b>
       accepts an optional hash as a parameter.  Allowed keys are below;

       •   creation_in_ms - the time, in Unix Epoch milliseconds, when the login was first created.

       •   creation_time  -  the time, in Unix Epoch seconds, when the login was first created.  This value will
           be overridden by the more precise creation_in_ms parameter, if provided.

       •   guid - the GUID to uniquely identify the login. This can be any arbitrary string,  but  a  format  as
           created              by              nsIUUIDGenerator              &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
           US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsIUUIDGenerator&gt;   is   recommended.   For   example,
           "{d4e1a1f6-5ea0-40ee-bff5-da57982f21cf}".

       •   host  -  this is the scheme + hostname (for example "https://example.com") of the page containing the
           login form.

       •   last_used_in_ms returns the time, in Unix Epoch milliseconds, when the login was last submitted in  a
           form or used to begin an HTTP auth session.

       •   last_used_time - the time, in Unix Epoch seconds, when the login was last submitted in a form or used
           to  begin  an  HTTP  auth session.  This value will be overridden by the more precise last_used_in_ms
           parameter, if provided.

       •   origin  -  this  is  the  scheme  +  hostname  (for  example  "https://example.org")  of  the  action
           &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#attr-action&gt;  attribute  of  the form
           that    is     being     submitted.      If     the     action     &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
           US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#attr-action&gt;  attribute  has  an empty or relative URL, then this value
           should be the same as the host.  If this value is ignored,  it  will  apply  for  forms  with  action
           &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#attr-action&gt; of all values.

       •   password - the password for the login.

       •   password_changed_in_ms  -  the  time,  in Unix Epoch milliseconds, when the login's password was last
           modified.

       •   password_changed_time -  the time, in  Unix  Epoch  seconds,  when  the  login's  password  was  last
           modified.   This  value  will  be overridden by the more precise password_changed_in_ms parameter, if
           provided.

       •   password_field           -           the           name            &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
           US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#htmlattrdefname&gt;  attribute for the password input in a form.  This is
           ignored for http auth logins.

       •   realm - the HTTP Realm for which the login was requested.  This is ignored for HTML Form logins.

       •   times_used - the number of times the login was submitted in a form or used  to  begin  an  HTTP  auth
           session.

       •   user - the user name for the login.

       •   user_field             -            the            name            &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
           US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#htmlattrdefname&gt; attribute for the user input  in  a  form.   This  is
           ignored for http auth logins.

       This method returns a new "Firefox::Marionette::Login" object.

   <b>password</b>
       returns the password for the login.

   <b>password_changed_time</b>
       returns  the  time, in Unix Epoch seconds, when the login's password was last modified.  This is the same
       time as password_changed_in_ms but divided by 1000 and turned back into an integer.

   <b>password_changed_in_ms</b>
       returns the time, in Unix Epoch milliseconds, when the login's password was last modified.

   <b>password_field</b>
       returns   the   name    &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#htmlattrdefname&gt;
       attribute for the password input in a form or undef for non-form logins.

   <b>realm</b>
       returns  the  HTTP  Realm  for which the login was requested. When an HTTP server sends a 401 result, the
       WWW-Authenticate header includes a realm to identify the "protection space." See RFC 2617. If the  result
       did  not  include  a  realm, or it was blank, the hostname is used instead. For logins obtained from HTML
       forms, this field is null.

   <b>times_used</b>
       returns the number of times the login was submitted in a form or used to begin an HTTP auth session.

   <b>user</b>
       returns the user name for the login.

   <b>user_field</b>
       returns   the   name    &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#htmlattrdefname&gt;
       attribute for the user input in a form or undef for non-form logins.
