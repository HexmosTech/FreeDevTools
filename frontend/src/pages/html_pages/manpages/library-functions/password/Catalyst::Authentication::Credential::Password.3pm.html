</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::Password - Authenticate a user with a password.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Catalyst qw/
             Authentication
             /;

           package MyApp::Controller::Auth;

           sub login : Local {
               my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

               $c-&gt;authenticate( { username =&gt; $c-&gt;req-&gt;param('username'),
                                   password =&gt; $c-&gt;req-&gt;param('password') });
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This authentication credential checker takes authentication information (most often a username) and a
       password, and attempts to validate the password provided against the user retrieved from the store.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
           # example
           __PACKAGE__-&gt;config('Plugin::Authentication' =&gt;
                       {
                           default_realm =&gt; 'members',
                           realms =&gt; {
                               members =&gt; {

                                   credential =&gt; {
                                       class =&gt; 'Password',
                                       password_field =&gt; 'password',
                                       password_type =&gt; 'hashed',
                                       password_hash_type =&gt; 'SHA-1'
                                   },
                                   ...

       The password module is capable of working with several different password encryption/hashing algorithms.
       The one the module uses is determined by the credential configuration.

       Those who have used Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication prior to the 0.10 release should note that the
       password field and type information is no longer part of the store configuration and is now part of the
       Password credential configuration.

       class
           The classname used for Credential. This is part of Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication and is the method
           by  which  Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::Password  is loaded as the credential validator. For
           this module to be used, this must be set to 'Password'.

       password_field
           The field in the user object that contains the password. This will  vary  depending  on  the  storage
           class  used, but is most likely something like 'password'. In fact, this is so common that if this is
           left out of the config, it defaults to 'password'. This field is obtained from the user object  using
           the  <b>get()</b>  method.  Essentially:  $user-&gt;get('passwordfieldname');  <b>NOTE</b>  If  the  password_field is
           something other than 'password', you  must  be  sure  to  use  that  same  field  name  when  calling
           $c-&gt;<b>authenticate()</b>.

       password_type
           This  sets the password type.  Often passwords are stored in crypted or hashed formats.  In order for
           the password module to verify the plaintext password passed in, it  must  be  told  what  format  the
           password will be in when it is retrieved from the user object. The supported options are:

           none    No  password  check is done. An attempt is made to retrieve the user based on the information
                   provided in the $c-&gt;<b>authenticate()</b> call. If a user is found, authentication is considered  to
                   be successful.

           clear   The password in user is in clear text and will be compared directly.

           self_check
                   This  option  indicates that the password should be passed to the <b>check_password()</b> routine on
                   the user object returned from the store.

           crypted The password in user is in UNIX crypt hashed format.

           salted_hash
                   The password in user is in salted hash format, and will be validated using Crypt::SaltedHash.
                   If this password type is selected, you  should  also  provide  the  <b>password_salt_len</b>  config
                   element to define the salt length.

           hashed  If  the  user object supports hashed passwords, they will be used in conjunction with Digest.
                   The following config elements affect the hashed configuration:

                   password_hash_type
                           The hash type used, passed directly to "new" in Digest.

                   password_pre_salt
                           Any pre-salt data to be passed to "add" in Digest before processing the password.

                   password_post_salt
                           Any post-salt data to be passed to "add" in Digest after processing the password.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The Password credential module is very simple to use. Once configured as indicated above,  authenticating
       using this module is simply a matter of calling $c-&gt;<b>authenticate()</b> with an authinfo hashref that includes
       the  <b>password</b>  element.  The  password  element  should  contain  the password supplied by the user to be
       authenticated, in clear text. The other information supplied in the auth hash is ignored by the  Password
       module, and simply passed to the auth store to be used to retrieve the user. An example call follows:

           if ($c-&gt;authenticate({ username =&gt; $username,
                                  password =&gt; $password} )) {
               # authentication successful
           } else {
               # authentication failed
           }

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  no  publicly exported routines in the Password module (or indeed in most credential modules.)
       However, below is a description of the routines  required  by  Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication  for  all
       credential modules.

   <b>new(</b> <b>$config,</b> <b>$app,</b> <b>$realm</b> <b>)</b>
       Instantiate  a  new  Password object using the configuration hash provided in $config. A reference to the
       application is provided as the second argument.  Note to  credential  module  authors:  <b>new()</b>  is  called
       during  the  application's  plugin  setup phase, which is before the application specific controllers are
       loaded. The practical upshot of this is that things like $c-&gt;model(...) will not function as expected.

   <b>authenticate(</b> <b>$authinfo,</b> <b>$c</b> <b>)</b>
       Try to log a user in, receives a hashref containing authentication information as the first argument, and
       the current context as the second.

   <b>check_password(</b> <b>)</b>
