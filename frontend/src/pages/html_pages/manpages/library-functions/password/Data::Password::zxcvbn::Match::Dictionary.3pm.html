</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Data::Password::zxcvbn::Match::Dictionary - match class for words in passwords

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.1.2

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class represents the guess that a certain substring of a password can be guessed by going through a
       dictionary.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"reversed"</b>
       Boolean, true if the token appears to be a dictionary word that's been reversed (i.e. last letter first)

   <b>"substitutions"</b>
       Hashref representing the characters that need to be substituted to make the token match a dictionary work
       (e.g. if the token is "s!mpl3", this hash would be "{ '!' =&gt; 'i', '3' =&gt; 'e' }").

   <b>"rank"</b>
       Number, indicating how common the dictionary word is. 1 means "most common".

   <b>"dictionary_name"</b>
       String, the name of the dictionary that the word was found in. Usually one of:

       •   "english_wikipedia"

           words extracted from a dump of the English edition of Wikipedia

       •   "male_names", "female_names", "surnames"

           common names from the 1990 US census

       •   "passwords"

           most common passwords, extracted from the "xato" password dump

       •   "us_tv_and_film"

           words from a 2006 Wiktionary word frequency study over American television and movies

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"l33t"</b>
       Returns true if the token had any "substitutions" (i.e. it was written in "l33t-speak")

   <b>"make"</b>
         my @matches = @{ Data::Password::zxcvbn::Match::Dictionary-&gt;make(
           $password,
           { # these are the defaults
             ranked_dictionaries =&gt; \%Data::Password::zxcvbn::RankedDictionaries::ranked_dictionaries,
             l33t_table =&gt; \%Data::Password::zxcvbn::Match::Dictionary::l33t_table,
           },
         ) };

       Scans  the  $password  for  substrings  that match words in the "ranked_dictionaries", possibly reversed,
       possibly with substitutions from the "l33t_table".

       The "ranked_dictionaries" should look like:

         { some_dictionary_name =&gt; { 'word' =&gt; 156, 'another' =&gt; 13, ... },
           ... }

       (i.e. a hash of dictionaries, each mapping words to their frequency rank)  and  the  "l33t_table"  should
       look like:

         { a =&gt; [ '4', '@' ], ... }

       (i.e. a hash mapping characters to arrays of other characters)

   <b>"estimate_guesses"</b>
       The  number  of  guesses is the product of the rank of the word, how many case combinations match it, how
       many substitutions were used, doubled if the token is reversed.

   <b>"does_word_start_upper"</b>
   <b>"does_word_end_upper"</b>
   <b>"is_word_all_not_upper"</b>
   <b>"is_word_all_not_lower"</b>
   <b>"is_word_all_upper"</b>
         if ($self-&gt;does_word_start_upper($word)) { ... }

       These are mainly for sub-classes, to use in ""feedback_warning"" and ""feedback_suggestions"".

   <b>"feedback_warning"</b>
   <b>"feedback_suggestions"</b>
       This class suggests not using common words or passwords, especially on their own. It also  suggests  that
       capitalisation, "special characters" substitutions, and writing things backwards are not very useful.

   <b>"fields_for_json"</b>
       The  JSON  serialisation  for  matches  of  this  class  will  contain  "token  i j guesses guesses_log10
       dictionary_name reversed rank substitutions".
