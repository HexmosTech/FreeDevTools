</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::Threads - Interpreter-based threads are officially discouraged

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Perl interpreter threads are officially discouraged. They were created to emulate fork() in Windows
       environments, and are not fast or lightweight as one may expect. Non-blocking code or I/O can be easily
       parallelized by using an event loop such as POE, IO::Async, or Mojo::IOLoop. Blocking code is usually
       better parallelized by forking, which on Unix-like systems is fast and efficient. Modules such as forks
       and Parallel::Prefork can make forking easier to work with, as well as forking modules for event loops
       such as POE::Wheel::Run, IO::Async::Process, or "subprocess" in Mojo::IOLoop.

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy is part of Perl::Critic::Community.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy is not configurable except for the standard options.
