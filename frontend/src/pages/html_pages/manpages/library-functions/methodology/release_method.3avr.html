</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       release_method - Release Numbering and Methodology

</pre><h4><b>Release</b> <b>Version</b> <b>Numbering</b> <b>Scheme</b></h4><pre>
       Release numbers consist of three parts, a major number, a minor number, and a revision number, each
       separated by a dot.

       The major number is currently 2, to indicate the multilib layout has been adapted to the fairly different
       one used starting with AVR-GCC version 5. Nevertheless, it is still believed to be generally API-
       compatible with release versions 1.x.

       In the past (up to 1.6.x), even minor numbers have been used to indicate 'stable' releases, and odd minor
       numbers have been reserved for development branches/versions. As the latter has never really been used,
       and maintaining a stable branch that eventually became effectively the same as the development version
       has proven to be just a cumbersome and tedious job, this scheme has given up in early 2010, so starting
       with 1.7.0, every minor number will be used. Minor numbers will be bumped upon judgement of the
       development team, whenever it seems appropriate, but at least in cases where some API was changed.

       Starting with version 1.4.0, a file &lt;<b>avr/version.h</b>&gt; indicates the library version of an installed library
       tree.

       <b>Note</b>
           In what follows, I assume you know how to use SVN and how to checkout multiple source trees in a
           single directory without having them clobber each other. If you don't know how to do this, you
           probably shouldn't be making releases or cutting branches.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>an</b> <b>SVN</b> <b>branch</b>
       The following steps should be taken to cut a branch in SVN (assuming $username is set to your savannah
       username):

       1.  Check out a fresh source tree from SVN trunk.

       2.  Update the NEWS file with pending release number and commit to SVN trunk:
            Change <u>Changes</u> <u>since</u> <u>avr-libc-&lt;last_release&gt;:</u> to <u>Changes</u> <u>in</u> <u>avr-libc-&lt;this_relelase&gt;</u>.

       3.  Set the branch-point tag (setting &lt;major&gt; and &lt;minor&gt; accordingly):
            svn                  copy                 svn+ssh://$<a href="mailto:username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org">username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org</a>/avr-libc/trunk
           svn+ssh://$<a href="mailto:username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org">username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org</a>/avr-libc/tags/avr-libc-&lt;<u>major</u>&gt;_&lt;<u>minor</u>&gt;-branchpoint

       4.  Create the branch:
            svn                 copy                  svn+ssh://$<a href="mailto:username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org">username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org</a>/avr-libc/trunk
           svn+ssh://$<a href="mailto:username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org">username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org</a>/avr-libc/branches/avr-libc-&lt;<u>major</u>&gt;_&lt;<u>minor</u>&gt;-branch

       5.  Update the package version in configure.ac and commit configure.ac to SVN trunk:
            Change minor number to next odd value.

       6.  Update the NEWS file and commit to SVN trunk:
            Add <u>Changes</u> <u>since</u> <u>avr-libc-&lt;this_release&gt;:</u>

       7.  Check out a new tree for the branch:
            svn co svn+ssh://$<a href="mailto:username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org">username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org</a>/avr-libc/branches/avr-libc-&lt;<u>major</u>&gt;_&lt;<u>minor</u>&gt;-branch

       8.  Update the package version in configure.ac and commit configure.ac to SVN branch:
            Change  the  patch number to 90 to denote that this now a branch leading up to a release. Be sure to
           leave the &lt;date&gt; part of the version.

       9.  Bring the build system up to date by running bootstrap and configure.

       10. Perform a 'make distcheck' and make sure it succeeds. This will create the snapshot  source  tarball.
           This should be considered the first release candidate.

       11. Upload the snapshot tarball to savannah.

       12. Update  the  bug  tracker  interface  on  Savannah:  Bugs ---&gt; Edit field values ---&gt; Release / Fixed
           Release

       13. Announce the branch and the branch tag to the avr-libc-dev list so other developers can checkout  the
           branch.

   <b>Making</b> <b>a</b> <b>release</b>
       A stable release will only be done on a branch, not from the SVN trunk.

       The following steps should be taken when making a release:

       1.  Make sure the source tree you are working from is on the correct branch:
            svn             switch            svn+ssh://$<a href="mailto:username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org">username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org</a>/avr-libc/branches/avr-
           libc-&lt;<u>major</u>&gt;_&lt;<u>minor</u>&gt;-branch

       2.  Update the package version in configure.ac and commit it to SVN.

       3.  Update the gnu tool chain version requirements in the README and commit to SVN.

       4.  Update the ChangeLog file to note the release and commit to SVN on the branch:
            Add <u>Released</u> <u>avr-libc-&lt;this_release&gt;.</u>

       5.  Update the NEWS file with pending release number and commit to SVN:
            Change <u>Changes</u> <u>since</u> <u>avr-libc-&lt;last_release&gt;:</u> to <u>Changes</u> <u>in</u> <u>avr-libc-&lt;this_relelase&gt;:</u>.

       6.  Bring the build system up to date by running bootstrap and configure.

       7.  Perform a 'make distcheck' and make sure it succeeds. This will create the source tarball.

       8.  Tag the release:
            svn          copy          .          svn+ssh://$<a href="mailto:username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org">username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org</a>/avr-libc/tags/avr-
           libc-&lt;<u>major</u>&gt;_&lt;<u>minor</u>&gt;_&lt;<u>patch</u>&gt;-release
            or
            svn              copy             svn+ssh://$<a href="mailto:username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org">username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org</a>/avr-libc/branches/avr-
           libc-&lt;<u>major</u>&gt;_&lt;<u>minor</u>&gt;-branch            svn+ssh://$<a href="mailto:username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org">username@svn.savannah.nongnu.org</a>/avr-libc/tags/avr-
           libc-&lt;<u>major</u>&gt;_&lt;<u>minor</u>&gt;_&lt;<u>patch</u>&gt;-release

       9.  Upload the tarball to savannah.

       10. Update the NEWS file, and commit to SVN:
            Add <u>Changes</u> <u>since</u> <u>avr-libc-&lt;major&gt;_&lt;minor&gt;_&lt;patch&gt;:</u>

       11. Update  the  bug  tracker  interface  on  Savannah:  Bugs ---&gt; Edit field values ---&gt; Release / Fixed
           Release

       12. Generate the latest documentation and upload to savannah.

       13. Announce the release.

       The following hypothetical diagram should help clarify version and branch relationships.
