</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis::soap - A SOAP-based access to the analysis tools

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Do not use this object directly, it is recommended to access it and use it through the
       "Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis" module:

         use Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis;
         my $tool = Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis-&gt;new(-access =&gt; 'soap',
                                                   -name   =&gt; 'seqret');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This object allows to execute and to control a remote analysis tool (an application, a program) using the
       SOAP middleware,

       All its public methods are documented in the interface module "Bio::AnalysisI" and explained in tutorial
       available in the "analysis.pl" script.

</pre><h4><b>APPENDIX</b></h4><pre>
       Here is the rest of the object methods.  Internal methods are preceded with an underscore _.

   <b>_initialize</b>
        Usage   : my $tool = Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis-&gt;new(-access =&gt; 'soap',
                                                            -name =&gt; 'seqret',
                                                            ...);
                  (_initialize is internally called from the 'new()' method)
        Returns : nothing interesting
        Args    : This module recognises and uses following arguments:
                    -location
                    -name
                    -httpproxy
                    -timeout
                  Additionally, the main module Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis
                  recognises also:
                    -access

       It populates calling object with the given arguments, and then - for some attributes and only if they are
       not yet populated - it assigns some default values.

       This is an actual <b>new()</b> method (except for the real object creation and its blessing which is done in the
       parent class Bio::Root::Root in method _create_object).

       Note  that  this  method  is  called  always as an <u>object</u> method (never as a <u>class</u> method) - and that the
       object who calls this  method  may  already  be  partly  initiated  (from  Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis::new
       method);  so  if  you need to do some tricks with the 'class invocation' you need to change Bio::Analysis
       <u>new</u> method, not this one.

       -location
           A URL (also called an <u>endpoint</u>) defining where is located a Web Service  representing  this  analysis
           tool.

           Default  is  "<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/soaplab/services">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/soaplab/services</a>"  (services  running  at  European Bioinformatics
           Institute on top of most of EMBOSS analyses, and few others).

           For example, if you run your own Web Service using Java(TM) Apache Axis toolkit, the  location  might
           be something like "<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:8080/axis/services".

       -name
           A name of a Web Service (also called a <u>urn</u> or a <u>namespace</u>).  There is no default value (which usually
           means  that  this  parameter is mandatory unless your <u>-location</u> parameter includes also a Web Service
           name).

       -destroy_on_exit =&gt; '0'
           Default value is '1' which  means  that  all  Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis::Job  objects  -  when  being
           finalised - will send a request to the remote Web Service to forget the results of these jobs.

           If  you  change  it to '0' make sure that you know the job identification - otherwise you will not be
           able to re-established connection with it (later, when you use your script again). This can  be  done
           by  calling  method  "id"  on  the  job  object  (such  object  is  returned by any of these methods:
           "create_job", "run", "wait_for").

       -httpproxy
           In addition to the <u>location</u> parameter, you may need to specify also a location/URL of an  HTTP  proxy
           server (if your site requires one). The expected format is "<a href="http://server">http://server</a>:port".  There is no default
           value.

       -timeout
           For  long(er)  running  jobs  the  HTTP connection may be time-outed. In order to avoid it (or, vice-
           versa, to call timeout sooner) you may specify "timeout" with the number of  seconds  the  connection
           will be kept alive. Zero means to keep it alive forever. The default value is two minutes.

   <b>is_binary</b>
         Usage   : if ($service-&gt;is_binary ('graph_result')) { ... }
         Returns : 1 or 0
         Args    : $name is a result name we are interested in

   <b>VERSION</b> <b>and</b> <b>Revision</b>
        Usage   : print $Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis::soap::VERSION;
                  print $Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis::soap::Revision;

   <b>Defaults</b>
        Usage   : print $Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis::soap::DEFAULT_LOCATION;
