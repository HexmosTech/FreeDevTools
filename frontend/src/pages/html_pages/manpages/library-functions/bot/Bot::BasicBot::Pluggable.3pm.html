</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable - extended simple IRC bot for pluggable modules

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.30

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Creating</b> <b>the</b> <b>bot</b> <b>module</b>
         # with all defaults.
         my $bot = Bot::BasicBot-&gt;new();

         # with useful options. pass any option
         # that's valid for Bot::BasicBot.
       my $bot = Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable-&gt;new(
           channels =&gt; ["#bottest"],
           server   =&gt; "irc.example.com",
           port     =&gt; "6667",

           nick      =&gt; "pluggabot",
           alt_nicks =&gt; ["pbot", "pluggable"],
           username  =&gt; "bot",
           name      =&gt; "Yet Another Pluggable Bot",

           ignore_list =&gt; [qw(hitherto blech muttley)],

       );

   <b>Running</b> <b>the</b> <b>bot</b> <b>(simple)</b>
       There's a shell script installed to run the bot.

         $ bot-basicbot-pluggable --nick MyBot --server irc.perl.org

       Then connect to the IRC server, /query the bot, and set a password. See
       Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Auth for further details.

   <b>Running</b> <b>the</b> <b>bot</b> <b>(advanced)</b>
       There are two useful ways to create a Pluggable bot. The simple way is:

         # Load some useful modules.
         my $infobot_module = $bot-&gt;load("Infobot");
         my $google_module  = $bot-&gt;load("Google");
         my $seen_module    = $bot-&gt;load("Seen");

         # Set the Google key (see <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/">http://www.google.com/apis/</a>).
         $google_module-&gt;set("google_key", "some google key");

         $bot-&gt;run();

       The above lets you run a bot with a few modules, but not change those modules during the run of the bot.
       The complex, but more flexible, way is as follows:

         # Load the Loader module.
         $bot-&gt;load('Loader');

         # run the bot.
         $bot-&gt;run();

       This is simpler but needs further setup once the bot is joined to a server. The Loader module lets you
       talk to the bot in-channel and tell it to load and unload other modules. The first one you'll want to
       load is the 'Auth' module, so that other people can't load and unload modules without permission. Then
       you'll need to log in as an admin and change the default password, per the following /query:

         !load Auth
         !auth admin julia
         !password julia new_password
         !auth admin new_password

       Once you've done this, your bot is safe from other IRC users, and you can tell it to load and unload
       other installed modules at any time. Further information on module loading is in
       Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Loader.

         !load Seen
         !load Google
         !load Join

       The Join module lets you tell the bot to join and leave channels:

         &lt;botname&gt;, join #mychannel
         &lt;botname&gt;, leave #someotherchannel

       The perldoc pages for the various modules will list other commands.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable started as Yet Another Infobot replacement, but now is a generalised framework
       for writing infobot-type bots that lets you keep each specific function separate. You can have separate
       modules for factoid tracking, 'seen' status, karma, googling, etc. Included default modules are below.
       Use "perldoc Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::&lt;module name"&gt; for help on their individual terminology.

         Auth    - user authentication and admin access.
         DNS     - host lookup (e.g. nslookup and dns).
         Google  - search Google for things.
         Infobot - handles infobot-style factoids.
         Join    - joins and leaves channels.
         Karma   - tracks the popularity of things.
         Loader  - loads and unloads modules as bot commands.
         Seen    - tells you when people were last seen.
         Title   - gets the title of URLs mentioned in channel.
         Vars    - changes module variables.

       The way the Pluggable bot works is very simple. You create a new bot object and tell it to load various
       modules (or, alternatively, load just the Loader module and then interactively load modules via an IRC
       /query). The modules receive events when the bot sees things happen and can, in turn, respond. See
       "perldoc Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module" for the details of the module API.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new(key =&gt; value, ...)
           Create  a  new Bot. Except of the additional attributes loglevel and logconfig identical to the "new"
           method in Bot::BasicBot. Please refer to their accessor for documentation.

       load($module)
           Load a module for the bot by name from "./ModuleName.pm" or "./modules/ModuleName.pm" in  that  order
           if one of these files exist, and falling back to "Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::$module" if not.

       reload($module)
           Reload  the  module  $module  - equivalent to unloading it (if it's already loaded) and reloading it.
           Will stomp the old module's namespace - warnings are expected here. Not totally  clean  -  if  you're
           experiencing odd bugs, restart the bot if possible. Works for minor bug fixes, etc.

       unload($module)
           Removes a module from the bot. It won't get events any more.

       module($module)
           Returns  the  handler  object for the loaded module $module. Used, e.g., to get the 'Auth' handler to
           check if a given user is authenticated.

       modules
           Returns a list of the names of all loaded modules as an array.

       available_modules
           Returns a list of all available modules whether loaded or not

       add_handler($handler_object, $handler_name)
           Adds a handler object with the given name to the queue  of  modules.  There  is  no  order  specified
           internally,  so  adding  a  module  earlier  does not guarantee it'll get called first. Names must be
           unique.

       remove_handler($handler_name)
           Remove a handler with the given name.

       store
           Returns the bot's object store; see Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Store.

       log Logs all of its argument to loglevel info. Please do not use this function in new code,  it's  simple
           provided as fallback for old modules.

       loglevel
           Returns  the  bots  loglevel  or  sets it if an argument is supplied.  It expects trace, debug, info,
           warn, error or fatal as value.

       logconfig
           Returns the bot configuration file  for  logging.  Please  refer  to  Log::Log4perl::Config  for  the
           configurations files format. Setting this to a different file after calling <b>init()</b> has no effect.

           Returns or set

       dispatch($method_name, $method_params)
           Call the named $method on every loaded module with that method name.

       help
           Returns help for the ModuleName of message 'help ModuleName'. If no message has been passed, return a
           list of all possible handlers to return help for.

       run Runs the bot. POE core gets control at this point; you're unlikely to get it back.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       During  the  "make",  "make  test", "make install" process, POE will moan about its kernel not being run.
       This is a "Bot::BasicBot problem", apparently.  Reloading a module causes warnings as the old module gets
       its namespace stomped.  Not a lot you can do about that. All modules must be in  Bot::Pluggable::Module::
       namespace. Well, that's not really a bug.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable  is based on POE, and really needs the latest version.  Because POE is like that
       sometimes. You also need POE::Component::IRC.  Oh, and Bot::BasicBot. Some of the modules will need  more
       modules, e.g.  Google.pm needs Net::Google. See the module docs for more details.

</pre><h4><b>CREDITS</b></h4><pre>
       Bot::BasicBot was written initially by Mark Fowler, and worked on heavily by Simon  Kent,  who  was  kind
       enough  to  apply some patches we needed for Pluggable.  Eventually. Oh, yeah, and I stole huge chunks of
       docs from the Bot::BasicBot source too. I spent a lot of time in the mozbot code, and that has influenced
       my ideas for Pluggable. Mostly to get round its awfulness.

       Various people helped with modules. Convert was almost ported from the infobot code  by  blech.  But  not
       quite.  Thanks  for  trying... blech has also put a lot of effort into the chump.cgi &amp; chump.tem files in
       the examples/ folder, including some /inspired/ calendar evilness.

       And thanks to the rest of #2lmc who were my unwilling  guinea  pigs  during  development.  And  who  kept
       suggesting totally stupid ideas for modules that I then felt compelled to go implement. Shout.pm owes its
       existence to #2lmc.

       Thanks  to  Mike  Eldridge  (DIZ),  maintainer  until 2016, for kindly transferring maintainership to me,
       BIGPRESH, so I can keep this useful bot framework alive.
