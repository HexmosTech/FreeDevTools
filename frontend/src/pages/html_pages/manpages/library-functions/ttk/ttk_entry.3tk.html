       ttk::entry - Editable text field widget

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ttk::entry</b> <u>pathName</u> ?<u>options</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An  <b>ttk::entry</b>  widget  displays  a one-line text string and allows that string to be edited by the user.
       The value of the string may be linked to a Tcl variable with the  <b>-textvariable</b>  option.   Entry  widgets
       support horizontal scrolling with the standard <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option and <b>xview</b> widget command.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-class</b>                <b>-cursor</b>
       <b>-font</b>                 <b>-foreground</b>
       <b>-style</b>
       <b>-takefocus</b>            <b>-xscrollcommand</b>      <b>-placeholder-placeholderforeground</b>

       See the <b>ttk_widget</b> manual entry for details on the standard options.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-exportselection</b>
       Database Name:  <b>exportSelection</b>
       Database Class: <b>ExportSelection</b>

              A  boolean  value  specifying  whether  or not a selection in the widget should be linked to the X
              selection.  If the selection is exported, then selecting in the widget  deselects  the  current  X
              selection,  selecting  outside  the  widget  deselects  any  widget selection, and the widget will
              respond to selection retrieval requests when it has a selection.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-invalidcommand</b>
       Database Name:  <b>invalidCommand</b>
       Database Class: <b>InvalidCommand</b>

              A script template to evaluate whenever the <b>-validatecommand</b> returns 0.  See <b>VALIDATION</b>  below  for
              more information.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-justify</b>
       Database Name:  <b>justify</b>
       Database Class: <b>Justify</b>

              Specifies how the text is aligned within the entry widget.  One of <b>left</b>, <b>center</b>, or <b>right</b>.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-show</b>
       Database Name:  <b>show</b>
       Database Class: <b>Show</b>

              If  this option is specified, then the true contents of the entry are not displayed in the window.
              Instead, each character in the entry's value will be displayed as the first character in the value
              of this option, such as “*” or a bullet.  This is useful, for example, if the entry is to be  used
              to  enter  a  password.   If  characters  in  the  entry  are  selected  and copied elsewhere, the
              information copied will be what is displayed, not the true contents of the entry.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-state</b>
       Database Name:  <b>state</b>
       Database Class: <b>State</b>

              Compatibility option; see <u>ttk::<a href="../man3tk/widget.3tk.html">widget</a>(3tk)</u> for details.  Specifies one of  three  states  for  the
              entry, <b>normal</b>, <b>disabled</b>, or <b>readonly</b>.  See <b>WIDGET</b> <b>STATES</b>, below.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-textvariable</b>
       Database Name:  <b>textVariable</b>
       Database Class: <b>Variable</b>

              Specifies  the  name  of  a  global variable whose value is linked to the entry widget's contents.
              Whenever the variable changes value, the widget's contents are updated, and vice versa.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-validate</b>
       Database Name:  <b>validate</b>
       Database Class: <b>Validate</b>

              Specifies the mode in which validation should operate: <b>none</b>, <b>focus</b>,  <b>focusin</b>,  <b>focusout</b>,  <b>key</b>,  or
              <b>all</b>.  Default is <b>none</b>, meaning that validation is disabled.  See <b>VALIDATION</b> below.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-validatecommand</b>
       Database Name:  <b>validateCommand</b>
       Database Class: <b>ValidateCommand</b>

              A  script  template to evaluate whenever validation is triggered.  If set to the empty string (the
              default), validation is disabled.  The script must return a boolean value.  See <b>VALIDATION</b> below.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-width</b>
       Database Name:  <b>width</b>
       Database Class: <b>Width</b>

              Specifies an integer value indicating the desired width  of  the  entry  window,  in  average-size
              characters of the widget's font.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       A  portion  of the entry may be selected as described below.  If an entry is exporting its selection (see
       the <b>-exportselection</b> option), then it will observe the standard X11 protocols for handling the selection;
       entry selections are available as type <b>STRING</b>.  Entries also observe the standard Tk  rules  for  dealing
       with  the  input focus.  When an entry has the input focus it displays an <u>insert</u> <u>cursor</u> to indicate where
       new characters will be inserted.

       Entries are capable of displaying strings that are too long to fit entirely within the  widget's  window.
       In  this  case,  only a portion of the string will be displayed;  commands described below may be used to
       change the view in the window.  Entries use the standard <b>-xscrollcommand</b> mechanism for  interacting  with
       scrollbars (see the description of the <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option for details).

</pre><h4><b>INDICES</b></h4><pre>
       Many of the <b>entry</b> widget commands take one or more indices as arguments.  An index specifies a particular
       character in the entry's string, in any of the following ways:

       <u>number</u> Specifies  the  character  as a numerical index, where 0 corresponds to the first character in the
              string.

       <b>@</b><u>number</u>
              In this form, <u>number</u> is treated as an x-coordinate in the entry's window;  the character  spanning
              that x-coordinate is used.  For example, “<b>@0</b>” indicates the left-most character in the window.

       <b>end</b>    Indicates  the  character  just  after  the last one in the entry's string.  This is equivalent to
              specifying a numerical index equal to the length of the entry's string.

       <b>insert</b> Indicates the character adjacent to and immediately following the insert cursor.

       <b>sel.first</b>
              Indicates the first character in the selection.  It is an error to use this form if the  selection
              is not in the entry window.

       <b>sel.last</b>
              Indicates the character just after the last one in the selection.  It is an error to use this form
              if the selection is not in the entry window.

       Abbreviations  may  be  used  for  any of the forms above, e.g. “<b>e</b>” or “<b>sel.l</b>”.  In general, out-of-range
       indices are automatically  rounded  to  the  nearest  legal  value.   Indexes  support  the  same  simple
       interpretation  as  for  the  command  <b>string</b>  <b>index</b>,  with  simple integer index arithmetic and indexing
       relative to <b>end</b>.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the standard <b>cget</b>, <b>configure</b>, <b>identify</b> <b>element</b>, <b>instate</b>, <b>state</b>, <b>style</b> and  <b>xview</b>  commands
       (see <b>ttk::widget</b>), entry widgets support the following additional commands:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bbox</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns  a  list of four numbers describing the bounding box of the character given by <u>index</u>.  The
              first two elements of the list give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the screen
              area covered by the character (in pixels relative to the widget) and the last  two  elements  give
              the  width and height of the character, in pixels.  The bounding box may refer to a region outside
              the visible area of the window.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
              Delete one or more elements of the entry.  <u>First</u> is the index of the first  character  to  delete,
              and  <u>last</u>  is  the  index  of  the  character  just  after the last one to delete.  If <u>last</u> is not
              specified it defaults to <u>first</u>+1, i.e. a single character is deleted.  This  command  returns  the
              empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>get</b>
              Returns the entry's string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>icursor</b> <u>index</u>
              Arrange  for  the insert cursor to be displayed just before the character given by <u>index</u>.  Returns
              the empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>index</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns the numerical index corresponding to <u>index</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <u>index</u> <u>string</u>
              Insert <u>string</u> just before the character indicated by <u>index</u>.  Returns the empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u>
              This command is used to adjust the selection within an entry.  It has several forms, depending  on
              <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>clear</b>
                     Clear  the  selection  if  it is currently in this widget.  If the selection is not in this
                     widget then the command has no effect.  Returns the empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>present</b>
                     Returns 1 if there is are characters selected in the entry, 0 if nothing is selected.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>range</b> <u>start</u> <u>end</u>
                     Sets the selection to include the characters starting with the one  indexed  by  <u>start</u>  and
                     ending  with  the  one just before <u>end</u>.  If <u>end</u> refers to the same character as <u>start</u> or an
                     earlier one, then the entry's selection is cleared.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>validate</b>
              Force revalidation, independent of the conditions specified by the <b>-validate</b> option.  Returns 0 if
              validation fails, 1 if it succeeds.  Sets or clears the <b>invalid</b> state accordingly.  See <b>VALIDATION</b>
              below for more details.

</pre><h4><b>VALIDATION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-validate</b>, <b>-validatecommand</b>, and <b>-invalidcommand</b> options are used to enable entry widget validation.

   <b>VALIDATION</b> <b>MODES</b>
       There are two main validation modes: <u>prevalidation</u>, in which the <b>-validatecommand</b> is evaluated  prior  to
       each  edit  and  the  return  value  is  used  to  determine  whether to accept or reject the change; and
       <u>revalidation</u>, in which the <b>-validatecommand</b> is evaluated to determine whether the current value is valid.

       The <b>-validate</b> option determines when validation occurs; it may be set to any of the following values:

              <b>none</b>   Default.  This means validation will only occur when specifically requested by the <b>validate</b>
                     widget command.

              <b>key</b>    The entry will be prevalidated prior to each edit (specifically,  whenever  the  <b>insert</b>  or
                     <b>delete</b> widget commands are called).  If prevalidation fails, the edit is rejected.

              <b>focus</b>  The entry is revalidated when the entry receives or loses focus.

              <b>focusin</b>
                     The entry is revalidated when the entry receives focus.

              <b>focusout</b>
                     The entry is revalidated when the entry loses focus.

              <b>all</b>    Validation is performed for all above conditions.

       The <b>-invalidcommand</b> is evaluated whenever the <b>-validatecommand</b> returns a false value.

       The  <b>-validatecommand</b>  and  <b>-invalidcommand</b>  may modify the entry widget's value via the widget <b>insert</b> or
       <b>delete</b> commands, or by setting the linked <b>-textvariable</b>.  If either does so  during  prevalidation,  then
       the edit is rejected regardless of the value returned by the <b>-validatecommand</b>.

       If <b>-validatecommand</b> is empty (the default), validation always succeeds.

   <b>VALIDATION</b> <b>SCRIPT</b> <b>SUBSTITUTIONS</b>
       It is possible to perform percent substitutions on the <b>-validatecommand</b> and <b>-invalidcommand</b>, just as in a
       <b>bind</b> script.  The following substitutions are recognized:

              <b>%d</b>     Type  of  action:  1  for  <b>insert</b>  prevalidation,  0  for  <b>delete</b>  prevalidation, or -1 for
                     revalidation.

              <b>%i</b>     Index of character string to be inserted/deleted, if any, otherwise -1.

              <b>%P</b>     In prevalidation, the new value of the entry if the edit is accepted.  In revalidation, the
                     current value of the entry.

              <b>%s</b>     The current value of entry prior to editing.

              <b>%S</b>     The text string being inserted/deleted, if any, {} otherwise.

              <b>%v</b>     The current value of the <b>-validate</b> option.

              <b>%V</b>     The validation condition that triggered the callback (<b>key</b>, <b>focusin</b>, <b>focusout</b>, or <b>forced</b>).

              <b>%W</b>     The name of the entry widget.

   <b>DIFFERENCES</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>TK</b> <b>ENTRY</b> <b>WIDGET</b> <b>VALIDATION</b>
       The standard Tk entry widget automatically disables validation (by setting  <b>-validate</b>  to  <b>none</b>)  if  the
       <b>-validatecommand</b> or <b>-invalidcommand</b> modifies the entry's value.  The Tk themed entry widget only disables
       validation  if  one  of  the validation scripts raises an error, or if <b>-validatecommand</b> does not return a
       valid boolean value.  (Thus, it is not necessary to re-enable validation after modifying the entry  value
       in a validation script).

       In  addition, the standard entry widget invokes validation whenever the linked <b>-textvariable</b> is modified;
       the Tk themed entry widget does not.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The entry widget's default bindings enable the following behavior.  In  the  descriptions  below,  “word”
       refers  to  a  contiguous group of letters, digits, or “_” characters, or any single character other than
       these.

        •  Clicking mouse button 1 positions the insert cursor just before the character  underneath  the  mouse
           cursor,  sets  the input focus to this widget, and clears any selection in the widget.  Dragging with
           mouse button 1 down strokes out a selection between the insert cursor and  the  character  under  the
           mouse.

        •  Double-clicking  with mouse button 1 selects the word under the mouse and positions the insert cursor
           at the end of the word.  Dragging after a double click strokes out a selection  consisting  of  whole
           words.

        •  Triple-clicking  with  mouse  button  1 selects all of the text in the entry and positions the insert
           cursor at the end of the line.

        •  The ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging with mouse button 1  while  the  Shift  key  is
           down.   If  the button is double-clicked before dragging then the selection will be adjusted in units
           of whole words.

        •  Clicking mouse button 1 with the Control key down will  position  the  insert  cursor  in  the  entry
           without affecting the selection.

        •  If any normal printing characters are typed in an entry, they are inserted at the point of the insert
           cursor.

        •  The view in the entry can be adjusted by dragging with the middle mouse button (button 2, or button 3
           in  TkAqua).  If the middle mouse button is clicked without moving the mouse, the selection is copied
           into the entry at the position of the mouse cursor.

        •  If the mouse is dragged out of the entry on the left or right sides while button 1  is  pressed,  the
           entry  will  automatically  scroll to make more text visible (if there is more text off-screen on the
           side where the mouse left the window).

        •  The Left and Right keys move the insert cursor one character to the left or right;  they  also  clear
           any  selection  in  the entry.  If Left or Right is typed with the Shift key down, then the insertion
           cursor moves and the selection is extended to include the new character.  Control-Left  and  Control-
           Right move the insert cursor by words, and Control-Shift-Left and Control-Shift-Right move the insert
           cursor  by  words and also extend the selection.  Control-b and Control-f behave the same as Left and
           Right, respectively.

        •  The Home key and Control-a move the insert cursor to  the  beginning  of  the  entry  and  clear  any
           selection in the entry.  Shift-Home moves the insert cursor to the beginning of the entry and extends
           the selection to that point.

        •  The  End  key and Control-e move the insert cursor to the end of the entry and clear any selection in
           the entry.  Shift-End moves the cursor to the end and extends the selection to that point.

        •  Control-/ selects all the text in the entry.

        •  Control-\ clears any selection in the entry.

        •  The standard Tk &lt;&lt;Cut&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;Copy&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;, and &lt;&lt;Clear&gt;&gt; virtual events operate on  the  selection
           in the expected manner.

        •  The  Delete  key  deletes  the selection, if there is one in the entry.  If there is no selection, it
           deletes the character to the right of the insert cursor.

        •  The BackSpace key and Control-h delete the selection, if there is one in the entry.  If there  is  no
           selection, it deletes the character to the left of the insert cursor.

        •  Control-d deletes the character to the right of the insert cursor.

        •  Control-k deletes all the characters to the right of the insertion cursor.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>STATES</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  <b>disabled</b>  state,  the  entry  cannot be edited and the text cannot be selected.  In the <b>readonly</b>
       state, no insert cursor is displayed and the entry cannot be edited (specifically: the <b>insert</b> and  <b>delete</b>
       commands  have  no  effect).   The <b>disabled</b> state is the same as <b>readonly</b>, and in addition text cannot be
       selected.

       Note that changes to the linked <b>-textvariable</b> will still be  reflected  in  the  entry,  even  if  it  is
       disabled or readonly.

       Typically,  the  text  is  “grayed-out”  in the <b>disabled</b> state, and a different background is used in the
       <b>readonly</b> state.

       The entry widget sets the <b>invalid</b>  state  if  revalidation  fails,  and  clears  it  whenever  validation
       succeeds.

</pre><h4><b>STYLING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The class name for a <b>ttk::entry</b> is <b>TEntry</b>.

       Dynamic states: <b>disabled</b>, <b>focus</b>, <b>readonly</b>.

       <b>TEntry</b> styling options configurable with <b>ttk::style</b> are:

       <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>
              For  backwards  compatibility,  when  using  the aqua theme (for macOS), this option behaves as an
              alias for the <b>-fieldbackground</b> provided that no value is specified for <b>-fieldbackground</b>. Otherwise
              it is ignored.
       <b>-bordercolor</b> <u>color</u>
       <b>-darkcolor</b> <u>color</u>
       <b>-fieldbackground</b> <u>color</u>
              Some themes use a graphical background and their field background colors cannot be changed.
       <b>-foreground</b> <u>color</u>
       <b>-insertcolor</b> <u>color</u>
       <b>-insertwidth</b> <u>amount</u>
       <b>-lightcolor</b> <u>color</u>
       <b>-padding</b> <u>padding</u>
       <b>-placeholderforeground</b> <u>color</u>
       <b>-relief</b> <u>relief</u>
       <b>-selectbackground</b> <u>color</u>
