</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pthread_rwlock_trywrlock, pthread_rwlock_wrlock — lock a read-write lock object for writing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</a>&gt;

       int pthread_rwlock_trywrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *<u>rwlock</u>);
       int pthread_rwlock_wrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *<u>rwlock</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>pthread_rwlock_trywrlock</u>()  function  shall  apply  a  write  lock  like the <u>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</u>()
       function, with the exception that the function shall fail if  any  thread  currently  holds  <u>rwlock</u>  (for
       reading or writing).

       The  <u>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</u>()  function  shall  apply  a  write  lock to the read-write lock referenced by
       <u>rwlock</u>.  The calling thread shall acquire the write lock if no thread (reader or writer) holds the  read-
       write  lock  <u>rwlock</u>.   Otherwise,  if another thread holds the read-write lock <u>rwlock</u>, the calling thread
       shall block until it can acquire the lock.  If a deadlock condition occurs or the calling thread  already
       owns the read-write lock for writing or reading, the call shall either deadlock or return <b>[EDEADLK]</b>.

       Results are undefined if any of these functions are called with an uninitialized read-write lock.

       If  a  signal  is  delivered  to a thread waiting for a read-write lock for writing, upon return from the
       signal handler the thread resumes waiting  for  the  read-write  lock  for  writing  as  if  it  was  not
       interrupted.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>pthread_rwlock_trywrlock</u>() function shall return zero if the lock for writing on the read-write lock
       object referenced by <u>rwlock</u> is acquired. Otherwise, an error number shall be  returned  to  indicate  the
       error.

       If  successful,  the <u>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</u>() function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall
       be returned to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pthread_rwlock_trywrlock</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBUSY</b>  The read-write lock could not be acquired for writing because it was already locked for reading or
              writing.

       The <u>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EDEADLK</b>
              A deadlock condition was detected or the current thread  already  owns  the  read-write  lock  for
              writing or reading.

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Applications  using  these  functions  may  be  subject  to  priority inversion, as discussed in the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>3.291</u>, <u>Priority</u> <u>Inversion</u>.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       If   an   implementation   detects   that   the   value   specified   by   the   <u>rwlock</u>    argument    to
       <u>pthread_rwlock_trywrlock</u>()  or  <u>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</u>()  does not refer to an initialized read-write lock
       object, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL]</b> error.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
