</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Violation - A violation of a Policy found in some source code.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use PPI;
         use Perl::Critic::Violation;

         my $elem = $doc-&gt;<a href="../man0/child.0.html">child</a>(0);      # $doc is a PPI::Document object
         my $desc = 'Offending code';    # Describe the violation
         my $expl = [1,45,67];           # Page numbers from PBP
         my $sev  = 5;                   # Severity level of this violation

         my $vio  = Perl::Critic::Violation-&gt;new($desc, $expl, $node, $sev);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Violation is the generic representation of an individual Policy violation.  Its primary
       purpose is to provide an abstraction layer so that clients of Perl::Critic don't have to know anything
       about PPI.  The "violations" method of all Perl::Critic::Policy subclasses must return a list of these
       Perl::Critic::Violation objects.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       This is considered to be a public class.  Any changes to its interface will go through a deprecation
       cycle.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       "new( $description, $explanation, $element, $severity )"
           Returns a reference to a new "Perl::Critic::Violation" object. The arguments are a description of the
           violation  (as  string), an explanation for the policy (as string) or a series of page numbers in PBP
           (as an ARRAY ref), a reference to the PPI element that caused the violation, and the severity of  the
           violation (as an integer).

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       description()
           Returns  a  brief  description of the specific violation.  In other words, this value may change on a
           per violation basis.

       explanation()
           Returns an explanation of the policy as a string or as reference to an array of page numbers in  PBP.
           This value will generally not change based upon the specific code violating the policy.

       location()
           Don't   use   this   method.    Use   the   line_number(),   logical_line_number(),  column_number(),
           visual_column_number(), and logical_filename() methods instead.

           Returns a five-element array reference containing the line and real  &amp;  virtual  column  and  logical
           numbers and logical file name where this Violation occurred, as in PPI::Element.

       line_number()
           Returns the physical line number that the violation was found on.

       logical_line_number()
           Returns  the  logical line number that the violation was found on.  This can differ from the physical
           line number when there were "#line" directives in the code.

       column_number()
           Returns the physical column that the violation was found at.  This means  that  hard  tab  characters
           count as a single character.

       visual_column_number()
           Returns  the  column  that the violation was found at, as it would appear if hard tab characters were
           expanded, based upon the value of "tab_width [ $width ]" in PPI::Document.

       filename()
           Returns the path to the file where this Violation occurred.  In some cases, the path may be undefined
           because the source code was not read directly from a file.

       logical_filename()
           Returns the logical path to the file where the Violation occurred.  This can differ  from  filename()
           when there was a "#line" directive in the code.

       severity()
           Returns  the  severity  of  this  Violation  as an integer ranging from 1 to 5, where 5 is the "most"
           severe.

       sort_by_severity( @violation_objects )
           If you need to sort Violations by severity, use this handy routine:

               @sorted = Perl::Critic::Violation::sort_by_severity(@violations);

       sort_by_location( @violation_objects )
           If you need to sort Violations by location, use this handy routine:

               @sorted = Perl::Critic::Violation::sort_by_location(@violations);

       diagnostics()
           Returns a formatted string containing a full discussion of the motivation  for  and  details  of  the
           Policy  module  that  created  this  Violation.  This information is automatically extracted from the
           "DESCRIPTION" section of the Policy module's POD.

       policy()
           Returns the name of the Perl::Critic::Policy that created this Violation.

       source()
           Returns the string of source code that caused this exception.  If the code spans multiple lines (e.g.
           multi-line statements, subroutines or other blocks), then only the line containing the violation will
           be returned.

       element_class()
           Returns the PPI::Element subclass of the code that caused this exception.

       set_format( $format )
           Class method.  Sets the format for all Violation objects when they are evaluated in  string  context.
           The default is '%d at line %l, column %c. %e'.  See "OVERLOADS" for formatting options.

       get_format()
           Class  method. Returns the current format for all Violation objects when they are evaluated in string
           context.

       to_string()
           Returns a string representation of this violation.  The content of the string depends on the  current
           value of the $format package variable.  See "OVERLOADS" for the details.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLOADS</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Violation  overloads  the  ""  operator  to  produce neat little messages when evaluated in
       string context.

       Formats are a combination of literal and escape characters similar to the way "sprintf"  works.   If  you
       want to know the specific formatting capabilities, look at String::Format. Valid escape characters are:

           Escape    Meaning
           -------   ----------------------------------------------------------------
           %c        Column number where the violation occurred
           %d        Full diagnostic discussion of the violation (DESCRIPTION in POD)
           %e        Explanation of violation or page numbers in PBP
           %F        Just the name of the logical file where the violation occurred.
           %f        Path to the logical file where the violation occurred.
           %G        Just the name of the physical file where the violation occurred.
           %g        Path to the physical file where the violation occurred.
           %l        Logical line number where the violation occurred
           %L        Physical line number where the violation occurred
           %m        Brief description of the violation
           %P        Full name of the Policy module that created the violation
           %p        Name of the Policy without the Perl::Critic::Policy:: prefix
           %r        The string of source code that caused the violation
           %C        The class of the PPI::Element that caused the violation
           %s        The severity level of the violation

       Explanation of the %F, %f, %G, %G, %l, and %L formats: Using "#line" directives, you can affect what perl
       thinks  the  current  line  number  and file name are; see "Plain Old Comments (Not!)" in perlsyn for the
       details.  Under normal circumstances, the values of %F, %f, and %l will match the values of %G,  %g,  and
       %L,  respectively.   In  the presence of a "#line" directive, the values of %F, %f, and %l will change to
       take that directive into account.  The values of %G, %g, and %L are unaffected by those directives.

       Here are some examples:

           Perl::Critic::Violation::set_format("%m at line %l, column %c.\n");
           # looks like "Mixed case variable name at line 6, column 23."

           Perl::Critic::Violation::set_format("%m near '%r'\n");
           # looks like "Mixed case variable name near 'my $theGreatAnswer = 42;'"

           Perl::Critic::Violation::set_format("%l:%c:%p\n");
           # looks like "6:23:NamingConventions::Capitalization"

           Perl::Critic::Violation::set_format("%m at line %l. %e. \n%d\n");
           # looks like "Mixed case variable name at line 6.  See page 44 of PBP.
             Conway's recommended naming convention is to use lower-case words
             separated by underscores.  Well-recognized acronyms can be in ALL
             CAPS, but must be separated by underscores from other parts of the
             name."
