</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bigint - transparent big integer support for Perl

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use bigint;

           $x = 2 + 4.5;                       # Math::BigInt 6
           print 2 ** 512;                     # Math::BigInt 134...096
           print inf + 42;                     # Math::BigInt inf
           print NaN * 7;                      # Math::BigInt NaN
           print hex("0x1234567890123490");    # Perl v5.10.0 or later

           {
               no bigint;
               print 2 ** 256;                 # a normal Perl scalar now
           }

           # for older Perls, import into current package:
           use bigint qw/hex oct/;
           print hex("0x1234567890123490");
           print oct("01234567890123490");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       All numeric literal in the given scope are converted to Math::BigInt objects.  Numeric literal that
       represent non-integers are truncated to an integer. All results of expressions are also truncated to
       integer.

       All operators (including basic math operations) except the range operator ".."  are overloaded.

       Unlike the integer pragma, the "bigint" pragma creates integers that are only limited in their size by
       the available memory.

       So, the following:

           use bigint;
           $x = 1234;

       creates a Math::BigInt and stores a reference to in $x. This happens transparently and behind your back,
       so to speak.

       You can see this with the following:

           perl -Mbigint -le 'print <a href="../man1234/ref.1234.html">ref</a>(1234)'

       Since numbers are actually objects, you can call all the usual methods from Math::BigFloat on them. This
       even works to some extent on expressions:

           perl -Mbigint -le '$x = 1234; print $x-&gt;bdec()'
           perl -Mbigint -le 'print 1234-&gt;copy()-&gt;binc();'
           perl -Mbigint -le 'print 1234-&gt;copy()-&gt;binc-&gt;<a href="../man6/badd.6.html">badd</a>(6);'
           perl -Mbigint -le 'print +(1234)-&gt;copy()-&gt;binc()'

       (Note that print doesn't do what you expect if the expression starts with '(' hence the "+")

       You can even chain the operations together as usual:

           perl -Mbigint -le 'print 1234-&gt;copy()-&gt;binc-&gt;<a href="../man6/badd.6.html">badd</a>(6);'
           1241

       Please note the following does not work as expected (prints nothing), since overloading of '..' is not
       yet possible in Perl (as of v5.8.0):

           perl -Mbigint -le 'for (1..2) { print ref($_); }'

   <b>use</b> <b>integer</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>use</b> <b>bigint</b>
       There are some difference between "use integer" and "use bigint".

       Whereas "use integer" is limited to what can be handled as a Perl scalar, "use bigint" can handle
       arbitrarily large integers.

       Also, "use integer" does affect assignments to variables and the return value of some functions. "use
       bigint" truncates these results to integer:

           # perl -Minteger -wle 'print 3.2'
           3.2
           # perl -Minteger -wle 'print 3.2 + 0'
           3
           # perl -Mbigint -wle 'print 3.2'
           3
           # perl -Mbigint -wle 'print 3.2 + 0'
           3

           # perl -Mbigint -wle 'print <a href="../man1/exp.1.html">exp</a>(1) + 0'
           2
           # perl -Mbigint -wle 'print <a href="../man1/exp.1.html">exp</a>(1)'
           2
           # perl -Minteger -wle 'print <a href="../man1/exp.1.html">exp</a>(1)'
           2.71828182845905
           # perl -Minteger -wle 'print <a href="../man1/exp.1.html">exp</a>(1) + 0'
           2

       In practice this seldom makes a difference for small integers as <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> <b>results</b> of expressions are
       truncated anyway, but this can, for instance, affect the return value of subroutines:

           sub three_integer { use integer; return 3.2; }
           sub three_bigint { use bigint; return 3.2; }

           print three_integer(), " ", three_bigint(),"\n";    # prints "3.2 3"

   <b>Options</b>
       "bigint" recognizes some options that can be passed while loading it via "use". The following options
       exist:

       a or accuracy
           This  sets  the accuracy for all math operations. The argument must be greater than or equal to zero.
           See Math::BigInt's <b>bround()</b> method for details.

               perl -Mbigint=a,2 -le 'print 12345+1'

           Note that setting precision and accuracy at the same time is not possible.

       p or precision
           This sets the precision for all math operations. The argument can be  any  integer.  Negative  values
           mean  a  fixed number of digits after the dot, and are ignored since all operations happen in integer
           space. A positive value rounds to this digit left from  the  dot.  0  means  round  to  integer.  See
           Math::BigInt's <b>bfround()</b> method for details.

               perl -mbigint=p,5 -le 'print 123456789+123'

           Note that setting precision and accuracy at the same time is not possible.

       t or trace
           This enables a trace mode and is primarily for debugging.

       l, lib, try, or only
           Load a different math lib, see "Math Library".

               perl -Mbigint=l,GMP -e 'print 2 ** 512'
               perl -Mbigint=lib,GMP -e 'print 2 ** 512'
               perl -Mbigint=try,GMP -e 'print 2 ** 512'
               perl -Mbigint=only,GMP -e 'print 2 ** 512'

       hex Override  the built-in <b>hex()</b> method with a version that can handle big numbers.  This overrides it by
           exporting it to the current package. Under Perl v5.10.0 and higher, this is not necessary,  as  <b>hex()</b>
           is lexically overridden in the current scope whenever the "bigint" pragma is active.

       oct Override  the built-in <b>oct()</b> method with a version that can handle big numbers.  This overrides it by
           exporting it to the current package. Under Perl v5.10.0 and higher, this  is  not  so  necessary,  as
           <b>oct()</b> is lexically overridden in the current scope whenever the "bigint" pragma is active.

       v or version
           this prints out the name and version of the modules and then exits.

               perl -Mbigint=v

   <b>Math</b> <b>Library</b>
       Math  with  the  numbers  is done (by default) by a backend library module called Math::BigInt::Calc. The
       default is equivalent to saying:

           use bigint lib =&gt; 'Calc';

       you can change this by using:

           use bigint lib =&gt; 'GMP';

       The following would first try to find Math::BigInt::Foo, then Math::BigInt::Bar, and if this also  fails,
       revert to Math::BigInt::Calc:

           use bigint lib =&gt; 'Foo,Math::BigInt::Bar';

       Using  c&lt;lib&gt;  warns if none of the specified libraries can be found and Math::BigInt fell back to one of
       the default libraries. To suppress this warning, use c&lt;try&gt; instead:

           use bigint try =&gt; 'GMP';

       If you want the code to die instead of falling back, use "only" instead:

           use bigint only =&gt; 'GMP';

       Please see the respective module documentation for further details.

   <b>Method</b> <b>calls</b>
       Since all numbers are now objects, you can use all methods that are part of the Math::BigInt API.

       But a warning is in order. When using the following to make a copy of a number, only a shallow copy  will
       be made.

           $x = 9; $y = $x;
           $x = $y = 7;

       Using the copy or the original with overloaded math is okay, e.g., the following work:

           $x = 9; $y = $x;
           print $x + 1, " ", $y,"\n";     # prints 10 9

       but  calling  any  method that modifies the number directly will result in <b>both</b> the original and the copy
       being destroyed:

           $x = 9; $y = $x;
           print $x-&gt;<a href="../man1/badd.1.html">badd</a>(1), " ", $y,"\n";        # prints 10 10

           $x = 9; $y = $x;
           print $x-&gt;<a href="../man1/binc.1.html">binc</a>(1), " ", $y,"\n";        # prints 10 10

           $x = 9; $y = $x;
           print $x-&gt;<a href="../man2/bmul.2.html">bmul</a>(2), " ", $y,"\n";        # prints 18 18

       Using methods that do not modify, but test that the contents works:

           $x = 9; $y = $x;
           $z = 9 if $x-&gt;is_zero();                # works fine

       See the documentation about the copy constructor and "=" in overload, as well  as  the  documentation  in
       Math::BigInt for further details.

   <b>Methods</b>
       <b>inf()</b>
           A  shortcut to return Math::BigInt-&gt;<b>binf()</b>. Useful because Perl does not always handle bareword "inf"
           properly.

       <b>NaN()</b>
           A shortcut to return Math::BigInt-&gt;<b>bnan()</b>. Useful because Perl does not always handle bareword  "NaN"
           properly.

       e
               # perl -Mbigint=e -wle 'print e'

           Returns  Euler's  number  "e", aka <b><a href="../man1/exp.1.html">exp</a></b>(1). Note that under "bigint", this is truncated to an integer,
           i.e., 2.

       PI
               # perl -Mbigint=PI -wle 'print PI'

           Returns PI. Note that under "bigint", this is truncated to an integer, i.e., 3.

       <b>bexp()</b>
               bexp($power, $accuracy);

           Returns Euler's number "e" raised to the appropriate power, to the wanted accuracy.

           Note that under "bigint", the result is truncated to an integer.

           Example:

               # perl -Mbigint=bexp -wle 'print bexp(1,80)'

       <b>bpi()</b>
               bpi($accuracy);

           Returns PI to the wanted accuracy. Note that under "bigint", this is truncated to an  integer,  i.e.,
           3.

           Example:

               # perl -Mbigint=bpi -wle 'print <a href="../man80/bpi.80.html">bpi</a>(80)'

       <b>accuracy()</b>
           Set or get the accuracy.

       <b>precision()</b>
           Set or get the precision.

       <b>round_mode()</b>
           Set or get the rounding mode.

       <b>div_scale()</b>
           Set or get the division scale.

       <b>in_effect()</b>
               use bigint;

               print "in effect\n" if bigint::in_effect;       # true
               {
                   no bigint;
                   print "in effect\n" if bigint::in_effect;   # false
               }

           Returns true or false if "bigint" is in effect in the current scope.

           This method only works on Perl v5.9.4 or later.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Hexadecimal, octal, and binary floating point literals
           Perl  (and  this module) accepts hexadecimal, octal, and binary floating point literals, but use them
           with care with Perl versions before v5.32.0, because some versions of Perl silently  give  the  wrong
           result.

       Operator vs literal overloading
           "bigint"  works  by  overloading  handling of integer and floating point literals, converting them to
           Math::BigInt objects.

           This means that arithmetic involving only string values or string literals are performed using Perl's
           built-in operators.

           For example:

               use bigint;
               my $x = "900000000000000009";
               my $y = "900000000000000007";
               print $x - $y;

           outputs 0 on default 32-bit builds, since "bigint" never sees the  string  literals.  To  ensure  the
           expression is all treated as "Math::BigInt" objects, use a literal number in the expression:

               print +(0+$x) - $y;

       Ranges
           Perl  does  not  allow  overloading  of  ranges,  so  you can neither safely use ranges with "bigint"
           endpoints, nor is the iterator variable a "Math::BigInt".

               use 5.010;
               for my $i (12..13) {
                 for my $j (20..21) {
                   say $i ** $j;  # produces a floating-point number,
                                  # not an object
                 }
               }

       <b>in_effect()</b>
           This method only works on Perl v5.9.4 or later.

       <b>hex()</b>/<b>oct()</b>
           "bigint" overrides these routines with versions that can also handle big integer values.  Under  Perl
           prior  to  version  v5.9.4, however, this will not happen unless you specifically ask for it with the
           two import tags "hex" and "oct" - and then it will be global and cannot be disabled  inside  a  scope
           with "no bigint":

               use bigint qw/hex oct/;

               print hex("0x1234567890123456");
               {
                   no bigint;
                   print hex("0x1234567890123456");
               }

           The second call to <b>hex()</b> will warn about a non-portable constant.

           Compare this to:

               use bigint;

               # will warn only under Perl older than v5.9.4
               print hex("0x1234567890123456");

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Some  cool  command  line  examples  to impress the Python crowd ;) You might want to compare them to the
       results under -Mbigfloat or -Mbigrat:

           perl -Mbigint -le 'print <a href="../man33/sqrt.33.html">sqrt</a>(33)'
           perl -Mbigint -le 'print 2**255'
           perl -Mbigint -le 'print 4.5+2**255'
           perl -Mbigint -le 'print 123-&gt;is_odd()'
           perl -Mbigint=l,GMP -le 'print 7 ** 7777'
