       HTML::Mason::Lexer - Generates events based on component source lexing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $lexer = HTML::Mason::Lexer-&gt;new;

         $lexer-&gt;lex( comp_source =&gt; $source, name =&gt; $comp_name, compiler =&gt; $compiler );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Lexer works in tandem with the Compiler to turn Mason component source into something else, generally
       Perl code.

       As the lexer finds component elements, like a tag or block, it calls the appropriate event methods in the
       compiler object it was given.

       It has only a few public methods.

       You can replace this lexer with one of your own simply by telling the Compiler to use a different lexer
       class.  Your lexer class simply needs to call the appropriate methods in the Component Class's API as it
       scans the source.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The lexer has very few public methods.

       new This method creates a new Lexer object.  This methods takes no parameters.

       lex ( comp_source =&gt; ..., name =&gt; ..., compiler =&gt; ... )
           This  method  tells  the lexer to start scanning the given component source.  All of these parameters
           are required.  The "name" parameter will be used in any error messages generated during lexing.   The
           "compiler" object must be an object that implements the Mason Component API.

       line_number
           The current line number that the lexer has reached.

       name
           The name of the component currently being lexed.

       throw_syntax_error ($error)
           This  throws  an  "HTML::Mason::Exception::Syntax"  error  with  the  given  error message as well as
           additional information about the component source.

           This method is used by both the Lexer and the Compiler.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCLASSING</b></h4><pre>
       Any subclass of the lexer should declare itself to be a subclass  of  "HTML::Mason::Lexer",  even  if  it
       plans to override all of its public methods.

       If  you  want  your  subclass to work with the existing Compiler classes in Mason, you must implement the
       methods listed above.  If you plan to use a custom  Compiler  class  that  you're  writing,  you  can  do
       whatever you want.

       We  recommend  that  any parameters you add to Lexer be read-only, because the compiler object_id is only
       computed once on creation and would not reflect any changes to Lexer parameters.
