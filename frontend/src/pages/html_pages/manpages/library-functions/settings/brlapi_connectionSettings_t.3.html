</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       brlapi_connectionSettings_t - Settings structure for <u>BrlAPI</u> connection.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;brlapi.h&gt;

   <b>Data</b> <b>Fields</b>
       const char * <b>auth</b>
       const char * <b>host</b>

</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       This structure holds every parameter needed to connect to <u>BrlAPI:</u> which file the authorization key can be
       found in and which computer to connect to.

       <b>Examples:</b>

           brlapi_connectionSettings_t settings;

           settings.auth="/etc/brlapi.key";
           settings.host="foo";

       <u>libbrlapi</u> will read authorization key from file /etc/brlapi.key and connect to the machine called 'foo',
       on the default TCP port.

       settings.host="10.1.0.2";

       lets directly enter an IP address instead of a machine name.

       settings.host=":1";

       lets <u>libbrlapi</u> connect to the local computer, on port BRLAPI_SOCKETPORTNUM+1

           <b>brlapi_openConnection()</b>

</pre><h4><b>Field</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>const</b> <b>char*</b> <b>brlapi_connectionSettings_t::auth</b>
       For security reasons, <u>libbrlapi</u> has to get authorized to connect to the <u>BrlAPI</u> server. This can be done
       via a secret key, for instance. This is the path to the file which holds it; it will hence have to be
       readable by the application.

       Setting NULL defaults it to local installation setup or to the content of the BRLAPI_AUTH environment
       variable, if it exists.

   <b>const</b> <b>char*</b> <b>brlapi_connectionSettings_t::host</b>
       This tells where the <u>BrlAPI</u> server resides: it might be listening on another computer, on any TCP port.
       It should look like 'foo:1', which means TCP port number BRLAPI_SOCKETPORTNUM+1 on computer called 'foo'.

       <b>Note</b>
           Please check that resolving this name works before complaining

       Settings NULL defaults it to localhost, using the local installation's default TCP port, or to the
       content of the BRLAPI_HOST environment variable, if it exists.
