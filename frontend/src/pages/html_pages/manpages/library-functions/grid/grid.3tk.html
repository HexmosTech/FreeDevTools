       grid - Geometry manager that arranges widgets in a grid

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>grid</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>grid</b> command is used to communicate with the grid geometry manager that arranges widgets in rows and
       columns inside of another window, called the geometry container (or container window).  The <b>grid</b>  command
       can have any of several forms, depending on the <u>option</u> argument:

       <b>grid</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>window</u> <u>...</u>? ?<u>options</u>?
              If the first argument to <b>grid</b> is suitable as the first window argument to <b>grid</b> <b>configure</b>, either a
              window  name  (any  value  starting  with  <b>.</b>)  or  one  of the characters <b>x</b> or <b>^</b> (see the <b>RELATIVE</b>
              <b>PLACEMENT</b> section below), then the command is processed in the same way as <b>grid</b> <b>configure</b>.

       <b>grid</b> <b>anchor</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>anchor</u>?
              The anchor value controls how to place the grid within the container window when no row/column has
              any weight.  See <b>THE</b> <b>GRID</b> <b>ALGORITHM</b> below for further details.  The default <u>anchor</u> is <u>nw</u>.

       <b>grid</b> <b>bbox</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>column</u> <u>row</u>? ?<u>column2</u> <u>row2</u>?
              With no arguments, the bounding box (in pixels)  of  the  grid  is  returned.   The  return  value
              consists  of  4 integers.  The first two are the pixel offset from the container window (x then y)
              of the top-left corner of the grid, and the second two integers are the width and  height  of  the
              grid,  also  in  pixels.   If  a  single <u>column</u> and <u>row</u> is specified on the command line, then the
              bounding box for that cell is returned, where the top left cell is numbered from  zero.   If  both
              <u>column</u>  and  <u>row</u>  arguments  are  specified,  then  the bounding box spanning the rows and columns
              indicated is returned.

       <b>grid</b> <b>columnconfigure</b> <u>window</u> <u>index</u> ?<u>-option</u> <u>value...</u>?
              Query or set the column properties of the <u>index</u> column of the  geometry  container,  <u>window</u>.   The
              valid options are <b>-minsize</b>, <b>-weight</b>, <b>-uniform</b> and <b>-pad</b>.  If one or more options are provided, then
              <u>index</u> may be given as a list of column indices to which the configuration options will operate on.
              Indices may be integers, window names or the keyword <u>all</u>. For <u>all</u> the options apply to all columns
              currently  occupied  be  content windows. For a window name, that window must be a content of this
              container and the options apply to all columns currently occupied be the  content.   The  <b>-minsize</b>
              option  sets  the  minimum  size,  in  screen  units, that will be permitted for this column.  The
              <b>-weight</b> option (an integer value) sets the relative weight for apportioning any extra spaces among
              columns.  A weight of zero (0) indicates the column will not deviate from its requested  size.   A
              column  whose weight is two will grow at twice the rate as a column of weight one when extra space
              is allocated to the layout.  The <b>-uniform</b> option, when a non-empty value is supplied,  places  the
              column in a <u>uniform</u> <u>group</u> with other columns that have the same value for <b>-uniform</b>.  The space for
              columns  belonging  to  a  uniform  group  is  allocated  so that their sizes are always in strict
              proportion to their <b>-weight</b> values.  See <b>THE</b> <b>GRID</b> <b>ALGORITHM</b> below for further details.   The  <b>-pad</b>
              option  specifies  the  number  of screen units that will be added to the largest window contained
              completely in that column when the grid geometry manager  requests  a  size  from  the  containing
              window.   If  only  an  option  is  specified,  with no value, the current value of that option is
              returned.  If only the container window and index is  specified,  all  the  current  settings  are
              returned in a list of “<u>-option</u> <u>value</u>” pairs.

       <b>grid</b> <b>configure</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>window</u> <u>...</u>? ?<u>options</u>?
              The  arguments  consist of the names of one or more content windows followed by pairs of arguments
              that specify how to manage the content.  The characters <b>-</b>,  <b>x</b> and <b>^</b>, can be specified instead of a
              window name to alter the default location of a <u>window</u>, as  described  in  the  <b>RELATIVE</b>  <b>PLACEMENT</b>
              section, below.  The following options are supported:

              <b>-column</b> <u>n</u>
                     Insert  the  window  so  that it occupies the <u>n</u>th column in the grid.  Column numbers start
                     with 0.  If this option is not supplied, then the window is arranged just to the  right  of
                     previous  window  specified  on this call to <b>grid</b>, or column “0” if it is the first window.
                     For each <b>x</b> that immediately precedes the <u>window</u>, the column position is incremented by one.
                     Thus the <b>x</b> represents a blank column for this row in the grid.

              <b>-columnspan</b> <u>n</u>
                     Insert the window so that it occupies <u>n</u> columns in the grid.  The default  is  one  column,
                     unless the window name is followed by a <b>-</b>, in which case the columnspan is incremented once
                     for each immediately following <b>-</b>.

              <b>-in</b> <u>container</u>
                     Insert  the window(s) in the container window given by <u>container</u>.  The default is the first
                     window's parent window.

              <b>-ipadx</b> <u>amount</u>
                     The <u>amount</u> specifies how much horizontal internal padding to leave  on  each  side  of  the
                     content.   This  is  space  is added inside the content border.  The <u>amount</u> must be a valid
                     screen distance, such as <b>2</b> or <b>.5c</b>.  It defaults to 0.

              <b>-ipady</b> <u>amount</u>
                     The <u>amount</u> specifies how much vertical internal padding to leave on the top and  bottom  of
                     the content.  This space is added inside the content border.  The <u>amount</u>  defaults to 0.

              <b>-padx</b> <u>amount</u>
                     The  <u>amount</u>  specifies  how  much  horizontal external padding to leave on each side of the
                     content, in screen units.  <u>Amount</u> may be a list of two values to specify padding  for  left
                     and  right  separately.  The <u>amount</u> defaults to 0.  This space is added outside the content
                     border.

              <b>-pady</b> <u>amount</u>
                     The <u>amount</u> specifies how much vertical external padding to leave on the top and  bottom  of
                     the  content,  in  screen units.  <u>Amount</u> may be a list of two values to specify padding for
                     top and bottom separately.  The <u>amount</u> defaults to 0.  This  space  is  added  outside  the
                     content border.

              <b>-row</b> <u>n</u> Insert  the content so that it occupies the <u>n</u>th row in the grid.  Row numbers start with 0.
                     If this option is not supplied, then the content  is  arranged  on  the  same  row  as  the
                     previous content specified on this call to <b>grid</b>, or the next row after the highest occupied
                     row if this is the first content.

              <b>-rowspan</b> <u>n</u>
                     Insert the content so that it occupies <u>n</u> rows in the grid.  The default is one row.  If the
                     next <b>grid</b> command contains <b>^</b> characters instead of <u>content</u> that line up with the columns of
                     this <u>content</u>, then the <b>rowspan</b> of this <u>content</u> is extended by one.

              <b>-sticky</b> <u>style</u>
                     If  a  content's  cell  is larger than its requested dimensions, this option may be used to
                     position (or stretch) the content within its cell.  <u>Style</u>  is a string that  contains  zero
                     or  more  of  the  characters  <b>n</b>,  <b>s</b>,  <b>e</b> or <b>w</b>.  The string can optionally contain spaces or
                     commas, but they are ignored.  Each letter refers to a side (north, south, east,  or  west)
                     that  the content will “stick” to.  If both <b>n</b> and <b>s</b> (or <b>e</b> and <b>w</b>) are specified, the content
                     will be stretched to fill the entire height (or width) of its cavity.  The  <b>-sticky</b>  option
                     subsumes  the  combination  of  <b>-anchor</b> and <b>-fill</b> that is used by <b>pack</b>.  The default is “”,
                     which causes the content to be centered in its cavity, at its requested size.

              If any of the content is already managed by the geometry manager then any unspecified options  for
              them retain their previous values rather than receiving default values.

       <b>grid</b> <b>content</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>-option</u> <u>value</u>?
              If  no  options  are  supplied,  a list of all of the content in <u>window</u> is returned, most recently
              managed first.  <u>Option</u> can be either <b>-row</b> or <b>-column</b> which causes only the content in the row  (or
              column) specified by <u>value</u> to be returned.

       <b>grid</b> <b>forget</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>window</u> <u>...</u>?
              Removes  each  of  the  <u>window</u>s from grid for its container and unmaps their windows.  The content
              will no longer be managed by the grid geometry manager.  The configuration options for that window
              are forgotten, so that if the window is managed once  more  by  the  grid  geometry  manager,  the
              initial default settings are used.

              If  the  last  content  window of the container becomes unmanaged, this will also send the virtual 2
              event <b>&lt;&lt;NoManagedChild&gt;&gt;</b> to the container; the container may choose to resize itself (or otherwise 2
              respond) to such a change.

       <b>grid</b> <b>info</b> <u>window</u>
              Returns a list whose elements are the current configuration state of the content given  by  <u>window</u>
              in  the  same option-value form that might be specified to <b>grid</b> <b>configure</b>.  The first two elements
              of the list are “<b>-in</b> <u>container</u>” where <u>container</u> is the windows's container window.

       <b>grid</b> <b>location</b> <u>window</u> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
              Given  <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> values in screen units relative to the container window, the column and row  number
              at  that <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> location is returned. For locations that are above or to the left of the grid, <b>-1</b>
              is returned.

       <b>grid</b> <b>propagate</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>boolean</u>?
              If <u>boolean</u> has a true boolean value such as <b>1</b> or <b>on</b> then propagation is enabled for <u>window</u>,  which
              must be a window name (see <b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>PROPAGATION</b> below).  If <u>boolean</u> has a false boolean value then
              propagation  is  disabled  for  <u>window</u>.  In either of these cases an empty string is returned.  If
              <u>boolean</u> is omitted then the command returns <b>0</b> or <b>1</b> to indicate whether  propagation  is  currently
              enabled for <u>window</u>.

              Propagation is enabled by default.

       <b>grid</b> <b>rowconfigure</b> <u>window</u> <u>index</u> ?<u>-option</u> <u>value...</u>?
              Query  or  set  the  row properties of the <u>index</u> row of the geometry container, <u>window</u>.  The valid
              options are <b>-minsize</b>, <b>-weight</b>, <b>-uniform</b> and <b>-pad</b>.  If one or more options are provided, then <u>index</u>
              may be given as a list of row indices to which the configuration options will operate on.  Indices
              may be integers, window names or the keyword <u>all</u>. For <u>all</u> the options apply to all rows  currently
              occupied  by  content  windows.  For  a  window name, that window must be a content window of this
              container and the options apply to all rows currently  occupied  by  the  container  window.   The
              <b>-minsize</b>  option sets the minimum size, in screen units, that will be permitted for this row.  The
              <b>-weight</b> option (an integer value) sets the relative weight for apportioning any extra spaces among
              rows.  A weight of zero (0) indicates the row will not deviate from its  requested  size.   A  row
              whose  weight  is  two  will  grow  at  twice  the rate as a row of weight one when extra space is
              allocated to the layout.  The <b>-uniform</b> option, when a non-empty value is supplied, places the  row
              in  a  <u>uniform</u>  <u>group</u>  with  other rows that have the same value for <b>-uniform</b>.  The space for rows
              belonging to a uniform group is allocated so that their sizes are always in strict  proportion  to
              their  <b>-weight</b>  values.   See  <b>THE</b>  <b>GRID</b>  <b>ALGORITHM</b>  below  for  further details.  The <b>-pad</b> option
              specifies the number of screen units that will be added to the largest window contained completely
              in that row when the grid geometry manager requests a size from the containing window.  If only an
              option is specified, with no value, the current value of that option is  returned.   If  only  the
              container  window  and  index  is  specified,  all  the current settings are returned in a list of
              “-option value” pairs.

       <b>grid</b> <b>remove</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>window</u> <u>...</u>?
              Removes each of the <u>window</u>s from grid for its container and unmaps  their  windows.   The  content
              will  no  longer  be managed by the grid geometry manager.  However, the configuration options for
              that window are remembered, so that if the content  window  is  managed  once  more  by  the  grid
              geometry manager, the previous values are retained.

              If  the  last  content  window of the container becomes unmanaged, this will also send the virtual 2
              event <b>&lt;&lt;NoManagedChild&gt;&gt;</b> to the container; the container may choose to resize itself (or otherwise 2
              respond) to such a change.

       <b>grid</b> <b>size</b> <u>container</u>
              Returns the size of the grid (in columns then rows) for <u>container</u>.  The size is determined  either
              by  the <u>content</u> occupying the largest row or column, or the largest column or row with a <b>-minsize</b>,
              <b>-weight</b>, or <b>-pad</b> that is non-zero.

       <b>grid</b> <b>slaves</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>-option</u> <u>value</u>?
              Synonym for <b>grid</b> <b>content</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>-option</u> <u>value</u>?.

</pre><h4><b>RELATIVE</b> <b>PLACEMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>grid</b> command contains a limited set of  capabilities  that  permit  layouts  to  be  created  without
       specifying  the  row  and  column  information  for each content.  This permits content to be rearranged,
       added, or removed without the need to explicitly specify row and column information.  When no  column  or
       row  information is specified for a <u>content</u>, default values are chosen for <b>-column</b>, <b>-row</b>, <b>-columnspan</b> and
       <b>-rowspan</b> at the time the <u>content</u> is managed. The values are chosen based upon the current layout  of  the
       grid,  the  position of the <u>content</u> relative to other <u>content</u>s in the same grid command, and the presence
       of the characters <b>-</b>, <b>x</b>, and <b>^</b> in <b>grid</b> command where <u>content</u> names are normally expected.

              <b>-</b>      This increases the <b>-columnspan</b> of the <u>content</u> to the left.   Several  <b>-</b>'s  in  a  row  will
                     successively  increase  the  number of columns spanned.  A <b>-</b> may not follow a <b>^</b> or a <b>x</b>, nor
                     may it be the first <u>content</u> argument to <b>grid</b> <b>configure</b>.

              <b>x</b>      This leaves an empty column between the <u>content</u> on the left and the <u>content</u> on the right.

              <b>^</b>      This extends the <b>-rowspan</b> of the <u>content</u> above the <b>^</b>'s in the grid.  The number of <b>^</b>'s in a
                     row must match the number of columns spanned by the <u>content</u> above it.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>GRID</b> <b>ALGORITHM</b></h4><pre>
       The grid geometry manager lays out its content in three steps.  In  the  first  step,  the  minimum  size
       needed  to  fit  all of the content is computed, then (if propagation is turned on), a request is made of
       the container window to become that size.  In the second step, the requested size is compared against the
       actual size of the container.  If the sizes are different, then spaces is added to or taken away from the
       layout as needed.  For the final step, each content is positioned in its row(s) and  column(s)  based  on
       the setting of its <u>sticky</u> flag.

       To  compute  the  minimum  size  of  a layout, the grid geometry manager first looks at all content whose
       <b>-columnspan</b> and <b>-rowspan</b> values are one, and computes the nominal size of each row or column to be either
       the <u>minsize</u> for that row or column, or the sum of the <u>pad</u>ding plus  the  size  of  the  largest  content,
       whichever  is  greater.   After that the rows or columns in each uniform group adapt to each other.  Then
       the content whose row-spans or column-spans are greater than one are examined.  If a  group  of  rows  or
       columns  need to be increased in size in order to accommodate these content, then extra space is added to
       each row or column in the group according to its <u>weight</u>.  For each group whose weights are all zero,  the
       additional space is apportioned equally.

       When  multiple  rows  or  columns  belong  to  a  uniform group, the space allocated to them is always in
       proportion to their weights. (A weight of zero is considered to be 1.)  In other words, a row  or  column
       configured  with  <b>-weight</b>  <b>1</b>  <b>-uniform</b>  <b>a</b>  will  have  exactly  the  same size as any other row or column
       configured with <b>-weight</b> <b>1</b> <b>-uniform</b> <b>a</b>.  A row or column configured with  <b>-weight</b>  <b>2</b>  <b>-uniform</b>  <b>b</b>  will  be
       exactly twice as large as one that is configured with <b>-weight</b> <b>1</b> <b>-uniform</b> <b>b</b>.

       More technically, each row or column in the group will have a size equal to <u>k*weight</u> for some constant <u>k</u>.
       The constant <u>k</u> is chosen so that no row or column becomes smaller than its minimum size.  For example, if
       all  rows  or columns in a group have the same weight, then each row or column will have the same size as
       the largest row or column in the group.

       For containers whose size is larger than the  requested  layout,  the  additional  space  is  apportioned
       according to the row and column weights.  If all of the weights are zero, the layout is placed within its
       container according to the <u>anchor</u> value.  For containers whose size is smaller than the requested layout,
       space  is  taken  away  from  columns and rows according to their weights.  However, once a column or row
       shrinks to its minsize, its weight is taken to be zero.  If more space needs to be removed from a  layout
       than would be permitted, as when all the rows or columns are at their minimum sizes, the layout is placed
       and clipped according to the <u>anchor</u> value.

</pre><h4><b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>PROPAGATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  grid geometry manager normally computes how large a container must be to just exactly meet the needs
       of its content, and it sets the requested width and height of the container to  these  dimensions.   This
       causes  geometry information to propagate up through a window hierarchy to a top-level window so that the
       entire sub-tree sizes itself to fit the needs of the leaf windows.  However, the <b>grid</b>  <b>propagate</b>  command
       may  be  used  to  turn off propagation for one or more containers.  If propagation is disabled then grid
       will not set the requested width and height of the container window.  This may be useful if, for example,
       you wish for a container window to have a fixed size that you specify.

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b> <b>ON</b> <b>CONTAINER</b> <b>WINDOWS</b></h4><pre>
       The container for each content must either be the content's parent (the default) or a descendant  of  the
       content's  parent.   This  restriction  is necessary to guarantee that the content can be placed over any
       part of its container that is visible without danger of the content being  clipped  by  its  parent.   In
       addition, all content in one call to <b>grid</b> must have the same container.

</pre><h4><b>STACKING</b> <b>ORDER</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  container  for a content is not its parent then you must make sure that the content is higher in
       the stacking order than the container.  Otherwise the container will obscure  the  content  and  it  will
       appear  as  if  the  content has not been managed correctly.  The easiest way to make sure the content is
       higher than the container is to create the container window first:  the most recently created window will
       be highest in the stacking order.

</pre><h4><b>CREDITS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>grid</b> command is based on ideas taken from the <u>GridBag</u> geometry manager written by  Doug.  Stein,  and
       the <b>blt_table</b> geometry manager, written by George Howlett.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       A toplevel window containing a text widget and two scrollbars:

              # Make the widgets
              toplevel .t
              text .t.txt -wrap none -xscroll {.t.h set} -yscroll {.t.v set}
              scrollbar .t.v -orient vertical   -command {.t.txt yview}
              scrollbar .t.h -orient horizontal -command {.t.txt xview}

              # Lay them out
              <b>grid</b> .t.txt .t.v -sticky nsew
              <b>grid</b> .t.h        -sticky nsew

              # Tell the text widget to take all the extra room
              <b>grid</b> <b>rowconfigure</b>    .t .t.txt -weight 1
              <b>grid</b> <b>columnconfigure</b> .t .t.txt -weight 1

       Three widgets of equal width, despite their different “natural” widths:

              button .b -text "Foo"
              entry .e -textvariable foo ; set foo "Hello World!"
              label .l -text "This is a fairly long piece of text"

              <b>grid</b> .b .e .l -sticky ew
              <b>grid</b> <b>columnconfigure</b> . "all" -uniform allTheSame
