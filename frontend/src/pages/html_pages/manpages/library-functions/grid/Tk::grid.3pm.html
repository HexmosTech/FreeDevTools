       Tk::grid - Geometry manager that arranges widgets in a grid

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>grid</b>?(?<u>widget</u> ...,? ?<u>arg</u> ?...&gt;?)?

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>grid</b><u>Option</u>?(<u>arg</u> ?,<u>arg</u> ...?)?

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>grid</b> method is used to communicate with the grid geometry manager that arranges widgets in rows and
       columns inside of another window, called the geometry master (or master window).  The <b>grid</b> method can
       have any of several forms, depending on the <u>option</u> argument:

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>grid</b>(?<u>$slave,</u> <u>...</u>??, <u>options</u>?)
           The arguments consist of the optional references to more slave windows followed by pairs of arguments
           that  specify  how  to  manage the slaves.  The characters <b>-</b>,  <b>x</b> and <b>^</b>, can be specified instead of a
           window reference to alter the default location of a <u>$slave</u>, as  described  in  "RELATIVE  PLACEMENT",
           below.

           If  any  of  the  slaves are already managed by the geometry manager then any unspecified options for
           them retain their previous values rather than receiving default values.

           The following options are supported:

           <b>-column</b> =&gt; <u>n</u>
                   Insert the <u>$slave</u> so that it occupies the <u>n</u>th column in the grid.  Column numbers start  with
                   0.  If this option is not supplied, then the <u>$slave</u> is arranged just to the right of previous
                   slave  specified  on  this  call to <b>grid</b>, or column "0" if it is the first slave.  For each <b>x</b>
                   that immediately precedes the <u>$slave</u>, the column position is incremented by one.  Thus the  <b>x</b>
                   represents a blank column for this row in the grid.

           <b>-columnspan</b> =&gt; <u>n</u>
                   Insert  the  slave  so  that  it  occupies <u>n</u> columns in the grid.  The default is one column,
                   unless the window name is followed by a <b>-</b>, in which case the columnspan is  incremented  once
                   for each immediately following <b>-</b>.

           <b>-in</b> =&gt; <u>$other</u>
                   Insert  the  slave(s) in the master window given by <u>$other</u>.  The default is the first slave's
                   parent window.

           <b>-ipadx</b> =&gt; <u>amount</u>
                   The <u>amount</u> specifies how much horizontal internal padding  to  leave  on  each  side  of  the
                   slave(s).   This  is  space  is added inside the slave(s) border.  The <u>amount</u> must be a valid
                   screen distance, such as <b>2</b> or <b>'.5c'</b>.  It defaults to 0.

           <b>-ipady</b> =&gt; <u>amount</u>
                   The <u>amount</u> specifies how much vertical internal padding to leave on on the top and bottom  of
                   the slave(s).  This space is added inside the slave(s) border.  The <u>amount</u>  defaults to 0.

           <b>-padx</b> =&gt; <u>amount</u>
                   The  <u>amount</u>  specifies  how  much  horizontal  external  padding to leave on each side of the
                   slave(s), in screen units.  The <u>amount</u> defaults to  0.   This  space  is  added  outside  the
                   slave(s) border.

           <b>-pady</b> =&gt; <u>amount</u>
                   The <u>amount</u> specifies how much vertical external padding to leave on the top and bottom of the
                   slave(s),  in  screen  units.   The  <u>amount</u>  defaults  to 0.  This space is added outside the
                   slave(s) border.

           <b>-row</b> =&gt; <u>n</u>
                   Insert the slave so that it occupies the <u>n</u>th row in the grid.  Row numbers start with 0.   If
                   this option is not supplied, then the slave is arranged on the same row as the previous slave
                   specified on this call to <b>grid</b>, or the first unoccupied row if this is the first slave.

           <b>-rowspan</b> =&gt; <u>n</u>
                   Insert  the  slave  so  that it occupies <u>n</u> rows in the grid.  The default is one row.  If the
                   next <b>grid</b> method contains <b>^</b> characters instead of <u>$slave</u>s that line up with  the  columns  of
                   this <u>$slave</u>, then the <b>rowspan</b> of this <u>$slave</u> is extended by one.

           <b>-sticky</b> =&gt; <u>style</u>
                   If  a  slave's  cell  is  larger  than  its  requested dimensions, this option may be used to
                   position (or stretch) the slave within its cell.  <u>Style</u>  is a string that  contains  zero  or
                   more of the characters <b>n</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>e</b> or <b>w</b>.  The string can optionally contain spaces or commas, but
                   they  are ignored.  Each letter refers to a side (north, south, east, or west) that the slave
                   will "stick" to.  If both <b>n</b> and <b>s</b> (or <b>e</b> and <b>w</b>) are specified, the slave will be stretched  to
                   fill  the entire height (or width) of its cavity.  The <b>sticky</b> option subsumes the combination
                   of <b>-anchor</b> and <b>-fill</b> that is used by pack.  The default is <b>''</b>, which causes the slave  to  be
                   centered in its cavity, at its requested size.

       <u>$master</u>-&gt;<b>gridBbox</b>(?<u>column,</u> <u>row</u>,? ?<u>column2,</u> <u>row2</u>?)
           With  no  arguments, the bounding box (in pixels) of the grid is returned.  The return value consists
           of 4 integers.  The first two are the pixel offset from the master window (x then y) of the  top-left
           corner of the grid, and the second two integers are the width and height of the grid, also in pixels.
           If  a  single <u>column</u> and <u>row</u> is specified on the command line, then the bounding box for that cell is
           returned, where the top left cell is numbered from zero.   If  both  <u>column</u>  and  <u>row</u>  arguments  are
           specified, then the bounding box spanning the rows and columns indicated is returned.

       <u>$master</u>-&gt;<b>gridColumnconfigure</b>(<u>index</u>?, <u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           Query  or  set  the column properties of the <u>index</u> column of the geometry master, <u>$master</u>.  The valid
           options are <b>-minsize</b>, <b>-weight</b> and <b>-pad</b>.  If one or more options are provided, then <u>index</u> may be given
           as a list of column indices to which the configuration options will operate on.  The <b>-minsize</b>  option
           sets  the  minimum size, in screen units, that will be permitted for this column.  The <b>-weight</b> option
           (an integer value) sets the relative weight for apportioning  any  extra  spaces  among  columns.   A
           weight  of  zero  (0)  indicates the column will not deviate from its requested size.  A column whose
           weight is two will grow at twice the rate as a column of weight one when extra space is allocated  to
           the  layout.   The <b>-uniform</b> option,  when  a non-empty  value  is  supplied,  places  the column in a
           <u>uniform</u> <u>group</u> with other columns that have the same value  for  <b>-uniform</b>.   The   space  for  columns
           belonging  to  a uniform group is allocated so that their sizes are always in  strict  proportion  to
           their <b>-weight</b> values.   See  <u>THE</u> <u>GRID</u> <u>ALGORITHM</u> below for further details.  The <b>-pad</b> option specifies
           the number of screen units that will be added to the largest  window  contained  completely  in  that
           column  when the grid geometry manager requests a size from the containing window.  If only an option
           is specified, with no value, the current value of that option is returned.  If only the master window
           and index is specified, all the current settings are returned in an list of "-option value" pairs.

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>gridConfigure</b>(?<u>$slave,</u> <u>...</u>?, <u>options</u>?)
           The same as <b>grid</b> method.

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>gridForget</b>?(<u>$slave,</u> <u>...</u>)?
           Removes each of the <u>$slave</u>s from grid for its master and unmaps their windows.  The  slaves  will  no
           longer  be  managed  by  the  grid  geometry  manager.  The configuration options for that window are
           forgotten, so that if the slave is managed once more  by  the  grid  geometry  manager,  the  initial
           default settings are used.

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>gridInfo</b>
           Returns a list whose elements are the current configuration state of the slave given by <u>$slave</u> in the
           same  option-value form that might be specified to <b>gridConfigure</b>.  The first two elements of the list
           are ``<b>-in</b>=&gt;<u>$master</u>'' where <u>$master</u> is the slave's master.

       <u>$master</u>-&gt;<b>gridLocation</b>(<u>x,</u> <u>y</u>)
           Given  <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> values in screen units relative to the master window, the column  and  row  number  at
           that  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u> location is returned.  For locations that are above or to the left of the grid, <b>-1</b> is
           returned.

       <u>$master</u>-&gt;<b>gridPropagate</b>?(<u>boolean</u>)?
           If <u>boolean</u> has a true boolean value such as <b>1</b> or <b>on</b> then propagation is enabled  for  <u>$master</u>,  which
           must  be a window name (see "GEOMETRY PROPAGATION" below).  If <u>boolean</u> has a false boolean value then
           propagation is disabled for <u>$master</u>.  In either of these cases  an  empty  string  is  returned.   If
           <u>boolean</u>  is  omitted  then  the  method  returns  <b>0</b> or <b>1</b> to indicate whether propagation is currently
           enabled for <u>$master</u>.  Propagation is enabled by default.

       <u>$master</u>-&gt;<b>gridRowconfigure</b>(<u>index</u>?, <u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           Query or set the row properties of the <u>index</u> row of the geometry master, <u>$master</u>.  The valid  options
           are  <b>-minsize</b>,  <b>-weight</b>  and <b>-pad</b>.  If one or more options are provided, then <u>index</u> may be given as a
           list of row indeces to which the configuration options will operate on.  The <b>-minsize</b> option sets the
           minimum size, in screen units, that will be permitted for this row.  The <b>-weight</b> option  (an  integer
           value)  sets  the relative weight for apportioning any extra spaces among rows.  A weight of zero (0)
           indicates the row will not deviate from its requested size.  A row whose weight is two will  grow  at
           twice  the  rate  as  a  row of weight one when extra space is allocated to the layout.  The <b>-uniform</b>
           option, when a non-empty value is supplied, places the row in a <u>uniform</u> <u>group</u> with  other  rows  that
           have  the same  value for <b>-uniform</b>.   The space for rows belonging to a uniform group is allocated so
           that their sizes are always in strict proportion to  their <b>-weight</b> values.  See  <u>THE</u>  <u>GRID</u>  <u>ALGORITHM</u>
           below  for  further details.  The <b>-pad</b> option specifies the number of screen units that will be added
           to the largest window contained completely in that row when the grid geometry manager requests a size
           from the containing window.  If only an option is specified, with no value, the current value of that
           option is returned.  If only the master window and index is specified, all the current  settings  are
           returned in an list of "option-value" pairs.

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>gridRemove</b>?(<u>$slave,</u> <u>...</u>)?
           Removes  each  of  the <u>$slave</u>s from grid for its master and unmaps their windows.  The slaves will no
           longer be managed by the grid geometry manager.  However, the configuration options for  that  window
           are  remembered, so that if the slave is managed once more by the grid geometry manager, the previous
           values are retained.

       <u>$master</u>-&gt;<b>gridSize</b>
           Returns the size of the grid (in columns then rows) for <u>$master</u>.  The size is  determined  either  by
           the  <u>$slave</u>  occupying  the  largest  row  or  column,  or the largest column or row with a <b>-minsize</b>,
           <b>-weight</b>, or <b>-pad</b> that is non-zero.

       <u>$master</u>-&gt;<b>gridSlaves</b>?(<u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u>)?
           If no options are supplied, a list of all of the  slaves  in  <u>$master</u>  are  returned,  most  recently
           manages  first.   <u>-option</u>  can  be either <b>-row</b> or <b>-column</b> which causes only the slaves in the row (or
           column) specified by <u>value</u> to be returned.

</pre><h4><b>RELATIVE</b> <b>PLACEMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>grid</b> method contains a limited set  of  capabilities  that  permit  layouts  to  be  created  without
       specifying  the  row and column information for each slave.  This permits slaves to be rearranged, added,
       or removed without the need to explicitly specify row and column information.   When  no  column  or  row
       information  is  specified  for  a  <u>$slave</u>,  default values are chosen for <b>-column</b>, <b>-row</b>, <b>-columnspan</b> and
       <b>-rowspan</b> at the time the <u>$slave</u> is managed. The values are chosen based upon the current  layout  of  the
       grid,  the  position of the <u>$slave</u> relative to other <u>$slave</u>s in the same grid method, and the presence of
       the characters <b>-</b>, <b>^</b>, and <b>^</b> in <b>grid</b> method where <u>$slave</u> names are normally expected.

       <b>-</b>   This increases the columnspan of the <u>$slave</u> to the left.  Several <b>-</b>'s  in  a  row  will  successively
           increase the columnspan. A <b>-</b> may not follow a <b>^</b> or a <b>x</b>.

       <b>x</b>   This leaves an empty column between the <u>$slave</u> on the left and the <u>$slave</u> on the right.

       <b>^</b>   This  extends  the <b>-rowspan</b> of the <u>$slave</u> above the <b>^</b>'s in the grid.  The number of <b>^</b>'s in a row must
           match the number of columns spanned by the <u>$slave</u> above it.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>GRID</b> <b>ALGORITHM</b></h4><pre>
       The grid geometry manager lays out its slaves in three steps.  In the first step, the minimum size needed
       to fit all of the slaves is computed, then (if propagation is turned on), a request is made of the master
       window to become that size.  In the second step, the requested size is compared against the  actual  size
       of  the  master.   If  the  sizes  are different, then space is added to or taken away from the layout as
       needed.  For the final step, each slave is positioned in its row(s) and column(s) based on the setting of
       its <u>sticky</u> flag.

       To compute the minimum size of a layout, the grid geometry  manager  first  looks  at  all  slaves  whose
       columnspan  and  rowspan values are one, and computes the nominal size of each row or column to be either
       the <u>minsize</u> for that row or column, or the sum of the  <u>pad</u>ding  plus  the  size  of  the  largest  slave,
       whichever  is  greater.  Then the slaves whose rowspans or columnspans are greater than one are examined.
       If a group of rows or columns need to be increased in size in order to  accommodate  these  slaves,  then
       extra  space  is  added to each row or column in the group according to its <u>weight</u>.  For each group whose
       weights are all zero, the additional space is apportioned equally.

       When multiple rows or columns belong to a uniform group,  the  space  allocated  to  them  is  always  in
       proportion  to  their weights. (A weight of zero is considered to be 1.)  In other words, a row or column
       configured with <b>-weight</b> <b>1</b> <b>-uniform</b> a will have  exactly  the  same  size  as  any  other  row  or  column
       configured  with  <b>-weight</b>  <b>1</b>  <b>-uniform</b>  <b>a</b>.   A row or column configured with <b>-weight</b> <b>2</b> <b>-uniform</b> <b>b</b> will be
       exactly twice as large as one that is configured with <b>-weight</b> <b>1</b> <b>-uniform</b> <b>b</b>.

       More technically, each row or column in the group will have a size equal to <u>k*weight</u> for some constant k.
       The constant k is chosen so that no row or column becomes smaller than its minimum size.  For example, if
       all rows or columns in a group have the same weight, then each row or column will have the same  size  as
       the largest row or column in the group.

       For masters whose size is larger than the requested layout, the additional space is apportioned according
       to the row and column weights.  If all of the weights are zero, the layout is centered within its master.
       For  masters  whose  size is smaller than the requested layout, space is taken away from columns and rows
       according to their weights.  However, once a column or row shrinks to its minsize, its weight is taken to
       be zero.  If more space needs to be removed from a layout than would be permitted, as when all  the  rows
       or columns are at there minimum sizes, the layout is clipped on the bottom and right.

</pre><h4><b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>PROPAGATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  grid geometry manager normally computes how large a master must be to just exactly meet the needs of
       its slaves, and it sets the requested width and height of the master to these  dimensions.   This  causes
       geometry  information to propagate up through a window hierarchy to a top-level window so that the entire
       sub-tree sizes itself to fit the needs of the leaf windows.  However, the  <b>gridPropagate</b>  method  may  be
       used  to turn off propagation for one or more masters.  If propagation is disabled then grid will not set
       the requested width and height of the master window.  This may be useful if, for example, you wish for  a
       master window to have a fixed size that you specify.

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b> <b>ON</b> <b>MASTER</b> <b>WINDOWS</b></h4><pre>
       The  master for each slave must either be the slave's parent (the default) or a descendant of the slave's
       parent.  This restriction is necessary to guarantee that the slave can be placed over  any  part  of  its
       master  that is visible without danger of the slave being clipped by its parent.  In addition, all slaves
       in one call to <b>grid</b> must have the same master.

</pre><h4><b>STACKING</b> <b>ORDER</b></h4><pre>
       If the master for a slave is not its parent then you must make sure that  the  slave  is  higher  in  the
       stacking order than the master.  Otherwise the master will obscure the slave and it will appear as if the
       slave hasn't been managed correctly.  The easiest way to make sure the slave is higher than the master is
       to  create  the  master  window  first:  the most recently created window will be highest in the stacking
       order.
