</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pcap_findalldevs, pcap_freealldevs - get a list of capture devices, and free that list

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>char</b> <b>errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>pcap_findalldevs(pcap_if_t</b> <b>**alldevsp,</b> <b>char</b> <b>*errbuf);</b>
       <b>void</b> <b>pcap_freealldevs(pcap_if_t</b> <b>*alldevs);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pcap_findalldevs</b>()  constructs  a  list of network devices that can be opened with <b><a href="../man3PCAP/pcap_create.3PCAP.html">pcap_create</a></b>(3PCAP) and
       <b><a href="../man3PCAP/pcap_activate.3PCAP.html">pcap_activate</a></b>(3PCAP) or with <b><a href="../man3PCAP/pcap_open_live.3PCAP.html">pcap_open_live</a></b>(3PCAP).  (Note that there may be network devices that  cannot
       be  opened  by  the  process calling <b>pcap_findalldevs</b>(), because, for example, that process does not have
       sufficient privileges to open them for capturing; if so, those devices will  not  appear  on  the  list.)
       <u>alldevsp</u> is a pointer to a <b>pcap_if_t</b> <b>*</b>; <u>errbuf</u> is a buffer large enough to hold at least <b>PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE</b>
       chars.

       If  <b>pcap_findalldevs</b>()  succeeds, the pointer pointed to by <u>alldevsp</u> is set to point to the first element
       of the list, or to <b>NULL</b> if no devices were found (this is considered success).  Each element of the  list
       is of type <b>pcap_if_t</b>, and has the following members:

              <b>next</b>   if  not  <b>NULL</b>,  a pointer to the next element in the list; <b>NULL</b> for the last element of the
                     list

              <b>name</b>   a pointer to a string giving a name for the device to pass to <b>pcap_open_live</b>()

              <b>description</b>
                     if not <b>NULL</b>, a pointer to a string giving a human-readable description of the device

              <b>addresses</b>
                     a pointer to the first element of a list of network addresses for the device,  or  <b>NULL</b>  if
                     the device has no addresses

              <b>flags</b>  device flags:

                     <b>PCAP_IF_LOOPBACK</b>
                            set if the device is a loopback interface

                     <b>PCAP_IF_UP</b>
                            set if the device is up

                     <b>PCAP_IF_RUNNING</b>
                            set if the device is running

                     <b>PCAP_IF_WIRELESS</b>
                            set if the device is a wireless interface; this includes IrDA as well as radio-based
                            networks such as IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11, so it doesn't just mean Wi-Fi

                     <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS</b>
                            a bitmask for an indication of whether the adapter is connected or not; for wireless
                            interfaces, "connected" means "associated with a network"

                     The possible values for the connection status bits are:

                     <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_UNKNOWN</b>
                            it's unknown whether the adapter is connected or not

                     <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_CONNECTED</b>
                            the adapter is connected

                     <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_DISCONNECTED</b>
                            the adapter is disconnected

                     <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_NOT_APPLICABLE</b>
                            the  notion  of  "connected"  and  "disconnected" don't apply to this interface; for
                            example, it doesn't apply to a loopback device

       Each element of the list of addresses is of type <b>pcap_addr_t</b>, and has the following members:

              <b>next</b>   if not <b>NULL</b>, a pointer to the next element in the list; <b>NULL</b> for the last  element  of  the
                     list

              <b>addr</b>   a pointer to a <b>struct</b> <b>sockaddr</b> containing an address

              <b>netmask</b>
                     if  not <b>NULL</b>, a pointer to a <b>struct</b> <b>sockaddr</b> that contains the netmask corresponding to the
                     address pointed to by <b>addr</b>

              <b>broadaddr</b>
                     if not  <b>NULL</b>,  a  pointer  to  a  <b>struct</b>  <b>sockaddr</b>  that  contains  the  broadcast  address
                     corresponding  to the address pointed to by <b>addr</b>; may be <b>NULL</b> if the device doesn't support
                     broadcasts

              <b>dstaddr</b>
                     if not <b>NULL</b>, a  pointer  to  a  <b>struct</b>  <b>sockaddr</b>  that  contains  the  destination  address
                     corresponding  to  the address pointed to by <b>addr</b>; may be <b>NULL</b> if the device isn't a point-
                     to-point interface

       Note that the addresses in the list of addresses might be IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses, or  some  other
       type  of addresses, so you must check the <b>sa_family</b> member of the <b>struct</b> <b>sockaddr</b> before interpreting the
       contents of the address; do not assume that the addresses are all IPv4 addresses, or  even  all  IPv4  or
       IPv6  addresses.   IPv4  addresses  have the value <b>AF_INET</b>, IPv6 addresses have the value <b>AF_INET6</b> (which
       older operating systems that don't support IPv6 might not define), and other addresses have other values.
       Whether other addresses are returned, and what types they  might  have  is  platform-dependent.   Namely,
       link-layer  addresses, such as Ethernet MAC addresses, have the value <b>AF_PACKET</b> (on Linux) or <b>AF_LINK</b> (on
       AIX, FreeBSD, Haiku, illumos, macOS, NetBSD and OpenBSD) or are not returned  at  all  (on  GNU/Hurd  and
       Solaris).

       For  IPv4  addresses,  the  <b>struct</b>  <b>sockaddr</b>  pointer  can  be  interpreted  as if it pointed to a <b>struct</b>
       <b>sockaddr_in</b>; for IPv6 addresses, it can be interpreted as if it pointed to a  <b>struct</b>  <b>sockaddr_in6</b>.   For
       link-layer addresses, it can be interpreted as if it pointed to a <b>struct</b> <b>sockaddr_ll</b> (for <b>AF_PACKET</b>) or a
       <b>struct</b> <b>sockaddr_dl</b> (for <b>AF_LINK</b>).

       The  list  of  devices  must  be  freed  with <b><a href="../man3PCAP/pcap_freealldevs.3PCAP.html">pcap_freealldevs</a></b>(3PCAP), which frees the list pointed to by
       <u>alldevs</u>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pcap_findalldevs</b>() returns <b>0</b> on success and <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> on failure; as indicated, finding  no  devices  is
       considered  success,  rather than failure, so <b>0</b> will be returned in that case. If <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> is returned,
       <u>errbuf</u> is filled in with an appropriate error message, and the pointer pointed to by <u>alldevsp</u> is  set  to
       <b>NULL</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BACKWARD</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The   <b>PCAP_IF_UP</b>   and  <b>PCAP_IF_RUNNING</b>  constants  became  available  in  libpcap  release  1.6.1.   The
       <b>PCAP_IF_WIRELESS</b>,              <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS</b>,              <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_UNKNOWN</b>,
       <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_CONNECTED</b>,              <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_DISCONNECTED</b>,             and
       <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_NOT_APPLICABLE</b> constants became available in libpcap release 1.9.0.
