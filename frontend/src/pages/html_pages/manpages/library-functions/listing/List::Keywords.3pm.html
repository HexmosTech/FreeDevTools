</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "List::Keywords" - a selection of list utility keywords

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use List::Keywords 'any';

          my @boxes = ...;

          if( any { $_-&gt;size &gt; 100 } @boxes ) {
             say "There are some large boxes here";
          }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides keywords that behave (almost) identically to familiar functions from List::Util, but
       implemented as keyword plugins instead of functions. As a result these run more efficiently, especially
       in small code cases.

   <b>Blocks</b> <b>vs</b> <b>Anonymous</b> <b>Subs</b>
       In the description above the word "almost" refers to the fact that as this module provides true keywords,
       the code blocks to them can be parsed as true blocks rather than anonymous functions. As a result, both
       "caller" and "return" will behave rather differently here.

       For example,

          use List::Keywords 'any';

          sub func {
             any { say "My caller is ", caller; return "ret" } 1, 2, 3;
             say "This is never printed";
          }

       Here, the "caller" will see "func" as its caller, and the "return" statement makes the entire containing
       function return, so the second line is never printed. The same example written using "List::Util" will
       instead print the "List::Util::any" function as being the caller, before making just that one item return
       the value, then the message on the second line is printed as normal.

       In regular operation where the code is just performing some test on each item, and does not make use of
       "caller" or "return", this should not cause any noticable differences.

   <b>Lexical</b> <b>Variable</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       Newly added in <u>version</u> <u>0.09</u> many of the functions in this module support a new syntax idea that may be
       added to Perl core eventually, whereby a lexical variable can be declared before the code block. In that
       case, this lexical variable takes the place of the global $_ for the purpose of carrying values from the
       input list.

       This syntax is currently under discussion for Perl's "map" and "grep" blocks, and may be added in a
       future release of Perl.

       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/RFCs/pull/33&gt;

   <b>Aliasing</b> <b>and</b> <b>Modification</b>
       Each time the block code is executed, the global $_ or the lexical variable being used is aliased to an
       element of the input list (in the same way as it would be for perl's "map" or "foreach" loops, for
       example). If the block attempts to modify the value of this variable, such modifications are visible in
       the input list. You almost certainly want to avoid doing this.

       For example:

          my @numbers = ...;
          my $x = first my $x { $x++ &gt; 10 } @numbers;

       This will modify values in the @numbers array, but due to the short-circuit nature of "first", will only
       have modified values up to the selected element by the time it returns. This will likely confuse later
       uses of the input array.

       Additionally, the result of "first" is also aliased to the input list, much as it is for core perl's
       "grep". This may mean that values passed in to other functions have an ability to mutate at a distance.

       For example:

          func( first { ... } @numbers );

       Here, the invoked func() may be able to modify the @numbers array, for example by modifying its own @_
       array.

   <b>Performance</b>
       The following example demonstrates a simple case and shows how the performance differs.

          my @nums = (1 .. 100);

          my $ret = any { $_ &gt; 50 } @nums;

       When run for 5 seconds each, the following results were obtained on my machine:

          List::Util::any      648083/s
          List::Keyword/any    816135/s

       The "List::Keyword" version here ran 26% faster.

</pre><h4><b>KEYWORDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>first</b>
          $val = first { CODE } LIST

       <u>Since</u> <u>verison</u> <u>0.03.</u>

       Repeatedly calls the block of code, with $_ locally set to successive values from the given list. Returns
       the value and stops at the first item to make the block yield a true value. If no such item exists,
       returns "undef".

          $val = first my $var { CODE } LIST

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.09.</u>

       Optionally the code block can be prefixed with a lexical variable declaration.  In this case, that
       variable will contain each value from the list, and the global $_ will remain untouched.

   <b>any</b>
          $bool = any { CODE } LIST

       Repeatedly calls the block of code, with $_ locally set to successive values from the given list. Returns
       true and stops at the first item to make the block yield a true value. If no such item exists, returns
       false.

          $val = any my $var { CODE } LIST

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.09.</u>

       Uses the lexical variable instead of global $_, similar to "first".

   <b>all</b>
          $bool = all { CODE } LIST

       Repeatedly calls the block of code, with $_ locally set to successive values from the given list. Returns
       false and stops at the first item to make the block yield a false value. If no such item exists, returns
       true.

          $val = all my $var { CODE } LIST

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.09.</u>

       Uses the lexical variable instead of global $_, similar to "first".

   <b>none</b>
   <b>notall</b>
          $bool = none { CODE } LIST
          $bool = notall { CODE } LISt

       <u>Since</u> <u>verison</u> <u>0.03.</u>

       Same as "any" and "all" but with the return value inverted.

          $val = none my $var { CODE } LIST
          $val = notall my $var { CODE } LIST

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.09.</u>

       Uses the lexical variable instead of global $_, similar to "first".

   <b>reduce</b>
          $final = reduce { CODE } INITIAL, LIST

       <u>Since</u> <u>verison</u> <u>0.05.</u>

       Repeatedly calls a block of code, using the $a package lexical as an accumulator and setting $b to each
       successive value from the list in turn.  The first value of the list sets the initial value of the
       accumulator, and each returned result from the code block gives its new value. The final value of the
       accumulator is returned.

   <b>reductions</b>
          @partials = reductions { CODE } INITIAL, LIST

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.06.</u>

       Similar to "reduce", but returns a full list of all the partial results of every invocation, beginning
       with the initial value itself and ending with the final result.

</pre><h4><b>N-AT-A-TIME</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following two functions are a further experiment to try out n-at-a-time lexical variable support on
       the core "grep" and "map" operators. They are differently named, because keyword plugins cannot replace
       existing core keywords, only add new ones.

   <b>ngrep</b>
          @values = ngrep my ($var1, $var2, ...) { CODE } LIST

          $values = ngrep my ($var1, $var2, ...) { CODE } LIST

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.10.</u>

       A variation on core's "grep", which uses lexical variable syntax to request a number of items at once.
       The input list is broken into bundles sized according to the number of variables declared. The block of
       code is called in scalar context with the variables set to each corresponding bundle of values, and the
       bundles for which the block returned true are saved for the resulting list.

       In scalar context, returns the number of values that would have been present in the resulting list (i.e.
       this is not the same as the number of times the block returned true).

   <b>nmap</b>
          @results = nmap my ($var1, $var2, ...) { CODE } LIST

          $results = nmap my ($var1, $var2, ...) { CODE } LIST

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.10.</u>

       A variation on core's "map", which uses lexical variable syntax to request a number of items at once. The
       input list is broken into bundles sized according to the number of variables declared. The block of code
       is called in list context with the variables set to each corresponding bundle of values, and the results
       of the block from each bundle are concatenated together to form the result list.

       In scalar context, returns the number of values that would have been present in the resulting list.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       More functions from "List::Util":

          pairfirst pairgrep pairmap

       Maybe also consider some from List::UtilsBy.
