</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       List::MoreUtils - Provide the stuff missing in List::Util

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # import specific functions

           use List::MoreUtils qw(any uniq);

           if ( any { /foo/ } uniq @has_duplicates ) {
               # do stuff
           }

           # import everything

           use List::MoreUtils ':all';

           # import by API

           # has "original" any/all/none/notall behavior
           use List::MoreUtils ':like_0.22';
           # 0.22 + bsearch
           use List::MoreUtils ':like_0.24';
           # has "simplified" any/all/none/notall behavior + (n)sort_by
           use List::MoreUtils ':like_0.33';

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>List::MoreUtils</b> provides some trivial but commonly needed functionality on lists which is not going to go
       into List::Util.

       All of the below functions are implementable in only a couple of lines of Perl code. Using the functions
       from this module however should give slightly better performance as everything is implemented in C. The
       pure-Perl implementation of these functions only serves as a fallback in case the C portions of this
       module couldn't be compiled on this machine.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Default</b> <b>behavior</b>
       Nothing by default. To import all of this module's symbols use the ":all" tag.  Otherwise functions can
       be imported by name as usual:

           use List::MoreUtils ':all';

           use List::MoreUtils qw{ any firstidx };

       Because historical changes to the API might make upgrading List::MoreUtils difficult for some projects,
       the legacy API is available via special import tags.

   <b>Like</b> <b>version</b> <b>0.22</b> <b>(last</b> <b>release</b> <b>with</b> <b>original</b> <b>API)</b>
       This API was available from 2006 to 2009, returning undef for empty lists on "all"/"any"/"none"/"notall":

           use List::MoreUtils ':like_0.22';

       This import tag will import all functions available as of version 0.22.  However, it will import "any_u"
       as "any", "all_u" as "all", "none_u" as "none", and "notall_u" as "notall".

   <b>Like</b> <b>version</b> <b>0.24</b> <b>(first</b> <b>incompatible</b> <b>change)</b>
       This API was available from 2010 to 2011.  It changed the return value of "none" and added the "bsearch"
       function.

           use List::MoreUtils ':like_0.24';

       This import tag will import all functions available as of version 0.24.  However it will import "any_u"
       as "any", "all_u" as "all", and "notall_u" as "notall".  It will import "none" as described in the
       documentation below (true for empty list).

   <b>Like</b> <b>version</b> <b>0.33</b> <b>(second</b> <b>incompatible</b> <b>change)</b>
       This API was available from 2011 to 2014. It is widely used in several CPAN modules and thus it's closest
       to the current API.  It changed the return values of "any", "all", and "notall".  It added the "sort_by"
       and "nsort_by" functions and the "distinct" alias for "uniq".  It omitted "bsearch".

           use List::MoreUtils ':like_0.33';

       This import tag will import all functions available as of version 0.33.  Note: it will not import
       "bsearch" for consistency with the 0.33 API.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Junctions</b>
       <u>Treatment</u> <u>of</u> <u>an</u> <u>empty</u> <u>list</u>

       There are two schools of thought for how to evaluate a junction on an empty list:

       •   Reduction to an identity (boolean)

       •   Result is undefined (three-valued)

       In  the  first case, the result of the junction applied to the empty list is determined by a mathematical
       reduction to an identity depending on whether the underlying comparison is "or" or "and".  Conceptually:

                           "any are true"      "all are true"
                           --------------      --------------
           2 elements:     A || B || 0         A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; 1
           1 element:      A || 0              A &amp;&amp; 1
           0 elements:     0                   1

       In the second case, three-value logic is desired, in which a junction applied to an  empty  list  returns
       "undef" rather than true or false

       Junctions with a "_u" suffix implement three-valued logic.  Those without are boolean.

       <u>all</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>all_u</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  a  true value if all items in LIST meet the criterion given through BLOCK. Sets $_ for each item
       in LIST in turn:

         print "All values are non-negative"
           if all { $_ &gt;= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);

       For an empty LIST, "all" returns true (i.e. no values failed the condition) and "all_u" returns "undef".

       Thus, "all_u(@list)" is equivalent to "@list ? all(@list) : undef".

       <b>Note</b>: because Perl treats "undef" as false, you must check the return value of "all_u" with "defined"  or
       you will get the opposite result of what you expect.

       <u>any</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>any_u</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  a  true value if any item in LIST meets the criterion given through BLOCK. Sets $_ for each item
       in LIST in turn:

         print "At least one non-negative value"
           if any { $_ &gt;= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);

       For an empty LIST, "any" returns false and "any_u" returns "undef".

       Thus, "any_u(@list)" is equivalent to "@list ? any(@list) : undef".

       <u>none</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>none_u</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Logically the negation of "any". Returns a true value if no  item  in  LIST  meets  the  criterion  given
       through BLOCK. Sets $_ for each item in LIST in turn:

         print "No non-negative values"
           if none { $_ &gt;= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);

       For  an  empty  LIST,  "none"  returns  true  (i.e.  no values failed the condition) and "none_u" returns
       "undef".

       Thus, "none_u(@list)" is equivalent to "@list ? none(@list) : undef".

       <b>Note</b>: because Perl treats "undef" as false, you must check the return value of "none_u" with "defined" or
       you will get the opposite result of what you expect.

       <u>notall</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>notall_u</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Logically the negation of "all". Returns a true value if not all items in LIST meet the  criterion  given
       through BLOCK. Sets $_ for each item in LIST in turn:

         print "Not all values are non-negative"
           if notall { $_ &gt;= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);

       For an empty LIST, "notall" returns false and "notall_u" returns "undef".

       Thus, "notall_u(@list)" is equivalent to "@list ? notall(@list) : undef".

       <u>one</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>one_u</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  a  true value if precisely one item in LIST meets the criterion given through BLOCK. Sets $_ for
       each item in LIST in turn:

           print "Precisely one value defined"
               if one { defined($_) } @list;

       Returns false otherwise.

       For an empty LIST, "one" returns false and "one_u" returns "undef".

       The expression "one BLOCK LIST" is almost equivalent to "1 == true BLOCK LIST", except for short-cutting.
       Evaluation of BLOCK will immediately stop at the second true value.

   <b>Transformation</b>
       <u>apply</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Applies BLOCK to each item in LIST and returns a list of the values after  BLOCK  has  been  applied.  In
       scalar  context, the last element is returned.  This function is similar to "map" but will not modify the
       elements of the input list:

         my @list = (1 .. 4);
         my @mult = apply { $_ *= 2 } @list;
         print "\@list = @list\n";
         print "\@mult = @mult\n";
         __END__
         @list = 1 2 3 4
         @mult = 2 4 6 8

       Think of it as syntactic sugar for

         for (my @mult = @list) { $_ *= 2 }

       <u>insert_after</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>VALUE</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Inserts VALUE after the first item in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK is true.  Sets  $_  for  each
       item in LIST in turn.

         my @list = qw/This is a list/;
         insert_after { $_ eq "a" } "longer" =&gt; @list;
         print "@list";
         __END__
         This is a longer list

       <u>insert_after_string</u> <u>STRING</u> <u>VALUE</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Inserts VALUE after the first item in LIST which is equal to STRING.

         my @list = qw/This is a list/;
         insert_after_string "a", "longer" =&gt; @list;
         print "@list";
         __END__
         This is a longer list

       <u>pairwise</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>ARRAY1</u> <u>ARRAY2</u>

       Evaluates  BLOCK  for  each  pair  of  elements in ARRAY1 and ARRAY2 and returns a new list consisting of
       BLOCK's return values. The two elements are set to $a and $b.  Note that those two  are  aliases  to  the
       original value so changing them will modify the input arrays.

         @a = (1 .. 5);
         @b = (11 .. 15);
         @x = pairwise { $a + $b } @a, @b;     # returns 12, 14, 16, 18, 20

         # mesh with pairwise
         @a = qw/a b c/;
         @b = qw/1 2 3/;
         @x = pairwise { ($a, $b) } @a, @b;    # returns a, 1, b, 2, c, 3

       <u>mesh</u> <u>ARRAY1</u> <u>ARRAY2</u> <u>[</u> <u>ARRAY3</u> <u>...</u> <u>]</u>

       <u>zip</u> <u>ARRAY1</u> <u>ARRAY2</u> <u>[</u> <u>ARRAY3</u> <u>...</u> <u>]</u>

       Returns  a  list  consisting  of  the first elements of each array, then the second, then the third, etc,
       until all arrays are exhausted.

       Examples:

         @x = qw/a b c d/;
         @y = qw/1 2 3 4/;
         @z = mesh @x, @y;         # returns a, 1, b, 2, c, 3, d, 4

         @a = ('x');
         @b = ('1', '2');
         @c = qw/zip zap zot/;
         @d = mesh @a, @b, @c;   # x, 1, zip, undef, 2, zap, undef, undef, zot

       "zip" is an alias for "mesh".

       <u>zip6</u>

       <u>zip_unflatten</u>

       Returns a list of arrays consisting of the first elements of each array, then the second, then the third,
       etc, until all arrays are exhausted.

         @x = qw/a b c d/;
         @y = qw/1 2 3 4/;
         @z = zip6 @x, @y;         # returns [a, 1], [b, 2], [c, 3], [d, 4]

         @a = ('x');
         @b = ('1', '2');
         @c = qw/zip zap zot/;
         @d = zip6 @a, @b, @c;     # [x, 1, zip], [undef, 2, zap], [undef, undef, zot]

       "zip_unflatten" is an alias for "zip6".

       <u>listcmp</u> <u>ARRAY0</u> <u>ARRAY1</u> <u>[</u> <u>ARRAY2</u> <u>...</u> <u>]</u>

       Returns an associative list of elements  and  every  <u>id</u>  of  the  list  it  was  found  in.  Allows  easy
       implementation of @a &amp; @b, @a | @b, @a ^ @b and so on.  Undefined entries in any given array are skipped.

         my @a = qw(one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen);
         my @b = qw(two three five seven eleven thirteen seventeen);
         my @c = qw(one one two three five eight thirteen twentyone);
         my %cmp = listcmp @a, @b, @c; # returns (one =&gt; [0, 2], two =&gt; [0, 1, 2], three =&gt; [0, 1, 2], four =&gt; [0], ...)

         my @seq = (1, 2, 3);
         my @prim = (undef, 2, 3, 5);
         my @fib = (1, 1, 2);
         my %cmp = listcmp @seq, @prim, @fib;
         # returns ( 1 =&gt; [0, 2], 2 =&gt; [0, 1, 2], 3 =&gt; [0, 1], 5 =&gt; [1] )

       <u>arrayify</u> <u>LIST[,LIST[,LIST...]]</u>

       Returns a list consisting of each element of given arrays. Recursive arrays are flattened, too.

         @a = (1, [[2], 3], 4, [5], 6, [7], 8, 9);
         @l = arrayify @a;         # returns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

       <u>uniq</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>distinct</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  a  new  list  by stripping duplicate values in LIST by comparing the values as hash keys, except
       that undef is considered separate from ''.  The order of elements in the returned list is the same as  in
       LIST. In scalar context, returns the number of unique elements in LIST.

         my @x = uniq 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 3, 4; # returns 1 2 3 5 4
         my $x = uniq 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 3, 4; # returns 5
         # returns "Mike", "Michael", "Richard", "Rick"
         my @n = distinct "Mike", "Michael", "Richard", "Rick", "Michael", "Rick"
         # returns "A8", "", undef, "A5", "S1"
         my @s = distinct "A8", "", undef, "A5", "S1", "A5", "A8"
         # returns "Giulia", "Giulietta", undef, "", 156, "GTA", "GTV", 159, "Brera", "4C"
         my @w = uniq "Giulia", "Giulietta", undef, "", 156, "GTA", "GTV", 159, "Brera", "4C", "Giulietta", "Giulia"

       "distinct" is an alias for "uniq".

       <b>RT#49800</b> can be used to give feedback about this behavior.

       <u>singleton</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  a  new list by stripping values in LIST occurring more than once by comparing the values as hash
       keys, except that undef is considered separate from ''.  The order of elements in the  returned  list  is
       the same as in LIST.  In scalar context, returns the number of elements occurring only once in LIST.

         my @x = singleton 1,1,2,2,3,4,5 # returns 3 4 5

       <u>duplicates</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  a new list by stripping values in LIST occurring less than twice by comparing the values as hash
       keys, except that undef is considered separate from ''.  The order of elements in the  returned  list  is
       the same as in LIST.  In scalar context, returns the number of elements occurring more than once in LIST.

         my @y = duplicates 1,1,2,4,7,2,3,4,6,9; #returns 1,2,4

       <u>frequency</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns an associative list of distinct values and the corresponding frequency.

         my @f = frequency values %radio_nrw; # returns (
         #  'Deutschlandfunk (DLF)' =&gt; 9, 'WDR 3' =&gt; 10,
         #  'WDR 4' =&gt; 11, 'WDR 5' =&gt; 14, 'WDR Eins Live' =&gt; 14,
         #  'Deutschlandradio Kultur' =&gt; 8,...)

       <u>occurrences</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns a new list of frequencies and the corresponding values from LIST.

         my @o = occurrences ((1) x 3, (2) x 4, (3) x 2, (4) x 7, (5) x 2, (6) x 4);
         #  @o = (undef, undef, [3, 5], [1], [2, 6], undef, undef, [4]);

       <u>mode</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns the modal value of LIST. In scalar context, just the modal value is returned, in list context all
       probes occurring <u>modal</u> times are returned, too.

         my @m = mode ((1) x 3, (2) x 4, (3) x 2, (4) x 7, (5) x 2, (6) x 4, (7) x 3, (8) x 7);
         #  @m = (7, 4, 8) - bimodal LIST

       <u>slide</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       The function "slide" operates on pairs of list elements like:

         my @s = slide { "$a and $b" } (0..3);
         # @s = ("0 and 1", "1 and 2", "2 and 3")

       The  idea behind this function is a kind of magnifying glass that is moved along a list and calls "BLOCK"
       every time the next list item is reached.

   <b>Partitioning</b>
       <u>after</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns a list of the values of LIST after (and not including) the  point  where  BLOCK  returns  a  true
       value. Sets $_ for each element in LIST in turn.

         @x = after { $_ % 5 == 0 } (1..9);    # returns 6, 7, 8, 9

       <u>after_incl</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Same as "after" but also includes the element for which BLOCK is true.

       <u>before</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  a  list  of values of LIST up to (and not including) the point where BLOCK returns a true value.
       Sets $_ for each element in LIST in turn.

       <u>before_incl</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Same as "before" but also includes the element for which BLOCK is true.

       <u>part</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Partitions LIST based on the return value of BLOCK which denotes into which partition the  current  value
       is put.

       Returns a list of the partitions thusly created. Each partition created is a reference to an array.

         my $i = 0;
         my @part = part { $i++ % 2 } 1 .. 8;   # returns [1, 3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8]

       You can have a sparse list of partitions as well where non-set partitions will be undef:

         my @part = part { 2 } 1 .. 10;            # returns undef, undef, [ 1 .. 10 ]

       Be careful with negative values, though:

         my @part = part { -1 } 1 .. 10;
         __END__
         Modification of non-creatable array value attempted, subscript -1 ...

       Negative values are only ok when they refer to a partition previously created:

         my @idx  = ( 0, 1, -1 );
         my $i    = 0;
         my @part = part { $idx[$i++ % 3] } 1 .. 8; # [1, 4, 7], [2, 3, 5, 6, 8]

       <u>samples</u> <u>COUNT</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  a new list containing COUNT random samples from LIST. Is similar to "shuffle" in List::Util, but
       stops after COUNT.

         @r  = samples 10, 1..10; # same as shuffle
         @r2 = samples 5, 1..10; # gives 5 values from 1..10;

   <b>Iteration</b>
       <u>each_array</u> <u>ARRAY1</u> <u>ARRAY2</u> <u>...</u>

       Creates an array iterator to return the elements of the list of arrays ARRAY1, ARRAY2  throughout  ARRAYn
       in  turn.   That  is,  the first time it is called, it returns the first element of each array.  The next
       time, it returns the second elements.  And so on, until all elements are exhausted.

       This is useful for looping over more than one array at once:

         my $ea = each_array(@a, @b, @c);
         while ( my ($a, $b, $c) = $ea-&gt;() )   { .... }

       The iterator returns the empty list when it reached the end of all arrays.

       If the iterator is passed an argument of '"index"', then it returns the index of the last fetched set  of
       values, as a scalar.

       <u>each_arrayref</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Like each_array, but the arguments are references to arrays, not the plain arrays.

       <u>natatime</u> <u>EXPR,</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Creates  an array iterator, for looping over an array in chunks of $n items at a time.  (n at a time, get
       it?).  An example is probably a better explanation than I could give in words.

       Example:

         my @x = ('a' .. 'g');
         my $it = natatime 3, @x;
         while (my @vals = $it-&gt;())
         {
           print "@vals\n";
         }

       This prints

         a b c
         d e f
         g

       <u>slideatatime</u> <u>STEP,</u> <u>WINDOW,</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Creates an array iterator, for looping over an array in chunks of "$windows-size" items at a time.

       The idea behind this function is a kind of magnifying glass (finer controllable compared to "slide") that
       is moved along a list.

       Example:

         my @x = ('a' .. 'g');
         my $it = slideatatime 2, 3, @x;
         while (my @vals = $it-&gt;())
         {
           print "@vals\n";
         }

       This prints

         a b c
         c d e
         e f g
         g

       "last_result" is an alias for "lastres".

       <u>indexes</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Evaluates BLOCK for each element in LIST (assigned to $_) and returns a list  of  the  indices  of  those
       elements  for  which  BLOCK  returned a true value. This is just like "grep" only that it returns indices
       instead of values:

         @x = indexes { $_ % 2 == 0 } (1..10);   # returns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

         printf "item with index %i in list is 4", lastidx { $_ == 4 } @list;
         __END__
         item with index 4 in list is 4

       Returns "-1" if no such item could be found.

       "last_index" is an alias for "lastidx".

   <b>Sorting</b>
       <u>sort_by</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns the list of values sorted according to the  string  values  returned  by  the  KEYFUNC  block  or
       function.  A  typical  use of this may be to sort objects according to the string value of some accessor,
       such as

         sort_by { $_-&gt;name } @people

       The key function is called in scalar context, being passed each value in turn as both  $_  and  the  only
       argument  in the parameters, @_. The values are then sorted according to string comparisons on the values
       returned.  This is equivalent to

         sort { $a-&gt;name cmp $b-&gt;name } @people

       except that it guarantees the name accessor will be executed only once per value.  One  interesting  use-
       case is to sort strings which may have numbers embedded in them "naturally", rather than lexically.

         sort_by { s/(\d+)/sprintf "%09d", $1/eg; $_ } @strings

       This sorts strings by generating sort keys which zero-pad the embedded numbers to some level (9 digits in
       this case), helping to ensure the lexical sort puts them in the correct order.

       <u>nsort_by</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Similar to sort_by but compares its key values numerically.

       <u>qsort</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>ARRAY</u>

       This  sorts  the given array <b>in</b> <b>place</b> using the given compare code. Except for tiny compare code like "$a
       &lt;=&gt; $b", qsort is much faster than Perl's "sort" depending on the version.

       Compared 5.8 and 5.26:

         my @rl;
         for(my $i = 0; $i &lt; 1E6; ++$i) { push @rl, <a href="../man1E5/rand.1E5.html">rand</a>(1E5) }
         my $idx;

         sub ext_cmp { $_[0] &lt;=&gt; $_[1] }

         cmpthese( -60, {
             'qsort' =&gt; sub {
                 my @qrl = @rl;
                 qsort { ext_cmp($a, $b) } @qrl;
                 $idx = bsearchidx { ext_cmp($_, $rl[0]) } @qrl
             },
             'reverse qsort' =&gt; sub {
                 my @qrl = @rl;
                 qsort { ext_cmp($b, $a) } @qrl;
                 $idx = bsearchidx { ext_cmp($rl[0], $_) } @qrl

       Use it where external data sources might have to be compared (think of Unix::Statgrab "tables").

       "qsort" is available from List::MoreUtils::XS only. It's insane to maintain a wrapper around Perl's  sort
       nor having a pure Perl implementation. One could create a flip-book in same speed as PP runs a qsort.

   <b>Searching</b> <b>in</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>Lists</b>
       <u>bsearch</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Performs  a  binary  search  on  LIST which must be a sorted list of values. BLOCK must return a negative
       value if the current element (stored in $_) is smaller, a positive value if it is bigger and zero  if  it
       matches.

       Returns  a  boolean  value  in  scalar  context. In list context, it returns the element if it was found,
       otherwise the empty list.

       <u>bsearchidx</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>bsearch_index</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Performs a binary search on LIST which must be a sorted list of values.  BLOCK  must  return  a  negative
       value  if  the current element (stored in $_) is smaller, a positive value if it is bigger and zero if it
       matches.

       Returns the index of found element, otherwise "-1".

       "bsearch_index" is an alias for "bsearchidx".

       <u>lower_bound</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns the index of the first element in LIST which does not compare <u>less</u> <u>than</u> <u>val</u>. Technically it's the
       first element in LIST which does not return a value below zero when passed to BLOCK.

         @ids = (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 11, 13, 13, 13, 17);
         $lb = lower_bound { $_ &lt;=&gt; 2 } @ids; # returns 2
         $lb = lower_bound { $_ &lt;=&gt; 4 } @ids; # returns 10

       lower_bound has a complexity of O(log n).

       <u>upper_bound</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns the index of the first element in LIST which does not compare <u>greater</u> <u>than</u> <u>val</u>. Technically  it's
       the first element in LIST which does not return a value below or equal to zero when passed to BLOCK.

         @ids = (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 11, 13, 13, 13, 17);
         $lb = upper_bound { $_ &lt;=&gt; 2 } @ids; # returns 4
         $lb = upper_bound { $_ &lt;=&gt; 4 } @ids; # returns 14

       upper_bound has a complexity of O(log n).

       <u>equal_range</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns a pair of indices containing the lower_bound and the upper_bound.

   <b>Operations</b> <b>on</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>Lists</b>
       <u>binsert</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>ITEM</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>bsearch_insert</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>ITEM</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Performs  a  binary  search  on  LIST which must be a sorted list of values. BLOCK must return a negative
       value if the current element (stored in $_) is smaller, a positive value if it is bigger and zero  if  it
       matches.

       ITEM  is  inserted at the index where the ITEM should be placed (based on above search). That means, it's
       inserted before the next bigger element.

         @l = (2,3,5,7);
         binsert { $_ &lt;=&gt; 4 }  4, @l; # @l = (2,3,4,5,7)
         binsert { $_ &lt;=&gt; 6 } 42, @l; # @l = (2,3,4,42,7)

       You take care that the inserted element matches the compare result.

       <u>bremove</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>bsearch_remove</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Performs a binary search on LIST which must be a sorted list of values.  BLOCK  must  return  a  negative
       value  if  the current element (stored in $_) is smaller, a positive value if it is bigger and zero if it
       matches.

       The item at the found position is removed and returned.

         @l = (2,3,4,5,7);
         bremove { $_ &lt;=&gt; 4 }, @l; # @l = (2,3,5,7);

   <b>Counting</b> <b>and</b> <b>calculation</b>
       <u>true</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Counts the number of elements in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK is true.  Sets $_ for   each  item
       in LIST in turn:

         printf "%i item(s) are defined", true { defined($_) } @list;

       <u>false</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Counts  the  number of elements in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK is false.  Sets $_ for each item
       in LIST in turn:

         printf "%i item(s) are not defined", false { defined($_) } @list;

       <u>reduce_0</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Reduce LIST by calling BLOCK in scalar context for each element of LIST.  $a contains  the  progressional
       result  and is initialized with 0.  $b contains the current processed element of LIST and $_ contains the
       index of the element in $b.

       The idea behind reduce_0 is <b>summation</b> (addition of a sequence of numbers).

       <u>reduce_1</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Reduce LIST by calling BLOCK in scalar context for each element of LIST.  $a contains  the  progressional
       result  and is initialized with 1.  $b contains the current processed element of LIST and $_ contains the
       index of the element in $b.

       The idea behind reduce_1 is product of a sequence of numbers.

       <u>reduce_u</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Reduce LIST by calling BLOCK in scalar context for each element of LIST.  $a contains  the  progressional
       result and is uninitialized.  $b contains the current processed element of LIST and $_ contains the index
       of the element in $b.

       This  function  has  been  added  if  one  might need the extra of the index value but need an individual
       initialization.

       <b>Use</b> <b>with</b> <b>caution</b>: In most cases "reduce" in List::Util will do the job better.

       <u>minmax</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Calculates the minimum and maximum of LIST and returns a two element list with the  first  element  being
       the minimum and the second the maximum. Returns the empty list if LIST was empty.

       The "minmax" algorithm differs from a naive iteration over the list where each element is compared to two
       values  being the so far calculated min and max value in that it only requires 3n/2 - 2 comparisons. Thus
       it is the most efficient possible algorithm.

       However, the Perl implementation of it has some overhead simply due to the fact that there are more lines
       of Perl code involved. Therefore, LIST needs to be fairly big in order for "minmax" to win over  a  naive
       implementation. This limitation does not apply to the XS version.

       <u>minmaxstr</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Computes  the  minimum  and  maximum of LIST using string compare and returns a two element list with the
       first element being the minimum and the second the maximum. Returns the empty list if LIST was empty.

       The implementation is similar to "minmax".

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       When "LIST_MOREUTILS_PP" is set, the module will always use the pure-Perl implementation and not  the  XS
       one.  This  environment  variable  is  really  just  there  for  the test-suite to force testing the Perl
       implementation, and possibly for reporting of bugs. I don't see any reason to  use  it  in  a  production
       environment.

</pre><h4><b>MAINTENANCE</b></h4><pre>
       The  maintenance  goal  is  to  preserve the documented semantics of the API; bug fixes that bring actual
       behavior in line with semantics are allowed.  New API functions may be added over time.  If  a  backwards
       incompatible  change is unavoidable, we will attempt to provide support for the legacy API using the same
       export tag mechanism currently in place.

       This module attempts to use few non-core dependencies. Non-core configuration and testing modules will be
       bundled when reasonable; run-time dependencies will be added only if they deliver substantial benefit.

</pre><h4><b>CONTRIBUTING</b></h4><pre>
       While contributions are appreciated, a contribution should not cause more effort for the maintainer  than
       the      contribution      itself      saves      (see     Open     Source     Contribution     Etiquette
       &lt;<a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html">http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html</a>&gt;).

       To get more familiar where help could be needed - see List::MoreUtils::Contributing.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There is a problem with a bug in 5.6.x perls. It is a syntax error to write things like:

           my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } qw{ foo bar baz };

       It has to be written as either

           my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } 'foo', 'bar', 'baz';

       or

           my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } my @dummy = qw/foo bar baz/;

       Perl 5.5.x and Perl 5.8.x don't suffer from this limitation.

       If you have a functionality that you could imagine being in this module, please  drop  me  a  line.  This
       module's  policy  will  be  less  strict  than List::Util's when it comes to additions as it isn't a core
       module.

       When you report bugs, it would be nice if you could additionally give me the output of your program  with
       the  environment  variable "LIST_MOREUTILS_PP" set to a true value. That way I know where to look for the
       problem (in XS, pure-Perl or possibly both).

       Bugs  and  feature  requests  are  accepted  against  the latest version only. To get patches for earlier
       versions, you need to get an agreement with a developer of your choice - who may or not report the  issue
       and a suggested fix upstream (depends on the license you have chosen).

   <b>Business</b> <b>support</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b>
       Generally,  in  volunteered  projects, there is no right for support.  While every maintainer is happy to
       improve the provided software, spare time is limited.

       For those who have a use case which requires guaranteed support, one of the maintainers should  be  hired
       or  contracted.   For business support you can contact Jens via his CPAN email address rehsackATcpan.org.
       Please keep in mind that business support is neither available for free nor are you eligible  to  receive
       any support based on the license distributed with this package.

       Credits  go  to  a  number  of  people:  Steve Purkis for giving me namespace advice and James Keenan and
       Terrence Branno for their effort of keeping the CPAN tidier by making List::Utils obsolete.

       Brian McCauley suggested the inclusion of <b>apply()</b> and provided the pure-Perl implementation for it.

       Eric J. Roode asked me to add all functions from his module "List::MoreUtil" into this  one.  With  minor
       modifications, the pure-Perl implementations of those are by him.

       The  bunch  of  people who almost immediately pointed out the many problems with the glitchy 0.07 release
       (Slaven Rezic, Ron Savage, CPAN testers).

       A particularly nasty memory leak was spotted by Thomas A. Lowery.

       Lars Thegler made me aware of problems with older Perl versions.

       Anno Siegel de-orphaned <b>each_arrayref()</b>.

       David Filmer made me aware of a problem in each_arrayref that could ultimately lead to a segfault.

       Ricardo Signes suggested the inclusion of <b>part()</b> and provided the Perl-implementation.

       Robin Huston kindly fixed a bug in perl's MULTICALL API to make the XS-implementation of <b>part()</b> work.

       Credits goes to all people contributing feedback during the v0.400 development releases.

       Special thanks goes to David Golden who spent a lot of effort to develop  a  design  to  support  current
       state  of CPAN as well as ancient software somewhere in the dark. He also contributed a lot of patches to
       refactor the API frontend to welcome any user of List::MoreUtils - from ancient  past  to  recently  last
       used.

       Toby  Inkster  provided a lot of useful feedback for sane importer code and was a nice sounding board for
       API discussions.

       Peter Rabbitson provided a sane git repository setup containing entire package history.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       A pile of requests from other people is still pending further processing in my mailbox. This includes:

       •   delete_index

       •   random_item

       •   random_item_delete_index

       •   list_diff_hash

       •   list_diff_inboth

       •   list_diff_infirst

       •   list_diff_insecond

           These were all suggested by Dan Muey.

       •   listify

           Always return a flat list when either a  simple  scalar  value  was  passed  or  an  array-reference.
           Suggested by Mark Summersault.
