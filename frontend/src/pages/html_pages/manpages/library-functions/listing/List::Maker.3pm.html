           @list = &lt; ^@array &gt;;                  # (0..$#array)

           @words = &lt; a list of words &gt;;         # ('a', 'list', 'of', 'words')
           @words = &lt; 'a list' "of words" &gt;;     # ('a list', 'of words')

           use List::Maker 'listify';
           @list = listify '1..10';              # (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

           use List::Maker 'make_list';
           @list = make_list '10..1';            # (10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)

           use List::Maker 'ql';
           @list = ql'1..10 x 2';                # (1,3,5,7,9)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The List::Maker module hijacks Perl's built-in file globbing syntax ("&lt; *.pl &gt;" and "glob '*.pl'") and
       retargets it at list creation.

       The rationale is simple: most people rarely if ever glob a set of files, but they have to create lists in
       almost every program they write. So the list construction syntax should be easier than the filename
       expansion syntax.

       Alternatively, you can load the module with an explicit name, and it creates a subroutine of that name
       that builds the same kinds of lists for you (leaving the globbing mechanism unaltered).

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       Within any file in which the module has been explicitly loaded:

           use List::Maker;

       angle brackets no longer expand a shell pattern into a list of files.  Instead, they expand a list
       specification into a list of values.

       Under Perl 5.10 and later the module is also lexically scoped in its effects. That is, under Perls that
       support it, the change in the behaviour of angle brackets is confined to the specific lexical scope into
       which the module was imported.

       Under Perl 5.8 and earlier, loading the module changes the effect of "&lt;...&gt;" and "glob()" for the
       remainder of the current package in the current file.

       This means:

           # Code                  Under 5.8 or earlier    Under 5.10 or later
           ====================    ====================    ===================
           @list = &lt;1..10&gt;;        normal glob()           normal glob()
           {
               use List::Maker;    installs in file        installs in block
               @list = &lt;1..10&gt;;    generates list          generates list
           }
           @list = &lt;1..10&gt;;        generates list          normal glob()

   <b>Numeric</b> <b>lists</b>
       Numeric list specifications may take any of the following forms:

           Type           Syntax                  For example     Produces
           ==========     ===================     ===========     ===========
           Count up       &lt;MIN..MAX&gt;              &lt;1..5&gt;          (1,2,3,4,5)
           Count down     &lt;MAX..MIN&gt;              &lt;5..1&gt;          (5,4,3,2,1)
           Count to       &lt; ^LIMIT &gt;              &lt; ^5 &gt;          (0,1,2,3,4)
           Count by       &lt;START..END x STEP&gt;     &lt;1..10 x 3&gt;     (1,4,7,10)
           Count via      &lt;START, NEXT,..END&gt;     &lt;1, 3,..10&gt;     (1,3,5,7,9)

       The numbers don't have to be integers either:

           @scores = &lt;0.5..4.5&gt;;      # same as: (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5)

           @steps = &lt;1..0 x -0.2&gt;;    # same as: (1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0)

   <b>Filtered</b> <b>numeric</b> <b>lists</b>
       Any of the various styles of numeric list may also have a filter applied to it, by appending a colon,
       followed by a boolean expression:

           @odds   = &lt;1..100 : \$_ % 2 != 0 &gt;;

           @primes = &lt;3,5..99&gt; : is_prime(\$_) &gt;;

           @available = &lt; ^$max : !allocated{\$_} &gt;

           @ends_in_7 = &lt;1..1000 : /7$/ &gt;

       The boolean expression is tested against each element of the list, and only those for which it is true
       are retained. During these tests each element is aliased to $_. However, since angle brackets
       interpolate, it's necessary to escape any explicit reference to $_ within the filtering expression, as in
       the first three examples above.

       That often proves to be annoying, so the module also allows the candidate value to be referred to using
       any single uppercase letter (which is replaced with "\$_" when the filter is applied. So the previous
       examples could also be written:

           @odds   = &lt;1..100 : N % 2 != 0 &gt;;

           @primes = &lt;3,5..99&gt; : is_prime(N) &gt;;

           @available = &lt; ^$max : !allocated{N} &gt;

       or (since the specific letter is irrelevant):

           @odds   = &lt;1..100 : X % 2 != 0 &gt;;

           @primes = &lt;3,5..99&gt; : is_prime(I) &gt;;

           @available = &lt; ^$max : !allocated{T} &gt;

   <b>Randomly</b> <b>selecting</b> <b>from</b> <b>lists</b>
       In addition to (or instead of) specifying a filter on a list, you can also select a specific number of
       the list's items at random, by appending ":pick" <u>N</u> to the list specification.

       For example:

           $N_random_percentages = &lt;0..100 : pick $N &gt;;

           @any_three_primes = &lt;3,5..99&gt; : is_prime(I) : pick 3&gt;;

           $one_available = &lt; ^$max : !allocated{T} :pick&gt;

       The requested number of elements are picked at random, and without replacement. If the number of elements
       to be picked is omitted, a single element is randomly picked.

       You can also pick <u>with</u> replacement (which is equivalent to rolling some number of M-sided dice, with one
       list element on each face), by using ":roll" instead of ":pick":

           $N_nonunique_random_percentages = &lt;0..100 : roll $N &gt;;

           @three_nonunique_primes = &lt;3,5..99&gt; : is_prime(I) : roll 3&gt;;

           $one_available = &lt; ^$max : !allocated{T} :roll&gt;

       If the number of elements to be rolled is omitted, a single element is randomly rolled (which is exactly
       the same as randomly picking it).

       Note that, because each requested "roll" is independent, it's entirely possible for one or more values to
       be selected repeatedly.

   <b>String</b> <b>lists</b>
       Any list specification that doesn't conform to one of the four pattern described above is taken to be a
       list of whitespace-separated strings, like a "qw{...}" list:

           @words = &lt;Eat at Joe's&gt;;     # same as: ( 'Eat', 'at', 'Joe\'s' )

       However, unlike a "qw{...}", these string lists interpolate (before listification):

           $whose = q{Joe's};

           @words = &lt;Eat at $whose&gt;;    # same as: ( 'Eat', 'at', 'Joe\'s' )

       More interestingly, the words in these lists can be quoted to change the default whitespace separation.
       For example:

           @names = &lt;Tom Dick "Harry Potter"&gt;;
                               # same as: ( 'Tom', 'Dick', 'Harry Potter' )

       Single quotes may be also used, but this may be misleading, since the overall list still interpolates in
       that case:

           @names = &lt;Tom Dick '$Harry{Potter}'&gt;;
                               # same as: ( 'Tom', 'Dick', "$Harry{Potter}" )

       In a scalar context, any string list is converted to the standard English representation:

           $names = &lt;Tom&gt;;                       # 'Tom'
           $names = &lt;Tom Dick&gt;;                  # 'Tom and Dick'
           $names = &lt;Tom Dick 'Harry Potter'&gt;;   # 'Tom, Dick, and Harry Potter'

   <b>Perl</b> <b>6</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>list</b> <b>operator</b>
       List::Maker also understands the Perl 6 "xx" listification operator:

           @affirmations = &lt;'aye' xx 5&gt;;         # ('aye','aye','aye','aye','aye')

   <b>Random</b> <b>number</b> <b>generation</b>
       The module understands two syntaxes for generating random numbers. It can generate a random number within
       a range:

           $random = &lt; 2r5.5 &gt;;     # 2 &lt;= Random number &lt; 5.5

       It can also generate an "NdS" dice roll (i.e. the sum of rolling N dice, each with S sides):

           $roll = &lt; 3d12 &gt;;        # Sum of three 12-sided dice

       The dice notation cares nothing for the laws of physics or rationality and so it will even allow you to
       specify a non-integer number of "fractal dice", each with an non-integer numbers of sides:

           $roll = &lt; 3.7d12.3 &gt;;    # Sum of three-point-seven 12.3-sided dice

       In a list context, the dice notation returns the results of each of the individual die rolls (including
       the partial result of a "fractal" roll)

           @rolls = &lt; 3d12 &gt;;       # (6, 5, 12)
           @rolls = &lt; 3.7d12.3 &gt;;   # (6.1256, 5.9876, 12.0012, 0.3768)

       The values returned in list context will always add up to the value that would have been returned in a
       scalar context.

   <b>User-defined</b> <b>syntax</b> <b>via</b> <b>"add_handler"</b>
       You can add new syntax variations to the "&lt;...&gt;" format using the "add_handler()" function:

           add_handler($pattern =&gt; $sub_ref, $pattern =&gt; $sub_ref...);

       Each pattern is added to the list of syntax checkers and, if it matches, the corresponding subroutine is
       called to furnish the result of the "&lt;...&gt;". User-defined handlers are tested in the same order that they
       are defined, but <u>before</u> the standard built-in formats described above.

</pre><h4><b>ALTERNATE</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       If an argument is passed to the "use List::Maker" statement, then that argument is used as the name of a
       subroutine to be installed in the current package. That subroutine then expects a single argument, which
       may be used to generate any of the lists described above.

       In other words, passing an argument to "use List::Maker" creates an explicit list-making subroutine,
       rather than hijacking the built-in "&lt;..&gt;" and "glob()".

       For example:

           use List::Maker 'range';

           for (range '1..100 x 5') {
               print "$_: $result{$_}\n";
           }

           use List::Maker 'roll';

           if (roll '3d12' &gt; 20) {
               print "The $creature hits you\n";
           }

           use List::Maker 'conjoin';

           print scalar conjoin @names;

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       "Sequence &lt;%s, %s, %s...&gt; will never reach %s"
           The  specified  numeric  list  didn't make sense. Typically, because you specified an increasing list
           with a negative step size (or vice versa).

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       List::Maker requires no configuration files or environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       Using this module normally prevents you from using the built-in behaviours of "&lt;...&gt;" or "glob()" in  any
       files  that  directly "use" the module (though files that don't load the module are unaffected). In files
       that use the module, you would need to use the "File::Glob" module directly:

           use File::Glob;

           my @files = bsd_glob("*.pl");

       Alternatively, export the list maker by name (see "ALTERNATE INTERFACE").

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The lists generated are not lazy. So this:

           for (&lt;1..10000000&gt;) {
               ...
           }

       will be vastly slower than:

           for (1..10000000) {
               ...
           }
