</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mail::RBL - Perl extension to access RBL-style host verification services

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Mail::RBL;

         my $list = new Mail::RBL('list.org');

         # You can also specify a resolver to use with Net::DNS::Resolver

         my $list = new Mail::RBL('list.org', $res);

         if ($list-&gt;check($host)) {
             print "$host is in the list";
         }

         my ($ip_result, $optional_info_txt) = $list-&gt;check($host);
         # $optional_info_txt will be undef if the list does not provide TXT
         # RRs along with the A RRs.

         print "The list says ", ($list-&gt;check($host))[1], " in its TXT RR\n";

         my ($ip_result, $optional_info_txt) = $list-&gt;check_rhsbl($hostname);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module eases the task of checking if a given host is in the list. The methods available are
       described below:

       "-&gt;new(suffix, resolver)"
           Creates  a  list  handle. The "suffix" parameter is mandatory and specifies which suffix to append to
           the queries. If left unspecified, defaults to "bl.spamcop.net".

           An optional DNS resolver can be specified. An object of the <b>Net::DNS::<a href="../man3/Resolver.3.html">Resolver</a></b>(3) class is expected.

       "-&gt;check($host)"
           $host can be either a hostname or an IP address. In the case of an IP  Address.  In  the  case  of  a
           hostname,  all  the  IP  addresses  will  be  looked  up  and checked against the list. If <b>any</b> of the
           addresses is in the list, the host will be considered in the list as a whole.

           Returns either a "NetAddr::IP" object as returned by the RBL itself, or "undef" in case the RBL  does
           not  supply an answer. This is important because many lists inject some semantics on the DNS response
           value, which now can be recovered easily with the program that uses this module.

           In array context,  any IP addresses are returned,  followed by any TXT RR (or undef if none).  If  no
           match  is  found,  an  empty list is returned instead. In  scalar context, only the  first IP address
           (or undef) is returned.

       "-&gt;check_rhsbl($host)"
           Analogous to "-&gt;check()", but  queries RHSBLs instead of IP-based lists.   This   is    useful    for
           using  lists   such   as  some   of <b><a href="http://www.rfc-ignorant.org/">http://www.rfc-ignorant.org/</a></b>.

           Results and return values are the same as "-&gt;check()".

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
         $Log: RBL.pm,v $
         Revision 1.10  2007/04/25 04:22:04  lem
         Finished adding support for the custom resolver code - Implementation
         was incomplete

         Revision 1.9  2006/12/08 00:01:14  lem
         Get version straight from the CVS revision.

         Revision 1.8  2006/12/07 23:58:07  lem
         Allow the user to provide a Net::DNS::Resolver object to perform DNS
         resolution - This allows finer control over how the queries are
         performed. Suggested by Eric Langheinrich.

       1.00
           Original version.

       1.01
           Minor  bug  fixes.  Cleaned  up  MS-DOS line endings. Changed test cases (more and better tests). Now
           requires Test::More. More useful return values. Improved docs. First  crypto-signed  distribution  of
           this module.
