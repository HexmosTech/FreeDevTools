</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::CodeLayout::RequireTrailingCommas - Put a comma at the end of every multi-line list
       declaration, including the last one.

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is part of the core Perl::Critic distribution.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Conway suggests that all elements in a multi-line list should be separated by commas, including the last
       element.  This makes it a little easier to re-order the list by cutting and pasting.

           my @list = ($foo,
                       $bar,
                       $baz);  #not ok

           my @list = ($foo,
                       $bar,
                       $baz,); #ok

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is not configurable except for the standard options.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       In the PPI parlance, a "list" is almost anything with parentheses.  I've tried to make this Policy smart
       by targeting only "lists" that have at least one element and are being assigned to something.  However,
       there may be some edge cases that I haven't covered.  If you find one, send me a note.
