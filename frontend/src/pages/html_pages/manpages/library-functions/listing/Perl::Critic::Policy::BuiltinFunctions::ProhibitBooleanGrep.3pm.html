</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitBooleanGrep - Use "any" from "List::Util",
       "List::SomeUtils", or "List::MoreUtils" instead of "grep" in boolean context.

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is part of the core Perl::Critic distribution.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Using "grep" in boolean context is a common idiom for checking if any elements in a list match a
       condition.  This works because boolean context is a subset of scalar context, and grep returns the number
       of matches in scalar context.  A non-zero number of matches means a match.

       But consider the case of a long array where the first element is a match.  Boolean "grep" still checks
       all of the rest of the elements needlessly.  Instead, a better solution is to use the "any" function from
       either List::Util, List::SomeUtils, or List::MoreUtils. The "any" function will return as soon as a
       successful match is found, rather than processing the entire list.  This saves time.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is not configurable except for the standard options.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The algorithm for detecting boolean context takes a LOT of shortcuts.  There are lots of known false
       negatives.  But, I was conservative in writing this, so I hope there are no false positives.
