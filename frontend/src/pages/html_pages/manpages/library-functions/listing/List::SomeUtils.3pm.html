</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       List::SomeUtils - Provide the stuff missing in List::Util

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.59

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # import specific functions
           use List::SomeUtils qw( any uniq );

           if ( any {/foo/} uniq @has_duplicates ) {

               # do stuff
           }

           # import everything
           use List::SomeUtils ':all';

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>List::SomeUtils</b> provides some trivial but commonly needed functionality on lists which is not going to go
       into List::Util.

       All of the below functions are implementable in only a couple of lines of Perl code. Using the functions
       from this module however should give slightly better performance as everything is implemented in C. The
       pure-Perl implementation of these functions only serves as a fallback in case the C portions of this
       module couldn't be compiled on this machine.

</pre><h4><b>WHY</b> <b>DOES</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>MODULE</b> <b>EXIST?</b></h4><pre>
       You might wonder why this module exists when we already have List::MoreUtils. In fact, this module is
       (nearly) the same code as is found in LMU with no significant changes. However, the LMU distribution
       depends on several modules for configuration (to run the Makefile.PL) that some folks in the Perl
       community don't think are appropriate for a module high upstream in the CPAN river.

       I (Dave Rolsky) don't have a strong opinion on this, but I <u>do</u> like the functions provided by LMU, and I'm
       tired of getting patches and PRs to remove LMU from my code.

       This distribution exists to let me use the functionality I like without having to get into tiring
       arguments about issues I don't really care about.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Default</b> <b>behavior</b>
       Nothing by default. To import all of this module's symbols use the ":all" tag.  Otherwise functions can
       be imported by name as usual:

           use List::SomeUtils ':all';

           use List::SomeUtils qw{ any firstidx };

       Because historical changes to the API might make upgrading List::SomeUtils difficult for some projects,
       the legacy API is available via special import tags.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Junctions</b>
       <u>Treatment</u> <u>of</u> <u>an</u> <u>empty</u> <u>list</u>

       There are two schools of thought for how to evaluate a junction on an empty list:

       •   Reduction to an identity (boolean)

       •   Result is undefined (three-valued)

       In  the  first case, the result of the junction applied to the empty list is determined by a mathematical
       reduction to an identity depending on whether the underlying comparison is "or" or "and".  Conceptually:

                           "any are true"      "all are true"
                           --------------      --------------
           2 elements:     A || B || 0         A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; 1
           1 element:      A || 0              A &amp;&amp; 1
           0 elements:     0                   1

       In the second case, three-value logic is desired, in which a junction applied to an  empty  list  returns
       "undef" rather than true or false

       Junctions with a "_u" suffix implement three-valued logic.  Those without are boolean.

       <u>all</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>all_u</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  a  true value if all items in LIST meet the criterion given through BLOCK. Sets $_ for each item
       in LIST in turn:

         print "All values are non-negative"
           if all { $_ &gt;= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);

       For an empty LIST, "all" returns true (i.e. no values failed the condition) and "all_u" returns "undef".

       Thus, "all_u(@list)" is equivalent to "@list ? all(@list) : undef".

       <b>Note</b>: because Perl treats "undef" as false, you must check the return value of "all_u" with "defined"  or
       you will get the opposite result of what you expect.

       <u>any</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>any_u</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  a  true value if any item in LIST meets the criterion given through BLOCK. Sets $_ for each item
       in LIST in turn:

         print "At least one non-negative value"
           if any { $_ &gt;= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);

       For an empty LIST, "any" returns false and "any_u" returns "undef".

       Thus, "any_u(@list)" is equivalent to "@list ? any(@list) : undef".

       <u>none</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>none_u</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Logically the negation of "any". Returns a true value if no  item  in  LIST  meets  the  criterion  given
       through BLOCK. Sets $_ for each item in LIST in turn:

         print "No non-negative values"
           if none { $_ &gt;= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);

       For  an  empty  LIST,  "none"  returns  true  (i.e.  no values failed the condition) and "none_u" returns
       "undef".

       Thus, "none_u(@list)" is equivalent to "@list ? none(@list) : undef".

       <b>Note</b>: because Perl treats "undef" as false, you must check the return value of "none_u" with "defined" or
       you will get the opposite result of what you expect.

       <u>notall</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>notall_u</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Logically the negation of "all". Returns a true value if not all items in LIST meet the  criterion  given
       through BLOCK. Sets $_ for each item in LIST in turn:

         print "Not all values are non-negative"
           if notall { $_ &gt;= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);

       For an empty LIST, "notall" returns false and "notall_u" returns "undef".

       Thus, "notall_u(@list)" is equivalent to "@list ? notall(@list) : undef".

       <u>one</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>one_u</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  a  true value if precisely one item in LIST meets the criterion given through BLOCK. Sets $_ for
       each item in LIST in turn:

           print "Precisely one value defined"
               if one { defined($_) } @list;

       Returns false otherwise.

       For an empty LIST, "one" returns false and "one_u" returns "undef".

       The expression "one BLOCK LIST" is almost equivalent to "1 == true BLOCK LIST", except for short-cutting.
       Evaluation of BLOCK will immediately stop at the second true value.

   <b>Transformation</b>
       <u>apply</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Makes a copy of the list and then passes each element  <u>from</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>copy</u>  to  the  BLOCK.  Any  changes  or
       assignments  to  $_  in  the  BLOCK  will  only  affect the elements of the new list. However, if $_ is a
       reference then changes to the referenced value will be seen in both the original and new list.

       This function is similar to "map" but will not modify the elements of the input list:

         my @list = (1 .. 4);
         my @mult = apply { $_ *= 2 } @list;
         print "\@list = @list\n";
         print "\@mult = @mult\n";
         __END__
         @list = 1 2 3 4
         @mult = 2 4 6 8

       Think of it as syntactic sugar for

         for (my @mult = @list) { $_ *= 2 }

       Note that you must alter $_ directly inside BLOCK in order for changes to make effect. New value returned
       from the BLOCK are ignored:

         # @new is identical to @list.
         my @new = apply { $_ * 2 } @list;

         # @new is different from @list
         my @new = apply { $_ =* 2 } @list;

       <u>insert_after</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>VALUE</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Inserts VALUE after the first item in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK is true.  Sets  $_  for  each
       item in LIST in turn.

         my @list = qw/This is a list/;
         insert_after { $_ eq "a" } "longer" =&gt; @list;
         print "@list";
         __END__
         This is a longer list

       <u>insert_after_string</u> <u>STRING</u> <u>VALUE</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Inserts VALUE after the first item in LIST which is equal to STRING.

         my @list = qw/This is a list/;
         insert_after_string "a", "longer" =&gt; @list;
         print "@list";
         __END__
         This is a longer list

       <u>pairwise</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>ARRAY1</u> <u>ARRAY2</u>

       Evaluates  BLOCK  for  each  pair  of  elements in ARRAY1 and ARRAY2 and returns a new list consisting of
       BLOCK's return values. The two elements are set to $a and $b.  Note that those two  are  aliases  to  the
       original value so changing them will modify the input arrays.

         @a = (1 .. 5);
         @b = (11 .. 15);
         @x = pairwise { $a + $b } @a, @b;     # returns 12, 14, 16, 18, 20

         # mesh with pairwise
         @a = qw/a b c/;
         @b = qw/1 2 3/;
         @x = pairwise { ($a, $b) } @a, @b;    # returns a, 1, b, 2, c, 3

       <u>mesh</u> <u>ARRAY1</u> <u>ARRAY2</u> <u>[</u> <u>ARRAY3</u> <u>...</u> <u>]</u>

       <u>zip</u> <u>ARRAY1</u> <u>ARRAY2</u> <u>[</u> <u>ARRAY3</u> <u>...</u> <u>]</u>

       Returns  a  list  consisting  of  the first elements of each array, then the second, then the third, etc,
       until all arrays are exhausted.

       Examples:

         @x = qw/a b c d/;
         @y = qw/1 2 3 4/;
         @z = mesh @x, @y;         # returns a, 1, b, 2, c, 3, d, 4

         @a = ('x');
         @b = ('1', '2');
         @c = qw/zip zap zot/;
         @d = mesh @a, @b, @c;   # x, 1, zip, undef, 2, zap, undef, undef, zot

       "zip" is an alias for "mesh".

       <u>uniq</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>distinct</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns a new list by stripping duplicate values in LIST by comparing the values  as  hash  keys,  except
       that  undef  is considered separate from ''. The order of elements in the returned list is the same as in
       LIST. In scalar context, returns the number of unique elements in LIST.

         my @x = uniq 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 3, 4; # returns 1 2 3 5 4
         my $x = uniq 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 3, 4; # returns 5
         # returns "Mike", "Michael", "Richard", "Rick"
         my @n = distinct "Mike", "Michael", "Richard", "Rick", "Michael", "Rick"
         # returns '', undef, 'S1', A5'
         my @s = distinct '', undef, 'S1', 'A5'
         # returns '', undef, 'S1', A5'
         my @w = uniq undef, '', 'S1', 'A5'

       "distinct" is an alias for "uniq".

       <b>RT#49800</b> can be used to give feedback about this behavior.

       <u>singleton</u>

       Returns a new list by stripping values in LIST occurring more than once by comparing the values  as  hash
       keys,  except  that  undef is considered separate from ''.  The order of elements in the returned list is
       the same as in LIST. In scalar context, returns the number of elements occurring only once in LIST.

         my @x = singleton 1,1,2,2,3,4,5 # returns 3 4 5

   <b>Partitioning</b>
       <u>after</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns a list of the values of LIST after (and not including) the  point  where  BLOCK  returns  a  true
       value. Sets $_ for each element in LIST in turn.

         @x = after { $_ % 5 == 0 } (1..9);    # returns 6, 7, 8, 9

       <u>after_incl</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Same as "after" but also includes the element for which BLOCK is true.

       <u>before</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  a  list  of values of LIST up to (and not including) the point where BLOCK returns a true value.
       Sets $_ for each element in LIST in turn.

       <u>before_incl</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Same as "before" but also includes the element for which BLOCK is true.

       <u>part</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Partitions LIST based on the return value of BLOCK which denotes into which partition the  current  value
       is put.

       Returns a list of the partitions thusly created. Each partition created is a reference to an array.

         my $i = 0;
         my @part = part { $i++ % 2 } 1 .. 8;   # returns [1, 3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8]

       You can have a sparse list of partitions as well where non-set partitions will be undef:

         my @part = part { 2 } 1 .. 10;            # returns undef, undef, [ 1 .. 10 ]

       Be careful with negative values, though:

         my @part = part { -1 } 1 .. 10;
         __END__
         Modification of non-creatable array value attempted, subscript -1 ...

       Negative values are only ok when they refer to a partition previously created:

         my @idx  = ( 0, 1, -1 );
         my $i    = 0;
         my @part = part { $idx[$i++ % 3] } 1 .. 8; # [1, 4, 7], [2, 3, 5, 6, 8]

   <b>Iteration</b>
       <u>each_array</u> <u>ARRAY1</u> <u>ARRAY2</u> <u>...</u>

       Creates  an  array iterator to return the elements of the list of arrays ARRAY1, ARRAY2 throughout ARRAYn
       in turn.  That is, the first time it is called, it returns the first element of  each  array.   The  next
       time, it returns the second elements.  And so on, until all elements are exhausted.

       This is useful for looping over more than one array at once:

         my $ea = each_array(@a, @b, @c);
         while ( my ($a, $b, $c) = $ea-&gt;() )   { .... }

       The iterator returns the empty list when it reached the end of all arrays.

       If  the iterator is passed an argument of '"index"', then it returns the index of the last fetched set of
       values, as a scalar.

       <u>each_arrayref</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Like each_array, but the arguments are references to arrays, not the plain arrays.

       <u>natatime</u> <u>EXPR,</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Creates an array iterator, for looping over an array in chunks of $n items at a time.  (n at a time,  get
       it?).  An example is probably a better explanation than I could give in words.

       Example:

         my @x = ('a' .. 'g');
         my $it = natatime 3, @x;
         while (my @vals = $it-&gt;())
         {
           print "@vals\n";
         }

       This prints

         a b c
         d e f
         g

   <b>Searching</b>
       <u>bsearch</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Performs  a  binary  search  on  LIST which must be a sorted list of values. BLOCK must return a negative
       value if the current element (stored in $_) is smaller, a positive value if it is bigger and zero  if  it
       matches.

       Returns  a  boolean  value  in  scalar  context. In list context, it returns the element if it was found,
       otherwise the empty list.

       <u>bsearchidx</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>bsearch_index</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Performs a binary search on LIST which must be a sorted list of values.  BLOCK  must  return  a  negative
       value  if  the current element (stored in $_) is smaller, a positive value if it is bigger and zero if it
       matches.

       Returns the index of found element, otherwise "-1".

       "bsearch_index" is an alias for "bsearchidx".

       <u>firstval</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>first_value</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns the first element in LIST for which BLOCK evaluates to true. Each element of LIST is set to $_ in
       turn. Returns "undef" if no such element has been found.

       "first_value" is an alias for "firstval".

       <u>onlyval</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>only_value</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns the only element in LIST for which BLOCK evaluates to true. Sets $_ for  each  item  in  LIST  in
       turn. Returns "undef" if no such element has been found.

       "only_value" is an alias for "onlyval".

       <u>lastval</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>last_value</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  the  last  value in LIST for which BLOCK evaluates to true. Each element of LIST is set to $_ in
       turn. Returns "undef" if no such element has been found.

       "last_value" is an alias for "lastval".

       <u>firstres</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>first_result</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns the result of BLOCK for the first element in LIST for which BLOCK evaluates to true. Each element
       of LIST is set to $_ in turn. Returns "undef" if no such element has been found.

       "first_result" is an alias for "firstres".

       <u>onlyres</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>only_result</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns the result of BLOCK for the first element in LIST for which BLOCK evaluates to true. Sets $_  for
       each item in LIST in turn. Returns "undef" if no such element has been found.

       "only_result" is an alias for "onlyres".

       <u>lastres</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>last_result</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  the result of BLOCK for the last element in LIST for which BLOCK evaluates to true. Each element
       of LIST is set to $_ in turn. Returns "undef" if no such element has been found.

       "last_result" is an alias for "lastres".

       <u>indexes</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Evaluates BLOCK for each element in LIST (assigned to $_) and returns a list  of  the  indices  of  those
       elements  for  which  BLOCK  returned a true value. This is just like "grep" only that it returns indices
       instead of values:

         @x = indexes { $_ % 2 == 0 } (1..10);   # returns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

       <u>firstidx</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>first_index</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns the index of the first element in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK is true. Sets $_ for each
       item in LIST in turn:

         my @list = (1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 6);
         printf "item with index %i in list is 4", firstidx { $_ == 4 } @list;
         __END__
         item with index 1 in list is 4

       Returns "-1" if no such item could be found.

       "first_index" is an alias for "firstidx".

       <u>onlyidx</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

           printf "unique index of item 2 in list is %i", onlyidx { $_ == 2 } @list;
           __END__
           unique index of item 2 in list is 4

       Returns "-1" if either no such item or more than one of these has been found.

       "only_index" is an alias for "onlyidx".

       <u>lastidx</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>last_index</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  the index of the last element in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK is true. Sets $_ for each

         printf "item with index %i in list is 4", lastidx { $_ == 4 } @list;
         __END__
         item with index 4 in list is 4

       Returns "-1" if no such item could be found.

       "last_index" is an alias for "lastidx".

   <b>Sorting</b>
       <u>sort_by</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns the list of values sorted according to the  string  values  returned  by  the  KEYFUNC  block  or
       function.  A  typical  use of this may be to sort objects according to the string value of some accessor,
       such as

         sort_by { $_-&gt;name } @people

       The key function is called in scalar context, being passed each value in turn as both  $_  and  the  only
       argument  in the parameters, @_. The values are then sorted according to string comparisons on the values
       returned. This is equivalent to

         sort { $a-&gt;name cmp $b-&gt;name } @people

       except that it guarantees the name accessor will be executed only once per value.  One  interesting  use-
       case is to sort strings which may have numbers embedded in them "naturally", rather than lexically.

         sort_by { s/(\d+)/sprintf "%09d", $1/eg; $_ } @strings

       This sorts strings by generating sort keys which zero-pad the embedded numbers to some level (9 digits in
       this case), helping to ensure the lexical sort puts them in the correct order.

       <u>nsort_by</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Similar to sort_by but compares its key values numerically.

   <b>Counting</b> <b>and</b> <b>calculation</b>
       <u>true</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Counts  the  number of elements in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK is true.  Sets $_ for  each item
       in LIST in turn:

         printf "%i item(s) are defined", true { defined($_) } @list;

       <u>false</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Counts the number of elements in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK is false. Sets $_ for each item in
       LIST in turn:

         printf "%i item(s) are not defined", false { defined($_) } @list;

       <u>minmax</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Calculates the minimum and maximum of LIST and returns a two element list with the  first  element  being
       the minimum and the second the maximum. Returns the empty list if LIST was empty.

       The "minmax" algorithm differs from a naive iteration over the list where each element is compared to two
       values  being the so far calculated min and max value in that it only requires 3n/2 - 2 comparisons. Thus
       it is the most efficient possible algorithm.

       However, the Perl implementation of it has some overhead simply due to the fact that there are more lines
       of Perl code involved. Therefore, LIST needs to be fairly big in order for "minmax" to win over  a  naive
       implementation. This limitation does not apply to the XS version.

       <u>mode</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Calculates  the  most  common  items  in the list and returns them as a list. This is effectively done by
       string comparisons, so references will be stringified.  If they implement string overloading,  this  will
       be used.

       If  more than one item appears the same number of times in the list, all such items will be returned. For
       example, the mode of a unique list is the list itself.

       This function returns a list in list context. In scalar context it returns a count indicating the  number
       of modes in the list.

</pre><h4><b>MAINTENANCE</b></h4><pre>
       The  maintenance  goal  is  to  preserve the documented semantics of the API; bug fixes that bring actual
       behavior in line with semantics are allowed. New API functions may be added over time.   If  a  backwards
       incompatible  change is unavoidable, we will attempt to provide support for the legacy API using the same
       export tag mechanism currently in place.

       This module attempts to use few non-core dependencies. Non-core configuration and testing modules will be
       bundled when reasonable; run-time dependencies will be added only if they deliver substantial benefit.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       There is a problem with a bug in 5.6.x perls. It is a syntax error to write things like:

           my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } qw{ foo bar baz };

       It has to be written as either

           my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } 'foo', 'bar', 'baz';

       or

           my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } my @dummy = qw/foo bar baz/;

       Perl 5.5.x and Perl 5.8.x don't suffer from this limitation.

       If you have a functionality that you could imagine being in this module, please  drop  me  a  line.  This
       module's  policy  will  be  less  strict  than List::Util's when it comes to additions as it isn't a core
       module.

       When you report bugs, it would be nice if you could additionally give me the output of your program  with
       the  environment  variable "LIST_MOREUTILS_PP" set to a true value. That way I know where to look for the
       problem (in XS, pure-Perl or possibly both).

</pre><h4><b>THANKS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Tassilo</b> <b>von</b> <b>Parseval</b>
       Credits go to a number of people: Steve Purkis for giving  me  namespace  advice  and  James  Keenan  and
       Terrence Branno for their effort of keeping the CPAN tidier by making List::Util obsolete.

       Brian McCauley suggested the inclusion of <b>apply()</b> and provided the pure-Perl implementation for it.

       Eric  J.  Roode  asked me to add all functions from his module "List::SomeUtil" into this one. With minor
       modifications, the pure-Perl implementations of those are by him.

       The bunch of people who almost immediately pointed out the many problems with the  glitchy  0.07  release
       (Slaven Rezic, Ron Savage, CPAN testers).

       A particularly nasty memory leak was spotted by Thomas A. Lowery.

       Lars Thegler made me aware of problems with older Perl versions.

       Anno Siegel de-orphaned <b>each_arrayref()</b>.

       David Filmer made me aware of a problem in each_arrayref that could ultimately lead to a segfault.

       Ricardo Signes suggested the inclusion of <b>part()</b> and provided the Perl-implementation.

       Robin Huston kindly fixed a bug in perl's MULTICALL API to make the XS-implementation of <b>part()</b> work.

   <b>Jens</b> <b>Rehsack</b>
       Credits goes to all people contributing feedback during the v0.400 development releases.

       Special  thanks  goes  to  David  Golden who spent a lot of effort to develop a design to support current
       state of CPAN as well as ancient software somewhere in the dark. He also contributed a lot of patches  to
       refactor  the  API  frontend  to welcome any user of List::SomeUtils - from ancient past to recently last
       used.

       Toby Inkster provided a lot of useful feedback for sane importer code and was a nice sounding  board  for
       API discussions.

       Peter Rabbitson provided a sane git repository setup containing entire package history.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       A pile of requests from other people is still pending further processing in my mailbox. This includes:

       •   List::Util export pass-through

           Allow  <b>List::SomeUtils</b>  to  pass-through  the  regular List::Util functions to end users only need to
           "use" the one module.

       •   uniq_by(&amp;@)

           Use code-reference to extract a key based on which the uniqueness is determined. Suggested  by  Aaron
           Crane.

       •   delete_index

       •   random_item

       •   random_item_delete_index

       •   list_diff_hash

       •   list_diff_inboth

       •   list_diff_infirst

       •   list_diff_insecond

           These were all suggested by Dan Muey.

       •   listify

           Always  return  a  flat  list  when  either  a  simple scalar value was passed or an array-reference.
           Suggested by Mark Summersault.

       If  you'd  like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please consider making a "donation" to
       me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time creating free software, and would appreciate any support  you'd
       care to offer.

       Please  note  that  <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in order for me to continue working on this
       particular software. I will continue to do so, inasmuch as I  have  in  the  past,  for  as  long  as  it
       interests me.

       Similarly,  a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this software much more, unless
       I get so many donations that I can consider working on free software full time (let's all have a  chuckle
       at that together).
