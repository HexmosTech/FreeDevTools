</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       List::AllUtils - Combines List::Util, List::SomeUtils and List::UtilsBy in one bite-sized package

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.19

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use List::AllUtils qw( first any );

           # _Everything_ from List::Util, List::SomeUtils, and List::UtilsBy
           use List::AllUtils qw( :all );

           my @numbers = ( 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 );
           # or don't import anything
           return List::AllUtils::first { $_ &gt; 5 } @numbers;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Are you sick of trying to remember whether a particular helper is defined in List::Util, List::SomeUtils
       or List::UtilsBy? I sure am. Now you don't have to remember. This module will export all of the functions
       that either of those three modules defines.

       Note that all function documentation has been shamelessly copied from List::Util, List::SomeUtils and
       List::UtilsBy.

   <b>Which</b> <b>One</b> <b>Wins?</b>
       Recently, List::Util has started including some of the subs that used to only be in List::SomeUtils.
       Similarly, List::SomeUtils has some small overlap with List::UtilsBy.

       "List::AllUtils" use to always favors the subroutine provided by List::Util, List::SomeUtils or
       List::UtilsBy in that order. However, as of List::Util 1.56, it included some functions, "mesh" and "zip"
       with the same name as List::SomeUtils functions, but different behavior.

       So going forward, we will always prefer backwards compatibility. This means that "mesh" and "zip" will
       always come from List::SomeUtils. If other incompatible functions are added to List::Util, those will
       also be skipped in favor of the List::SomeUtils version.

       The docs below come from List::Util 1.56, List::SomeUtils 0.58, and List::UtilsBy 0.11.

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>IS</b> <b>EXPORTED?</b></h4><pre>
       All this module does is load List::Util, List::SomeUtils, and List::UtilsBy, and then re-export
       everything that they provide. That means that regardless of the documentation below, you will get any
       subroutine that your installed version provides.

</pre><h4><b>LIST-REDUCTION</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following set of functions all apply a given block of code to a list of values.

   <b>reduce</b>
           $result = reduce { BLOCK } @list

       Reduces @list by calling "BLOCK" in a scalar context multiple times, setting $a and $b each time. The
       first call will be with $a and $b set to the first two elements of the list, subsequent calls will be
       done by setting $a to the result of the previous call and $b to the next element in the list.

       Returns the result of the last call to the "BLOCK". If @list is empty then "undef" is returned. If @list
       only contains one element then that element is returned and "BLOCK" is not executed.

       The following examples all demonstrate how "reduce" could be used to implement the other list-reduction
       functions in this module. (They are not in fact implemented like this, but instead in a more efficient
       manner in individual C functions).

           $foo = reduce { defined($a)            ? $a :
                           $code-&gt;(local $_ = $b) ? $b :
                                                    undef } undef, @list # first

           $foo = reduce { $a &gt; $b ? $a : $b } 1..10       # max
           $foo = reduce { $a gt $b ? $a : $b } 'A'..'Z'   # maxstr
           $foo = reduce { $a &lt; $b ? $a : $b } 1..10       # min
           $foo = reduce { $a lt $b ? $a : $b } 'aa'..'zz' # minstr
           $foo = reduce { $a + $b } 1 .. 10               # sum
           $foo = reduce { $a . $b } @bar                  # concat

           $foo = reduce { $a || $code-&gt;(local $_ = $b) } 0, @bar   # any
           $foo = reduce { $a &amp;&amp; $code-&gt;(local $_ = $b) } 1, @bar   # all
           $foo = reduce { $a &amp;&amp; !$code-&gt;(local $_ = $b) } 1, @bar  # none
           $foo = reduce { $a || !$code-&gt;(local $_ = $b) } 0, @bar  # notall
              # Note that these implementations do not fully short-circuit

       If your algorithm requires that "reduce" produce an identity value, then make sure that you always pass
       that identity value as the first argument to prevent "undef" being returned

         $foo = reduce { $a + $b } 0, @values;             # sum with 0 identity value

       The above example code blocks also suggest how to use "reduce" to build a more efficient combined version
       of one of these basic functions and a "map" block. For example, to find the total length of all the
       strings in a list, we could use

           $total = sum map { length } @strings;

       However, this produces a list of temporary integer values as long as the original list of strings, only
       to reduce it down to a single value again. We can compute the same result more efficiently by using
       "reduce" with a code block that accumulates lengths by writing this instead as:

           $total = reduce { $a + length $b } 0, @strings

       The other scalar-returning list reduction functions are all specialisations of this generic idea.

   <b>reductions</b>
           @results = reductions { BLOCK } @list

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.54.</u>

       Similar to "reduce" except that it also returns the intermediate values along with the final result. As
       before, $a is set to the first element of the given list, and the "BLOCK" is then called once for
       remaining item in the list set into $b, with the result being captured for return as well as becoming the
       new value for $a.

       The returned list will begin with the initial value for $a, followed by each return value from the block
       in order. The final value of the result will be identical to what the "reduce" function would have
       returned given the same block and list.

           reduce     { "$a-$b" }  "a".."d"    # "a-b-c-d"
           reductions { "$a-$b" }  "a".."d"    # "a", "a-b", "a-b-c", "a-b-c-d"

   <b>any</b>
           my $bool = any { BLOCK } @list;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.33.</u>

       Similar to "grep" in that it evaluates "BLOCK" setting $_ to each element of @list in turn. "any" returns
       true if any element makes the "BLOCK" return a true value. If "BLOCK" never returns true or @list was
       empty then it returns false.

       Many cases of using "grep" in a conditional can be written using "any" instead, as it can short-circuit
       after the first true result.

           if( any { length &gt; 10 } @strings ) {
               # at least one string has more than 10 characters
           }

       Note: Due to XS issues the block passed may be able to access the outer @_ directly. This is not
       intentional and will break under debugger.

   <b>all</b>
           my $bool = all { BLOCK } @list;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.33.</u>

       Similar to "any", except that it requires all elements of the @list to make the "BLOCK" return true. If
       any element returns false, then it returns false. If the "BLOCK" never returns false or the @list was
       empty then it returns true.

       Note: Due to XS issues the block passed may be able to access the outer @_ directly. This is not
       intentional and will break under debugger.

   <b>none</b>
   <b>notall</b>
           my $bool = none { BLOCK } @list;

           my $bool = notall { BLOCK } @list;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.33.</u>

       Similar to "any" and "all", but with the return sense inverted. "none" returns true only if no value in
       the @list causes the "BLOCK" to return true, and "notall" returns true only if not all of the values do.

       Note: Due to XS issues the block passed may be able to access the outer @_ directly. This is not
       intentional and will break under debugger.

   <b>first</b>
           my $val = first { BLOCK } @list;

       Similar to "grep" in that it evaluates "BLOCK" setting $_ to each element of @list in turn. "first"
       returns the first element where the result from "BLOCK" is a true value. If "BLOCK" never returns true or
       @list was empty then "undef" is returned.

           $foo = first { defined($_) } @list    # first defined value in @list
           $foo = first { $_ &gt; $value } @list    # first value in @list which
                                                 # is greater than $value

   <b>max</b>
           my $num = max @list;

       Returns the entry in the list with the highest numerical value. If the list is empty then "undef" is
       returned.

           $foo = max 1..10                # 10
           $foo = max 3,9,12               # 12
           $foo = max @bar, @baz           # whatever

   <b>maxstr</b>
           my $str = maxstr @list;

       Similar to "max", but treats all the entries in the list as strings and returns the highest string as
       defined by the "gt" operator. If the list is empty then "undef" is returned.

           $foo = maxstr 'A'..'Z'          # 'Z'
           $foo = maxstr "hello","world"   # "world"
           $foo = maxstr @bar, @baz        # whatever

   <b>min</b>
           my $num = min @list;

       Similar to "max" but returns the entry in the list with the lowest numerical value. If the list is empty
       then "undef" is returned.

           $foo = min 1..10                # 1
           $foo = min 3,9,12               # 3
           $foo = min @bar, @baz           # whatever

   <b>minstr</b>
           my $str = minstr @list;

       Similar to "min", but treats all the entries in the list as strings and returns the lowest string as
       defined by the "lt" operator. If the list is empty then "undef" is returned.

           $foo = minstr 'A'..'Z'          # 'A'
           $foo = minstr "hello","world"   # "hello"
           $foo = minstr @bar, @baz        # whatever

   <b>product</b>
           my $num = product @list;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.35.</u>

       Returns the numerical product of all the elements in @list. If @list is empty then 1 is returned.

           $foo = product 1..10            # 3628800
           $foo = product 3,9,12           # 324

   <b>sum</b>
           my $num_or_undef = sum @list;

       Returns the numerical sum of all the elements in @list. For backwards compatibility, if @list is empty
       then "undef" is returned.

           $foo = sum 1..10                # 55
           $foo = sum 3,9,12               # 24
           $foo = sum @bar, @baz           # whatever

   <b>sum0</b>
           my $num = sum0 @list;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.26.</u>

       Similar to "sum", except this returns 0 when given an empty list, rather than "undef".

</pre><h4><b>KEY/VALUE</b> <b>PAIR</b> <b>LIST</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following set of functions, all inspired by List::Pairwise, consume an even-sized list of pairs. The
       pairs may be key/value associations from a hash, or just a list of values. The functions will all
       preserve the original ordering of the pairs, and will not be confused by multiple pairs having the same
       "key" value - nor even do they require that the first of each pair be a plain string.

       <b>NOTE</b>: At the time of writing, the following "pair*" functions that take a block do not modify the value
       of $_ within the block, and instead operate using the $a and $b globals instead. This has turned out to
       be a poor design, as it precludes the ability to provide a "pairsort" function. Better would be to pass
       pair-like objects as 2-element array references in $_, in a style similar to the return value of the
       "pairs" function. At some future version this behaviour may be added.

       Until then, users are alerted <b>NOT</b> to rely on the value of $_ remaining unmodified between the outside and
       the inside of the control block. In particular, the following example is <b>UNSAFE</b>:

        my @kvlist = ...

        foreach (qw( some keys here )) {
           my @items = pairgrep { $a eq $_ } @kvlist;
           ...
        }

       Instead, write this using a lexical variable:

        foreach my $key (qw( some keys here )) {
           my @items = pairgrep { $a eq $key } @kvlist;
           ...
        }

   <b>pairs</b>
           my @pairs = pairs @kvlist;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.29.</u>

       A convenient shortcut to operating on even-sized lists of pairs, this function returns a list of "ARRAY"
       references, each containing two items from the given list. It is a more efficient version of

           @pairs = pairmap { [ $a, $b ] } @kvlist

       It is most convenient to use in a "foreach" loop, for example:

           foreach my $pair ( pairs @kvlist ) {
              my ( $key, $value ) = @$pair;
              ...
           }

       Since version 1.39 these "ARRAY" references are blessed objects, recognising the two methods "key" and
       "value". The following code is equivalent:

           foreach my $pair ( pairs @kvlist ) {
              my $key   = $pair-&gt;key;
              my $value = $pair-&gt;value;
              ...
           }

       Since version 1.51 they also have a "TO_JSON" method to ease serialisation.

   <b>unpairs</b>
           my @kvlist = unpairs @pairs

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.42.</u>

       The inverse function to "pairs"; this function takes a list of "ARRAY" references containing two elements
       each, and returns a flattened list of the two values from each of the pairs, in order. This is notionally
       equivalent to

           my @kvlist = map { @{$_}[0,1] } @pairs

       except that it is implemented more efficiently internally. Specifically, for any input item it will
       extract exactly two values for the output list; using "undef" if the input array references are short.

       Between "pairs" and "unpairs", a higher-order list function can be used to operate on the pairs as single
       scalars; such as the following near-equivalents of the other "pair*" higher-order functions:

           @kvlist = unpairs grep { FUNC } pairs @kvlist
           # Like pairgrep, but takes $_ instead of $a and $b

           @kvlist = unpairs map { FUNC } pairs @kvlist
           # Like pairmap, but takes $_ instead of $a and $b

       Note however that these versions will not behave as nicely in scalar context.

       Finally, this technique can be used to implement a sort on a keyvalue pair list; e.g.:

           @kvlist = unpairs sort { $a-&gt;key cmp $b-&gt;key } pairs @kvlist

   <b>pairkeys</b>
           my @keys = pairkeys @kvlist;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.29.</u>

       A convenient shortcut to operating on even-sized lists of pairs, this function returns a list of the the
       first values of each of the pairs in the given list.  It is a more efficient version of

           @keys = pairmap { $a } @kvlist

   <b>pairvalues</b>
           my @values = pairvalues @kvlist;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.29.</u>

       A convenient shortcut to operating on even-sized lists of pairs, this function returns a list of the the
       second values of each of the pairs in the given list.  It is a more efficient version of

           @values = pairmap { $b } @kvlist

   <b>pairgrep</b>
           my @kvlist = pairgrep { BLOCK } @kvlist;

           my $count = pairgrep { BLOCK } @kvlist;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.29.</u>

       Similar to perl's "grep" keyword, but interprets the given list as an even-sized list of pairs. It
       invokes the "BLOCK" multiple times, in scalar context, with $a and $b set to successive pairs of values
       from the @kvlist.

       Returns an even-sized list of those pairs for which the "BLOCK" returned true in list context, or the
       count of the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pairs</b> in scalar context.  (Note, therefore, in scalar context that it returns a
       number half the size of the count of items it would have returned in list context).

           @subset = pairgrep { $a =~ m/^[[:upper:]]+$/ } @kvlist

       As with "grep" aliasing $_ to list elements, "pairgrep" aliases $a and $b to elements of the given list.
       Any modifications of it by the code block will be visible to the caller.

   <b>pairfirst</b>
           my ( $key, $val ) = pairfirst { BLOCK } @kvlist;

           my $found = pairfirst { BLOCK } @kvlist;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.30.</u>

       Similar to the "first" function, but interprets the given list as an even-sized list of pairs. It invokes
       the "BLOCK" multiple times, in scalar context, with $a and $b set to successive pairs of values from the
       @kvlist.

       Returns the first pair of values from the list for which the "BLOCK" returned true in list context, or an
       empty list of no such pair was found. In scalar context it returns a simple boolean value, rather than
       either the key or the value found.

           ( $key, $value ) = pairfirst { $a =~ m/^[[:upper:]]+$/ } @kvlist

       As with "grep" aliasing $_ to list elements, "pairfirst" aliases $a and $b to elements of the given list.
       Any modifications of it by the code block will be visible to the caller.

   <b>pairmap</b>
           my @list = pairmap { BLOCK } @kvlist;

           my $count = pairmap { BLOCK } @kvlist;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.29.</u>

       Similar to perl's "map" keyword, but interprets the given list as an even-sized list of pairs. It invokes
       the "BLOCK" multiple times, in list context, with $a and $b set to successive pairs of values from the
       @kvlist.

       Returns the concatenation of all the values returned by the "BLOCK" in list context, or the count of the
       number of items that would have been returned in scalar context.

           @result = pairmap { "The key $a has value $b" } @kvlist

       As with "map" aliasing $_ to list elements, "pairmap" aliases $a and $b to elements of the given list.
       Any modifications of it by the code block will be visible to the caller.

       See "KNOWN BUGS" for a known-bug with "pairmap", and a workaround.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>shuffle</b>
           my @values = shuffle @values;

       Returns the values of the input in a random order

           @cards = shuffle 0..51      # 0..51 in a random order

       This function is affected by the $RAND variable.

   <b>sample</b>
           my @items = sample $count, @values

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.54.</u>

       Randomly select the given number of elements from the input list. Any given position in the input list
       will be selected at most once.

       If there are fewer than $count items in the list then the function will return once all of them have been
       randomly selected; effectively the function behaves similarly to "shuffle".

       This function is affected by the $RAND variable.

   <b>uniq</b>
           my @subset = uniq @values

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.45.</u>

       Filters a list of values to remove subsequent duplicates, as judged by a DWIM-ish string equality or
       "undef" test. Preserves the order of unique elements, and retains the first value of any duplicate set.

           my $count = uniq @values

       In scalar context, returns the number of elements that would have been returned as a list.

       The "undef" value is treated by this function as distinct from the empty string, and no warning will be
       produced. It is left as-is in the returned list. Subsequent "undef" values are still considered identical
       to the first, and will be removed.

   <b>uniqint</b>
           my @subset = uniqint @values

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.55.</u>

       Filters a list of values to remove subsequent duplicates, as judged by an integer numerical equality
       test. Preserves the order of unique elements, and retains the first value of any duplicate set. Values in
       the returned list will be coerced into integers.

           my $count = uniqint @values

       In scalar context, returns the number of elements that would have been returned as a list.

       Note that "undef" is treated much as other numerical operations treat it; it compares equal to zero but
       additionally produces a warning if such warnings are enabled ("use warnings 'uninitialized';"). In
       addition, an "undef" in the returned list is coerced into a numerical zero, so that the entire list of
       values returned by "uniqint" are well-behaved as integers.

   <b>uniqnum</b>
           my @subset = uniqnum @values

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.44.</u>

       Filters a list of values to remove subsequent duplicates, as judged by a numerical equality test.
       Preserves the order of unique elements, and retains the first value of any duplicate set.

           my $count = uniqnum @values

       In scalar context, returns the number of elements that would have been returned as a list.

       Note that "undef" is treated much as other numerical operations treat it; it compares equal to zero but
       additionally produces a warning if such warnings are enabled ("use warnings 'uninitialized';"). In
       addition, an "undef" in the returned list is coerced into a numerical zero, so that the entire list of
       values returned by "uniqnum" are well-behaved as numbers.

       Note also that multiple IEEE "NaN" values are treated as duplicates of each other, regardless of any
       differences in their payloads, and despite the fact that "0+'NaN' == 0+'NaN'" yields false.

   <b>uniqstr</b>
           my @subset = uniqstr @values

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.45.</u>

       Filters a list of values to remove subsequent duplicates, as judged by a string equality test. Preserves
       the order of unique elements, and retains the first value of any duplicate set.

           my $count = uniqstr @values

       In scalar context, returns the number of elements that would have been returned as a list.

       Note that "undef" is treated much as other string operations treat it; it compares equal to the empty
       string but additionally produces a warning if such warnings are enabled ("use warnings
       'uninitialized';"). In addition, an "undef" in the returned list is coerced into an empty string, so that
       the entire list of values returned by "uniqstr" are well-behaved as strings.

   <b>head</b>
           my @values = head $size, @list;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.50.</u>

       Returns the first $size elements from @list. If $size is negative, returns all but the last $size
       elements from @list.

           @result = head 2, qw( foo bar baz );

   <b>Junctions</b>
       <u>Treatment</u> <u>of</u> <u>an</u> <u>empty</u> <u>list</u>

       There are two schools of thought for how to evaluate a junction on an empty list:

       •   Reduction to an identity (boolean)

       •   Result is undefined (three-valued)

       In  the  first case, the result of the junction applied to the empty list is determined by a mathematical
       reduction to an identity depending on whether the underlying comparison is "or" or "and".  Conceptually:

                           "any are true"      "all are true"
                           --------------      --------------
           2 elements:     A || B || 0         A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; 1
           1 element:      A || 0              A &amp;&amp; 1
           0 elements:     0                   1

       In the second case, three-value logic is desired, in which a junction applied to an  empty  list  returns
       "undef" rather than true or false

       Junctions with a "_u" suffix implement three-valued logic.  Those without are boolean.

       <u>all</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>all_u</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  a  true value if all items in LIST meet the criterion given through BLOCK. Sets $_ for each item
       in LIST in turn:

         print "All values are non-negative"
           if all { $_ &gt;= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);

       For an empty LIST, "all" returns true (i.e. no values failed the condition) and "all_u" returns "undef".

       Thus, "all_u(@list)" is equivalent to "@list ? all(@list) : undef".

       <b>Note</b>: because Perl treats "undef" as false, you must check the return value of "all_u" with "defined"  or
       you will get the opposite result of what you expect.

       <u>any</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>any_u</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  a  true value if any item in LIST meets the criterion given through BLOCK. Sets $_ for each item
       in LIST in turn:

         print "At least one non-negative value"
           if any { $_ &gt;= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);

       For an empty LIST, "any" returns false and "any_u" returns "undef".

       Thus, "any_u(@list)" is equivalent to "@list ? any(@list) : undef".

       <u>none</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>none_u</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Logically the negation of "any". Returns a true value if no  item  in  LIST  meets  the  criterion  given
       through BLOCK. Sets $_ for each item in LIST in turn:

         print "No non-negative values"
           if none { $_ &gt;= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);

       For  an  empty  LIST,  "none"  returns  true  (i.e.  no values failed the condition) and "none_u" returns
       "undef".

       Thus, "none_u(@list)" is equivalent to "@list ? none(@list) : undef".

       <b>Note</b>: because Perl treats "undef" as false, you must check the return value of "none_u" with "defined" or
       you will get the opposite result of what you expect.

       <u>notall</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>notall_u</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Logically the negation of "all". Returns a true value if not all items in LIST meet the  criterion  given
       through BLOCK. Sets $_ for each item in LIST in turn:

         print "Not all values are non-negative"
           if notall { $_ &gt;= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);

       For an empty LIST, "notall" returns false and "notall_u" returns "undef".

       Thus, "notall_u(@list)" is equivalent to "@list ? notall(@list) : undef".

       <u>one</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>one_u</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  a  true value if precisely one item in LIST meets the criterion given through BLOCK. Sets $_ for
       each item in LIST in turn:

           print "Precisely one value defined"
               if one { defined($_) } @list;

       Returns false otherwise.

       For an empty LIST, "one" returns false and "one_u" returns "undef".

       The expression "one BLOCK LIST" is almost equivalent to "1 == true BLOCK LIST", except for short-cutting.
       Evaluation of BLOCK will immediately stop at the second true value.

   <b>Transformation</b>
       <u>apply</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Makes a copy of the list and then passes each element  <u>from</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>copy</u>  to  the  BLOCK.  Any  changes  or
       assignments  to  $_  in  the  BLOCK  will  only  affect the elements of the new list. However, if $_ is a
       reference then changes to the referenced value will be seen in both the original and new list.

       This function is similar to "map" but will not modify the elements of the input list:

         my @list = (1 .. 4);
         my @mult = apply { $_ *= 2 } @list;
         print "\@list = @list\n";
         print "\@mult = @mult\n";
         __END__
         @list = 1 2 3 4
         @mult = 2 4 6 8

       Think of it as syntactic sugar for

         for (my @mult = @list) { $_ *= 2 }

       Note that you must alter $_ directly inside BLOCK in order for changes to make effect. New value returned
       from the BLOCK are ignored:

         # @new is identical to @list.
         my @new = apply { $_ * 2 } @list;

         # @new is different from @list
         my @new = apply { $_ =* 2 } @list;

       <u>insert_after</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>VALUE</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Inserts VALUE after the first item in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK is true.  Sets  $_  for  each
       item in LIST in turn.

         my @list = qw/This is a list/;
         insert_after { $_ eq "a" } "longer" =&gt; @list;
         print "@list";
         __END__
         This is a longer list

       <u>insert_after_string</u> <u>STRING</u> <u>VALUE</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Inserts VALUE after the first item in LIST which is equal to STRING.

         my @list = qw/This is a list/;
         insert_after_string "a", "longer" =&gt; @list;
         print "@list";
         __END__
         This is a longer list

       <u>pairwise</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>ARRAY1</u> <u>ARRAY2</u>

       Evaluates  BLOCK  for  each  pair  of  elements in ARRAY1 and ARRAY2 and returns a new list consisting of
       BLOCK's return values. The two elements are set to $a and $b.  Note that those two  are  aliases  to  the
       original value so changing them will modify the input arrays.

         @a = (1 .. 5);
         @b = (11 .. 15);
         @x = pairwise { $a + $b } @a, @b;     # returns 12, 14, 16, 18, 20

         # mesh with pairwise
         @a = qw/a b c/;
         @b = qw/1 2 3/;
         @x = pairwise { ($a, $b) } @a, @b;    # returns a, 1, b, 2, c, 3

       <u>mesh</u> <u>ARRAY1</u> <u>ARRAY2</u> <u>[</u> <u>ARRAY3</u> <u>...</u> <u>]</u>

       <u>zip</u> <u>ARRAY1</u> <u>ARRAY2</u> <u>[</u> <u>ARRAY3</u> <u>...</u> <u>]</u>

       Returns  a  list  consisting  of  the first elements of each array, then the second, then the third, etc,
       until all arrays are exhausted.

       Examples:

         @x = qw/a b c d/;
         @y = qw/1 2 3 4/;
         @z = mesh @x, @y;         # returns a, 1, b, 2, c, 3, d, 4

         @a = ('x');
         @b = ('1', '2');
         @c = qw/zip zap zot/;
         @d = mesh @a, @b, @c;   # x, 1, zip, undef, 2, zap, undef, undef, zot

       "zip" is an alias for "mesh".

       <u>uniq</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>distinct</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns a new list by stripping duplicate values in LIST by comparing the values  as  hash  keys,  except
       that  undef is considered separate from ''.  The order of elements in the returned list is the same as in
       LIST. In scalar context, returns the number of unique elements in LIST.

         my @x = uniq 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 3, 4; # returns 1 2 3 5 4
         my $x = uniq 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 3, 4; # returns 5
         # returns "Mike", "Michael", "Richard", "Rick"
         my @n = distinct "Mike", "Michael", "Richard", "Rick", "Michael", "Rick"
         # returns '', undef, 'S1', A5'
         my @s = distinct '', undef, 'S1', 'A5'
         # returns '', undef, 'S1', A5'
         my @w = uniq undef, '', 'S1', 'A5'

       "distinct" is an alias for "uniq".

       <b>RT#49800</b> can be used to give feedback about this behavior.

       <u>singleton</u>

       Returns a new list by stripping values in LIST occurring more than once by comparing the values  as  hash
       keys,  except  that  undef is considered separate from ''.  The order of elements in the returned list is
       the same as in LIST.  In scalar context, returns the number of elements occurring only once in LIST.

         my @x = singleton 1,1,2,2,3,4,5 # returns 3 4 5

   <b>Partitioning</b>
       <u>after</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns a list of the values of LIST after (and not including) the  point  where  BLOCK  returns  a  true
       value. Sets $_ for each element in LIST in turn.

         @x = after { $_ % 5 == 0 } (1..9);    # returns 6, 7, 8, 9

       <u>after_incl</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Same as "after" but also includes the element for which BLOCK is true.

       <u>before</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  a  list  of values of LIST up to (and not including) the point where BLOCK returns a true value.
       Sets $_ for each element in LIST in turn.

       <u>before_incl</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Same as "before" but also includes the element for which BLOCK is true.

       <u>part</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Partitions LIST based on the return value of BLOCK which denotes into which partition the  current  value
       is put.

       Returns a list of the partitions thusly created. Each partition created is a reference to an array.

         my $i = 0;
         my @part = part { $i++ % 2 } 1 .. 8;   # returns [1, 3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8]

       You can have a sparse list of partitions as well where non-set partitions will be undef:

         my @part = part { 2 } 1 .. 10;            # returns undef, undef, [ 1 .. 10 ]

       Be careful with negative values, though:

         my @part = part { -1 } 1 .. 10;
         __END__
         Modification of non-creatable array value attempted, subscript -1 ...

       Negative values are only ok when they refer to a partition previously created:

         my @idx  = ( 0, 1, -1 );
         my $i    = 0;
         my @part = part { $idx[$i++ % 3] } 1 .. 8; # [1, 4, 7], [2, 3, 5, 6, 8]

   <b>Iteration</b>
       <u>each_array</u> <u>ARRAY1</u> <u>ARRAY2</u> <u>...</u>

       Creates  an  array iterator to return the elements of the list of arrays ARRAY1, ARRAY2 throughout ARRAYn
       in turn.  That is, the first time it is called, it returns the first element of  each  array.   The  next
       time, it returns the second elements.  And so on, until all elements are exhausted.

       This is useful for looping over more than one array at once:

         my $ea = each_array(@a, @b, @c);
         while ( my ($a, $b, $c) = $ea-&gt;() )   { .... }

       The iterator returns the empty list when it reached the end of all arrays.

       If  the iterator is passed an argument of '"index"', then it returns the index of the last fetched set of
       values, as a scalar.

       <u>each_arrayref</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Like each_array, but the arguments are references to arrays, not the plain arrays.

       <u>natatime</u> <u>EXPR,</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Creates an array iterator, for looping over an array in chunks of $n items at a time.  (n at a time,  get
       it?).  An example is probably a better explanation than I could give in words.

       Example:

         my @x = ('a' .. 'g');
         my $it = natatime 3, @x;
         while (my @vals = $it-&gt;())
         {
           print "@vals\n";
         }

       This prints

         a b c
         d e f
         g

   <b>Searching</b>
       <u>bsearch</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Performs  a  binary  search  on  LIST which must be a sorted list of values. BLOCK must return a negative
       value if the current element (stored in $_) is smaller, a positive value if it is bigger and zero  if  it
       matches.

       Returns  a  boolean  value  in  scalar  context. In list context, it returns the element if it was found,
       otherwise the empty list.

       <u>bsearchidx</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>bsearch_index</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Performs a binary search on LIST which must be a sorted list of values.  BLOCK  must  return  a  negative
       value  if  the current element (stored in $_) is smaller, a positive value if it is bigger and zero if it
       matches.

       Returns the index of found element, otherwise "-1".

       "bsearch_index" is an alias for "bsearchidx".

       <u>firstval</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>first_value</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns the first element in LIST for which BLOCK evaluates to true. Each element of LIST is set to $_ in

       <u>onlyval</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>only_value</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns the only element in LIST for which BLOCK evaluates to true. Sets $_ for  each  item  in  LIST  in
       turn. Returns "undef" if no such element has been found.

       "only_value" is an alias for "onlyval".

       <u>lastval</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>last_value</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  the  last  value in LIST for which BLOCK evaluates to true. Each element of LIST is set to $_ in
       turn. Returns "undef" if no such element has been found.

       "last_value" is an alias for "lastval".

       <u>firstres</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>first_result</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns the result of BLOCK for the first element in LIST for which BLOCK evaluates to true. Each element
       of LIST is set to $_ in turn. Returns "undef" if no such element has been found.

       "first_result" is an alias for "firstres".

       <u>onlyres</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>only_result</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns the result of BLOCK for the first element in LIST for which BLOCK evaluates to true. Sets $_  for

       "only_result" is an alias for "onlyres".

       <u>lastres</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>last_result</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns  the result of BLOCK for the last element in LIST for which BLOCK evaluates to true. Each element
       of LIST is set to $_ in turn. Returns "undef" if no such element has been found.

       "last_result" is an alias for "lastres".

       <u>indexes</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Evaluates BLOCK for each element in LIST (assigned to $_) and returns a list  of  the  indices  of  those
       elements  for  which  BLOCK  returned a true value. This is just like "grep" only that it returns indices
       instead of values:

         @x = indexes { $_ % 2 == 0 } (1..10);   # returns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

       <u>firstidx</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       <u>first_index</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns the index of the first element in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK is true. Sets $_ for each

         printf "item with index %i in list is 4", firstidx { $_ == 4 } @list;
         __END__

           printf "uniqe index of item 2 in list is %i", onlyidx { $_ == 2 } @list;
           __END__
           unique index of item 2 in list is 4

       Returns "-1" if either no such item or more than one of these has been found.

       "only_index" is an alias for "onlyidx".

       <u>lastidx</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns "-1" if no such item could be found.

       "last_index" is an alias for "lastidx".

   <b>Sorting</b>
       <u>sort_by</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Returns the list of values sorted according to the  string  values  returned  by  the  KEYFUNC  block  or
       function.  A  typical  use of this may be to sort objects according to the string value of some accessor,
       such as

         sort_by { $_-&gt;name } @people

       The key function is called in scalar context, being passed each value in turn as both  $_  and  the  only
       argument  in the parameters, @_. The values are then sorted according to string comparisons on the values
       returned.  This is equivalent to

         sort { $a-&gt;name cmp $b-&gt;name } @people

       except that it guarantees the name accessor will be executed only once per value.  One  interesting  use-
       case is to sort strings which may have numbers embedded in them "naturally", rather than lexically.

         sort_by { s/(\d+)/sprintf "%09d", $1/eg; $_ } @strings

       This sorts strings by generating sort keys which zero-pad the embedded numbers to some level (9 digits in
       this case), helping to ensure the lexical sort puts them in the correct order.

       <u>nsort_by</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Similar to sort_by but compares its key values numerically.

   <b>Counting</b> <b>and</b> <b>calculation</b>
       <u>true</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Counts  the  number of elements in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK is true.  Sets $_ for  each item
       in LIST in turn:

         printf "%i item(s) are defined", true { defined($_) } @list;

       <u>false</u> <u>BLOCK</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Counts the number of elements in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK is false.  Sets $_ for  each  item
       in LIST in turn:

         printf "%i item(s) are not defined", false { defined($_) } @list;

       <u>minmax</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Calculates  the  minimum  and maximum of LIST and returns a two element list with the first element being
       the minimum and the second the maximum. Returns the empty list if LIST was empty.

       The "minmax" algorithm differs from a naive iteration over the list where each element is compared to two
       values being the so far calculated min and max value in that it only requires 3n/2 - 2 comparisons.  Thus
       it is the most efficient possible algorithm.

       However, the Perl implementation of it has some overhead simply due to the fact that there are more lines
       of  Perl  code involved. Therefore, LIST needs to be fairly big in order for "minmax" to win over a naive
       implementation. This limitation does not apply to the XS version.

       <u>mode</u> <u>LIST</u>

       Calculates the most common items in the list and returns them as a list.  This  is  effectively  done  by
       string comparisons, so references will be stringified. If they implement string overloading, this will be
       used.

       If  more than one item appears the same number of times in the list, all such items will be returned. For
       example, the mode of a unique list is the list itself.

       This function returns a list in list context. In scalar context it returns a count indicating the  number
       of modes in the list.

</pre><h4><b>List::UtilsBy</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All  functions  added  since  version  0.04  unless  otherwise  stated, as the original names for earlier
       versions were renamed.

   <b>sort_by</b>
          @vals = sort_by { KEYFUNC } @vals

       Returns the list of values sorted according to the string values  returned  by  the  "KEYFUNC"  block  or
       function.  A  typical  use of this may be to sort objects according to the string value of some accessor,
       such as

          sort_by { $_-&gt;name } @people

       The key function is called in scalar context, being passed each value in turn as both  $_  and  the  only
       argument  in the parameters, @_. The values are then sorted according to string comparisons on the values
       returned.

       This is equivalent to

          sort { $a-&gt;name cmp $b-&gt;name } @people

       except that it guarantees the "name" accessor will be executed only once per value.

       One interesting use-case is to sort strings which may have numbers embedded in them  "naturally",  rather
       than lexically.

          sort_by { s/(\d+)/sprintf "%09d", $1/eg; $_ } @strings

       This sorts strings by generating sort keys which zero-pad the embedded numbers to some level (9 digits in
       this case), helping to ensure the lexical sort puts them in the correct order.

   <b>nsort_by</b>
          @vals = nsort_by { KEYFUNC } @vals

       Similar to "sort_by" but compares its key values numerically.

   <b>rev_sort_by</b>
   <b>rev_nsort_by</b>
          @vals = rev_sort_by { KEYFUNC } @vals

          @vals = rev_nsort_by { KEYFUNC } @vals

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.06.</u>

       Similar to "sort_by" and "nsort_by" but returns the list in the reverse order. Equivalent to

          @vals = reverse sort_by { KEYFUNC } @vals

       except that these functions are slightly more efficient because they avoid the final "reverse" operation.

   <b>max_by</b>
          $optimal = max_by { KEYFUNC } @vals

          @optimal = max_by { KEYFUNC } @vals

       Returns the (first) value from @vals that gives the numerically largest result from the key function.

          my $tallest = max_by { $_-&gt;height } @people

          use File::stat qw( stat );
          my $newest = max_by { stat($_)-&gt;mtime } @files;

       In scalar context, the first maximal value is returned. In list context, a list of all the maximal values
       is returned. This may be used to obtain positions other than the first, if order is significant.

       If called on an empty list, an empty list is returned.

       For  symmetry  with  the  "nsort_by"  function,  this  is also provided under the name "nmax_by" since it
       behaves numerically.

   <b>min_by</b>
          $optimal = min_by { KEYFUNC } @vals

          @optimal = min_by { KEYFUNC } @vals

       Similar to "max_by" but returns values which give the numerically smallest result from the key  function.
       Also provided as "nmin_by"

   <b>minmax_by</b>
          ( $minimal, $maximal ) = minmax_by { KEYFUNC } @vals

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.11.</u>

       Similar  to  calling both "min_by" and "max_by" with the same key function on the same list. This version
       is more efficient than calling the two other functions individually, as  it  has  less  work  to  perform
       overall.  In  the  case  of  ties,  only  the  first optimal element found in each case is returned. Also
       provided as "nminmax_by".

   <b>uniq_by</b>
          @vals = uniq_by { KEYFUNC } @vals

       Returns a list of the subset of values for which the key function block returns unique values. The  first
       value yielding a particular key is chosen, subsequent values are rejected.

          my @some_fruit = uniq_by { $_-&gt;colour } @fruit;

       To  select  instead  the  last  value  per  key,  reverse  the input list. If the order of the results is
       significant, don't forget to reverse the result as well:

          my @some_fruit = reverse uniq_by { $_-&gt;colour } reverse @fruit;

       Because the values returned by the key function are used as hash keys, they ought to either  be  strings,
       or at least well-behaved as strings (such as numbers, or object references which overload stringification
       in a suitable manner).

   <b>partition_by</b>
          %parts = partition_by { KEYFUNC } @vals

       Returns  a  key/value  list of ARRAY refs containing all the original values distributed according to the
       result of the key function block. Each value will be  an  ARRAY  ref  containing  all  the  values  which
       returned the string from the key function, in their original order.

          my %balls_by_colour = partition_by { $_-&gt;colour } @balls;

       Because  the  values returned by the key function are used as hash keys, they ought to either be strings,
       or at least well-behaved as strings (such as numbers, or object references which overload stringification
       in a suitable manner).

   <b>count_by</b>
          %counts = count_by { KEYFUNC } @vals

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.07.</u>

       Returns a key/value list of integers, giving the number of times the key function block returned the key,
       for each value in the list.

          my %count_of_balls = count_by { $_-&gt;colour } @balls;

       Because the values returned by the key function are used as hash keys, they ought to either  be  strings,
       or at least well-behaved as strings (such as numbers, or object references which overload stringification
       in a suitable manner).

   <b>zip_by</b>
          @vals = zip_by { ITEMFUNC } \@arr0, \@arr1, \@arr2,...

       Returns a list of each of the values returned by the function block, when invoked with values from across
       each  each  of  the  given  ARRAY  references.  Each value in the returned list will be the result of the
       function having been invoked with arguments at that position, from across each of the arrays given.

          my @transposition = zip_by { [ @_ ] } @matrix;

          my @names = zip_by { "$_[1], $_[0]" } \@firstnames, \@surnames;

          print zip_by { "$_[0] =&gt; $_[1]\n" } [ keys %hash ], [ values %hash ];

       If some of the arrays are shorter than others, the function will behave as if they  had  "undef"  in  the
       trailing positions. The following two lines are equivalent:

          zip_by { f(@_) } [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ "a", "b" ]
          f( 1, "a" ), f( 2, "b" ), f( 3, undef )

       The item function is called by "map", so if it returns a list, the entire list is included in the result.
       This can be useful for example, for generating a hash from two separate lists of keys and values

          my %nums = zip_by { @_ } [qw( one two three )], [ 1, 2, 3 ];
          # %nums = ( one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, three =&gt; 3 )

       (A function having this behaviour is sometimes called "zipWith", e.g. in Haskell, but that name would not
       fit the naming scheme used by this module).

   <b>unzip_by</b>
          $arr0, $arr1, $arr2, ... = unzip_by { ITEMFUNC } @vals

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.09.</u>

       Returns a list of ARRAY references containing the values returned by the function block, when invoked for
       each  of  the  values  given  in  the input list.  Each of the returned ARRAY references will contain the
       values returned at that corresponding position by the function block. That is, the first  returned  ARRAY
       reference  will  contain  all the values returned in the first position by the function block, the second
       will contain all the values from the second position, and so on.

          my ( $firstnames, $lastnames ) = unzip_by { m/^(.*?) (.*)$/ } @names;

       If the function returns lists of differing lengths, the result will be padded with "undef" in the missing
       elements.

       This function is an inverse of "zip_by", if given a corresponding inverse function.

   <b>extract_by</b>
          @vals = extract_by { SELECTFUNC } @arr

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.05.</u>

       Removes elements from the referenced array on which the selection function returns true,  and  returns  a
       list  containing  those  elements.  This  function  is  similar  to  "grep",  except that it modifies the
       referenced array to remove the selected values from it, leaving only the unselected ones.

          my @red_balls = extract_by { $_-&gt;color eq "red" } @balls;

          # Now there are no red balls in the @balls array

       This function modifies a real array, unlike most of the other functions in this module. Because of  this,
       it requires a real array, not just a list.

       This  function  is  implemented  by  invoking  "splice"  on the array, not by constructing a new list and
       assigning it. One result of this is that weak references will not be disturbed.

          extract_by { !defined $_ } @refs;

       will leave weak references weakened in the @refs array, whereas

          @refs = grep { defined $_ } @refs;

       will strengthen them all again.

   <b>extract_first_by</b>
          $val = extract_first_by { SELECTFUNC } @arr

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.10.</u>

       A hybrid between "extract_by" and "List::Util::first". Removes the  first  element  from  the  referenced
       array on which the selection function returns true, returning it.

       As  with  "extract_by",  this function requires a real array and not just a list, and is also implemented
       using "splice" so that weak references are not disturbed.

       If this function fails to find a matching element, it will return an empty list  in  list  context.  This
       allows a caller to distinguish the case between no matching element, and the first matching element being
       "undef".

   <b>weighted_shuffle_by</b>
          @vals = weighted_shuffle_by { WEIGHTFUNC } @vals

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.07.</u>

       Returns  the  list of values shuffled into a random order. The randomisation is not uniform, but weighted
       by the value returned by the "WEIGHTFUNC". The probabilty of each  item  being  returned  first  will  be
       distributed with the distribution of the weights, and so on recursively for the remaining items.

   <b>bundle_by</b>
          @vals = bundle_by { BLOCKFUNC } $number, @vals

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.07.</u>

       Similar  to a regular "map" functional, returns a list of the values returned by "BLOCKFUNC". Values from
       the input list are given to the block function in bundles of $number.

       If given a list of values whose length does not evenly divide by $number, the final call will  be  passed
       fewer elements than the others.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       List::Util,  List::SomeUtils and List::UtilsBy, obviously.

       Also see "Util::Any", which unifies many more util modules, and also lets you rename functions as part of
       the import.

       If  you'd  like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please consider making a "donation" to
       me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time creating free software, and would appreciate any support  you'd
       care to offer.

       Please  note  that  <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in order for me to continue working on this
       particular software. I will continue to do so, inasmuch as I  have  in  the  past,  for  as  long  as  it
       interests me.

       Similarly,  a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this software much more, unless
       I get so many donations that I can consider working on free software full time (let's all have a  chuckle
       at that together).

       To   donate,   log   into   PayPal   and   send   money   to  <a href="mailto:autarch@urth.org">autarch@urth.org</a>,  or  use  the  button  at
