</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CURLOPT_RESOLVE - provide custom hostname to IP address resolves

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_RESOLVE,
                                 struct curl_slist *hosts);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pass  a  pointer  to  a linked list of strings with hostname resolve information to use for requests with
       this handle. The linked list should be a fully valid list of <b>struct</b> <b>curl_slist</b>  structs  properly  filled
       in. Use <u><a href="../man3/curl_slist_append.3.html">curl_slist_append</a>(3)</u> to create the list and <u><a href="../man3/curl_slist_free_all.3.html">curl_slist_free_all</a>(3)</u> to clean up an entire list.

       libcurl does not copy the list, it needs to be kept around until after the transfer has completed.

       Each resolve rule to add should be written using the format

       [+]HOST:PORT:ADDRESS[,ADDRESS]

       HOST  is the name libcurl wants to resolve, PORT is the port number of the service where libcurl wants to
       connect to the HOST and ADDRESS is one or more  numerical  IP  addresses.  If  you  specify  multiple  IP
       addresses  they  need  to be separated by comma. If libcurl is built to support IPv6, each of the ADDRESS
       entries can of course be either IPv4 or IPv6 style addressing.

       Specify the host as a single asterisk (<u>*</u>) to match all names. This  wildcard  is  resolved  last  so  any
       resolve with a specific host and port number is given priority.

       This  option  effectively  populates  the  DNS cache with entries for the host+port pair so redirects and
       everything that operations against the HOST+PORT instead use your provided ADDRESS.

       The optional leading plus (<u>+</u>) specifies that the new entry should timeout.   Entries  added  without  the
       leading  plus character never times out whereas entries added with <u>+HOST:...</u> times out just like ordinary
       DNS cache entries.

       If the DNS cache already has an entry for the given host+port pair, the new entry  overrides  the  former
       one.

       An  ADDRESS provided by this option is only used if not restricted by the setting of <u><a href="../man3/CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE.3.html">CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE</a>(3)</u>
       to a different IP version.

       To remove names from the DNS cache again, to stop providing these fake resolves, include a string in  the
       linked list that uses the format

       -HOST:PORT

       The  entry  to  remove  must be prefixed with a dash, and the hostname and port number must exactly match
       what was added previously.

       Provide IPv6 addresses within [brackets].

       Using this option multiple times makes the last set list override the previous ones. Set it  to  NULL  to
       disable its use again.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b></h4><pre>
       NULL

</pre><h4><b>PROTOCOLS</b></h4><pre>
       This functionality affects all supported protocols

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       int main(void)
       {
         CURL *curl;
         struct curl_slist *host = NULL;
         host = curl_slist_append(NULL, "example.com:443:127.0.0.1");
         host = curl_slist_append(host, "example.com:443:[2001:db8::252f:efd6]");

         curl = curl_easy_init();
         if(curl) {
           curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_RESOLVE, host);
           curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

           curl_easy_perform(curl);

           /* always cleanup */
           curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
         }

         curl_slist_free_all(host);
       }

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Added in 7.21.3. Removal support added in 7.42.0.

       Support for providing the ADDRESS within [brackets] was added in 7.57.0.

       Support for providing multiple IP addresses per entry was added in 7.59.0.

       Support for adding non-permanent entries by using the "+" prefix was added in 7.75.0.

       Support for specifying the host component as an IPv6 address was added in 8.13.0.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Added in curl 7.21.3

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_setopt.3.html">curl_easy_setopt</a>(3)</u> returns a CURLcode indicating success or error.

       CURLE_OK (0) means everything was OK, non-zero means an error occurred, see <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-errors.3.html">libcurl-errors</a>(3)</u>.
