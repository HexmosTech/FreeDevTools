</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       touchscreen input device

       The wl_touch interface represents a touchscreen associated with a seat.

       Touch interactions can consist of one or more contacts. For each contact, a series of events is
       generated, starting with a down event, followed by zero or more motion events, and ending with an up
       event. Events relating to the same contact point can be identified by the ID of the sequence.

   <b>enum</b> <b>class</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::wrapper_type</b> <b>[strong],</b>  <b>[inherited]</b>
       Underlying wl_proxy type and properties of a <b>proxy_t</b> that affect construction, destruction, and event
       handling

       <b>Enumerator</b>

       <u>standard</u>
              C pointer is a standard type compatible with wl_proxy*. Events are dispatched and it is destructed
              when the <b>proxy_t</b> is destructed. User data is set.

       <u>display</u>
              C  pointer  is  a  wl_display*. No events are dispatched, wl_display_disconnect is called when the
              <b>proxy_t</b> is destructed. User data is set.

       <u>foreign</u>
              C pointer is a standard type compatible with wl_proxy*, but another library owns it and it  should
              not  be  touched  in  a  way  that  could affect the operation of the other library. No events are
              dispatched, wl_proxy_destroy is not called when the  <b>proxy_t</b>  is  destructed,  user  data  is  not
              touched.  Consequently,  there is no reference counting for the <b>proxy_t</b>. Lifetime of such wrappers
              should preferably be short to minimize the chance that the owning library decides to  destroy  the
              wl_proxy.

       <u>proxy_wrapper</u>
              C  pointer  is  a  wl_proxy*  that  was  constructed  with  wl_proxy_create_wrapper. No events are
              dispatched, wl_proxy_wrapper_destroy is called when the <b>proxy_t</b> is destroyed.  Reference  counting
              is  active.  A reference to the <b>proxy_t</b> creating this proxy wrapper is held to extend its lifetime
              until after the proxy wrapper is destroyed.

   <b>wl_proxy</b> <b>*</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::c_ptr</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Get a pointer to the underlying C struct.

       <b>Returns</b>
           The underlying wl_proxy wrapped by this <b>proxy_t</b> if it exists, otherwise an exception is thrown

   <b>bool</b> <b>touch_t::can_release</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b>
       Check whether the <b>release</b> function is available with the currently bound version of the protocol.

       Definition at line <b>3243</b> of file <b>wayland-client-protocol.cpp</b>.

   <b>std::string</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::get_class</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Get the interface name (class) of a proxy object.

       <b>Returns</b>
           The interface name of the object associated with the proxy

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::get_id</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Get the id of a proxy object.

       <b>Returns</b>
           The id the object associated with the proxy

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::get_version</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Get the protocol object version of a proxy object. Gets the protocol object version of a proxy object, or
       0 if the proxy was created with unversioned API.

       A returned value of 0 means that no version information is  available,  so  the  caller  must  make  safe
       assumptions about the object's real version.

       <b>display_t</b> will always return version 0.

       <b>Returns</b>
           The protocol object version of the proxy or 0

   <b>wrapper_type</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::get_wrapper_type</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inline],</b>  <b>[inherited]</b>
       Get the type of a proxy object.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void()&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>touch_t::on_cancel</b> <b>()</b>
       touch  session  cancelled Sent if the compositor decides the touch stream is a global gesture. No further
       events are sent to the clients from that particular gesture. Touch  cancellation  applies  to  all  touch
       points  currently  active  on  this  client's surface. The client is responsible for finalizing the touch
       points, future touch points on this surface may reuse the touch point ID.

       Definition at line <b>3269</b> of file <b>wayland-client-protocol.cpp</b>.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(uint32_t,</b> <b>uint32_t,</b> <b>surface_t,</b> <b>int32_t,</b> <b>double,</b> <b>double)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>touch_t::on_down</b> <b>()</b>
       touch down event and beginning of a touch sequence

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>serial</u> serial number of the touch down event
           <u>time</u> timestamp with millisecond granularity
           <u>surface</u> surface touched
           <u>id</u> the unique ID of this touch point
           <u>x</u> surface-local x coordinate
           <u>y</u> surface-local y coordinate

       A new touch point has appeared on the surface. This touch point is assigned a unique  ID.  Future  events
       from  this  touch  point  reference  this ID. The ID ceases to be valid after a touch up event and may be
       reused in the future.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void()&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>touch_t::on_frame</b> <b>()</b>
       end of touch frame event Indicates the end of a set of events that logically belong together. A client is
       expected to accumulate the data in all events within the frame before proceeding.

       A wl_touch.frame terminates at least one event but otherwise no guarantee is provided about  the  set  of
       events  within  a frame. A client must assume that any state not updated in a frame is unchanged from the
       previously known state.

       Definition at line <b>3264</b> of file <b>wayland-client-protocol.cpp</b>.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(uint32_t,</b> <b>int32_t,</b> <b>double,</b> <b>double)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>touch_t::on_motion</b> <b>()</b>
       update of touch point coordinates

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>time</u> timestamp with millisecond granularity
           <u>id</u> the unique ID of this touch point
           <u>x</u> surface-local x coordinate
           <u>y</u> surface-local y coordinate

       A touch point has changed coordinates.

       Definition at line <b>3259</b> of file <b>wayland-client-protocol.cpp</b>.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(int32_t,</b> <b>double)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>touch_t::on_orientation</b> <b>()</b>
       update orientation of touch point

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>id</u> the unique ID of this touch point
           <u>orientation</u> angle between major axis and positive surface y-axis in degrees

       Sent when a touchpoint has changed its orientation.

       This event does not occur on its own. It is sent before a wl_touch.frame event and carries the new  shape
       information for any previously reported, or new touch points of that frame.

       Other  events  describing the touch point such as wl_touch.down, wl_touch.motion or wl_touch.shape may be
       sent within the same wl_touch.frame. A client should treat these events as a single logical  touch  point
       update.  The  order  of  wl_touch.shape,  wl_touch.orientation  and  wl_touch.motion is not guaranteed. A
       wl_touch.down event is guaranteed to occur before the first wl_touch.orientation event for this touch  ID
       but both events may occur within the same wl_touch.frame.

       The orientation describes the clockwise angle of a touchpoint's major axis to the positive surface y-axis
       and  is  normalized to the -180 to +180 degree range. The granularity of orientation depends on the touch
       device, some devices only support binary rotation values between 0 and 90 degrees.

       This event is only sent by the compositor if the touch device supports orientation reports.

       Definition at line <b>3279</b> of file <b>wayland-client-protocol.cpp</b>.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(int32_t,</b> <b>double,</b> <b>double)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>touch_t::on_shape</b> <b>()</b>
       update shape of touch point

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>id</u> the unique ID of this touch point
           <u>major</u> length of the major axis in surface-local coordinates
           <u>minor</u> length of the minor axis in surface-local coordinates

       Sent when a touchpoint has changed its shape.

       This event does not occur on its own. It is sent before a wl_touch.frame event and carries the new  shape
       information for any previously reported, or new touch points of that frame.

       Other  events  describing  the touch point such as wl_touch.down, wl_touch.motion or wl_touch.orientation
       may be sent within the same wl_touch.frame. A client should treat these events as a single logical  touch
       point  update. The order of wl_touch.shape, wl_touch.orientation and wl_touch.motion is not guaranteed. A
       wl_touch.down event is guaranteed to occur before the first wl_touch.shape event for this  touch  ID  but
       both events may occur within the same wl_touch.frame.

       A  touchpoint shape is approximated by an ellipse through the major and minor axis length. The major axis
       length describes the longer diameter of the ellipse, while the minor axis length  describes  the  shorter
       diameter.  Major and minor are orthogonal and both are specified in surface-local coordinates. The center
       of the ellipse is always at the touchpoint location as reported by wl_touch.down or wl_touch.move.

       This event is only sent by the compositor if the touch device supports shape reports. The client  has  to
       make reasonable assumptions about the shape if it did not receive this event.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(uint32_t,</b> <b>uint32_t,</b> <b>int32_t)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>touch_t::on_up</b> <b>()</b>
       end of a touch event sequence

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>serial</u> serial number of the touch up event
           <u>time</u> timestamp with millisecond granularity
           <u>id</u> the unique ID of this touch point

       The  touch  point  has  disappeared.  No  further  events will be sent for this touch point and the touch
       point's ID is released and may be reused in a future touch down event.
