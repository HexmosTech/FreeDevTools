       TclZipfs_AppHook,  TclZipfs_Mount,  TclZipfs_MountBuffer,  TclZipfs_Unmount  -  handle  ZIP  files as Tcl
       virtual filesystems

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       const char *
       <b>TclZipfs_AppHook</b>(<u>argcPtr,</u> <u>argvPtr</u>)

       int
       <b>TclZipfs_Mount</b>(<u>interp,</u> <u>zipname,</u> <u>mountpoint,</u> <u>password</u>)

       int
       <b>TclZipfs_MountBuffer</b>(<u>interp,</u> <u>data,</u> <u>dataLen,</u> <u>mountpoint,</u> <u>copy</u>)

       int
       <b>TclZipfs_Unmount</b>(<u>interp,</u> <u>mountpoint</u>)

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       int <u>*argcPtr</u> (in)                    Pointer to a variable holding the number of command  line  arguments
                                            from <b>main</b>().

       char <u>***argvPtr</u> (in)                 Pointer to an array of strings containing the command line arguments
                                            to <b>main</b>().

       Tcl_Interp <u>*interp</u> (in)              Interpreter   in   which  the  ZIP  file  system  is  mounted.   The
                                            interpreter's result is modified to hold the result or error message
                                            from the script.

       const char <u>*zipname</u> (in)             Name of a ZIP file.  Must  not  be  NULL  when  either  mounting  or
                                            unmounting a ZIP.

       const char <u>*mountpoint</u> (in)          Name  of  a mount point, which must be a legal Tcl file or directory
                                            name. May be NULL to query current mount points.

       const char <u>*password</u> (in)            An (optional) password. Use NULL if no password is  wanted  to  read
                                            the file.

       const void <u>*data</u> (in)                A  data buffer to mount. The data buffer must hold the contents of a
                                            ZIP archive, and must not be NULL.

       size_t <u>dataLen</u> (in)                  The number of bytes in the supplied data buffer argument, <u>data</u>.

       int <u>copy</u> (in)                        If non-zero, the ZIP archive in the data buffer will  be  internally
                                            copied before mounting, allowing the data buffer to be disposed once
                                            <b>TclZipfs_MountBuffer</b>  returns.  If  zero, the caller guarantees that
                                            the buffer will be valid to read from for the duration of the mount.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>TclZipfs_AppHook</b> is a utility function to perform standard application initialization procedures,  taking
       into account available ZIP archives as follows:

       [1]    If  the  current  application  has  a  mountable  ZIP  archive,  that  archive  is  mounted  under
              <u>ZIPFS_VOLUME</u><b><a href="file:/app">/app</a></b> as a read-only Tcl virtual file system (VFS). The value of  <u>ZIPFS_VOLUME</u>  can  be
              retrieved using the Tcl command <b>zipfs</b> <b>root</b>.

       [2]    If  a  file  named  <b>main.tcl</b>  is  located  in  the  root  directory  of that file system (i.e., at
              <u>ZIPFS_VOLUME</u><b>/app/main.tcl</b> after the ZIP archive is mounted as described above) it  is  treated  as
              the startup script for the process.

       [3]    If  the  file <u>ZIPFS_VOLUME</u><b>/app/tcl_library/init.tcl</b> is present, the <b>tcl_library</b> global variable in
              the initial Tcl interpreter is set to <u>ZIPFS_VOLUME</u><b>/app/tcl_library</b>.

       [4]    If the directory <b>tcl_library</b> was not found in the main application mount,  the  system  will  then
              search  for  it  as  either a VFS attached to the application dynamic library, or as a zip archive
              named <b>libtcl_</b><u>major_minor_patchlevel</u><b>.zip</b> either in the present working directory or in the standard
              Tcl install location. (For example, the Tcl  9.0.2  release  would  be  searched  for  in  a  file
              <b>libtcl_9_0_2.zip</b>.) That archive, if located, is also mounted read-only.

       On  Windows, <b>TclZipfs_AppHook</b> has a slightly different signature, since it uses WCHAR instead of char. As
       a result, it requires the application to be compiled with the UNICODE preprocessor symbol defined  (e.g.,
       via the <b>-DUNICODE</b> compiler flag).

       The   result   of   <b>TclZipfs_AppHook</b>   is   the   full   Tcl   version   with  build  information  (e.g.,
       <b>9.0.0+abcdef...abcdef.gcc-1002</b>).  The function <u>may</u> modify the variables pointed to by <u>argcPtr</u> and <u>argvPtr</u>
       to remove arguments; the current implementation does not do so, but callers <u>should</u> <u>not</u> assume  that  this
       will be true in the future.

       <b>TclZipfs_Mount</b>  is  used  to  mount  ZIP  archives  and  to  retrieve information about currently mounted
       archives. If <u>mountpoint</u> and <u>zipname</u> are both specified (i.e.  non-NULL),  the  function  mounts  the  ZIP
       archive  <u>zipname</u>  on the mount point given in <u>mountpoint</u>. If <u>password</u> is not NULL, it should point to the
       NUL terminated password protecting the archive. If not under the zipfs file system  root,  <u>mountpoint</u>  is
       normalized with respect to it.  For example, a mount point passed as either <b>mt</b> or <b>/mt</b> would be normalized
       to  <b>//zipfs:/mt</b>, given that <u>ZIPFS_VOLUME</u> as returned by <b>zipfs</b> <b>root</b> is “//zipfs:/”.  An error is raised if
       the mount point includes a drive or UNC volume. On success, <u>interp</u>'s result  is  set  to  the  normalized
       mount point path.

       If  <u>mountpoint</u>  is  a  NULL  pointer,  information on all currently mounted ZIP file systems is stored in
       <u>interp</u>'s result as a sequence of mount points and ZIP file names.

       If <u>mountpoint</u> is not NULL but <u>zipfile</u> is NULL, the path to the archive mounted at  that  mount  point  is
       stored as <u>interp</u>'s result. The function returns a standard Tcl result code.

       <b>TclZipfs_MountBuffer</b>  mounts  the  ZIP  archive content <u>data</u> on the mount point given in <u>mountpoint</u>. Both
       <u>mountpoint</u> and <u>data</u> must be specified as non-NULL. The <u>copy</u> argument determines  whether  the  buffer  is
       internally  copied  before  mounting  or not. The ZIP archive is assumed to be not password protected. On
       success, <u>interp</u>'s result is set to the normalized mount point path.

       <b>TclZipfs_Unmount</b> undoes the effect of <b>TclZipfs_Mount</b>, i.e., it unmounts the mounted ZIP file system  that
       was  mounted  from <u>zipname</u> (at <u>mountpoint</u>). Errors are reported in the interpreter <u>interp</u>.  The result of
       this call is a standard Tcl result code.

       <b>TclZipfs_AppHook</b> can not be used in stub-enabled extensions.
