       ping_iterator_get_info - Receive information about a host

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         #include &lt;oping.h&gt;

         int ping_iterator_get_info (pingobj_iter_t *iter,
                         int info,
                         void *buffer,
                         size_t *buffer_len);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ping_iterator_get_info</b> method can be used on an host iterator to return various information about the
       current host.

       The <u>iter</u> argument is an iterator as returned by <b><a href="../man3/ping_iterator_get.3.html">ping_iterator_get</a></b>(3) or <b><a href="../man3/ping_iterator_next.3.html">ping_iterator_next</a></b>(3).

       The <u>info</u> argument specifies the type of information returned. Use the following defines:

       <b>PING_INFO_USERNAME</b>
           Return the hostname of the host the iterator points to as supplied by the user.  This is the name you
           passed to <b><a href="../man3/ping_host_add.3.html">ping_host_add</a></b>(3) and which you need to pass to "ping_host_remove", too.

       <b>PING_INFO_HOSTNAME</b>
           Return  the hostname of the host the iterator points to. Since the name is looked up using the socket
           address this may differ from the hostname passed to <b><a href="../man3/ping_host_add.3.html">ping_host_add</a></b>(3). The hostname is actually looked
           up every time you call this method, no cache is involved within <u>liboping</u>.

           It is recommended to include "netdb.h" and allocate <b>NI_MAXHOST</b> bytes of buffer.

       <b>PING_INFO_ADDRESS</b>
           Return the address used in ASCII (i.e. human readable) format. The address is looked  up  every  time
           you  call  this  method. 40 bytes should be sufficient for the buffer (16 octets in hex format, seven
           colons and one null byte), but more won't hurt.

       <b>PING_INFO_FAMILY</b>
           Returns the address family of the host. The buffer should be big enough to hold an integer. The value
           is either <b>AF_INET</b> or <b>AF_INET6</b>.

       <b>PING_INFO_LATENCY</b>
           Return the last measured latency or less than zero if the timeout occurred before a echo response was
           received. The buffer should be big enough to hold a double value.

       <b>PING_INFO_DROPPED</b>
           Return the number of times that no response was received within the  timeout.   This  value  is  only
           increased  but  may  wrap  around  at the 32 bit boundary.  The buffer should be big enough to hold a
           32 bit integer, e. g. an "uint32_t".

       <b>PING_INFO_SEQUENCE</b>
           Return the last sequence number sent. This number is increased regardless  of  echo  responses  being
           received or not. The buffer should hold an integer.

       <b>PING_INFO_IDENT</b>
           Return the ident that is put into every ICMP packet sent to this host. Per convention this usually is
           the  PID  of  the  sending process, but since <u>liboping</u> can handle several hosts in parallel it uses a
           (pseudo-)random number here. The buffer should be big enough to hold an integer value.

       <b>PING_INFO_RECV_TTL</b>
           Returns the <u>time</u> <u>to</u> <u>live</u> (TTL) of the received network packets. This number depends on the value that
           was used by the remote host when it sent the echo reply and has nothing to do with  the  <b>PING_OPT_TTL</b>
           of <b><a href="../man3/ping_setopt.3.html">ping_setopt</a></b>(3). The buffer should be big enough to hold an integer value.

       <b>PING_INFO_RECV_QOS</b>
           Returns the value of the <u>Quality</u> <u>of</u> <u>Service</u> (QoS) byte of the incoming IPv4 or IPv6 packet. This byte
           is  not  interpreted  by  <u>liboping</u> at all and may be DSCP / ECN or precedence / ToS depending on your
           network setup.  Please see the appropriate RFCs for further information on values you can  expect  to
           receive. The buffer is expected to an "uint8_t".

       The  <u>buffer</u>  argument  is a pointer to an appropriately sized area of memory where the result of the call
       will be stored. The <u>buffer_len</u> value is used as input and output: When calling <b>ping_iterator_get_info</b>  it
       reports  the  size  of  the memory region pointed to by <u>buffer</u>. The method will write the number of bytes
       actually written to the memory into <u>buffer_len</u> before returning.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ping_iterator_get_info</b> returns zero if it succeeds.

       <b>EINVAL</b> is returned if the value passed as <u>info</u> is unknown. Both, <u>buffer</u>  and  <u>buffer_len</u>,  will  be  left
       untouched in this case.

       If  the requested information didn't fit into <u>buffer</u> then the size that would have been needed is written
       into <u>buffer_len</u>; <u>buffer</u> itself is left untouched. The return value is <b>ENOMEM</b> in this case.
