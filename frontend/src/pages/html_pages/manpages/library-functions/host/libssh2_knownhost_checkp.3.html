</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       libssh2_knownhost_checkp - check a host+key against the list of known hosts

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;libssh2.h&gt;

       int
       libssh2_knownhost_checkp(LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOSTS *hosts,
                                const char *host, int port,
                                const char *key, size_t keylen,
                                int typemask,
                                struct libssh2_knownhost **knownhost);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Checks  a  host and its associated key against the collection of known hosts, and returns info back about
       the (partially) matched entry.

       <u>host</u> is a pointer the host name in plain text. The host name can be the IP numerical address of the  host
       or the full name.

       <u>port</u>  is  the  port number used by the host (or a negative number to check the generic host). If the port
       number is given, libssh2 will check the key for the specific host + port number combination  in  addition
       to the plain host name only check.

       <u>key</u> is a pointer to the key for the given host.

       <u>keylen</u> is the total size in bytes of the key pointed to by the <u>key</u> argument

       <u>typemask</u>  is  a  bitmask  that  specifies  format  and  info  about  the  data  passed  to this function.
       Specifically, it details what format the host name is, what format the key is and what key type it is.

       The  host  name  is  given   as   one   of   the   following   types:   LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_TYPE_PLAIN   or
       LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_TYPE_CUSTOM.

       The   key   is   encoded   using   one   of  the  following  encodings:  LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_KEYENC_RAW  or
       LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_KEYENC_BASE64.

       <u>knownhost</u> if set to non-NULL, it must be a pointer to a  'struct  libssh2_knownhost'  pointer  that  gets
       filled in to point to info about a known host that matches or partially matches.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man3/libssh2_knownhost_check.3.html">libssh2_knownhost_check</a>(3)</u>  returns  info  about how well the provided host + key pair matched one of the
       entries in the list of known hosts.

       LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_FAILURE - something prevented the check to be made

       LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_NOTFOUND - no host match was found

       LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_MATCH - hosts and keys match.

       LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_MISMATCH - host was found, but the keys did not match!

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Added in libssh2 1.2.6

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       See the ssh2_exec.c example as provided in the tarball.
