</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       libssh2_knownhost_addc - add a known host

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;libssh2.h&gt;

       int
       libssh2_knownhost_addc(LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOSTS *hosts,
                              char *host, char *salt,
                              char *key, size_t keylen,
                              const char *comment, size_t commentlen,
                              int typemask,
                              struct libssh2_knownhost **store);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Adds a known host to the collection of known hosts identified by the 'hosts' handle.

       <u>host</u>  is  a pointer the host name in plain text or hashed. If hashed, it must be provided base64 encoded.
       The host name can be the IP numerical address of the host or the full name.

       If you want to add a key for a specific port number for the given host, you must provide  the  host  name
       like  '[host]:port' with the actual characters '[' and ']' enclosing the host name and a colon separating
       the host part from the port number. For example: "[host.example.com]:222".

       <u>salt</u> is a pointer to the salt used for the host hashing, if the host is provided hashed. If the  host  is
       provided  in plain text, salt has no meaning.  The salt has to be provided base64 encoded with a trailing
       zero byte.

       <u>key</u> is a pointer to the key for the given host.

       <u>keylen</u> is the total size in bytes of the key pointed to by the <u>key</u> argument

       <u>comment</u> is a pointer to a comment for the key.

       <u>commentlen</u> is the total size in bytes of the comment pointed to by the <u>comment</u> argument

       <u>typemask</u> is a  bitmask  that  specifies  format  and  info  about  the  data  passed  to  this  function.
       Specifically, it details what format the host name is, what format the key is and what key type it is.

       The   host   name   is   given   as   one   of   the   following   types:   LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_TYPE_PLAIN,
       LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_TYPE_SHA1 or LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_TYPE_CUSTOM.

       The  key  is  encoded  using  one   of   the   following   encodings:   LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_KEYENC_RAW   or
       LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_KEYENC_BASE64.

       The  key  is  using  one of these algorithms: LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_KEY_RSA1, LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_KEY_SSHRSA or
       LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_KEY_SSHDSS (deprecated).

       <u>store</u> should point to a pointer that gets filled in to point to the known host data after  the  addition.
       NULL can be passed if you do not care about this pointer.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns a regular libssh2 error code, where negative values are error codes and 0 indicates success.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Added in libssh2 1.2.5
