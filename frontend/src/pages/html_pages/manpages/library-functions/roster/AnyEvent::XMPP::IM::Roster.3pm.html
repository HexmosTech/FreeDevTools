       AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Roster - Instant messaging roster for XMPP

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          my $con = AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Connection-&gt;new (...);
          ...
          my $ro  = $con-&gt;roster;
          if (my $c = $ro-&gt;get_contact ('<a href="mailto:test@example.com">test@example.com</a>')) {
             $c-&gt;make_message ()-&gt;add_body ("Hello there!")-&gt;send;
          }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module represents a class for roster objects which contain contact information.

       It manages the roster of a JID connected by an AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Connection.  It manages also the
       presence information that is received.

       You get the roster by calling the "roster" method on an AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Connection object. There is
       no other way.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>is_retrieved</b>
           Returns true if this roster was fetched from the server or false if this roster hasn't been retrieved
           yet.

       <b>new_contact</b> <b>($jid,</b> <b>$name,</b> <b>$groups,</b> <b>$cb)</b>
           This  method  sends  a  roster  item  creation request to the server. $jid is the JID of the contact.
           $name is the nickname of the contact, which can  be  undef.  $groups  should  be  a  array  reference
           containing the groups this contact should be in.

           The  callback  in  $cb  will  be called when the creation is finished. The first argument will be the
           "AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Contact"  object  if  no  error  occured.  The  second  argument  will   be   an
           AnyEvent::XMPP::Error::IQ object if the request resulted in an error.

           Please  note  that  the  contact  you  are  given  in  that  callback  might not yet be on the roster
           ("is_on_roster" still returns a false value), if the server did send the roster  push  after  the  iq
           result of the roster set, so don't rely on the fact that the contact is on the roster.

       <b>delete_contact</b> <b>($jid,</b> <b>$cb)</b>
           This  method will send a request to the server to delete this contact from the roster. It will result
           in cancelling all subscriptions.

           $cb will be called when the request was finished. The first argument  to  the  callback  might  be  a
           AnyEvent::XMPP::Error::IQ object if the request resulted in an error.

       <b>get_contact</b> <b>($jid)</b>
           Returns  the contact on the roster with the JID $jid.  (If $jid is not bare the resource part will be
           stripped before searching)

           <b>NOTE:</b> This method will also return contacts that we have only presence for. To be sure the contact is
           on the users roster you need to call the "is_on_roster" method on the contact.

           The return value is an instance of AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Contact.

       <b>get_contacts</b>
           Returns the contacts that are on this roster as AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Contact objects.

           NOTE: This method only returns the contacts that have a roster item. If  you  haven't  retrieved  the
           roster yet the presence information is still stored but you have to get the contacts without a roster
           item with the "get_contacts_off_roster" method. See below.

       <b>get_contacts_off_roster</b>
           Returns  the  contacts  that  are  not on the roster but for which we have received presence.  Return
           value is a list of AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Contact objects.

           See also documentation of "get_contacts" method of AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Roster above.

       <b>get_own_contact</b>
           This method returns a AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Contact object which stands for ourself. It will be used to
           keep track of our own presences.

       <b>debug_dump</b>
           This prints the roster and all it's contacts and their presences.
