</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SOAP::WSDL - SOAP with WSDL support

</pre><h4><b>NOTICE</b></h4><pre>
       This module is <b>not</b> recommended for new application development.  Please use XML::Compile::SOAP or
       SOAP::Lite instead if possible.

       This module has a large number of known bugs and is not being actively developed.  This 3.0 release is
       intended to update the module to pass tests on newer Perls.  This is a service to existing applications
       already dependent on this module.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        my $soap = SOAP::WSDL-&gt;new(
           wsdl =&gt; 'file://bla.wsdl',
        );

        my $result = $soap-&gt;call('MyMethod', %data);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For creating Perl classes instrumenting a web service with a WSDL definition, read SOAP::WSDL::Manual.

       For using an interpreting (thus slow and somewhat troublesome) WSDL based SOAP client, which mimics
       SOAP::Lite's API, read on.

       Creating Interface classes is the recommended usage.

       Did I say you should create interface classes following the steps in SOAP::WSDL::Manual?

       If you're migrating from earlier versions of SOAP::WSDL, you should read the MIGRATING documentation.

       The stuff below is for users of the 1.2x SOAP::WSDL series. All others, please refer to
       SOAP::WSDL::Manual

       SOAP::WSDL provides easy access to Web Services with WSDL descriptions.

       The WSDL is parsed and stored in memory.

       Your data is serialized according to the rules in the WSDL.

       The only transport mechanisms currently supported are http and https.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       Constructor. All parameters passed are passed to the corresponding methods.

   <b>call</b>
       Performs a SOAP call. The result is either an object tree (with outputtree), a hash reference (with
       outputhash), plain XML (with outputxml) or a SOAP::SOM object (with neither of the above set).

       <b>call()</b> can be called in different ways:

       •   Old-style idiom

            my $result = $soap-&gt;call('method', %data);

           Does not support SOAP header data.

       •   New-style idiom

            my $result = $soap-&gt;call('method', $body_ref, $header_ref );

           Does   support   SOAP   header   data.  $body_ref  and  $header  ref  may  either  be  hash  refs  or
           SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::* derived objects.

           Result headers are accessible via the result SOAP::SOM object.

           If outputtree or outputhash are set, you may also use the following to access response header data:

            my ($body, $header) = $soap-&gt;call('method', $body_ref, $header_ref );

   <b>wsdlinit</b>
       Reads the WSDL file and initializes SOAP::WSDL for working with it.

       Is called automatically from <b>call()</b> if not called directly before.

        servicename
        portname
        call

       You may set servicename and portname by passing them as attributes to wsdlinit:

        $soap-&gt;wsdlinit(
           servicename =&gt; 'MyService',
           portname =&gt; 'MyPort',
        );

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>outputtree</b>
       When outputtree is set, SOAP::WSDL will return an object tree instead of a SOAP::SOM object.

       You have to specify a class_resolver for this to work. See class_resolver

   <b>class_resolver</b>
       Set the class resolver class (or object).

       Class resolvers must implement the method get_class which has to return the name of the  class  name  for
       deserializing a XML node at the current XPath location.

       Class  resolvers  are typically generated by using the generate_typemap method of a SOAP::WSDL::Generator
       subclass.

       Example:

       XML structure (SOAP body content):

        &lt;Person&gt;
           &lt;Name&gt;Smith&lt;/Name&gt;
           &lt;FirstName&gt;John&lt;/FirstName&gt;
        &lt;/Person&gt;

       Class resolver

        package MyResolver;
        my %typemap = (
           'Person' =&gt; 'MyPersonClass',
           'Person/Name' =&gt; 'SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Builtin::string',
           'Person/FirstName' =&gt; 'SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Builtin::string',
        );

        sub get_class { return $typemap{ $_[1] } };
        1;

       You'll   need   a   MyPersonClass   module   in   your   search   path   for   this   to   work   -   see
       SOAP::WSDL::XSD::ComplexType on how to build / generate one.

   <b>servicename</b>
        $soap-&gt;servicename('Name');

       Sets the service to operate on. If no service is set via servicename, the first service found is used.

       Returns the soap object, so you can chain calls like

        $soap-&gt;servicename-&gt;('Name')-&gt;portname('Port');

   <b>portname</b>
        $soap-&gt;portname('Name');

       Sets the port to operate on. If no port is set via portname, the first port found is used.

       Returns the soap object, so you can chain calls like

        $soap-&gt;portname('Port')-&gt;call('MyMethod', %data);

   <b>no_dispatch</b>
       When  set, <b>call()</b> returns the plain request XML instead of dispatching the SOAP call to the SOAP service.
       Handy for testing/debugging.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>SOAP::WSDL's</b> <b>internals</b></h4><pre>
   <b>get_client</b> <b>/</b> <b>set_client</b>
       Returns the SOAP client implementation used (normally a SOAP::WSDL::Client object).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       See the examples/ directory.

</pre><h4><b>Differences</b> <b>to</b> <b>previous</b> <b>versions</b></h4><pre>
       •   WSDL handling

           SOAP::WSDL 2 is a complete rewrite. While SOAP::WSDL 1.x attempted to process the WSDL  file  on  the
           fly  by  using XPath queries, SOAP:WSDL 2 uses a Expat handler for parsing the WSDL and building up a
           object tree representing it's content.

           The object tree has two main functions: It knows how to serialize data passed as hash ref, and how to
           render the WSDL elements found into perl classes.

           Yup you're right; there's a builtin code generation facility. Read SOAP::WSDL::Manual for using it.

       •   no_dispatch

           <b>call()</b> with no_dispatch set to true now returns the complete SOAP  request  envelope,  not  only  the
           body's content.

       •   outputxml

           <b>call()</b>  with  outputxml  set  to  true  now returns the complete SOAP response envelope, not only the
           body's content.

       •   servicename/portname

           Both servicename and portname can only be called <b>after</b> calling <b>wsdlinit()</b>.

           You may pass the servicename and portname as attributes to wsdlinit, though.

</pre><h4><b>Differences</b> <b>to</b> <b>previous</b> <b>versions</b></h4><pre>
       The following functionality is no longer supported:

   <b>Operation</b> <b>overloading</b>
       The SOAP standard allows operation overloading - that is, you may specify SOAP operations with more  than
       one  message.  The client/server than can choose which message to send. This SOAP feature is usually used
       similar to the use of methods with different argument lists in C++.

       Operation overloading is no longer supported. The WS-I Basic profile does not operation overloading.  The
       same  functionality  as  operation  overloading  can be obtained by using a choice declaration in the XML
       Schema.

   <b>readable</b>
       Readable has no effect any more. If you need readable  debug  output,  copy  the  SOAP  message  to  your
       favorite  XML  editor  and  run  the  source  format  command.   Outputting readable XML requires lots of
       programming for little use: The resulting XMl is still quite unreadable.

   <b>on_action</b>
       Setting on_action is not required any more, the appropriate value is automatically taken from  the  WSDL.
       on_action is a no-op, and is just here for compatibility issues.

</pre><h4><b>Differences</b> <b>to</b> <b>SOAP::Lite</b></h4><pre>
   <b>readable</b>
       readable  is  a  no-op in SOAP::WSDL. Actually, the XML output from SOAP::Lite is hardly readable, either
       with readable switched on.

       If you need readable XML  messages,  I  suggest  using  your  favorite  XML  editor  for  displaying  and
       formatting.

   <b>Message</b> <b>style/encoding</b>
       While SOAP::Lite supports rpc/encoded style/encoding only, SOAP::WSDL currently supports document/literal
       style/encoding.

   <b>autotype</b> <b>/</b> <b>type</b> <b>information</b>
       SOAP::Lite defaults to transmitting XML type information by default, where SOAP::WSDL defaults to leaving
       it out.

       <b><a href="../man1/autotype.1.html">autotype</a></b>(1) might even be broken in SOAP::WSDL - it's not well-tested, yet.

   <b>Output</b> <b>formats</b>
       In contrast to SOAP::Lite, SOAP::WSDL supports the following output formats:

       •   SOAP::SOM objects.

           This is the default. SOAP::Lite is required for outputting SOAP::SOM objects.

       •   Object trees.

           This  is  the  recommended  output format.  You need a class resolver (typemap) for outputting object
           trees.  See class_resolver above.

       •   Hash refs

           This is for convenience: A single hash ref containing the content of the SOAP body.

       •   xml

           See below.

   <b>outputxml</b>
       SOAP::Lite returns only the content of the SOAP body when outputxml is set to  true.  SOAP::WSDL  returns
       the complete XML response.

   <b>Auto-Dispatching</b>
       SOAP::WSDL does <b>does</b> <b>not</b> support auto-dispatching.

       This  is on purpose: You may easily create interface classes by using SOAP::WSDL::Client and implementing
       something like

        sub mySoapMethod {
            my $self = shift;
            $soap_wsdl_client-&gt;call( mySoapMethod, @_);
        }

       You may even do this in a class factory - see wsdl2perl for creating such interfaces.

   <b>Debugging</b> <b>/</b> <b>Tracing</b>
       While SOAP::Lite features a global tracing facility, SOAP::WSDL allows one to switch tracing on/of  on  a
       per-object base.

       This  has  to  be  done  in  the  SOAP  client  used  by  SOAP::WSDL  - see get_client for an example and
       SOAP::WSDL::Client for details.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The bug tracker is at &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=SOAP-WSDL&gt;.

       This module is in legacy maintenance mode.  Only show stopper bugs are being fixed, until/unless  someone
       wishes  to  resume  active development on it.  Scott Walters, "<a href="mailto:scott@slowass.net">scott@slowass.net</a>" has obtained co-mainter
       from the CPAN admins for the purpose of applying existing fixes people have submit to the RT tracker, and
       to apply other fixes as needed to get the module to install and run on  newer  Perls.   Non  show-stopper
       bugs  reports  without  fixes  will be added to this list of limitations.  Of course, fixes for these and
       other bugs are welcome.  Scott does not get email from rt.cpan.org, so please drop an  email  to  him  at
       "<a href="mailto:scott@slowass.net">scott@slowass.net</a>" if you open a ticket there.

       •   Breaks the idiom "$package-&gt;can("SUPER::method")" in your code

           If  you  redefine "UNIVERSAL::can()", and someone tries to do "$package-&gt;can("SUPER::method")", it'll
           look at your packages @ISA, not theirs.  This module does precicely that, by way of its dependency on
           "Class::Std::Fast".

       •   $obj == undef does not work in perl 5.8.6 and perl 5.8.7

           Due to some strange behaviour in perl 5.8.6  and  perl  5.8.7,  stringification  overloading  is  not
           triggered during comparison with undef.

           While this is probably harmless in most cases, it's important to know that you need to do

            defined( $obj-&gt;get_value() )

           to check for undef values in simpleType objects.

       •   perl 5.8.0 or higher required

           SOAP::WSDL   needs   perl   5.8.0   or  higher.  This  is  due  to  a  bug  in  perls  before  -  see
           <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl5-porters/929746">http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl5-porters/929746</a> for details.

       •   Apache SOAP datatypes are not supported

           You can't use SOAP::WSDL with Apache SOAP datatypes like map.

       •   Incomplete XML Schema definitions support

           This section describes the limitations of SOAP::WSDL, that  is  the  interpreting  SOAP  client.  For
           limitations of wsdl2perl generated SOAP clients, see SOAP::WSDL::Manual::XSD.

           XML Schema attribute definitions are not supported in interpreting mode.

           The following XML Schema definitions varieties are not supported in interpreting mod:

            group
            simpleContent

           The following XML Schema definition content model is only partially supported in interpreting mode:

            complexContent - only restriction variety supported

           See SOAP::WSDL::Manual::XSD for details.

       •   Serialization of hash refs does not work for ambiguous values

           If  you  have list elements with multiple occurrences allowed, SOAP::WSDL has no means of finding out
           which variant you meant.

           Passing in item =&gt; [1,2,3] could serialize to

            &lt;item&gt;1 2&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;3&lt;/item&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;1&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;2 3&lt;/item&gt;

           Ambiguous data can be avoided by providing data as objects.

       •   XML Schema facets

           Almost no XML schema facets are implemented. The only facets currently implemented are:

            fixed
            default

           The following facets have no influence:

            minLength
            maxLength
            minInclusive
            maxInclusive
            minExclusive
            maxExclusive
            pattern
            enumeration

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Related</b> <b>projects</b>
       •   SOAP::Lite

           Full featured SOAP-library, little WSDL support. Supports  rpc-encoded  style  only.  Many  protocols
           supported.

       •   XML::Compile::SOAP

           Creates   parser/generator   functions   for   SOAP   messages.   Includes  SOAP  Client  and  Server
           implementations. Can validate XML messages.

           You might want to give it a try, especially if you need to adhere very closely to the  XML  Schema  /
           WSDL specs.

       JT Justman and Noah Robin provided early feedback and bug reports for the 2.xx pre-releases.

       Adam Kennedy checked and suggested improvements on metadata and dependencies in the 2.xx pre-releases.

       Andreas 'ac0v' Specht constantly asked for better performance.

       Matt S. Trout encouraged me "to get a non-dev-release out."

       CPAN Testers provided most valuable (automated) feedback. Thanks a lot.

       Numerous people sent me their real-world WSDL files and error reports for testing. Thank you.

       Noah  Robin  contributed  lots  of  documentation  fixes,  and the mod_perl server, and eventually joined
       SOAP::WSDL's development. Thanks.

       Mark Overmeer wrote XML::Compile::SOAP - competition is good for business.

       Paul Kulchenko and Byrne Reese wrote and maintained SOAP::Lite and thus provided a base (and counterpart)
       for SOAP::WSDL.
