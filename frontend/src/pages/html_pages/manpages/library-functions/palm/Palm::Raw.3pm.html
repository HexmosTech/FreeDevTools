</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Palm::Raw - Handler for "raw" Palm databases

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 1.400 of Palm::Raw, released March 7, 2015 as part of Palm-PDB version
       1.400.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Palm::Raw;

       For standalone programs.

           use Palm::Raw();
           @ISA = qw( Palm::Raw );

       For Palm::PDB helper modules.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Raw PDB handler is a helper class for the Palm::PDB package. It is intended as a generic handler for
       any database, or as a fallback default handler.

       If you have a standalone program and want it to be able to parse any type of database, use

           use Palm::Raw;

       If you are using Palm::Raw as a parent class for your own database handler, use

           use Palm::Raw();

       If you omit the parentheses, Palm::Raw will register itself as the default handler for all databases,
       which is probably not what you want.

       The Raw handler does no processing on the database whatsoever. The AppInfo block, sort block, records and
       resources are simply strings, raw data from the database.

       By default, the Raw handler only handles record databases (.pdb files). If you want it to handle resource
       databases (.prc files) as well, you need to call

           &amp;Palm::PDB::RegisterPRCHandlers("Palm::Raw", "");

       in your script.

   <b>AppInfo</b> <b>block</b>
           $pdb-&gt;{appinfo}

       This is a scalar, the raw data of the AppInfo block.

   <b>Sort</b> <b>block</b>
           $pdb-&gt;{sort}

       This is a scalar, the raw data of the sort block.

   <b>Records</b>
           @{$pdb-&gt;{records}Z&lt;&gt;};

       Each element in the "records" array is a reference-to-hash. In addition to the standard keys
       ("attributes", "category", and "id"), this hash contains the key "data"; its value is a string with the
       raw record data.

   <b>Resources</b>
           @{$pdb-&gt;{resources}Z&lt;&gt;};

       Each element in the "resources" array is a reference-to-hash. In addition to the standard keys ("type"
       and "id"), it contains the key "data"; its value is a string with the raw resource data.
