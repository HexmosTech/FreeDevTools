</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Palm - Palm OS utility functions

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 1.400 of Palm, released March 14, 2015 as part of Palm version 1.400.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>palm2epoch</b>
               my @parts = localtime( palm2epoch($palmtime) );

       Converts a Palm OS timestamp to a Unix Epoch time. Note, however, that Palm OS time is in the timezone of
       the Palm itself while Epoch is defined to be in the GMT timezone. Further conversion may be necessary.

   <b>epoch2palm</b>
               my $palmtime = epoch2palm( time() );

       Converts Unix epoch time to Palm OS time.

   <b>mkpdbname</b>
               $PDB-&gt;Write( mkpdbname($PDB-&gt;{name}) );

       Convert a Palm OS database name to a 7-bit ASCII representation. Native Palm database names can be found
       in ISO-8859-1 encoding. This encoding isn't going to generate the most portable of filenames and, in
       particular, ColdSync databases use this representation.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Palm::PDB

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Palm requires no configuration files or environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       No bugs have been reported.
