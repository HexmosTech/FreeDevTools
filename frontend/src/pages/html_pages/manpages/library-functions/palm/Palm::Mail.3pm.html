</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Palm::Mail - Handler for Palm OS Mail databases

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 1.400 of Palm::Mail, released March 14, 2015 as part of Palm version
       1.400.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Palm::Mail;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Mail PDB handler is a helper class for the Palm::PDB package. It parses Mail databases.

   <b>AppInfo</b> <b>block</b>
       The AppInfo block begins with standard category support. See Palm::StdAppInfo for details.

       Other fields include:

           $pdb-&gt;{appinfo}{sortOrder}
           $pdb-&gt;{appinfo}{unsent}
           $pdb-&gt;{appinfo}{sigOffset}

       I don't know what these are.

   <b>Sort</b> <b>block</b>
           $pdb-&gt;{sort}

       This is a scalar, the raw data of the sort block.

   <b>Records</b>
           $record = $pdb-&gt;{records}[N]

           $record-&gt;{year}
           $record-&gt;{month}
           $record-&gt;{day}
           $record-&gt;{hour}
           $record-&gt;{minute}

       The message's timestamp.

           $record-&gt;{is_read}

       This is defined and true iff the message has been read.

           $record-&gt;{has_signature}

       For outgoing messages, this is defined and true iff the message should have a signature attached. The
       signature itself is stored in the "Saved Preferences.prc" database, and is of type "mail" with ID 2.

           $record-&gt;{confirm_read}

       If this is defined and true, then the sender requests notification when the message has been read.

           $record-&gt;{confirm_delivery}

       If this is defined and true, then the sender requests notification when the message has been delivered.

           $record-&gt;{priority}

       An integer in the range 0-2, for high, normal, or low priority, respectively.

           $record-&gt;{addressing}

       An integer in the range 0-2, indicating the addressing type: To, Cc, or Bcc respectively. I don't know
       what this means.

           $record-&gt;{subject}
           $record-&gt;{from}
           $record-&gt;{to}
           $record-&gt;{cc}
           $record-&gt;{bcc}
           $record-&gt;{replyTo}
           $record-&gt;{sentTo}

       Strings, the various header fields.

           $record-&gt;{body}

       A string, the body of the message.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         $pdb = new Palm::Mail;

       Create a new PDB, initialized with the various Palm::Mail fields and an empty record list.

       Use this method if you're creating a Mail PDB from scratch.

   <b>new_Record</b>
         $record = $pdb-&gt;new_Record;

       Creates a new Mail record, with blank values for all of the fields.

       "new_Record" does <b>not</b> add the new record to $pdb. For that, you want "$pdb-&gt;append_Record".

       Note: the time given by the "year", "month", "day", "hour", and "minute" fields in the new record are
       initialized to the time when the record was created. They should be reset to the time when the message
       was sent.
