</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Palm::ToDo - Handler for Palm ToDo databases

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 1.400 of Palm::ToDo, released March 14, 2015 as part of Palm version
       1.400.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Palm::ToDo;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The ToDo PDB handler is a helper class for the Palm::PDB package. It parses ToDo databases.

   <b>AppInfo</b> <b>block</b>
       The AppInfo block begins with standard category support. See Palm::StdAppInfo for details.

       Other fields include:

           $pdb-&gt;{appinfo}{dirty_appinfo}
           $pdb-&gt;{appinfo}{sortOrder}

       I don't know what these are.

   <b>Sort</b> <b>block</b>
           $pdb-&gt;{sort}

       This is a scalar, the raw data of the sort block.

   <b>Records</b>
           $record = $pdb-&gt;{records}[N]

           $record-&gt;{due_day}
           $record-&gt;{due_month}
           $record-&gt;{due_year}

       The due date of the ToDo item. If the item has no due date, these are undefined.

           $record-&gt;{completed}

       This is defined and true iff the item has been completed.

           $record-&gt;{priority}

       An integer. The priority of the item.

           $record-&gt;{description}

       A text string. The description of the item.

           $record-&gt;{note}

       A text string. The note attached to the item. Undefined if the item has no note.

   <b>new</b>
         $pdb = new Palm::ToDo;

       Create a new PDB, initialized with the various Palm::ToDo fields and an empty record list.

       Use this method if you're creating a ToDo PDB from scratch.

   <b>new_Record</b>
         $record = $pdb-&gt;new_Record;

       Creates a new ToDo record, with blank values for all of the fields.

       "new_Record" does <b>not</b> add the new record to $pdb. For that, you want "$pdb-&gt;append_Record".
