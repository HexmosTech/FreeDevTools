</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Getopt::Mixed - [OBSOLETE] getopt processing with both long and short options

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 1.12 of Getopt::Mixed, released February 8, 2014.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Getopt::Mixed;
           Getopt::Mixed::getOptions(...option-descriptions...);
           ...examine $opt_* variables...

       or

           use Getopt::Mixed "nextOption";
           Getopt::Mixed::init(...option-descriptions...);
           while (($option, $value) = nextOption()) {
               ...process option...
           }
           Getopt::Mixed::cleanup();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>This</b> <b>module</b> <b>is</b> <b>obsolete.</b>

       This package was my response to the standard modules Getopt::Std and Getopt::Long.  Std doesn't support
       long options, and Long didn't support short options.  I wanted both, since long options are easier to
       remember and short options are faster to type.

       However, years ago Getopt::Long was changed to support short options as well, and it has the huge
       advantage of being part of the standard Perl distribution.  So, Getopt::Mixed is now effectively
       obsolete.  I don't intend to make any more changes, but I'm leaving it available for people who have code
       that already uses it.  For new modules, I recommend using Getopt::Long like this:

           use Getopt::Long 2.17; # Released with Perl 5.005
           Getopt::Long::Configure(qw(bundling no_getopt_compat));
           GetOptions(...option-descriptions...);

       This package was intended to be the "Getopt-to-end-all-Getop's".  It combines (I hope) flexibility and
       simplicity.  It supports both short options (introduced by "-") and long options (introduced by "--").
       Short options which do not take an argument can be grouped together.  Short options which do take an
       argument must be the last option in their group, because everything following the option will be
       considered to be its argument.

       There are two methods for using Getopt::Mixed:  the simple method and the flexible method.  Both methods
       use the same format for option descriptions.

   <b>Option</b> <b>Descriptions</b>
       The option-description arguments required by "init" and "getOptions" are strings composed of individual
       option descriptions.  Several option descriptions can appear in the same string if they are separated by
       whitespace.

       Each description consists of the option name and an optional trailing argument specifier.  Option names
       may consist of any characters but whitespace, "=", ":", and "&gt;".

       Values for argument specifiers are:

         &lt;none&gt;   option does not take an argument
         =s :s    option takes a mandatory (=) or optional (:) string argument
         =i :i    option takes a mandatory (=) or optional (:) integer argument
         =f :f    option takes a mandatory (=) or optional (:) real number argument
         &gt;new     option is a synonym for option `new'

       The "&gt;" specifier is not really an argument specifier.  It defines an option as being a synonym for
       another option.  For example, "a=i apples&gt;a" would define <b>-a</b> as an option that requires an integer
       argument and <b>--apples</b> as a synonym for <b>-a</b>.  Only one level of synonyms is supported, and the root option
       must be listed first.  For example, "apples&gt;a a=i" and "a=i apples&gt;a oranges&gt;apples" are illegal; use
       "a=i apples&gt;a oranges&gt;a" if that's what you want.

       For example, in the option description:
            "a b=i c:s apple baker&gt;b charlie:s"
                -a and --apple do not take arguments
                -b takes a mandatory integer argument
                --baker is a synonym for -b
                -c and --charlie take an optional string argument

       If the first argument to "init" or "getOptions" is entirely non-alphanumeric characters with no
       whitespace, it represents the characters which can begin options.

   <b>User</b> <b>Interface</b>
       From the user's perspective, short options are introduced by a dash ("-") and long options are introduced
       by a double dash ("--").  Short options may be combined ("-a -b" can be written "-ab"), but an option
       that takes an argument must be the last one in its group, because anything following it is considered
       part of the argument.  A double dash by itself marks the end of the options; all arguments following it
       are treated as normal arguments, not options.  A single dash by itself is treated as a normal argument,
       <u>not</u> an option.

       Long options may be abbreviated.  An option <b>--all-the-time</b> could be abbreviated <b>--all</b>, <b>--a--tim</b>, or even
       <b>--a</b>.  Note that <b>--time</b> would not work; the abbreviation must start at the beginning of the option name.
       If an abbreviation is ambiguous, an error message will be printed.

       In the following examples, <b>-i</b> and <b>--int</b> take integer arguments, <b>-f</b> and <b>--float</b> take floating point
       arguments, and <b>-s</b> and <b>--string</b> take string arguments.  All other options do not take an argument.

         -i24            -f24.5               -sHello
         -i=24 --int=-27 -f=24.5 --float=0.27 -s=Hello --string=Hello

       If the argument is required, it can also be separated by whitespace:

         -i 24 --int -27 -f 24.5 --float 0.27 -s Hello --string Hello

       Note that if the option is followed by "=", whatever follows the "=" <u>is</u> the argument, even if it's the
       null string.  In the example

         -i= 24 -f= 24.5 -s= Hello

       <b>-i</b> and <b>-f</b> will cause an error, because the null string is not a number, but <b>-s</b> is perfectly legal; its
       argument is the null string, not "Hello".

       Remember that optional arguments <u>cannot</u> be separated from the option by whitespace.

   <b>The</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>Method</b>
       The simple method is

           use Getopt::Mixed;
           Getopt::Mixed::getOptions(...option-descriptions...);

       You then examine the "$opt_*" variables to find out what options were specified and the @ARGV array to
       see what arguments are left.

       If <b>-a</b> is an option that doesn't take an argument, then $opt_a will be set to 1 if the option is present,
       or left undefined if the option is not present.

       If <b>-b</b> is an option that takes an argument, then $opt_b will be set to the value of the argument if the
       option is present, or left undefined if the option is not present.  If the argument is optional but not
       supplied, $opt_b will be set to the null string.

       Note that even if you specify that an option <u>requires</u> a string argument, you can still get the null
       string (if the user specifically enters it).  If the option requires a numeric argument, you will never
       get the null string (because it isn't a number).

       When converting the option name to a Perl identifier, any non-word characters in the name will be
       converted to underscores ("_").

       If the same option occurs more than once, only the last occurrence will be recorded.  If that's not
       acceptable, you'll have to use the flexible method instead.

   <b>The</b> <b>Flexible</b> <b>Method</b>
       The flexible method is

           use Getopt::Mixed "nextOption";
           Getopt::Mixed::init(...option-descriptions...);
           while (($option, $value, $pretty) = nextOption()) {
               ...process option...
           }
           Getopt::Mixed::cleanup();

       This lets you process arguments one at a time.  You can then handle repeated options any way you want to.
       It also lets you see option names with non-alphanumeric characters without any translation.  This is also
       the only method that lets you find out what order the options and other arguments were in.

       First, you call Getopt::Mixed::init with the option descriptions.  Then, you keep calling nextOption
       until it returns an empty list.  Finally, you call Getopt::Mixed::cleanup when you're done.  The
       remaining (non-option) arguments will be found in @ARGV.

       Each call to nextOption returns a list of the next option, its value, and the option as the user typed
       it.  The value will be undefined if the option does not take an argument.  The option is stripped of its
       starter (e.g., you get "a" and "foo", not "-a" or "--foo").  If you want to print an error message, use
       the third element, which does include the option starter.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Getopt::Mixed provides one other function you can use.  "abortMsg" prints its arguments on STDERR, plus
       your program's name and a newline.  It then exits with status 1.  For example, if <u>foo.pl</u> calls "abortMsg"
       like this:

         Getopt::Mixed::abortMsg("Error");

       The output will be:

         foo.pl: Error

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOMIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       There are several customization variables you can set.  All of these variables should be set <u>after</u>
       calling Getopt::Mixed::init and <u>before</u> calling nextOption.

       If you set any of these variables, you <u>must</u> check the version number first.  The easiest way to do this
       is like this:

           use Getopt::Mixed 1.006;

       If you are using the simple method, and you want to set these variables, you'll need to call init before
       calling getOptions, like this:

           use Getopt::Mixed 1.006;
           Getopt::Mixed::init(...option-descriptions...);
           ...set configuration variables...
           Getopt::Mixed::getOptions();      # IMPORTANT: no parameters

       $order
           $order can be set to $REQUIRE_ORDER, $PERMUTE, or $RETURN_IN_ORDER.  The default is $REQUIRE_ORDER if
           the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT has been set, $PERMUTE otherwise.

           $REQUIRE_ORDER means that no options can follow the first argument which isn't an option.

           $PERMUTE means that all options are treated as if they preceded all other arguments.

           $RETURN_IN_ORDER  means  that  all arguments maintain their ordering.  When nextOption is called, and
           the next argument is not an option, it returns the null string as the option and the argument as  the
           value.  nextOption never returns the null list until all the arguments have been processed.

       $ignoreCase
           Ignore case when matching options.  Default is 1 unless the option descriptions contain an upper-case
           letter.

       $optionStart
           A string of characters that can start options.  Default is "-".

       $badOption
           A  reference  to  a function that is called when an unrecognized option is encountered.  The function
           receives three arguments.  $_[0] is the position in @ARGV where the option came from.  $_[1]  is  the
           option  as  the  user  typed  it  (including the option start character).  $_[2] is either undef or a
           string describing the reason the option was not recognized (Currently, the  only  possible  value  is
           'ambiguous',  for  a long option with several possible matches).  The option has already been removed
           from @ARGV.  To put it back, you can say:

               splice(@ARGV,$_[0],0,$_[1]);

           The function can do anything you want to @ARGV.  It should return whatever  you  want  nextOption  to
           return.

           The default is a function that prints an error message and exits the program.

       $checkArg
           A  reference  to  a  function that is called to make sure the argument type is correct.  The function
           receives four arguments.  $_[0] is the position in @ARGV where the option came from.   $_[1]  is  the
           text following the option, or undefined if there was no text following the option.  $_[2] is the name
           of  the  option  as  the  user  typed  it  (including the option start character), suitable for error
           messages.  $_[3] is the argument type specifier.

           The function can do anything you want to @ARGV.  It should return the value for this option.

           The default is a function that prints an error message and exits the program if the argument  is  not
           the  right type for the option.  You can also adjust the behavior of the default function by changing
           $intRegexp or $floatRegexp.

       $intRegexp
           A regular expression that matches an integer.  Default is '^[-+]?\d+$', which  matches  a  string  of
           digits  preceded  by  an  optional  sign.   Unlike  the other configuration variables, this cannot be
           changed after nextOption is called, because the pattern is compiled only once.

       $floatRegexp
           A regular expression that matches a floating point number.   Default  is  '^[-+]?(\d*\.?\d+|\d+\.)$',
           which matches the following formats: "123", "123.", "123.45", and ".123" (plus an optional sign).  It
           does  not  match  exponential  notation.   Unlike  the  other configuration variables, this cannot be
           changed after nextOption is called, because the pattern is compiled only once.

       $typeChars
           A string of the characters which are legal  argument  types.   The  default  is  'sif',  for  String,
           Integer,  and  Floating  point  arguments.   The  string  should consist only of letters.  Upper case
           letters are discouraged, since this will hamper the case-folding of options.  If you change this, you
           should set $checkType to a function that will check arguments of your new  type.   Unlike  the  other
           configuration variables, this must be set <u>before</u> calling <b>init()</b>, and cannot be changed afterwards.

       $checkType
           If  you  add new types to $typeChars, you should set this to a function which will check arguments of
           the new types.

       Getopt::Long

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Getopt::Mixed requires no configuration files or environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       •   This document should be expanded.

       •   A long option must be at least two characters long.  Sorry.

       •   The "!" argument specifier of Getopt::Long is not supported, but you could  have  options  <b>--foo</b>  and
           <b>--nofoo</b> and then do something like:

               $opt_foo = 0 if $opt_nofoo;

       •   The  "@" argument specifier of Getopt::Long is not supported.  If you want your values pushed into an
           array, you'll have to use nextOption and do it yourself.
