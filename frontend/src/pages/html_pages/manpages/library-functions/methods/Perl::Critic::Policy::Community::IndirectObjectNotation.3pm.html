</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::IndirectObjectNotation - Don't call methods indirectly

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Perl allows a form of method call where the method name is first, followed by the invocant (class or
       object to call the method on), then the argument list.  This is an unfortunate legacy syntax that should
       no longer be used. See "Indirect Object Syntax" in perlobj and "REFERENCES" in indirect for more
       information.

        my $obj = new My::Class @args;   # not ok
        my $obj = My::Class-&gt;new(@args); # ok

       It is difficult to detect indirect object notation by static analysis, so this policy only forbids the
       "new" method call by default, as it is highly unlikely to be the name of a standard subroutine call.
       Consider using the indirect pragma to cause the code to warn or die when indirect object notation is
       used.

       On Perl 5.32 or newer (or automatically with "use v5.36" or newer), "The 'indirect' feature" in feature
       can be disabled to prevent the parser from interpreting syntax as indirect object notation.

       This policy is a subclass of the Perl::Critic core policy
       Perl::Critic::Policy::Objects::ProhibitIndirectSyntax, and performs the same function but in the
       "community" theme.

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy is part of Perl::Critic::Community.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy can be configured, in the same way as its parent policy
       Perl::Critic::Policy::Objects::ProhibitIndirectSyntax, to attempt to forbid additional method names from
       being called indirectly. Be aware this may lead to false positives as it is difficult to detect indirect
       object notation by static analysis. The "new" subroutine is always forbidden in addition to these.

        [Community::IndirectObjectNotation]
        forbid = create destroy
