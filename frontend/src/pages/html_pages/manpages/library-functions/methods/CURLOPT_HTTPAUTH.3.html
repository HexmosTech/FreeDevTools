       CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH - HTTP server authentication methods to try

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH, long bitmask);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pass  a  long as parameter, which is set to a bitmask, to tell libcurl which authentication method(s) you
       want it to use speaking to the remote server.

       The available bits are listed below. If more than one bit is set, libcurl first queries the host  to  see
       which  authentication  methods  it  supports  and  then  picks the best one you allow it to use. For some
       methods, this  induces  an  extra  network  round-trip.  Set  the  actual  name  and  password  with  the
       <u><a href="../man3/CURLOPT_USERPWD.3.html">CURLOPT_USERPWD</a>(3)</u> option or with the <u><a href="../man3/CURLOPT_USERNAME.3.html">CURLOPT_USERNAME</a>(3)</u> and the <u><a href="../man3/CURLOPT_PASSWORD.3.html">CURLOPT_PASSWORD</a>(3)</u> options.

       For authentication with a proxy, see <u><a href="../man3/CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH.3.html">CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH</a>(3)</u>.

       CURLAUTH_BASIC
              HTTP  Basic authentication. This is the default choice, and the only method that is in wide-spread
              use and supported virtually everywhere. This sends the username and password over the  network  in
              plain text, easily captured by others.

       CURLAUTH_DIGEST
              HTTP  Digest authentication. Digest authentication is defined in RFC 2617 and is a more secure way
              to do authentication over public networks than the regular old-fashioned Basic method.

       CURLAUTH_DIGEST_IE
              HTTP Digest authentication with an IE flavor. Digest authentication is defined in RFC 2617 and  is
              a  more  secure way to do authentication over public networks than the regular old-fashioned Basic
              method. The IE flavor is simply that libcurl uses a special "quirk" that IE is known to have  used
              before version 7 and that some servers require the client to use.

       CURLAUTH_BEARER
              HTTP Bearer token authentication, used primarily in OAuth 2.0 protocol.

              You can set the Bearer token to use with <u><a href="../man3/CURLOPT_XOAUTH2_BEARER.3.html">CURLOPT_XOAUTH2_BEARER</a>(3)</u>.

       CURLAUTH_NEGOTIATE
              HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication. Negotiate authentication is defined in RFC 4559 and is the
              most secure way to perform authentication over HTTP.

              You need to build libcurl with a suitable GSS-API library or SSPI on Windows for this to work.

       CURLAUTH_NTLM
              HTTP  NTLM  authentication.  A  proprietary  protocol  invented  and  used by Microsoft. It uses a
              challenge-response and hash concept  similar  to  Digest,  to  prevent  the  password  from  being
              eavesdropped.

              NTLM uses weak cryptographic algorithms and is not considered secure.

       CURLAUTH_NTLM_WB
              Support for this is removed since libcurl 8.8.0.

              NTLM  delegating  to  winbind helper. Authentication is performed by a separate binary application
              that is executed when needed. The name of the application is specified  at  compile  time  but  is
              typically <b>/usr/bin/ntlm_auth</b>.

              Note  that  libcurl forks when necessary to run the winbind application and kill it when complete,
              calling <b>waitpid()</b> to await its exit when done. On POSIX operating  systems,  killing  the  process
              causes  a  SIGCHLD  signal  to be raised (regardless of whether <u><a href="../man3/CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL.3.html">CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL</a>(3)</u> is set), which
              must be handled intelligently  by  the  application.  In  particular,  the  application  must  not
              unconditionally  call  wait()  in  its  SIGCHLD  signal  handler  to avoid being subject to a race
              condition. This behavior is subject to change in future versions of libcurl.

       CURLAUTH_ANY
              This is a convenience macro that sets all bits and thus makes libcurl pick any it finds  suitable.
              libcurl automatically selects the one it finds most secure.

       CURLAUTH_ANYSAFE
              This  is  a  convenience  macro that sets all bits except Basic and thus makes libcurl pick any it
              finds suitable. libcurl automatically selects the one it finds most secure.

       CURLAUTH_ONLY
              This is a meta symbol. OR this value together with a single specific auth value to  force  libcurl
              to probe for unrestricted auth and if not, only that single auth algorithm is acceptable.

       CURLAUTH_AWS_SIGV4
              provides AWS V4 signature authentication on HTTPS header see <u><a href="../man3/CURLOPT_AWS_SIGV4.3.html">CURLOPT_AWS_SIGV4</a>(3)</u>.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b></h4><pre>

           CURLcode ret;
           curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
           /* allow whatever auth the server speaks */
           curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH, (long)CURLAUTH_ANY);
           curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_USERPWD, "james:bond");
