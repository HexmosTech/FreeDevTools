</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Parse::Method::Signatures - Perl6 like method signature parser

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Inspired by Perl6::Signature but streamlined to just support the subset deemed useful for TryCatch and
       MooseX::Method::Signatures.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       •   Document the parameter return types.

       •   Probably lots of other things

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  only two public methods to this module, both of which should be called as class methods. Both
       methods accept  either a single (non-ref) scalar as the value for the "input" attribute,  or  normal  new
       style arguments (hash or hash-ref).

   <b>signature</b>
        my $sig = Parse::Method::Signatures-&gt;signature( '(Str $foo)' )

       Attempts to parse the (bracketed) method signature. Returns a value or croaks on error.

   <b>param</b>
         my $param = Parse::Method::Signatures-&gt;param( 'Str $foo where { length($_) &lt; 10 }')

       Attempts to parse the specification for a single parameter. Returns value or croaks on error.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       All the attributes on this class are read-only.

   <b>input</b>
       <b>Type:</b> Str

       The string to parse.

   <b>offset</b>
       <b>Type:</b> Int

       Offset into "input" at which to start parsing. Useful for using with Devel::Declare linestring

   <b>signature_class</b>
       <b>Default:</b> Parse::Method::Signatures::Sig

       <b>Type:</b> Str (loaded on demand class name)

   <b>param_class</b>
       <b>Default:</b> Parse::Method::Signatures::Param

       <b>Type:</b> Str (loaded on demand class name)

   <b>type_constraint_class</b>
       <b>Default:</b> Parse::Method::Signatures::TypeConstraint

       <b>Type:</b> Str (loaded on demand class name)

       Class that is used to turn the parsed type constraint into an actual Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object.

   <b>from_namespace</b>
       <b>Type:</b> ClassName

       Let this module know which package it is parsing signatures form. This is entirely optional, and the only
       effect is has is on parsing type constraints.

       If  this  attribute  is  set  it  is passed to "type_constraint_class" which can use it to introspect the
       package   (commonly   for   MooseX::Types   exported   types).   See   "find_registered_constraint"    in
       Parse::Method::Signature::TypeConstraints for more details.

   <b>type_constraint_callback</b>
       <b>Type:</b> CodeRef

       Passed  to the constructor of "type_constraint_class". Default implementation of this callback asks Moose
       for a type constrain matching the name passed in.  If you have more complex requirements, such as parsing
       types created by MooseX::Types then you will want a callback similar to this:

        # my $target_package defined elsewhere.
        my $tc_cb = sub {
          my ($pms_tc, $name) = @_;
          my $code = $target_package-&gt;can($name);
          $code ? eval { $code-&gt;() }
                : $pms_tc-&gt;find_registered_constraint($name);
        }

       Note that the above example is better provided by providing the "from_namespace" attribute.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Like Perl6::Signature, the parsing of certain constructs is currently only a 'best effort' - specifically
       default values and where code blocks might not successfully for certain  complex  cases.  Patches/Failing
       tests welcome.

       Additionally,  default value specifications are not evaluated which means that no such lexical or similar
       errors will not be produced by this module.  Constant folding will also not be performed.

       There are certain constructs that are simply too much hassle to avoid when the  work  around  is  simple.
       Currently  the  only  cases  that  are known to parse wrong are when using anonymous variables (i.e. just
       sigils) in unpacked arrays. Take the following example:

        method foo (ArrayRef [$, $], $some_value_we_care_about) {

       In this case the $] is treated as one of perl's magic variables (specifically, the  patch  level  of  the
       Perl  interpreter)  rather than a "$" followed by a "]" as was almost certainly intended. The work around
       for this is simple: introduce a space between the characters:

        method foo (ArrayRef [ $, $ ], $some_value_we_care_about) {

       The same applies
