       Class::MakeMethods::Docs::Catalog - List of Makable Method Types

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document lists the various subclasses of Class::MakeMethods included in this distribution, and the
       method types each one provides.

       See the documentation for each implementation for more details about the features it provides.

       For each class, a parenthetical comment indicates whether the methods it generates are applicable to
       individual blessed objects (Instances), to class data (Global), or both (Any) =head2 Scoping

       The final part of the name of a method-generating subclass typically indicates the scope or applicability
       of the methods it generates

       Hash
           For object instances based on blessed hashes with named values.

       Array
           For object instances based on blessed arrays with positional values.

       Scalar
           For object instances based on blessed scalars with a single value.

       InsideOut
           For any object instance regardless of underlying data type.

       Ref For any object instance regardless of underlying data type.

       Inheritable
           For data which can be set at the class, subclass, or instance level.

       Class
           For class data shared by all instances but different for each subclass

       ClassVar
           For class data shared by all instances but different for each subclass

       ClassInherit
           For class data shared by all instances but different for each subclass

       Global
           For global data shared by a class and all its instances and subclasses

       PackageVar
           For global data shared by a class and all its instances and subclasses

       Universal
           # General method types that are widely applicable

       •   string: get and set a class-specific string value
