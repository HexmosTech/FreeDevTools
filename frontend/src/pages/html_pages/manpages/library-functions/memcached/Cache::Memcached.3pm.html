</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the Perl API for memcached, a distributed memory cache daemon.  More information is available at:

         <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">http://www.danga.com/memcached/</a>

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       "new"
           Takes one parameter, a hashref of options.  The most important key is "servers", but that can also be
           set  later with the "set_servers" method.  The servers must be an arrayref of hosts, each of which is
           either a scalar of the form "10.0.0.10:11211" or an arrayref of the  former  and  an  integer  weight
           value.  (The default weight if unspecified is 1.)  It's recommended that weight values be kept as low
           as  possible,  as  this module currently allocates memory for bucket distribution proportional to the
           total host weights.

           Use "compress_threshold" to set a compression threshold, in bytes.  Values larger than this threshold
           will be compressed by "set" and decompressed by "get".

           Use "no_rehash" to disable finding a new memcached server when one goes down.  Your  application  may
           or may not need this, depending on your expirations and key usage.

           Use  "readonly"  to  disable  writes to backend memcached servers.  Only get and get_multi will work.
           This is useful in bizarre debug and profiling cases only.

           Use "namespace" to prefix all keys with the provided namespace value.  That is, if you set  namespace
           to  "app1:"  and later do a set of "foo" to "bar", memcached is actually seeing you set "app1:foo" to
           "bar".

           Use  "connect_timeout"  and  "select_timeout"  to  set   connection   and   polling   timeouts.   The
           "connect_timeout" defaults to .25 second, and the "select_timeout" defaults to 1 second.

           The other useful key is "debug", which when set to true will produce diagnostics on STDERR.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "set_servers"
           Sets the server list this module distributes key gets and sets between.  The format is an arrayref of
           identical form as described in the "new" constructor.

       "set_debug"
           Sets the "debug" flag.  See "new" constructor for more information.

       "set_readonly"
           Sets the "readonly" flag.  See "new" constructor for more information.

       "set_norehash"
           Sets the "no_rehash" flag.  See "new" constructor for more information.

       "set_compress_threshold"
           Sets the compression threshold. See "new" constructor for more information.

       "set_connect_timeout"
           Sets the connect timeout. See "new" constructor for more information.

       "set_select_timeout"
           Sets the select timeout. See "new" constructor for more information.

       "enable_compress"
           Temporarily  enable or disable compression.  Has no effect if "compress_threshold" isn't set, but has
           an overriding effect if it is.

       "get"
           my $val = $memd-&gt;get($key);

           Retrieves a key from the memcache.   Returns  the  value  (automatically  thawed  with  Storable,  if
           necessary) or undef.

           The  $key  can optionally be an arrayref, with the first element being the hash value, if you want to
           avoid making this module calculate a hash value.  You may prefer, for example, to keep all of a given
           user's objects on the same memcache server, so you could use the user's unique id as the hash value.

       "get_multi"
           my $hashref = $memd-&gt;get_multi(@keys);

           Retrieves multiple keys from the memcache doing just one query.  Returns a hashref of key/value pairs
           that were available.

           This method is recommended over regular 'get' as it lowers the number of total packets flying  around
           your  network,  reducing  total  latency,  since your app doesn't have to wait for each round-trip of
           'get' before sending the next one.

       "set"
           $memd-&gt;set($key, $value[, $exptime]);

           Unconditionally sets a key to a given  value  in  the  memcache.   Returns  true  if  it  was  stored
           successfully.

           The  $key  can  optionally  be an arrayref, with the first element being the hash value, as described
           above.

           The $exptime (expiration time) defaults to "never" if unspecified.  If you want the key to expire  in
           memcached, pass an integer $exptime.  If value is less than 60*60*24*30 (30 days), time is assumed to
           be relative from the present.  If larger, it's considered an absolute Unix time.

       "add"
           $memd-&gt;add($key, $value[, $exptime]);

           Like "set", but only stores in memcache if the key doesn't already exist.

       "replace"
           $memd-&gt;replace($key, $value[, $exptime]);

           Like "set", but only stores in memcache if the key already exists.  The opposite of "add".

       "delete"
           $memd-&gt;delete($key[, $time]);

           Deletes  a  key.  You may optionally provide an integer time value (in seconds) to tell the memcached
           server to block new writes to this key for that many seconds.  (Sometimes useful as a hacky means  to
           prevent races.)  Returns true if key was found and deleted, and false otherwise.

           You  may  also  use the alternate method name <b>remove</b>, so Cache::Memcached looks like the Cache::Cache
           API.

       "incr"
           $memd-&gt;incr($key[, $value]);

           Sends a command to the server to atomically increment the value for $key by $value, or by 1 if $value
           is undefined.  Returns undef if $key doesn't exist on server, otherwise  it  returns  the  new  value
           after  incrementing.   Value should be zero or greater.  Overflow on server is not checked.  Be aware
           of values approaching 2**32.  See decr.

       "decr"
           $memd-&gt;decr($key[, $value]);

           Like incr, but decrements.  Unlike incr, underflow is checked and new values are  capped  at  0.   If
           server value is 1, a decrement of 2 returns 0, not -1.

       "stats"
           $memd-&gt;stats([$keys]);

           Returns  a  hashref  of statistical data regarding the memcache server(s), the $memd object, or both.
           $keys can be an arrayref of keys wanted, a single key wanted, or absent (in which  case  the  default
           value is malloc, sizes, self, and the empty string).  These keys are the values passed to the 'stats'
           command  issued  to the memcached server(s), except for 'self' which is internal to the $memd object.
           Allowed values are:

           "misc"
               The stats returned by a 'stats' command:  pid, uptime, version, bytes, get_hits, etc.

           "malloc"
               The stats returned by a 'stats malloc':  total_alloc, arena_size, etc.

           "sizes"
               The stats returned by a 'stats sizes'.

           "self"
               The stats for the $memd object itself (a copy of $memd-&gt;{'stats'}).

           "maps"
               The stats returned by a 'stats maps'.

           "cachedump"
               The stats returned by a 'stats cachedump'.

           "slabs"
               The stats returned by a 'stats slabs'.

           "items"
               The stats returned by a 'stats items'.

       "disconnect_all"
           $memd-&gt;disconnect_all;

           Closes all cached sockets to all memcached servers.  You must do this if your program forks  and  the
           parent  has  used  this  module  at  all.   Otherwise the children will try to use cached sockets and
           they'll fight (as children do) and garble the client/server protocol.

       "flush_all"
           $memd-&gt;flush_all;

           Runs the memcached "flush_all" command on all configured  hosts,  emptying  all  their  caches.   (or
           rather,  invalidating all items in the caches in an <a href="../man1/O.1.html">O</a>(1) operation...)  Running stats will still show
           the item existing, they're just be non-existent and lazily destroyed next time you try to  detch  any
           of them.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       When  a server goes down, this module does detect it, and re-hashes the request to the remaining servers,
       but the way it does it isn't very clean.  The result may be that it gives up  during  its  rehashing  and
       refuses to get/set something it could've, had it been done right.
