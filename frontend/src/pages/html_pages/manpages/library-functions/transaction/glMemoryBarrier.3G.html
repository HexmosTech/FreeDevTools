</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>GLMEMORYBARRIER</b></h4><pre>
       <b>glMemoryBarrier</b> defines a barrier ordering the memory transactions issued prior to the command relative
       to those issued after the barrier. For the purposes of this ordering, memory transactions performed by
       shaders are considered to be issued by the rendering command that triggered the execution of the shader.
       <u>barriers</u> is a bitfield indicating the set of operations that are synchronized with shader stores; the
       bits used in <u>barriers</u> are as follows:

       <b>GL_VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_BARRIER_BIT</b>
           If set, vertex data sourced from buffer objects after the barrier will reflect data written by
           shaders prior to the barrier. The set of buffer objects affected by this bit is derived from the
           buffer object bindings used for generic vertex attributes derived from the
           <b>GL_VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_BUFFER</b> bindings.

       <b>GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BARRIER_BIT</b>
           If set, vertex array indices sourced from buffer objects after the barrier will reflect data written
           by shaders prior to the barrier. The buffer objects affected by this bit are derived from the
           <b>GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER</b> binding.

       <b>GL_UNIFORM_BARRIER_BIT</b>
           Shader uniforms sourced from buffer objects after the barrier will reflect data written by shaders
           prior to the barrier.

       <b>GL_TEXTURE_FETCH_BARRIER_BIT</b>
           Texture fetches from shaders, including fetches from buffer object memory via buffer textures, after
           the barrier will reflect data written by shaders prior to the barrier.

       <b>GL_SHADER_IMAGE_ACCESS_BARRIER_BIT</b>
           Memory accesses using shader image load, store, and atomic built-in functions issued after the
           barrier will reflect data written by shaders prior to the barrier. Additionally, image stores and
           atomics issued after the barrier will not execute until all memory accesses (e.g., loads, stores,
           texture fetches, vertex fetches) initiated prior to the barrier complete.

       <b>GL_COMMAND_BARRIER_BIT</b>
           Command data sourced from buffer objects by Draw*Indirect commands after the barrier will reflect
           data written by shaders prior to the barrier. The buffer objects affected by this bit are derived
           from the <b>GL_DRAW_INDIRECT_BUFFER</b> binding.

       <b>GL_PIXEL_BUFFER_BARRIER_BIT</b>
           Reads and writes of buffer objects via the <b>GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER</b> and <b>GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER</b> bindings
           (via <b>glReadPixels</b>(), <b>glTexSubImage1D</b>(), etc.) after the barrier will reflect data written by shaders
           prior to the barrier. Additionally, buffer object writes issued after the barrier will wait on the
           completion of all shader writes initiated prior to the barrier.

       <b>GL_TEXTURE_UPDATE_BARRIER_BIT</b>
           Writes to a texture via <b>glTex(Sub)Image*</b>, <b>glCopyTex(Sub)Image*</b>, <b>glCompressedTex(Sub)Image*</b>, and reads
           via <b>glGetTexImage</b>() after the barrier will reflect data written by shaders prior to the barrier.
           Additionally, texture writes from these commands issued after the barrier will not execute until all
           shader writes initiated prior to the barrier complete.

       <b>GL_BUFFER_UPDATE_BARRIER_BIT</b>
           Reads or writes via <b>glBufferSubData</b>(), <b>glCopyBufferSubData</b>(), or <b>glGetBufferSubData</b>(), or to buffer
           object memory mapped by <b>glMapBuffer</b>() or <b>glMapBufferRange</b>() after the barrier will reflect data
           written by shaders prior to the barrier. Additionally, writes via these commands issued after the
           barrier will wait on the completion of any shader writes to the same memory initiated prior to the
           barrier.

       <b>GL_FRAMEBUFFER_BARRIER_BIT</b>
           Reads and writes via framebuffer object attachments after the barrier will reflect data written by
           shaders prior to the barrier. Additionally, framebuffer writes issued after the barrier will wait on
           the completion of all shader writes issued prior to the barrier.

       <b>GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BARRIER_BIT</b>
           Writes via transform feedback bindings after the barrier will reflect data written by shaders prior
           to the barrier. Additionally, transform feedback writes issued after the barrier will wait on the
           completion of all shader writes issued prior to the barrier.

       <b>GL_ATOMIC_COUNTER_BARRIER_BIT</b>
           Accesses to atomic counters after the barrier will reflect writes prior to the barrier.

       <b>GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BARRIER_BIT</b>
           Accesses to shader storage blocks after the barrier will reflect writes prior to the barrier.

       <b>GL_QUERY_BUFFER_BARRIER_BIT</b>
           Writes of buffer objects via the <b>GL_QUERY_BUFFER</b> binding after the barrier will reflect data written
           by shaders prior to the barrier. Additionally, buffer object writes issued after the barrier will
           wait on the completion of all shader writes initiated prior to the barrier.

       If <u>barriers</u> is <b>GL_ALL_BARRIER_BITS</b>, shader memory accesses will be synchronized relative to all the
       operations described above.

       Implementations may cache buffer object and texture image memory that could be written by shaders in
       multiple caches; for example, there may be separate caches for texture, vertex fetching, and one or more
       caches for shader memory accesses. Implementations are not required to keep these caches coherent with
       shader memory writes. Stores issued by one invocation may not be immediately observable by other pipeline
       stages or other shader invocations because the value stored may remain in a cache local to the processor
       executing the store, or because data overwritten by the store is still in a cache elsewhere in the
       system. When <b>glMemoryBarrier</b> is called, the GL flushes and/or invalidates any caches relevant to the
       operations specified by the <u>barriers</u> parameter to ensure consistent ordering of operations across the
       barrier.

       To allow for independent shader invocations to communicate by reads and writes to a common memory
       address, image variables in the OpenGL Shading Language may be declared as "coherent". Buffer object or
       texture image memory accessed through such variables may be cached only if caches are automatically
       updated due to stores issued by any other shader invocation. If the same address is accessed using both
       coherent and non-coherent variables, the accesses using variables declared as coherent will observe the
       results stored using coherent variables in other invocations. Using variables declared as "coherent"
       guarantees only that the results of stores will be immediately visible to shader invocations using
       similarly-declared variables; calling <b>glMemoryBarrier</b> is required to ensure that the stores are visible
       to other operations.

       The following guidelines may be helpful in choosing when to use coherent memory accesses and when to use
       barriers.

       •   Data that are read-only or constant may be accessed without using coherent variables or calling
           <b>MemoryBarrier</b>(). Updates to the read-only data via API calls such as <b>glBufferSubData</b> will invalidate
           shader caches implicitly as required.

       •   Data that are shared between shader invocations at a fine granularity (e.g., written by one
           invocation, consumed by another invocation) should use coherent variables to read and write the
           shared data.

       •   Data written by one shader invocation and consumed by other shader invocations launched as a result
           of its execution ("dependent invocations") should use coherent variables in the producing shader
           invocation and call <b>memoryBarrier</b>() after the last write. The consuming shader invocation should also
           use coherent variables.

       •   Data written to image variables in one rendering pass and read by the shader in a later pass need not
           use coherent variables or memoryBarrier(). Calling <b>glMemoryBarrier</b> with the
           SHADER_IMAGE_ACCESS_BARRIER_BIT set in <u>barriers</u> between passes is necessary.

       •   Data written by the shader in one rendering pass and read by another mechanism (e.g., vertex or index
           buffer pulling) in a later pass need not use coherent variables or <b>memoryBarrier</b>(). Calling
           <b>glMemoryBarrier</b> with the appropriate bits set in <u>barriers</u> between passes is necessary.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>GLMEMORYBARRIERBYREGION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>glMemoryBarrierByRegion</b> behaves as described above for <b>glMemoryBarrier</b>, with two differences:

       First, it narrows the region under consideration so that only reads and writes of prior fragment shaders
       that are invoked for a smaller region of the framebuffer will be completed/reflected prior to subsequent
       reads and writes of following fragment shaders. The size of the region is implementation-dependent and
       may be as small as one framebuffer pixel.

       Second, it only applies to memory transactions that may be read by or written by a fragment shader.
       Therefore, only the barrier bits

       •   <b>GL_ATOMIC_COUNTER_BARRIER_BIT</b>

       •   <b>GL_FRAMEBUFFER_BARRIER_BIT</b>

       •   <b>GL_SHADER_IMAGE_ACCESS_BARRIER_BIT</b>

       •   <b>GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BARRIER_BIT</b>

       •   <b>GL_TEXTURE_FETCH_BARRIER_BIT</b>

       •   <b>GL_UNIFORM_BARRIER_BIT</b>

       are supported.

       When <u>barriers</u> is <b>GL_ALL_BARRIER_BITS</b>, shader memory accesses will be synchronized relative to all these
       barrier bits, but not to other barrier bits specific to <b>glMemoryBarrier</b>. This implies that reads and
       writes for scatter/gather-like algorithms may or may not be completed/reflected after a
       <b>glMemoryBarrierByRegion</b> command. However, for uses such as deferred shading, where a linked list of
       visible surfaces with the head at a framebuffer address may be constructed, and the entirety of the list
       is only dependent on previous executions at that framebuffer address, <b>glMemoryBarrierByRegion</b> may be
       significantly more efficient than <b>glMemoryBarrier</b>.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BARRIER_BIT</b> is available only if the GL version is 4.3 or higher.

       <b>GL_QUERY_BUFFER_BARRIER_BIT</b> is available only if the GL version is 4.4 or higher.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>GL_INVALID_VALUE</b> is generated if <u>barriers</u> is not the special value <b>GL_ALL_BARRIER_BITS</b>, and has any bits
       set other than those described above for <b>glMemoryBarrier</b> or <b>glMemoryBarrierByRegion</b> respectively.
