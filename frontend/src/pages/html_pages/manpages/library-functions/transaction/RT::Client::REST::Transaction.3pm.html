</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       RT::Client::REST::Transaction - transaction object representation.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.72

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $transactions = $ticket-&gt;transactions;

         my $count = $transactions-&gt;count;
         print "There are $count transactions.\n";

         my $iterator = $transactions-&gt;get_iterator;
         while (my $tr = &amp;$iterator) {
             print "Id: ", $tr-&gt;id, "; Type: ", $tr-&gt;type, "\n";
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A transaction is a second-class citizen, as it does not exist (at least from the current REST protocol
       implementation) by itself.  At the moment, it is always associated with a ticket (see <b>parent_id</b>
       attribute).  Thus, you will rarely retrieve a transaction by itself; instead, you should use
       "transactions()" method of RT::Client::REST::Ticket object to get an iterator for all (or some)
       transactions for that ticket.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>id</b>
         Numeric ID of the transaction.

       <b>creator</b>
         Username of the user who created the transaction.

       <b>parent_id</b>
         Numeric ID of the object the transaction is associated with.

       <b>type</b>
         Type  of  the transactions.  Please refer to RT::Client::REST documentation for the list of transaction
         types you can expect this field to contain.   Note  that  there  may  be  some  transaction  types  not
         (dis)covered yet.

       <b>old_value</b>
         Old value.

       <b>new_value</b>
         New value.

       <b>field</b>
         Name of the field the transaction is describing (if any).

       <b>attachments</b>
         I have never seen it set to anything yet.  (I will some day investigate this).

       <b>created</b>
         Time when the transaction was created.

       <b>content</b>
         Actual content of the transaction.

       <b>description</b>
         Human-readable description of the transaction as provided by RT.

       <b>data</b>
         Not sure what this is yet.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>RT::Client::REST::Transaction</b>  is  a read-only object, so you cannot "store()" it.  Also, because it is a
       second-class citizen, you cannot "search()" or "count()" it -- use "transactions()"  method  provided  by
       RT::Client::REST::Ticket.

       retrieve
         To retrieve a transaction, attributes <b>id</b> and <b>parent_id</b> must be set.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rt_type</b>
         Returns 'transaction'.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       RT::Client::REST, RT::Client::REST::Ticket, RT::Client::REST::SearchResult.
