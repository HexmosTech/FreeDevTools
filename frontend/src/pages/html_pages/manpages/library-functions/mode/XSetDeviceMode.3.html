       XSetDeviceMode - change the mode of a device

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;

       XSetDeviceMode( Display *display,
                       XDevice *device,
                       int mode);

       display
              Specifies the connection to the X server.

       device
              Specifies the device whose mode is to be changed.

       mode
              Specifies the mode. You can pass Absolute, or Relative.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
           The XSetDeviceMode request changes the mode of an input device
           that is capable of reporting either absolute positional
           information or relative motion information. Not all input
           devices are capable of reporting motion data, and not all are
           capable of changing modes from Absolute to Relative.

           XSetDeviceMode can generate a BadDevice or BadMode error.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
           BadDevice
                  An invalid device was specified. The specified device
                  does not exist or has not been opened by this client via
                  XOpenInputDevice. This error may also occur if some
                  other client has caused the specified device to become
                  the X keyboard or X pointer device via the
                  XChangeKeyboardDevice or XChangePointerDevice requests.

           BadMatch
                  This error may occur if an XSetDeviceMode request is
                  made specifying a device that has no valuators and
                  reports no axes of motion.

           BadMode
                  An invalid mode was specified. This error will also be
                  returned if the specified device is not capable of
                  supporting the XSetDeviceMode request.
