</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test2::Harness::Runner::Job - Representation of a test job.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module takes all the data from a test file queue item, a run, and runner settings, and mashes them
       together to figure out what is actually needed to run a job.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Note, this object subclasses Test2::Harness::IPC::Process.

       $arrayref = $job-&gt;args
           Get the arguments for the test either formt he queue item, or from the run.

       $path = $job-&gt;bail_file
           Path to the events-file used in case of a bail-out

       $bool = $job-&gt;bailed_out
           True if the test job bailed out.

       $cat $job-&gt;category
           Process category, always 'job' unless overriden in a subclass.

       $path = $job-&gt;ch_dir
           If this job first requires a change in directory before running, this will return the path.

       @list = $job-&gt;cli_includes
           List of includes for a command line launch of this job.

       @list = $job-&gt;cli_options
           List of options for a command line launch of this job.

       $hashref = $job-&gt;env_vars
           Get environment variables to set when launching this job.

       $path = $job-&gt;out_file
           File to which all STDOUT for the job will be written.

       $path = $job-&gt;err_file
           File to which all STDERR for the job will be written.

       $path = $job-&gt;et_file
           File to which event timeout notifications will be written.

       $path = $job-&gt;pet_file
           File to which post exit timeout events will be written.

       $path = $job-&gt;event_dir
           Directory to which Test2::Formatter::Stream events will be written.

       $time = $job-&gt;event_timeout
           Event timeout specification, if any, first from test queue item, then from runner.

       $time = $job-&gt;post_exit_timeout
           Post exit timeout specification, if any, first from test queue item, then from runner.

       $bool = $job-&gt;event_uuids
           Use Test2::Plugin::UUID inside the test.

       $path = $job-&gt;file
           Test file the job will be running.

       $coderef = $job-&gt;fork_callback
           If the job is to be launched via fork, use this callback.

       $path = $job-&gt;in_file
           File containing STDIN to be provided to the test.

       @list = $job-&gt;includes
           Paths to add to @INC for the test.

       $bool = $job-&gt;io_events
           True if Test2::Plugin::IOEvents should be used.

       $int = $job-&gt;is_try
           This starts at 0 and will be incremented for every retry of the job.

       $path = $job-&gt;job_dir
           Temporary directory housing all files related to this job when it runs.

       $uuid = $job-&gt;job_id
           UUID for this job.

       @list = $job-&gt;load
           Modules to load when starting this job.

       @list = $job-&gt;load_import
           Modules to load and import when starting this job.

       $bool = $job-&gt;mem_usage
           True if the Test2::Plugin::MemUsage plugin should be used.

       $path = $job-&gt;run_file
           Usually the same as rel_file, but you can specify an alternative file to actually run.

       $path = $job-&gt;rel_file
           Relative path to the file.

       $int = $job-&gt;retry
           How many times the test should be retried if it fails.

       $bool = $job-&gt;retry_isolated
           True if the test should be retried in isolation if it fails.
