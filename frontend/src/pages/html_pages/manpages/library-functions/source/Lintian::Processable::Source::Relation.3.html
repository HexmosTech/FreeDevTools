</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Lintian::Processable::Source::Relation - Lintian interface to source package data collection

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my ($name, $type, $dir) = ('foobar', 'source', '/path/to/lab-entry');
           my $collect = Lintian::Processable::Source::Relation-&gt;new($name);
           if ($collect-&gt;native) {
               print encode_utf8("Package is native\n");
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Lintian::Processable::Source::Relation provides an interface to package data for source packages.  It
       implements data collection methods specific to source packages.

       This module is in its infancy.  Most of Lintian still reads all data from files in the laboratory
       whenever that data is needed and generates that data via collect scripts.  The goal is to eventually
       access all data about source packages via this module so that the module can cache data where appropriate
       and possibly retire collect scripts in favor of caching that data in memory.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       binary_relation (PACKAGE, FIELD)
           Returns  a  Lintian::Relation  object  for  the  specified FIELD in the binary package PACKAGE in the
           <u>debian/control</u> file.  FIELD should be one of the possible relationship fields of a Debian package  or
           one of the following special values:

           All The concatenation of Pre-Depends, Depends, Recommends, and Suggests.

           Strong
               The concatenation of Pre-Depends and Depends.

           Weak
               The concatenation of Recommends and Suggests.

           If  FIELD  isn't present in the package, the returned Lintian::Relation object will be empty (present
           but satisfies nothing).

           Any substvars in <u>debian/control</u> will be represented in the returned relation as packages named  after
           the substvar.

       saved_binary_relations
       relation (FIELD)
           Returns  a Lintian::Relation object for the given build relationship field FIELD.  In addition to the
           normal build relationship fields, the following special field names are supported:

           Build-Depends-All
               The concatenation of Build-Depends, Build-Depends-Arch and Build-Depends-Indep.

           Build-Conflicts-All
               The concatenation of Build-Conflicts, Build-Conflicts-Arch and Build-Conflicts-Indep.

           If FIELD isn't present in the package, the returned Lintian::Relation object will be  empty  (present
           but satisfies nothing).

       saved_relation
       relation_norestriction (FIELD)
           The  same as "relation (FIELD)", but ignores architecture restrictions and build profile restrictions
           in the FIELD field.

       saved_relations_norestriction
