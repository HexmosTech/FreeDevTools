</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP::Recorder - record interaction with websites

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>This</b> <b>module</b> <b>is</b> <b>deprecated</b>
       It works by tagging links in a page, and then when a link is clicked looking on the submitted tag to see
       which link was clicked

       It can not handle Javascript-created links or JS manipulation of the page so it works only for fairly
       static websites

       For better options check out Selenium

       Patchs are welcome, and I'll fix bugs as much as I can, but please don't expect me to implement new
       features

   <b>Using</b> <b>HTTP::Recorder</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Web</b> <b>Proxy</b>
       Set HTTP::Recorder as the user agent for a proxy, and it rewrites HTTP responses so that additional
       requests can be recorded.

       <u>The</u> <u>Proxy</u> <u>Script</u>

       For quick start, run the httprecorder script

           httprecorder

       This will open a local proxy on port 8080, and will dump the recorded traffic to a file named
       http_traffic in the current directory. use the -help parameter for usage info

       Start the proxy script, then change the settings in your web browser so that it will use this proxy for
       web requests.  For more information about proxy settings and the default port, see HTTP::Proxy.

       The script will be recorded in the specified file, and can be viewed and modified via the control panel.

       For better control, use this example:

           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>

           use HTTP::Proxy;
           use HTTP::Recorder;

           my $proxy = HTTP::Proxy-&gt;new();

           # create a new HTTP::Recorder object
           my $agent = new HTTP::Recorder;

           # set the log file (optional)
           $agent-&gt;file("/tmp/myfile");

           # set HTTP::Recorder as the agent for the proxy
           $proxy-&gt;agent( $agent );

           # start the proxy
           $proxy-&gt;start();

       <u>Start</u> <u>Recording</u>

       Now you can use your browser as your normally would, and your actions will be recorded in the file you
       specified.  Alternatively, you can start recording from the Control Panel.

       <u>Using</u> <u>the</u> <u>Control</u> <u>Panel</u>

       If you have Javascript enabled in your browser, go to the HTTP::Recorder control URL
       (<a href="http://http-recorder">http://http-recorder</a> by default), optionally type a URL into the "Goto page" field, and click "Go".

       In the new window, interact with web sites as you normally do, including typing a new address into the
       address field.  The Control Panel will be updated after each recorded action.

       The Control Panel allows you to modify, delete, or save your script.

   <b>SSL</b> <b>sessions</b>
       As of version 0.03, HTTP::Recorder can record SSL sessions.

       To begin recording an SSL session, go to the control URL (<a href="http://http-recorder/">http://http-recorder/</a> by default), and enter
       the initial URL.  Then, interact with the web site as usual.

   <b>Script</b> <b>output</b>
       By default, HTTP::Recorder outputs WWW::Mechanize scripts.

       However, you can override HTTP::Recorder::Logger to output other types of scripts.

</pre><h4><b>Functions</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       Creates and returns a new HTTP::Recorder object, referred to as the 'agent'.

   <b>$agent-&gt;prefix([$value])</b>
       Get or set the prefix string that HTTP::Recorder uses for rewriting responses.

   <b>$agent-&gt;control([$value])</b>
       Get or set the URL of the control panel.  By default, the control URL is 'http-recorder'.

       The control URL will display a control panel which will allow you to view and edit the current script.

   <b>$agent-&gt;logger([$value])</b>
       Get or set the logger object.  The default logger is a HTTP::Recorder::Logger, which generates
       WWW::Mechanize scripts.

   <b>$agent-&gt;ignore_favicon([0|1])</b>
       Get or set ignore_favicon flag that causes HTTP::Recorder to skip logging requests favicon.ico files.
       The value is 1 by default.

   <b>$agent-&gt;file([$value])</b>
       Get or set the filename for generated scripts.  The default is '/tmp/scriptfile'.

</pre><h4><b>Bugs,</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Features,</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>Oddities</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Javascript</b>
       WWW::Mechanize can't play back Javascript actions, and HTTP::Recorder doesn't record them.

   <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>images</b> <b>corrupted?</b>
       HTTP::Recorder only tries to rewrite responses that are of type text/*, which it determines by reading
       the Content-Type header of the HTTP::Response object.  However, if the received image gives the wrong
       Content-Type header, it may be corrupted by the recorder.  While this may not be pleasant to look at, it
       shouldn't have an effect on your recording session.

       short and simple) HTML page that demonstrates the problem, and a clear explanation of a) what it does
       that it shouldn't, and b) what it should do instead.
