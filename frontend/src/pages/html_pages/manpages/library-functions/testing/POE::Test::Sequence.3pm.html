       POE::Test::Sequence - POE test helper to verify a sequence of events

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         Sorry, there isn't a synopsis at this time.

         However, see t/90_regression/whjackson-followtail.t in POE's test
         suite for a full example.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Test::Sequence is a test helper that abstracts a lot of the tedious trickery needed to verify the
       relative ordering of events.

       With this module, one can test the sequence of events without necessarily relying on specific times
       elapsing between them.

   <b>create_generic_session</b>
       The <b>create_generic_session()</b> method creates a POE::Session that routes all vents through the
       POE::Test::Sequence object.  It returns the POE::Session object, but the test program does not need to
       store it anywhere.  In fact, it's recommended not to do that without understanding the implications.

       The implications can be found in the documentation for POE::Kernel and POE::Session.

       An example of <b>create_generic_session()</b> can be found in POE's t/90_regression/leolo-alarm-adjust.t test
       program.

   <b>new</b>
       Create a new sequence object.  Takes named parameter pairs, currently just "sequence", which references
       an array of steps.  Each step is an array reference containing the expected event, a required parameter
       to that event, and a code reference for the optional next step to take after testing for that event.

         my $sequence = POE::Test::Sequence-&gt;new(
           sequence =&gt; [
           [ got_idle_event =&gt; 0, sub { append_to_log("text") } ],
           ...,
         ]
         );

       <b>next()</b> uses the first two step elements to verify that steps are occurring in the order in which they
       should.  The third element is returned by <b>next()</b> and is suitable for use as a <b>goto()</b> target.  See the
       <b>next()</b> method for more details.

   <b>next</b>
       The <b>next()</b> method requires an event name and a scalar parameter.  These are compared to the first two
       elements of the next sequence step to make sure events are happening in the order in which they should.

         sub handle_start_event {
           goto $sequence-&gt;next("got_start_event", 0);
         }

   <b>test_count</b>
       <b>test_count()</b> returns the number of test steps in the sequence object.  It's intended to be used for test
       planning.

         use Test::More;
         my $sequence = POE::Test::Sequence-&gt;new( ... );
         plan tests =&gt; $sequence-&gt;test_count();

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>create_generic_session()</b> is hard-coded to pass only the event name and the numeric value 0 to <b>next()</b>.
       This is fine for only the most generic sequences.
