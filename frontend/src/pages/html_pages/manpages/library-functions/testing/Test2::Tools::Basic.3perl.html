</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test2::Tools::Basic - Test2 implementation of the basic testing tools.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a Test2 based implementation of the more basic tools originally provided by Test::More. Not all
       Test::More tools are provided by this package, only the basic/simple ones. Some tools have been modified
       for better diagnostics capabilities.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Test2::Tools::Basic;

           ok($x, "simple test");

           if ($passing) {
               pass('a passing test');
           }
           else {
               fail('a failing test');
           }

           diag "This is a diagnostics message on STDERR";
           note "This is a diagnostics message on STDOUT";

           {
               my $todo = todo "Reason for todo";
               ok(0, "this test is todo");
           }

           ok(1, "this test is not todo");

           todo "reason" =&gt; sub {
               ok(0, "this test is todo");
           };

           ok(1, "this test is not todo");

           SKIP: {
               skip "This will wipe your drive";

               # This never gets run:
               ok(!system('sudo rm -rf /'), "Wipe drive");
           }

           done_testing;

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       All subs are exported by default.

   <b>PLANNING</b>
       plan($num)
       plan('tests' =&gt; $num)
       plan('skip_all' =&gt; $reason)
           Set  the  number  of tests that are expected. This must be done first or last, never in the middle of
           testing.

           For legacy compatibility you can specify 'tests' as the first argument before  the  number.  You  can
           also use this to skip all with the 'skip_all' prefix, followed by a reason for skipping.

       skip_all($reason)
           Set the plan to 0 with a reason, then exit true. This should be used before any tests are run.

       done_testing
           Used to mark the end of testing. This is a safe way to have a dynamic or unknown number of tests.

       bail_out($reason)
           Invoked  when something has gone horribly wrong: stop everything, kill all threads and processes, end
           the process with a false exit status.

   <b>ASSERTIONS</b>
       ok($bool)
       ok($bool, $name)
       ok($bool, $name, @diag)
           Simple assertion. If $bool is true the test passes, and if it is false the test fails. The test  name
           is  optional,  and  all  arguments after the name are added as diagnostics message if and only if the
           test fails. If the test passes all the diagnostics arguments will be ignored.

       <b>pass()</b>
       pass($name)
           Fire off a passing test (a single Ok event). The name is optional

       <b>fail()</b>
       fail($name)
       fail($name, @diag)
           Fire off a failing test (a single Ok event). The name and diagnostics are optional.

   <b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       diag(@messages)
           Write diagnostics messages. All items in @messages will be  joined  into  a  single  string  with  no
           separator. When using TAP, diagnostics are sent to STDERR.

           Returns false, so as to preserve failure.

       note(@messages)
           Write  note-diagnostics  messages. All items in @messages will be joined into a single string with no
           separator. When using TAP, notes are sent to STDOUT.

   <b>META</b>
       $todo = todo($reason)
       todo $reason =&gt; sub { ... }
           This is used to mark some results as TODO. TODO means that the test may fail, but will not cause  the
           overall test suite to fail.

           There  are two ways to use this. The first is to use a codeblock, and the TODO will only apply to the
           codeblock.

               ok(1, "before"); # Not TODO

               todo 'this will fail' =&gt; sub {
                   # This is TODO, as is any other test in this block.
                   ok(0, "blah");
               };

               ok(1, "after"); # Not TODO

           The other way is to use a scoped variable. TODO will end when the variable is  destroyed  or  set  to
           undef.

               ok(1, "before"); # Not TODO

               {
                   my $todo = todo 'this will fail';

                   # This is TODO, as is any other test in this block.
                   ok(0, "blah");
               };

               ok(1, "after"); # Not TODO

           This is the same thing, but without the "{...}" scope.

               ok(1, "before"); # Not TODO

               my $todo = todo 'this will fail';

               ok(0, "blah"); # TODO

               $todo = undef;

               ok(1, "after"); # Not TODO

       skip($why)
       skip($why, $count)
           This  is  used  to  skip some tests. This requires you to wrap your tests in a block labeled "SKIP:".
           This is somewhat magical. If no $count is specified then it  will  issue  a  single  result.  If  you
           specify $count it will issue that many results.

               SKIP: {
                   skip "This will wipe your drive";

                   # This never gets run:
                   ok(!system('sudo rm -rf /'), "Wipe drive");
               }
