</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Roo::Role - Composable role for Test::Roo

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.004

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       A testing role:

           # t/lib/MyTestRole.pm
           package MyTestRole;
           use Test::Roo::Role; # loads Moo::Role and Test::More

           requires 'class';

           test 'object creation' =&gt; sub {
               my $self = shift;
               require_ok( $self-&gt;class );
               my $obj  = new_ok( $self-&gt;class );
           };

           1;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module defines test behaviors as a Moo::Role.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Importing Test::Roo::Role also loads Moo::Role (which gives you strictures with fatal warnings and other
       goodies).

       Importing also loads Test::More.  Any import arguments are passed through to Test::More's "import"
       method.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>and</b> <b>requiring</b> <b>fixtures</b>
       You can create fixtures with normal Moo syntax.  You can even make them lazy if you want and require the
       composing class to provide the builder:

           has fixture =&gt; (
               is =&gt; 'lazy'
           );

           requires '_build_fixture';

       Because this is a Moo::Role, you can require any method you like, not just builders.

       See Moo::Role and Role::Tiny for everything you can do with roles.

   <b>Setup</b> <b>and</b> <b>teardown</b>
       You can add method modifiers around the "setup" and "teardown" methods and these will be run before tests
       begin and after tests finish (respectively).

           before  setup     =&gt; sub { ... };

           after   teardown  =&gt; sub { ... };

       You can also add method modifiers around "each_test", which will be run before and after <b>every</b> individual
       test.  You could use these to prepare or reset a fixture.

           has fixture =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'lazy, clearer =&gt; 1, predicate =&gt; 1 );

           after  each_test =&gt; sub { shift-&gt;clear_fixture };

       Roles may also modify "setup", "teardown", and "each_test", so the order that modifiers will be called
       will depend on when roles are composed.  Be careful with "each_test", though, because the global effect
       may make composition more fragile.

       You can call test functions in modifiers. For example, you could confirm that something has been set up
       or cleaned up.

           before each_test =&gt; sub { ok( ! shift-&gt;has_fixture ) };

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTED</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Loading Test::Roo::Role exports a single subroutine into the calling package to declare tests.

   <b>test</b>
           test $label =&gt; sub { ... };

       The "test" function adds a subtest.  The code reference will be called with the test object as its only
       argument.

       Tests are run in the order declared, so the order of tests from roles will depend on when they are
       composed relative to other test declarations.
