       Test::Assertions::TestScript - Base for test scripts

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Test::Assertions::TestScript;
               use Module::To::Test qw( frobnicate );

               ASSERT(frobnicate(),"Frobnicate returns true");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Assertions::TestScript provides a base for writing test scripts. It performs some common actions
       such as setting up the @INC path and parsing command-line options, specifically:

       •   The lib and t/lib directories are added to @INC.

       •   The current directory is changed to the directory the script is in.

       •   Test script command-line options are parsed. (See "COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS")

       •   The test set of functions from Test::Assertions are imported into your test script.

       Test::Assertions::TestScript makes certain assumptions about the filesystem layout of your project:

       •   Modules that you are testing are in the lib directory of your project.

       •   Test scripts are in the t directory.

       •   There may also be a t/lib directory for any modules written for the test process.

       Test::Assertions::TestScript should be "use"d <b>before</b> any modules that you intend to test.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options  can  be supplied to the import function. These should be placed after the "use" or "import". For
       example

               use Test::Assertions::TestScript( tests =&gt; 10, options =&gt; { 'b', \$opt_b })

       The following options are defined:

       tests
           The  number  of  tests  to  pass  to  "plan  tests"  from  Test::Assertions.   For  example  to  tell
           Test::Assertions::TestScript that the script contains 42 tests:

             use Test::Assertions::TestScript tests =&gt; 42;

       options
           A  hashref  of  additional  options  to  capture via Getopt::Long.  The "options" import parameter is
           passed verbatim to GetOptions, so something along the following lines is required in order to capture
           the "-b" command line option:

             use Test::Assertions::TestScript( options =&gt; { 'b' =&gt; \$opt_b } );

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A script based on Test::Assertions::TestScript will detect the following command line options.

       -t  Shallow tracing. Traces are "print"ed and AutoImport is turned on.

       -T  Deep tracing. Traces are "print"ed and AutoImport is turned on.

       --trace-module=MODULE
           Imports tracing into MODULE specifically. Can be specified multiple times.

       -s  Save generated output. You will need to write the actual code to do this in your testscript, but  you
           can inspect $Test::Assertions::TestScript::SAVE_OUTPUT to see whether this argument was given.

       Be aware that all other command line options will be disregarded unless the "options" import parameter is
       used to capture them.
