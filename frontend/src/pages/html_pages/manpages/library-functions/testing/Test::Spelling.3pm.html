</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Spelling - Check for spelling errors in POD files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Place a file, "pod-spell.t" in your distribution's "xt/author" directory:

           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Test::More;

           use Test::Spelling;
           use Pod::Wordlist;

           add_stopwords(&lt;DATA&gt;);
           all_pod_files_spelling_ok( qw( bin lib ) );

           __DATA__
           SomeBizarreWord
           YetAnotherBIzarreWord

       Or, you can gate the spelling test with the environment variable "AUTHOR_TESTING":

           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Test::More;

           BEGIN {
               plan skip_all =&gt; "Spelling tests only for authors"
                   unless $ENV{AUTHOR_TESTING};
           }

           use Test::Spelling;
           use Pod::Wordlist;

           all_pod_files_spelling_ok();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Spelling lets you check the spelling of a "POD" file, and report its results in standard Test::More
       fashion. This module requires a spellcheck program such as Hunspell &lt;<a href="http://hunspell.github.io/">http://hunspell.github.io/</a>&gt;, <u>aspell</u>,
       <u>spell</u>, or, <u>ispell</u>. We suggest using Hunspell.

           use Test::Spelling;
           pod_file_spelling_ok('lib/Foo/Bar.pm', 'POD file spelling OK');

       Note that it is a bad idea to run spelling tests during an ordinary CPAN distribution install, or in a
       package that will run in an uncontrolled environment. There is no way of predicting whether the word list
       or spellcheck program used will give the same results. You <b>can</b> include the test in your distribution, but
       be sure to run it only for authors of the module by guarding it in a "skip_all unless
       $ENV{AUTHOR_TESTING}" clause, or by putting the test in your distribution's <u>xt/author</u> directory. Anyway,
       people installing your module really do not need to run such tests, as it is unlikely that the
       documentation will acquire typos while in transit.

       You can add your own stop words, which are words that should be ignored by the spell check, like so:

           add_stopwords(qw(asdf thiswordiscorrect));

       Adding stop words in this fashion affects all files checked for the remainder of the test script. See
       Pod::Spell (which this module is built upon) for a variety of ways to add per-file stop words to each .pm
       file.

       If you have a lot of stop words, it's useful to put them in your test file's "DATA" section like so:

           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Test::More;

           use Test::Spelling;
           use Pod::Wordlist;

           add_stopwords(&lt;DATA&gt;);
           all_pod_files_spelling_ok();

           __DATA__
           folksonomy
           Jifty
           Zakirov

       To maintain backwards compatibility, comment markers and some whitespace are ignored. In the near future,
       the preprocessing we do on the arguments to "add_stopwords" in Test::Spelling will be changed and
       documented properly.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Spelling makes the following methods available.

   <b>add_stopwords</b>
         add_stopwords(@words);
         add_stopwords(&lt;DATA&gt;); # pull in stop words from the DATA section

       Add words that should be skipped by the spell checker. Note that Pod::Spell already skips words believed
       to be code, such as everything in verbatim (indented) blocks and code marked up with ""..."", as well as
       some common Perl jargon.

   <b>all_pod_files</b>
         all_pod_files();
         all_pod_files(@list_of_directories);

       Returns a list of all the Perl files in each directory and its subdirectories, recursively. If no
       directories are passed, it defaults to <u>blib</u> if <u>blib</u> exists, or else <u>lib</u> if not. Skips any files in <u>CVS</u> or
       <u>.svn</u> directories.

       A Perl file is:

       •   Any file that ends in <u>.PL</u>, <u>.pl</u>, <u>.plx</u>, <u>.pm</u>, <u>.pod</u> or <u>.t</u>.

       •   Any file that has a first line with a shebang and "perl" on it.

       Furthermore,  files  for  which  the  filter  set  by  "set_pod_file_filter" return false are skipped. By
       default, this filter passes everything through.

       The order of the files returned is machine-dependent.  If you want them sorted, you'll have to sort  them
       yourself.

   <b>all_pod_files_spelling_ok</b>
         all_pod_files_spelling_ok(@list_of_files);
         all_pod_files_spelling_ok(@list_of_directories);

       Checks  all  the  files  for  "POD"  spelling.  It  gathers  "all_pod_files"  in  Test::Spelling  on each
       file/directory, and declares a "plan" in Test::More for you (one test for each file),  so  you  must  not
       call "plan" yourself.

       If  @files  is  empty,  the function finds all "POD" files in the <u>blib</u> directory if it exists, or the <u>lib</u>
       directory if it does not. A "POD" file is one that ends with <u>.pod</u>, <u>.pl</u>, <u>.plx</u>, or <u>.pm</u>; or any  file  where
       the first line looks like a perl shebang line.

       If there is no working spellchecker (determined by &lt;Test:Spelling/"has_working_spellchecker"&gt;), this test
       will issue a "skip all" directive.

       If you're testing a distribution, just create an <u>xt/author/pod-spell.t</u> with the code in the "SYNOPSIS".

       Returns  true if every "POD" file has correct spelling, or false if any of them fail.  This function will
       show any spelling errors as diagnostics.

       * <b>NOTE:</b> This only tests using bytes. This is not decoded content, etc. Do not expect this  to  work  with
       Unicode content, for example. This uses an open with no layers and no decoding.

   <b>get_pod_parser</b>
         # a Pod::Spell -like object
         my $object = get_pod_parser();

       Get  the  object  we're  using to parse the "POD". A new Pod::Spell object should be used for every file.
       People providing custom parsers will have to do this themselves.

   <b>has_working_spellchecker</b>
         my $cmd = has_working_spellchecker;

       "has_working_spellchecker" will return "undef" if there is no working spellchecker, or a true value  (the
       spellchecker  command itself) if there is.  The module performs a dry-run to determine whether any of the
       spellcheckers it can will use work on the current system. You can use this to skip tests if there  is  no
       spellchecker. Note that "all_pod_files_spelling_ok" will do this for you.

       A  full  list  of  spellcheckers  which  this  method  might  test  can  be  found  in  the source of the
       "spellchecker_candidates" method.

   <b>pod_file_spelling_ok</b>
         pod_file_spelling_ok('/path/to/Foo.pm');
         pod_file_spelling_ok('/path/to/Foo.pm', 'Foo is well spelled!');

       "pod_file_spelling_ok" will test that the given "POD" file has no spelling errors.

       When it fails, "pod_file_spelling_ok" will show any spelling errors as diagnostics.

       The optional second argument is the name of the test.  If it is omitted, "pod_file_spelling_ok" chooses a
       default test name "POD spelling for $filename".

       * <b>NOTE:</b> This only tests using bytes. This is not decoded content, etc. Do not expect this  to  work  with
       Unicode content, for example. This uses an open with no layers and no decoding.

   <b>set_pod_file_filter</b>
           # code ref
           set_pod_file_filter(sub {
               my $filename = shift;
               return 0 if $filename =~ /_ja.pod$/; # skip Japanese translations
               return 1;
           });

       If  your  project  has  "POD" documents written in languages other than English, then obviously you don't
       want to be running a spellchecker on every Perl file.  "set_pod_file_filter" lets you  filter  out  files
       returned from "all_pod_files" (and hence, the documents tested by "all_pod_files_spelling_ok").

   <b>set_pod_parser</b>
         my $object = Pod::Spell-&gt;new();
         set_pod_parser($object);

       By  default  Pod::Spell  is  used to generate text suitable for spellchecking from the input POD.  If you
       want to use a different parser, perhaps a customized subclass of Pod::Spell, call  "set_pod_parser"  with
       an  object  that is-a Pod::Parser.  Be sure to create a fresh parser object for each file (don't use this
       with "all_pod_files_spelling_ok").

   <b>set_spell_cmd</b>
         set_spell_cmd('hunspell -l'); # current preferred
         set_spell_cmd('aspell list');
         set_spell_cmd('spell');
         set_spell_cmd('ispell -l');

       If you want to force this module to use a particular spellchecker, then you can specify  which  one  with
       "set_spell_cmd". This is useful to ensure a more consistent lexicon between developers, or if you have an
       unusual  environment.   Any  command  that takes text from standard input and prints a list of misspelled
       words, one per line, to standard output will do.
