</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Compile::Internal - Assert that your Perl files compile OK.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Test::Compile::Internal;
           my $test = Test::Compile::Internal-&gt;new();
           $test-&gt;all_files_ok();
           $test-&gt;done_testing();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Test::Compile::Internal" is an object oriented tool for testing whether your perl files compile.

       It is primarily to provide the inner workings of "Test::Compile", but it can also be used directly to
       test a CPAN distribution.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new()
           A basic constructor, nothing special.

       all_files_ok(@search)
           Looks for perl files and tests them all for compilation errors.

           If  @search  is  defined then it is taken as an array of files or directories to be searched for perl
           files, otherwise it searches the default locations you'd expect to find perl files in a perl module -
           see "all_pm_files" and "all_pl_files" for details.

       all_pm_files_ok(@search)
           Checks all the perl module files it can find for compilation errors.

           If @search is defined then it is taken as an array of files or directories to be  searched  for  perl
           files, otherwise it searches the default locations you'd expect to find perl files in a perl module -
           see "all_pm_files" for details.

       all_pl_files_ok(@search)
           Checks all the perl program files it can find for compilation errors.

           If  @search  is  defined  then  it is taken as an array of directories to be searched for perl files,
           otherwise it searches some default locations - see "all_pl_files".

       verbose($verbose)
           An accessor to get/set the verbosity.  The default value (undef)  will  suppress  output  unless  the
           compilation fails.  This is probably what you want.

           If  "verbose"  is  set  to  true,  you'll  get  the  output from 'perl -c'. If it's set to false, all
           diagnostic output is suppressed.

       all_pm_files(@search)
           Searches for and returns a list of perl module files - that is, files with a <u>.pm</u> extension.

           If you provide @search, it'll use that as a list of files to process, or directories  to  search  for
           perl modules.

           If  you  don't  provide  "search",  it'll  search for perl modules in the <u>blib/lib</u> directory (if that
           directory exists). Otherwise it'll search the <u>lib</u> directory.

           Skips any files in <u>CVS</u>, <u>.svn</u>, or <u>.git</u> directories.

       all_pl_files(@search)
           Searches for and returns a list of perl script files - that is, any files that  either  have  a  case
           insensitive <u>.pl</u>, <u>.psgi</u> extension, or have no extension but have a perl shebang line.

           If  you  provide  @search, it'll use that as a list of files to process, or directories to search for
           perl scripts.

           If you don't provide "search", it'll search for  perl  scripts  in  the  <u>blib/script/</u>  and  <u>blib/bin/</u>
           directories if <u>blib</u> exists, otherwise it'll search the <u>script/</u> and <u>bin/</u> directories

           Skips any files in <u>CVS</u>, <u>.svn</u>, or <u>.git</u> directories.

       pl_file_compiles($file)
           Returns true if $file compiles as a perl script.

       pm_file_compiles($file)
           Returns true if $file compiles as a perl module.

</pre><h4><b>TEST</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "Test::Compile::Internal"  encapsulates  a  "Test::Builder"  object,  and  provides access to some of its
       methods.

       "ok($test, $name)"
           Your basic test. Pass if $test is true, fail if $test is false. Just like "Test::Simple"'s ok().

       done_testing()
           Declares that you got to the end of your test plan, no more tests will be run after this point.

       "plan(tests =&gt; $count)"
           Defines how many tests you plan to run.

       diag(@msgs)
           Prints out the given @msgs. Like print, arguments are simply appended together.

           Output will be indented and marked with a # so as not to interfere with test output. A  newline  will
           be put on the end if there isn't one already.

           We encourage using this rather than calling print directly.

       skip($reason)
           Skips the current test, reporting the $reason.

       skip_all($reason)
           Skips all the tests, using the given $reason. Exits immediately with 0.

       Test::Strict provides functions to ensure your perl files compile, with the  added  bonus  that  it  will
       check you have used strict in all your files.

       Test::LoadAllModules just handles modules, not script files, but has more fine-grained control.
