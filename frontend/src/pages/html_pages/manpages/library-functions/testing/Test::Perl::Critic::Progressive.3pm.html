</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive - Gradually enforce coding standards.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To test one or more files, and/or all files in one or more directories:

         use Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive qw( progressive_critic_ok );
         progressive_critic_ok($file1, $file2, $dir1, $dir2);

       To test all Perl files in a distribution:

         use Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive qw( progressive_critic_ok );
         progressive_critic_ok();

       Recommended usage for public CPAN distributions:

         use strict;
         use warnings;
         use Test::More;

         eval { require Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive };
         plan skip_all =&gt; 'T::P::C::Progressive required for this test' if $@;

         Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive::progressive_critic_ok();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Applying coding standards to large amounts of legacy code is a daunting task.  Often times, legacy code
       is so non-compliant that it seems downright impossible.  But, if you consistently chip away at the
       problem, you will eventually succeed!  Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive uses the Perl::Critic engine to
       prevent further deterioration of your code and <b>gradually</b> steer it towards conforming with your chosen
       coding standards.

       The most effective way to use Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive is as a unit test that is run under a
       continuous-integration system like CruiseControl or AntHill.  Each time a developer commits changes to
       the code, this test will fail and the build will break unless it has the same (or fewer) Perl::Critic
       violations than the last successful test.

       See the "NOTES" for more details about how this test works.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       All of the following subroutines can be exported upon request.  Or you can export all of them at once
       using the ':all' tag.

       " progressive_critic_ok(@FILES [, @DIRECTORIES ]) "
       " progressive_critic_ok() "
           Uses  Perl::Critic  to analyze each of the given @FILES, and/or all Perl files beneath the given list
           of @DIRECTORIES.  If no arguments are given, it analyzes all the Perl files in the  <u>blib/</u>  directory.
           If the <u>blib/</u> directory does not exist, then it tries the <u>lib/</u>, <u>bin/</u>, <u>script/</u>, and <u>scripts/</u> directory.
           The  results  of  the analysis will be stored as <u>.perlcritic-history</u> in the same directory where your
           test script is located.

           The first time you run this test, it will always pass.  But on each subsequent  run,  the  test  will
           pass  only  if the number of violations found <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> the number of violations found
           during the last passing test.  If it does pass, then the history file will be updated  with  the  new
           analysis  results.   Once  all  the violations are removed from the code, this test will always pass,
           unless a new violation is introduced.

           This subroutine emits its own Test::More plan, so you do not need to specify an  expected  number  of
           tests yourself.

       " get_history_file() "
       " set_history_file($FILE) "
           These   functions   get   or   set   the   full   path   to   the   history   file.   This  is  where
           Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive will store the results of each passing analysis.  If the  $FILE  does
           not  exist,  it  will  be  created anew.  The default is "$Bin/.perlcritic-history" where $Bin is the
           directory that the calling test script is located in.

       " get_total_step_size() "
       " set_total_step_size($INTEGER) "
           These functions get or set the minimum acceptable decrease in the <b>total</b> number of violations  between
           each  test.   The  default  value  is  zero,  which  means  that  you  are not required to remove any
           violations, but you are also not allowed to add any.  If you set the step size to a positive  number,
           the test will require you to remove $INTEGER violations each time the test is run.  In this case, the
           particular type of violation that you eliminate doesn't matter.  The larger the step size, the faster
           you'll have to eliminate violations.

       " get_step_size_per_policy() "
       " set_step_size_per_policy(%ARGS) "
           These  functions get or set the minimum acceptable decrease in the number of violations of a <b>specific</b>
           <b>policy</b> between each test.  The %ARGS should be "$POLICY_NAME =&gt; $INTEGER" pairs, like this:

             my %step_sizes = (
                'ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitLeadingZeros'  =&gt;  2,
                'Variables::ProhibitConditionalDeclarations'  =&gt;  1,
                'InputOutput::ProhibitTwoArgOpen'             =&gt;  3,
             );

             set_step_size_per_policy( %step_sizes );
             progressive_critic_ok();

           The default step size for any given Policy is zero, which means that you are not required  to  remove
           any  violations,  but  you  are also not allowed to add any.  But if you wish to focus on eliminating
           certain types of violations, then increasing the per-policy step size will force you to <b>decrease</b>  the
           number of violations of that particular Policy, while ignoring other types of violations.  The larger
           the step size, the faster you'll have to eliminate violations.

       " get_critic_args() "
       " set_critic_args(%ARGS) "
           These    functions    get    or   set   the   arguments   given   to   Perl::Critic.    By   default,
           Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive invokes Perl::Critic with its default configuration.  But if you have
           developed your code against a custom Perl::Critic configuration, you will want to configure this test
           to do the same.

           Any %ARGS given to "set_critic_args" will be passed directly into the Perl::Critic  constructor.   So
           if   you   have   developed   your   code   using   a  custom  <u>.perlcriticrc</u>  file,  you  can  direct
           Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive to use a custom file too.

             use Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive ( ':all' );

             set_critic_args(-profile =&gt; 't/perlcriticrc);
             progressive_critic_ok();

           Now place a copy of your  own  <u>.perlcriticrc</u>  file  in  the  distribution  as  <u>t/perlcriticrc</u>.   Now,
           "progressive_critic_ok"  will  use  this  same  Perl::Critic  configuration.   See  the  Perl::Critic
           documentation for details on the <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file format.

           Any argument that is supported by the Perl::Critic constructor can be passed through this  interface.
           For example, you can also set the minimum severity level, or include &amp; exclude specific policies like
           this:

             use Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive ( ':all' );

             set_critic_args( -severity =&gt; 2, -exclude =&gt; ['MixedCaseVars'] );
             progressive_critic_ok();

           See the Perl::Critic documentation for complete details on its options and arguments.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  test  is evaluated in two ways. First, the number of violations for each Policy must be <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b>
       <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> the number of the violations found during the last passing test, minus the step  size  <b>for</b>  <b>that</b>
       <b>Policy</b>.  Second, the total number of violations must be <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> the total number of violations
       found  during  the  last  passing  test,  minus  the  <b>total</b>  step  size.   This  prevents you from simply
       substituting one kind of violation for another.

       You can use the total step size and the per-policy step size at the same time.  For example, you can  set
       the    total    step    size    to    5,    and    set    the    per-policy    step    size    for    the
       "TestingAndDebugging::RequireStrictures" Policy to 3.  In which case, you'll have to remove 5  violations
       between each test, but 3 of them must be violations of "TestingAndDebugging::RequireStrictures".

       Over    time,    you'll    probably    add    new    Policies   to   your   Perl::Critic   setup.    When
       Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive uses a Policy for the first time, any newly discovered violations of that
       Policy will not be considered in the test.  However, they will be considered in subsequent tests.

       If you are building a CPAN distribution, you'll want to add <u>^t/.perlcritic-history$</u> to the  <u>MANIFEST.SKIP</u>
       file.   And  if  you  are using a revision control system like CVS or Subversion, you'll probably want to
       configure it to ignore the <u>t/.perlcritic-history</u> file as well.
