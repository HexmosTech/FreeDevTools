</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ur test run - run one or more test scripts

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        # run everything in a given namespace
        cd my_sandbox/TheNamespace
        ur test run --recurse

        # run only selected tests
        cd my_sandbox/TheNamespace
        ur test run My/Module.t Another/Module.t t/foo.t t/bar.t

        # run only tests which load the TheNamespace::DNA module
        cd my_sandbox/TheNamespace
        ur test run --cover TheNamespace/DNA.pm

        # run only tests which cover the changes you have in Subversion
        cd my_sandbox/TheNamespace
        ur test run --cover-svn-changes

        # run 5 tests in parallel as jobs scheduled via LSF
        cd my_sandbox/TheNamespace
         ur test run --lsf --jobs 5

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Runs a test harness around automated test cases, like "make test" in a make-oriented software
       distrbution, and similar to "prove" run in bulk.

       When run w/o parameters, it looks for "t" directory in the current working directory, and runs ALL tests
       under that directory.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --recurse
            Run all tests in the current directory, and in sub-directories.  Without
            --recurse, it will first recursively search for directories named 't' under
            the current directory, and then recursively seatch for *.t files under those
            directories.

       --long
            Include "long" tests, which are otherwise skipped in test harness execution

       -v
            Be verbose, meaning that individual cases will appear instead of just a full-script summary

       --cover My/Module.pm
            Looks in a special sqlite database which is updated by the cron which runs tests,
            to find all tests which load My/Module.pm at some point before they exit.  Only
            these tests will be run.

           * you will still need the --long flag to run long tests.

           * if you specify tests on the command-line, only tests in both lists will run

           * this can be specified multiple times

       --cover-TOOL-changes
            TOOL can be svn, svk, or cvs.

            The script will run either "svn status", "svk status", or "cvs -q up" on a parent
            directory with "GSC" in it, and get all of the changes in your perl_modules trunk.
            It will behave as though those modules were listed as individual --cover options.

       --lsf
            Tests should not be run locally, instead they are submitted as jobs to the
            LSF cluster with bsub.

       --lsf-params
            Parameters given to bsub when sceduling jobs.  The default is
            "-q short -R select[type==LINUX64]"

       --jobs &lt;number&gt;
            This many tests should be run in parallel.  If --lsf is also specified, then
            these parallel tests will be submitted as LSF jobs.

</pre><h4><b>PENDING</b> <b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       automatic remote execution for tests requiring a distinct hardware platform
       logging profiling and coverage metrics with each test
