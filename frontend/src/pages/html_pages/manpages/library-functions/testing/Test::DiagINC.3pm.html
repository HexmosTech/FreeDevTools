       Test::DiagINC - List modules and versions loaded if tests fail

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.010

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # preferably load before anything else
           use if $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING}, 'Test::DiagINC';
           use Test::More;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Assuming you shipped your module to CPAN with working tests, test failures from CPAN Testers
       &lt;<a href="http://www.cpantesters.org/">http://www.cpantesters.org/</a>&gt; might be due to platform issues, Perl version issues or problems with
       dependencies.  This module helps you diagnose deep dependency problems by showing you exactly what
       modules and versions were loaded during a test run.

       When this module is loaded, it sets up an "END" block that will take action if the program is about to
       exit with a non-zero exit code or if $test_builder-&gt;is_passing is false by the time the "END" block is
       reached.  If that happens, this module prints out the names and version numbers of non-local modules
       appearing in %INC at the end of the test.

       For example:

           $ perl -MTest::DiagINC -MTest::More -e 'fail("meh"); done_testing'
           not ok 1 - meh
           #   Failed test 'meh'
           #   at -e line 1.
           1..1
           # Looks like you failed 1 test of 1.
           # Listing modules and versions from %INC
           #   5.018002 Config
           #       5.68 Exporter
           #       5.68 Exporter::Heavy
           #       1.07 PerlIO
           #       0.98 Test::Builder
           #       0.98 Test::Builder::Module
           #      0.003 Test::DiagINC
           #       0.98 Test::More
           #       1.22 overload
           #       0.02 overloading
           #       1.07 strict
           #       1.03 vars
           #       1.18 warnings
           #       1.02 warnings::register

       This module deliberately does not load <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>modules</b> during runtime, instead delaying all loads until
       it needs to generate a failure report in its "END" block. The only exception is loading strict and
       warnings for self-check <b>if</b> <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> "RELEASE_TESTING" is true. Therefore an empty invocation will look
       like this:

           $ perl -MTest::DiagINC -e '<a href="../man1/exit.1.html">exit</a>(1)'
           # Listing modules from %INC
           #  0.003 Test::DiagINC

       <b>NOTE</b>:  Because this module uses an "END" block, it is a good idea to load it as early as possible, so the
       "END" block it installs will execute as <b>late</b> as possible (see perlmod for details on how this works).
       While this module does employ some cleverness to work around load order, it is still a heuristic and is
       no substitute to loading this module early. A notable side-effect is when a module is loaded in an "END"
       block executing <b>after</b> the one installed by this library: such modules will be "invisible" to us and will
       not be reported as part of the diagnostic report.

       Modules that appear to be sourced from below the current directory when "Test::DiagINC" was loaded will
       be excluded from the report (e.g. excludes local modules from "./", "lib/", "t/lib", and so on).

       The heuristic of searching %INC for loaded modules may fail if the module path loaded does not map to a
       package within the module file.

       If "Test::More" is loaded, the output will go via the "diag" function.  Otherwise, it will just be sent
       to STDERR.
