</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Fixme - Check code for FIXMEs.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.17

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        # In a test script like 't/test-fixme.t'
        use Test::Fixme;
        run_tests();

        # You can also tailor the behaviour.
        use Test::Fixme;
        run_tests( where    =&gt; 'lib',      # where to find files to check
                   match    =&gt; 'TODO',     # what to check for
                   skip_all =&gt; $ENV{SKIP}  # should all tests be skipped
        );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When coding it is common to come up against problems that need to be addressed but that are not a big
       deal at the moment. What generally happens is that the coder adds comments like:

        # FIXME - what about windows that are bigger than the screen?

        # FIXME - add checking of user privileges here.

       Test::Fixme allows you to add a test file that ensures that none of these get forgotten in the module.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>run_tests</b>
       By default run_tests will search for 'FIXME' in all the files it can find in the project. You can change
       these defaults by using 'where' or 'match' as follows:

        run_tests( where =&gt; 'lib', # just check the modules.
                   match =&gt; 'TODO' # look for things that are not done yet.
        );

       where
           Specifies  where to search for files.  This can be a scalar containing a single directory name, or it
           can be a list reference containing multiple directory names.

       match
           Expression to search for within the files.  This may be a simple string,  or  a  qr//-quoted  regular
           expression.  For example:

            match =&gt; qr/[T]ODO|[F]IXME|[B]UG/,

       filename_match
           Expression to filter file names.  This should be a qr//-quoted regular expression.  For example:

            match =&gt; qr/\.(:pm|pl)$/,

           would only match .pm and .pl files under your specified directory.

       manifest
           Specifies  the  name of your MANIFEST file which will be used as the list of files to test instead of
           <u>where</u> or <u>filename_match</u>.

            manifest =&gt; 'MANIFEST',

       warn
           Do not fail when a FIXME or other pattern is matched.  Tests that would have been failures will still
           issue a diagnostic that will be viewed when you run "prove" without "-v",  "make  test"  or  "./Build
           test".

       format
           Specifies format to be used for display of pattern matches.

           original
               The original and currently default format looks something like this:

                # File: './lib/Test/Fixme.pm'
                #     16      # ABSTRACT: Check code for FIXMEs.
                #     25          $args{match} = 'FIXME' unless defined $args{match} &amp;&amp; length $args{match};
                #     28          $args{format} ||= $ENV{TEST_FIXME_FORMAT};
                #     228      # FIXME - what about windows that are bigger than the screen?
                #     230      # FIXME - add checking of user privileges here.
                #     239     By default run_tests will search for 'FIXME' in all the files it can
                #     280     Do not fail when a FIXME or other pattern is matched.  Tests that would
                #     288     If you want to match something other than 'FIXME' then you may find
                #     296      run_tests( skip_all =&gt; $ENV{SKIP_TEST_FIXME} );
                #     303     L&lt;Devel::FIXME&gt;

               With the line numbers on the left and the offending text on the right.

           perl
               The "perl" format is that used by Perl itself to report warnings and errors.

                # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 16:
                #  # ABSTRACT: Check code for FIXMEs.
                # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 25:
                #      $args{match} = 'FIXME' unless defined $args{match} &amp;&amp; length $args{match};
                # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 28:
                #      $args{format} ||= $ENV{TEST_FIXME_FORMAT};
                # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 228:
                #   # FIXME - what about windows that are bigger than the screen?
                # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 230:
                #   # FIXME - add checking of user privileges here.
                # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 239:
                #  By default run_tests will search for 'FIXME' in all the files it can
                # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 280:
                #  Do not fail when a FIXME or other pattern is matched.  Tests that would
                # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 288:
                #  If you want to match something other than 'FIXME' then you may find
                # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 296:
                #   run_tests( skip_all =&gt; $ENV{SKIP_TEST_FIXME} );
                # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 303:
                #  L&lt;Devel::FIXME&gt;

               For  files  that  contain  many offending patterns it may be a bit harder to read for humans, but
               easier to parse for IDEs.

           You may also use the "TEST_FIXME_FORMAT" environment variable to override either the default  or  the
           value specified in the test file.

</pre><h4><b>HINTS</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  want  to match something other than 'FIXME' then you may find that the test file itself is being
       caught. Try doing this:

        run_tests( match =&gt; 'TO'.'DO' );

       You may also wish to suppress the tests - try this:

        use Test::Fixme;
        run_tests( skip_all =&gt; $ENV{SKIP_TEST_FIXME} );

       You can only run run_tests once per file. Please use several test  files  if  you  want  to  run  several
       different tests.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       This  module  is fully supported back to Perl 5.8.1.  It may work on 5.8.0.  It should work on Perl 5.6.x
       and I may even test on 5.6.2.  I will accept patches to maintain compatibility for such older Perls,  but
       you may need to fix it on 5.6.x / 5.8.0 and send me a patch.

       Dave O'Neill added support for 'filename_match' and also being able to pass a list of several directories
       in the 'where' argument. Many thanks.
