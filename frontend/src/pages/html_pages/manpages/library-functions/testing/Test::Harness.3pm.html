</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Harness - Run Perl standard test scripts with statistics

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 3.52

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Test::Harness;

         runtests(@test_files);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Although, for historical reasons, the Test::Harness distribution takes its name from this module it now
       exists only to provide TAP::Harness with an interface that is somewhat backwards compatible with
       Test::Harness 2.xx. If you're writing new code consider using TAP::Harness directly instead.

       Emulation is provided for "runtests" and "execute_tests" but the pluggable 'Straps' interface that
       previous versions of Test::Harness supported is not reproduced here. Straps is now available as a stand
       alone module: Test::Harness::Straps.

       See TAP::Parser, TAP::Harness for the main documentation for this distribution.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following functions are available.

   <b>runtests(</b> <b>@test_files</b> <b>)</b>
       This runs all the given <u>@test_files</u> and divines whether they passed or failed based on their output to
       STDOUT (details above).  It prints out each individual test which failed along with a summary report and
       a how long it all took.

       It returns true if everything was ok.  Otherwise it will die() with one of the messages in the
       DIAGNOSTICS section.

   <b>execute_tests(</b> <b>tests</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>\@test_files,</b> <b>out</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>\*FH</b> <b>)</b>
       Runs all the given @test_files (just like runtests()) but doesn't generate the final report.  During
       testing, progress information will be written to the currently selected output filehandle (usually
       "STDOUT"), or to the filehandle given by the "out" parameter.  The <u>out</u> is optional.

       Returns a list of two values, $total and $failed, describing the results.  $total is a hash ref summary
       of all the tests run.  Its keys and values are this:

           bonus           Number of individual todo tests unexpectedly passed
           max             Number of individual tests ran
           ok              Number of individual tests passed
           sub_skipped     Number of individual tests skipped
           todo            Number of individual todo tests

           files           Number of test files ran
           good            Number of test files passed
           bad             Number of test files failed
           tests           Number of test files originally given
           skipped         Number of test files skipped

       If "$total-&gt;{bad} == 0" and "$total-&gt;{max} &gt; 0", you've got a successful test.

       $failed is a hash ref of all the test scripts that failed.  Each key is the name of a test script, each
       value is another hash representing how that script failed.  Its keys are these:

           name        Name of the test which failed
           estat       Script's exit value
           wstat       Script's wait status
           max         Number of individual tests
           failed      Number which failed
           canon       List of tests which failed (as string).

       $failed should be empty if everything passed.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT</b></h4><pre>
       &amp;runtests is exported by "Test::Harness" by default.

       &amp;execute_tests, $verbose, $switches and $debug are exported upon request.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b> <b>THAT</b> <b>TAP::HARNESS::COMPATIBLE</b> <b>SETS</b></h4><pre>
       "Test::Harness" sets these before executing the individual tests.

       "HARNESS_ACTIVE"
           This is set to a true value.  It allows the tests to determine if they are being executed through the
           harness or by any other means.

       "HARNESS_VERSION"
           This is the version of "Test::Harness".

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b> <b>THAT</b> <b>AFFECT</b> <b>TEST::HARNESS</b></h4><pre>
       "HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES"
           Setting this adds perl command line switches to each test file run.

           For       example,       "HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES=-T"      will      turn      on      taint      mode.
           "HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES=-MDevel::Cover" will run "Devel::Cover" for each test.

           "-w" is always set.  You can turn this off in the test with "BEGIN { $^W = 0 }".

       "HARNESS_TIMER"
           Setting this to true will make the harness display the number of milliseconds each  test  took.   You
           can also use <u>prove</u>'s "--timer" switch.

       "HARNESS_VERBOSE"
           If   true,   "Test::Harness"  will  output  the  verbose  results  of  running  its  tests.   Setting
           $Test::Harness::verbose will override this, or you can use the "-v" switch in the <u>prove</u> utility.

       "HARNESS_OPTIONS"
           Provide additional options to the harness. Currently supported options are:

           "j&lt;n&gt;"
               Run &lt;n&gt; (default 9) parallel jobs.

           "c" Try to color output. See "new" in TAP::Formatter::Base.

           "a&lt;file.tgz&gt;"
               Will use TAP::Harness::Archive as the harness class, and save the TAP to "file.tgz"

           "fPackage-With-Dashes"
               Set the formatter_class of the harness being run. Since the  "HARNESS_OPTIONS"  is  separated  by
               ":", we use "-" instead.

           Multiple options may be separated by colons:

               HARNESS_OPTIONS=j9:c make test

       "HARNESS_SUBCLASS"
           Specifies a TAP::Harness subclass to be used in place of TAP::Harness.

       "HARNESS_SUMMARY_COLOR_SUCCESS"
           Determines  the  Term::ANSIColor  for  the  summary in case it is successful.  This color defaults to
           'green'.

       "HARNESS_SUMMARY_COLOR_FAIL"
           Determines the Term::ANSIColor for the failure in case it is  successful.   This  color  defaults  to
           'red'.

</pre><h4><b>Taint</b> <b>Mode</b></h4><pre>
       Normally  when a Perl program is run in taint mode the contents of the "PERL5LIB" environment variable do
       not appear in @INC.

       Because "PERL5LIB" is often used during testing to add build directories to @INC  "Test::Harness"  passes
       the  names  of  any  directories  found  in  "PERL5LIB"  as  -I  switches. The net effect of this is that
       "PERL5LIB" is honoured even in taint mode.
