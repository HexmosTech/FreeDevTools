</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::CPAN::Meta::Version - Validate CPAN META data against the specification

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Test::CPAN::Meta::Version;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This distribution was written to ensure that a META.yml file, provided with a standard distribution
       uploaded to CPAN, meets the specifications that are slowly being introduced to module uploads, via the
       use of package makers and installers such as ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Build and Module::Install.

       This module is meant to be used together with Test::CPAN::Meta, however the code is self contained enough
       that you can access it directly.

       See CPAN::Meta for further details of the CPAN Meta Specification.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       •   new( data =&gt; $data [, spec =&gt; $version] )

           The constructor must be passed a valid data structure.

           Optionally  you may also provide a specification version. This version is then use to ensure that the
           given data structure meets the respective specification definition. If no  version  is  provided  the
           module will attempt to deduce the appropriate specification version from the data structure itself.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Main</b> <b>Methods</b>
       •   <b>parse()</b>

           Using  the  given  data  structure  provided  with  the  constructor,  attempts to parse and validate
           according to the appropriate specification definition.

           Returns 1 if any errors found, otherwise returns 0.

       •   <b>errors()</b>

           Returns a list of the errors found during parsing.

   <b>Check</b> <b>Methods</b>
       •   check_map($spec,$data)

           Checks whether a map (or hash) part of the data structure conforms to the  appropriate  specification
           definition.

       •   check_list($spec,$data)

           Checks whether a list (or array) part of the data structure conforms to the appropriate specification
           definition.

   <b>Validator</b> <b>Methods</b>
       •   header($self,$key,$value)

           Validates that the YAML header is valid.

           Note: No longer used as we now read the YAML data structure, not the file.

       •   url($self,$key,$value)

           Validates that a given value is in an acceptable URL format

       •   urlspec($self,$key,$value)

           Validates that the URL to a META.yml specification is a known one.

       •   string_or_undef($self,$key,$value)

           Validates  that  the value is either a string or an undef value. Bit of a catchall function for parts
           of the data structure that are completely user defined.

       •   string($self,$key,$value)

           Validates that a string exists for the given key.

       •   file($self,$key,$value)

           Validate that a file is passed for the given key. This may be made more thorough in the  future.  For
           now it acts like \&amp;string.

       •   exversion($self,$key,$value)

           Validates a list of versions, e.g. '&lt;= 5, &gt;=2, ==3, !=4, &gt;1, &lt;6, 0'.

       •   version($self,$key,$value)

           Validates  a  single  version  string.  Versions  of the type '5.8.8' and '0.00_00' are both valid. A
           leading 'v' like 'v1.2.3' is also valid.

       •   boolean($self,$key,$value)

           Validates for a boolean value. Currently these values are '1',  '0',  'true',  'false',  however  the
           latter 2 may be removed.

       •   license($self,$key,$value)

           Validates  that a value is given for the license. Returns 1 if an known license type, or 2 if a value
           is given but the license type is not a recommended one.

       •   resource($self,$key,$value)

           Validates that the given key is in CamelCase, to indicate a user defined keyword.

       •   keyword($self,$key,$value)

           Validates that key is in an acceptable format  for  the  META.yml  specification,  i.e.  any  in  the
           character class [-_a-z].

           For  user  defined  keys,  although  not  explicitly  stated in the specifications (v1.0 - v1.4), the
           convention is to precede the key with a pattern matching qr{\Ax_}i. Following this any character from
           the character class [-_a-zA-Z] can be used.  This  clarification  has  been  added  to  v2.0  of  the
           specification.

       •   identifier($self,$key,$value)

           Validates that key is in an acceptable format for the META.yml specification, for an identifier, i.e.
           any that matches the regular expression qr/[a-z][a-z_]/i.

       •   module($self,$key,$value)

           Validates that a given key is in an acceptable module name format, e.g.  'Test::CPAN::Meta::Version'.

       •   anything($self,$key,$value)

           Usually reserved for user defined structures, allowing them to be considered valid without a need for
           a specification definition for the structure.
