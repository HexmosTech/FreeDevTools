           }
         );

       or

         use Test::Tester;

         use Test::More tests =&gt; 3;
         use Test::MyStyle;

         my ($premature, @results) = run_tests(
           sub {
             is_database_alive("dbname");
           }
         );

         # now use Test::More::like to check the diagnostic output

         like($results[0]-&gt;{diag}, "/^Database ping took \\d+ seconds$"/, "diag");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If you have written a test module based on Test::Builder then Test::Tester allows you to test it with the
       minimum of effort.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>USE</b> <b>(THE</b> <b>EASY</b> <b>WAY)</b></h4><pre>
       From version 0.08 Test::Tester no longer requires you to included anything special in your test modules.
       All you need to do is

         use Test::Tester;

       in your test script <b>before</b> any other Test::Builder based modules and away you go.

       Other modules based on Test::Builder can be used to help with the testing.  In fact you can even use
       functions from your module to test other functions from the same module (while this is possible it is
       probably not a good idea, if your module has bugs, then using it to test itself may give the wrong
       answers).

       The easiest way to test is to do something like

         check_test(
           sub { is_mystyle_eq("this", "that", "not eq") },
           {
             ok =&gt; 0, # we expect the test to fail
             name =&gt; "not eq",
             diag =&gt; "Expected: 'this'\nGot: 'that'",
           }
         );

       this will execute the is_mystyle_eq test, capturing its results and checking that they are what was
       expected.

       You may need to examine the test results in a more flexible way, for example, the diagnostic output may
       be quite long or complex or it may involve something that you cannot predict in advance like a timestamp.
       In this case you can get direct access to the test results:

         my ($premature, @results) = run_tests(
           sub {
             is_database_alive("dbname");
           }
         );

         like($result[0]-&gt;{diag}, "/^Database ping took \\d+ seconds$"/, "diag");

       or

         check_test(
           sub { is_mystyle_qr("this", "that", "not matching") },
           {
             ok =&gt; 0, # we expect the test to fail
             name =&gt; "not matching",
             diag =&gt; qr/Expected: 'this'\s+Got: 'that'/,
           }
         );

       We cannot predict how long the database ping will take so we use Test::More's <b>like()</b> test to check that
       the diagnostic string is of the right form.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>USE</b> <b>(THE</b> <b>HARD</b> <b>WAY)</b></h4><pre>
       <u>This</u> <u>is</u> <u>here</u> <u>for</u> <u>backwards</u> <u>compatibility</u> <u>only</u>

       Make your module use the Test::Tester::Capture object instead of the Test::Builder one. How to do this
       depends on your module but assuming that your module holds the Test::Builder object in $Test and that all
       your test routines access it through $Test then providing a function something like this

         sub set_builder
         {
           $Test = shift;
         }

       should allow your test scripts to do

         Test::YourModule::set_builder(Test::Tester-&gt;capture);

       and after that any tests inside your module will captured.

</pre><h4><b>TEST</b> <b>RESULTS</b></h4><pre>
       The result of each test is captured in a hash. These hashes are the same as the hashes returned by
       Test::Builder-&gt;details but with a couple of extra fields.

       These fields are documented in Test::Builder in the <b>details()</b> function

       ok
         Did the test pass?

       actual_ok
         Did the test really pass? That is, did the pass come from Test::Builder-&gt;<b>ok()</b> or did it pass because it
         was a TODO test?

       name
         The name supplied for the test.

       type
         What kind of test? Possibilities include, skip, todo etc. See Test::Builder for more details.

       reason
         The reason for the skip, todo etc. See Test::Builder for more details.

       These fields are exclusive to Test::Tester.

       diag
         Any  diagnostics  that  were  output for the test. This only includes diagnostics output <b>after</b> the test
         result is declared.

         Note that Test::Builder ensures that any diagnostics end  in  a  \n  and  it  in  earlier  versions  of
         Test::Tester  it  was  essential  that you have the final \n in your expected diagnostics. From version
         0.10 onward, Test::Tester will add the \n if you forgot it. It will not add a \n if you  are  expecting
         no diagnostics. See below for help tracking down hard to find space and tab related problems.

       depth
         This  allows  you to check that your test module is setting the correct value for $Test::Builder::Level
         and thus giving the correct file and line number when a test fails. It  is  calculated  by  looking  at
         <b>caller()</b>  and $Test::Builder::Level. It should count how many subroutines there are before jumping into
         the function you are testing. So for example in

           run_tests( sub { my_test_function("a", "b") } );

         the depth should be 1 and in

           sub deeper { my_test_function("a", "b") }

           run_tests(sub { deeper() });

         depth should be 2, that is 1 for the sub {} and one for <b>deeper()</b>. This might seem a little complex  but
         if  your tests look like the simple examples in this doc then you don't need to worry as the depth will
         always be 1 and that's what Test::Tester expects by default.

         <b>Note</b>: if you do not specify a value for depth in <b>check_test()</b> then it automatically compares it against
         1, if you really want to skip the depth test then pass in undef.

         <b>Note</b>: depth will not be correctly calculated for tests that run from a signal handler or an  END  block
         or anywhere else that hides the call stack.

       Some  of  Test::Tester's  functions return arrays of these hashes, just like Test::Builder-&gt;details. That
       is, the hash for the first test will be array element 1 (not 0). Element 0 will not be a hash it will  be
       a  string  which  contains  any diagnostic output that came before the first test. This should usually be
       empty, if it's not, it means something output diagnostics before any test results showed up.

</pre><h4><b>SPACES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TABS</b></h4><pre>
       Appearances can be deceptive, especially when it comes to emptiness. If  you  are  scratching  your  head
       trying  to  work  out why Test::Tester is saying that your diagnostics are wrong when they look perfectly
       right then the answer is probably whitespace. From version 0.10 on, Test::Tester surrounds  the  expected
       and got diag values with single quotes to make it easier to spot trailing whitespace. So in this example

         # Got diag (5 bytes):
         # 'abcd '
         # Expected diag (4 bytes):
         # 'abcd'

       it  is  quite  clear  that  there  is  a space at the end of the first string.  Another way to solve this
       problem is to use colour and inverse video on an ANSI terminal, see below COLOUR below if you want this.

       Unfortunately this is sometimes not enough, neither  colour  nor  quotes  will  help  you  with  problems
       involving  tabs, other non-printing characters and certain kinds of problems inherent in Unicode. To deal
       with this, you can switch Test::Tester into a mode whereby all "tricky" characters are  shown  as  \{xx}.
       Tricky  characters  are those with ASCII code less than 33 or higher than 126. This makes the output more
       difficult to read but much easier to find subtle differences between strings. To turn on this mode either
       call show_space() in your test script or set the "TESTTESTERSPACE" environment  variable  to  be  a  true
       value. The example above would then look like

         # Got diag (5 bytes):
         # abcd\x{20}
         # Expected diag (4 bytes):
         # abcd

</pre><h4><b>COLOUR</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  prefer  to  use  colour  as a means of finding tricky whitespace characters then you can set the
       "TESTTESTCOLOUR" environment variable to a comma separated pair of colours, the first for the foreground,
       the second for the background. For example "white,red" will print white text on a  red  background.  This
       requires  the  Term::ANSIColor  module.  You  can  specify  any  colour  that  would be acceptable to the
       Term::ANSIColor::color function.

       If you spell colour differently, that's no problem. The "TESTTESTERCOLOR" variable also  works  (if  both
       are set then the British spelling wins out).

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTED</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>($premature,</u> <u>@results)</u> <u>=</u> <u>run_tests(\&amp;test_sub)</u>

       \&amp;test_sub is a reference to a subroutine.

       run_tests  runs  the subroutine in $test_sub and captures the results of any tests inside it. You can run
       more than 1 test inside this subroutine if you like.

       $premature is a string containing any diagnostic output from before the first test.

       @results is an array of test result hashes.

       <u>cmp_result(\%result,</u> <u>\%expect,</u> <u>$name)</u>

       \%result is a ref to a test result hash.

       \%expect is a ref to a hash of expected values for the test result.

       cmp_result compares the result with the  expected  values.  If  any  differences  are  found  it  outputs
       diagnostics.  You  may  leave  out  any  field  from  the  expected result and cmp_result will not do the
       comparison of that field.

       <u>cmp_results(\@results,</u> <u>\@expects,</u> <u>$name)</u>

       \@results is a ref to an array of test results.

       \@expects is a ref to an array of hash refs.

       cmp_results checks that the results match the expected results  and  if  any  differences  are  found  it
       outputs  diagnostics. It first checks that the number of elements in \@results and \@expects is the same.
       Then it goes through each result checking it against the expected result as in <b>cmp_result()</b> above.

       <u>($premature,</u> <u>@results)</u> <u>=</u> <u>check_tests(\&amp;test_sub,</u> <u>\@expects,</u> <u>$name)</u>

       \&amp;test_sub is a reference to a subroutine.

       \@expect is a ref to an array of hash refs which are expected test results.

       check_tests combines run_tests and cmp_tests into a single call. It also checks if the tests died at  any
       stage.

       It returns the same values as run_tests, so you can further examine the test results if you need to.

       <u>($premature,</u> <u>@results)</u> <u>=</u> <u>check_test(\&amp;test_sub,</u> <u>\%expect,</u> <u>$name)</u>

       \&amp;test_sub is a reference to a subroutine.

       \%expect is a ref to an hash of expected values for the test result.

       check_test  is  a  wrapper  around  check_tests.  It combines run_tests and cmp_tests into a single call,
       checking if the test died. It assumes that only a single test is run inside \&amp;test_sub and include a test
       to make sure this is true.

       It returns the same values as run_tests, so you can further examine the test results if you need to.

       <u><b>show_space()</b></u>

       Turn on the escaping of characters as described in the SPACES AND TABS section.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>IT</b> <b>WORKS</b></h4><pre>
       Normally, a test module (let's call it Test:MyStyle) calls Test::Builder-&gt;new to  get  the  Test::Builder
       object.  Test::MyStyle  calls  methods  on  this  object  to  record information about test results. When
       Test::Tester  is  loaded,  it  replaces  Test::Builder's  <b>new()</b>  method  with   one   which   returns   a
       Test::Tester::Delegate object. Most of the time this object behaves as the real Test::Builder object. Any
       methods  that  are  called  are delegated to the real Test::Builder object so everything works perfectly.
       However once we go into test mode, the method calls are  no  longer  passed  to  the  real  Test::Builder
       object,  instead  they  go  to  the Test::Tester::Capture object. This object seems exactly like the real
       Test::Builder object, except, instead of outputting test results and diagnostics, it just records all the
       information for later analysis.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Support for calling Test::Builder-&gt;note is minimal. It's implemented as an empty stub,  so  modules  that
       use  it  will  not  crash  but  the  calls are not recorded for testing purposes like the others. Patches
       welcome.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Builder the source of testing goodness. Test::Builder::Tester for an alternative  approach  to  the
       problem tackled by Test::Tester - captures the strings output by Test::Builder. This means you cannot get
       separate  access to the individual pieces of information and you must predict <b>exactly</b> what your test will
       output.
