       Test::Tester::Capture - Help testing test modules built with Test::Builder

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a subclass of Test::Builder that overrides many of the methods so that they don't output
       anything. It also keeps track of its own set of test results so that you can use Test::Builder based
       modules to perform tests on other Test::Builder based modules.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       Most of the code here was lifted straight from Test::Builder and then had chunks removed by Fergal Daly
       &lt;<a href="mailto:fergal@esatclear.ie">fergal@esatclear.ie</a>&gt;.
