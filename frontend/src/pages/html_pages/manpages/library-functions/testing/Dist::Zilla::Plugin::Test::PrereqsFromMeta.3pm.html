</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::PrereqsFromMeta - Check the prereqs from our META.json

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 4.23 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::PrereqsFromMeta, released December 17,
       2017 as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM version 6.000.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       In your <u>dist.ini</u>:

         [Test::PrereqsFromMeta]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This plugin will inject <u>t/00-all_prereqs.t</u> into your dist.  This test reads your <u>META.json</u> file and
       attempts to load all runtime prerequisites.  It fails if any required runtime prerequisites fail to load.
       (If the loaded version is less than the required version, it prints a warning message but the test does
       not fail.)

       In addition, if "AUTOMATED_TESTING" is set, it dumps out every module in %INC along with its version.
       This can help you determine the cause of failures reported by CPAN Testers.

       You can also get the version dump by running <u>t/00-all_prereqs.t</u> with the "-v" or "--verbose" option.
       (This is not the same as passing the "-v" option to "prove".)

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       No bugs have been reported.
