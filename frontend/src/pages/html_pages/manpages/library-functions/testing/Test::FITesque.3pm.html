</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::FITesque - the FITesque framework!

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.04

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Test::FITesque is a framework designed to emulate the FIT &lt;<a href="http://fit.c2.com">http://fit.c2.com</a>&gt; framework, but with a more
       perlish touch. While it is possible to use the FIT framework from within perl, it has a lot of
       unnecessary overhead related to its origins in the Java world.

       I created Test::FITesque for the following reasons:

       •   I wanted to store my fixture tables in whatever format i wanted (JSON, YAML, Storable, etc)

       •   I  wanted  to  simplify the execution process to make it very transparent. I have used FitNesse up to
           this point along with the perl server, but found that the java framework was  painful  to  debug  and
           overly complex for the task it needed to achieve.

       •   I wanted to use the normal perl testing tools and utilities to fit my workflow more closely.

       •   I  also  wanted  to  be  able to save the TAP output to more easily capture test results over time to
           track regressions and problematic tests.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       FITesque starts with creating FITesque fixtures which are simply packages which allow for the creation of
       objects upon which methods can be called.

         package MyApp::Test::Fixture;

         use strict;
         use warnings;
         use base qw(Test::FITesque::Fixture);
         use Test::More;

         file_exists : Test {
           my ($self, $file) = @_;

           ok -e $file, qq{File '$file' exists};
         }

       This simple fixture can now be run with a very basic and simple test.

         my $test = Test::FITesque::Test-&gt;new({
           data =&gt; [
             ['MyApp::Test::Fixture'],
             ['file_exists', '<a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>']
           ]
         });
         $test-&gt;run_tests();

       The data option is simply a table of data to use when executing the fixture  test.  The  first  row  must
       refer   to   the   name   of  the  Test::FITesque::Fixture  based  fixture  you  wish  to  execute  (like
       MyApp::Test::Fixture above). Any other cells in this row will be  passed  to  the  <b>new()</b>  method  on  the
       Fixture class.

       The  following  rows are all method calls on an instance of the Fixture class. This first cell must refer
       to a method name in the Fixture class, all following cells will be passed to the methods as arguments.

       The <b>run_tests()</b> method on the FITesque test will simply run these methods in the  order  specified  while
       taking care of maintaining TAP test count and the like underneath.

       If you have more than one instance of a test to run, you can add it to a suite.

         my $suite = Test::FITesque::Suite-&gt;new({
           data =&gt; [$test1, $test2, $test3]
         });
         $suite-&gt;run_tests();

       This  will  also  allow you to run test fixtures in a more dynamic fashion while still taking care of TAP
       test count.

       Suites can not only take a list of tests to run, but also suites themselves.

       The Test::FITesque package also supplies some handy helper functions to wrap most of  the  logic  up  for
       you. Please see the SYNOPSIS below for more information.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Test::FITesque;

         run_tests {
           suite { ... },
           test {
             ['MyApp::Test::Fixture'],
             ['file_exists', '<a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>']
           }
         };

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTED</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>test</b>
         test {
           ['Fixture::Class'],
           ['divides',    qw(8 4 2)],
           ['multiplies', qw(5 6 30)],
           ['adds',       qw(4 3 7)],
         }

       This function will return a Test::FITesque::Test object. It takes a coderef which returns a list of array
       references of which the first must refer to your FITesque fixture.

   <b>suite</b>
         suite {
           test {
             ...
           },
           test {
             ...
           },
           suite {
             test {
               ...
             }
           },
         }

       This  function  will  return  a  Test::FITesque::Suite object. It takes a coderef which returns a list of
       Test::FITesque::Test objects or/and Test::FITesque::Suite objects.

   <b>run_tests</b>
         run_tests {
           suite {
             ...
           },
           test {
             ...
           }
         }

       This function takes a coderef of suite and/or test objects. This will then wrap these all  into  a  suite
       and call Test::FITesque::Suite's run_tests method.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       •   Add more documentation

       •   Add some cookbook examples

       •   Look  at  some of the Fixture base class code to see if it can be restructured to allow for more evil
           coderef support.

       •   Update code to take advantage of newer Test::Harness/Test::Builder features.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Please report any bugs or feature requests to "bug-test-fitesque at  rt.cpan.org",  or  through  the  web
       interface  at  &lt;<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html">http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html</a>?Queue=Test-FITesque&gt;.   I  will be notified, and
       then you'll automatically be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Due to limitations in the TAP protocol and perl's TAP tools such as  Test::Harness,  all  Fixture  tables
       have to be held in memory. It also means that Fixture tables cannot be treated as a stream so there is no
       easy  way  to separate out which tables output is which. To remedy this, I suggest that you pass a 'name'
       parameter to the Fixture classes constructor and print this to screen or use  the  <b>diag()</b>  function  from
       Test::More.
