</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Distribution - perform tests on all modules of a distribution

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         $ cat t/01distribution.t
         use Test::More;

         BEGIN {
               eval {
                       require Test::Distribution;
               };
               if($@) {
                       plan skip_all =&gt; 'Test::Distribution not installed';
               }
               else {
                       import Test::Distribution;
               }
          }

         $ make test
         ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When using this module in a test script, it goes through all the modules in your distribution, checks
       their POD, checks that they compile ok and checks that they all define a  $VERSION.

       This module also performs a numer of test on  the distribution itself. It checks that your files match
       your  SIGNATURE file if you  have one. It checks that your distribution  isn't missing certain 'core'
       description files.  It checks to see you havent' missed out listing any pre-requisites in Makefile.PL.

       It defines its own testing plan, so you usually don't use it in conjunction with other "Test::*" modules
       in the same file. It's recommended that you just create a one-line test script as shown in the SYNOPSIS
       above. However, there are options...

       <b>NOTE</b> If you do not specify any options Test::Distribution will run all test types <b>except</b> signature
       testing which must always be explicitly switched on.

       In the future I may change the default to run no tests at all as this sounds safer. Mail me if you
       disagree.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       On the line in which you "use()" this module, you can specify named arguments that influence the testing
       behavior.

       "tests =&gt; NUMBER"
           Specifies  that  in  addition  to  the tests run by this module, your test script will run additional
           tests. In other words, this value influences the test plan. For example:

             use Test::Distribution tests =&gt; 1;
             use Test::More;
             is($foo, $bar, 'baz');

           It is important that you don't specify a "tests" argument  when  using  "Test::More"  or  other  test
           modules as the plan is handled by "Test::Distribution".

           DEPRECATED  FEATURE.  I  plan  to remove this in the future unless I'm contacted by someone that says
           they find this useful.

       "only =&gt; STRING|LIST"
           Specifies that only certain sets of tests are to be run. Possible values are those mentioned in  TEST
           TYPES below. For example, if you only want to run the POD tests, you could say:

             use Test::Distribution only =&gt; 'pod';

           To  specify  that you only want to run the POD tests and the "use" tests, and also that you are going
           to run two tests of your own, use:

             use Test::Distribution
               only  =&gt; [ qw/pod use/ ],
               tests =&gt; 2;

           Note that when you specify the "versions" option, the "use" option is automatically  added.  This  is
           because in order to get a module's $VERSION, it has to be loaded. In this case we might as well run a
           "use" test.

           The value for "only" can be a string or a reference to a list of strings.

       "not =&gt; STRING|LIST"
           Specifies that certain types of tests should not be run. All tests not mentioned in this argument are
           run. For example, if you want to test everything except the POD, use:

             use Test::Distribution
               not =&gt; 'pod';

           The  value for "not" can be a string or a reference to a list of strings. Although it doesn't seem to
           make much sense, you can use both "only" and "not". In this case only the tests specified in  "only",
           but not "not" are run (if this makes any sense).

       "distversion"
           If  you  test  this  to  a  true  value,  as well as testing that each module has a $VERSION defined,
           Test::Distribution will also ensure that the $VERSION matches that of the distribution.

       "podcoveropts"
           You can set this to be a hash reference of options to pass to  Test::Pod::Coverage's  pod_coverage_ok
           method (which in turn gets passed to Pod::Coverage.

</pre><h4><b>TEST</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a description of the types of tests available.

       "description"
           Checks that the following files exist:

           Changes  or ChangeLog
           MANIFEST
           README
           Build.PL or Makefile.PL
       "prereq"
           Checks  whether all "use()"d modules that aren't in the perl core are also mentioned in Makefile.PL's
           "PREREQ_PM".

       "pod"
           Checks for POD errors in files

       "podcover"
           Checks for Pod Coverage

       "sig"
           If the distribution   has a SIGNATURE  file, checks  the  SIGNATURE matches  the files.

       "use"
           This "use()"s the modules to make sure the load happens ok.

       "versions"
           Checks that all packages define $VERSION strings.

</pre><h4><b>EXPOSED</b> <b>INTERNALS</b></h4><pre>
       There are a few subroutines to help you see what this module is doing. Note that  these  subroutines  are
       neither exported nor exportable, so you have to call them fully qualified.

       "Test::Distribution::packages()"
           This is a list of packages that have been found. That is, we assume that each file contains a package
           of  the  name indicated by the file's relative position. For example, a file in "blib/lib/Foo/Bar.pm"
           is expected to be available via "use Foo::Bar".

       "Test::Distribution::files()"
           This is a list of files that tests have been run on. The filenames are relative to the distribution's
           root directory, so they start with "blib/lib".

       "Test::Distribution::num_tests()"
           This is the number of tests that this module has run, based on your specifications.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       This module uses Module::Build for its installation. To install this module type the following:

         perl Build.PL
         ./Build
         ./Build test
         ./Build install

       If you do not have Module::Build type:

         perl Makefile.PL

       to fetch it. Or use CPAN or CPANPLUS and fetch it "manually".

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       This module requires these other modules and libraries:

        File::Basename
        File::Find::Rule
        File::Spec
        Test::More

       This module has these optional dependencies:

        Module::CoreList
        Test::Pod
        Test::Pod::Coverage

       If "Module::CoreList" is missing, the "prereq" tests are skipped.

       If "Test::Pod" is missing, the "pod" tests are skipped.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       Just because these items are in the todo list,  does not mean they will actually be done. If  you   think
       one of these  would be helpful say  so - and it will then move up on my priority list.

       â€¢   Module::Build support  [currently waiting for a fix on Test::Prereq ]

</pre><h4><b>FEATURE</b> <b>IDEAS</b></h4><pre>
       "export" test type
           This would mandate that there should be a test for each exported symbol of each module.

       Let  me know what you think of these ideas. Are they necessary? Unnecessary? Do you have feature requests
       of your own?

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
