       Test::MockDateTime - mock DateTime-&gt;now calls during tests

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.02

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Test::More;
           use Test::MockDateTime;
           use DateTime;

           on '2013-01-02 03:04:05' =&gt; sub {
               # inside this block all calls to DateTime::now
               # will report a mocked date.

               my $now = DateTime-&gt;now;
               is $now-&gt;ymd, '2013-01-02', 'occured now';
           };

           done_testing;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Getting the current time sometimes is not very helpful for testing scenarios.  Instead, if you could
       obtain a known value during the runtime of a testcase will make your results predictable.

       Why another Date Mocker? I wanted something simple with a very concise usage pattern and a mocked date
       should only exist and stay constant inside a scope.  After leaving the scope the current time should be
       back. This lead to this tiny module.

       This simple module allows faking a given date and time for the runtime of a subsequent code block. By
       default the "on" keyword is exported into the namespace of the test file. The date to get mocked must be
       in a format that is recognized by DateTime::Format::DateParse.

           on '2013-01-02 03:04:05', sub { ... };

       is basically the same as

           {
               my $now = DateTime::Format::DateParse-&gt;parse_datetime(
                   '2013-01-02 03:04:05'
               );

               local *DateTime::now = sub { $now-&gt;clone };

               ... everything from code block above
           }

       A drawback when relying on this module is that you must know that the module you are testing uses
       "DateTime-&gt;now" to obtain the current time.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>on</b> <b>$date_and_time,</b> <b>\&amp;code</b>
       mocks date and time and then executes code

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       This module only mocks calls to "DateTime-&gt;now". All other ways to obtain a current time are not touched.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       There are some alternatives. Depending on the environment you might consider using one of them instead.

       Test::MockTime
           Very  universal, overwrites several subs at compile time and allows to set a fixed or ticking time at
           any place in your code.

       Time::Mock
           Also allows to set a time at various places inside your code.

       Test::MockTime::DateCalc
           Mocks several Date::Calc functions.

       Time::Fake
           Also overwrites several subs at compile time.
