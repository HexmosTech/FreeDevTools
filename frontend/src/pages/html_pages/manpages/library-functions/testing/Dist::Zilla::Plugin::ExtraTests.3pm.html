</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ExtraTests - rewrite ./xt tests to ./t tests with skips

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 6.032

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This plugin rewrites tests found in the following directories:

         ./xt/author  - tests for author testing (env AUTHOR_TESTING is true)
         ./xt/release - tests for pre-release testers (env RELEASE_TESTING is true)
         ./xt/smoke   - tests for automated testers (env AUTOMATED_TESTING is true)

       The tests are renamed and moved to <u>./t</u>, and they are rewritten to include some simple Perl code to skip
       all included tests if the correct env vars are not set.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
