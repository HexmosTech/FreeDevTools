</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Carp - test your code for calls to Carp functions

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Test::Carp version 0.2

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Test::More tests =&gt; 42;
           use Test::Carp;

           ok($x eq $y, "X does equal Y");
           does_carp(\&amp;function);
           does_croak(\&amp;function, 1, 2, 3);
           does_carp_that_matches(\&amp;function, qr/whoopsy/);
           does_croak_that_matches(\&amp;function, 1, 2, 3, qr/a likely story/);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Call given code (with given arguments) and tests whether the given Carp function (or their imported
       versions) are called (with a given value) or not.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       All functions are put in the caller's name space during <b>import()</b>. If you'd rather use their full name
       space and not clutter up the current package with functions just:

         require Test::Carp;

       or

         use Test::Carp ();

       instead of

         use Test::Carp;

   <b>being</b> <b>ok()</b> <b>w/</b> <b>ok()</b>
       Internally, Test::Carp uses <b>Test::More::ok()</b> (<b>require()</b>ing in Test::More if needed) when it needs to use
       an <b>ok()</b> function.

       If you want to specify a different one for it to use simply supply a coderef in the use statement.

          use Test::Carp \&amp;Test::Foo::ok;

       The function should take the same args as <b>Test::More::ok()</b> and probably behave the same as well.

   <b>carp()/cluck()</b> <b>functions</b>
       <b>does_carp()</b>
           Test whether the given code ref, when executed, calls <b>carp()</b>.

           Test fails if <b>carp()</b> is not called. There are 2 forms:

           Without arguments to codreref:

              does_carp(sub {...});

           With arge to coderef:

              does_carp(sub {...},"first arg to coderef", "second arg to coderef", ...);

       <b>does_carp_that_matches()</b>
           Test whether the given code ref, when executed, calls <b>carp()</b> with a specific message.

           The test fails if <b>carp()</b> is not called with the given message.

           The last argument should be a string or Regexp ref (i.e. qr//) to match the message against.

           There are 2 forms:

           Without arguments passed to codreref:

              does_carp(sub {...}, $match_me)

           With arguments passed to coderef:

              does_carp(sub {...},"first arg to coderef", "second arg to coderef", ..., $match_me);

       does_cluck
           Like <b>does_carp()</b> but for <b>cluck()</b>

       does_cluck_that_matches
           Like <b>does_carp_that_matches()</b> but for <b>cluck()</b>

   <b>croak()/confess()</b> <b>functions</b>
       These functions stop running at the point it calls the [croak|cluck]() just like in normal code.

       <b>does_croak()</b>
           Like <b>does_carp()</b> but for <b>croak()</b>

       <b>does_croak_that_matches()</b>
           Like <b>does_carp_that_matches()</b> but for <b>croak()</b>

       <b>does_confess()</b>
           Like <b>does_carp()</b> but for <b>confess()</b>

       <b>does_confess_that_matches()</b>
           Like <b>does_carp_that_matches()</b> but for <b>confess()</b>

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Throws no warnings or errors of it's own.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Carp requires no configuration files or environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       Test::More for <b>ok()</b> unless you define a different <b>ok()</b> for it to use.

       It uses Carp in order to ensure carp and corak are defined before it does what it does.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       No bugs have been reported.

       Please  report  any bugs or feature requests to "<a href="mailto:bug-test-carp@rt.cpan.org">bug-test-carp@rt.cpan.org</a>", or through the web interface
       at &lt;<a href="http://rt.cpan.org">http://rt.cpan.org</a>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       Corresponding does_not_* functions. (v0.2)

       TODOs in 02.functions.t (v0.2)

       Maybe count and overall call info type functions, depending on demand ?

       Determine [what needs done/if it should be done/etc] to make the test syntax not require a codref ?

       Add mostly-internal Carp functions like (short|long)mess[_heavy](), etc ?
