       Test::Simple - Basic utilities for writing tests.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 1;

         ok( $foo eq $bar, 'foo is bar' );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       ** If you are unfamiliar with testing <b>read</b> <b>Test::Tutorial</b> <b>first!</b> **

       This is an extremely simple, extremely basic module for writing tests suitable for CPAN modules and other
       pursuits.  If you wish to do more complicated testing, use the Test::More module (a drop-in replacement
       for this one).

       The basic unit of Perl testing is the ok.  For each thing you want to test your program will print out an
       "ok" or "not ok" to indicate pass or fail.  You do this with the ok() function (see below).

       The only other constraint is you must pre-declare how many tests you plan to run.  This is in case
       something goes horribly wrong during the test and your test program aborts, or skips a test or whatever.
       You do this like so:

           use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 23;

       You must have a plan.

       <b>ok</b>
             ok( $foo eq $bar, $name );
             ok( $foo eq $bar );

           ok()  is  given an expression (in this case "$foo eq $bar").  If it's true, the test passed.  If it's
           false, it didn't.  That's about it.

           ok() prints out either "ok" or "not ok" along with a test number (it keeps track of that for you).

             # This produces "ok 1 - Hell not yet frozen over" (or not ok)
             ok( get_temperature($hell) &gt; 0, 'Hell not yet frozen over' );

           If you provide a $name, that will be printed along with the "ok/not ok" to make  it  easier  to  find
           your  test  when  if  fails  (just search for the name).  It also makes it easier for the next guy to
           understand what your test is for.  It's highly recommended you use test names.

           All tests are run in scalar context.  So this:

               ok( @stuff, 'I have some stuff' );

           will do what you mean (fail if stuff is empty)

       Test::Simple will start by printing number of tests run in the form "1..M" (so "1..5" means you're  going
       to  run 5 tests).  This strange format lets Test::Harness know how many tests you plan on running in case
       something goes horribly wrong.

       If all your tests passed, Test::Simple will exit with zero (which is normal).  If anything failed it will
       exit with how many failed.  If you run less (or more) tests than you planned,  the  missing  (or  extras)
       will  be  considered failures.  If no tests were ever run Test::Simple will throw a warning and exit with
       255.  If the test died, even after having  successfully  completed  all  its  tests,  it  will  still  be
       considered a failure and will exit with 255.

       So the exit codes are...

           0                   all tests successful
           255                 test died or all passed but wrong # of tests run
           any other number    how many failed (including missing or extras)

       If you fail more than 254 tests, it will be reported as 254.

       This  module  is by no means trying to be a complete testing system.  It's just to get you started.  Once
       you're off the ground its recommended you look at Test::More.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Here's an example of a simple .t file for the fictional Film module.

           use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 5;

           use Film;  # What you're testing.

           my $btaste = Film-&gt;new({ Title    =&gt; 'Bad Taste',
                                    Director =&gt; 'Peter Jackson',
                                    Rating   =&gt; 'R',
                                    NumExplodingSheep =&gt; 1
                                  });
           ok( defined($btaste) &amp;&amp; ref $btaste eq 'Film',     'new() works' );

           ok( $btaste-&gt;Title      eq 'Bad Taste',     'Title() get'    );
           ok( $btaste-&gt;Director   eq 'Peter Jackson', 'Director() get' );
           ok( $btaste-&gt;Rating     eq 'R',             'Rating() get'   );
           ok( $btaste-&gt;NumExplodingSheep == 1,        'NumExplodingSheep() get' );

       It will produce output like this:

           1..5
           ok 1 - new() works
           ok 2 - Title() get
           ok 3 - Director() get
           not ok 4 - Rating() get
           #   Failed test 'Rating() get'
           #   in t/film.t at line 14.
           ok 5 - NumExplodingSheep() get
           # Looks like you failed 1 tests of 5

       Indicating the <b>Film::Rating()</b> method is broken.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Simple will only report a maximum of 254 failures in its exit code.  If  this  is  a  problem,  you
       probably  have  a  huge  test script.  Split it into multiple files.  (Otherwise blame the Unix folks for
       using an unsigned short integer as the exit status).

       Because VMS's exit codes are much, much different than the rest of the universe, and perl  does  horrible
       mangling to them that gets in my way, it works like this on VMS.

           0     SS$_NORMAL        all tests successful
           4     SS$_ABORT         something went wrong

       Unfortunately, I can't differentiate any further.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Simple is <b>explicitly</b> tested all the way back to perl 5.6.0.

       Test::Simple is thread-safe in perl 5.8.1 and up.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       This  module  was  conceived while talking with Tony Bowden in his kitchen one night about the problems I
       was having writing some really complicated feature into the new Testing module.   He  observed  that  the
       main  problem  is not dealing with these edge cases but that people hate to write tests <b>at</b> <b>all</b>.  What was
       needed was a dead simple module that took all the hard work out of testing and was really, really easy to
       learn.  Paul Johnson simultaneously had this idea (unfortunately, he wasn't in Tony's kitchen).  This  is
       it.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Test::More
           More  testing  functions!   Once  you outgrow Test::Simple, look at Test::More.  Test::Simple is 100%
           forward compatible with Test::More (i.e. you can just use Test::More instead of Test::Simple in  your
           programs and things will still work).

       Look in Test::More's SEE ALSO for more testing modules.
