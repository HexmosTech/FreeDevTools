</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Inline::Script - Generate the test file for a single source file

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.214

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class is where the heavy lifting happens to actually generating a test file takes place. Given a
       source filename, this modules will load it, parse out the relevant bits, put them into order based on the
       tags, and then merge them into a test file.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         my $File = Test::Inline::Script-&gt;new( $class, \@sections, $check_count );

       The "new" constructor takes a class name, set of Section objects and an optional "check_count" flag.

       Returns a Test::Inline::Script object on success.  Returns "undef" on error.

   <b>class</b>
       Returns the class that the test file will test

   <b>filename</b>
         my $filename = $File-&gt;filename;

       The "filename" method returns the name of the output file that the tests should be written to. For
       example, the class "Foo::Bar" would have the filename value "foo_bar.t".

   <b>config</b>
         my $config = $File-&gt;config;

       The "config" method returns the config object for the file, assuming that it has one. If more than one
       are found, the first will be used, and any additional config sections discarded.

       Returns a Test::Inline::Config object on success, or false if the file does not contain a config section.

   <b>setup</b>
         my @setup = $File-&gt;setup;

       The "setup" method returns the setup sections from the file, in the same order as in the file.

       Returns a list of setup Test::Inline::Section objects, the null array "()" if the file does not contain
       any setup objects.

   <b>sections</b>
         my @sections = $File-&gt;sections;

       The "sections" method returns all normal sections from the file, in the same order as in the file. This
       may not be the order they will be written to the test file, for that you should see the "sorted" method.

       Returns a list of Test::Inline::Section objects, or the null array "()" if the file does not contain any
       non-setup sections.

   <b>sorted</b>
       The "sorted" method returns all normal sections from the file, in an order that satisfies any
       dependencies in the sections.

       Returns a reference to an array of Test::Inline::Section objects, 0 if the file does not contain any non-
       setup sections, or "undef" on error.

   <b>tests</b>
       If the number of tests for all of the sections within the file are known, then the number of tests for
       the entire file can also be determined.

       The "tests" method determines if the number of tests can be known, and if so, calculates and returns the
       number of tests. Returns false if the number of tests is not known.

   <b>merged_content</b>
       The "merged_content" method generates and returns the merged contents of all the sections in the file,
       including the setup sections at the beginning. The method does not return the entire file, merely the
       part contained in the sections. For the full file contents, see the "file_content" method.

       Returns a string containing the merged section content on success, false if there is no content, despite
       the existence of sections ( which would have been empty ), or "undef" on error.
