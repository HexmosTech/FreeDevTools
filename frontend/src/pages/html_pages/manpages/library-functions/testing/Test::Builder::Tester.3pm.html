       Test::Builder::Tester - test testsuites that have been built with Test::Builder

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Test::Builder::Tester tests =&gt; 1;
           use Test::More;

           test_out("not ok 1 - foo");
           test_fail(+1);
           fail("foo");
           test_test("fail works");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A module that helps you test testing modules that are built with Test::Builder.

       The testing system is designed to be used by performing a three step process for each test you wish to
       test.  This process starts with using "test_out" and "test_err" in advance to declare what the testsuite
       you are testing will output with Test::Builder to stdout and stderr.

       You then can run the test(s) from your test suite that call Test::Builder.  At this point the output of
       Test::Builder is safely captured by Test::Builder::Tester rather than being interpreted as real test
       output.

       The final stage is to call "test_test" that will simply compare what you predeclared to what
       Test::Builder actually outputted, and report the results back with a "ok" or "not ok" (with debugging) to
       the normal output.

   <b>Functions</b>
       These are the six methods that are exported as default.

       test_out
       test_err
           Procedures  for predeclaring the output that your test suite is expected to produce until "test_test"
           is called.  These procedures automatically assume that each line terminates with "\n".  So

              test_out("ok 1","ok 2");

           is the same as

              test_out("ok 1\nok 2");

           which is even the same as

              test_out("ok 1");
              test_out("ok 2");

           Once "test_out" or "test_err" (or "test_fail" or "test_diag") have been called,  all  further  output
           from  Test::Builder  will be captured by Test::Builder::Tester.  This means that you will not be able
           perform further tests to the normal output in the normal way until you call "test_test" (well, unless
           you manually meddle with the output filehandles)

       test_fail
           Because the standard failure message that Test::Builder produces whenever a  test  fails  will  be  a
           common  occurrence  in  your  test  error  output,  and  because it has changed between Test::Builder
           versions, rather than forcing you to call "test_err" with the string all the time like so

               test_err("# Failed test ($0 at line ".line_num(+1).")");

           "test_fail" exists as a convenience function that can be called instead.  It takes one argument,  the
           offset from the current line that the line that causes the fail is on.

               test_fail(+1);

           This means that the example in the synopsis could be rewritten more simply as:

              test_out("not ok 1 - foo");
              test_fail(+1);
              fail("foo");
              test_test("fail works");

       test_diag
           As  most  of  the  remaining  expected  output to the error stream will be created by Test::Builder's
           "diag" function, Test::Builder::Tester provides a convenience function "test_diag" that you  can  use
           instead of "test_err".

           The  "test_diag" function prepends comment hashes and spacing to the start and newlines to the end of
           the expected output passed to it and adds it to the list of expected error output.   So,  instead  of
           writing

              test_err("# Couldn't open file");

           you can write

              test_diag("Couldn't open file");

           Remember  that Test::Builder's diag function will not add newlines to the end of output and test_diag
           will. So to check

              Test::Builder-&gt;new-&gt;diag("foo\n","bar\n");

           You would do

             test_diag("foo","bar")

           without the newlines.

       test_test
           Actually performs the output check testing the tests, comparing the data (with  "eq")  that  we  have
           captured from Test::Builder against what was declared with "test_out" and "test_err".

           This takes name/value pairs that affect how the test is run.

           title (synonym 'name', 'label')
               The name of the test that will be displayed after the "ok" or "not ok".

           skip_out
               Setting  this to a true value will cause the test to ignore if the output sent by the test to the
               output stream does not match that declared with "test_out".

           skip_err
               Setting this to a true value will cause the test to ignore if the output sent by the test to  the
               error stream does not match that declared with "test_err".

           As  a convenience, if only one argument is passed then this argument is assumed to be the name of the
           test (as in the above examples.)

           Once "test_test" has been run test output will be redirected back to the  original  filehandles  that
           Test::Builder  was  connected to (probably STDOUT and STDERR,) meaning any further tests you run will
           function normally and cause success/errors for Test::Harness.

       line_num
           A utility function that returns the line number that the function was called on.  You can pass it  an
           offset  which  will  be added to the result.  This is very useful for working out the correct text of
           diagnostic functions that contain line numbers.

           Essentially this is the same as the "__LINE__" macro, but the line_num(+3) idiom is arguably nicer.

       In addition to the six exported functions there exists one function that can  only  be  accessed  with  a
       fully qualified function call.

       color
           When  "test_test"  is  called  and  the output that your tests generate does not match that which you
           declared, "test_test" will print out debug information showing the two conflicting versions.  As this
           output itself is debug information it can be confusing which part of the output is  from  "test_test"
           and which was the original output from your original tests.  Also, it may be hard to spot things like
           extraneous  whitespace  at  the  end of lines that may cause your test to fail even though the output
           looks similar.

           To assist you "test_test" can colour the background of the  debug  information  to  disambiguate  the
           different  types  of  output.  The debug output will have its background coloured green and red.  The
           green part represents the text which is the same between the executed  and  actual  output,  the  red
           shows which part differs.

           The  "color"  function determines if colouring should occur or not.  Passing it a true or false value
           will enable or disable colouring respectively, and the function called with no argument  will  return
           the current setting.

           To  enable  colouring from the command line, you can use the Text::Builder::Tester::Color module like
           so:

              perl -Mlib=Text::Builder::Tester::Color test.t

           Or by including the Test::Builder::Tester::Color module directly in the PERL5LIB.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Builder::Tester does not handle plans well. It has never done anything  special  with  plans.  This
       means  that  plans from outside Test::Builder::Tester will affect Test::Builder::Tester, worse plans when
       using Test::Builder::Tester will affect overall testing. At this point there are no plans to fix this bug
       as people have come  to  depend  on  it,  and  Test::Builder::Tester  is  now  discouraged  in  favor  of
       Test2::API::intercept(). See &lt;https://github.com/Test-More/test-more/issues/667&gt;

       Calls  "Test::Builder-&gt;no_ending" turning off the ending tests.  This is needed as otherwise it will trip
       out because we've run more tests than we strictly should have and it'll register any failures we had that
       we were testing for as real failures.

       The color function doesn't work unless Term::ANSIColor is compatible with  your  terminal.  Additionally,
       Win32::Console::ANSI must be installed on windows platforms for color output.
