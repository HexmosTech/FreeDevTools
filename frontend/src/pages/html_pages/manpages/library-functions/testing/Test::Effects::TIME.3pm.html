</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Effects::TIME - Lexically set Test::Effects timing option

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Test::Effects::TIME version 0.000001

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           {
               use Test::Effects::TIME;
               # Test::Effects times its tests

               {
                   no Test::Effects::TIME;
                   # Test::Effects doesn't time its tests here
               }

               # Test::Effects reverts to timing its tests again here

           }
           # Test::Effects reverts to original (non-timing) behaviour here

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Using this module changes the default behaviour of Test::Effects's "effects_ok()" test.

       Normally this test does not time the code it tests (unless explicitly told otherwise via the use of "TIME
       =&gt; 1" or "TIME()"). If this module is used in a code block, "effects_ok()" defaults to timing its tests
       for the remainder of that block's lexical scope.

       Note, however, that an explicit "TIME =&gt; 0" option in any call to "&lt;effects_ok()" overrides this lexical
       default.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"use</b> <b>Test::Effects::TIME;"</b>
       "effects_ok" defaults to timing the code it tests within the rest of the current lexical scope.

   <b>"no</b> <b>Test::Effects::TIME;"</b>
       "effects_ok" defaults to not timing the code it tests within the rest of the current lexical scope.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Effects::TIME requires no configuration files or environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       Requires Perl 5.14 (or better).

       Does not require, but is meaningless without, the Test::Effects module.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       No bugs have been reported.
