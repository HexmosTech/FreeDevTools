       CGI::Test::Page - Abstract represention of an HTTP reply content

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        # Deferred class, only heirs can be created
        # $page holds a CGI::Test::Page object

        use CGI::Test;

        ok 1, $page-&gt;is_ok;
        ok 2, $page-&gt;user ne '';    # authenticated access

        my $ctype = $page-&gt;content_type;
        ok 3, $ctype eq "text/plain";

        $page-&gt;delete;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "CGI::Test::Page" class is deferred.  It is an abstract representation of an HTTP reply content,
       which would be displayed on a browser, as a page.  It does not necessarily hold HTML content.

       Here is an outline of the class hierarchy tree, with the leading "CGI::Test::" string stripped for
       readability, and a trailing "*" indicating deferred clases:

           Page*
             Page::Error
             Page::Real*
               Page::HTML
               Page::Other
               Page::Text

       Those classes are constructed as needed by "CGI::Test".  You must always call <u>delete</u> on them to break the
       circular references if you care about reclaiming unused memory.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       This is the interface defined at the "CGI::Test::Page" level.  Each subclass may add further specific
       features, but the following is available to the whole hierarchy:

       "content_type"
           The  MIME  content  type, along with parameters, as it appeared in the headers.  For instance, it can
           be:

                   text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1

           Don't assume it to be just "text/html" though.  Use something like:

                   ok 1, $page-&gt;content_type =~ m|^text/html\b|;

           in your regression tests, which will match whether there are parameters following the content type or
           not.

       "delete"
           Breaks circular references to allow proper reclaiming of unused memory.  Must be the  last  thing  to
           call on the object before forgetting about it.

       "error_code"
           The  error  code.   Will  be  0  to mean OK, but otherwise HTTP error codes are used, as described by
           HTTP::Status.

       "forms"
           Returns a list reference containing all the CGI forms on  the  page,  as  "CGI::Test::Form"  objects.
           Will be an empty list for anything but "CGI::Test::Page::HTML", naturally.

       "form_count"
           The amount of forms held in the "forms" list.

       "is_error"
           Returns <u>true</u> when the page indicates an HTTP error.

       "is_ok"
           Returns <u>true</u> when the page is not the result of an HTTP error.

       "server"
           Returns  the server object that returned the page.  Currently, this is the "CGI::Test" object, but it
           might change one day.  In any case, this is the place where GET/POST requests may be addresed.

       "user"
           The authenticated user that requested this page, or "undef" if no authentication was made.
