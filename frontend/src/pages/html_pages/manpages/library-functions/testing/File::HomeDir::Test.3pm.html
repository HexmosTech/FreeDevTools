</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::HomeDir::Test - Prevent the accidental creation of user-owned files during testing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Test::More test =&gt; 1;
         use File::HomeDir::Test;
         use File::HomeDir;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>File::HomeDir::Test</b> is a File::HomeDir driver intended for use in the test scripts of modules or
       applications that write files into user-owned directories.

       It is designed to prevent the pollution of user directories with files that are not part of the
       application install itself, but were created during testing. These files can leak state information from
       the tests into the run-time usage of an application, and on Unix systems also prevents tests (which may
       be executed as root via sudo) from writing files which cannot later be modified or removed by the regular
       user.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       See the support section of the main File::HomeDir documentation.
