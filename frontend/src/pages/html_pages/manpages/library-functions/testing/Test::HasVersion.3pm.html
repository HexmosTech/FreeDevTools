</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::HasVersion - Check Perl modules have version numbers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       "Test::HasVersion" lets you check a Perl module has a version number in a "Test::Simple" fashion.

         use Test::HasVersion tests =&gt; 1;
         pm_version_ok("M.pm", "Valid version");

       Module authors can include the following in a <u>t/has_version.t</u> file and let "Test::HasVersion" find and
       check all installable PM files in a distribution.

         use Test::More;
         eval "use Test::HasVersion";
         plan skip_all =&gt;
              'Test::HasVersion required for testing for version numbers' if $@;
         all_pm_version_ok();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Do you wanna check that every one of your Perl modules in a distribution has a version number? You wanna
       make sure you don't forget the brand new modules you just added?  Well, that's the module you have been
       looking for.  Use it!

       Do you wanna check someone else's distribution to make sure the author have not committed the sin of
       leaving Perl modules without a version that can be used to tell if you have this or that feature?
       "Test::HasVersion" is also for you, nasty little fellow.

       There's a script <u>test_version</u> which is installed with this distribution. You may invoke it from within
       the root directory of a distribution you just unpacked, and it will check every <u>.pm</u> file in the directory
       and under <u>lib/</u> (if any).

         $ test_version

       You may also provide directories and files as arguments.

         $ test_version *.pm lib/ inc/
         $ test_version .

       (Be warned that many Perl modules in a <u>t/</u> directory do not receive versions because they are not used
       outside the distribution.)

       Ok. That's not a very useful module by now.  But it will be. Wait for the upcoming releases.

   <b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       PRIVATE <b>_pm_version</b>
             $v = _pm_version($pm);

           Parses  a PM file and return what it thinks is $VERSION in this file. (Actually implemented with "use
           ExtUtils::MakeMaker; MM-&gt;parse_version($file)".)  $pm is the filename (eg., <u>lib/Data/Dumper.pm</u>).

       <b>pm_version_ok</b>
             pm_version_ok('Module.pm');
             pm_version_ok('M.pm', 'Has valid version');

           Checks to see if the given file has a valid version. Actually a valid version number is  defined  and
           not equal to 'undef' (the string) which is return by "_pm_version" if a version cannot be determined.

       <b>all_pm_version_ok</b>
             all_pm_version_ok();
             all_pm_version_ok(@PM_FILES);

           Checks  every  given  file  and  <u>.pm</u> files found under given directories to see if they provide valid
           version numbers. If no argument is given, it defaults  to  check  every  file  <u>*.pm</u>  in  the  current
           directory and recurses under the <u>lib/</u> directory (if it exists).

           If no test plan was setted, "Test::HasVersion" will set one after computing the number of files to be
           tested. Otherwise, the plan is left untouched.

       PRIVATE <b>_list_pm_files</b>
             @pm_files = _list_pm_files(@dirs);

           Returns all PM files under the given directories.

       <b>all_pm_files</b>
             @files = all_pm_files()
             @files = all_pm_files(@files_and_dirs);

           Implements   finding   the  Perl  modules  according  to  the  semantics  of  the  previous  function
           "all_pm_version_ok".

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Other usage patterns besides the ones given in the synopsis.

         use Test::More tests =&gt; $num_tests;
         use Test::HasVersion;
         pm_version_ok($file1);
         pm_version_ok($file2);

       Obviously, you can't plan twice.

         use Test::More;
         use Test::HasVersion;
         plan tests =&gt; $num_tests;
         pm_version_ok($file);

       "plan" comes from "Test::More".

         use Test::More;
         use Test::HasVersion;
         plan 'no_plan';
         pm_version_ok($file);

       "no_plan" is ok either.
