</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Compile - Assert that your Perl files compile OK.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Test::Compile qw();

           my $test = Test::Compile-&gt;new();
           $test-&gt;all_files_ok();
           $test-&gt;done_testing();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Test::Compile" lets you check the whether your perl modules and scripts compile properly, results are
       reported in standard "Test::Simple" fashion.

       The basic usage - as shown above, will locate your perl files and test that they all compile.

       Module authors can (and probably should) include the following in a <u>t/00-compile.t</u> file and have
       "Test::Compile" automatically find and check all Perl files in a module distribution:

           #!perl
           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Test::Compile qw();

           my $test = Test::Compile-&gt;new();
           $test-&gt;all_files_ok();
           $test-&gt;done_testing();

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new()
           The  constructor,  which actually returns a Test::Compile::Internal object.  This gives you access to
           all the methods provided by "Test::Compile::Internal", including those listed below.

       all_files_ok(@dirs)
           Looks for perl files and tests them all for compilation errors.

           See "all_files_ok(@dirs)" in Test::Compile::Internal for the full documentation.

       done_testing()
           Declares that you are done testing, no more tests will be run after this point.

       diag(@msgs)
           Prints out the given @msgs. Like print, arguments are simply appended together.

           Output will be indented and marked with a # so as not to interfere with test output. A  newline  will
           be put on the end if there isn't one already.

           We encourage using this rather than calling print directly.

       skip($reason)
           Skips the current test, reporting the $reason.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The use of the following functions is deprecated and strongly discouraged.

       Instead,   you   should   use   the  object  oriented  interface  described  in  the  "SYNOPSIS"  and  in
       Test::Compile::Internal.

       They are automatically exported to your namespace,  which is no longer considered best practise.  At some
       stage in the future, this will stop and you'll have to import them explicitly to keep using them.

       The object oriented methods also provide a more consistent  interface.   For  example:  all_pm_files_ok()
       calls the plan() function - so you can't call multiple test functions in the same test file.

       all_pm_files_ok(@files)
           <b>This</b> <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>deprecated</b>.  Please use "all_pm_files_ok(@dirs)" in Test::Compile::Internal instead.
           It's pretty much the same, except it doesn't call the plan() function.

           Checks all the perl module files it can find for compilation errors.

           It uses all_pm_files(@files) to find the perl module files.

           It  also  calls  the  plan()  function  for you (one test for each module), so you can't have already
           called plan(). Unfortunately, this also means you can't use this function with all_pl_files_ok().  If
           this is a problem you should really be using the object oriented interface.

           Returns true if all Perl module files are ok, or false if any fail.

       all_pl_files_ok(@files)
           <b>This</b> <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>deprecated</b>.  Please use "all_pl_files_ok(@dirs)" in Test::Compile::Internal instead.
           It's pretty much the same, except it doesn't call the plan() function.

           Checks all the perl script files it can find for compilation errors.

           It uses all_pl_files(@files) to find the perl script files.

           It also calls the plan() function for you (one test for each  script),  so  you  can't  have  already
           called "plan". Unfortunately, this also means you can't use this function with all_pm_files_ok().  If
           this is a problem you should really be using the object oriented interface.

           Returns true if all Perl script files are ok, or false if any fail.

       "pm_file_ok($filename, $testname)"
           <b>This</b> <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>deprecated</b>.  Please use "all_pm_files_ok(@dirs)" in Test::Compile::Internal instead.
           It's  pretty  much the same, except it won't allow you to specify a test name, and it can handle more
           than one file at a time.

           pm_file_ok() will okay the test if $filename compiles as a perl module.

           The optional second argument $testname is the name of  the  test.  If  it  is  omitted,  pm_file_ok()
           chooses a default test name Compile test for $filename.

       "pl_file_ok($filename, $testname)"
           <b>This</b> <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>deprecated</b>.  Please use "all_pl_files_ok(@dirs)" in Test::Compile::Internal instead.
           It's pretty much the same, except you can't specify a test name, and it can handle more than one file
           at a time.

           pl_file_ok()  will okay the test if $filename compiles as a perl script. You need to give the path to
           the script relative to this  distribution's  base  directory.  So  if  you  put  your  scripts  in  a
           'top-level' directory called script the argument would be "script/filename".

           The  optional  second  argument  $testname  is  the  name of the test. If it is omitted, pl_file_ok()
           chooses a default test name Compile test for $filename.

       all_pm_files(@dirs)
           <b>This</b> <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>deprecated</b>.  Please use "all_pm_files(@dirs)" in Test::Compile::Internal instead.

           Returns a list of all the perl module files - that is,  files  ending  in  <u>.pm</u>  -  in  <u>@dirs</u>  and  in
           directories  below.  If no directories are passed, it defaults to <u>blib</u> if <u>blib</u> exists, or else <u>lib</u> if
           not. Skips any files in <u>CVS</u>, <u>.svn</u>, or <u>.git</u> directories.

       all_pl_files(@dirs)
           <b>This</b> <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>deprecated</b>.  Please use "all_pl_files(@dirs)" in Test::Compile::Internal instead.

           Returns a list of all the perl script files - that is, any files in @dirs  that  either  have  a  <u>.pl</u>
           extension, or have no extension and have a perl shebang line.

           If @dirs is undefined, it searches <u>script</u> if <u>script</u> exists, or else <u>bin</u> if <u>bin</u> exists.

           Skips any files in <u>CVS</u>, <u>.svn</u>, or <u>.git</u> directories.

       all_files_ok(@dirs)
           <b>This</b> <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>deprecated</b>.  Please use "all_files_ok(@dirs)" in Test::Compile::Internal instead.

           Checks all the perl files it can find for compilation errors.

           If  @dirs  is  defined  then  it  is  taken as an array of directories to be searched for perl files,
           otherwise it searches some default locations - see "all_pm_files(@dirs)" and "all_pl_files(@dirs)".

       Test::Compile::Internal  provides  the  object  oriented  interface  to  (and the inner workings for) the
       Test::Compile functionality.

       Test::Strict provides functions to ensure your perl files compile, with the  added  bonus  that  it  will
       check you have used strict in all your files.

       Test::LoadAllModules just handles modules, not script files, but has more fine-grained control.
