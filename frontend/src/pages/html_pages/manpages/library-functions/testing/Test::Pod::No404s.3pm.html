</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Pod::No404s - Using this test module will check your POD for any http 404 links

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
         This document describes v0.02 of Test::Pod::No404s - released November 01, 2014 as part of Test-Pod-No404s.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>
               use strict; use warnings;

               use Test::More;

               eval "use Test::Pod::No404s";
               if ( $@ ) {
                       plan skip_all =&gt; 'Test::Pod::No404s required for testing POD';
               } else {
                       all_pod_files_ok();
               }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module looks for any http(s) links in your POD and verifies that they will not return a 404. It uses
       LWP::UserAgent for the heavy lifting, and simply lets you know if it failed to retrieve the document.
       More specifically, it uses $response-&gt;is_error as the "test."

       This module does <b>NOT</b> check "pod" or "man" links like "L&lt;Test::Pod&gt;" in your pod. For that, please check
       out Test::Pod::LinkCheck.

       Normally, you wouldn't want this test to be run during end-user installation because they might have no
       internet! It is HIGHLY recommended that this be used only for module authors' RELEASE_TESTING phase. To
       do that, just modify the synopsis to add an env check :)

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>pod_file_ok</b>
       "pod_file_ok()" will okay the test if there is no http(s) links present in the POD or if all links are
       not an error. Furthermore, if the POD was malformed as reported by Pod::Simple, the test will fail and
       not attempt to check the links.

       When it fails, "pod_file_ok()" will show any failing links as diagnostics.

       The optional second argument TESTNAME is the name of the test.  If it is omitted, "pod_file_ok()" chooses
       a default test name "404 test for FILENAME".

   <b>all_pod_files_ok</b>
       This function is what you will usually run. It automatically finds any POD in your distribution and runs
       checks on them.

       Accepts an optional argument: an array of files to check. By default it checks all POD files it can find
       in the distribution. Every file it finds is passed to the "pod_file_ok" function.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Automatically exports the two subs.
