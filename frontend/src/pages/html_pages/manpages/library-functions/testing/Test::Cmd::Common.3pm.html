</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "Test::Cmd::Common" module provides a simple, high-level interface for writing tests of executable
       commands and scripts, especially commands and scripts that interact with the file system.  All methods
       throw exceptions and exit on failure.  This makes it unnecessary to add explicit checks for return
       values, making the test scripts themselves simpler to write and easier to read.

       The "Test::Cmd::Common" class is a subclass of Test::Cmd.  In essence, "Test::Cmd::Common" is a wrapper
       that treats common Test::Cmd error conditions as exceptions that terminate the test.  You can use
       "Test::Cmd::Common" directly, or subclass it for your program and add additional (or override) methods to
       tailor it to your program's specific needs.  Alternatively, "Test::Cmd::Common" serves as a useful
       example of how to define your own Test::Cmd subclass.

       The "Test::Cmd::Common" module provides the following importable variables:

       $_exe
           The  executable file suffix.  This value is normally available as $Config{_exe} in Perl version 5.005
           and later.  The "Test::Cmd::Common" module figures it out via other means in earlier versions.

       $_o The object file suffix.  This value is normally available from $Config{_o} in Perl version 5.005  and
           later.  The "Test::Cmd::Common" module figures it out via other means in earlier versions.

       $_a The  library file suffix.  This value is normally available from as $Config{_a} in Perl version 5.005
           and later.  The "Test::Cmd::Common" module figures it out via other means in earlier versions.

       $_so
           The shared library file suffix.  This value is normally available as  $Config{_so}  in  Perl  version
           5.005 and later.  The "Test::Cmd::Common" module figures it out via other means in earlier versions.

       $_is_win32
           A Boolean value that reflects whether the current platform is a Win32 system.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "new"
           Creates a new test environment object.  Any arguments are keyword-value pairs that are passed through
           to  the construct method for the base class from which we inherit our methods (that is, the Test::Cmd
           class).  In the normal case, this should be the program  to  be  tested  and  a  description  of  the
           functionality being tested:

               $test = Test::Cmd::Common-&gt;new(prog =&gt; 'my_program',
                                              string =&gt; 'cool new feature');

           By  default, methods that match actual versus expected output (the "run", and "file_matches" methods)
           use an exact match.  Tests that require regular expression matches can specify this on initialization
           of the test environment:

               $test = Test::Cmd::Common-&gt;new(prog =&gt; 'my_program',
                                              string =&gt; 'cool new feature',
                                              match_sub =&gt; \&amp;Test::Cmd::diff_regex);

           or by executing the following after initialization of the test environment:

               $test-&gt;match_sub(\&amp;Test::Cmd::diff_regex);

           Creates a temporary working directory for the test environment and changes directory to it.

           Exits NO RESULT if the object can not be created, the temporary working directory can not be created,
           or the current directory cannot be changed to the temporary working directory.

       "run"
           Runs the program under test, checking that the test succeeded.   Arguments  are  keyword-value  pairs
           that affect the manner in which the program is executed or the results are evaluated.

               chdir =&gt; 'subdir'
               fail =&gt; 'failure condition' # default is '$? != 0'
               flags =&gt; 'Cons flags'
               stderr =&gt; 'expected error output'
               stdout =&gt; 'expected standard output'
               targets =&gt; 'targets to build'

           The test fails if:

             --  The specified failure condition is met.  The default failure
                 condition is '$? != 0', i.e. the program exits unsuccesfully.
                 A not-uncommon alternative is:

                     $test-&gt;run(fail =&gt; '$? == 0');        # expect failure

                 when testing how the program handles errors.

             --  Actual standard output does not match expected standard output
                 (if any).  The expected standard output is an array of lines
                 or a scalar which will be split on newlines.

             --  Actual error output does not match expected error output (if
                 any).  The expected error output is an array of lines or a
                 scalar which will be split on newlines.

                 This method will test for NO error output by default if no
                 expected error output is specified (unlike standard output).
                 The error output test may be explicitly suppressed by
                 specifying undef as the "expected" error output:

                     $test-&gt;run(stderr =&gt; undef);

           By  default,  this  method  performs  an  exact match of actual vs. expected standard output or error
           output:

               $test-&gt;run(stdout =&gt; &lt;&lt;_EOF_, stderr =&gt; _EOF_);
               An expected STDOUT line, which must be matched exactly.
               _EOF_
               One or more expected STDERR lines,
               which must be matched exactly.
               _EOF_

           Tests that require regular expression matches should be executed using a test environment that  calls
           the "match_sub" method as follows:

               $test-&gt;match_sub(\&amp;Test::Cmd::diff_regex);

               $test-&gt;run(stdout =&gt; &lt;&lt;_EOF_, stderr =&gt; _EOF_);
               An expected (STDOUT|standard output) line\.
               _EOF_
               One or more expected (STDERR|error output) lines,
               which may contain (regexes|regular expressions)\.
               _EOF_

       "subdir"
           Creates one or more subdirectories in the temporary working directory.  Exits NO RESULT if the number
           of  subdirectories  actually  created does not match the number expected.  For compatibility with its
           superclass method, returns the number of subdirectories actually created.

       "read"
           Reads the contents of a file, depositing the contents in the destination referred  to  by  the  first
           argument  (a  scalar  or  array  reference).   If  the  file name is not an absolute path name, it is
           relative to the temporary working directory.  Exits NO RESULT if the file could not be read  for  any
           reason.  For compatibility with its superclass method, returns TRUE on success.

       "write"
           Writes  a  file  with  the  specified contents.  If the file name is not an absolute path name, it is
           relative to the temporary working directory.  Exits NO RESULT if there were any  errors  writing  the
           file.  For compatibility with its superclass method, returns TRUE on success.

               $test-&gt;write('file', &lt;&lt;_EOF_);
               contents of the file
               _EOF_

       "file_matches"
           Matches  the  contents  of  the  specified  file (first argument) against the expected contents.  The
           expected contents are an array of lines or a scalar which will be split  on  newlines.   By  default,
           each expected line must match exactly its corresponding line in the file:

               $test-&gt;file_matches('file', &lt;&lt;_EOF_);
               Line #1.
               Line #2.
               _EOF_

           Tests  that require regular expression matches should be executed using a test environment that calls
           the "match_sub" method as follows:

               $test-&gt;match_sub(\&amp;Test::Cmd::diff_regex);

               $test-&gt;file_matches('file', &lt;&lt;_EOF_);
               The (1st|first) line\.
               The (2nd|second) line\.
               _EOF_

       "must_exist"
           Ensures that the specified files must exist.  Files  may  be  specified  as  an  array  reference  of
           directory  components,  in  which case the pathname will be constructed by concatenating them.  Exits
           FAILED if any of the files does not exist.

       "must_not_exist"
           Ensures that the specified files must not exist.  Files may be specified as  an  array  reference  of
           directory  components,  in  which case the pathname will be constructed by concatenating them.  Exits
           FAILED if any of the files exists.

       "copy"
           Copies a file from the source (first argument) to the destination (second argument).  Exits NO RESULT
           if the file could not be copied for any reason.

       "chmod"
           Changes the permissions of a list of files to the specified mode (first argument).  Exits  NO  RESULT
           if any file could not be changed for any reason.

       "sleep"
           Sleeps  at  least  the  specified  number  of  seconds.  If no number is specified, sleeps at least a
           minimum number of seconds necessary to advance file time stamps on the current system.  Sleeping more
           seconds is all right.  Exits NO RESULT if the time slept was less than specified.

       "touch"
           Updates the access and modification times of the specified files.  Exits NO RESULT if any file  could
           not be modified for any reason.

       "unlink"
           Removes the specified files.  Exits NO RESULT if any file could not be removed for any reason.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  "Test::Cmd::Common"  module  also  uses  the  "PRESERVE", "PRESERVE_FAIL", "PRESERVE_NO_RESULT", and
       "PRESERVE_PASS" environment variables from the Test::Cmd module.  See  the  Test::Cmd  documentation  for
       details.

       The most involved example of using the "Test::Cmd::Common" module to test a real-world application is the
       "cons-test"   testing   suite  for  the  Cons  software  construction  utility.   The  suite  sub-classes
       "Test::Cmd::Common" to provide common, application-specific infrastructure across a large number of  end-
       to-end application tests.  The suite, and other information about Cons, is available at:

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Thanks to Johan Holmberg for asking the question that led to the creation of this package.

       The general idea of testing commands in this way, as well as the test reporting of the "pass", "fail" and
       "no_result"  methods,  come  from  the  testing  framework invented by Peter Miller for his Aegis project
       change supervisor.  Aegis is an excellent  bit  of  work  which  integrates  creation  and  execution  of
       regression tests into the software development process.  Information about Aegis is available at:
