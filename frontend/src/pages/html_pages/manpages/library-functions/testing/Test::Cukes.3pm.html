       Test::Cukes - A BBD test tool inspired by Cucumber

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Write your test program like this:

         # test.pl
         use Test::Cukes;
         # use Test::Cukes tests =&gt; 3;

         feature(&lt;&lt;TEXT);
         Feature: writing behavior tests
           In order to make me happy
           As a test maniac
           I want to write behavior tests

           Scenario: Hello World
             Given the test program is running
             When it reaches this step
             Then it should pass
         TEXT

         Given qr/the (.+) program is (.+)/, sub {
             my ($program_name, $running_or_failing) = @_;
             assert "running program '$program_name'";
         };

         When qr/it reaches this step/, sub {
             assert "reaches";
         };

         Then qr/it should pass/, sub {
             assert "passes";
         };

         runtests;

       When it runs, it looks like this:

           &gt; perl test.pl
           1..3
           ok 1 - Given the test program is running
           ok 2 - When it reaches this step
           ok 3 - Then it should pass

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Cukes is a testing tool inspired by Cucumber (&lt;<a href="http://cukes.info">http://cukes.info</a>&gt;). It lets your write your module
       test with scenarios. It may be used with Test::More or other family of TAP "Test::*" modules. It uses
       Test::Builder::note function internally to print messages.

       This module implements the Given-When-Then clause only in English. To uses it in the test programs, feed
       the feature text into "feature" function, defines your step handlers, and then run all the tests by
       calling "runtests". Step handlers may be defined in separate modules, as long as those modules are
       included before "runtests" is called.  Each step may use either "assert" or standard TAP functions such
       as "Test::Simple"'s "ok" or "Test::More"'s "is" to verify desired result.  If you specify a plan
       explicitly, you should be aware that each step line in your scenario runs an additional test, and will
       therefore add to the number of tests you must indicate.

       If any assertion in the Given block failed, the following "When" and "Then" blocks are all skipped.

       You don't need to specify the number of tests with "plan". Each step block itself is simply one test. If
       the block died, it's then considered failed. Otherwise it's considered as passing.

       In the call to Test::Cukes::runtests, done_testing will automatically be called for you if you didn't
       specify a plan.

       Test::Cukes re-exports "assert" function from "Carp::Assert" for you to use in the step block.
