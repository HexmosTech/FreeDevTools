       Test::LectroTest::Compat - Use LectroTest property checks in a Test::Simple world

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.5001

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a> -w

           use MyModule;  # contains code we want to test
           use Test::More tests =&gt; 2;
           use Test::LectroTest::Compat;

           # property specs can now use Test::Builder-based
           # tests such as Test::More's cmp_ok()

           my $prop_nonnegative = Property {
               ##[ x &lt;- Int, y &lt;- Int ]##
               cmp_ok(MyModule::my_function( $x, $y ), '&gt;=', 0);
           }, name =&gt; "my_function output is non-negative" ;

           # and we can now check whether properties hold
           # as a Test::Builder-style test that integrates
           # with other T::B tests

           holds( $prop_nonnegative );   # test whether prop holds
           cmp_ok( 0, '&lt;', 1, "trivial 0&lt;1 test" );  # a "normal" test

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module lets you use mix LectroTest property checking with other popular Test::* modules.  With it,
       you can use "is()"- and "ok()"-style assertions from Test::* modules within your LectroTest property
       specifications and you can check LectroTest properties as part of a Test::Simple or Test::More test plan.
       (You can actually take advantage of any module based on Test::Builder, not just Test::Simple and
       Test::More.)

       The module exports a single function "holds" which is described below.

   <b>holds(</b><u><b>property</b></u><b>,</b> <u><b>opts</b></u><b>...)</b>
           holds( $prop_nonnegative );  # check prop_nonnegative

           holds( $prop_nonnegative, trials =&gt; 100 );

           holds(
               Property {
                   ##[ x &lt;- Int ]##
                   my_function2($x) &lt; 0;
               }, name =&gt; "my_function2 is non-positive"
           );

       Checks whether the given property holds.

       When called, this method creates a new Test::LectroTest::TestRunner, asks the TestRunner to check the
       property, and then reports the result to Test::Builder, which in turn reports to you as part of a typical
       Test::Simple- or Test::More-style test plan.  Any options you provide to "holds" after the property will
       be passed to the "TestRunner" so you can change the number of trials to run and so on.  (See the docs for
       "new" in Test::LectroTest::TestRunner for the complete list of options.)

</pre><h4><b>TESTING</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>REGRESSIONS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CORNER</b> <b>CASES</b></h4><pre>
       LectroTest can record failure-causing test cases to a file, and it can play those test cases back as part
       of its normal testing strategy.  The easiest way to take advantage of this feature is to set the
       <u>regressions</u> parameter when you "use" this module:

           use Test::LectroTest::Compat
               regressions =&gt; "regressions.txt";

       This tells LectroTest to use the file "regressions.txt" for both recording and playing back failures.  If
       you want to record and play back from separate files, or want only to record <u>or</u> play back, use the
       <u>record_failures</u> and/or <u>playback_failures</u> options:

           use Test::LectroTest::Compat
               playback_failures =&gt; "regression_suite_for_my_module.txt",
               record_failures   =&gt; "failures_in_the_field.txt";

       See Test::LectroTest::RegressionTesting for more.

       <b>NOTE:</b>  If you pass any of the recording or playback parameters to Test::LectroTest::Compat, you must have
       version 0.3500 or greater of LectroTest installed.  Module authors, update your modules' build
       dependencies accordingly.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       In order to integrate with the Test::Builder testing harness (whose underlying testing model is somewhat
       incompatible with the needs of random trial-based testing) this module redefines two Test::Builder
       functions ("ok()" and "diag()") for the duration of each property check.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       For a gentle introduction to LectroTest, see Test::LectroTest::Tutorial.  Also, the slides from my
       LectroTest talk for the Pittsburgh Perl Mongers make for a great introduction.  Download a copy from the
       LectroTest home (see below).

       Test::LectroTest::RegressionTesting explains how to test for regressions and corner cases using
       LectroTest.

       Test::LectroTest::Property explains in detail what you can put inside of your property specifications.

       Test::LectroTest::Generator describes the many generators and generator combinators that you can use to
       define the test or condition space that you want LectroTest to search for bugs.

       Test::LectroTest::TestRunner describes the objects that check your properties and tells you how to turn
       their control knobs.  You'll want to look here if you're interested in customizing the testing procedure.

       Test::Simple and Test::More explain how to do simple case-based testing in Perl.

       Test::Builder is the test harness upon which this module is built.
