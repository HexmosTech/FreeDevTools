</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements a simple test manager for Badger::Test.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       All methods can be called as class methods or object methods.  In the case of class methods, they are
       called against a prototype object returned by the <b>prototype()</b> method inherited from Badger::Prototype.

   <b>plan($tests)</b>
       How many tests you plan to run.  An error will be thrown if you try to call this method twice.

   <b>result($flag,@args)</b>
       Low-level method to generate a test result.

   <b>ok($flag,</b> <b>$name)</b>
       Report on the success or failure of a test:

           $manager-&gt;ok(1, 'This is good');
           $manager-&gt;ok(0, 'This is bad');

   <b>is($this,</b> <b>$that,</b> <b>$name)</b>
       Test if the first two arguments are equal.

           $manager-&gt;is($this, $that, "This and that are equal");

   <b>isnt($this,</b> <b>$that,</b> <b>$name)</b>
       Test if the first two arguments are not equal.

           $manager-&gt;isnt($this, $that, "This and that are equal");

   <b>like($text,</b> <b>qr/regex/,</b> <b>$name)</b>
       Test if the first argument is matched by the regex passed as the second argument.

           $manager-&gt;like($this, qr/like that/i, "This and that are alike");

   <b>unlike($text,</b> <b>qr/regex/,</b> <b>$name)</b>
       Test if the first argument is not matched by the regex passed as the second argument.

           $manager-&gt;unlike($this, qr/like that/i, "This and that are unalike");

   <b>pass($name)</b>
       Pass a test.

           $manager-&gt;pass('Module Loaded');

   <b>fail($name)</b>
       Fail a test.

           $manager-&gt;fail('Stonehenge crushed by a dwarf');

   <b>skip($reason)</b>
       Skip a single test.

           $manager-&gt;skip("We don't have that piece of scenery any more");

   <b>skip_some($number,$reason)</b>
       Skip a number of tests.

           $manager-&gt;skip_some(11, "We don't have that piece of scenery any more");

   <b>skip_rest(,$reason)</b>
       Skip any remaining tests.

           $manager-&gt;skip_rest("We don't have that piece of scenery any more");

   <b>skip_all($reason)</b>
       Skip all tests.  This should be called instead of <b>plan()</b>

           $manager-&gt;skip_all("We don't have that piece of scenery any more");

   <b>colour($flag)</b>
       Method to enable or disable colour mode.

   <b>color($flag)</b>
       An alias for <b>colour()</b>.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>finish()</b>
       This method is called automatically when the "Badger::Test::Manager" object is destroyed.  It flushes any
       pending tests, performs any final sanity checks and prints a summary if requested.

   <b>flush()</b>
       This methods flushes any cached test results. You don't need to worry about it.

   <b>summary()</b>
       This method generates a final summary of the tests

   <b>test_msg()</b>
       Used to generate the test messages displayed via the Badger::Base <b>messages()</b> method.  The message formats
       are defined in the $MESSAGES package variable.

   <b>test_name()</b>
       Use to generate a name for a test if one isn't explicitly provided.

   <b>different($expect,$result)</b>
       This method is call when a test find a result that doesn't match the expected value.  If
       "Algorithm::Diff" is installed on your machine, it will generate a message showing how the output and
       expected values differ.

       Otherwise it will generate a regular message reporting the mismatch.
