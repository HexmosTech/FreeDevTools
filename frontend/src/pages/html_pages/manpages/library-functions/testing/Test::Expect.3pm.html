</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Expect - Automated driving and testing of terminal-based programs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # in a t/*.t file:
         use Test::Expect;
         use Test::More tests =&gt; 13;
         expect_run(
           command =&gt; ["perl", "testme.pl"],
           prompt  =&gt; 'testme: ',
           quit    =&gt; 'quit',
         );
         expect("ping", "pong", "expect");
         expect_send("ping", "expect_send");
         expect_is("* Hi there, to testme", "expect_is");
         expect_like(qr/Hi there, to testme/, "expect_like");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Expect is a module for automated driving and testing of terminal-based programs.  It is handy for
       testing interactive programs which have a prompt, and is based on the same concepts as the Tcl Expect
       tool.  As in Expect::Simple, the Expect object is made available for tweaking.

       Test::Expect is intended for use in a test script.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>expect_run</b>
       The expect_run subroutine sets up Test::Expect. You must pass in the interactive program to run, what the
       prompt of the program is, and which command quits the program:

         expect_run(
           command =&gt; ["perl", "testme.pl"],
           prompt  =&gt; 'testme: ',
           quit    =&gt; 'quit',
         );

       The "command" may either be a string, or an arrayref of program and arguments; the latter for bypasses
       the shell.

   <b>expect</b>
       The expect subroutine is the catch all subroutine. You pass in the command, the expected output of the
       subroutine and an optional comment.

         expect("ping", "pong", "expect");

   <b>expect_send</b>
       The expect_send subroutine sends a command to the program. You pass in the command and an optional
       comment.

         expect_send("ping", "expect_send");

   <b>expect_is</b>
       The expect_is subroutine tests the output of the program like Test::More's is. It has an optional
       comment:

         expect_is("* Hi there, to testme", "expect_is");

   <b>expect_like</b>
       The expect_like subroutine tests the output of the program like Test::More's like. It has an optional
       comment:

         expect_like(qr/Hi there, to testme/, "expect_like");

   <b>expect_handle</b>
       This returns the Expect object.

   <b>expect_quit</b>
       Closes the Expect handle.
