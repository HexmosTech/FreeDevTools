</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::NoBreakpoints - test that files do not contain soft breakpoints

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Test::NoBreakpoints;
        plan tests =&gt; $num_tests;
        no_breakpoints_ok( $file, 'Contains no soft breakpoints' );

       Module authors can include the following in a t/nobreakpoints.t file to add such checking to a module
       distribution:

         use Test::More;
         eval "use Test::NoBreakpoints 0.10";
         plan skip_all =&gt; "Test::NoBreakpoints 0.10 required for testing" if $@;
         all_files_no_breakpoints_ok();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       I love soft breakpoints ("$DB::single = 1") in the Perl debugger.  Unfortunately, I have a habit of
       putting them in my code during development and forgetting to take them out before I upload it to CPAN,
       necessitating a hasty fix/package/bundle cycle followed by much cursing.

       Test::NoBreakpoints checks that files contain neither the string "$DB::single = 1" nor "$DB::signal = 1".
       By adding such a test to all my modules, I swear less and presumably lighten the load on the CPAN in some
       small way.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Unless otherwise noted, all functions are tests built on top of Test::Builder, so the standard admonition
       about having made a plan before you run them apply.

   <b>no_breakpoints_ok($file,</b> <b>[$description]</b> <b>)</b>
       Checks that $file contains no breakpoints.  If the optional $description is not passed it defaults to "no
       breakpoint test of $file".

       If the test fails, the line number of the file where the breakpoint was found will be emitted.

       For compatibility with old versions of this module, the deprecated name "no_brkpts_ok" may also be used
       (but see "DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS").

   <b>all_perl_files(</b> <b>[@dirs]</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns a list of all <u>*.pl</u>, <u>*.pm</u> and <u>*.t</u> files in the directories listed.  If @dirs is not passed,
       defaults to "blib" and "t".

       The order of the files returned is machine-dependent.  If you want them sorted, you'll have to sort them
       yourself.

   <b>all_files_no_breakpoints_ok(</b> <b>[@files]</b> <b>)</b>
       Checks all files that look like they contain Perl using <b>no_breakpoints_ok()</b>. If @files is not provided,
       it defaults to the return of <b>all_perl_files()</b>.

       For compatibility with old versions of this module, the deprecated name "all_files_no_brkpts_ok" may also
       be used (but see "DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS").

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       By default <b>all_files_no_breakpoints_ok</b> and <b>no_breakpoints_ok</b>.

       For the time being, the deprecated forms the above (<b>all_files_no_brkpts_ok</b> and <b>no_brkpts_ok</b>) are also
       exported (but see "DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS").

       On request, <b>all_perl_files</b>.

       Everything with the tag <b>:all</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATED</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Prior to v0.13 of this module, no_breakpoints_ok was called no_brkpts_ok and all_files_no_breakpoints_ok
       was similarly abbreviated.

       In v0.13, these older names were deprecated.  They are still exported by default, but will emit a warning
       unless you disable the <b>deprecated</b> lexical warning category:

         {
           no warnings 'deprecated';
           no_brkpts_ok(...);
         }

       In the next release, the deprecated functions will have to be pulled in via an import tag.  In the
       release after that, they will cease to be.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       •   doesn't catch some breakpoints

           This is a valid breakpoint:

             package DB;
             $single = 1;
             package main;

           as is this:

             my $break = \$DB::single;
             $$break = 1;

           but neither are currently caught.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       •   enhance regex to find esoteric setting of breakpoints

           If  you have a legitimate breakpoint set that isn't caught, please send me an example and I'll try to
           augment the regex to match it.

       •   only look at code rather than the entire file

           This is not as easy as simply stripping out POD, because there might be inline tests or examples that
           are code in there (using Test::Inline).  Granted, those should be caught when the generated .t  files
           are themselves tested, but I'd like to make it smarter.

       •   not use regular expressions

           The ideal way to find a breakpoint would be to compile the code and then walk the opcode tree to find
           places  where  the breakpoint is set.  B::FindAmpersand does something similar to this to find use of
           the $&amp; in regular expressions, so this is probably the direction I'm going to head in.
