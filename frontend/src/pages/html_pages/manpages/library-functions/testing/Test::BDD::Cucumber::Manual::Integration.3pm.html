       Test::BDD::Cucumber::Manual::Integration - Test suite integration options

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.87

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       How to use Test::BDD::Cucumber in your test suite

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       Test::BDD::Cucumber offers two options to integrate your tests with your test framework:

        1. Integration with C&lt;prove&gt; which will run your .feature
           files as it does .t files
        2. Creation of a .t file which fires off your selected .feature files
           (Test::Builder integration)

       The benefits from using the former approach is that all "prove"'s advanced features like parallel
       testing, randomized order, "--state"ful runs, JUnit output, etc., are available out of the box.

</pre><h4><b>prove</b> <b>integration</b></h4><pre>
       With Test::BDD::Cucumber installed in the Perl search path (PERL5LIB) comes the possibility to run the
       .feature files with a "prove" command directly, by specifying

        $ prove -r
                --source Feature
                --ext=.feature
                --feature-option tags=~@wip
                t/

       This command registers a "prove" plugin named "Feature" associated with the ".feature" extension.
       Additionally, it passes a tag filter to exclude @wip tagged features and scenarios from being run.

       When executed, the command searches the "t/" directory recursively for files with the ".feature"
       extension.  For each directory holding at least one ".feature" file, the step files are loaded from the
       "step_definitions/" subdirectory.

       The command above will find and run <u>only</u> ".feature" files. When you want to run your regular ".t" files
       as well as Test::BDD::Cucumber's ".feature" files, run the following command:

        $ prove -r
                --source Perl
                --ext=.t
                --source Feature
                --ext=.feature
                --feature-option tags=~@wip
                t/

</pre><h4><b>Test::Builder</b> <b>integration</b> <b>--</b> <b>a</b> <b>documented</b> <b>example</b></h4><pre>
       The code below needs to be stored in a ".t" file in the "t/" or "xt/" directory. When done that way, the
       tests are integrated into "make test" as generated from "make test" after "perl Makefile.PL".

        #!perl

        use strict;
        use warnings;

        # This will find step definitions and feature files in the directory you point
        # it at below
        use Test::BDD::Cucumber::Loader;

        # This harness prints out nice TAP
        use Test::BDD::Cucumber::Harness::TAP;

        # Load a directory with Cucumber files in it. It will recursively execute any
        # file matching .*_steps.pl as a Step file, and .*\.feature as a feature file.
        # The features are returned in @features, and the executor is created with the
        # step definitions loaded.
        my ( $executor, @features ) = Test::BDD::Cucumber::Loader-&gt;load(
               't/cucumber_core_features/' );

        # Create a Harness to execute against. TAP harness prints TAP
        my $harness = Test::BDD::Cucumber::Harness::TAP-&gt;new({});

        # For each feature found, execute it, using the Harness to print results
        $executor-&gt;execute( $_, $harness ) for @features;

        # Shutdown gracefully
        $harness-&gt;shutdown();
