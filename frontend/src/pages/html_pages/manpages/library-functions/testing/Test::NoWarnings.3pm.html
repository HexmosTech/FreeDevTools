</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::NoWarnings - Make sure you didn't emit any warnings while testing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       For scripts that have no plan

         use Test::More 'no_plan';
         use Test::NoWarnings;

       that's it, you don't need to do anything else

       For scripts that look like

         use Test::More tests =&gt; x;

       change to

         use Test::More tests =&gt; x + 1;
         use Test::NoWarnings;

       For scripts that use done_testing, use:

         use Test::More;
         use Test::NoWarnings 'had_no_warnings';

         ... # your actual tests

         had_no_warnings;
         done_testing;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In general, your tests shouldn't produce warnings. This modules causes any warnings to be captured and
       stored. It automatically adds an extra test that will run when your script ends to check that there were
       no warnings. If there were any warnings, the test will give a "not ok" and diagnostics of where, when and
       what the warning was, including a stack trace of what was going on when the it occurred.

       If some of your tests <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> produce warnings then you should be capturing and checking them
       with Test::Warn, that way Test::NoWarnings will not see them and so not complain.

       The test is run by an "END" block in Test::NoWarnings. It will not be run when any forked children exit.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Simply by using the module, you automatically get an extra test at the end of your script that checks
       that no warnings were emitted. So just stick

         use Test::NoWarnings;

       at the top of your script and continue as normal.

       If you want more control you can invoke the test manually at any time with "had_no_warnings".

       The warnings your test has generated so far are stored in an array. You can look inside and clear this
       whenever you want with "warnings()" and "clear_warnings", however, if you are doing this sort of thing
       then you probably want to use Test::Warn in combination with Test::NoWarnings.

       If you have a test script written using done_testing and no test plan, you have to call "had_no_warnings"
       before you call done_testing.

   <b>use</b> <b>vs</b> <b>require</b>
       You will almost always want to do

         use Test::NoWarnings;

       If you do a "require" rather than a "use", then there will be no automatic test at the end of your
       script.

   <b>Output</b>
       If warning is captured during your test then the details will output as part of the diagnostics. You will
       get:

       • the number and name of the test that was executed just before the warning (if no test had been executed
         these will be 0 and '')

       • the message passed to "warn",

       • a full dump of the stack when warn was called, courtesy of the "Carp" module

       By default, all warning messages will be emitted in one block at the end of your test script.

   <b>The</b> <b>:early</b> <b>pragma</b>
       One common complaint from people using Test::NoWarnings is that all of the warnings are emitted in one go
       at  the  end.  While  this  is  the  safest  and most correct time to emit these diagnostics, it can make
       debugging these warnings difficult.

       As of Test::NoWarnings 1.04 you can provide an experimental ":early" pragma when loading  the  module  to
       force warnings to be thrown via diag at the time that they actually occur.

         use Test::NoWarnings ':early';

       As  this will cause the diag to be emitted against the previous test and not the one in which the warning
       actually occurred it is recommended that the pragma be turned on only for debugging and left off when not
       needed.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>had_no_warnings</b>
       This checks that there have been warnings emitted by your test scripts.  Usually you will not  call  this
       explicitly as it is called automatically when your script finishes.

   <b>clear_warnings</b>
       This  will  clear  the  array  of  warnings that have been captured. If the array is empty then a call to
       "had_no_warnings()" will produce a pass result.

   <b>warnings</b>
       This will return the array of warnings captured  so  far.  Each  element  of  this  array  is  an  object
       containing information about the warning. The following methods are available on these object.

       • $warn-&gt;getMessage

         Get the message that would been printed by the warning.

       • $warn-&gt;getCarp

         Get  a  stack  trace  of what was going on when the warning happened, this stack trace is just a string
         generated by the Carp module.

       • $warn-&gt;getTrace

         Get a stack trace object  generated  by  the  Devel::StackTrace  module.  This  will  return  undef  if
         Devel::StackTrace is not installed.

       • $warn-&gt;getTest

         Get the number of the test that executed before the warning was emitted.

       • $warn-&gt;getTestName

         Get the name of the test that executed before the warning was emitted.

</pre><h4><b>PITFALLS</b></h4><pre>
       When counting your tests for the plan, don't forget to include the test that runs automatically when your
       script ends.

       Checking  for  warnings  is  done using $SIG{__WARN__}.  If other modules use this hook, it can interfere
       with this module's operation.  For example, using the Carp::Always  module  will  cause  this  module  to
       always report no warnings.
