</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Effects::ONLY - Lexically set Test::Effects verbosity

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Test::Effects::ONLY version 0.000001

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           {
               use Test::Effects::ONLY;
               # Test::Effects defaults to only testing specified effects in this scope

               {
                   no Test::Effects::ONLY;
                   # Test::Effects defaults to testing all effects in this scope
               }

               # Test::Effects still only testing specified effects here

           }
           # Test::Effects reverts to original behaviour here

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Using this module changes the default behaviour of Test::Effects's "effects_ok()" test.

       Normally this test tests all side-effects, even those unspecified (unless explicitly told otherwise via
       the use of "ONLY()"). If this module is used in a code block, "effects_ok()" defaults to only running
       specified tests for the remainder of that block's lexical scope.

       Note, however, that an explicit "ONLY =&gt; $boolean" option in any call to "&lt;effects_ok()" overrides this
       lexical default.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"use</b> <b>Test::Effects::ONLY;"</b>
       "effects_ok" defaults to only runnign specified test within the rest of the current lexical scope.

   <b>"no</b> <b>Test::Effects::ONLY;"</b>
       "effects_ok" defaults to running all tests (including unspecified ones) within the rest of the current
       lexical scope.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Effects::ONLY requires no configuration files or environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       Requires Perl 5.14 (or better).

       Does not require, but is meaningless without, the Test::Effects module.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       No bugs have been reported.
