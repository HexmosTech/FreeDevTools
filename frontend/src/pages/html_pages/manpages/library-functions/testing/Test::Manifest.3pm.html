       Test::Manifest - interact with a t/test_manifest file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               # in Makefile.PL
               eval "use Test::Manifest 2.00";

               # in Build.PL
               my $class = do {
                       if( eval 'use Test::Manifest 2.00; 1' ) {
                               Test::Manifest-&gt;get_module_build_subclass;
                               }
                       else {
                               'Module::Build';
                               }
                       };

               my $build = $class-&gt;new( ... )

               # in the file t/test_manifest, list the tests you want
               # to run in the order you want to run them

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Test::Harness" assumes that you want to run all of the <u>.t</u> files in the <u>t/</u> directory in ASCII-betical
       order during "make test" or "./Build test" unless you say otherwise.  This leads to some interesting
       naming schemes for test files to get them in the desired order. These interesting names ossify when they
       get into source control, and get even more interesting as more tests show up.

       "Test::Manifest" overrides the default test file order. Instead of running all of the <u>t/*.t</u> files in
       ASCII-betical order, it looks in the <u>t/test_manifest</u> file to find out which tests you want to run and the
       order in which you want to run them.  It constructs the right value for the build system to do the right
       thing.

       In <u>t/test_manifest</u>, simply list the tests that you want to run.  Their order in the file is the order in
       which they run.  You can comment lines with a "#", just like in Perl, and "Test::Manifest" will strip
       leading and trailing whitespace from each line.  It also checks that the specified file is actually in
       the <u>t/</u> directory.  If the file does not exist, it does not put its name in the list of test files to run
       and it will issue a warning.

       Optionally, you can add a number after the test name in test_manifest to define sets of tests. See
       "get_t_files" for more information.

   <b>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</b>
       To override the test order behaviour in "MakeMaker", "Test::Manifest" inserts itself in the
       "test_via_harness" step by providing its own test runner. In "Makefile.PL", all you have to do is load
       "Test::Manifest" before you call "WriteMakefile". To make it optional, load it in an eval:

               eval "use Test::Manifest";

   <b>Module::Build</b>
       Overriding parts of "Module::Build" is tricker if you want to use the subclassing mechanism and still
       make "Test::Manifest" optional. If you can load "Test::Manifest" (version 2.00 or later),
       "Test::Manifest" can create the subclass for you.

               my $class = do {
                       if( eval 'use Test::Manifest 2.00; 1' ) {
                               Test::Manifest-&gt;get_module_build_subclass;
                               }
                       else {
                               'Module::Build' # if Test::Manifest isn't there
                               }
                       };

               $class-&gt;new( ... );
               $class-&gt;create_build_file;

       This is a bit of a problem when you already have your own subclass.  "Test::Manifest" overrides
       "find_test_files", so you can get just that code to add to your own subclass code string:

               my $code = eval 'use Test::Manifest 2.00; 1'
                               ?
                       Test::Manifest-&gt;get_module_build_code_string
                               :
                       '';

               my $class = Module::Build-&gt;subclass(
                       ...,
                       code =&gt; "$code\n...your subclass code string...",
                       );

   <b>Class</b> <b>methods</b>
       get_module_build_subclass
           For "Module::Build" only.

           Returns  a  "Module::Build"  subclass  that overrides "find_test_files". If you want to have your own
           "Module::Build" subclass and still use "Test::Manifest", you  can  get  just  the  code  string  with
           "get_module_build_code_string".

       get_module_build_code_string
           For "Module::Build" only.

           Returns  the  overridden  "find_test_files"  as  Perl code in a string suitable for the "code" key in
           "Module::Build-"<b>subclass()</b>&gt;. You can add this to other bits you are overriding or extending.

           See "Module::Build::Base::find_test_files" to see the base implementation.

   <b>Functions</b>
       run_t_manifest( TEST_VERBOSE, INST_LIB, INST_ARCHLIB, TEST_LEVEL )
           For "MakeMaker" only. You don't have to mess with this at the user level.

           Run all of the files in <u>t/test_manifest</u> through "Test::Harness:runtests" in the order they appear  in
           the file. This is inserted automatically

                   eval "use Test::Manifest";

       get_t_files( [LEVEL] )
           In  scalar  context  it returns a single string that you can use directly in WriteMakefile(). In list
           context it returns a list of the files it found in <u>t/test_manifest</u>.

           If a <u>t/test_manifest</u> file does not exist, get_t_files() returns nothing.

           get_t_files() warns you if it can't find <u>t/test_manifest</u>, or if entries start with <u>t/</u>. It skips blank
           lines, and strips Perl style comments from the file.

           Each line in <u>t/test_manifest</u> can have three parts: the test name, the test level  (a  floating  point
           number), and a comment. By default, the test level is 1.

                   test_name.t 2  #Run this only for level 2 testing

           Without an argument, get_t_files() returns all the test files it finds. With an argument that is true
           (so  you  can't  use  0  as  a  level) and is a number, it skips tests with a level greater than that
           argument. You can then define sets of tests and choose a set to run. For instance, you might create a
           set for end users, but also add on a set for deeper testing for developers.

           Experimentally, you can include a command to grab test names from another file.  The  command  starts
           with  a  ";"  to  distinguish  it  from  a true filename. The filename (currently) is relative to the
           current working directory, unlike the filenames, which are relative to "t/".  The  filenames  in  the
           included are still relative to "t/".

                   ;include t/file_with_other_test_names.txt

           Also experimentally, you can stop "Test::Manifest" from reading filenames with the ";skip" directive.
           "Test::Manifest" will skip the filenames up to the ";unskip" directive (or end of file):

                   run_this1
                   ;skip
                   skip_this
                   ;unskip
                   run_this2

           To select sets of tests, specify the level in the environment variable "TEST_LEVEL":

                   make test # run all tests no matter the level
                   make test TEST_LEVEL=2  # run all tests level 2 and below

           Eventually this will end up as an option to <u>Build.PL</u>:

                   ./Build test --testlevel=2  # Not yet supported

       <b>make_test_manifest()</b>
           Creates the test_manifest file in the t directory by reading the contents of the <u>t/</u> directory.

           TO DO: specify tests in argument lists.

           TO DO: specify files to skip.

       <b>manifest_name()</b>
           Returns the name of the test manifest file, relative to <u>t/</u>.
