           my @results = Zonemaster::Engine::TestMethodsV2-&gt;get_parent_ns_ips($zone);

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>

       get_parent_ns_ips($zone)
           [External]

           This  Method  will  obtain the name servers that serves the parent zone, i.e. the zone from which the
           Child Zone is delegated from.

           Takes a Zonemaster::Engine::Zone object.

           Returns an arrayref of Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver objects, or  "undef"  if  no  parent  zone  was
           found.

       _get_oob_ips($zone, $ns_names_ref)
           [Internal]

           This  Method will obtain the IP addresses of the Out-Of-Bailiwick name servers for the given zone and
           a given set of name server names.

           Takes a Zonemaster::Engine::Zone object and an arrayref of Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver objects.

           Returns an arrayref of Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver objects for each  name  server  name  that  was
           successfully  resolved to an IP address, and Zonemaster::Engine::DNSName objects for each name server
           name that could not be resolved to an IP address.

       _get_delegation($zone)
           [Internal]

           This Method will obtain the name server names (from the NS records) and the IP addresses  (from  Glue
           records)  from  the  delegation  of  the  given  zone from the parent zone.  Glue Records are address
           records for In-Bailiwick name server names, if any.

           Takes a Zonemaster::Engine::Zone object.

           Returns an arrayref of Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver objects, or  "undef"  if  no  parent  zone  was
           found.

       get_del_ns_names_and_ips($zone)
           [External]

           This  Method  will obtain the name server names (from the NS records) and the IP addresses (from Glue
           Records) from the delegation of the given zone from the parent  zone.   Glue  Records,  if  any,  are
           address  records  for  name  server names. Also obtain the IP addresses for the Out-Of-Bailiwick name
           server names, if any.  If the Glue Records include address records for Out-Of-Bailiwick name  servers
           they will be included twice, unless identical.

           Takes a Zonemaster::Engine::Zone object.

           Returns  an  arrayref  of  Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver  objects for each name server name that was
           successfully resolved to an IP address, and Zonemaster::Engine::DNSName objects for each name  server
           name that could not be resolved to an IP address, or "undef" if no parent zone was found.

       get_del_ns_names($zone)
           [External]

           This  Method  will  obtain  the name server names of the given zone as defined in the delegation from
           parent zone.

           Takes a Zonemaster::Engine::Zone object.

           Returns an arrayref of strings, or "undef" if no parent zone was found.

       get_del_ns_ips($zone)
           [External]

           This Method will obtain the IP addresses (from Glue Records) from the delegation of  the  given  zone
           from  the  parent zone.  Glue Records are address records for In-Bailiwick name server names, if any.
           Also obtain the IP addresses for the Out-Of-Bailiwick name server names, if any.

           Takes a Zonemaster::Engine::Zone object.

           Returns an arrayref of strings, or "undef" if no parent zone was found.

       get_zone_ns_names($zone)
           [External]

           This Method will obtain the names of the authoritative name servers for the given zone as defined  in
           the NS records in the zone itself.

           Takes a Zonemaster::Engine::Zone object.

           Returns an arrayref of strings, or "undef" if no parent zone was found.

       _get_ib_addr_in_zone($zone)
           [Internal]

           This  Method  will  obtain  the  address records matching the In-Bailiwick name server names from the
           given zone.

           Takes a Zonemaster::Engine::Zone object.

           Returns an arrayref of Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver objects, or  "undef"  if  no  parent  zone  was
           found.

       get_zone_ns_names_and_ips($zone)
           [External]

           This  Method  will  obtain the name server names (extracted from the NS records) from the apex of the
           given zone.  For the In-Bailiwick name server names obtain the IP addresses from the given zone.  For
           the Out-Of-Bailiwick name server names obtain the IP addresses from recursive lookup.

           Takes a Zonemaster::Engine::Zone object.

           Returns  an  arrayref  of  Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver  objects for each name server name that was
           successfully resolved to an IP address, and Zonemaster::Engine::DNSName objects for each name  server
           name that could not be resolved to an IP address, or "undef" if no parent zone was found.

       get_zone_ns_ips($zone)
           [External]

           This  Method  will  obtain  the IP addresses of the name servers, as extracted from the NS records of
           apex of the given zone.

           Takes a Zonemaster::Engine::Zone object.

           Returns an arrayref of strings, or "undef" if no parent zone was found.
