</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Dependencies - Ensure that the dependency listing is complete

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.34

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       In your t/00-dependencies.t:

           use CPAN::Meta;  # or CPAN::Meta::cpanfile
           use File::Find::Rule::Perl;

           use Test::More;
           use Test::Dependencies '0.28' forward_compatible =&gt; 1;

           my $meta = CPAN::Meta-&gt;load_file('META.json'); # or META.yml
           plan skip_all =&gt; 'No META.json' if ! $meta;

           my @files = File::Find::Rule::Perl-&gt;perl_files-&gt;in('.<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>', '.<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>');
           ok_dependencies($meta, \@files, [qw/runtime configure build test/],
                           undef, # all features in the cpanfile
                           ignores =&gt; [ qw/ Your::Namespace Some::Other::Namespace / ]
           );

           done_testing;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Makes sure that all of the modules that are 'use'd are listed in the Makefile.PL as dependencies.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DEPRECATED</b> You can pass options to the module via the 'use' line.  These options will be moved to the
       <b>ok_dependencies()</b> function.  The available options are:

       forward_compatible
           When  specified  and  true,  stops  the  module  from outputting a plan, which is the default mode of
           operation when the module becomes 1.0.

       exclude
           Specifies the list of namespaces for which it is ok not to have specified dependencies.

       style
           <b>DEPRECATED</b>

           There used to be the option of specifying a style; the  heavy  style  depended  on  B::PerlReq.  This
           module stopped working somewhere around Perl 5.20. Specifying a style no longer has any effect.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTED</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ok_dependencies($meta,</b> <b>$files,</b> <b>$phases,</b> <b>$features,</b> <b>%options)</b>
        $meta is a CPAN::Meta object
        $files is an arrayref with files to be scanned

       <u>%options</u> <u>keys</u>

       phases
           This  is an arrayref holding one or more names of phases as defined by CPAN::Meta::Spec, or undef for
           all

       features
           This is an arrayref holding zero or more names of features, or undef for all

       ignores
           This is a arrayref listing the names of modules (and their sub-namespaces) for which no errors are to
           be reported.

   <b>ok_dependencies()</b>
       <b>Deprecated.</b> Legacy invocation to be removed. In previous versions, this function would  scan  the  <u>entire</u>
       bin/,  lib/  and  t/  subtrees,  with  the exception of a few sub-directories known to be used by version
       control systems.

       This behaviour has been changed: as of 0.20, Find::File::Rule::Perl is being  used  to  find  Perl  files
       (*.pl, *.pm, *.t and those starting with a shebang line referring to perl).
