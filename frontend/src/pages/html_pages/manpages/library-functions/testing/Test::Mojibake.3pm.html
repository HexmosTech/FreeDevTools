</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Mojibake - check your source for encoding misbehavior.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.3

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # Test::Mojibake lets you check for inconsistencies in source/documentation encoding, and report its results in standard Test::Simple fashion.
           no strict 'vars';

           use Test::Mojibake;
           file_encoding_ok($file, 'Valid encoding');
           done_testing($num_tests);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Many modern text editors automatically save files using UTF-8 codification, however, perl interpreter
       does not expects it <u>by</u> <u>default</u>. Whereas this does not represent a big deal on (most) backend-oriented
       programs, Web framework (Catalyst &lt;<a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">http://www.catalystframework.org/</a>&gt;, Mojolicious
       &lt;<a href="http://mojolicio.us/">http://mojolicio.us/</a>&gt;) based applications will suffer of so-called Mojibake
       &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake</a>&gt; (lit. "unintelligible sequence of characters").

       Even worse: if an editor saves BOM (Byte Order Mark, "U+FEFF" character in Unicode) at the start of the
       script with executable bit set (on Unix systems), it won't execute at all, due to shebang corruption.

       Avoiding codification problems is quite simple:

       •   Always "use utf8"/"use common::sense" when saving source as UTF-8;

       •   Always specify "=encoding UTF-8" when saving POD as UTF-8;

       •   Do neither of above when saving as ISO-8859-1;

       •   <b>Never</b>  save  BOM  (not  that  it's wrong; just avoid it as you'll barely notice it's presence when in
           trouble).

       However, if you find yourself upgrading old code to use UTF-8 or trying to standardize a big project with
       many developers each one using a different platform/editor, reviewing all files  manually  can  be  quite
       painful. Specially in cases when some files have multiple encodings (note: it all started when I realized
       that <u>Gedit</u> &amp; derivatives are unable to open files with character conversion tables).

       Enter the Test::Mojibake ";)"

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>file_encoding_ok(</b> <b>FILENAME[,</b> <b>TESTNAME</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       Validates the codification of "FILENAME".

       When it fails, "file_encoding_ok()" will report the probable cause.

       The  optional second argument "TESTNAME" is the name of the test.  If it is omitted, "file_encoding_ok()"
       chooses a default test name "Mojibake test for FILENAME".

   <b>all_files_encoding_ok(</b> <b>[@entries]</b> <b>)</b>
       Validates codification of all the files under @entries. It runs "all_files()" on directories and  assumes
       everything  else  to  be  a  file to be tested. It calls the "plan()" function for you (one test for each
       file), so you can't have already called "plan".

       If @entries is empty or not passed, the function finds all source/documentation files  in  files  in  the
       <u>blib</u>  directory  if  it exists, or the <u>lib</u> directory if not. A source/documentation file is one that ends
       with <u>.pod</u>, <u>.pl</u> and <u>.pm</u>, or any file where the first line looks like a shebang line.

   <b>all_files(</b> <b>[@dirs]</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns a list of all the Perl files in <u>@dirs</u> and in directories below. If no directories are passed,  it
       defaults  to  <u>blib</u>  if  <u>blib</u>  exists,  or else <u>lib</u> if not. Skips any files in CVS, .svn, .git and similar
       directories. See %Test::Mojibake::ignore_dirs for a list of them.

       A Perl file is:

       •   Any file that ends in <u>.PL</u>, <u>.pl</u>, <u>.pm</u>, <u>.pod</u>, or <u>.t</u>;

       •   Any file that has a first line with a shebang and "perl" on it;

       •   Any file that ends in <u>.bat</u> and has a first line with "--*-Perl-*--" on it.

       The order of the files returned is machine-dependent.  If you want them sorted, you'll have to sort  them
       yourself.

   <b>_detect_utf8(</b> <b>\$string</b> <b>)</b>
       Detects presence of UTF-8 encoded characters in a referenced octet stream.

       Return codes:

       •   0 - 8-bit characters detected, does not validate as UTF-8;

       •   1 - only 7-bit characters;

       •   2 - 8-bit characters detected, validates as UTF-8.

       Unicode::CheckUTF8  is highly recommended, however, it is optional and this function will fallback to the
       Pure        Perl        implementation         of         the         following         PHP         code:
       &lt;<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.utf8-encode.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.utf8-encode.php</a>#85293&gt;

</pre><h4><b>SAMPLE</b> <b>TEST</b> <b>SCRIPT</b></h4><pre>
       Module  authors  can  include  the following in a <u>t/mojibake.t</u> file and have Test::Mojibake automatically
       find and check all source files in a module distribution:

           #!perl -T
           use strict;

           BEGIN {
               unless ($ENV{RELEASE_TESTING}) {
                   require Test::More;
                   Test::More::plan(skip_all =&gt; 'these tests are for release candidate testing');
               }
           }

           use Test::More;

           eval 'use Test::Mojibake';
           plan skip_all =&gt; 'Test::Mojibake required for source encoding testing' if $@;

           all_files_encoding_ok();

</pre><h4><b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Mojibake validates codification of both source  (Perl  code)  and  documentation  (POD).  Both  are
       assumed to be encoded in ISO-8859-1 (aka latin1). Perl switches to UTF-8 through the statement:

        use utf8;

       or:

        use utf8::all;

       or even:

        use common::sense;

       Similarly, POD encoding can be changed via:

        =encoding UTF-8

       Correspondingly, "no utf8"/"=encoding latin1" put Perl back into ISO-8859-1 mode.

       Actually,  Test::Mojibake  only  cares  about UTF-8, as it is roughly safe to be detected. So, when UTF-8
       characters are detected without preceding declaration, an error is reported. On the other way,  non-UTF-8
       characters in UTF-8 mode are wrong, either.

       If  present,  Unicode::CheckUTF8 module (XS wrapper) will be used to validate UTF-8 strings, note that it
       is  <b>30</b>  <b>times</b>  <b>faster</b>  and  a  lot  more  Unicode  Consortium  compliant  than  the  built-in  Pure  Perl
       implementation!

       UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) is also detected as an error. While Perl is OK handling BOM, your OS probably
       isn't. Check out:

        ./bom.pl: line 1: $'\357\273\277#!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>': command not found

   <b>Caveats</b>
       Whole-line source comments, like:

        # this is a whole-line comment...
        print "### hello world ###\n"; # ...and this os not

       are not checked at all. This is mainly because many scripts/modules do contain authors' names in headers,
       <b>before</b>  the proper encoding specification. So, if you happen to have some acutes/umlauts in your name and
       your editor sign your code in the similar way, you probably won't be happy with  Test::Mojibake  flooding
       you with (false) error messages.

       If  you  are  wondering  why  only  whole-line  comments are stripped, check the second line of the above
       example.
