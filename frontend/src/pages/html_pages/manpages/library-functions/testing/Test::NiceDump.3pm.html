</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::NiceDump - let's have a nice and human readable dump of our objects!

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.0.1

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Test::Deep;
           use Test::NiceDump 'nice_explain';

           cmp_deeply($got,$expected,'it works')
               or nice_explain($got,$expected);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module uses "Data::Dump::Filtered" and a set of sensible filters to dump test data in a more
       readable way.

       For example, "DateTime" objects get printed in the full ISO 8601 format, and "DBIx::Class::Row" objects
       get printed as hashes of their inflated columns.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"nice_dump"</b>
           my $dumped_string = nice_dump $data;

       Serialise $data in a nice, readable way.

   <b>"nice_explain"</b>
           nice_explain $data;
           nice_explain $data, $comparator;

       Calls ""nice_dump"" on $data and $comparator (if provided), and uses "diag" to provide test failure
       feedback with the dumped strings.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>ADD</b> <b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       If the built-in filtering of input data is not enough for you, you can add extra filters. A filter is a
       coderef that takes a single argument (the value to be dumped), and returns either:

       nothing at all
           to signal that it won't handle this particular value

       any single value
           which will be dumped instead

       Let's  say  you  have  a class "My::Class", and you don't want its instances to be dumped directly (maybe
       they contain cached data that's not very useful to see). That class may have a  "as_data_for_log"  method
       that  returns  only  the important bits of data (as a hashref, probably), so you want the return value of
       that method to be dumped instead. You could say:

           use Safe::Isa;

           Test::NiceDump::add_filter(
               my_filter =&gt; sub {
                   $_[0]-&gt;$_isa('My::Class')
                       ? $_[0]-&gt;as_data_for_log
                       : ();
               },
           );

       or, if you want to do the same for any object with that method:

           use Safe::Isa;

           Test::NiceDump::add_filter(
               my_filter =&gt; sub { $_[0]-&gt;$_call_if_can('as_data_for_log') },
           );

   <b>"add_filter"</b>
         Test::NiceDump::add_filter($name =&gt; $code);

       Adds a new filter. Adding a filter with an existing name overrides it.

       Filters  are  invoked  in  "cmp"  order  of   name.   The   names   of   all   built-in   filters   match
       "/^Test::NiceDump::/".

       Try to be specific with your checks, to avoid surprises due to the interaction of different filters.

       Your filter <u>must</u> return nothing at all if it didn't handle the value. Failure to do so will probably lead
       to infinite recursion.

   <b>"remove_filter"</b>
         Test::NiceDump::remove_filter($name);

       Removes the filter with the given name. Nothing happens if such a filter does not exist.
