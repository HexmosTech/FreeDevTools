</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Modern - precision testing for modern perl

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use Test::Modern;

          # Your tests here

          done_testing;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Modern provides the best features of Test::More, Test::Fatal, Test::Warnings, Test::API,
       Test::LongString, and Test::Deep, as well as ideas from Test::Requires, Test::DescribeMe, Test::Moose,
       and Test::CleanNamespaces.

       Test::Modern also automatically imposes strict and warnings on your script, and loads IO::File. (Much of
       the same stuff Modern::Perl does.)

       Although Test::Modern is a modern testing framework, it should run fine on pre-modern versions of Perl.
       It should be easy to install on Perl 5.8.9 and above; and if you can persuade its dependencies to install
       (not necessarily easy!), should be OK on anything back to Perl 5.6.1.

   <b>Features</b> <b>from</b> <b>Test::More</b>
       Test::Modern exports the following subs from Test::More:

       "ok($truth, $description)"
       "is($got, $expected, $description)"
       "isnt($got, $unexpected, $description)"
       "like($got, $regexp, $description)"
       "unlike($got, $regexp, $description)"
       "is_deeply($got, $expected, $description)"
       "cmp_ok($got, $operator, $expected, $description)"
       "new_ok($class, \@args, $name)"
       "isa_ok($object|$subclass, $class, $name)"
       "can_ok($object|$class, @methods)"
       pass($description)
       fail($description)
       "subtest($description, sub { ... })"
       diag(@messages)
       note(@messages)
       explain(@messages)
       "skip($why, $count) if $reason"
       "todo_skip($why, $count) if $reason"
       $TODO
       plan(%plan)
       "done_testing"
       BAIL_OUT($reason)

       The  "use_ok",  "require_ok",  "eq_array",  "eq_hash", and "eq_set" functions are also available, but not
       exported by default. For "use_ok" and "require_ok" it's normally better to use the Perl  built-ins  "use"
       and "require" which will die (failing your test) if things are not OK. For the "eq_*" functions, they can
       usually be replaced by "is_deeply".

   <b>Features</b> <b>from</b> <b>Test::Fatal</b>
       Test::Modern exports the following subs from Test::Fatal:

       "exception { BLOCK }"

   <b>Features</b> <b>from</b> <b>Test::Warnings</b>
       Test::Modern exports the following subs from Test::Warnings:

       "warning { BLOCK }"
       "warnings { BLOCK }"

       In addition, Test::Modern always enables the "had_no_warnings" test at the end of the file, ensuring that
       your  test  script  generated  no  warnings  other than the expected ones which were caught by "warnings"
       blocks.  (See also "PERL_TEST_MODERN_ALLOW_WARNINGS" in "ENVIRONMENT".)

       Test::Modern can also export an additional function for testing warnings,  but  does  not  export  it  by
       default:

       "shouldnt_warn { BLOCK }"
           Runs  a  block  of  code  that  will  hopefully  not warn, but might. Tests that it doesn't warn, but
           performs that test as a "todo" test, so if it fails, your test suite can still pass.

   <b>Features</b> <b>from</b> <b>Test::API</b>
       Test::Modern exports the following subs from Test::API:

       "public_ok($package, @functions)"
       "import_ok($package, export =&gt; \@functions, export_ok =&gt; \@functions)"
       "class_api_ok($class, @methods)"

   <b>Features</b> <b>from</b> <b>Test::LongString</b>
       Test::Modern exports the following subs from Test::LongString:

       "is_string($got, $expected, $description)"
       "is_string_nows($got, $expected, $description)"
       "like_string($got, $regexp, $description)"
       "unlike_string($got, $regexp, $description)"
       "contains_string($haystack, $needle, $description)"
       "lacks_string($haystack, $needle, $description)"

       Actually  Test::Modern  provides  these  via  a  wrapper.  If  Test::LongString  is  not  installed  then
       Test::Modern will provide a fallback implementation using Test::More's "is", "isnt", "like", and "unlike"
       functions. (The diagnostics won't be as good in the case of failures.)

   <b>Features</b> <b>from</b> <b>Test::Deep</b>
       Test::Modern exports the following subs from Test::Deep:

       "cmp_deeply($got, $expected, $description)"

       The following are not exported by default, but can be exported upon request:

       ignore()
       methods(%hash)
       listmethods(%hash)
       shallow($thing)
       noclass($thing)
       useclass($thing)
       "re($regexp, $capture_data, $flags)"
       superhashof(\%hash)
       subhashof(\%hash)
       bag(@elements)
       set(@elements)
       superbagof(@elements)
       subbagof(@elements)
       supersetof(@elements)
       subsetof(@elements)
       all(@expecteds)
       any(@expecteds)
       obj_isa($class)
       array_each($thing)
       str($string)
       "num($number, $tolerance)"
       bool($value)
       code(\&amp;subref)

       As  an alternative to using those functions, Test::Modern exports a constant "TD" upon which you can call
       them as methods:

          # like Test::Deep::bag(@elements)
          TD-&gt;bag(@elements)

   <b>Features</b> <b>from</b> <b>Test::Pod</b> <b>and</b> <b>Test::Pod::Coverage</b>
       <b>These</b> <b>features</b> <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> <b>considered</b> <b>experimental.</b> <b>They</b> <b>may</b>  <b>be</b>  <b>removed</b>  <b>from</b>  <b>a</b>  <b>future</b>  <b>version</b>  <b>of</b>
       <b>Test::Modern.</b>

       Test::Modern  can  export  the following subs from Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage, though they are not
       exported by default:

       "pod_file_ok($file, $description)"
       all_pod_files_ok(@dirs)
       "pod_coverage_ok($module, $params, $description)"
       "all_pod_coverage_ok($params, $description)"

       In fact, Test::Modern wraps these tests in checks to see whether Test::Pod(::Coverage) is installed,  and
       the  state  of  the "RELEASE_TESTING", "AUTHOR_TESTING", and "EXTENDED_TESTING" environment variables. If
       none of  those  environment  variables  is  set  to  true,  then  the  test  is  skipped  altogether.  If
       Test::Pod(::Coverage)  is  not  installed, then the test is skipped, unless "RELEASE_TESTING" is true, in
       which case <u>Test::Pod(::Coverage)</u> <u>must</u> <u>be</u> <u>installed</u>.

       This is usually a pretty sensible behaviour. You want authors to be made aware of pod errors if possible.
       You want to make sure they are tested before doing a  release.  End  users  probably  don't  want  a  pod
       formatting  error  to  prevent  them  from  installing  the  software,  unless  they  opt  into  it using
       "EXTENDED_TESTING".

       Also, Test::Modern wraps the "all_*" functions to run them in  a  subtest  (because  otherwise  they  can
       interfere with your test plans).

   <b>Features</b> <b>from</b> <b>Test::Version</b>
       <b>These</b>  <b>features</b>  <b>are</b>  <b>currently</b>  <b>considered</b>  <b>experimental.</b>  <b>They</b>  <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b>
       <b>Test::Modern.</b>

       Test::Modern can export the following subs from Test::Version, though they are not exported by default:

       "version_ok($file, $description)"
       version_all_ok(@dirs)

       These are wrapped similarly to those described in the "Features from Test::Pod and Test::Coverage".

       Test::Modern can also export another sub based on "version_all_ok":

       version_all_same(@dirs)
           Acts like "version_all_ok" but also checks that all modules have the same version number.

   <b>Features</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> <b>Test::Moose</b>
       Test::Modern does not use Test::Moose, but does provide the following function inspired by it:

       "does_ok($object|$subclass, $class, $name)"
           Like "isa_ok", but calls "$obj-&gt;DOES" instead of "$obj-&gt;isa".

   <b>Features</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> <b>Test::CleanNamespaces</b>
       Test::Modern does not use Test::CleanNamespaces, but does provide the following function inspired by it:

       namespaces_clean(@namespaces)
           Tests that namespaces don't contain any imported  functions.  (i.e.  you  haven't  forgotten  to  use
           namespace::autoclean or namespace::sweep in a class).

           Unlike the version of this function supplied with Test::CleanNamespaces, if @namespaces contains more
           than one namespace, these will be run in a subtest, so the whole thing will only count as one test.

   <b>Features</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> <b>Test::Benchmark</b>
       Test::Modern does not use Test::Benchmark, but does provide the following feature inspired by it:

       "is_fastest($implementation, $times, \%implementations, $desc)"
              use Test::Modern qw( is_fastest );

              is_fastest("speedy", -1, {
                 "speedy"     =&gt; sub { ... },
                 "slowcoach"  =&gt; sub { ... },
              });

           This  ensures  that  the  named  coderef  runs  the  fastest out of a hashref of alternatives. The -1
           parameter in the example is the number of times to run the coderefs (see Benchmark for more  details,
           including how numbers less than zero are interpreted).

       <b>Caveat:</b>  on fast computers, a set of coderefs that you might expect to differ in speed might all run in a
       negligible period of time, and thus be rounded to zero, in which case your test case could randomly fail.
       Use this test with caution!

       <b>Caveat</b> <b>the</b> <b>second:</b> these tests tend to be slow. Use sparingly.

       Because of the aforementioned caveats, it is a good idea to move your benchmarking  tests  into  separate
       test  scripts,  keeping  an  imaginary  wall  between  them  and the bulk of your test suite (which tests
       correctness rather than speed).

       Test::Modern provides an import hint suitable for including at the top of  these  benchmarking  tests  to
       mark them as being primarily concerned with speed:

          use Test::Modern -benchmark;

       This  will  not only import the "is_fastest" function, but will also <u>skip</u> <u>the</u> <u>entire</u> <u>script</u> unless one of
       the "EXTENDED_TESTING" or "RELEASE_TESTING" environment variables is set.

   <b>Features</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> <b>Test::Requires</b>
       Test::Modern does not use Test::Requires, but does provide the following feature inspired by it:

       "use Test::Modern -requires =&gt; \%requirements"
           This will skip the entire test script if the requirements are not met.  For example:

              use Test::Modern -requires =&gt; {
                 'perl'                 =&gt; '5.010',
                 'Moose'                =&gt; '2.11',
                 'namespace::autoclean' =&gt; undef,
              };

   <b>Features</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> <b>Test::RequiresInternet</b>
       Similarly you can skip the test script if an Internet connection is not available:

          use Test::Modern -internet;

       You can check for the ability to connect to particular hosts and ports:

          use Test::Modern -internet =&gt; [
             'www.example.com'  =&gt; 'http',
             '8.8.8.8'          =&gt; 53,
          ];

       Test::Modern does not use Test::RequiresInternet but I've stolen much of the latter's implementation.

   <b>Features</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> <b>Test::Without::Module</b>
       Test::Modern does not use Test::Without::Module, but does provide the following feature inspired by it:

       "use Test::Modern -without =&gt; \@modules"
           This will run the tests as if the module was not installed. Useful for testing things in the  absence
           of optional dependencies. For example:

              use Test::Modern -without =&gt; [ "Class::XSAccessor" ];

           It  cannot  suppress  modules from being loaded if they are required by Test::Modern itself. To get a
           list of what modules Test::Modern requires, run the following command:

              perl -MTest::Modern -le'print for sort keys %INC'

           (Note that the actual implementation is mostly stolen from Devel::Hide which seems to  behave  better
           than Test::Without::Module.)

   <b>Features</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> <b>Test::DescribeMe</b>
       These  export  tags  allow you to classify tests as "author tests", "release tests", "extended tests", or
       "interactive tests".

       They will cause your test script to be skipped depending on various environment variables.

       "use Test::Modern -author"
       "use Test::Modern -release"
       "use Test::Modern -extended"
       "use Test::Modern -interactive"

   <b>Features</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> <b>Test::Lib</b>
       <b>These</b> <b>features</b> <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> <b>considered</b> <b>experimental.</b> <b>They</b> <b>may</b>  <b>be</b>  <b>removed</b>  <b>from</b>  <b>a</b>  <b>future</b>  <b>version</b>  <b>of</b>
       <b>Test::Modern.</b>

       Test::Modern tries to find a directory called "t/lib" by traversing up the directory tree from the caller
       file. If found, this directory will be added to @INC.

       Test::Lib  would croak if such a directory cannot be found.  Test::Modern carries on if it can't find it.
       If you want something more like the Test::Lib behaviour, use the "-lib" import tag:

          use Test::Modern -lib;

   <b>Brand</b> <b>Spanking</b> <b>New</b> <b>Features</b>
       Test::Modern provides a shortcut which combines several features  it  has  pilfered  from  other  testing
       modules:

       "object_ok($object, $name, %tests)"
           Runs a gamut of subtests on an object:

              object_ok(
                 $object,
                 $name,
                 isa   =&gt; \@classes,
                 does  =&gt; \@roles,
                 can   =&gt; \@methods,
                 api   =&gt; \@methods,
                 clean =&gt; $boolean,
                 more  =&gt; sub {
                    my $object = shift;
                    ...;
                 }
              );

           $object  may  be  a blessed object, or an unblessed coderef which returns a blessed object. The "isa"
           test runs "isa_ok"; the "does" test runs "does_ok", the "can" test runs "can_ok", and the "api"  test
           runs "class_api_ok".  "clean" allows you to run "namespaces_clean" on the object's class.

           "more"  introduces  a coderef for running more tests. Within this sub you can use any of the standard
           Test::More, Test::LongString, etc tests. It is automatically run in a "try"  block  (see  Try::Tiny);
           throwing an exception will cause the test to fail, but not cause the script to end.

           Any  of  the  test  hash  keys  may be omitted, in which case that test will not be run. $name may be
           omitted.

           If the test succeeds, it returns the object (which may  be  useful  for  further  tests).  Otherwise,
           returns "undef".

           Practical example:

              my $bob = object_ok(
                 sub { Employee-&gt;new(name =&gt; 'Robert Jones') },
                 '$bob',
                 isa   =&gt; [qw( Employee Person Moo::Object )],
                 does  =&gt; [qw( Employable )],
                 can   =&gt; [qw( name employee_number tax_code )],
                 clean =&gt; 1,
                 more  =&gt; sub {
                    my $object = shift;
                    is($object-&gt;name, "Robert Jones");
                    like($object-&gt;employee_number, qr/^[0-9]+$/);
                 },
              );

              # make further use of $bob
              object_ok(
                 sub { $bob-&gt;line_manager },
                 isa   =&gt; [qw( Person )],
              );

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT</b></h4><pre>
       This module uses Exporter::Tiny to perform its exports. This allows exported subs to be renamed, etc.

       The following export tags are supported:

       "-more"
           Exports the "Features from Test::More", except deprecated ones.

       "-deprecated"
           Exports the deprecated Test::More features.

       "-fatal"
           Exports the "Features from Test::Fatal".

       "-warnings"
           Exports the "Features from Test::Warnings".

       "-api"
           Exports the "Features from Test::API", including "class_api_ok".

           Exports the "Features from Test::LongString".

       "-deep"
           Exports cmp_deeply and TD.

       "-deeper"
           Exports <u>all</u> the "Features from Test::Deep".

       "-moose"
           Exports the "Features inspired by Test::Moose".

       "-clean"
           Exports the "Features inspired by Test::CleanNamespaces".

           Exports the "Features from Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage".

       "-versions"
           Exports the "Features from Test::Version".

       "-default"
           Exports  the  default  features  --  all  of the above except "-deprecated", "-pod", "-versions", and
           "-deeper". Also exports "object_ok".

       "-all"
           Exports  all  of  the  above  features  <u>including</u>  "-deprecated",  "-pod",  "-versions",   "-deeper",
           "object_ok", and "shouldnt_warn".

       "-author", "-extended", "-interactive", and "-release"
           Classify the test script.

       "-benchmark"
           The test script consists mostly of benchmarking.

       "-internet"
           The test script requires Internet access.

       "-requires", "-without"
           Specify modules required or hidden for these test cases.

       "-lib"
           Makes the absence of a "t/lib" directory fatal.

           See "Features inspired by Test::Lib".

       "-verbose"
           Makes test output more verbose. (Currently only "is_faster" takes notice of this.)

       $TODO is currently <u>always</u> exported.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Modern is affected by the following environment variables:

       "AUTHOR_TESTING", "AUTOMATED_TESTING", "EXTENDED_TESTING", "RELEASE_TESTING"
           These  variables  affect  the  behaviour  of  Test::Modern's  pod-checking  and version-checking. See
           "Features from Test::Pod and Test::Coverage" and "Features from Test::Version".

           They also can trigger certain  import  tags  to  skip  a  test  script.  See  "Features  inspired  by
           Test::DescribeMe", and "Features inspired by Test::Benchmark"

       "NO_NETWORK_TESTS"
           Automatically skips any tests which indicate that they require Internet access, without even checking
           to see if the Internet is accessible.  See "Features inspired by Test::RequiresInternet".

       "PERL_TEST_MODERN_ALLOW_WARNINGS"
           Setting this to true allows you to disable Test::Warnings' end test.

           Normally  the  end  test  will cause a test script to fail if any unexpected warnings are encountered
           during its execution. New versions of Perl, and upgrades of dependencies can cause a previously  good
           test  suite to start emitting warnings. This environment variable can be used as a "quick fix" to get
           the test suite passing again.

       Test::More,  Test::Fatal,   Test::Warnings,   Test::API,   Test::LongString,   Test::Deep,   Test::Moose,
       Test::CleanNamespaces,  Test::Requires,  Test::Without::Module, Test::RequiresInternet, Test::DescribeMe,
       Test::Lib, Test::Pod, Test::Pod::Coverage, Test::Version.
