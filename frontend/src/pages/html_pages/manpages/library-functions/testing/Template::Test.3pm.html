           use Template::Test;

           $Template::Test::DEBUG = 0;   # set this true to see each test running
           $Template::Test::EXTRA = 2;   # 2 extra tests follow test_expect()...

           ok( $true_or_false )

           # test_expect() splits $input into individual tests, processes each
           # and compares generated output against expected output
           test_expect($input, $template, \%replace );

           # $input is text or filehandle (e.g. DATA section after __END__)
           test_expect( $text );

           # $replace is a hash reference of template variables
           my $replace = {
               a =&gt; 'alpha',
               b =&gt; 'bravo'
           };
           test_expect( $input, $template, $replace );

           # ok() called after test_expect should be declared in $EXTRA (2)
           ok( $true_or_false )
           ok( $true_or_false )

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "Template::Test" module defines the <b>test_expect()</b> and other related subroutines which can be used to
       automate test scripts for the Template Toolkit.  See the numerous tests in the <u>t</u> sub-directory of the
       distribution for examples of use.

</pre><h4><b>PACKAGE</b> <b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>text_expect()</b>
       The test_expect() subroutine splits an input document into a number of separate tests, processes each one
       using the Template Toolkit and then compares the generated output against an expected output, also
       specified in the input document.  It generates the familiar "ok"/"not ok" output compatible with
       "Test::Harness".

       The test input should be specified as a text string or a reference to a filehandle (e.g. "GLOB" or
       "IO::Handle") from which it can be read.  In particular, this allows the test input to be placed after
       the "__END__" marker and read via the "DATA" filehandle.

           use Template::Test;

           test_expect(\*DATA);

           __END__
           # this is the first test (this is a comment)
           -- test --
           blah blah blah [% foo %]
           -- expect --
           blah blah blah value_of_foo

           # here's the second test (no surprise, so is this)
           -- test --
           more blah blah [% bar %]
           -- expect --
           more blah blah value_of_bar

       Blank lines between test sections are generally ignored.  Any line starting with "#" is treated as a
       comment and is ignored.

       The second and third parameters to test_expect() are optional.  The second may be either a reference to a
       Template object which should be used to process the template fragments, or a reference to a hash array
       containing configuration values which should be used to instantiate a new Template object.

           # pass reference to config hash
           my $config = {
               INCLUDE_PATH =&gt; '/here/there:/every/where',
               POST_CHOMP   =&gt; 1,
           };
           test_expect(\*DATA, $config);

           # or create Template object explicitly
           my $template = Template-&gt;new($config);
           test_expect(\*DATA, $template);

       The third parameter may be used to reference a hash array of template variable which should be defined
       when processing the tests.  This is passed to the Template <b>process()</b> method.

           my $replace = {
               a =&gt; 'alpha',
               b =&gt; 'bravo',
           };

           test_expect(\*DATA, $config, $replace);

       The second parameter may be left undefined to specify a default Template configuration.

           test_expect(\*DATA, undef, $replace);

       For testing the output of different Template configurations, a reference to a list of named Template
       objects also may be passed as the second parameter.

           my $tt1 = Template-&gt;new({ ... });
           my $tt2 = Template-&gt;new({ ... });
           my @tts = [ one =&gt; $tt1, two =&gt; $tt1 ];

       The first object in the list is used by default.  Other objects may be switched in with a '"-- use $name
       --"' marker.  This should immediately follow a '"-- test --"' line.  That object will then be used for
       the rest of the test, or until a different object is selected.

           -- test --
           -- use one --
           [% blah %]
           -- expect --
           blah, blah

           -- test --
           still using one...
           -- expect --
           ...

           -- test --
           -- use two --
           [% blah %]
           -- expect --
           blah, blah, more blah

       The test_expect() sub counts the number of tests, and then calls <b>ntests()</b> to generate the familiar
       ""1..$ntests\n"" test harness line.  Each test defined generates two test numbers.  The first indicates
       that the input was processed without error, and the second that the output matches that expected.

       Additional test may be run before test_expect() by calling <b>ok()</b>. These test results are cached until
       <b>ntests()</b> is called and the final number of tests can be calculated. Then, the ""1..$ntests"" line is
       output, along with ""ok $n"" / ""not ok $n"" lines for each of the cached test result.  Subsequent calls
       to <b>ok()</b> then generate an output line immediately.

           my $something = SomeObject-&gt;new();
           ok( $something );

           my $other = AnotherThing-&gt;new();
           ok( $other );

           test_expect(\*DATA);

       If any tests are to follow after test_expect() is called then these should be pre-declared by setting the
       $EXTRA package variable.  This value (default: 0) is added to the grand total calculated by <b>ntests()</b>.
       The results of the additional tests are also registered by calling <b>ok()</b>.

           $Template::Test::EXTRA = 2;

           # can call ok() any number of times before test_expect()
           ok( $did_that_work );
           ok( $make_sure );
           ok( $dead_certain );

           # &lt;some&gt; number of tests...
           test_expect(\*DATA, $config, $replace);

           # here's those $EXTRA tests
           ok( defined $some_result &amp;&amp; ref $some_result eq 'ARRAY' );
           ok( $some_result-&gt;[0] eq 'some expected value' );

       If you don't want to call test_expect() at all then you can call ntests($n) to declare the number of
       tests and generate the test header line.  After that, simply call <b>ok()</b> for each test passing a true or
       false values to indicate that the test passed or failed.

           <a href="../man2/ntests.2.html">ntests</a>(2);
           <a href="../man1/ok.1.html">ok</a>(1);
           <a href="../man0/ok.0.html">ok</a>(0);

       If you're really lazy, you can just call <b>ok()</b> and not bother declaring the number of tests at all.  All
       tests results will be cached until the end of the script and then printed in one go before the program
       exits.

           ok( $x );
           ok( $y );

       You can identify only a specific part of the input file for testing using the '"-- start --"' and '"--
       stop --"' markers.  Anything before the first '"-- start --"' is ignored, along with anything after the
       next '"-- stop --"' marker.

           -- test --
           this is test 1 (not performed)
           -- expect --
           this is test 1 (not performed)

           -- start --

           -- test --
           this is test 2
           -- expect --
           this is test 2

           -- stop --

           ...

   <b>ntests()</b>
       Subroutine used to specify how many tests you're expecting to run.

   <b>ok($test)</b>
       Generates an ""ok $n"" or ""not ok $n"" message if $test is true or false.

   <b>not_ok($test)</b>
       The logical inverse of <b>ok()</b>. Prints an ""ok $n"" message is $test is <u>false</u> and vice-versa.

   <b>callsign()</b>
       For historical reasons and general utility, the module also defines a callsign() subroutine which returns
       a hash mapping the letters "a" to "z" to their phonetic alphabet equivalent (e.g. radio callsigns).  This
       is used by many of the test scripts as a known source of variable values.

           test_expect(\*DATA, $config, callsign());

   <b>banner()</b>
       This subroutine prints a simple banner including any text passed as parameters.  The $DEBUG variable must
       be set for it to generate any output.

           banner('Testing something-or-other');

       example output:

           #------------------------------------------------------------
           # Testing something-or-other (27 tests completed)
           #------------------------------------------------------------

</pre><h4><b>PACKAGE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$DEBUG</b>
       The $DEBUG package variable can be set to enable debugging mode.

   <b>$PRESERVE</b>
       The $PRESERVE package variable can be set to stop the <b>test_expect()</b> from converting newlines in the
       output and expected output into the literal strings '\n'.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       This module started its butt-ugly life as the "t/texpect.pl" script.  It was cleaned up to became the
       "Template::Test" module some time around version 0.29.  It underwent further cosmetic surgery for version
       2.00 but still retains some remarkable rear-end resemblances.

       Since then the "Test::More" and related modules have appeared on CPAN making this module mostly, but not
       entirely, redundant.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>/</b> <b>KNOWN</b> <b>"FEATURES"</b></h4><pre>
       Imports all methods by default.  This is generally a Bad Thing, but this module is only used in test
       scripts (i.e. at build time) so a) we don't really care and b) it saves typing.

       The line splitter may be a bit dumb, especially if it sees lines like "-- this --" that aren't supposed
       to be special markers.  So don't do that.
