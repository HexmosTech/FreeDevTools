</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::CPAN::Meta - Validate your CPAN META.yml files.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       There are two forms this module can be used.

       The first is a standalone test of your distribution's META.yml file:

         use Test::More;
         eval "use Test::CPAN::Meta";
         plan skip_all =&gt; "Test::CPAN::Meta required for testing META.yml" if $@;
         meta_yaml_ok();

       Note that you may provide an optional label/comment/message/etc to the function, or one will be created
       automatically.

       The second form allows you to test other META.yml files, or specify a specific version you wish to test
       against:

         use Test::More tests =&gt; 6;
         use Test::CPAN::Meta;

         # specify a file and specification version
         meta_spec_ok('META.yml','1.3',$msg);

         # specify the specification version to validate the local META.yml
         meta_spec_ok(undef,'1.3',$msg);

         # specify a file, where the specification version is deduced
         # from the file itself
         meta_spec_ok('META.yml',undef,$msg);

       Note that this form requires you to specify the number of tests you will be running in your test script.
       Also note that each 'meta_spec_ok' is actually 2 tests under the hood.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This distribution was written to ensure that a META.yml file, provided with a standard distribution
       uploaded to CPAN, meets the specifications that are slowly being introduced to module uploads, via the
       use of package makers and installers such as ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Build and Module::Install.

       See CPAN::Meta for further details of the CPAN Meta Specification.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       •   meta_yaml_ok([$msg])

           Basic META.yml wrapper around meta_spec_ok.

           Returns a hash reference to the contents of the parsed META.yml

       •   meta_spec_ok($file, $version [,$msg])

           Validates  the  named  file  against  the given specification version. Both $file and $version can be
           undefined.

           Returns a hash reference to the contents of the given file, after it has been parsed.

</pre><h4><b>TESTING</b> <b>META</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       There are currently 3 distributions to test META files:

         Test-CPAN-Meta
         Test-CPAN-Meta-JSON
         Test-CPAN-Meta-YAML

       All three have slightly different requirements  and  are  intended  to  be  used  in  slightly  different
       environments.

       Test-CPAN-Meta-YAML  requires a YAML parser, and currently looks for the YAML or YAML::Syck modules. This
       is the original variant of the 3 and was intended to  provide  a  more  complete  YAML  validation  of  a
       META.yml.

       Test-CPAN-Meta  requires  the Parse::CPAN::Meta module, which is now part of Perl Core as of perl-5.10.1.
       This version is intended to be used by those only wishing to rely on core modules to test their  META.yml
       files.

       Test-CPAN-Meta-JSON  is  the  most  recent  addition  to  the  family, and is specifically aimed at those
       distributions that use a META.json Meta file. The distribution requires the JSON module to parse the Meta
       file.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS,</b> <b>PATCHES</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>FIXES</b></h4><pre>
