</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Zonemaster::Test::Basic - module implementing test for very basic domain functionality

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my @results = Zonemaster::Test::Basic-&gt;all($zone);

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       all($zone)
           Runs  between  one  and  three  tests,  depending  on the zone. If basic01 passes, basic02 is run. If
           basic02 fails, basic03 is run.

       <b>metadata()</b>
           Returns a reference to a hash, the keys of which are the names of all test methods in the module, and
           the corresponding values are references to lists with all the tags that the method  can  use  in  log
           entries.

       <b>translation()</b>
           Returns a reference to a hash with translation data. Used by the builtin translation system.

       <b>version()</b>
           Returns a version string for the module.

       can_continue(@results)
           Looks  at  the  provided  log  entries  and returns true if they indicate that further testing of the
           relevant zone is possible.

</pre><h4><b>TESTS</b></h4><pre>
       basic00
           Checks if the domain name to be tested is valid. Not all syntax tests are done here, it "just" checks
           domain name total length and labels length.  In case of failure, all other tests are aborted.

       basic01
           Checks that we can find a parent zone for the zone we're testing. If we can't, no further testing  is
           done.

       basic02
           Checks  that  the nameservers for the parent zone returns NS records for the tested zone, and that at
           least one of the nameservers thus pointed out responds sensibly to an NS query for the tested zone.

       basic03
           Checks if at least one of the nameservers pointed out by the parent zone gives a useful response when
           sent an A query for the "www" label in the tested zone (that is, if we're testing "example.org"  this
           test  will  as  for  A  records for "www.example.org"). This test is only run if the basic02 test has
           <u>failed</u>.
