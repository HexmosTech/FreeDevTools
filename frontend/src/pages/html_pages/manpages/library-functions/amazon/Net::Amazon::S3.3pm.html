</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a Perlish interface to Amazon S3. From the developer blurb: "Amazon S3 is storage
       for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon S3 provides a
       simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time,
       from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast,
       inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. The
       service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers".

       To find out more about S3, please visit: <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/">http://s3.amazonaws.com/</a>

       To use this module you will need to sign up to Amazon Web Services and provide an "Access Key ID" and "
       Secret Access Key". If you use this module, you will incurr costs as specified by Amazon. Please check
       the costs. If you use this module with your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key you must be responsible
       for these costs.

       I highly recommend reading all about S3, but in a nutshell data is stored in values. Values are
       referenced by keys, and keys are stored in buckets. Bucket names are global.

       Note: This is the legacy interface, please check out Net::Amazon::S3::Client instead.

       Development of this code happens here: https://github.com/rustyconover/net-amazon-s3

   <b>Bucket</b> <b>names</b> <b>with</b> <b>dots,</b> <b>HTTPS,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Signature</b> <b>V4</b>
       At the moment Amazon S3 doesn't play well with HTTPS and virtual bucket hosts if bucket name contains
       dots.

       Due the current implementation of Signature V4 handling you should use workaround consisting of usage of
       region hostnames

               my $bucket_region = $global_s3-&gt;bucket ($bucket)-&gt;_head_region;

               my $region_s3 = Net::Amazon:S3-&gt;new (
                       ...,
                       vendor =&gt; Net::Amazon::S3::Vendor::Amazon-&gt;new (
                               host =&gt; "s3-$bucket_region.amazonaws.com",
                               use_virtual_host =&gt; 0,
                       ),
               );

               my $bucket = $region_s3-&gt;bucket ($bucket);

       And use bucket instance / region s3 connection.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       Create a new S3 client object. Takes some arguments:

       authorization_context
           Class that provides authorization information.

           See one of available implementations for more

           Net::Amazon::S3::Authorization::Basic
           Net::Amazon::S3::Authorization::IAM
       vendor
           Instance of Net::Amazon::S3::Vendor holding vendor specific deviations.

           S3  became widely used object storage protocol with many vendors providing different feature sets and
           different compatibility level.

           One common difference is bucket's HEAD request to determine its region.

           To maintain currently known differences along with any differencies that may  rise  in  feature  it's
           better  to  hold vendor specification in dedicated classes. This also allows users to build their own
           fine-tuned vendor classes.

           Net::Amazon::S3::Vendor::Amazon
           Net::Amazon::S3::Vendor::Generic
       aws_access_key_id
           Deprecated.

           When used it's used to create authorization context.

           Use your Access Key ID as the value of the AWSAccessKeyId parameter in requests you  send  to  Amazon
           Web  Services  (when  required).  Your  Access Key ID identifies you as the party responsible for the
           request.

       aws_secret_access_key
           Deprecated.

           When used it's used to create authorization context.

           Since your Access Key ID is not encrypted in requests to AWS, it could  be  discovered  and  used  by
           anyone.  Services  that  are  not  free  require  you  to  provide  additional information, a request
           signature, to verify that a request containing your unique Access Key ID could only  have  come  from
           you.

           DO NOT INCLUDE THIS IN SCRIPTS OR APPLICATIONS YOU DISTRIBUTE. YOU'LL BE SORRY

       aws_session_token
           Deprecated.

           When used it's used to create authorization context.

           If  you  are  using  temporary  credentials provided by the AWS Security Token Service, set the token
           here, and it will be added to the request in order to authenticate it.

       use_iam_role
           Deprecated.

           When used it's used to create authorization context.

           If you'd like to use IAM provided temporary credentials, pass this option with a true value.

       secure
           Deprecated.

           Set this to 0 if you don't want to use SSL-encrypted connections when talking to S3. Defaults to 1.

           To use SSL-encrypted connections, LWP::Protocol::https is required.

           See #vendor and Net::Amazon::S3::Vendor.

       keep_alive_cache_size
           Set this to 0 to disable Keep-Alives.  Default is 10.

       timeout
           How many seconds should your script wait before bailing on a request to S3? Defaults to 30.

       retry
           If this library should retry upon errors. This option is recommended.  This uses exponential  backoff
           with retries after 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 seconds, as recommended by Amazon. Defaults to off.

           When retry is on, request will be automatically retried when one of following HTTP statuses happens

           408 - Request Timeout
           500 - Internal Server Error
           502 - Bad Gateway
           503 - Service Unavailable
           504 - Gateway Timeout

           For more details see LWP::UserAgent::Determined.

       host
           Deprecated.

           The  S3  host  endpoint  to  use.  Defaults  to 's3.amazonaws.com'. This allows you to connect to any
           S3-compatible host.

           See #vendor and Net::Amazon::S3::Vendor.

       use_virtual_host
           Deprecated.

           Use the virtual host method ('bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com') instead of specifying the bucket  at  the
           first  part of the path. This is particularly useful if you want to access buckets not located in the
           US-Standard    region    (such    as    EU,    Asia    Pacific    or     South     America).      See
           &lt;<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html</a>&gt; for the pros and cons.

           See #vendor and Net::Amazon::S3::Vendor.

       authorization_method
           Deprecated.

           Authorization implementation package name.

           This library provides Net::Amazon::S3::Signature::V2 and Net::Amazon::S3::Signature::V4

           Default is Signature 4 if host is "s3.amazonaws.com", Signature 2 otherwise

           See #vendor and Net::Amazon::S3::Vendor.

       error_handler_class
           Error handler class name (package name), see Net::Amazon::S3::Error::Handler for more.

           Default: Net::Amazon::S3::Error::Handler::Legacy

       error_handler
           Instance of error handler class.

       <u>Notes</u>

       When  using  Net::Amazon::S3  in  child  processes  using fork (such as in combination with the excellent
       Parallel::ForkManager) you should create the S3 object in each child, use a fresh LWP::UserAgent in  each
       child, or disable the LWP::ConnCache in the parent:

           $s3-&gt;ua( LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new(
               keep_alive =&gt; 0, requests_redirectable =&gt; [qw'GET HEAD DELETE PUT POST'] );

   <b>buckets</b>
       Returns undef on error, else hashref of results

   <b>add_bucket</b>
               # Create new bucket with default location
               my $bucket = $s3-&gt;add_bucket ('new-bucket');

               # Create new bucket in another location
               my $bucket = $s3-&gt;add_bucket ('new-bucket', location_constraint =&gt; 'eu-west-1');
               my $bucket = $s3-&gt;add_bucket ('new-bucket', { location_constraint =&gt; 'eu-west-1' });
               my $bucket = $s3-&gt;add_bucket (bucket =&gt; 'new-bucket', location_constraint =&gt; 'eu-west-1');
               my $bucket = $s3-&gt;add_bucket ({ bucket =&gt; 'new-bucket', location_constraint =&gt; 'eu-west-1' });

       Method creates and returns new bucket.

       In case of error it reports it and returns "undef" (refer "ERROR HANDLING").

       Recognized positional arguments (refer "CALLING CONVENTION")

       bucket
           Required, recognized as positional.

           The name of the bucket you want to add.

       Recognized optional arguments

       acl
                   acl =&gt; 'private'
                   acl =&gt; Net::Amazon::S3::ACL::Canned-&gt;PRIVATE
                   acl =&gt; Net::Amazon::S3::ACL::Set-&gt;grant_read (email =&gt; '<a href="mailto:foo@bar.baz">foo@bar.baz</a>')

           <u>Available</u> <u>since</u> <u>v0.94</u>

           Set ACL to the newly created bucket. Refer Net::Amazon::S3::ACL for possibilities.

       acl_short (deprecated)
           <u>Deprecated</u> <u>since</u> <u>v0.94</u>

           When specified its value is used to populate "acl" argument (unless it exists).

       location_constraint
           Optional.

           Sets  the  location  constraint  of  the  new  bucket. If left unspecified, the default S3 datacenter
           location will be used.

           This library recognizes regions according Amazon S3 documentation

           →   &lt;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html#API_CreateBucket_RequestSyntax&gt;

       Provides operation CreateBucket &lt;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html&gt;.

   <b>bucket</b> <b>BUCKET</b>
               # build bucket with guessed region
               $s3-&gt;bucket ('foo');
               $s3-&gt;bucket (bucket =&gt; 'foo');
               $s3-&gt;bucket (name   =&gt; 'foo');

               # build with explicit region
               $s3-&gt;bucket ('foo', region =&gt; 'bar');

       Returns an (unverified) bucket object from an account. Does no network access.

       However, when guessing region, "HeadRegion" operation may be called before first network access.

       Region is mandatory when using Signature V4 authorization, which is default for AWS. AWS limits number of
       HTTP                                            requests,                                             see
       &lt;https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-request-limit-avoid-throttling/&gt;

   <b>delete_bucket</b>
               $s3-&gt;delete_bucket ($bucket);
               $s3-&gt;delete_bucket (bucket =&gt; $bucket);

       Deletes bucket from account.

       Returns "true" if the bucket is successfully deleted.

       Returns "false" and reports an error otherwise (refer "ERROR HANDLING")

       Positional arguments (refer "CALLING CONVENTION")

       bucket
           Required.

           The name of the bucket or Net::Amazon::S3::Bucket instance you want to delete.

       Provides operation "DeleteBucket" &lt;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucket.html&gt;

   <b>list_bucket</b>
       List all keys in this bucket.

       Takes a hashref of arguments:

       MANDATORY

       bucket
           The name of the bucket you want to list keys on

       OPTIONAL

       prefix
           Restricts the response to only contain results that begin with the specified prefix. If you omit this
           optional  argument,  the value of prefix for your query will be the empty string. In other words, the
           results will be not be restricted by prefix.

       delimiter
           If this optional, Unicode string parameter is included with your request, then keys that contain  the
           same  string  between  the  prefix and the first occurrence of the delimiter will be rolled up into a
           single result element in the  CommonPrefixes  collection.  These  rolled-up  keys  are  not  returned
           elsewhere  in  the  response.   For  example, with prefix="USA/" and delimiter="/", the matching keys
           "USA/Oregon/Salem" and "USA/Oregon/Portland"  would  be  summarized  in  the  response  as  a  single
           "USA/Oregon"  element in the CommonPrefixes collection. If an otherwise matching key does not contain
           the delimiter after the prefix, it appears in the Contents collection.

           Each element in the CommonPrefixes collection counts as one against the MaxKeys limit. The  rolled-up
           keys represented by each CommonPrefixes element do not.  If the Delimiter parameter is not present in
           your  request, keys in the result set will not be rolled-up and neither the CommonPrefixes collection
           nor the NextMarker element will be present in the response.

       max-keys
           This optional argument limits the number of results returned in response to  your  query.  Amazon  S3
           will  return  no  more  than  this  number  of  results,  but  possibly less. Even if max-keys is not
           specified, Amazon S3 will limit the number of results in the response.  Check the IsTruncated flag to
           see if your results are incomplete.  If so, use the Marker parameter to  request  the  next  page  of
           results.   For  the  purpose  of  counting  max-keys,  a  'result'  is either a key in the 'Contents'
           collection, or a delimited prefix in the 'CommonPrefixes' collection. So for delimiter requests, max-
           keys limits the total number of list results, not just the number of keys.

       marker
           This optional parameter enables pagination of large result sets.  "marker"  specifies  where  in  the
           result  set  to  resume  listing.  It  restricts  the  response  to  only  contain results that occur
           alphabetically after the value of marker. To retrieve the next page of results, use the last key from
           the current page of results as the marker in your next request.

           See also "next_marker", below.

           If "marker" is omitted,the first page of results is returned.

       Returns undef on error and a hashref of data on success:

       The hashref looks like this:

         {
               bucket          =&gt; $bucket_name,
               prefix          =&gt; $bucket_prefix,
               common_prefixes =&gt; [$prefix1,$prefix2,...]
               marker          =&gt; $bucket_marker,
               next_marker     =&gt; $bucket_next_available_marker,
               max_keys        =&gt; $bucket_max_keys,
               is_truncated    =&gt; $bucket_is_truncated_boolean
               keys            =&gt; [$key1,$key2,...]
          }

       Explanation of bits of that:

       common_prefixes
           If list_bucket was requested with a delimiter,  common_prefixes  will  contain  a  list  of  prefixes
           matching  that  delimiter.   Drill down into these prefixes by making another request with the prefix
           parameter.

       is_truncated
           B flag that indicates whether or not all results of your query were returned  in  this  response.  If
           your results were truncated, you can make a follow-up paginated request using the Marker parameter to
           retrieve the rest of the results.

       next_marker
           A  convenience  element,  useful  when  paginating  with  delimiters.  The value of "next_marker", if
           present, is the largest (alphabetically) of all key names and  all  CommonPrefixes  prefixes  in  the
           response.  If the "is_truncated" flag is set, request the next page of results by setting "marker" to
           the value of "next_marker". This element is only present in the response if the "delimiter" parameter
           was sent with the request.

       Each key is a hashref that looks like this:

            {
               key           =&gt; $key,
               last_modified =&gt; $last_mod_date,
               etag          =&gt; $etag, # An MD5 sum of the stored content.
               size          =&gt; $size, # Bytes
               storage_class =&gt; $storage_class # Doc?
               owner_id      =&gt; $owner_id,
               owner_displayname =&gt; $owner_name
           }

   <b>list_bucket_all</b>
       List  all  keys  in this bucket without having to worry about 'marker'. This is a convenience method, but
       may make multiple requests to S3 under the hood.

       Takes the same arguments as list_bucket.

   <b>_perform_operation</b>
           my $response = $s3-&gt;_perform_operation ('Operation' =&gt; (
               # ... operation request parameters
           ));

       Internal operation implementation method, takes request construction parameters, performs necessary  HTTP
       requests(s) and returns Response instance.

       Method takes same named parameters as realted Request class.

       Method provides available contextual parameters by default (eg s3, bucket)

       Method invokes contextual error handler.

</pre><h4><b>CALLING</b> <b>CONVENTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Available</u> <u>since</u> <u>v0.97</u> - calling convention extentend

       In  order  to  make  method  calls somehow consistent, backward compatible, and extendable, API's methods
       support multiple ways how to provide their arguments

       plain named arguments (preferred)
                   method (named =&gt; 'argument', another =&gt; 'argument');

       trailing configuration hash
                   method ({ named =&gt; 'argument', another =&gt; 'argument' });
                   method (positional, { named =&gt; 'argument', another =&gt; 'argument' } );

           Last argument of every method can be configuration hash, treated as additional named  arguments.  Can
           be combined with named arguments.

       positional arguments with optional named arguments
                   method (positional, named =&gt; 'argument', another =&gt; 'argument');
                   method (positional, { named =&gt; 'argument', another =&gt; 'argument' } );

           For methods supporting mandatory positional arguments additional named arguments and/or configuration
           hash is supported.

           Named  arguments  or configuration hash can specify value of positional arguments as well removing it
           from list of required positional arguments for given call (see example)

                   $s3-&gt;bucket-&gt;add_key ('key', 'value', acl =&gt; $acl);
                   $s3-&gt;bucket-&gt;add_key ('value', key =&gt; 'key', acl =&gt; $acl);
                   $s3-&gt;bucket-&gt;add_key (key =&gt; 'key', value =&gt; 'value', acl =&gt; $acl);

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Amazon::S3 supports pluggable error handling via Net::Amazon::S3::Error::Handler.

       When response ends up with an error, every method reports it, and in case it receives  control  back  (no
       exception), it returns "undef".

       Default error handling for Net::Amazon::S3 is Net::Amazon::S3::Error::Handler::Legacy which (mostly) sets
       "err" and "errstr".

</pre><h4><b>TESTING</b></h4><pre>
       Testing  S3 is a tricky thing. Amazon wants to charge you a bit of money each time you use their service.
       And yes, testing counts as  using.   Because  of  this,  the  application's  test  suite  skips  anything
       approaching a real test unless you set these three environment variables:

       AMAZON_S3_EXPENSIVE_TESTS
           Doesn't matter what you set it to. Just has to be set

       AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
           Your AWS access key

       AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET
           Your  AWS  sekkr1t  passkey.  Be forewarned that setting this environment variable on a shared system
           might leak that information to another user. Be careful.
