</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dpkg::Changelog - base class to implement a changelog parser

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Dpkg::Changelog is a class representing a changelog file as an array of changelog entries
       (Dpkg::Changelog::Entry).  By deriving this class and implementing its <b>parse()</b> method, you add the
       ability to fill this object with changelog entries.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $c = Dpkg::Changelog-&gt;new(%opts)
           Creates a new changelog object.

           Accepts the same options as $c-&gt;<b>set_options()</b>.

       $c-&gt;set_options(%opts)
           Change the value of some options.

           Options:

           <b>verbose</b>
               Defines whether parse errors are displayed as warnings by default.

               Defaults to 1.

           <b>reportfile</b>
               A string to use instead of the name of the file parsed, in particular in error messages.

           <b>range</b>
               Defines the range of entries that we want to parse, the parser will stop as soon as it has parsed
               enough data to satisfy $c-&gt;get_range($opts{range}).

       $count = $c-&gt;parse($fh, $description)
           Read  the  filehandle and parse a changelog in it. The data in the object is reset before parsing new
           data.

           Returns the number of changelog entries that have been parsed with success.

           This method needs to be implemented by one of the specialized changelog format subclasses.

       $count = $c-&gt;load($filename)
           Parse $filename contents for a changelog.

           Returns the number of changelog entries that have been parsed with success.

       $c-&gt;<b>reset_parse_errors()</b>
           Can be used to delete all information about errors occurred during previous <b>parse()</b> runs.

       $c-&gt;parse_error($file, $line_nr, $error, [$line])
           Record a new parse error in $file at line $line_nr. The error message is specified with $error and  a
           copy of the line can be recorded in $line.

       $c-&gt;<b>get_parse_errors()</b>
           Returns  all  error  messages from the last <b>parse()</b> run.  If called in scalar context returns a human
           readable string representation. If called in list context returns an array of arrays. Each  of  these
           arrays contains

           1.  a  string describing the origin of the data (a filename usually). If the reportfile configuration
               option was given, its value will be used instead.

           2.  the line number where the error occurred

           3.  an error description

           4.  the original line

       $c-&gt;set_unparsed_tail($tail)
           Add a string representing unparsed lines after the changelog entries.  Use undef as $tail  to  remove
           the unparsed lines currently set.

       $c-&gt;<b>get_unparsed_tail()</b>
           Return a string representing the unparsed lines after the changelog entries. Returns undef if there's
           no such thing.

       @{$c}
           Returns all the Dpkg::Changelog::Entry objects contained in this changelog in the order in which they
           have been parsed.

       $c-&gt;get_range($range)
           Returns  an  array  (if  called in list context) or a reference to an array of Dpkg::Changelog::Entry
           objects which each represent one entry of the changelog. $range is a hash  reference  describing  the
           range of entries to return. See section "RANGE SELECTION".

       $c-&gt;<b>abort_early()</b>
           Returns  true  if enough data have been parsed to be able to return all entries selected by the range
           set at creation (or with set_options).

       $str = $c-&gt;<b>output()</b>
       "$c"
           Returns a string representation of the changelog (it's a concatenation of the  string  representation
           of the individual changelog entries).

       $c-&gt;output($fh)
           Output the changelog to the given filehandle.

       $c-&gt;save($filename)
           Save the changelog in the given file.

       $control = $c-&gt;format_range($format, $range)
           Formats  the changelog into Dpkg::Control::Changelog objects representing the entries selected by the
           optional range specifier (see "RANGE SELECTION" for details). In scalar context returns a Dpkg::Index
           object containing the selected entries, in list context returns an array of  Dpkg::Control::Changelog
           objects.

           With  format  <b>dpkg</b>  the returned Dpkg::Control::Changelog object is coalesced from the entries in the
           changelog that are part of the range requested, with the fields described below, but considering that
           "selected entry" means the first entry of the selected range.

           With format <b>rfc822</b> each  returned  Dpkg::Control::Changelog  objects  represents  one  entry  in  the
           changelog  that is part of the range requested, with the fields described below, but considering that
           "selected entry" means for each entry.

           The different formats return undef if no entries are matched. The following fields are  contained  in
           the object(s) returned:

           Source
               package name (selected entry)

           Version
               packages' version (selected entry)

           Distribution
               target distribution (selected entry)

           Urgency
               urgency (highest of all entries in range)

           Maintainer
               person that created the (selected) entry

           Date
               date of the (selected) entry

           Timestamp
               date of the (selected) entry as a timestamp in seconds since the epoch

           Closes
               bugs closed by the (selected) entry/entries, sorted by bug number

           Changes
               content of the (selected) entry/entries

</pre><h4><b>RANGE</b> <b>SELECTION</b></h4><pre>
       A range selection is described by a hash reference where the allowed keys and values are described below.

       The following options take a version number as value.

       since
           Causes changelog information from all versions strictly later than <b>version</b> to be used.

       until
           Causes changelog information from all versions strictly earlier than <b>version</b> to be used.

       from
           Similar to "since" but also includes the information for the specified <b>version</b> itself.

       to  Similar to "until" but also includes the information for the specified <b>version</b> itself.

       The following options don't take version numbers as values:

       all If set to a true value, all entries of the changelog are returned, this overrides all other options.

       count
           Expects  a signed integer as value. Returns "value" entries from the top of the changelog if set to a
           positive integer, and abs(value) entries from the tail if set to a negative integer.

       offset
           Expects a signed integer as value. Changes the starting point for "count", either  counted  from  the
           top  (positive integer) or from the tail (negative integer). "offset" has no effect if "count" wasn't
           given as well.

       Some examples for the above options. Imagine an example changelog with entries for the versions 1.2, 1.3,
       2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0 and 3.1.

         Range                        Included entries
         -----                        ----------------
         since =&gt; '2.0'               3.1, 3.0, 2.2
         until =&gt; '2.0'               1.3, 1.2
         from  =&gt; '2.0'               3.1, 3.0, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0
         to    =&gt; '2.0'               2.0, 1.3, 1.2
         count =&gt;  2                  3.1, 3.0
         count =&gt; -2                  1.3, 1.2
         count =&gt;  3, offset =&gt; 2     2.2, 2.1, 2.0
         count =&gt;  2, offset =&gt; -3    2.0, 1.3
         count =&gt; -2, offset =&gt; 3     3.0, 2.2
         count =&gt; -2, offset =&gt; -3    2.2, 2.1

       Any combination of one option of "since" and "from" and one of "until" and "to" returns the  intersection
       of the two results with only one of the options specified.
