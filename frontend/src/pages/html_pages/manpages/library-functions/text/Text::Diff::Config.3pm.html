</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Text::Diff::Config - global configuration for Text::Diff (as a separate module).

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Text::Diff::Config;

         $Text::Diff::Config::Output_Unicode = 1;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module configures Text::Diff and its related modules. Currently it contains only one global variable
       $Text::Diff::Config::Output_Unicode  which is a boolean flag, that if set outputs unicode characters as
       themselves without escaping them as " \x{HHHH} " first.

       It is initialized to the value of  $ENV{DIFF_OUTPUT_UNICODE} , but can be set to a different value at
       run-time, including using local.
