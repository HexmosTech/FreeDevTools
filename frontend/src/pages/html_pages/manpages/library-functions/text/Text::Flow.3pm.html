</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Text::Flow - Flexible text flowing and word wrapping for not just ASCII output.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Text::Flow;

         # use it on ASCII text ...
         my $flow = Text::Flow-&gt;new(
             check_height =&gt; sub {
                 my $paras = shift;
                 sum(map { scalar @$_ } @$paras) &lt;= 10;
             },
             wrapper =&gt; Text::Flow::Wrap-&gt;new(
                 check_width  =&gt; sub { length($_[0]) &lt; 70 }
             ),
         );

         my @sections = $flow-&gt;flow($text);

         # @sections will now be an array of strings, each string
         # will contain no more than 10 lines of text each of which
         # will be no longer then 70 characters long

         # or use it on text in a PDF file ...
         my $flow = Text::Flow-&gt;new(
             check_height =&gt; sub {
                 my $paras = shift;
                 (sum(map { scalar @$_ } @$paras) * $pdf-&gt;get_font_height) &lt; 200;
             },
             wrapper =&gt; Text::Flow::Wrap-&gt;new(
                 check_width =&gt; sub {
                     my $string = shift;
                     $pdf-&gt;get_string_width($string) &lt; 100
                 },
             )
         );

         my @sections = $flow-&gt;flow($text);

         # @sections will now be an array of strings, each string
         # will contain text which will fit within 200 pts and
         # each line will be no longer then 100 pts wide

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a flexible way to wrap and flow text for both ASCII and non-ASCII outputs.

   <b>Another</b> <b>Text</b> <b>Wrap</b> <b>module!!?!?!</b>
       The main purpose of this module is to provide text wrapping and flowing features without being tied down
       to ASCII based output and fixed-width fonts. My needs were for a more sophisticated text control in PDF
       and GIF output formats in particular.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>new</b> <b>(%params)</b>
           This  constructs  the  new  Text::Flow  instance,  and  accepts  parameters  for  the  "wrapper"  and
           "check_height" variables.

       <b>wrapper</b> <b>(?$wrapper)</b>
           This is the accessor for the internally help Text::Flow::Wrapper instance which is used by Text::Flow
           to wrap the individual lines.

       <b>check_height</b>
           This is the accessor for the CODE ref which is used to check the height of the current paragraph.  It
           gets  as  an  argument, an array-ref of paragraphs, each of which is also an array-ref of text lines.
           The most common usage is shown in the SYNOPSIS above, but you can really do anything  you  want  with
           them.  It  is  expected to return a Boolean value, true if the height is still okay, and false if the
           max height has been reached.

       <b>flow</b> <b>($text)</b>
           This method preforms the text flowing. It returns an  array  of  strings  which  can  be  treated  as
           complete blocks of text. It will handle paragraph breaks and line breaks for you.

   <b>Introspection</b>
       <b>meta</b>
           Returns the Moose meta object associated with this class.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       I wanted to write some tests for using this with GD modules as well. I suppose we will have to wait until
       0.02 for that.

</pre><h4><b>SIMILAR</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       There are a bunch of other text wrapping and flowing modules out there, but they are all meant for use in
       ASCII  outout  only.  This  just didn't work for my needs, so I wrote this one. If you need to wrap ASCII
       text and want to do it in a much simpler manner then this module provides, then I  suggest  checking  out
       those  modules.  This module is specifically made for when those other modules are no longer powerful and
       flexible enough.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no exception. If you find  a  bug  please
       either email me, or add the bug to cpan-RT.
