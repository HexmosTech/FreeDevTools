           Returns the number of words in the analysed text file or block. A word must
           consist of letters a-z with at least one vowel sound, and optionally an
           apostrophe or hyphen.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIRES</b></h4><pre>
       Lingua::EN::Syllable, Lingua::EN::Sentence

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module analyses English text in either a string or file. Totals are then calculated for the number
       of characters, words, sentences, blank and non blank (text) lines and paragraphs.

       Three common readability statistics are also derived, the Fog, Flesch and Kincaid indices.

       All of these properties can be accessed through individual methods, or by generating a text report.

       A hash of all unique words and the number of times they occur is generated.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       The "new" method creates an instance of an text object This must be called before any of the following
       methods are invoked. Note that the object only needs to be created once, and can be reused with new input
       data.

          my $text = Lingua::EN::Fathom-&gt;new();

   <b>analyse_file</b>
       The "analyse_file" method takes as input the name of a text file. Various text based statistics are
       calculated for the file. This method and "analyse_block" are prerequisites for all the following methods.
       An optional argument may be supplied to control accumulation of statistics. If set to a non zero value,
       all statistics are accumulated with each successive call.

           $text-&gt;analyse_file("sample.txt");

   <b>analyse_block</b>
       The "analyse_block" method takes as input a text string. Various text based statistics are calculated for
       the file. This method and "analyse_file" are prerequisites for all the following methods. An optional
       argument may be supplied to control accumulation of statistics. If set to a non zero value, all
       statistics are accumulated with each successive call.

           $text-&gt;analyse_block($text_str,$accumulate);

   <b>num_chars</b>
       Returns the number of characters in the analysed text file or block. This includes characters such as
       spaces, and punctuation marks.

   <b>num_words</b>
       Returns the number of words in the analysed text file or block. A word must consist of letters a-z with
       at least one vowel sound, and optionally an apostrophe or hyphen. Items such as "&amp;, K108, NW" are not
       counted as words.

   <b>percent_complex_words</b>
       Returns the percentage of complex words in the analysed text file or block. A complex word must consist
       of three or more syllables. This statistic is used to calculate the fog index.

   <b>num_sentences</b>
       Returns the number of sentences in the analysed text file or block. A sentence is any group of words and
       non words terminated with a single full stop. Spaces may occur before and after the full stop.

   <b>num_text_lines</b>
       Returns the number of lines containing some text in the analysed text file or block.

   <b>num_non_text_lines</b>
       Returns the number of lines containing no text in the analysed text file or block.

   <b>num_blank_lines</b>
       Returns the number of empty lines in the analysed text file or block.

   <b>num_paragraphs</b>
       Returns the number of paragraphs in the analysed text file or block.

   <b>syllables_per_word</b>
       Returns the average number of syllables per word in the analysed text file or block.

   <b>words_per_sentence</b>
       Returns the average number of words per sentence in the analysed text file or block.

   <b>READABILITY</b>
       Three indices of text readability are calculated. They all measure complexity as a function of syllables
       per word and words per sentence. They assume the text is well formed and logical. You could analyse a
       passage of nonsensical English and find the readability is quite good, provided the words are not too
       complex and the sentences not too long.

       For more information see: &lt;<a href="http://www.plainlanguage.com/Resources/readability.html">http://www.plainlanguage.com/Resources/readability.html</a>&gt;

   <b>fog</b>
       Returns the Fog index for the analysed text file or block.

         ( words_per_sentence + percent_complex_words ) * 0.4

       The Fog index, developed by Robert Gunning, is a well known and simple formula for measuring readability.
       The index indicates the number of years of formal education a reader of average intelligence would need
       to read the text once and understand that piece of writing with its word sentence workload.

          18 unreadable
          14 difficult
          12 ideal
          10 acceptable
           8 childish

   <b>flesch</b>
       Returns the Flesch reading ease score for the analysed text file or block.

          206.835 - (1.015 * words_per_sentence) - (84.6 * syllables_per_word)

       This score rates text on a 100 point scale. The higher the score, the easier it is to understand the
       text. A score of 60 to 70 is considered to be optimal.

   <b>kincaid</b>
       Returns the Flesch-Kincaid grade level score for the analysed text file or block.

          (11.8 * syllables_per_word) +  (0.39 * words_per_sentence) - 15.59;

       This score rates text on U.S. grade school level. So a score of 8.0 means that the document can be
       understood by an eighth grader. A score of 7.0 to 8.0 is considered to be optimal.

   <b>unique_words</b>
       Returns a hash of unique words. The words (in lower case) are held in the hash keys while the number of
       occurrences are held in the hash values.

   <b>report</b>
           print($text-&gt;report);

       Produces a text based report containing all Fathom statistics for the currently analysed text block or
       file. For example:

       Number of characters       : 813 Number of words            : 135 Percent of complex words   : 20.00
       Average syllables per word : 1.7704 Number of sentences        : 12 Average words per sentence : 11.2500
       Number of text lines       : 13 Number of non text lines   : 0 Number of blank lines      : 8 Number of
       paragraphs       : 4

       READABILITY INDICES

       Fog                        : 12.5000 Flesch                     : 45.6429 Flesch-Kincaid             :
       9.6879

       The return value is a string containing the report contents

</pre><h4><b>POSSIBLE</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Count white space and punctuation characters Allow user control over what strictly defines a word

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The syllable count provided in Lingua::EN::Syllable is about 90% accurate Acronyms that contain vowels,
       like GPO, will be counted as words.  The fog index should exclude proper names
