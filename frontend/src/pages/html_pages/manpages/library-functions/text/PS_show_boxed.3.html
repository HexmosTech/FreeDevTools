</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PS_show_boxed — Output text in a box

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;pslib.h&gt;

       int  PS_show_boxed(PSDoc  *psdoc,  char *text, float left, float bottom, float width, float height, const
       char *hmode, const char *feature)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Outputs a text in a given box. The lower left corner of the box is at (<b>left</b>, <b>bottom</b>).  If the  <b>height</b>  is
       set  to  0.0 the box will become as tall as needed to contain all the text. If <b>feature</b> is set to <b>blind</b> no
       text will be output but the is set as usual. This can for example be used to  calculate  the  box  height
       needed to comprise all text or in order to determine how much text fits into a box.

       Line  breaks will be inserted where needed. Multiple spaces are treated as one. Tabulators are treated as
       spaces. The parameter <b>hmode</b> can be "justify", "fulljustify", "right", "left", or "center". The difference
       of "justify" and "fulljustify" just affects the last line of the box. In fulljustify mode the  last  line
       will  be left and right justified unless this is also the last line of paragraph. In justify mode it will
       always be left justified.

       The text will be  hyphenated  if  the  parameter  "hyphenation"  is  set  to  "true"  and  the  parameter
       "hyphendict"  contains  a valid filename for a hyphenation file. The line spacing is taken from the value
       "leading". Paragraphs can be separated by an empty line just like in TeX. If the value "parindent" is set
       to value &gt; 0.0 then the first n lines will be indented. The number  of  indented  lines  is  set  by  the
       parameter  "numindentlines".  In  order  to  prevent  indenting  of  the first m paragraphs set the value
       "parindentskip" to a positive number.

</pre><h4><b>USED</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The output of <b>PS_show_boxed</b> can be configured with several parameters and values which must be  set  with
       either  <b><a href="../man3/PS_set_parameter.3.html">PS_set_parameter</a>(3)</b> or <b><a href="../man3/PS_set_value.3.html">PS_set_value</a>(3)</b>. Beside the parameters and values which affect text output
       the following parameters and values are evaluated.

       leading (value)
                 Distance between baselines of two consecutive lines.

       linebreak (parameter)
                 Set to "true" if you want a carrige return to start a new line instead  of  treating  it  as  a
                 space. Defaults to "false".

       parbreak (parameter)
                 Set to "true" if you want a carrige return on a single line to start a new paragraph instead of
                 treating it as a space.  Defaults to "true".

       hyphenation (parameter)
                 Set  to  "true"  in order to turn hyphenation on. This requires a dictionary to be set with the
                 parameter "hyphendict". Defaults to "false".

       hyphendict (parameter)
                 Filename of the dictionary used for hyphenation pattern (see below).

       hyphenminchar (value)
                 The number of chars which must at least be left over before or after the hyphen.  This  implies
                 that  only  words  of  at  least  two times this value will be hyphenated. The default value is
                 three. Setting a value of zero will result in the default value.

       parindent (value)
                 Set the amount of space in pixel for indenting the first m lines of a paragraph. m can  be  set
                 with the value "numindentlines".

       parskip (value)
                 Set  the amount of extra space in pixel between paragraphs.  Defaults to 0 which will result in
                 a normal line distance.

       numindentlines (value)
                 Number of lines from the start of the paragraph which will be indented. Defaults to 1.

       parindentskip (value)
                 Number of paragraphs in the box whose first lines will not be indented.  This  defaults  to  0.
                 This is useful for paragraphs right after a section heading or text being continued in a second
                 box. In both case one would set this to 1.

       linenumbermode (parameter)
                 Set  how  lines  are to be numbered. Possible values are "box" for numbering lines in the whole
                 box or "paragraph" to number lines within each paragraph.

       linenumberspace (value)
                 The space for the column left of the numbered line containing the line number. The line  number
                 will be right justified into this column. Defaults to 20.

       linenumbersep (value)
                 The space between the column with line numbers and the line itself. Defaults to 5.

</pre><h4><b>HYPHENATION</b></h4><pre>
       Text  is hyphenated if the parameter "hyphenation" is set to true and a valid hyphenation dictory is set.
       pslib does not ship its own hyphenation dictionary but uses one from openoffice, scribus or koffice.  You
       can find their dictionaries for different languages in one of the following directories if  the  software
       is        installed:        /usr/share/apps/koffice/hyphdicts/,        /usr/lib/scribus/dicts/,        or
       /usr/lib/openoffice/share/dict/ooo/.  Currently scribus appears to have  the  most  complete  hyphenation
       dictionaries.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Number  of  charactes that could not be written. This function will also set the value "boxheight" to the
       actual height of the box. This enables you to put several boxed beneath each other and keep  the  propper
       line spacing.
