</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Text::MicroMason::HTMLMason - Simple Compiler for Mason-style Templating

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Create a MicroMason object to interpret the templates:

         use Text::MicroMason;
         my $mason = Text::MicroMason-&gt;new();

       Use the standard compile and execute methods to parse and evaluate templates:

         print $mason-&gt;compile( text=&gt;$template )-&gt;( @%args );
         print $mason-&gt;execute( text=&gt;$template, @args );

       Mason syntax provides several ways to mix Perl into a text template:

         &lt;%args&gt;
           $name
         &lt;/%args&gt;

         % if ( $name eq 'Dave' ) {
           I'm sorry &lt;% $name %&gt;, I'm afraid I can't do that right now.
         % } else {
           &lt;%perl&gt;
             my $hour = (localtime)[2];
             my $daypart = ( $hour &gt; 11 ) ? 'afternoon' : 'morning';
           &lt;/%perl&gt;
           Good &lt;% $daypart %&gt;, &lt;% $name %&gt;!
         % }

         &lt;&amp; "includes/standard_footer.msn" &amp;&gt;

         &lt;%doc&gt;
           Here's a private developr comment describing this template.
         &lt;/%doc&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Text::MicroMason::HTMLMason class provides lexer and assembler methods that allow Text::MicroMason to
       handle most elements of HTML::Mason's template syntax.

   <b>Compatibility</b> <b>with</b> <b>HTML::Mason</b>
       HTML::Mason is a full-featured application server toolkit with many fatures, of which only the templating
       functionality is emulated.

       The following sets of HTML::Mason features <b>are</b> supported by Text::MicroMason:

       •   Template interpolation with &lt;% expr %&gt;

       •   Literal Perl lines with leading %

       •   Named %args, %perl, %once, %init, %cleanup, and %doc blocks

       •   The $m mason object, although with many fewer methods

       •   Expression filtering with |h and |u (via -Filter mixin)

       The following sets of HTML::Mason features are <b>not</b> supported by Text::MicroMason:

       •   No %attr, %flag, %shared, %method, or %def blocks.

       •   No shared files like autohandler and dhandler.

       •   No $r request object. No mod_perl integration or configuration capability.

       Contributed  patches  to  add  these  features  of  HTML::Mason would be welcomed by the author. Possible
       implementations are described in Text::MicroMason::ToDo.

   <b>Private</b> <b>Methods</b>
       The following internal methods are used to implement the syntax described below.

       lex_token
             ( $type, $value ) = $mason-&gt;lex_token();

           Supports HTML::Mason's markup syntax.

           Attempts to parse a token from the template text stored in the global $_ and returns a token type and
           value. Returns an empty list if unable to parse further due to an error.

       <b>assembler_rules()</b>
           Returns a hash of text elements used for Perl subroutine assembly. Used by <b>assemble()</b>.

           Supports HTML::Mason's named blocks of Perl code and documentation: %once, %init, %cleanup, and %doc.

       assemble_args
           Called by <b>assemble()</b>, this method provides support for Mason's &lt;%args&gt; blocks.

</pre><h4><b>TEMPLATE</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       Here's an example of Mason-style templating, taken from HTML::Mason:

           % my $noun = 'World';
           Hello &lt;% $noun %&gt;!
           How are ya?

       Interpreting this template with Text::MicroMason produces the same output as it would in HTML::Mason:

           Hello World!
           How are ya?

       Text::MicroMason::HTMLMason supports a syntax that is mostly a subset of that used by HTML::Mason.

   <b>Template</b> <b>Markup</b>
       The following types of markup are recognized in template pages:

       •   <u>literal_text</u>

           Anything not specifically parsed by one of the below rules is interpreted as literal text.

       •   &lt;% <u>perl_expr</u> %&gt;

           A Perl expression to be interpolated into the result.

           For example, the following template text will return a scheduled greeting:

               Good &lt;% (localtime)[2]&gt;11 ? 'afternoon' : 'morning' %&gt;.

           The block may span multiple lines and is scoped inside a "do" block, so it may contain multiple  Perl
           statements and it need not end with a semicolon.

               Good &lt;% my $h = (localtime)[2]; $h &gt; 11 ? 'afternoon'
                                                       : 'morning'  %&gt;.

       •   % <u>perl_code</u>

           Lines  which  begin  with the % character, without any leading whitespace, may contain arbitrary Perl
           code to be executed when encountering this portion of the template.  Their result is not interpolated
           into the result.

           For example, the following template text will return a scheduled greeting:

               % my $daypart = (localtime)[2]&gt;11 ? 'afternoon' : 'morning';
               Good &lt;% $daypart %&gt;.

           The line may contain one or more statements.  This code is is not placed in its own block  scope,  so
           it  should typically end with a semicolon; it can still open a spanning block scope closed by a later
           perl block.

           For example, the following template text will return one of two different  messages  each  time  it's
           interpreted:

               % if ( int rand 2 ) {
                 Hello World!
               % } else {
                 Goodbye Cruel World!
               % }

           This also allows you to quickly comment out sections of a template by prefacing each line with "% #".

           This is equivalent to a &lt;%perl&gt;...&lt;/%perl&gt; block.

       •   &lt;&amp; <u>template_filename</u>, <u>arguments</u> &amp;&gt;

           Includes  the  results  of  a separate file containing MicroMason code, compiling it and executing it
           with any arguments passed after the filename.

           For example, we could place the following template text into an separate file:

               Good &lt;% $ARGS{hour} &gt;11 ? 'afternoon' : 'morning' %&gt;.

           Assuming this file was named "greeting.msn", its results could  be  embedded  within  the  output  of
           another script as follows:

             &lt;&amp; "greeting.msn", hour =&gt; (localtime)[2] &amp;&gt;

       •   &lt;%<u>name</u>&gt; ... &lt;/%<u>name</u>&gt;

           A  named  block contains a span of text. The name at the start and end must match, and must be one of
           the supported block names.

           Depending on the name, performs one of the behaviors described in "Named Blocks".

   <b>Named</b> <b>Blocks</b>
       The following types of named blocks are supported:

       •   &lt;%perl&gt; <u>perl_code</u> &lt;/%perl&gt;

           Blocks surrounded by %perl tags may contain arbitrary Perl code.  Their result  is  not  interpolated
           into the result.

           These  blocks  may  span  multiple  lines  in  your  template  file.  For example, the below template
           initializes a Perl variable inside a %perl block, and then interpolates the result into a message.

               &lt;%perl&gt;
                 my $count = join '', map "$_... ", ( 1 .. 9 );
               &lt;/%perl&gt;
               Here are some numbers: &lt;% $count %&gt;

           The code may contain one or more statements.  This code is is not placed in its own block  scope,  so
           it  should typically end with a semicolon; it can still open a spanning block scope closed by a later
           perl block.

           For example, when the below template text is evaluated it will return a sequence of digits:

               Here are some numbers:
               &lt;%perl&gt;
                 foreach my $digit ( 1 .. 9 ) {
               &lt;/%perl&gt;
                   &lt;% $digit %&gt;...
               &lt;%perl&gt;
                 }
               &lt;/%perl&gt;

           If the block is immediately followed by a line break, that break is discarded.  These blocks are  not
           whitespace sensitive, so the template could be combined into a single line if desired.

       •   &lt;%args&gt; <u>variable</u> =&gt; <u>default</u> &lt;/%args&gt;

           Defines  a  collection  of variables to be initialized from named arguments passed to the subroutine.
           Arguments are separated by one or more newlines, and may optionally be followed by a  default  value.
           If  no default value is provided, the argument is required and the subroutine will croak if it is not
           provided.

           For example, adding the following block to a template will initialize the three named variables,  and
           will fail if no "a =&gt; '...'" argument pair is passed:

             &lt;%args&gt;
               $a
               @b =&gt; qw( foo bar baz )
               %c =&gt; ()
             &lt;/%args&gt;

           All  the  arguments  are available as lexically scoped ("my") variables in the rest of the component.
           Default expressions are evaluated in top-to-bottom order, and one expression may reference an earlier
           one.

           Only valid Perl variable names may be used in &lt;%args&gt; sections. Parameters  with  non-valid  variable
           names cannot be pre-declared and must be fetched manually out of the %ARGS hash.

       •   &lt;%init&gt; <u>perl_code</u> &lt;/%init&gt;

           Similar  to  a  %perl  block,  except  that the code is moved up to the start of the subroutine. This
           allows a template's initialization code to be moved to the end of the file rather than  requiring  it
           to be at the top.

           For example, the following template text will return a scheduled greeting:

               Good &lt;% $daypart %&gt;.
               &lt;%init&gt;
                 my $daypart = (localtime)[2]&gt;11 ? 'afternoon' : 'morning';
               &lt;/%init&gt;

       •   &lt;%cleanup&gt; <u>perl_code</u> &lt;/%cleanup&gt;

           Similar to a %perl block, except that the code is moved down to the end of the subroutine.

       •   &lt;%once&gt; <u>perl_code</u> &lt;/%once&gt;

           Similar to a %perl block, except that the code is executed once, when the template is first compiled.
           (If  a  caller  is using execute, this code will be run repeatedly, but if they call compile and then
           invoke the resulting subroutine  multiple  times,  the  %once  code  will  only  execute  during  the
           compilation step.)

           This  code  does  not  have  access  to  %ARGS and can not generate output.  It can be used to define
           constants, create persistent variables, or otherwise prepare the environment.

           For example, the following template text will return a increasing number each time it is called:

               &lt;%once&gt;
                 my $counter = 1000;
               &lt;/%once&gt;
               The count is &lt;% ++ $counter %&gt;.

       •   &lt;%doc&gt; ... &lt;/%doc&gt;

           Provides space for template developer documentation or comments which are not included in the output.

       •   &lt;%text&gt; ... &lt;/%text&gt;

           Produces literal text in the template output. Can be used to surround text that contains other markup
           tags that should not be interpreted.

           Equivalent to un-marked-up text.

       The following types of named blocks are not supported by HTML::Mason, but are supported here as  a  side-
       effect of the way the lexer and assembler are implemented.

       •   &lt;%expr&gt; ... &lt;/%expr&gt;

           A  Perl  expression  to  be  interpolated  into the result.  The block may span multiple lines and is
           scoped inside a "do" block, so it may contain multiple Perl statements and it need  not  end  with  a
           semicolon.

           Equivalent to the "&lt;% ... %&gt;" markup syntax.

       •   &lt;%file&gt; <u>template_filename</u>, <u>arguments</u> &lt;/%file&gt;

           Includes  the  results  of  a separate file containing MicroMason code, compiling it and executing it
           with any arguments passed after the filename.

             &lt;%file&gt; "greeting.msn", hour =&gt; (localtime)[2] &lt;/%file&gt;

           Equivalent to the "&lt;&amp; ... &amp;&gt;" markup syntax.

</pre><h4><b>TEMPLATE</b> <b>CODING</b> <b>TECHNIQUES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Assembling</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Source</b> <b>Code</b>
       When Text::MicroMason::Base assembles your lexed template into the equivalent Perl subroutine, all of the
       literal  (non-Perl)  pieces  are  converted  to  "$_out-&gt;('text');"  statements,  and  the   interpolated
       expressions  are  converted  to "$_out-&gt;( do { expr } );" statements.  Code from %perl blocks and % lines
       are included exactly as-is.

       Your code is eval'd in the "Text::MicroMason::Commands" package.  The "use strict;" pragma is enabled  by
       default to simplify debugging.

   <b>Internal</b> <b>Sub-templates</b>
       You can create sub-templates within your template text by defining them as anonymous subroutines and then
       calling  them  repeatedly.   For  example,  the  following  template  will concatenate the results of the
       draw_item sub-template for each of three items:

           &lt;h1&gt;We've Got Items!&lt;/h1&gt;

           % my $draw_item = sub {
             &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;% $_[0] %&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
               &lt;a href="/more?item=&lt;% $_[0] %&gt;"&gt;See more about &lt;% $_[0] %&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
           % };

           &lt;%perl&gt;
             foreach my $item ( qw( Foo Bar Baz ) ) {
               $draw_item-&gt;( $item );
             }
           &lt;/%perl&gt;

   <b>Returning</b> <b>Text</b> <b>from</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Blocks</b>
       To append to the result from within Perl code, call $_out-&gt;(<u>text</u>).  (The $_out-&gt;() syntax is  unavailable
       in older versions of Perl; use the equivalent &amp;$<b>_out()</b> syntax instead.)

       For example, the below template text will return '123456789' when it is evaluated:

           &lt;%perl&gt;
             foreach my $digit ( 1 .. 9 ) {
               $_out-&gt;( $digit )
             }
           &lt;/%perl&gt;

       You can also directly manipulate the value @OUT, which contains the accumulating result.

       For  example,  the  below template text will return an altered version of its message if a true value for
       'minor' is passed as an argument when the template is executed:

           This is a funny joke.
           % if ( $ARGS{minor} ) { foreach ( @OUT ) { tr[a-z][n-za-m] } }
