</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Text::Reflow - Perl module for reflowing text files using Knuth's paragraphing algorithm.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Text::Reflow qw(reflow_file reflow_string reflow_array);

               reflow_file($infile, $outfile, key =&gt; value, ...);

               $output = reflow_string($input, key =&gt; value, ...);

               $output = reflow_array(\@input, key =&gt; value, ...);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These routines will reflow the paragraphs in the given file, filehandle, string or array using Knuth's
       paragraphing algorithm (as used in TeX) to pick "good" places to break the lines.

       Each routine takes ascii text data with paragraphs separated by blank lines and reflows the paragraphs.
       If two or more lines in a row are "indented" then they are assumed to be a quoted poem and are passed
       through unchanged (but see below)

       The reflow algorithm tries to keep the lines the same length but also tries to break at punctuation, and
       avoid breaking within a proper name or after certain <u>connectives</u> ("a", "the", etc.). The result is a file
       with a more "ragged" right margin than is produced by "fmt" or "Text::Wrap" but it is easier to read
       since fewer phrases are broken across line breaks.

       For "reflow_file", if $infile is the empty string, then the input is taken from STDIN and if $outfile is
       the empty string, the output is written to STDOUT.  Otherwise, $infile and $outfile may be a string, a
       FileHandle reference or a FileHandle glob.

       A typical invocation is:

               reflow_file("myfile", "");

       which reflows the whole of <u>myfile</u> and prints the result to STDOUT.

   <b>KEYWORD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       The behaviour of Reflow can be adjusted by setting various keyword options.  These can be set globally by
       referencing the appropriate variable in the Text::Reflow package, for example:

               $Text::Reflow::maximum = 80;
               $Text::Reflow::optimum = 75;

       will set the maximum line length to 80 characters and the optimum line length to 75 characters for all
       subsequent reflow operations.  Or they can be passed to a reflow_ function as a keyword parameter, for
       example:

               $out = reflow_string($in, maximum =&gt; 80, optimum =&gt; 75);

       in which case the new options only apply to this call.

       The following options are currently implemented, with their default values:

       optimum =&gt; [65]
           The  optimum  line  length  in characters.  This can be either a number or a reference to an array of
           numbers:  in the latter case, each optimal line length is tried in turn for each paragraph,  and  the
           one which leads to the best overall paragraph is chosen.  This results in less ragged paragraphs, but
           some paragraphs will be wider or narrower overall than others.

       maximum =&gt; 75
           The maximum allowed line length.

       indent =&gt; ""
           Each  line  of  output  has  this  string  prepended. "indent =&gt; string" is equivalent to "indent1 =&gt;
           string, indent2 =&gt; string".

       indent1 =&gt; ""
           A string which is used to indent the first line in any paragraph.

       indent2 =&gt; ""
           A string which is used to indent the second and subsequent line in any paragraph.

       quote =&gt; ""
           Characters to strip from the beginning of a line before processing.  To reflow a quoted email message
           and then restore the quotes you might want to use

                   quote =&gt; "&gt; ", indent =&gt; "&gt; "

       skipto =&gt; ""
           Skip to the first line starting with the given pattern before starting to reflow. This is useful  for
           skipping Project Gutenberg headers or contents tables.

       skipindented =&gt; 2
           If  "skipindented"  =  0  then  all  indented lines are flowed in with the surrounding paragraph.  If
           "skipindented" = 1 then any indented line will not be reflowed.  If "skipindented" = 2 then  any  two
           or  more  adjacent indented lines will not be reflowed.  The purpose of the default value is to allow
           poetry to pass through unchanged, but not to allow a paragraph indentation from preventing the  first
           line of the paragraph from being reflowed.

       noreflow =&gt; ""
           A  pattern  to  indicate that certain lines should not be reflowed.  For example, a table of contents
           might have a line of dots.  The option:

                   noreflow =&gt; '(\.\s*){4}\.'

           will not reflow any lines containing five or more consecutive dots.

       frenchspacing =&gt; 'n'
           Normally two spaces are put at the end of a sentence or a clause.  The "frenchspacing" option  (taken
           from the TeX macro of the same name) disables this feature.

       oneparagraph =&gt; 'n'
           Set  this  to  'y'  if  you want the whole input to be flowed into a single paragraph, ignoring blank
           lines in the input.

       semantic =&gt; 30
           This parameter indicates the extent to  which  semantic  factors  matter  (breaking  on  punctuation,
           avoiding  a  break  within  a clause etc.).  Set this to zero to minimise the raggedness of the right
           margin, at the expense of readability.

       namebreak =&gt; 10
           Penalty for splitting up a name

       sentence =&gt; 20
           Penalty for sentence widows and orphans (ie splitting a line immediately after the first  word  in  a
           sentence, or before the last word in a sentence)

       independent =&gt; 10
           Penalty for independent clause widows and orphans.

       dependent =&gt; 6
           Penalty for dependent clause widows and orphans.

       shortlast =&gt; 5
           Penalty for a short last line in a paragraph (one or two words).

       connpenalty =&gt; 1
           Multiplier  for the "negative penalty" for breaking at a connective.  In other words, increasing this
           value makes connectives an even more attractive place to break a line.

   <b>EXPORT</b>
       None by default.
