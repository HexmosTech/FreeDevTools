</pre><h4><b>ABSTRACT</b></h4><pre>
       Text::Textile is a Perl-based implementation of Dean Allen's Textile syntax. Textile is shorthand for
       doing common formatting tasks.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new(</b> <b>[%options]</b> <b>)</b>
       Instantiates a new Text::Textile object. Optional options can be passed to initialize the object.
       Attributes for the options key are the same as the get/set method names documented here.

   <b>set(</b> <b>$attribute,</b> <b>$value</b> <b>)</b>
       Used to set Textile attributes. Attribute names are the same as the get/set method names documented here.

   <b>get(</b> <b>$attribute</b> <b>)</b>
       Used to get Textile attributes. Attribute names are the same as the get/set method names documented here.

   <b>disable_html(</b> <b>[$disable]</b> <b>)</b>
       Gets or sets the "disable html" control, which allows you to prevent HTML tags from being used within the
       text processed.  Any HTML tags encountered will be removed if disable html is enabled. Default behavior
       is to allow HTML.

   <b>flavor(</b> <b>[$flavor]</b> <b>)</b>
       Assigns the HTML flavor of output from Text::Textile. Currently these are the valid choices: html, xhtml
       (behaves like "xhtml1"), xhtml1, xhtml2. Default flavor is "xhtml1".

       Note that the xhtml2 flavor support is experimental and incomplete (and will remain that way until the
       XHTML 2.0 draft becomes a proper recommendation).

   <b>css(</b> <b>[$css]</b> <b>)</b>
       Gets or sets the CSS support for Textile. If CSS is enabled, Textile will emit CSS rules. You may pass a
       1 or 0 to enable or disable CSS behavior altogether. If you pass a hashref, you may assign the CSS class
       names that are used by Text::Textile. The following key names for such a hash are recognized:

       class_align_right
           defaults to "right"

       class_align_left
           defaults to "left"

       class_align_center
           defaults to "center"

       class_align_top
           defaults to "top"

       class_align_bottom
           defaults to "bottom"

       class_align_middle
           defaults to "middle"

       class_align_justify
           defaults to "justify"

       class_caps
           defaults to "caps"

       class_footnote
           defaults to "footnote"

       id_footnote_prefix
           defaults to "fn"

   <b>charset(</b> <b>[$charset]</b> <b>)</b>
       Gets  or  sets  the character set targeted for publication.  At this time, Text::Textile only changes its
       behavior if the "utf-8" character set is assigned.

       Specifically, if utf-8 is requested, any special characters created by Textile will be output  as  native
       utf-8 characters rather than HTML entities.

   <b>docroot(</b> <b>[$path]</b> <b>)</b>
       Gets  or  sets  the  physical file path to root of document files.  This path is utilized when images are
       referenced and size  calculations  are  needed  (the  Image::Size  module  is  used  to  read  the  image
       dimensions).

   <b>trim_spaces(</b> <b>[$trim]</b> <b>)</b>
       Gets  or sets the "trim spaces" control flag. If enabled, this will clear any lines that have only spaces
       on them (the newline itself will remain).

   <b>preserve_spaces(</b> <b>[$preserve]</b> <b>)</b>
       Gets or sets the "preserve spaces" control flag. If enabled, this will replace any double  spaces  within
       the  paragraph data with the &amp;#8195; HTML entity (wide space). The default is 0. Spaces will pass through
       to the browser unchanged and render as a single space.  Note that this setting has no  effect  on  spaces
       within "&lt;pre&gt;", "&lt;code&gt;" or "&lt;script&gt;".

   <b>filter_param(</b> <b>[$data]</b> <b>)</b>
       Gets or sets a parameter that is passed to filters.

   <b>filters(</b> <b>[\%filters]</b> <b>)</b>
       Gets  or  sets  a list of filters to make available for Text::Textile to use. Returns a hash reference of
       the currently assigned filters.

   <b>char_encoding(</b> <b>[$encode]</b> <b>)</b>
       Gets or sets the character encoding logical flag. If character encoding is  enabled,  the  HTML::Entities
       package  is  used to encode special characters. If character encoding is disabled, only "&lt;", "&gt;", """ and
       "&amp;" are encoded to HTML entities.

   <b>disable_encode_entities(</b> <b>$boolean</b> <b>)</b>
       Gets or sets the disable encode entities logical flag. If this value is  set  to  true  no  entities  are
       encoded at all. This also supersedes the "char_encoding" flag.

   <b>handle_quotes(</b> <b>[$handle]</b> <b>)</b>
       Gets or sets the "smart quoting" control flag. Returns the current setting.

   <b>process(</b> <b>$str</b> <b>)</b>
       Alternative method for invoking the textile method.

   <b>textile(</b> <b>$str</b> <b>)</b>
       Can be called either procedurally or as a method. Transforms <u>$str</u> using Textile markup rules.

   <b>format_paragraph(</b> <b>[$args]</b> <b>)</b>
       Processes a single paragraph. The following attributes are allowed:

       text
           The text to be processed.

   <b>format_inline(</b> <b>[%args]</b> <b>)</b>
       Processes an inline string (plaintext) for Textile syntax.  The following attributes are allowed:

       text
           The text to be processed.

   <b>format_macro(</b> <b>%args</b> <b>)</b>
       Responsible for processing a particular macro. Arguments passed include:

       pre open brace character

       post
           close brace character

       macro
           the macro to be executed

       The  return value from this method would be the replacement text for the macro given. If the macro is not
       defined, it will return pre + macro + post, thereby preserving the original macro string.

   <b>format_cite(</b> <b>%args</b> <b>)</b>
       Processes text for a citation tag. The following attributes are allowed:

       pre Any text that comes before the citation.

       text
           The text that is being cited.

       cite
           The URL of the citation.

       post
           Any text that follows the citation.

   <b>format_code(</b> <b>%args</b> <b>)</b>
       Processes '@...@' type blocks (code snippets). The following attributes are allowed:

       text
           The text of the code itself.

       lang
           The language (programming language) for the code.

   <b>format_classstyle(</b> <b>$clsty,</b> <b>$class,</b> <b>$style</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns a string of tag attributes to accommodate the class, style and symbols present in $clsty.

       <u>$clsty</u> is checked for:

       "{...}"
           style rules. If present, they are appended to $style.

       "(...#...)"
           class and/or ID name declaration

       "(" (one or more)
           pad left characters

       ")" (one or more)
           pad right characters

       "[ll]"
           language declaration

       The attribute string returned will contain any combination of class, id, style and/or lang attributes.

   <b>format_tag(</b> <b>%args</b> <b>)</b>
       Constructs an HTML tag. Accepted arguments:

       tag the tag to produce

       text
           the text to output inside the tag

       pre text to produce before the tag

       post
           text to produce following the tag

       clsty
           class and/or style attributes that should be assigned to the tag.

   <b>format_list(</b> <b>%args</b> <b>)</b>
       Takes a Textile formatted list (numeric or bulleted) and returns the markup for it. Text that  is  passed
       in  requires  substantial  parsing,  so the format_list method is a little involved. But it should always
       produce a proper ordered or unordered list. If it cannot (due to misbalanced input), it will  return  the
       original text. Arguments accepted:

       text
           The text to be processed.

   <b>format_block(</b> <b>%args</b> <b>)</b>
       Processes  "==xxxxx=="  type  blocks  for  filters.  A  filter would follow the open "==" sequence and is
       specified within pipe characters, like so:

           ==|filter|text to be filtered==

       You may specify multiple filters in the filter portion of the string. Simply comma  delimit  the  filters
       you desire to execute. Filters are defined using the filters method.

   <b>format_link(</b> <b>%args</b> <b>)</b>
       Takes the Textile link attributes and transforms them into a hyperlink.

   <b>format_url(</b> <b>%args</b> <b>)</b>
       Takes the given $url and transforms it appropriately.

   <b>format_span(</b> <b>%args</b> <b>)</b>
   <b>format_image(</b> <b>%args</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns  markup  for  the  given  image.  $src is the location of the image, $extra contains the optional
       height/width and/or alt text. $url is an optional hyperlink for the image. $class holds the optional  CSS
       class attribute.

       Arguments you may pass:

       src The  "src"  (URL) for the image. This may be a local path, ideally starting with a "/". Images can be
           located within the file system if the docroot method is used to specify where the docroot resides. If
           the image can be found, the image_size method is used to determine the dimensions of the image.

       extra
           Additional parameters for the image. This would  include  alt  text,  height/width  specification  or
           scaling instructions.

       align
           Alignment attribute.

       pre Text to produce prior to the tag.

       post
           Text to produce following the tag.

       link
           Optional URL to connect with the image tag.

       clsty
           Class and/or style attributes.

   <b>format_table(</b> <b>%args</b> <b>)</b>
       Takes a Wiki-ish string of data and transforms it into a full table.

   <b>apply_filters(</b> <b>%args</b> <b>)</b>
       The following attributes are allowed:

       text
           The text to be processed.

       filters
           An array reference of filter names to run for the given text.

   <b>encode_html(</b> <b>$html,</b> <b>$can_double_encode</b> <b>)</b>
       Encodes  input  $html  string,  escaping  characters  as  needed  to  HTML  entities.  This relies on the
       HTML::Entities package for  full  effect.  If  unavailable,  encode_html_basic  is  used  as  a  fallback
       technique. If the "char_encoding" flag is set to false, encode_html_basic is used exclusively.

   <b>decode_html(</b> <b>$html</b> <b>)</b>
       Decodes HTML entities in $html to their natural character equivelants.

   <b>encode_html_basic(</b> <b>$html,</b> <b>$can_double_encode</b> <b>)</b>
       Encodes  the  input  $html  string  for the following characters: &lt;, &gt;, &amp; and ". If $can_double_encode is
       true, all ampersand characters are escaped even if they already were.  If  $can_double_encode  is  false,
       ampersands are only escaped when they aren't part of a HTML entity already.

   <b>image_size(</b> <b>$file</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns the size for the image identified in $file. This method relies upon the Image::Size Perl package.
       If unavailable, image_size will return undef. Otherwise, the expected return value is a list of the width
       and height (in that order), in pixels.

   <b>encode_url(</b> <b>$str</b> <b>)</b>
       Encodes the query portion of a URL, escaping characters as necessary.

   <b>mail_encode(</b> <b>$email</b> <b>)</b>
       Encodes the email address in <u>$email</u> for "mailto:" links.

   <b>process_quotes(</b> <b>$str</b> <b>)</b>
       Processes string, formatting plain quotes into curly quotes.

   <b>default_macros</b>
       Returns a hashref of macros that are assigned to be processed by default within the format_inline method.

   <b>_halign(</b> <b>$alignment</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns the alignment keyword depending on the symbol passed.

       "&lt;&gt;"
           becomes "justify"

       "&lt;" becomes "left"

       "&gt;" becomes "right"

       "=" becomes "center"

   <b>_valign(</b> <b>$alignment</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns the alignment keyword depending on the symbol passed.

       "^" becomes "top"

       "~" becomes "bottom"

       "-" becomes "middle"

   <b>_imgalign(</b> <b>$alignment</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns  the  alignment  keyword  depending  on  the  symbol passed.  The following alignment symbols are
       recognized, and given preference in the order listed:

       "^" becomes "top"

       "~" becomes "bottom"

       "-" becomes "middle"

       "&lt;" becomes "left"

       "&gt;" becomes "right"

   <b>_repl(</b> <b>\@arr,</b> <b>$str</b> <b>)</b>
       An internal routine that takes a string and appends it to an array.  It returns a  marker  that  is  used
       later to restore the preserved string.

   <b>_tokenize(</b> <b>$str</b> <b>)</b>
       An internal routine responsible for breaking up a string into individual tag and plaintext elements.

   <b>_css_defaults</b>
       Sets  the  default  CSS  names for CSS controlled markup. This is an internal function that should not be
       called directly.

   <b>_strip_borders(</b> <b>$pre,</b> <b>$post</b> <b>)</b>
       This utility routine will take "border" characters off of the given $pre and $post strings if they  match
       one of these conditions:

           $pre starts with "[", $post ends with "]"
           $pre starts with "{", $post ends with "}"

       If neither condition is met, then the $pre and $post values are left untouched.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       Text::Textile processes text in units of blocks and lines.  A block might also be considered a paragraph,
       since blocks are separated from one another by a blank line. Blocks can begin with a signature that helps
       identify the rest of the block content. Block signatures include:

       p   A  paragraph block. This is the default signature if no signature is explicitly given. Paragraphs are
           formatted with all the inline rules (see inline formatting) and each line  receives  the  appropriate
           markup  rules  for  the flavor of HTML in use. For example, newlines for XHTML content receive a "&lt;br
           /&gt;" tag at the end of the line (with the exception of the last line  in  the  paragraph).   Paragraph
           blocks are enclosed in a "&lt;p&gt;" tag.

       pre A pre-formatted block of text. Textile will not add any HTML tags for individual lines. Whitespace is
           also preserved.

           Note that within a "pre" block, &lt; and &gt; are translated into HTML entities automatically.

       bc  A  "bc"  signature  is  short  for  "block code", which implies a preformatted section like the "pre"
           block, but it also gets a "&lt;code&gt;" tag (or for XHTML 2, a "&lt;blockcode&gt;" tag is used instead).

           Note that within a "bc" block, &lt; and &gt; are translated into HTML entities automatically.

       table
           For composing HTML tables. See the "TABLES" section for more information.

       bq  A "bq" signature is short for "block quote". Paragraph text formatting is applied to these blocks and
           they are enclosed in a &lt;blockquote&gt; tag as well as &lt;p&gt; tags within.

       h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
           Headline signatures that produce "&lt;h1&gt;", etc. tags.  You can adjust  the  relative  output  of  these
           using the head_offset attribute.

       clear
           A  "clear" signature is simply used to indicate that the next block should emit a CSS style attribute
           that clears any floating elements. The default behavior is to clear "both", but you can use the  left
           (&lt;) or right (&gt;) alignment characters to indicate which side to clear.

       dl  A "dl" signature is short for "definition list". See the "LISTS" section for more information.

       fn  A  "fn"  signature is short for "footnote". You add a number following the "fn" keyword to number the
           footnote. Footnotes are output as paragraph tags but are given a special CSS class name which can  be
           used to style them as you see fit.

       All  signatures  should  end  with a period and be followed with a space. Inbetween the signature and the
       period, you may use several parameters to further customize the block.  These include:

       "{style rule}"
           A CSS style rule. Style rules can span multiple lines.

       "[ll]"
           A language identifier (for a "lang" attribute).

       "(class)" or "(#id)" or "(class#id)"
           For CSS class and id attributes.

       "&gt;", "&lt;", "=", "&lt;&gt;"
           Modifier characters for  alignment.  Right-justification,  left-justification,  centered,  and  full-
           justification.

       "(" (one or more)
           Adds  padding  on  the  left. 1em per "(" character is applied.  When combined with the align-left or
           align-right modifier, it makes the block float.

       ")" (one or more)
           Adds padding on the right. 1em per ")" character is applied.  When combined with  the  align-left  or
           align-right modifier, it makes the block float.

       "|filter|" or "|filter|filter|filter|"
           A  filter  may  be  invoked to further format the text for this signature. If one or more filters are
           identified, the text will be processed first using the  filters  and  then  by  Textile's  own  block
           formatting rules.

   <b>Extended</b> <b>Blocks</b>
       Normally,  a  block  ends with the first blank line encountered.  However, there are situations where you
       may want a block to continue for multiple paragraphs of text. To cause a given block  signature  to  stay
       active,  use  two  periods  in  your signature instead of one.  This will tell Textile to keep processing
       using that signature until it hits the next signature is found.

       For example:

           bq.. This is paragraph one of a block quote.

           This is paragraph two of a block quote.

           p. Now we're back to a regular paragraph.

       You can apply this technique to any signature (although for some it doesn't make  sense,  like  "h1"  for
       example).  This  is especially useful for "bc" blocks where your code may have many blank lines scattered
       through it.

   <b>Escaping</b>
       Sometimes you want Textile to just get out of the way and let you put some regular HTML  markup  in  your
       document. You can disable Textile formatting for a given block using the "==" escape mechanism:

           p. Regular paragraph

           ==
           Escaped portion -- will not be formatted
           by Textile at all
           ==

           p. Back to normal.

       You  can  also  use  this  technique  within a Textile block, temporarily disabling the inline formatting
       functions:

           p. This is ==*a test*== of escaping.

   <b>Inline</b> <b>Formatting</b>
       Formatting within a block of text is covered by the "inline" formatting rules. These  operators  must  be
       placed up against text/punctuation to be recognized. These include:

       *"strong"*
           Translates into &lt;strong&gt;strong&lt;/strong&gt;.

       "_emphasis_"
           Translates into &lt;em&gt;emphasis&lt;/em&gt;.

       **"bold"**
           Translates into &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;.

       "__italics__"
           Translates into &lt;i&gt;italics&lt;/i&gt;.

       "++bigger++"
           Translates into &lt;big&gt;bigger&lt;/big&gt;.

       "--smaller--"
           Translates into: &lt;small&gt;smaller&lt;/small&gt;.

       "-deleted text-"
           Translates into &lt;del&gt;deleted text&lt;/del&gt;.

       "+inserted text+"
           Translates into &lt;ins&gt;inserted text&lt;/ins&gt;.

       "^superscript^"
           Translates into &lt;sup&gt;superscript&lt;/sup&gt;.

       "~subscript~"
           Translates into &lt;sub&gt;subscript&lt;/sub&gt;.

       "%span%"
           Translates into &lt;span&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;.

       "@code@"
           Translates  into  &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;.  Note that within a "@...@" section, &lt; and &gt; are translated into
           HTML entities automatically.

       Inline formatting operators accept the following modifiers:

       "{style rule}"
           A CSS style rule.

       "[ll]"
           A language identifier (for a "lang" attribute).

       "(class)" or "(#id)" or "(class#id)"
           For CSS class and id attributes.

       <u>Examples</u>

           Textile is *way* cool.

           Textile is *_way_* cool.

       Now this won't work, because the formatting characters need whitespace before and after  to  be  properly
       recognized.

           Textile is way c*oo*l.

       However,  you  can  supply  braces  or brackets to further clarify that you want to format, so this would
       work:

           Textile is way c[*oo*]l.

   <b>Footnotes</b>
       You can create footnotes like this:

           And then he went on a long trip[1].

       By specifying the brackets with a number inside, Textile will recognize that as  a  footnote  marker.  It
       will replace that with a construct like this:

           And then he went on a long
           trip&lt;sup class="footnote"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

       To supply the content of the footnote, place it at the end of your document using a "fn" block signature:

           fn1. And there was much rejoicing.

       Which creates a paragraph that looks like this:

           &lt;p class="footnote" id="fn1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; And there was
           much rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <b>Links</b>
       Textile defines a shorthand for formatting hyperlinks.  The format looks like this:

           "Text to display":<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>

       In addition to this, you can add "title" text to your link:

           "Text to display (Title text)":<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>

       The  URL  portion  of the link supports relative paths as well as other protocols like ftp, mailto, news,
       telnet, etc.

           "E-mail me please":<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">mailto:someone@example.com</a>

       You can also use single quotes instead of double-quotes if you prefer.  As  with  the  inline  formatting
       rules,  a  hyperlink  must  be  surrounded by whitespace to be recognized (an exception to this is common
       punctuation which can reside at the end of the URL). If you have to place a URL next to some other  text,
       use the bracket or brace trick to do that:

           You["gotta":<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>]seethis!

       Textile  supports an alternate way to compose links. You can optionally create a lookup list of links and
       refer to them separately. To do this, place one or more links in a block of it's own (it can be  anywhere
       within your document):

           [excom]<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>
           [exorg]<a href="http://example.org">http://example.org</a>

       For  a  list  like  this, the text in the square brackets is used to uniquely identify the link given. To
       refer to that link, you would specify it like this:

           "Text to display":excom

       Once you've defined your link lookup table, you can use the identifiers any number of times.

   <b>Images</b>
       Images are identified by the following pattern:

           !/path/to/image!

       Image attributes may also be specified:

           !/path/to/image 10x20!

       Which will render an image 10 pixels wide and 20 pixels high.  Another way to indicate width and height:

           !/path/to/image 10w 20h!

       You may also redimension the image using a percentage.

           !/path/to/image 20%x40%!

       Which will render the image at 20% of it's regular width and 40% of it's regular height.

       Or specify one percentage to resize proprotionately:

           !/path/to/image 20%!

       Alt text can be given as well:

           !/path/to/image (Alt text)!

       The path of the image may refer to a locally hosted image or can be a full URL.

       You can also use the following modifiers after the opening "!"  character:

       "&lt;" Align the image to the left (causes the image to float if CSS options are enabled).

       "&gt;" Align the image to the right (causes the image to float if CSS options are enabled).

       "-" (dash)
           Aligns the image to the middle.

       "^" Aligns the image to the top.

       "~" (tilde)
           Aligns the image to the bottom.

       "{style rule}"
           Applies a CSS style rule to the image.

       "(class)" or "(#id)" or "(class#id)"
           Applies a CSS class and/or id to the image.

       "(" (one or more)
           Pads 1em on the left for each "(" character.

       ")" (one or more)
           Pads 1em on the right for each ")" character.

   <b>Character</b> <b>Replacements</b>
       A few simple, common symbols are automatically replaced:

           (c)
           (r)
           (tm)

       In addition to these, there are a whole set of character macros that are defined by default.  All  macros
       are enclosed in curly braces. These include:

           {c|} or {|c} cent sign
           {L-} or {-L} pound sign
           {Y=} or {=Y} yen sign

       Many of these macros can be guessed. For example:

           {A'} or {'A}
           {a"} or {"a}
           {1/4}
           {*}
           {:)}
           {:(}

   <b>Lists</b>
       Textile  also supports ordered and unordered lists.  You simply place an asterisk or pound sign, followed
       with a space at the start of your lines.

       Simple lists:

           * one
           * two
           * three

       Multi-level lists:

           * one
           ** one A
           ** one B
           *** one B1
           * two
           ** two A
           ** two B
           * three

       Ordered lists:

           # one
           # two
           # three

       Styling lists:

           (class#id)* one
           * two
           * three

       The above sets the class and id attributes for the &lt;ul&gt; tag.

           *(class#id) one
           * two
           * three

       The above sets the class and id attributes for the first &lt;li&gt; tag.

       Definition lists:

           dl. textile:a cloth, especially one manufactured by weaving
           or knitting; a fabric
           format:the arrangement of data for storage or display.

       Note that there is no space between the term and definition. The term must be at the start  of  the  line
       (or following the "dl" signature as shown above).

   <b>Tables</b>
       Textile  supports  tables. Tables must be in their own block and must have pipe characters delimiting the
       columns. An optional block signature of "table" may be used, usually for applying  style,  class,  id  or
       other options to the table element itself.

       From the simple:

           |a|b|c|
           |1|2|3|

       To the complex:

           table(fig). {color:red}_|Top|Row|
           {color:blue}|/2. Second|Row|
           |_{color:green}. Last|

       Modifiers  can  be  specified  for  the  table  signature itself, for a table row (prior to the first "|"
       character) and for any cell (following the "|" for that cell). Note that for  cells,  a  period  followed
       with a space must be placed after any modifiers to distinguish the modifier from the cell content.

       Modifiers allowed are:

       "{style rule}"
           A CSS style rule.

       "(class)" or "(#id)" or "(class#id)"
           A CSS class and/or id attribute.

       "(" (one or more)
           Adds 1em of padding to the left for each "(" character.

       ")" (one or more)
           Adds 1em of padding to the right for each ")" character.

       "&lt;" Aligns to the left (floats to left for tables if combined with the ")" modifier).

       "&gt;" Aligns to the right (floats to right for tables if combined with the "(" modifier).

       "=" Aligns to center (sets left, right margins to "auto" for tables).

       "&lt;&gt;"
           For cells only. Justifies text.

       "^" For rows and cells only. Aligns to the top.

       "~" (tilde)
           For rows and cells only. Aligns to the bottom.

       "_" (underscore)
           Can be applied to a table row or cell to indicate a header row or cell.

       "\2" or "\3" or "\4", etc.
           Used  within  cells  to  indicate  a colspan of 2, 3, 4, etc. columns.  When you see "\", think "push
           forward".

       "/2" or "/3" or "/4", etc.
           Used within cells to indicate a rowspan or 2, 3, 4,  etc.  rows.   When  you  see  "/",  think  "push
           downward".

       When  a  cell  is  identified  as  a  header cell and an alignment is specified, that becomes the default
       alignment for cells below it. You can always override this behavior by specifying an alignment for one of
       the lower cells.

   <b>CSS</b> <b>Notes</b>
       When CSS is enabled (and it is by  default),  CSS  class  names  are  automatically  applied  in  certain
       situations.

       Aligning a block or span or other element to left, right, etc.
           "left"  for  left  justified,  "right" for right justified, "center" for centered text, "justify" for
           full-justified text.

       Aligning an image to the top or bottom
           "top" for top alignment, "bottom" for bottom alignment, "middle" for middle alignment.

       Footnotes
           "footnote" is applied to the paragraph tag for the footnote text itself.  An  id  of  "fn"  plus  the
           footnote  number  is  placed  on the paragraph for the footnote as well. For the footnote superscript
           tag, a class of "footnote" is used.

       Capped text
           For a series of characters that are uppercased, a span is placed around them with a class of "caps".

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       Textile tries to do it's very best to ensure proper XHTML syntax. It will even attempt to fix errors  you
       may  introduce  writing  in HTML yourself. Unescaped "&amp;" characters within URLs will be properly escaped.
       Singlet tags such as br, img and hr are checked for the "/" terminator (and it's added if necessary). The
       best way to make sure you produce valid XHTML with Textile is to not use any HTML markup at all-- use the
       Textile syntax and let it produce the markup for you.
