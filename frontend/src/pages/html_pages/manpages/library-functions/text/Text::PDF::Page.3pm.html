</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Text::PDF::Page - Represents a PDF page, inherits from Text::PDF::Pages

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Represents a page of output in PDF. It also keeps track of the content stream, any resources (such as
       fonts) being switched, etc.

       Page inherits from Pages due to a number of shared methods. They are really structurally quite different.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       A page has various working variables:

       curstrm
           The currently open stream

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Text::PDF::Page-&gt;new($pdf,</b> <b>$parent,</b> <b>$index)</b>
       Creates a new page based on a pages object (perhaps the root object).

       The  page  is also added to the parent at this point, so pages are ordered in a PDF document in the order
       in which they are created rather than in the order they are closed.

       Only the essential elements in the page dictionary are created here, all others are  either  optional  or
       can be inherited.

       The  optional  index  value  indicates the index in the parent list that this page should be inserted (so
       that new pages need not be appended)

   <b>$p-&gt;add($str)</b>
       Adds the string to the currently active stream for this page. If no stream exists, then  one  is  created
       and added to the list of streams for this page.

       The  slightly cryptic name is an aim to keep it short given the number of times people are likely to have
       to type it.

   <b>$p-&gt;ship_out($pdf)</b>
       Ships the page out to the given output file context
