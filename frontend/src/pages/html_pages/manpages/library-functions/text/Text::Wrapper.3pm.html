</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Text::Wrapper - Word wrap text by breaking long lines

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 1.05 of Text::Wrapper, released January 18, 2014.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           require Text::Wrapper;
           $wrapper = Text::Wrapper-&gt;new(columns =&gt; 60, body_start =&gt; '    ');
           print $wrapper-&gt;wrap($text);
           $wrapper-&gt;<a href="../man70/columns.70.html">columns</a>(70);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Text::Wrapper provides simple word wrapping.  It breaks long lines, but does not alter spacing or remove
       existing line breaks.  If you're looking for more sophisticated text formatting, try the Text::Format
       module.

       Reasons to use Text::Wrapper instead of Text::Format:

       •   Text::Wrapper is significantly smaller.

       •   It does not alter existing whitespace or combine short lines.  It only breaks long lines.

       Again, if Text::Wrapper doesn't meet your needs, try Text::Format.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>body_start</b>
       The text that begins the second and following lines of a paragraph.  (Default '')

   <b>columns</b>
       The number of columns to use.  This includes any text in body_start or par_start.  (Default 70)

   <b>par_start</b>
       The text that begins the first line of each paragraph.  (Default '')

   <b>wrap_after</b>
       A  line  can  wrap  after any of the characters in this string.  Setting this to the empty string means a
       line will wrap only at whitespace.  (Default '-')

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>wrap</b>
         $wrapper-&gt;wrap($text)

       Returns a word wrapped copy of $text.  The original is not altered.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Text::Wrapper requires no configuration files or environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Does not handle tabs (they're treated just like spaces).

       All characters are treated as being the same width, including zero-width spaces and combining accents.

       Does not break words that can't fit on one line.
