       XML::Easy::Text - XML parsing and serialisation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use XML::Easy::Text qw(
               xml10_read_content_object xml10_read_element
               xml10_read_document xml10_read_extparsedent_object);

           $content = xml10_read_content_object($text);
           $element = xml10_read_element($text);
           $element = xml10_read_document($text);
           $content = xml10_read_extparsedent_object($text);

           use XML::Easy::Text qw(
               xml10_write_content xml10_write_element
               xml10_write_document xml10_write_extparsedent);

           $text = xml10_write_content($content);
           $text = xml10_write_element($element);
           $text = xml10_write_document($element, "UTF-8");
           $text = xml10_write_extparsedent($content, "UTF-8");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module supplies functions that parse and serialise XML data according to the XML 1.0 specification.

       This module is oriented towards the use of XML to represent data for interchange purposes, rather than
       the use of XML as markup of principally textual data.  It does not perform any schema processing, and
       does not interpret DTDs or any other kind of schema.  It adheres strictly to the XML specification, in
       all its awkward details, except for the aforementioned DTDs.

       XML data in memory is represented using a tree of XML::Easy::Content and XML::Easy::Element objects.
       Such a tree encapsulates all the structure and data content of an XML element or document, without any
       irrelevant detail resulting from the textual syntax.  These node trees are readily manipulated by the
       functions in XML::Easy::NodeBasics.

       The functions of this module are implemented in C for performance, with a pure Perl backup version (which
       has good performance compared to other pure Perl parsers) for systems that can't handle XS modules.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All functions "die" on error.

   <b>Parsing</b>
       These function take textual XML and extract the abstract XML content.  In the terminology of the XML
       specification, they constitute a non-validating processor: they check for well-formedness of the XML, but
       not for adherence of the content to any schema.

       The inputs (to be parsed) for these functions are always character strings.  XML text is frequently
       encoded using UTF-8, or some other Unicode encoding, so that it can contain characters from the full
       Unicode repertoire.  In that case, something must perform UTF-8 decoding (or decoding of some other
       character encoding) to convert the octets of a file to the characters on which these functions operate.
       A Perl I/O layer can do the job (see perlio), or it can be performed explicitly using the "decode"
       function in the Encode module.

       xml10_read_content_object(TEXT)
           <u>TEXT</u> must be a character string.  It is parsed against the <b>content</b> production of the XML 1.0 grammar;
           i.e.,  as  a  sequence  of the kind of matter that can appear between the start-tag and end-tag of an
           element.  Returns a reference to an XML::Easy::Content object.

           Normally  one  would  not  want  to  use  this  function  directly,  but  prefer   the   higher-level
           "xml10_read_document"  function.   This function exists for the construction of custom XML parsers in
           situations that don't match the full XML grammar.

       xml10_read_content_twine(TEXT)
           Performs the same parsing job as "xml10_read_content_object", but returns the resulting content chunk
           in the form of twine (see "Twine" in XML::Easy::NodeBasics) rather than a content object.

           The returned array must not be subsequently modified.  If possible, it will be marked as read-only in
           order to prevent modification.

       xml10_read_content(TEXT)
           Deprecated alias for "xml10_read_content_twine".

       xml10_read_element(TEXT)
           <u>TEXT</u> must be a character string.  It is parsed against the <b>element</b> production of the XML 1.0 grammar;
           i.e., as an item bracketed by  tags  and  containing  content  that  may  recursively  include  other
           elements.  Returns a reference to an XML::Easy::Element object.

           Normally   one   would  not  want  to  use  this  function  directly,  but  prefer  the  higher-level
           "xml10_read_document" function.  This function exists for the construction of custom XML  parsers  in
           situations that don't match the full XML grammar.

       xml10_read_document(TEXT)
           <u>TEXT</u>  must  be  a  character  string.   It  is  parsed against the <b>document</b> production of the XML 1.0
           grammar; i.e., as a root element (possibly containing subelements) optionally preceded  and  followed
           by  non-content  matter,  possibly headed by an XML declaration.  (A document type declaration is <u>not</u>
           accepted; this module does not process schemata.)   Returns  a  reference  to  an  XML::Easy::Element
           object  which  represents  the  root element.  Nothing is returned relating to the XML declaration or
           other non-content matter.

           This is the most likely function to use to process incoming  XML  data.   Beware  that  the  encoding
           declaration  in  the  XML  declaration,  if any, does not affect the interpretation of the input as a
           sequence of characters.

       xml10_read_extparsedent_object(TEXT)
           <u>TEXT</u> must be a character string.  It is parsed against the <b>extParsedEnt</b> production  of  the  XML  1.0
           grammar;  i.e., as a sequence of content (containing character data and subelements), possibly headed
           by a text declaration (which is similar to, but not the same as,  an  XML  declaration).   Returns  a
           reference to an XML::Easy::Content object.

           This  is a relatively obscure part of the XML grammar, used when a subpart of a document is stored in
           a separate file.  You're more likely to require the "xml10_read_document" function.

       xml10_read_extparsedent_twine(TEXT)
           Performs the same parsing job as "xml10_read_extparsedent_object", but returns the resulting  content
           chunk in the form of twine (see "Twine" in XML::Easy::NodeBasics) rather than a content object.

           The returned array must not be subsequently modified.  If possible, it will be marked as read-only in
           order to prevent modification.

       xml10_read_extparsedent(TEXT)
           Deprecated alias for "xml10_read_extparsedent_twine".

   <b>Serialisation</b>
       These  function take abstract XML data and serialise it as textual XML.  They do not perform indentation,
       default attribute suppression, or any other schema-dependent processing.

       The outputs of these functions are always character strings.  XML text is frequently encoded using UTF-8,
       or some other Unicode encoding, so that it can contain characters from the full Unicode  repertoire.   In
       that  case,  something  must  perform  UTF-8  encoding  (or encoding of some other character encoding) to
       convert the characters generated by these functions to the octets of a file.  A Perl I/O layer can do the
       job (see perlio), or it can be performed explicitly using the "encode" function in the Encode module.

       xml10_write_content(CONTENT)
           <u>CONTENT</u> must be a reference to either an XML::Easy::Content object or a twine array (see  "Twine"  in
           XML::Easy::NodeBasics).  The XML 1.0 textual representation of that content is returned.

       xml10_write_element(ELEMENT)
           <u>ELEMENT</u>  must  be a reference to an XML::Easy::Element object.  The XML 1.0 textual representation of
           that element is returned.

       xml10_write_document(ELEMENT[, ENCODING])
           <u>ELEMENT</u> must be a reference to an XML::Easy::Element object.  The XML 1.0 textual form of a  document
           with  that  element  as  the root element is returned.  The document includes an XML declaration.  If
           <u>ENCODING</u> is supplied, it must be a valid character encoding name, and the XML  declaration  specifies
           it  in  an encoding declaration.  (The returned string consists of unencoded characters regardless of
           the encoding specified.)

       xml10_write_extparsedent(CONTENT[, ENCODING])
           <u>CONTENT</u> must be a reference to either an XML::Easy::Content object or a twine array (see  "Twine"  in
           XML::Easy::NodeBasics).   The  XML  1.0  textual form of an external parsed entity encapsulating that
           content is returned.  If <u>ENCODING</u> is supplied, it must be a valid character encoding  name,  and  the
           returned  entity  includes  a  text  declaration  that  specifies  the  encoding  name in an encoding
           declaration.  (The returned string consists  of  unencoded  characters  regardless  of  the  encoding
           specified.)
