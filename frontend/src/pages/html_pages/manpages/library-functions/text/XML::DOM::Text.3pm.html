       XML::DOM::Text - A piece of XML text in XML::DOM

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       XML::DOM::Text extends XML::DOM::CharacterData, which extends XML::DOM::Node.

       The Text interface represents the textual content (termed character data in XML) of an Element or Attr.
       If there is no markup inside an element's content, the text is contained in a single object implementing
       the Text interface that is the only child of the element.  If there is markup, it is parsed into a list
       of elements and Text nodes that form the list of children of the element.

       When a document is first made available via the DOM, there is only one Text node for each block of text.
       Users may create adjacent Text nodes that represent the contents of a given element without any
       intervening markup, but should be aware that there is no way to represent the separations between these
       nodes in XML or HTML, so they will not (in general) persist between DOM editing sessions. The <b>normalize()</b>
       method on Element merges any such adjacent Text objects into a single node for each block of text; this
       is recommended before employing operations that depend on a particular document structure, such as
       navigation with XPointers.

   <b>METHODS</b>
       splitText (offset)
           Breaks  this  Text  node  into  two  Text  nodes at the specified offset, keeping both in the tree as
           siblings. This node then only contains all the content up to the offset point. And a new  Text  node,
           which  is inserted as the next sibling of this node, contains all the content at and after the offset
           point.

           Parameters:
            <u>offset</u>  The offset at which to split, starting from 0.

           Return Value: The new Text node.

           DOMExceptions:

           •   INDEX_SIZE_ERR

               Raised if the specified offset is negative or greater than the number of characters in data.

           •   NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR

               Raised if this node is readonly.
