       Text::Wrap - line wrapping to form simple paragraphs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Example</b> <b>1</b>

               use Text::Wrap;

               $initial_tab = "\t";    # Tab before first line
               $subsequent_tab = "";   # All other lines flush left

               print wrap($initial_tab, $subsequent_tab, @text);
               print fill($initial_tab, $subsequent_tab, @text);

               $lines = wrap($initial_tab, $subsequent_tab, @text);

               @paragraphs = fill($initial_tab, $subsequent_tab, @text);

       <b>Example</b> <b>2</b>

               use Text::Wrap qw(wrap $columns $huge);

               $columns = 132;         # Wrap at 132 characters
               $huge = 'die';
               $huge = 'wrap';
               $huge = 'overflow';

       <b>Example</b> <b>3</b>

               use Text::Wrap;

               $Text::Wrap::columns = 72;
               print wrap('', '', @text);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Text::Wrap::wrap() is a very simple paragraph formatter.  It formats a single paragraph at a time by
       breaking lines at word boundaries.  Indentation is controlled for the first line ($initial_tab) and all
       subsequent lines ($subsequent_tab) independently.  Please note: $initial_tab and $subsequent_tab are the
       literal strings that will be used: it is unlikely you would want to pass in a number.

       Text::Wrap::fill() is a simple multi-paragraph formatter.  It formats each paragraph separately and then
       joins them together when it's done.  It will destroy any whitespace in the original text.  It breaks text
       into paragraphs by looking for whitespace after a newline.  In other respects, it acts like <b>wrap()</b>.

       wrap() compresses trailing whitespace into one newline, and fill() deletes all trailing whitespace.

       Both wrap() and fill() return a single string.

       Unlike the old Unix <b><a href="../man1/fmt.1.html">fmt</a></b>(1) utility, this module correctly accounts for any Unicode combining characters
       (such as diacriticals) that may occur in each line for both expansion and unexpansion.  These are
       overstrike characters that do not increment the logical position.  Make sure you have the appropriate
       Unicode settings enabled.

</pre><h4><b>OVERRIDES</b></h4><pre>
       Text::Wrap::wrap() has a number of variables that control its behavior.  Because other modules might be
       using Text::Wrap::wrap() it is suggested that you leave these variables alone!  If you can't do that,
       then use "local($Text::Wrap::VARIABLE) = YOURVALUE" when you change the values so that the original value
       is restored.  This local() trick will not work if you import the variable into your own namespace.

       Lines are wrapped at $Text::Wrap::columns columns (default value: 76).  $Text::Wrap::columns should be
       set to the full width of your output device.  In fact, every resulting line will have length of no more
       than "$columns - 1".

       It is possible to control which characters terminate words by modifying $Text::Wrap::break. Set this to a
       string such as '[\s:]' (to break before spaces or colons) or a pre-compiled regexp such as "qr/[\s']/"
       (to break before spaces or apostrophes). The default is simply '\s'; that is, words are terminated by
       spaces.  (This means, among other things, that trailing punctuation  such as full stops or commas stay
       with the word they are "attached" to.)  Setting $Text::Wrap::break to a regular expression that doesn't
       eat any characters (perhaps just a forward look-ahead assertion) will cause warnings.

       Beginner note: In example 2, above $columns is imported into the local namespace, and set locally.  In
       example 3, $Text::Wrap::columns is set in its own namespace without importing it.

       Text::Wrap::wrap() starts its work by expanding all the tabs in its input into spaces.  The last thing it
       does it to turn spaces back into tabs.  If you do not want tabs in your results, set
       $Text::Wrap::unexpand to a false value.  Likewise if you do not want to use 8-character tabstops, set
       $Text::Wrap::tabstop to the number of characters you do want for your tabstops.

       If you want to separate your lines with something other than "\n" then set $Text::Wrap::separator to your
       preference.  This replaces all newlines with $Text::Wrap::separator.  If you just want to preserve
       existing newlines but add new breaks with something else, set $Text::Wrap::separator2 instead.

       When words that are longer than $columns are encountered, they are broken up.  wrap() adds a "\n" at
       column $columns.  This behavior can be overridden by setting $huge to 'die' or to 'overflow'.  When set
       to 'die', large words will cause die() to be called.  When set to 'overflow', large words will be left
       intact.

       Historical notes: 'die' used to be the default value of $huge.  Now, 'wrap' is the default value.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Code:

         print wrap("\t","",&lt;&lt;END);
         This is a bit of text that forms
         a normal book-style indented paragraph
         END

       Result:

         "     This is a bit of text that forms
         a normal book-style indented paragraph
         "

       Code:

         $Text::Wrap::columns=20;
         $Text::Wrap::separator="|";
         print wrap("","","This is a bit of text that forms a normal book-style paragraph");

       Result:

         "This is a bit of|text that forms a|normal book-style|paragraph"
