</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Locale::Po4a::Text - convert text documents from/to PO files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The po4a (PO for anything) project goal is to ease translations (and more interestingly, the maintenance
       of translations) using gettext tools on areas where they were not expected like documentation.

       Locale::Po4a::Text is a module to help the translation of text documents into other [human] languages.

       Paragraphs are split on empty lines (or lines containing only spaces or tabulations).

       If a paragraph contains a line starting by a space (or tabulation), this paragraph won't be rewrapped.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>ACCEPTED</b> <b>BY</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>MODULE</b></h4><pre>
       These are this module's particular options:

       <b>keyvalue</b>
           Treat paragraphs that look like a colon-separated key-value pair as verbatim (with the "no-wrap" flag
           in  the  PO file). A key-value pair string is a string like "key: value", containing one or more non-
           colon and non-space characters followed by a colon followed  by  at  least  one  non-space  character
           before the end of the line.

       <b>nobullets</b>
           Deactivate the detection of bullets.

           By default, when a bullet is detected, the bullet paragraph is not considered as a verbatim paragraph
           (with  the  "no-wrap"  flag in the PO file). Instead, the corresponding paragraph is rewrapped in the
           translation.

       <b>tabs=</b><u>mode</u>
           Specify how tabulations shall be handled. The <u>mode</u> can be any of:

           <b>split</b>
               Lines with tabulations introduce breaks in the current paragraph.

           <b>verbatim</b>
               Paragraph containing tabulations will not be re-wrapped.

           By default, tabulations are considered as spaces.

       <b>breaks=</b><u>regex</u>
           A regular expression matching lines which introduce breaks.  The regular expression will be  anchored
           so that the whole line must match.

       <b>debianchangelog</b>
           Handle the header and footer of released versions, which only contain non translatable information.

       <b>fortunes</b>
           Handle  the  fortunes  format, which separate fortunes with a line which consists in '%' or '%%', and
           use '%%' as the beginning of a comment.

       <b>markdown</b>
           Handle some special markup in Markdown-formatted texts.

       <b>yfm_keys</b> (markdown-only)
           Comma-separated list of keys to process for translation in the YAML Front Matter section.  All  other
           keys  are  skipped.  Keys are matched with a case-sensitive match. If <b>yfm_paths</b> and <b>yfm_keys</b> are used
           together, values are included if they are matched by at least one of the options.  Array  values  are
           always translated, unless the <b>yfm_skip_array</b> option is provided.

       <b>yfm_lenient</b> (markdown only)
           Allow  the YAML Front Matter parser to fail on malformated headers. This is particularly helpful when
           your file starts with a horizontal ruler instead of a YAML Front Matter,  but  you  insist  on  using
           three dashes only for your ruler.

       <b>yfm_paths</b> (markdown only)
       <b>yfm_paths</b>
           Comma-separated  list  of  hash paths to process for extraction in the YAML Front Matter section, all
           other paths are skipped. Paths are matched with a case-sensitive match. If <b>yfm_paths</b> and <b>yfm_keys</b> are
           used together, values are included if they are matched by at least one of the options.  Arrays values
           are always returned unless the <b>yfm_skip_array</b> option is provided.

       <b>yfm_skip_array</b> (markdown-only)
           Do not translate array values in the YAML Front Matter section.

       <b>control</b>[<b>=</b><u>field_list</u>]
           Handle Debian's control files.  A comma-separated list of fields to be translated can be provided.

       <b>neverwrap</b>
           Prevent po4a from wrapping any lines. This means that every content is handled verbatim, even  simple
           paragraphs.
