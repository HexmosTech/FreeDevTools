       Pod::Text::Termcap - Convert POD data to ASCII text with format escapes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Pod::Text::Termcap;
           my $parser = Pod::Text::Termcap-&gt;new (sentence =&gt; 0, width =&gt; 78);

           # Read POD from STDIN and write to STDOUT.
           $parser-&gt;parse_from_filehandle;

           # Read POD from file.pod and write to file.txt.
           $parser-&gt;parse_from_file ('file.pod', 'file.txt');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Text::Termcap is a simple subclass of Pod::Text that highlights output text using the correct
       termcap escape sequences for the current terminal.  Apart from the format codes, it in all ways functions
       like Pod::Text.  See Pod::Text for details and available options.

       This module uses Term::Cap to find the correct terminal settings.  See the documentation of that module
       for how it finds terminal database information and how to override that behavior if necessary.  If unable
       to find control strings for bold and underscore formatting, that formatting is skipped, resulting in the
       same output as Pod::Text.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Text::Termcap 0.04 (based on Pod::Parser) was the first version of this module included with Perl,
       in Perl 5.6.0.

       The current API based on Pod::Simple was added in Pod::Text::Termcap 2.00.  Pod::Text::Termcap 2.01 was
       included in Perl 5.9.3, the first version of Perl to incorporate those changes.

       Several problems with wrapping and line length were fixed as recently as Pod::Text::Termcap 4.11,
       included in Perl 5.29.1.

       Pod::Text::Termcap 4.13 stopped setting the TERMPATH environment variable during module load.  It also
       stopped falling back on VT100 escape sequences if Term::Cap was not able to find usable escape sequences,
       instead producing unformatted output for better results on dumb terminals.  The next version to be
       incorporated into Perl, 4.14, was included in Perl 5.31.8.

       This module inherits its API and most behavior from Pod::Text, so the details in "COMPATIBILITY" in
       Pod::Text also apply.  Pod::Text and Pod::Text::Termcap have had the same module version since 4.00,
       included in Perl 5.23.7.  (They unfortunately diverge in confusing ways prior to that.)
