</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Name:     <b>height</b>
       Class:    <b>Height</b>
       Switch:   <b>-height</b>
           Specifies  the  desired  height for the window, in units of characters in the font given by the <b>-font</b>
           option.  Must be at least one.

       Name:     <b>spacing1</b>
       Class:    <b>Spacing1</b>
       Switch:   <b>-spacing1</b>
           Requests additional space above each text line in the widget, using any of  the  standard  forms  for
           screen  distances.  If a line wraps, this option only applies to the first line on the display.  This
           option may be overridden with <b>-spacing1</b> options in tags.

       Name:     <b>spacing2</b>
       Class:    <b>Spacing2</b>
       Switch:   <b>-spacing2</b>
           For lines that wrap (so that they cover more than one line on  the  display)  this  option  specifies
           additional  space  to  provide  between  the display lines that represent a single line of text.  The
           value may have any of the standard forms for screen distances.  This option may  be  overridden  with
           <b>-spacing2</b> options in tags.

       Name:     <b>spacing3</b>
       Class:    <b>Spacing3</b>
       Switch:   <b>-spacing3</b>
           Requests  additional  space  below  each text line in the widget, using any of the standard forms for
           screen distances.  If a line wraps, this option only applies to the last line on the  display.   This
           option may be overridden with <b>-spacing3</b> options in tags.

       Name:     <b>state</b>
       Class:    <b>State</b>
       Switch:   <b>-state</b>
           Specifies  one  of  two  states  for  the  text:   <b>normal</b>  or <b>disabled</b>.  If the text is disabled then
           characters may not be inserted or deleted and no insertion cursor will  be  displayed,  even  if  the
           input focus is in the widget.

       Name:     <b>tabs</b>
       Class:    <b>Tabs</b>
       Switch:   <b>-tabs</b>
           Specifies  a  set  of  tab  stops  for  the  window.  The option's value consists of a list of screen
           distances giving the positions of the tab stops.  Each position may optionally  be  followed  in  the
           next  list  element  by  one  of the keywords <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>center</b>, or <b>numeric</b>, which specifies how to
           justify text relative to the tab stop.  <b>Left</b> is the default; it causes the  text  following  the  tab
           character  to  be positioned with its left edge at the tab position.  <b>Right</b> means that the right edge
           of the text following the tab character is positioned at the tab position, and <b>center</b> means that  the
           text is centered at the tab position.  <b>Numeric</b> means that the decimal point in the text is positioned
           at  the tab position;  if there is no decimal point then the least significant digit of the number is
           positioned just to the left of the tab position;  if there is no number in the text then the text  is
           right-justified  at the tab position.  For example, <b>-tabs</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>[qw/2c</b> <b>left</b> <b>4c</b> <b>6c</b> <b>center/]</b> creates three
           tab stops at two-centimeter intervals;  the first two use  left  justification  and  the  third  uses
           center  justification.   If  the  list of tab stops does not have enough elements to cover all of the
           tabs in a text line, then Tk extrapolates new tab stops using the spacing and alignment from the last
           tab stop in the list.  The value of the <b>tabs</b> option may be overridden by <b>-tabs</b> options in  tags.   If
           no  <b>-tabs</b>  option  is  specified,  or  if it is specified as an empty list, then Tk uses default tabs
           spaced every eight (average size) characters.

       Name:     <b>width</b>
       Class:    <b>Width</b>
       Switch:   <b>-width</b>
           Specifies the desired width for the window in units of characters in the  font  given  by  the  <b>-font</b>
           option.   If  the  font doesn't have a uniform width then the width of the character ``0'' is used in
           translating from character units to screen units.

       Name:     <b>wrap</b>
       Class:    <b>Wrap</b>
       Switch:   <b>-wrap</b>
           Specifies how to handle lines in the text that are too long to be displayed in a single line  of  the
           text's  window.  The value must be <b>none</b> or <b>char</b> or <b>word</b>.  A wrap mode of <b>none</b> means that each line of
           text appears as exactly one line on the screen;  extra characters that don't fit on  the  screen  are
           not  displayed.   In the other modes each line of text will be broken up into several screen lines if
           necessary to keep all the characters visible.  In <b>char</b> mode a screen line break may occur  after  any
           character; in <b>word</b> mode a line break will only be made at word boundaries.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>Text</b>  method  creates  a  new  window (given by the $text argument) and makes it into a text widget.
       Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command line or in the  option  database  to
       configure  aspects of the text such as its default background color and relief.  The <b>text</b> command returns
       the path name of the new window.

       A text widget displays one or more lines of text and allows that text to be edited.  Text widgets support
       four different kinds of annotations on the text, called tags, marks, embedded windows or embedded images.
       Tags allow different portions of the text to be displayed with different fonts and colors.  In  addition,
       perl/Tk callbacks can be associated with tags so that scripts are invoked when particular actions such as
       keystrokes  and  mouse  button presses occur in particular ranges of the text.  See "TAGS" below for more
       details.

       The second form of annotation consists of marks, which are floating markers in the text.  Marks are  used
       to  keep  track of various interesting positions in the text as it is edited.  See "MARKS" below for more
       details.

       The third form of annotation allows arbitrary windows to be embedded in a  text  widget.   See  "EMBEDDED
       WINDOWS" below for more details.

       The  fourth  form  of annotation allows Tk images to be embedded in a text widget.  See "EMBEDDED IMAGES"
       below for more details.

       The Perl/Tk <b>Text</b> widget does not support undo/redo, use the <b>TextUndo</b> widget instead.

</pre><h4><b>INDICES</b></h4><pre>
       Many of the methods for texts take one or more indices as arguments.   An  index  is  a  string  used  to
       indicate  a  particular  place  within  a text, such as a place to insert characters or one endpoint of a
       range of characters to delete.  Indices have the syntax

        base modifier modifier modifier ...

       Where <u>base</u> gives a starting point and the <u>modifier</u>s adjust the index from the starting point  (e.g.  move
       forward or backward one character).  Every index must contain a <u>base</u>, but the <u>modifier</u>s are optional.

       The <u>base</u> for an index must have one of the following forms:

       <u>line</u><b>.</b><u>char</u>
           Indicates  <u>char</u>'th character on line <u>line</u>.  Lines are numbered from 1 for consistency with other UNIX
           programs that use this numbering scheme.  Within a line, characters are numbered from 0.  If <u>char</u>  is
           <b>end</b> then it refers to the newline character that ends the line.

       <b>@</b><u>x</u><b>,</b><u>y</u>
           Indicates  the character that covers the pixel whose x and y coordinates within the text's window are
           <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>.

       <b>end</b> Indicates the end of the text (the character just after the last newline).

       <u>mark</u>
           Indicates the character just after the mark whose name is <u>mark</u>.

       <u>tag</u><b>.first</b>
           Indicates the first character in the text that has been tagged with  <u>tag</u>.   This  form  generates  an
           error if no characters are currently tagged with <u>tag</u>.

       <u>tag</u><b>.last</b>
           Indicates the character just after the last one in the text that has been tagged with <u>tag</u>.  This form
           generates an error if no characters are currently tagged with <u>tag</u>.

       <u>$widget</u>
           Indicates the position of the embedded window referenced by <u>$widget</u>.  This form generates an error if
           <u>$widget</u> does not reference to an embedded window.

       <u>imageName</u>
           Indicates  the  position of the embedded image whose name is <u>imageName</u>.  This form generates an error
           if there is no embedded image by the given name.

       If the <u>base</u> could match more than one of the above forms, such as a <u>mark</u> and <u>imageName</u>  both  having  the
       same  value,  then  the  form  earlier  in the above list takes precedence.  If modifiers follow the base
       index, each one of them must have one of the forms listed below.  Keywords such as <b>chars</b> and <b>wordend</b>  may
       be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unambiguous.

       <b>+</b> <u>count</u> <b>chars</b>
           Adjust  the  index  forward  by <u>count</u> characters, moving to later lines in the text if necessary.  If
           there are fewer than <u>count</u> characters in the text after the current index, then set the index to  the
           last character in the text.  Spaces on either side of <u>count</u> are optional.

       <b>-</b> <u>count</u> <b>chars</b>
           Adjust  the index backward by <u>count</u> characters, moving to earlier lines in the text if necessary.  If
           there are fewer than <u>count</u> characters in the text before the current index, then set the index to the
           first character in the text.  Spaces on either side of <u>count</u> are optional.

       <b>+</b> <u>count</u> <b>lines</b>
           Adjust the index forward by <u>count</u> lines, retaining the same character position within the  line.   If
           there  are  fewer than <u>count</u> lines after the line containing the current index, then set the index to
           refer to the same character position on the last line of the text.  Then, if the  line  is  not  long
           enough  to  contain a character at the indicated character position, adjust the character position to
           refer to the last character of the line (the newline).  Spaces on either side of <u>count</u> are optional.

       <b>-</b> <u>count</u> <b>lines</b>
           Adjust the index backward by <u>count</u> lines, retaining the same character position within the line.   If
           there  are fewer than <u>count</u> lines before the line containing the current index, then set the index to
           refer to the same character position on the first line of the text.  Then, if the line  is  not  long
           enough  to  contain a character at the indicated character position, adjust the character position to
           refer to the last character of the line (the newline).  Spaces on either side of <u>count</u> are optional.

       <b>linestart</b>
           Adjust the index to refer to the first character on the line.

       <b>lineend</b>
           Adjust the index to refer to the last character on the line (the newline).

       <b>wordstart</b>
           Adjust the index to refer to the first character of the word containing the current  index.   A  word
           consists  of  any number of adjacent characters that are letters, digits, or underscores, or a single
           character that is not one of these.

       <b>wordend</b>
           Adjust the index to refer to the character just after the last one of the word containing the current
           index.  If the current index refers to the last character of the text then it is not modified.

       If more than one modifier is present then they are applied in  left-to-right  order.   For  example,  the
       index  ``<b>end</b>  <b>-</b> <b>1</b> <b>chars</b>'' refers to the next-to-last character in the text and ``<b>insert</b> <b>wordstart</b> <b>-</b> <b>1</b> <b>c</b>''
       refers to the character just before the first one in the word containing the insertion cursor.

</pre><h4><b>TAGS</b></h4><pre>
       The first form of annotation in text widgets is a tag.  A tag is a textual string that is associated with
       some of the characters in a text.  Tags may contain arbitrary characters, but  it  is  probably  best  to
       avoid  using the the characters `` '' (space), <b>+</b>, or <b>-</b>: these characters have special meaning in indices,
       so tags containing them can't be used as indices.  There may  be  any  number  of  tags  associated  with
       characters in a text.  Each tag may refer to a single character, a range of characters, or several ranges
       of characters.  An individual character may have any number of tags associated with it.

       A  priority  order  is defined among tags, and this order is used in implementing some of the tag-related
       functions described below.  When a tag is defined (by associating  it  with  characters  or  setting  its
       display  options  or  binding callbacks to it), it is given a priority higher than any existing tag.  The
       priority order of tags may be redefined using the ``<u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagRaise</b>'' and ``<u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagLower</b>'' methods.

       Tags serve three purposes in text widgets.  First, they control the way information is displayed  on  the
       screen.   By  default,  characters  are  displayed  as determined by the <b>background</b>, <b>font</b>, and <b>foreground</b>
       options for the text widget.  However, display options may be associated with individual tags  using  the
       ``<u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagConfigure</b>'' method.  If a character has been tagged, then the display options associated with
       the tag override the default display style.  The following options are currently supported for tags:

       <b>-background</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
           <u>Color</u>  specifies the background color to use for characters associated with the tag.  It may have any
           of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.

       <b>-bgstipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
           <u>Bitmap</u> specifies a bitmap that is used as a stipple pattern for the background.  It may have  any  of
           the  forms  accepted  by  <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.  If <u>bitmap</u> hasn't been specified, or if it is specified as an
           empty string, then a solid fill will be used for the background.

       <b>-borderwidth</b> =&gt; <u>pixels</u>
           <u>Pixels</u> specifies the width of a 3-D border to draw around the background.  It may  have  any  of  the
           forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  This option is used in conjunction with the <b>-relief</b> option to give a
           3-D appearance to the background for characters; it is ignored unless the <b>-background</b> option has been
           set for the tag.

       <b>-elide</b> =&gt; boolean
           Elide   specifies whether the data should be elided.  Elided data is not displayed and takes no space
           on screen,  but  further  on behaves just as normal data.

       <b>-data</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
           Allows an arbitrary perl scalar <u>value</u> to be associated with the tag.

       <b>-fgstipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
           <u>Bitmap</u> specifies a bitmap that is used as a stipple pattern when drawing text  and  other  foreground
           information  such  as  underlines.  It may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.  If <u>bitmap</u>
           hasn't been specified, or if it is specified as an empty string, then a solid fill will be used.

       <b>-font</b> =&gt; <u>fontName</u>
           <u>FontName</u> is the name of a font to use for drawing characters.  It may have any of the forms  accepted
           by <b>Tk_GetFontStruct</b>.

       <b>-foreground</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
           <u>Color</u>  specifies  the  color  to  use  when  drawing  text  and  other foreground information such as
           underlines.  It may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.

       <b>-justify</b> =&gt; <u>justify</u>
           If the first character of a display line has a tag for which this option  has  been  specified,  then
           <u>justify</u>  determines  how  to  justify the line.  It must be one of <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, or <b>center</b>.  If a line
           wraps, then the justification for each line on the display is determined by the  first  character  of
           that display line.

       <b>-lmargin1</b> =&gt; <u>pixels</u>
           If the first character of a text line has a tag for which this option has been specified, then <u>pixels</u>
           specifies how much the line should be indented from the left edge of the window.  <u>Pixels</u> may have any
           of the standard forms for screen distances.  If a line of text wraps, this option only applies to the
           first line on the display;  the <b>-lmargin2</b> option controls the indentation for subsequent lines.

       <b>-lmargin2</b> =&gt; <u>pixels</u>
           If  the  first character of a display line has a tag for which this option has been specified, and if
           the display line is not the first for its text line (i.e., the text line has  wrapped),  then  <u>pixels</u>
           specifies how much the line should be indented from the left edge of the window.  <u>Pixels</u> may have any
           of  the  standard forms for screen distances.  This option is only used when wrapping is enabled, and
           it only applies to the second and later display lines for a text line.

       <b>-offset</b> =&gt; <u>pixels</u>
           <u>Pixels</u> specifies an amount by which the text's baseline should be offset vertically from the baseline
           of the overall line, in pixels.  For example, a positive offset can be used for  superscripts  and  a
           negative  offset  can  be  used for subscripts.  <u>Pixels</u> may have any of the standard forms for screen
           distances.

       <b>-overstrike</b> =&gt; <u>boolean</u>
           Specifies whether or not to draw a horizontal rule through the middle  of  characters.   <u>Boolean</u>  may
           have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBoolean</b>.

       <b>-relief</b> =&gt; <u>relief</u>
           <u>Relief</u>  specifies  the  3-D  relief  to  use for drawing backgrounds, in any of the forms accepted by
           <b>Tk_GetRelief</b>.  This option is used in  conjunction  with  the  <b>-borderwidth</b>  option  to  give  a  3-D
           appearance to the background for characters; it is ignored unless the <b>-background</b> option has been set
           for the tag.

       <b>-rmargin</b> =&gt; <u>pixels</u>
           If  the  first  character  of a display line has a tag for which this option has been specified, then
           <u>pixels</u> specifies how wide a margin to leave between the end of the line and the  right  edge  of  the
           window.   <u>Pixels</u>  may  have any of the standard forms for screen distances.  This option is only used
           when wrapping is enabled.  If a text line wraps, the right margin for each line  on  the  display  is
           determined by the first character of that display line.

       <b>-spacing1</b> =&gt; <u>pixels</u>
           <u>Pixels</u>  specifies  how  much  additional  space should be left above each text line, using any of the
           standard forms for screen distances.  If a line wraps, this option only applies to the first line  on
           the display.

       <b>-spacing2</b> =&gt; <u>pixels</u>
           For  lines  that  wrap,  this option specifies how much additional space to leave between the display
           lines for a single text line.  <u>Pixels</u> may have any of the standard forms for screen distances.

       <b>-spacing3</b> =&gt; <u>pixels</u>
           <u>Pixels</u> specifies how much additional space should be left below each text  line,  using  any  of  the
           standard  forms  for screen distances.  If a line wraps, this option only applies to the last line on
           the display.

       <b>-tabs</b> =&gt; <u>tabList</u>
           <u>TabList</u> specifies a set of tab stops in the same form as for the <b>-tabs</b> option for  the  text  widget.
           This option only applies to a display line if it applies to the first character on that display line.
           If this option is specified as an empty string, it cancels the option, leaving it unspecified for the
           tag  (the  default).  If the option is specified as a non-empty string that is an empty list, such as
           <b>-tabs</b> <b>=</b> " "&gt;, then it requests default 8-character tabs as described for the <b>tabs</b> widget option.

       <b>-underline</b> =&gt; <u>boolean</u>
           <u>Boolean</u> specifies whether or not to draw an underline underneath characters.  It may have any of  the
           forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBoolean</b>.

       <b>-wrap</b> =&gt; <u>mode</u>
           <u>Mode</u>  specifies  how  to  handle  lines that are wider than the text's window.  It has the same legal
           values as the <b>-wrap</b> option for the text widget:   <b>none</b>,  <b>char</b>,  or  <b>word</b>.   If  this  tag  option  is
           specified, it overrides the <b>-wrap</b> option for the text widget.

       If  a  character  has  several  tags  associated with it, and if their display options conflict, then the
       options of the highest priority tag are used.  If a particular display option hasn't been specified for a
       particular tag, or if it is specified as an empty string, then that option will never be used;  the next-
       highest-priority tag's option will used instead.  If no tag specifies a particular display  option,  then
       the default style for the widget will be used.

       The  second  purpose  for tags is event bindings.  You can associate bindings with a tag in much the same
       way you can associate bindings with a widget class:  whenever particular X  events  occur  on  characters
       with  the given tag, a given &lt;perl/Tk callback|Tk::callbacks&gt; will be executed.  Tag bindings can be used
       to give behaviors to ranges of characters; among other things, this allows hypertext-like features to  be
       implemented.  For details, see the description of the <b>tagBind</b> widget method below.

       The third use for tags is in managing the selection.  See "THE SELECTION" below.

</pre><h4><b>MARKS</b></h4><pre>
       The  second  form  of  annotation  in  text widgets is a mark.  Marks are used for remembering particular
       places in a text.  They are something like tags, in that they have names and they refer to places in  the
       file, but a mark isn't associated with particular characters.  Instead, a mark is associated with the gap
       between  two characters.  Only a single position may be associated with a mark at any given time.  If the
       characters around a mark are deleted the mark  will  still  remain;   it  will  just  have  new  neighbor
       characters.  In contrast, if the characters containing a tag are deleted then the tag will no longer have
       an  association  with  characters  in  the  file.  Marks may be manipulated with the ``<u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>mark</b>'' text
       widget method, and their current locations may be determined by using  the  mark  name  as  an  index  in
       methods.

       Each  mark  also  has  a  <u>gravity</u>,  which is either <b>left</b> or <b>right</b>.  The gravity for a mark specifies what
       happens to the mark when text is inserted at the point of the mark.  If a mark has left gravity, then the
       mark is treated as if it were attached to the character on its left, so the mark will remain to the  left
       of  any text inserted at the mark position.  If the mark has right gravity, new text inserted at the mark
       position will appear to the right of the mark.  The gravity for a mark defaults to <b>right</b>.

       The name space for marks is different from that for tags:  the same name may be used for both a mark  and
       a tag, but they will refer to different things.

       Two  marks have special significance.  First, the mark <b>insert</b> is associated with the insertion cursor, as
       described under "THE INSERTION CURSOR" below.  Second, the mark <b>current</b> is associated with the  character
       closest  to  the  mouse  and is adjusted automatically to track the mouse position and any changes to the
       text in the widget (one exception:  <b>current</b> is not updated in response to mouse motions if a mouse button
       is down;  the update will be deferred until all mouse buttons have  been  released).   Neither  of  these
       special marks may be deleted.

</pre><h4><b>EMBEDDED</b> <b>WINDOWS</b></h4><pre>
       The  third  form  of  annotation  in text widgets is an embedded window.  Each embedded window annotation
       causes a window to be displayed at a particular point in  the text.  There may be any number of  embedded
       windows  in  a  text widget, and any widget may be used as an embedded window (subject to the usual rules
       for geometry management, which require the text window to be the parent  of  the  embedded  window  or  a
       descendant  of  its parent).  The embedded window's position on the screen will be updated as the text is
       modified or scrolled, and it will be mapped and unmapped as it moves into and out of the visible area  of
       the  text widget.  Each embedded window occupies one character's worth of index space in the text widget,
       and it may be referred to either by the name of its embedded window or by its position  in  the  widget's
       index  space.   If  the  range  of  text  containing  the  embedded  window is deleted then the window is
       destroyed.

       When an embedded window is added to a text widget with the  <b>widgetCreate</b>  method,  several  configuration
       options may be associated with it.  These options may be  modified later with the <b>widgetConfigure</b> method.
       The following options are currently supported:

       <b>-align</b> =&gt; <u>where</u>
           If  the  window is not as tall as the line in which it is displayed, this option determines where the
           window is displayed in the line.  <u>Where</u> must have one of the values <b>top</b> (align the top of the  window
           with the top of the line), <b>center</b> (center the window within the range of the line), <b>bottom</b> (align the
           bottom of the window with the bottom of the line's area), or <b>baseline</b> (align the bottom of the window
           with the baseline of the line).

       <b>-create</b> =&gt; <u>callback</u>
           Specifies  a  callback  that may be evaluated to create the window for the annotation.  If no <b>-window</b>
           option has been specified for the annotation this <u>callback</u> will be evaluated when the  annotation  is
           about to be displayed on the screen.  <u>Callback</u> must create a window for the annotation and return the
           name  of that window as its result.  If the annotation's window should ever be deleted, <u>callback</u> will
           be evaluated again the next time the annotation is displayed.

       <b>-padx</b> =&gt; <u>pixels</u>
           <u>Pixels</u> specifies the amount of extra space to leave on each side of the embedded window.  It may have
           any of the usual forms defined for a screen distance (see <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>).

       <b>-pady</b> =&gt; <u>pixels</u>
           <u>Pixels</u> specifies the amount of extra space to leave on the top and on  the  bottom  of  the  embedded
           window.  It may have any of the usual forms defined for a screen distance (see <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>).

       <b>-stretch</b> =&gt; <u>boolean</u>
           If  the  requested  height  of the embedded window is less than the height of the line in which it is
           displayed, this option can be used to specify whether the window should be  stretched  vertically  to
           fill  its  line.   If the <b>-pady</b> option has been specified as well, then the requested padding will be
           retained even if the window is stretched.

       <b>-window</b> =&gt; <u>$widget</u>
           Specifies the name of a window to display in the annotation.

</pre><h4><b>EMBEDDED</b> <b>IMAGES</b></h4><pre>
       The final form of annotation in text widgets is an embedded image.  Each embedded image annotation causes
       an image to be displayed at a particular point in  the text.  There may be any number of embedded  images
       in a text widget, and a particular image may be embedded in multiple places in the same text widget.  The
       embedded  image's  position  on  the  screen  will  be updated as the text is modified or scrolled.  Each
       embedded image occupies one character's worth of index space in the text widget, and it may  be  referred
       to  either  by  its  position  in  the widget's index space, or the name it is assigned when the image is
       inserted into the text widget with <b>imageCreate</b>.  If the range of text containing the  embedded  image  is
       deleted then that copy of the image is removed from the screen.

       When  an  embedded  image  is  added to a text widget with the <b>image</b> create method, a name unique to this
       instance of the image is returned.  This name may then be used to refer to this image instance.  The name
       is taken to be the value of the <b>-name</b> option (described below).  If the <b>-name</b> option is not provided, the
       <b>-image</b> name is used instead.  If the <u>imageName</u> is already in use in the text widget, then <b>#</b><u>nn</u> is added to
       the end of the <u>imageName</u>, where <u>nn</u> is an arbitrary integer.  This insures the <u>imageName</u> is unique.   Once
       this  name is assigned to this instance of the image, it does not change, even though the <b>-image</b> or <b>-name</b>
       values can be changed with <b>image</b> <b>configure</b>.

       When an embedded image is added to a text widget  with  the  <b>imageCreate</b>  method,  several  configuration
       options  may be associated with it.  These options may be modified later with the <b>image</b> <b>configure</b> method.
       The following options are currently supported:

       <b>-align</b> =&gt; <u>where</u>
           If the image is not as tall as the line in which it is displayed, this option  determines  where  the
           image  is  displayed  in the line.  <u>Where</u> must have one of the values <b>top</b> (align the top of the image
           with the top of the line), <b>center</b> (center the image within the range of the line), <b>bottom</b> (align  the
           bottom  of  the image with the bottom of the line's area), or <b>baseline</b> (align the bottom of the image
           with the baseline of the line).

       <b>-image</b> =&gt; <u>image</u>
           Specifies the name of the Tk image to display in the annotation.  If <u>image</u> is not a valid  Tk  image,
           then an error is returned.

       <b>-name</b> =&gt; <u>ImageName</u>
           Specifies the name by which this image instance may be referenced in the text widget. If <u>ImageName</u> is
           not supplied, then the name of the Tk image is used instead.  If the <u>imageName</u> is already in use, <u>#nn</u>
           is appended to the end of the name as described above.

       <b>-padx</b> =&gt; <u>pixels</u>
           <u>Pixels</u>  specifies the amount of extra space to leave on each side of the embedded image.  It may have
           any of the usual forms defined for a screen distance.

       <b>-pady</b> =&gt; <u>pixels</u>
           <u>Pixels</u> specifies the amount of extra space to leave on the top and on  the  bottom  of  the  embedded
           image.  It may have any of the usual forms defined for a screen distance.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>SELECTION</b></h4><pre>
       Selection  support  is  implemented  via tags.  If the <b>exportSelection</b> option for the text widget is true
       then the <b>sel</b> tag will be associated with the selection:

       [1] Whenever characters are tagged with <b>sel</b> the text widget will claim ownership of the selection.

       [2] Attempts to retrieve the selection will be serviced by the text widget, returning all the  characters
           with the <b>sel</b> tag.

       [3] If the selection is claimed away by another application or by another window within this application,
           then the <b>sel</b> tag will be removed from all characters in the text.

       [4] Whenever the sel tag range changes a virtual event <b>&lt;&lt;Selection</b>&gt;&gt; is generated.

           The  <b>sel</b>  tag  is automatically defined when a text widget is created, and it may not be deleted with
           the  ``<u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagDelete</b>''  method.   Furthermore,  the   <b>selectBackground</b>,   <b>selectBorderWidth</b>,   and
           <b>selectForeground</b>  options  for  the  text  widget  are  tied  to  the  <b>-background</b>, <b>-borderwidth</b>, and
           <b>-foreground</b> options for the <b>sel</b> tag:  changes in either will automatically be reflected in the other.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>INSERTION</b> <b>CURSOR</b></h4><pre>
       The mark named <b>insert</b> has special significance in text widgets.  It is defined automatically when a  text
       widget  is created and it may not be unset with the ``<u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>markUnset</b>'' widget command.  The <b>insert</b> mark
       represents the position of the insertion cursor, and the insertion cursor will automatically be drawn  at
       this point whenever the text widget has the input focus.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>MODIFIED</b> <b>FLAG</b></h4><pre>
       The  text  widget  can keep track of changes to the content of the  widget by means of the modified flag.
       Inserting or deleting text will set this flag. The flag can be queried, set and  cleared  programatically
       as  well.   Whenever   the  flag  changes state a <b>&lt;&lt;Modified</b>&gt;&gt; virtual event is gener- ated. See the edit
       modified widget command for more details.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Text</b> method creates a widget object.  This object supports the <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b>  methods  described
       in  Tk::options  which  can  be  used to enquire and modify the options described above.  The widget also
       inherits all the methods provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.

       The following additional methods are available for text widgets.  In addition, the extended  text  widget
       methods  as  documented  in  <u>"Mastering</u>  <u>Perl/Tk"</u>  are  included  in  this  pod (with permission from the
       publisher, <b>O'Reilly</b> <b>and</b> <b>Associates</b> <b>Inc.</b>).

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>adjustSelect</b>
           Moves the end point of the selection and anchor point to the mouse pointer location.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>bbox</b>(<u>index</u>)
           Returns a list of four elements describing the screen area of the  character  given  by  <u>index</u>.   The
           first  two  elements  of  the  list give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the area
           occupied by the character, and the last two elements give the width and height of the area.   If  the
           character  is  only  partially visible on the screen, then the return value reflects just the visible
           part.  If the character is not visible on the screen then the return value is an empty list.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>clipboardColumnCopy</b>
           Performs a rectangular  copy  of  the  currently  selected  text  with  basic  compensation  for  tab
           characters.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>clipboardColumnCut</b>
           Performs a rectangular cut of the currently selected text with basic compensation for tab characters.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>clipboardColumnPaste</b>
           Performs  a rectangular paste of the text in the clipboard. The upper-left corner is specified by the
           current position of the insert mark with basic compensation for tab characters.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>compare</b>(<u>index1,</u> <u>op,</u> <u>index2</u>)
           Compares the indices given by <u>index1</u> and <u>index2</u> according to the relational operator given by <u>op</u>, and
           returns 1 if the relationship is satisfied and 0 if it isn't.  <u>Op</u> must be one of the operators &lt;, &lt;=,
           ==, &gt;=, &gt;, or !=.  If <u>op</u> is == then 1 is returned if the two indices refer to the same character,  if
           <u>op</u>  is  &lt; then 1 is returned if <u>index1</u> refers to an earlier character in the text than <u>index2</u>, and so
           on.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>Contents</b>(<u>?args</u>?)
           Query or change the entire contents of the text  widget.  If  no  arguments  are  given,  the  entire
           contents of the text widget are returned. If any arguments are given, the entire contents of the text
           widget are deleted and replaced by the argument list.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>debug</b>(?<u>boolean</u>?)
           If  <u>boolean</u>  is  specified,  then  it  must  have  one  of  the  true  or  false  values  accepted by
           Tcl_GetBoolean.  If the value is a true one then internal consistency checks will be turned on in the
           B-tree code associated with text widgets.  If <u>boolean</u> has a false value  then  the  debugging  checks
           will be turned off.  In either case the command returns an empty string.  If <u>boolean</u> is not specified
           then  the  command  returns  <b>on</b> or <b>off</b> to indicate whether or not debugging is turned on.  There is a
           single debugging switch shared by all text widgets:  turning debugging on or off in any widget  turns
           it  on  or  off  for all widgets.  For widgets with large amounts of text, the consistency checks may
           cause a noticeable slow-down.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>delete</b>(<u>index1,</u> ?<u>index2</u>?)
           Delete a range of characters from the text.  If both <u>index1</u> and <u>index2</u> are specified, then delete all
           the characters starting with the one given by <u>index1</u>  and  stopping  just  before  <u>index2</u>  (i.e.  the
           character  at  <u>index2</u>  is  not deleted).  If <u>index2</u> doesn't specify a position later in the text than
           <u>index1</u> then no characters are deleted.  If <u>index2</u> isn't specified then the single character at <u>index1</u>
           is deleted.  It is not allowable to delete characters in a way that would leave the  text  without  a
           newline  as  the  last  character.   The command returns an empty string.  If more indices are given,
           multiple ranges of text will be deleted.  All indices are first checked  for   validity   before  any
           deletions  are  made.  They are sorted and the text is removed from the last range to the first range
           to deleted text does  not cause  a  undesired  index  shifting   side-effects.   If  multiple  ranges
           with  the same start index are  given,  then  the  longest range  is used.  If overlapping ranges are
           given, then they will be merged into spans that do not cause deletion  of  text   outside  the  given
           ranges due to text shifted during deletion.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>deleteSelected</b>
           Delete the currently selected text.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>deleteTextTaggedWith</b>(<u>tag</u>)
           Delete the text tagged with the <u>tag</u> parameter.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>deleteToEndofLine</b>
           Delete from the insert mark location to the end of line.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>dlineinfo</b>(<u>index</u>)
           Returns  a list with five elements describing the area occupied by the display line containing <u>index</u>.
           The first two elements of the list give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the  area
           occupied  by  the  line, the third and fourth elements give the width and height of the area, and the
           fifth element gives the position of the baseline for the line, measured down  from  the  top  of  the
           area.   All of this information is measured in pixels.  If the current wrap mode is <b>none</b> and the line
           extends beyond the boundaries of the window, the area returned reflects the entire area of the  line,
           including the portions that are out of the window.  If the line is shorter than the full width of the
           window  then  the  area returned reflects just the portion of the line that is occupied by characters
           and embedded windows.  If the display line containing <u>index</u> is not visible on  the  screen  then  the
           return value is an empty list.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>dump</b>(?<u>switches</u>?, <u>index1,</u> ?<u>index2</u>?)
           Return  the  contents  of  the text widget from <u>index1</u> up to, but not including <u>index2</u>, including the
           text and information about marks, tags, and embedded windows.  If <u>index2</u> is not  specified,  then  it
           defaults to one character past <u>index1</u>.  The information is returned in the following format:

           <u>key1</u> <u>value1</u> <u>index1</u> <u>key2</u> <u>value2</u> <u>index2</u> ...

           The  possible  <u>key</u>  values  are <b>text</b>, <b>mark</b>, <b>tagon</b>, <b>tagoff</b>, and <u>$text</u>.  The corresponding <u>value</u> is the
           text, mark name, tag name, or window name.  The <u>index</u> information is the index of the  start  of  the
           text,  the  mark,  the  tag  transition,  or  the  window.  One or more of the following switches (or
           abbreviations thereof) may be specified to control the dump:

           <b>-all</b>
               Return information about all elements: text, marks, tags, and windows.  This is the default.

           <b>-command</b> =&gt; <u>callback</u>
               Instead of returning the information as the result of the dump operation, invoke the <u>callback</u>  on
               each  element  of the text widget within the range.  The callback has three arguments appended to
               it before it is evaluated: the <u>key</u>, <u>value</u>, and <u>index</u>.

           <b>-mark</b>
               Include information about marks in the dump results.

           <b>-tag</b>
               Include information about tag transitions in the dump results. Tag  information  is  returned  as
               <b>tagon</b>  and  <b>tagoff</b>  elements  that  indicate  the  begin  and  end  of  each  range  of each tag,
               respectively.

           <b>-text</b>
               Include information about text in the dump results.  The value is the text up to the next element
               or the end of range indicated by <u>index2</u>.  A text element does not span  newlines.   A  multi-line
               block  of  text  that  contains no marks or tag transitions will still be dumped as a set of text
               seqments that each end with a newline.  The newline is part of the value.

           <b>-window</b>

           Include information about embedded windows in the dump results.  The value of  a  window  is  its  Tk
           pathname,  unless the window has not been created yet.  (It must have a create script.)  In this case
           an empty string is returned, and you must query  the  window  by  its  index  position  to  get  more
           information.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>edit</b>(  <u>option,</u> <u>?arg,</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...?</u> );
           This   command  controls the undo mechanism and the modified flag.  The exact behavior of the command
           depends on the option argument that follows the edit argument.  The following forms  of  the  command
           are currently supported:

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>editModified</b>( ?boolean? );
               If  boolean  is  not specified, returns the modified flag of the widget. The insert, delete, edit
               undo and  edit  redo commands  or the user can set or clear the modified  flag.   If  boolean  is
               specified, sets the modified  flag  of  the widget to boolean.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>editRedo</b>;
               (Not  implemented, use <b>TextUndo</b>.)  When the <b>-undo</b> option is true, reapplies the last undone edits
               provided no other edits were done since then. Generates an error when the redo  stack  is  empty.
               Does nothing when the <b>-undo</b> option is false.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>editReset</b>;
               (Not implemented, use <b>TextUndo</b>.) Clears the undo and redo stacks.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>editSeparator</b>;
               (Not  implemented,  use <b>TextUndo</b>.) Inserts a separator (boundary) on the undo stack. Does nothing
               when the -undo option is false.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>editUndo</b>;
               (Not implemented, use <b>TextUndo</b>.) Undoes the last edit action when the -undo option is  true.   An
               edit  action is defined as all the insert and delete commands that are recorded on the undo stack
               in between two separators. Generates an error when the undo stack is empty.   Does  nothing  when
               the -undo option is false.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>FindAll</b>(<u>mode,</u> <u>case,</u> <u>pattern</u>)
           Removes  any  current  selections and then performs a global text search. All matches are tagged with
           the <b>sel</b> tag.

           <u>mode</u> can be be <b>-exact</b> or <b>-regexp</b>. See the <b>search</b> command for more information

           <u>case</u> can be <b>-nocase</b> or <b>-case</b>. See the <b>search</b> command for more information

           <u>pattern</u> is an exact string to match if <u>mode</u> is <b>-exact</b> or a regular expression if the  match  <u>mode</u>  is
           <b>-regexp</b>.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>FindAndReplaceAll</b>(<u>mode,</u> <u>case,</u> <u>find,</u> <u>replace</u>)
           Same  as  the  <b>FindAll</b>  method, however additionally substitutes the matched text with the characters
           <u>replace</u>.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>FindAndReplacePopUp</b>
           Creates a find-and-replace popup window if one  does  not  already  exist.   If  there  is  currently
           selected text, then the 'find' field will be 'pre-filled' with the selection.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>FindNext</b>(<u>direction,</u> <u>mode,</u> <u>case,</u> <u>pattern</u>)
           Removes  any  current  selections and then performs a forward or reverse text search. All matches are
           tagged with the <b>sel</b> tag. <u>direction</u> can be <b>-forwards</b> or <b>-backwards</b>. <u>mode,</u> <u>case</u> and <u>pattern</u> are as  for
           the <b>FindAll</b> method.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>FindPopUp</b>
           Creates a find popup, if one does not yet exist. If there is currently selected text, then the 'find'
           field will be 'pre-filled' with the selection.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>FindSelectionNext</b>
           Gets  the  currently  selected  text  and removes all selections. It then finds the next exact, case-
           sensitive string that matches in a forward direction and selects the text and makes the new selection
           visible.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>FindSelectionPrevious</b>
           Gets the currently selected text and removes all selections. It then  finds  the  next  exact,  case-
           sensitive string that matches in a reverse direction and selects the text and makes the new selection
           visible.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>get</b>(<u>index1,</u> ?<u>index2</u>?)
           Return  a range of characters from the text.  The return value will be all the characters in the text
           starting with the one whose index is <u>index1</u> and ending just before the one whose index is <u>index2</u> (the
           character at <u>index2</u> will not be returned).  If <u>index2</u> is omitted then the single character at  <u>index1</u>
           is  returned.   If there are no characters in the specified range (e.g. <u>index1</u> is past the end of the
           file or <u>index2</u> is less than or equal to <u>index1</u>) then an empty string is returned.  If  the  specified
           range  contains  embedded  windows, no information about them is included in the returned string.  If
           multiple index pairs are given, multiple ranges of text will be returned in a list.   Invalid  ranges
           will  not be represented with empty strings in the list.  The ranges are returned in the order passed
           to <b>get</b>.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>getSelected</b>
           Return the currently selected text.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>GetTextTaggedWith</b>(<u>tag</u>)
           Return the text tagged with the <u>tag</u> parameter.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>GotoLineNumber</b>(<u>line_number</u>)
           Set the insert mark to <u>line_number</u> and ensures the line is visible.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>GotoLineNumberPopUp</b>(<u>line_number</u>)
           Displays a popup, pre-filling it with selected numeric  text  (if  any),  or  the  line  number  from
           <b>GotoLineNumber</b> (if any).

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>image</b>(<u>option</u>, ?<u>arg,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>...</u>?)
       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>image</b><u>Option</u>(?<u>arg,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           This  method is used to manipulate embedded images.  The behavior of the method depends on the <u>option</u>
           argument that follows the <b>image</b> prefix.  The following forms of the methods are currently supported:

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>imageCget</b>(<u>index,</u> <u>option</u>)
                   Returns the value of a configuration option for an  embedded  image.   <u>Index</u>  identifies  the
                   embedded  image, and <u>option</u> specifies a particular configuration option, which must be one of
                   the ones listed in "EMBEDDED IMAGES".

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>imageConfigure</b>(<u>index,</u> ?<u>option,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
                   Query or modify the configuration options for an embedded image.  If no <u>option</u> is  specified,
                   returns  a  list describing all of the available options for the embedded image at <u>index</u> (see
                   Tk::options for information on the format of this list).  If  <u>option</u>  is  specified  with  no
                   <u>value</u>,  then  the  command  returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be
                   identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).   If
                   one  or  more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given option(s)
                   to have the given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty string.  See "EMBEDDED
                   IMAGES" for information on the options that are supported.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>imageCreate</b>(<u>index,</u> ?<u>option,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
                   This command creates a new image annotation, which will appear in the text  at  the  position
                   given  by  <u>index</u>.   Any  number  of  <u>option-value</u>  pairs  may  be  specified to configure the
                   annotation.  Returns a unique identifier that may be used as an index to refer to this image.
                   See "EMBEDDED IMAGES" for information on the options that are supported, and a description of
                   the identifier returned.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>imageNames</b>
                   Returns a list whose elements are the names of all  image  instances  currently  embedded  in
                   $text.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>index</b>(<u>index</u>)
           Returns  the  position corresponding to <u>index</u> in the form <u>line.char</u> where <u>line</u> is the line number and
           <u>char</u> is the character number.  <u>Index</u> may have any of the forms described under "INDICES" above.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>insert</b>(<u>index,</u> <u>chars,</u> ?<u>tagList,</u> <u>chars,</u> <u>tagList,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           Inserts all of the <u>chars</u> arguments just before the character at <u>index</u>.  If <u>index</u> refers to the end of
           the text (the character after the last newline) then the new text is inserted just  before  the  last
           newline  instead.  If there is a single <u>chars</u> argument and no <u>tagList</u>, then the new text will receive
           any tags that are present on both the character before and the character after the  insertion  point;
           if  a tag is present on only one of these characters then it will not be applied to the new text.  If
           <u>tagList</u> is specified then it consists of a list of tag names;  the new characters will receive all of
           the tags in this list and no others, regardless of the tags present around the insertion  point.   If
           multiple  <u>chars</u>-<u>tagList</u>  argument  pairs  are  present, they produce the same effect as if a separate
           <b>insert</b> widget command had been issued for each pair, in order.  The  last  <u>tagList</u>  argument  may  be
           omitted.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>Insert</b>(<u>string</u>)
           Do  NOT  confuse this with the lower-case <b>insert</b> method.  Insert <u>string</u> at the point of the insertion
           cursor. If there is a selection in the text, and it covers the point of the insertion cursor, then it
           deletes the selection before inserting.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>InsertKeypress</b>(<u>character</u>)
           Inserts <u>character</u> at the <b>insert</b> mark. If in overstrike mode, it firsts deletes the character  at  the
           <b>insert</b> mark.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>InsertSelection</b>
           Inserts the current selection at the <b>insert</b> mark.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>insertTab</b>
           Inserts a tab (\t) character at the <b>insert</b> mark.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>mark</b>(<u>option,</u> ?<u>arg,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           This  command  is  used to manipulate marks.  The exact behavior of the command depends on the <u>option</u>
           argument that follows the <b>mark</b> argument.  The following forms of the command are currently supported:

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>markGravity</b>(<u>markName,</u> ?<u>direction</u>?)
                   If <u>direction</u> is not specified, returns <b>left</b> or  <b>right</b>  to  indicate  which  of  its  adjacent
                   characters <u>markName</u> is attached to.  If <u>direction</u> is specified, it must be <b>left</b> or <b>right</b>; the
                   gravity of <u>markName</u> is set to the given value.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>markNames</b>
                   Returns a list whose elements are the names of all the marks that are currently set.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>markNext</b>(<u>index</u>)
                   Returns  the  name  of  the  next mark at or after <u>index</u>.  If <u>index</u> is specified in numerical
                   form, then the search for the next mark begins at that index.  If <u>index</u>  is  the  name  of  a
                   mark,  then  the search for the next mark begins immediately after that mark.  This can still
                   return a mark at the same position if there are multiple marks  at  the  same  index.   These
                   semantics  mean  that  the <b>mark</b> <b>next</b> operation can be used to step through all the marks in a
                   text widget in the same order as the mark information returned by the <b>dump</b> operation.   If  a
                   mark  has  been set to the special <b>end</b> index, then it appears to be <u>after</u> <b>end</b> with respect to
                   the <b>mark</b> <b>next</b> operation.  An empty string is returned if there are no marks after <u>index</u>.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>markPrevious</b>(<u>index</u>)
                   Returns the name of the mark at or before <u>index</u>.  If <u>index</u> is specified  in  numerical  form,
                   then  the  search for the previous mark begins with the character just before that index.  If
                   <u>index</u> is the name of a mark, then the search for the next mark begins immediately before that
                   mark.  This can still return a mark at the same position if there are multiple marks  at  the
                   same  index.   These  semantics  mean  that  the  <b>mark</b> <b>previous</b> operation can be used to step
                   through all the marks in a text widget in the reverse order as the mark information  returned
                   by the <b>dump</b> operation.  An empty string is returned if there are no marks before <u>index</u>.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>markSet</b>(<u>markName,</u> <u>index</u>)
                   Sets  the  mark named <u>markName</u> to a position just before the character at <u>index</u>.  If <u>markName</u>
                   already exists, it is moved from its old position;  if  it  doesn't  exist,  a  new  mark  is
                   created.  This command returns an empty string.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>markUnset</b>(<u>markName</u>?, <u>markName,</u> <u>markName,</u> <u>...</u>?)
                   Remove  the mark corresponding to each of the <u>markName</u> arguments.  The removed marks will not
                   be usable in indices and will not be returned by future calls to ``<u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>markNames</b>''.   This
                   command returns an empty string.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>markExists</b>(<u>markname</u>)
           Returns true if <u>markname</u> exists - false otherwise.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>menu</b>(<u>?menu?</u>)
           If  <u>menu</u>  reference  is  given  as an argument, then the text widget menu is adjusted to use this new
           <u>menu</u>. If the <u>menu</u> argument is <b>undef</b>, then this command disables the current text widget menu.  If the
           <u>menu</u> argument is omitted altogether, then the current text widget menu reference is returned.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>openLine</b>
           Inserts a newline (\n) at the insert mark.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>OverstrikeMode</b>(<u>?boolean?</u>)
           Returns the overstrike mode if <u>boolean</u> is omitted or sets the overstrike mode to <u>boolean</u>. True  means
           overstrike mode is enabled.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>PostPopupMenu</b>(<u>x,y</u>)
           Creates  a  popup  menu  at  the  specified (<u>x,y</u>) pixel coordinates. The default menu has File, Edit,
           Search and View menu items which cascade to sub-menus for further  commands.  There  is  an  implicit
           &lt;Button-3&gt; binding to this method that posts the menu over the cursor.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>ResetAnchor</b>
           Sets the selection anchor to whichever end is farthest from the index argument.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>scan</b>(<u>option</u>, <u>args</u>) or
       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>scan</b><u>option</u>(<u>args</u>)
           This method is used to implement scanning on texts.  It has two forms, depending on <u>option</u>:

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>scanMark</b>(<u>x,</u> <u>y</u>)
                   Records  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u> and the current view in the text window, for use in conjunction with later
                   <b>scanDragto</b> method.  Typically this method is associated with a  mouse  button  press  in  the
                   widget.  It returns an empty string.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>scanDragto</b>(<u>x,</u> <u>y</u>)
                   This  command computes the difference between its <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments and the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments
                   to the last <b>scanMark</b> method for the widget.  It  then  adjusts  the  view  by  10  times  the
                   difference  in coordinates.  This command is typically associated with mouse motion events in
                   the widget, to produce the effect of dragging the text at high speed through the window.  The
                   return value is an empty string.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>search</b>(?<u>switches</u>,? <u>pattern,</u> <u>index,</u> ?<u>stopIndex</u>?)
           Searches the text in <u>$text</u> starting at <u>index</u> for a range of characters that matches  <u>pattern</u>.   If  a
           match  is  found,  the index of the first character in the match is returned as result;  otherwise an
           empty string is returned.  One or more of the following switches (or abbreviations  thereof)  may  be
           specified to control the search:

           <b>-forwards</b>
                   The  search  will proceed forward through the text, finding the first matching range starting
                   at or after the position given by <u>index</u>.  This is the default.

           <b>-backwards</b>
                   The search will proceed backward through the text, finding  the  matching  range  closest  to
                   <u>index</u> whose first character is before <u>index</u>.

           <b>-exact</b>  Use  exact  matching:   the  characters  in  the matching range must be identical to those in
                   <u>pattern</u>.  This is the default.

           <b>-regexp</b> Treat <u>pattern</u> as a regular expression and match it against  the  text  using  the  rules  for
                   regular expressions (see the <b>regexp</b> command for details).

           <b>-nocase</b> Ignore case differences between the pattern and the text.

           <b>-count</b> <u>varName</u>
                   The  argument  following <b>-count</b> gives the name of a variable; if a match is found, the number
                   of characters in the matching range will be stored in the variable.

           <b>-hidden</b> Find hidden text as well. By default only displayed text is found.

           <b>--</b>      This switch has no effect except to terminate the list of switches: the next argument will be
                   treated as <u>pattern</u> even if it starts with <b>-</b>.

       The matching range must be entirely within a single line of text.  For regular  expression  matching  the
       newlines  are  removed  from  the  ends  of  the  lines  before  matching:   use the <b>$</b> feature in regular
       expressions to match the end of a line.  For exact matching the newlines are retained.  If  <u>stopIndex</u>  is
       specified,  the  search stops at that index: for forward searches, no match at or after <u>stopIndex</u> will be
       considered;  for backward searches, no match earlier in the text than <u>stopIndex</u> will be  considered.   If
       <u>stopIndex</u> is omitted, the entire text will be searched: when the beginning or end of the text is reached,
       the  search  continues  at  the  other end until the starting location is reached again;  if <u>stopIndex</u> is
       specified, no wrap-around will occur.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>see</b>(<u>index</u>)
           Adjusts the view in the window so that the character given by <u>index</u> is completely visible.  If  <u>index</u>
           is  already  visible  then  the  command does nothing.  If <u>index</u> is a short distance out of view, the
           command adjusts the view just enough to make <u>index</u> visible at the edge of the window.   If  <u>index</u>  is
           far out of view, then the command centers <u>index</u> in the window.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>selectAll</b>
           Selects all the text in the widget.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>selectLine</b>
           Selects the line with the insert mark.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>selectWord</b>
           Selects the word with the insert mark.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>SetCursor</b>(<u>position</u>)
           Moves the insert mark to <u>position</u>.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tag</b>(<u>option,</u> ?<u>arg,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           This  command  is  used  to manipulate tags.  The exact behavior of the command depends on the <u>option</u>
           argument that follows the <b>tag</b> argument.  The following forms of the command are currently supported:

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagAdd</b>(<u>tagName,</u> <u>index1,</u> ?<u>index2,</u> <u>index1,</u> <u>index2,</u> <u>...</u>?)
                   Associate the tag <u>tagName</u> with all of the characters starting with  <u>index1</u>  and  ending  just
                   before  <u>index2</u>  (the  character  at  <u>index2</u>  isn't tagged).  A single command may contain any
                   number of <u>index1</u>-<u>index2</u> pairs.  If the last <u>index2</u> is omitted then the  single  character  at
                   <u>index1</u> is tagged.  If there are no characters in the specified range (e.g. <u>index1</u> is past the
                   end of the file or <u>index2</u> is less than or equal to <u>index1</u>) then the command has no effect.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagBind</b>(<u>tagName,</u> ?<u>sequence</u>?, ?<u>script</u>?)
                   This  command  associates  <u>script</u> with the tag given by <u>tagName</u>.  Whenever the event sequence
                   given by <u>sequence</u> occurs for a character that has been tagged with <u>tagName</u>, the  script  will
                   be invoked.  This method is similar to the <b>bind</b> command except that it operates on characters
                   in a text rather than entire widgets.  See the Tk::bind documentation for complete details on
                   the  syntax of <u>sequence</u> and the substitutions performed on <u>script</u> before invoking it.  If all
                   arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing any existing binding for the
                   same <u>sequence</u> and <u>tagName</u> (if the first character of <u>script</u> is ``+'' then <u>script</u> augments  an
                   existing  binding  rather  than  replacing  it).   In  this case the return value is an empty
                   string.  If <u>script</u> is omitted then the command returns the <u>script</u> associated with <u>tagName</u> and
                   <u>sequence</u> (an error occurs if there is no such binding).  If  both  <u>script</u>  and  <u>sequence</u>  are
                   omitted  then  the  command  returns a list of all the sequences for which bindings have been
                   defined for <u>tagName</u>.

                   The only events for which bindings may be specified  are  those  related  to  the  mouse  and
                   keyboard  (such as <b>Enter</b>, <b>Leave</b>, <b>ButtonPress</b>, <b>Motion</b>, and <b>KeyPress</b>) or virtual events.  Event
                   bindings for a text widget use the <b>current</b> mark described  under  "MARKS"  above.   An  <b>Enter</b>
                   event  triggers  for a tag when the tag first becomes present on the current character, and a
                   <b>Leave</b> event triggers for a tag when it ceases to be present on the current character.   <b>Enter</b>
                   and <b>Leave</b> events can happen either because the <b>current</b> mark moved or because the character at
                   that  position changed.  Note that these events are different than <b>Enter</b> and <b>Leave</b> events for
                   windows.  Mouse and keyboard events are directed to the  current  character.   If  a  virtual
                   event  is used in a binding, that binding can trigger only if the virtual event is defined by
                   an underlying mouse-related or keyboard-related event.

                   It is possible for the current character to have multiple tags, and for each of them to  have
                   a binding for a particular event sequence.  When this occurs, one binding is invoked for each
                   tag,  in  order  from  lowest-priority  to  highest priority.  If there are multiple matching
                   bindings for  a  single  tag,  then  the  most  specific  binding  is  chosen  (see  the  the
                   documentation  for the <b>bind</b> command for details).  <b>continue</b> and <b>break</b> commands within binding
                   scripts are processed in the same way as for bindings created with the <b>bind</b> command.

                   If bindings are created for the widget as a whole using the <b>bind</b> command, then those bindings
                   will supplement the tag bindings.  The tag  bindings  will  be  invoked  first,  followed  by
                   bindings for the window as a whole.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagCget</b>(<u>tagName,</u> <u>option</u>)
                   This  command  returns  the  current value of the option named <u>option</u> associated with the tag
                   given by <u>tagName</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the <b>tag</b> <b>configure</b> method.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagConfigure</b>(<u>tagName,</u> ?<u>option</u>?, ?<u>value</u>?, ?<u>option,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
                   This command is similar to the <b>configure</b> method except that it  modifies  options  associated
                   with  the  tag given by <u>tagName</u> instead of modifying options for the overall text widget.  If
                   no <u>option</u> is specified, the command returns a list describing all of  the  available  options
                   for  <u>tagName</u>  (see  Tk::options  for  information  on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is
                   specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list  describing  the  one  named  option
                   (this  list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u>
                   is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then  the  command  modifies
                   the  given  option(s) to have the given value(s) in <u>tagName</u>; in this case the command returns
                   an empty string.  See "TAGS" above for details on the options available for tags.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagDelete</b>(<u>tagName,</u> ?<u>tagName,</u> <u>...</u>?)
                   Deletes all tag information for each of the <u>tagName</u> arguments.  The command removes the  tags
                   from  all  characters  in the file and also deletes any other information associated with the
                   tags, such as bindings and display information.  The command returns an empty string.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagLower</b>(<u>tagName</u>?, <u>belowThis</u>?)
                   Changes the priority of tag <u>tagName</u> so that it is just lower in priority than the  tag  whose
                   name  is  <u>belowThis</u>.   If <u>belowThis</u> is omitted, then <u>tagName</u>'s priority is changed to make it
                   lowest priority of all tags.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagNames</b>(?<u>index</u>?)
                   Returns a list whose elements are the names of all the tags that are active at the  character
                   position given by <u>index</u>.  If <u>index</u> is omitted, then the return value will describe all of the
                   tags that exist for the text (this includes all tags that have been named in a ``<u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tag</b>''
                   widget  command  but  haven't  been  deleted  by  a  ``<u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagDelete</b>''  method, even if no
                   characters are currently marked with the tag).  The list will be sorted in order from  lowest
                   priority to highest priority.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagNextrange</b>(<u>tagName,</u> <u>index1,</u> ?<u>index2</u>?)
                   This  command searches the text for a range of characters tagged with <u>tagName</u> where the first
                   character of the range is no earlier than the character at  <u>index1</u>  and  no  later  than  the
                   character just before <u>index2</u> (a range starting at <u>index2</u> will not be considered).  If several
                   matching  ranges  exist,  the  first  one  is  chosen.   The command's return value is a list
                   containing two elements, which are the index of the first character  of  the  range  and  the
                   index  of  the character just after the last one in the range.  If no matching range is found
                   then the return value is an empty string.  If <u>index2</u> is not given then it defaults to the end
                   of the text.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagPrevrange</b>(<u>tagName,</u> <u>index1,</u> ?<u>index2</u>?)
                   This command searches the text for a range of characters tagged with <u>tagName</u> where the  first
                   character of the range is before the character at <u>index1</u> and no earlier than the character at
                   <u>index2</u>  (a  range  starting at <u>index2</u> will be considered).  If several matching ranges exist,
                   the one closest to <u>index1</u> is chosen.  The command's return value is  a  list  containing  two
                   elements,  which  are  the  index  of  the  first character of the range and the index of the
                   character just after the last one in the range.  If no  matching  range  is  found  then  the
                   return value is an empty string.  If <u>index2</u> is not given then it defaults to the beginning of
                   the text.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagRaise</b>(<u>tagName,</u> ?<u>aboveThis</u>?)
                   Changes  the priority of tag <u>tagName</u> so that it is just higher in priority than the tag whose
                   name is <u>aboveThis</u>.  If <u>aboveThis</u> is omitted, then <u>tagName</u>'s priority is changed  to  make  it
                   highest priority of all tags.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagRanges</b>(<u>tagName</u>)
                   Returns  a list describing all of the ranges of text that have been tagged with <u>tagName</u>.  The
                   first two elements of the list describe the first tagged range in  the  text,  the  next  two
                   elements  describe  the second range, and so on.  The first element of each pair contains the
                   index of the first character of the range, and the second element of the  pair  contains  the
                   index  of  the  character  just  after the last one in the range.  If there are no characters
                   tagged with <u>tag</u> then an empty string is returned.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>tagRemove</b>(<u>tagName,</u> <u>index1,</u> ?<u>index2,</u> <u>index1,</u> <u>index2,</u> <u>...</u>?)
                   Remove the tag <u>tagName</u> from all of the characters starting at <u>index1</u> and ending  just  before
                   <u>index2</u>  (the character at <u>index2</u> isn't affected).  A single command may contain any number of
                   <u>index1</u>-<u>index2</u> pairs.  If the last <u>index2</u> is omitted then the single character  at  <u>index1</u>  is
                   tagged.   If  there  are no characters in the specified range (e.g. <u>index1</u> is past the end of
                   the file or <u>index2</u> is less than or equal to <u>index1</u>) then the command  has  no  effect.   This
                   command returns an empty string.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>ToggleInsertMode</b>
           Toggles the current overstrike mode.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>unselectAll</b>
           Unselects all the text in the widget.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>WhatLineNumberPopup</b>
           Creates a popup that displays the current line number of the insert mark.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>widget</b>(<u>option?,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>...</u>?)
       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>widget</b><u>Option</u>(?<u>arg,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           This method is used to manipulate embedded windows.  The behavior of the method depends on the <u>option</u>
           argument  that  follows  the  <b>window</b>  argument.   The  following  forms  of  the method are currently
           supported:

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>windowCget</b>(<u>index,</u> <u>option</u>)
                   Returns the value of a configuration option for an embedded  window.   <u>Index</u>  identifies  the
                   embedded window, and <u>option</u> specifies a particular configuration option, which must be one of
                   the ones listed in "EMBEDDED WINDOWS" above.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>windowConfigure</b>(<u>index</u>?, <u>option,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
                   Query or modify the configuration options for an embedded window.  If no <u>option</u> is specified,
                   returns  a list describing all of the available options for the embedded window at <u>index</u> (see
                   Tk::options for information on the format of this list).  If  <u>option</u>  is  specified  with  no
                   <u>value</u>,  then  the  command  returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be
                   identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).   If
                   one  or  more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given option(s)
                   to have the given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty string.  See "EMBEDDED
                   WINDOWS" above for information on the options that are supported.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>windowCreate</b>(<u>index</u>?, <u>option,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
                   This command creates a new window annotation, which will appear in the text at  the  position
                   given  by  <u>index</u>.   Any  number  of  <u>option-value</u>  pairs  may  be  specified to configure the
                   annotation.  See "EMBEDDED WINDOWS" above for information on the options that are  supported.
                   Returns an empty string.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>windowNames</b>
                   Returns a list whose elements are the names of all windows currently embedded in $text.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>xview</b>(<u>option,</u> <u>args</u>)
           This  command is used to query and change the horizontal position of the text in the widget's window.
           It can take any of the following forms:

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>xview</b>
                   Returns a list containing two elements.  Each element is a real fraction  between  0  and  1;
                   together  they  describe the portion of the document's horizontal span that is visible in the
                   window.  For example, if the first element is .2 and the second element is  .6,  20%  of  the
                   text  is off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the text
                   is off-screen to the right.  The fractions refer only to the lines that are actually  visible
                   in  the  window:   if  the  lines in the window are all very short, so that they are entirely
                   visible, the returned fractions will be 0 and 1, even if there are other lines  in  the  text
                   that  are much wider than the window.  These are the same values passed to scrollbars via the
                   <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>xviewMoveto</b>(<u>fraction</u>)
                   Adjusts the view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the horizontal span of the  text  is  off-
                   screen to the left.  <u>Fraction</u> is a fraction between 0 and 1.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>xviewScroll</b>(<u>number,</u> <u>what</u>)
                   This  command  shifts  the  view  in  the  window left or right according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.
                   <u>Number</u> must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or an abbreviation of  one  of
                   these.   If  <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts left or right by <u>number</u> average-width characters
                   on the display;  if it is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by <u>number</u>  screenfuls.   If  <u>number</u>  is
                   negative  then  characters  farther  to  the  left  become  visible;   if it is positive then
                   characters farther to the right become visible.

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>yview</b>(<u>?args</u>?)
           This command is used to query and change the vertical position of the text in  the  widget's  window.
           It can take any of the following forms:

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>yview</b>
                   Returns  a  list  containing  two elements, both of which are real fractions between 0 and 1.
                   The first element gives the position of the first character in the top line  in  the  window,
                   relative to the text as a whole (0.5 means it is halfway through the text, for example).  The
                   second element gives the position of the character just after the last one in the bottom line
                   of  the  window,  relative  to  the  text  as  a  whole.  These are the same values passed to
                   scrollbars via the <b>-yscrollcommand</b> option.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>yviewMoveto</b>(<u>fraction</u>)
                   Adjusts the view in the window so that the character given by <u>fraction</u>  appears  on  the  top
                   line of the window.  <u>Fraction</u> is a fraction between 0 and 1;  0 indicates the first character
                   in the text, 0.33 indicates the character one-third the way through the text, and so on.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>yviewScroll</b>(<u>number,</u> <u>what</u>)
                   This  command  adjust the view in the window up or down according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.  <u>Number</u>
                   must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b>.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view  adjusts
                   up  or  down  by <u>number</u> lines on the display;  if it is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by <u>number</u>
                   screenfuls.  If <u>number</u> is negative then earlier positions in the text become visible;  if  it
                   is positive then later positions in the text become visible.

           <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>yview</b>(?<b>-pickplace</b>,? <u>index</u>)
                   Changes the view in the <u>$text</u>'s window to make <u>index</u> visible.  If the <b>-pickplace</b> option isn't
                   specified  then  <u>index</u> will appear at the top of the window.  If <b>-pickplace</b> is specified then
                   the widget chooses where <u>index</u> appears in the window:

                   [1]         If <u>index</u> is already visible  somewhere  in  the  window  then  the  command  does
                               nothing.

                   [2]         If  <u>index</u>  is  only  a  few  lines  off-screen  above  the window then it will be
                               positioned at the top of the window.

                   [3]         If <u>index</u> is only a few  lines  off-screen  below  the  window  then  it  will  be
                               positioned at the bottom of the window.

                   [4]         Otherwise, <u>index</u> will be centered in the window.

       The  <b>-pickplace</b>  option has been obsoleted by the <b>see</b> widget command (<b>see</b> handles both x- and y-motion to
       make a location visible, whereas <b>-pickplace</b> only handles motion in y).

       <u>$text</u>-&gt;<b>yview</b>(<u>number</u>)
           This command makes the first character on the line after the one given by <u>number</u> visible at  the  top
           of the window.  <u>Number</u> must be an integer.  This command used to be used for scrolling, but now it is
           obsolete.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk  automatically creates class bindings for texts that give them the following default behavior.  In the
       descriptions below, ``word'' refers to a contiguous group of letters, digits, or ``_'' characters, or any
       single character other than these.

       [1] Clicking mouse button 1 positions the insertion cursor just before the character underneath the mouse
           cursor, sets the input focus to this widget, and clears any selection in the widget.   Dragging  with
           mouse  button  1  strokes  out  a  selection between the insertion cursor and the character under the
           mouse.

       [2] Double-clicking with mouse button 1 selects the word under the  mouse  and  positions  the  insertion
           cursor  at  the  beginning  of  the  word.  Dragging after a double click will stroke out a selection
           consisting of whole words.

       [3] Triple-clicking with mouse button 1 selects the line under the  mouse  and  positions  the  insertion
           cursor  at  the  beginning  of  the  line.  Dragging after a triple click will stroke out a selection
           consisting of whole lines.

       [4] The ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging with mouse button 1  while  the  Shift  key  is
           down;   this  will adjust the end of the selection that was nearest to the mouse cursor when button 1
           was pressed.  If the button is double-clicked before dragging then the selection will be adjusted  in
           units  of whole words;  if it is triple-clicked then the selection will be adjusted in units of whole
           lines.

       [5] Clicking mouse button 1 with the Control key  down  will  reposition  the  insertion  cursor  without
           affecting the selection.

       [6] If any normal printing characters are typed, they are inserted at the point of the insertion cursor.

       [7] The view in the widget can be adjusted by dragging with mouse button 2.  If mouse button 2 is clicked
           without  moving the mouse, the selection is copied into the text at the position of the mouse cursor.
           The Insert key also inserts the selection, but at the position of the insertion cursor.

       [8] If the mouse is dragged out of the widget while button 1 is pressed,  the  entry  will  automatically
           scroll  to  make more text visible (if there is more text off-screen on the side where the mouse left
           the window).

       [9] The Left and Right keys move the insertion cursor one character to the  left  or  right;   they  also
           clear  any  selection  in  the  text.   If  Left  or Right is typed with the Shift key down, then the
           insertion cursor moves and the selection is extended to include the new character.  Control-Left  and
           Control-Right move the insertion cursor by words, and Control-Shift-Left and Control-Shift-Right move
           the insertion cursor by words and also extend the selection.  Control-b and Control-f behave the same
           as  Left  and  Right,  respectively.   Meta-b and Meta-f behave the same as Control-Left and Control-
           Right, respectively.

           The Up and Down keys move the insertion cursor one line up or down and clear  any  selection  in  the
           text.   If  Up  or  Right  is  typed with the Shift key down, then the insertion cursor moves and the
           selection is extended to include the new character.  Control-Up and Control-Down move  the  insertion
           cursor  by  paragraphs  (groups of lines separated by blank lines), and Control-Shift-Up and Control-
           Shift-Down move the insertion cursor by paragraphs and also  extend  the  selection.   Control-p  and
           Control-n behave the same as Up and Down, respectively.

       [11]
           The Next and Prior keys move the insertion cursor forward or backwards by one screenful and clear any
           selection  in  the  text.   If  the  Shift  key  is  held down while Next or Prior is typed, then the
           selection is extended to include the new character.  Control-v moves  the  view  down  one  screenful
           without moving the insertion cursor or adjusting the selection.

       [12]
           Control-Next and Control-Prior scroll the view right or left by one page without moving the insertion
           cursor or affecting the selection.

       [13]
           Home  and Control-a move the insertion cursor to the beginning of its line and clear any selection in
           the widget.  Shift-Home moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the line and also extends  the
           selection to that point.

       [14]
           End  and  Control-e  move  the insertion cursor to the end of the line and clear any selection in the
           widget.  Shift-End moves the cursor to the end of the line and extends the selection to that point.

       [15]
           Control-Home and Meta-&lt; move the insertion cursor  to  the  beginning  of  the  text  and  clear  any
           selection  in the widget.  Control-Shift-Home moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the text
           and also extends the selection to that point.

       [16]
           Control-End and Meta-&gt; move the insertion cursor to the end of the text and clear  any  selection  in
           the  widget.   Control-Shift-End moves the cursor to the end of the text and extends the selection to
           that point.

       [17]
           The Select key and Control-Space set the selection anchor to the position of  the  insertion  cursor.
           They  don't  affect the current selection.  Shift-Select and Control-Shift-Space adjust the selection
           to the current position of the insertion cursor, selecting from the anchor to the insertion cursor if
           there was not any selection previously.

       [18]
           Control-/ selects the entire contents of the widget.

       [19]
           Control-\ clears any selection in the widget.

       [20]
           The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w copies the selection in the widget  to
           the clipboard, if there is a selection.

       [21]
           The  F20  key (labelled Cut on many Sun workstations) or Control-w copies the selection in the widget
           to the clipboard and deletes the selection.  If there is no selection in the widget then  these  keys
           have no effect.

       [22]
           The  F18  key  (labelled  Paste  on  many  Sun workstations) or Control-y inserts the contents of the
           clipboard at the position of the insertion cursor.

       [23]
           The Delete key deletes the selection, if there is one in the widget.  If there is  no  selection,  it
           deletes the character to the right of the insertion cursor.

       [24]
           Backspace  and  Control-h  delete  the  selection,  if  there  is  one in the widget.  If there is no
           selection, they delete the character to the left of the insertion cursor.

       [25]
           Control-d deletes the character to the right of the insertion cursor.

       [26]
           Meta-d deletes the word to the right of the insertion cursor.

       [27]
           Control-k deletes from the insertion cursor to the end of  its  line;  if  the  insertion  cursor  is
           already at the end of a line, then Control-k deletes the newline character.

       [28]
           Control-o  opens a new line by inserting a newline character in front of the insertion cursor without
           moving the insertion cursor.

       [29]
           Meta-backspace and Meta-Delete delete the word to the left of the insertion cursor.

       [30]
           Control-x deletes whatever is selected in the text widget.

       [31]
           Control-t reverses the order of the two characters to the right of the insertion cursor.

       [32]
           Control-z (and Control-underscore on UNIX when tk_strictMotif is true)  undoes  the last edit  action
           if the -undo option is true.  Does nothing otherwise.

       [33]
           Control-Z  (or  Control-y  on  Windows)  reapplies the last undone edit action if the -undo option is
           true. Does nothing otherwise.

       If the widget is disabled using the <b>-state</b> option, then its view can still be adjusted and text can still
       be selected, but no insertion cursor will be displayed and no text modifications will take place.

       The behavior of texts can be changed by defining new bindings for individual widgets or by redefining the
       class bindings.

</pre><h4><b>TIED</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       The Perl/Tk Text widget also has built-in TIEHANDLE methods for <b>print</b> and <b>printf</b> statements.  This  means
       you  can print to file handles tied to a Text widget, and the tied methods automatically insert the print
       statement's arguments into the Text widget.

       For example:

        #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
        use POSIX 'acos';
        use Tk;
        use strict;

        my $mw = MainWindow-&gt;new;
        my $text = $mw-&gt;Text(qw/-width 40 -height 10/)-&gt;pack;

        tie *STDOUT, ref $text, $text;

        print "Hello Text World!\n";
        printf "pi ~= %1.5f", acos(-1.0);

        MainLoop;

       To tie a scrolled Text widget, use the Subwidget method to get to the "real" widget:

        my $text = $mw-&gt;Scrolled('Text')-&gt;pack;
        tie *STDOUT, 'Tk::Text', $text-&gt;Subwidget('scrolled');

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       Text widgets should run efficiently under a variety of conditions.  The text widget uses about 2-3  bytes
       of  main memory for each byte of text, so texts containing a megabyte or more should be practical on most
       workstations.  Text is represented internally with a modified  B-tree  structure  that  makes  operations
       relatively  efficient  even  with  large  texts.  Tags are included in the B-tree structure in a way that
       allows tags to span large ranges or have many disjoint smaller ranges without loss of efficiency.   Marks
       are also implemented in a way that allows large numbers of marks.  In most cases it is fine to have large
       numbers of unique tags, or a tag that has many distinct ranges.

       One  performance  problem can arise if you have hundreds or thousands of different tags that all have the
       following characteristics: the first and last ranges of each tag are near the beginning and  end  of  the
       text,  respectively,  or  a  single  tag  range  covers  most of the text widget.  The cost of adding and
       deleting tags like this is proportional to the number  of  other  tags  with  the  same  properties.   In
       contrast,  there  is  no  problem  with  having  thousands  of  distinct tags if their overall ranges are
       localized and spread uniformly throughout the text.

       Very long text lines can be expensive, especially if they have many marks and tags within them.

       The display line with the insert cursor is redrawn each time the cursor blinks,  which  causes  a  steady
       stream of graphics traffic.  Set the <b>-insertofftime</b> option to 0 avoid this.
