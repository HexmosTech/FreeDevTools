</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Elemental::Paragraph - a paragraph in a Pod document

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.103006

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       This is probably the most important role in the Pod-Elemental distribution.  Classes including this role
       represent paragraphs in a Pod document.  The paragraph is the fundamental unit of dividing up Pod
       documents, so this is a often-included role.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>content</b>
       This is the textual content of the element, as in a Pod::Eventual event.  In other words, this Pod:

         =head2 content

       has a content of "content\n"

   <b>start_line</b>
       This attribute, which may or may not be set, indicates the line in the source document where the element
       began.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>as_pod_string</b>
       This returns the element  as a string, suitable for turning elements back into a document.  Some
       elements, like a "=over" command, will stringify to include extra content like a "=back" command.  In the
       case of elements with children, this method will include the stringified children as well.

   <b>as_debug_string</b>
       This method returns a string, like "as_string", but is meant for getting an overview of the document
       structure, and is not suitable for reproducing a document.  Its exact output is likely to change over
       time.
