       ExtUtils::Constant - generate XS code to import C header constants

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use ExtUtils::Constant qw (WriteConstants);
           WriteConstants(
               NAME =&gt; 'Foo',
               NAMES =&gt; [qw(FOO BAR BAZ)],
           );
           # Generates wrapper code to make the values of the constants FOO BAR BAZ
           #  available to perl

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       ExtUtils::Constant facilitates generating C and XS wrapper code to allow perl modules to AUTOLOAD
       constants defined in C library header files.  It is principally used by the "h2xs" utility, on which this
       code is based.  It doesn't contain the routines to scan header files to extract these constants.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Generally one only needs to call the "WriteConstants" function, and then

           #include "const-c.inc"

       in the C section of "Foo.xs"

           INCLUDE: const-xs.inc

       in the XS section of "Foo.xs".

       For greater flexibility use constant_types(), "C_constant" and "XS_constant", with which "WriteConstants"
       is implemented.

       Currently this module understands the following types. h2xs may only know a subset. The sizes of the
       numeric types are chosen by the "Configure" script at compile time.

       IV  signed integer, at least 32 bits.

       UV  unsigned integer, the same size as <u>IV</u>

       NV  floating point type, probably "double", possibly "long double"

       PV  NUL terminated string, length will be determined with "strlen"

       PVN A  fixed  length  thing,  given  as  a  [pointer, length] pair. If you know the length of a string at
           compile time you may use this instead of <u>PV</u>

       SV  A <b>mortal</b> SV.

       YES Truth.  ("PL_sv_yes")  The value is not needed (and ignored).

       NO  Defined Falsehood.  ("PL_sv_no")  The value is not needed (and ignored).

       UNDEF
           "undef".  The value of the macro is not needed.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       constant_types
           A function returning a single scalar with "#define" definitions for  the  constants  used  internally
           between the generated C and XS functions.

       XS_constant PACKAGE, TYPES, XS_SUBNAME, C_SUBNAME
           A  function  to  generate  the  XS  code  to  implement the perl subroutine <u>PACKAGE</u>::constant used by
           <u>PACKAGE</u>::AUTOLOAD to load constants.  This XS code  is  a  wrapper  around  a  C  subroutine  usually
           generated by "C_constant", and usually named "constant".

           <u>TYPES</u> should be given either as a comma separated list of types that the C subroutine "constant" will
           generate  or as a reference to a hash. It should be the same list of types as "C_constant" was given.
           [Otherwise "XS_constant" and "C_constant" may have different ideas about  the  number  of  parameters
           passed to the C function "constant"]

           You  can  call  the perl visible subroutine something other than "constant" if you give the parameter
           <u>XS_SUBNAME</u>. The C subroutine it calls defaults to the name of the perl visible subroutine, unless you
           give the parameter <u>C_SUBNAME</u>.

       autoload PACKAGE, VERSION, AUTOLOADER
           A function to generate the AUTOLOAD subroutine for the module <u>PACKAGE</u> <u>VERSION</u> is the perl version the
           code should be backwards compatible with.  It defaults to the version of perl running the subroutine.
           If <u>AUTOLOADER</u> is true, the AUTOLOAD subroutine falls back on AutoLoader::AUTOLOAD for all names  that
           the <b>constant()</b> routine doesn't recognise.

       WriteMakefileSnippet
           WriteMakefileSnippet ATTRIBUTE =&gt; VALUE [, ...]

           A  function  to  generate  perl  code  for Makefile.PL that will regenerate the constant subroutines.
           Parameters are named as passed to "WriteConstants", with the addition  of  "INDENT"  to  specify  the
           number of leading spaces (default 2).

           Currently only "INDENT", "NAME", "DEFAULT_TYPE", "NAMES", "C_FILE" and "XS_FILE" are recognised.

       WriteConstants ATTRIBUTE =&gt; VALUE [, ...]
           Writes  a file of C code and a file of XS code which you should "#include" and "INCLUDE" in the C and
           XS sections respectively  of  your  module's  XS  code.   You  probably  want  to  do  this  in  your
           "Makefile.PL",  so  that  you can easily edit the list of constants without touching the rest of your
           module.  The attributes supported are

           NAME
               Name of the module.  This must be specified

           DEFAULT_TYPE
               The default type for the constants.  If not specified "IV" is assumed.

           BREAKOUT_AT
               The names of the constants are grouped by length.  Generate child subroutines for each group with
               this number or more names in.

           NAMES
               An array of constants' names, either  scalars  containing  names,  or  hashrefs  as  detailed  in
               "C_constant".

           PROXYSUBS
               If true, uses proxy subs. See ExtUtils::Constant::ProxySubs.

           C_FH
               A filehandle to write the C code to.  If not given, then <u>C_FILE</u> is opened for writing.

           C_FILE
               The  name  of the file to write containing the C code.  The default is "const-c.inc".  The "-" in
               the name ensures that the file can't be mistaken  for  anything  related  to  a  legitimate  perl
               package  name, and not naming the file ".c" avoids having to override Makefile.PL's ".xs" to ".c"
               rules.

           XS_FH
               A filehandle to write the XS code to.  If not given, then <u>XS_FILE</u> is opened for writing.

           XS_FILE
               The name of the file to write containing the XS code.  The default is "const-xs.inc".

           XS_SUBNAME
               The perl visible name of the XS subroutine generated which will return the constants. The default
               is "constant".

           C_SUBNAME
               The name of the C  subroutine  generated  which  will  return  the  constants.   The  default  is
               <u>XS_SUBNAME</u>.   Child  subroutines  have  "_"  and  the  name length appended, so constants with 10
               character names would be in "constant_10" with the default <u>XS_SUBNAME</u>.
