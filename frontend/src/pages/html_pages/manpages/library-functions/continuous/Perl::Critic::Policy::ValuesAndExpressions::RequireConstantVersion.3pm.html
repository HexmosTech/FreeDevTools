</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::RequireConstantVersion - Require $VERSION to be a constant
       rather than a computed value.

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is part of the core Perl::Critic distribution.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The $VERSION variable of a module should be a simple constant - either a number, a single-quotish string,
       or a 'use version' object. In the latter case the 'use version;' must appear on the same line as the
       object construction.

       Computing the version has problems of various severities.

       The most benign violation is computing the version from (e.g.) a Subversion revision number:

           our ($VERSION) = q$REVISION: 42$ =~ /(\d+)/;

       The problem here is that the version is tied to a single repository. The code can not be moved to another
       repository (even of the same type) without changing its version, possibly in the wrong direction.

       This policy accepts v-strings ("v1.2.3" or just plain 1.2.3), since these are already flagged by
       Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitVersionStrings.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The proper way to set a module's $VERSION to a "version" object is to "use version;" on the same line of
       code that assigns the value of $VERSION.  That way, ExtUtils::MakeMaker and Module::Build can extract the
       version when packaging the module for CPAN. By default, this policy declares an error if this is not
       done.

       Should you wish to allow version objects without loading the version module on the same line, add the
       following to your configuration file:

           [ValuesAndExpressions::RequireConstantVersion]
           allow_version_without_use_on_same_line = 1

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       There will be false negatives if the $VERSION appears on the left-hand side of a list assignment that
       assigns to more than one variable, or to "undef".

       There may be false positives if the $VERSION is assigned the value of a here document. This will probably
       remain the case until PPI::Token::HereDoc acquires the relevant portions of the PPI::Token::Quote
       interface.

       There will be false positives if $VERSION is assigned the value of a constant created by the Readonly
       module or the constant pragma, because the necessary infrastructure appears not to exist, and the author
       of the present module lacked the knowledge/expertise/gumption to put it in place.

       Currently the idiom

           our $VERSION = '1.005_05';
           $VERSION = eval $VERSION;

       will produce a violation on the second line of the example.
