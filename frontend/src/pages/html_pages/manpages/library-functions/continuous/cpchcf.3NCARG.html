</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPCHCF - Called by Conpack routines when a constant field is detected.  The default version does nothing.
       A user-written version may be supplied to provide control as the constant-field message is drawn.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL CPCHCF (IFLG)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       IFLG        (INTEGER,  input)  is  positive  if an action is about to be taken, negative if an action has
                   just been completed.  The action in question is defined by the absolute  value  of  IFLG,  as
                   follows:

                   •   The  value  1  implies  the determination of the size of the label (by means of a call to
                       PLCHHQ, in the package Plotchar, with ANGD=360.).

                   •   The value 2 implies the filling of the box around the label, which  is  done  before  the
                       drawing of the label itself.

                   •   The  value  3  implies  the  drawing  of  the label (by means of a call to PLCHHQ, in the
                       package Plotchar).

                   •   The value 4 implies the drawing of the box around the label,  which  is  done  after  the
                       drawing of the label itself.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  routine  CPCHCF  is  not  to  be  called  by the user. It is called several times by Conpack while a
       constant-field label is being drawn.  The  default  version  of  CPCHCF  does  nothing.  A  user-supplied
       replacement may change attributes such as color and line width (by calling the SPPS routine SETUSV or the
       appropriate  GKS  routines).  The  text  of  the label being written may be retrieved by means of a "CALL
       CPGETC ('CTM',CVAL)". The text of the label may be changed by means of a "CALL CPSETC ('CTM',CVAL)"; this
       should only be done during a call with IFLG = 1 or 3 and, if it is done for one of those two  values,  it
       should  also  be done for the other. When CPCHCF is called, the parameter 'ZDV' will have been set to the
       value of the field; its value may be retrieved and used by CPCHCF.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use CPCHCF, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in that order.
