       Perl::Critic::Policy::Compatibility::Gtk2Constants - new enough Gtk2 version for its constants

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy is part of the "Perl::Critic::Pulp" add-on.  It requires that if you use certain constant
       subs from "Gtk2" and "Glib" then you must explicitly have a "use" of a high enough version of those
       modules.

           use Gtk2 1.160;
           ... return Gtk2::EVENT_PROPAGATE;  # bad

           use Gtk2 1.200 ':constants';
           ... return GDK_CURRENT_TIME;       # good

       The following "Gtk2" constants are checked,

           GTK_PRIORITY_RESIZE       # new in Gtk2 1.200 (devel 1.190)
           GDK_PRIORITY_EVENTS
           GDK_PRIORITY_REDRAW
           GDK_CURRENT_TIME

           EVENT_PROPAGATE           # new in Gtk2 1.220 (devel 1.210)
           EVENT_STOP

           GTK_PATH_PRIO_LOWEST      # new in Gtk2 1.220 (devel 1.211)
           GTK_PATH_PRIO_GTK
           GTK_PATH_PRIO_APPLICATION
           GTK_PATH_PRIO_THEME
           GTK_PATH_PRIO_RC
           GTK_PATH_PRIO_HIGHEST

       and the following "Glib" constants

           SOURCE_CONTINUE           # new in Glib 1.220 (devel 1.210)
           SOURCE_REMOVE

       The idea is to keep you from using the constants without a new enough "Gtk2" or "Glib".  Of course
       there's a huge number of other things you might do that also require a new enough version, but these
       constants tripped me up a few times.

       The exact version numbers above and demanded are development versions.  You're probably best off rounding
       up to a "stable" one like 1.200 or 1.220.

       As always if you don't care about this and in particular if for instance you only ever use Gtk2 1.220 or
       higher anyway then you can disable "Gtk2Constants" from your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> in the usual way (see
       "CONFIGURATION" in Perl::Critic),

           [-Compatibility::Gtk2Constants]

   <b>Constant</b> <b>Forms</b>
       Constants are recognised as any of for instance

           EVENT_PROPAGATE
           Gtk2::EVENT_PROPAGATE
           Gtk2-&gt;EVENT_PROPAGATE
           &amp;EVENT_PROPAGATE
           &amp;Gtk2::EVENT_PROPAGATE

       When there's a class name given it's checked, so that other uses of say "EVENT_PROPAGATE" aren't picked
       up.

           Some::Other::Thing::EVENT_PROPAGATE      # ok
           Some::Other::Thing-&gt;EVENT_PROPAGATE      # ok
           &amp;Some::Other::Thing::EVENT_PROPAGATE     # ok

       When there's no class name, then it's only assumed to be Gtk2 or Glib when the respective module has been
       included.

           use Something::Else;
           EVENT_PROPAGATE           # ok

           use Gtk2 ':constants';
           EVENT_PROPAGATE           # bad

       In the latter form there's no check for ":constants" or explicit import in the "use", it's assumed that
       if you've used Gtk2 then "EVENT_PROPAGATE" means that one no matter how the imports might be arranged.
