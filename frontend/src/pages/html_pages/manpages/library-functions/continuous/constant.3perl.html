       constant - Perl pragma to declare constants

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use constant PI    =&gt; 4 * atan2(1, 1);
           use constant DEBUG =&gt; 0;

           print "Pi equals ", PI, "...\n" if DEBUG;

           use constant {
               SEC   =&gt; 0,
               MIN   =&gt; 1,
               HOUR  =&gt; 2,
               MDAY  =&gt; 3,
               MON   =&gt; 4,
               YEAR  =&gt; 5,
               WDAY  =&gt; 6,
               YDAY  =&gt; 7,
               ISDST =&gt; 8,
           };

           use constant WEEKDAYS =&gt; qw(
               Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
           );

           print "Today is ", (WEEKDAYS)[ (localtime)[WDAY] ], ".\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This pragma allows you to declare constants at compile-time.

       When you declare a constant such as "PI" using the method shown above, each machine your script runs upon
       can have as many digits of accuracy as it can use.  Also, your program will be easier to read, more
       likely to be maintained (and maintained correctly), and far less likely to send a space probe to the
       wrong planet because nobody noticed the one equation in which you wrote 3.14195.

       When a constant is used in an expression, Perl replaces it with its value at compile time, and may then
       optimize the expression further.  In particular, any code in an "if (CONSTANT)" block will be optimized
       away if the constant is false.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       As with all "use" directives, defining a constant happens at compile time.  Thus, it's probably not
       correct to put a constant declaration inside of a conditional statement (like "if ($foo) { use constant
       ... }").

       Constants defined using this module cannot be interpolated into strings like variables.  However,
       concatenation works just fine:

           print "Pi equals PI...\n";        # WRONG: does not expand "PI"
           print "Pi equals ".PI."...\n";    # right

       Even though a reference may be declared as a constant, the reference may point to data which may be
       changed, as this code shows.

           use constant ARRAY =&gt; [ 1,2,3,4 ];
           print ARRAY-&gt;[1];
           ARRAY-&gt;[1] = " be changed";
           print ARRAY-&gt;[1];

       Constants belong to the package they are defined in.  To refer to a constant defined in another package,
       specify the full package name, as in "Some::Package::CONSTANT".  Constants may be exported by modules,
       and may also be called as either class or instance methods, that is, as "Some::Package-&gt;CONSTANT" or as
       "$obj-&gt;CONSTANT" where $obj is an instance of "Some::Package".  Subclasses may define their own constants
       to override those in their base class.

       As of version 1.32 of this module, constants can be defined in packages other than the caller, by
       including the package name in the name of the constant:

           use constant "OtherPackage::FWIBBLE" =&gt; 7865;
           constant-&gt;import("Other::FWOBBLE",$value); # dynamically at run time

       The use of all caps for constant names is merely a convention, although it is recommended in order to
       make constants stand out and to help avoid collisions with other barewords, keywords, and subroutine
       names.  Constant names must begin with a letter or underscore.  Names beginning with a double underscore
       are reserved.  Some poor choices for names will generate warnings, if warnings are enabled at compile
       time.

   <b>List</b> <b>constants</b>
       Constants may be lists of more (or less) than one value.  A constant with no values evaluates to "undef"
       in scalar context.  Note that constants with more than one value do <u>not</u> return their last value in scalar
       context as one might expect.  They currently return the number of values, but <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b>
       <b>future</b>.  Do not use constants with multiple values in scalar context.

       <b>NOTE:</b> This implies that the expression defining the value of a constant is evaluated in list context.
       This may produce surprises:

           use constant TIMESTAMP =&gt; localtime;                # WRONG!
           use constant TIMESTAMP =&gt; scalar localtime;         # right

       The first line above defines "TIMESTAMP" as a 9-element list, as returned by localtime() in list context.
       To set it to the string returned by localtime() in scalar context, an explicit "scalar" keyword is
       required.

       List constants are lists, not arrays.  To index or slice them, they must be placed in parentheses.

           my @workdays = WEEKDAYS[1 .. 5];            # WRONG!
           my @workdays = (WEEKDAYS)[1 .. 5];          # right

   <b>Defining</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>constants</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b>
       Instead of writing multiple "use constant" statements, you may define multiple constants in a single
       statement by giving, instead of the constant name, a reference to a hash where the keys are the names of
       the constants to be defined.  Obviously, all constants defined using this method must have a single
       value.

           use constant {
               FOO =&gt; "A single value",
               BAR =&gt; "This", "won't", "work!",        # Error!
           };

       This is a fundamental limitation of the way hashes are constructed in Perl.  The error messages produced
       when this happens will often be quite cryptic -- in the worst case there may be none at all, and you'll
       only later find that something is broken.

       When defining multiple constants, you cannot use the values of other constants defined in the same
       declaration.  This is because the calling package doesn't know about any constant within that group until
       <u>after</u> the "use" statement is finished.

           use constant {
               BITMASK =&gt; 0xAFBAEBA8,
               NEGMASK =&gt; ~BITMASK,                    # Error!
           };

   <b>Magic</b> <b>constants</b>
       Magical values and references can be made into constants at compile time, allowing for way cool stuff
       like this.  (These error numbers aren't totally portable, alas.)

           use constant E2BIG =&gt; ($! = 7);
           print   E2BIG, "\n";        # something like "Arg list too long"
           print 0+E2BIG, "\n";        # "7"

       You can't produce a tied constant by giving a tied scalar as the value.  References to tied variables,
       however, can be used as constants without any problems.

</pre><h4><b>TECHNICAL</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       In the current implementation, scalar constants are actually inlinable subroutines.  As of version 5.004
       of Perl, the appropriate scalar constant is inserted directly in place of some subroutine calls, thereby
       saving the overhead of a subroutine call.  See "Constant Functions" in perlsub for details about how and
       when this happens.

       In the rare case in which you need to discover at run time whether a particular constant has been
       declared via this module, you may use this function to examine the hash %constant::declared.  If the
       given constant name does not include a package name, the current package is used.

           sub declared ($) {
               use constant 1.01;              # don't omit this!
               my $name = shift;
               $name =~ s/^::/main::/;
               my $pkg = caller;
               my $full_name = $name =~ /::/ ? $name : "${pkg}::$name";
               $constant::declared{$full_name};
           }

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       List constants are not inlined unless you are using Perl v5.20 or higher.  In v5.20 or higher, they are
       still not read-only, but that may change in future versions.

       It is not possible to have a subroutine or a keyword with the same name as a constant in the same
       package.  This is probably a Good Thing.

       A constant with a name in the list "STDIN STDOUT STDERR ARGV ARGVOUT ENV INC SIG" is not allowed anywhere
       but in package "main::", for technical reasons.

       Unlike constants in some languages, these cannot be overridden on the command line or via environment
       variables.

       You can get into trouble if you use constants in a context which automatically quotes barewords (as is
       true for any subroutine call).  For example, you can't say $hash{CONSTANT} because "CONSTANT" will be
       interpreted as a string.  Use $hash{CONSTANT()} or $hash{+CONSTANT} to prevent the bareword quoting
       mechanism from kicking in.  Similarly, since the "=&gt;" operator quotes a bareword immediately to its left,
       you have to say "CONSTANT() =&gt; 'value'" (or simply use a comma in place of the big arrow) instead of
       "CONSTANT =&gt; 'value'".
