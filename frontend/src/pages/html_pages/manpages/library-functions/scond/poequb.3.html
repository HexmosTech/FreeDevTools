       <b>CPOEQUB</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CPOEQUB computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a
            Hermitian positive definite matrix A and reduce its condition number
            (with respect to the two-norm).  S contains the scale factors,
            S(i) = 1/sqrt(A(i,i)), chosen so that the scaled matrix B with
            elements B(i,j) = S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has ones on the diagonal.  This
            choice of S puts the condition number of B within a factor N of the
            smallest possible condition number over all possible diagonal
            scalings.

            This routine differs from CPOEQU by restricting the scaling factors
            to a power of the radix.  Barring over- and underflow, scaling by
            these factors introduces no additional rounding errors.  However, the
            scaled diagonal entries are no longer approximately 1 but lie
            between sqrt(radix) and 1/sqrt(radix).

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                     The order of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     The N-by-N Hermitian positive definite matrix whose scaling
                     factors are to be computed.  Only the diagonal elements of A
                     are referenced.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>S</u>

                     S is REAL array, dimension (N)
                     If INFO = 0, S contains the scale factors for A.

           <u>SCOND</u>

                     SCOND is REAL
                     If INFO = 0, S contains the ratio of the smallest S(i) to
                     the largest S(i).  If SCOND &gt;= 0.1 and AMAX is neither too
                     large nor too small, it is not worth scaling by S.

           <u>AMAX</u>

                     AMAX is REAL
                     Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
                     close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
                     should be scaled.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit
                     &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
                     &gt; 0:  if INFO = i, the i-th diagonal element is nonpositive.

       <b>DPOEQUB</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            symmetric positive definite matrix A and reduce its condition number

            S(i) = 1/sqrt(A(i,i)), chosen so that the scaled matrix B with
            elements B(i,j) = S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has ones on the diagonal.  This
            choice of S puts the condition number of B within a factor N of the
