       Smokeping::matchers::ConsecutiveLoss - Raise/clear alerts according to your choice of threshold and
       consecutive values

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Use this matcher to raise and clear alerts according to your choice of threshold and consecutive values.
       As an example, you can raise an alert on first occurrence of 50% packet loss, but choose to hold the
       alert active until packet loss stays below 10% for 5 consecutive measurements.

       Add the matcher to your config file using below syntax:

        type = matcher
        edgetrigger = yes
        pattern =  ConsecutiveLoss(pctlossraise=&gt;##,stepsraise=&gt;##,pctlossclear=&gt;##,stepsclear=&gt;##)

       Replace the ## with integers of your choice, see below for reference:

       pctlossraise - Loss values at or above this percentage will raise an alert when...  stepsraise - ...
       number of consecutive values have been collected

       pctlossclear - Loss values below this percentage will clear an alert when...  stepsclear - ... number of
       consecutive values have been collected

       In my environment, I define four alerts for levels like:

        +packetloss_significant_instantalert
        type = matcher
        pattern = ConsecutiveLoss(pctlossraise=&gt;10,stepsraise=&gt;1,pctlossclear=&gt;3,stepsclear=&gt;3)
        comment = Instant alert - Significant packet loss detected (At least 10% over 1 cycle). Alert will clear when loss stays at max 2% for 3 cycles
        priority = 30

        +packetloss_major_instantalert
        type = matcher
        pattern = ConsecutiveLoss(pctlossraise=&gt;25,stepsraise=&gt;1,pctlossclear=&gt;3,stepsclear=&gt;3)
        comment = Instant alert - Major packet loss detected (At least 25% over 1 cycle). Alert will clear when loss stays at max 2% for 3 cycles
        priority = 20

        +packetloss_significant_consecutivealert
        type = matcher
        pattern = ConsecutiveLoss(pctlossraise=&gt;10,stepsraise=&gt;3,pctlossclear=&gt;3,stepsclear=&gt;5)
        comment = Consecutive occurrence of significant packet loss detected (At least 10% over 3 cycles). Alert will clear when loss stays at max 2% for 5 cycles.
        priority = 10

        +packetloss_major_consecutivealert
        type = matcher
        pattern = ConsecutiveLoss(pctlossraise=&gt;25,stepsraise=&gt;3,pctlossclear=&gt;3,stepsclear=&gt;5)
        comment = Consecutive occurrence of significant packet loss detected (At least 25% over 3 cycles). Alert will clear when loss stays at max 2% for 5 cycles.
        priority = 5
