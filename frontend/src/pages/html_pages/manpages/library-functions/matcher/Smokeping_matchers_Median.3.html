       Smokeping::matchers::Median - Find persistent changes in latency

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       The idea behind this matcher is to find sustained changes in latency.

       The median matcher takes a number of past median latencies. It splits the latencies into two groups (old
       and new) and again finds the median for each groups. If the difference between the two medians is bigger
       than a certain value, it will give a match.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Call the matcher with the following sequence:

        type = matcher
        pattern =  Median(old=&gt;x,new=&gt;y,diff=&gt;z)

       This will create a matcher which consumes x+y latency-datapoints, builds the two medians and the matches
       if the difference between the median latency is larger than z seconds.
