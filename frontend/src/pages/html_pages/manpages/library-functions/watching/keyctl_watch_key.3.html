</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       keyctl_watch_key - Watch for changes to a key

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;keyutils.h&gt;</b>

       <b>long</b> <b>keyctl_watch_key(key_serial_t</b> <u>key</u><b>,</b>
                             <b>int</b> <u>watch_queue_fd</u>
                             <b>int</b> <u>watch_id</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>keyctl_watch_key</b>() sets or removes a watch on <u>key</u>.

       <u>watch_id</u>  specifies the ID for a watch that will be included in notification messages.  It can be between
       0 and 255 to add a key; it should be -1 to remove a key.

       <u>watch_queue_fd</u> is a file descriptor attached to a watch_queue device instance.  Multiple  openings  of  a
       device provide separate instances.  Each device instance can only have one watch on any particular key.

   <b>Notification</b> <b>Record</b>
       Key-specific notification messages that the kernel emits into the buffer have the following format:

           struct key_notification {
                struct watch_notification watch;
                __u32     key_id;
                __u32     aux;
           };

       The <u>watch.type</u> field will be set to <b>WATCH_TYPE_KEY_NOTIFY</b> and the <u>watch.subtype</u> field will contain one of
       the following constants, indicating the event that occurred and the watch_id passed to keyctl_watch_key()
       will be placed in <u>watch.info</u> in the ID field.  The following events are defined:

       <b>NOTIFY_KEY_INSTANTIATED</b>
              This  indicates  that a watched key got instantiated or negatively instantiated.  <u>key_id</u> indicates
              the key that was instantiated and <u>aux</u> is unused.

       <b>NOTIFY_KEY_UPDATED</b>
              This indicates that a watched key got updated or instantiated by update.  <u>key_id</u> indicates the key
              that was updated and <u>aux</u> is unused.

       <b>NOTIFY_KEY_LINKED</b>
              This indicates that a key got linked into a watched keyring.  <u>key_id</u> indicates  the  keyring  that
              was modified <u>aux</u> indicates the key that was added.

       <b>NOTIFY_KEY_UNLINKED</b>
              This  indicates that a key got unlinked from a watched keyring.  <u>key_id</u> indicates the keyring that
              was modified <u>aux</u> indicates the key that was removed.

       <b>NOTIFY_KEY_CLEARED</b>
              This indicates that a watched keyring got cleared.  <u>key_id</u> indicates the keyring that was  cleared
              and <u>aux</u> is unused.

       <b>NOTIFY_KEY_REVOKED</b>
              This  indicates that a watched key got revoked.  <u>key_id</u> indicates the key that was revoked and <u>aux</u>
              is unused.

       <b>NOTIFY_KEY_INVALIDATED</b>
              This indicates that a watched key got invalidated.  <u>key_id</u> indicates the key that was  invalidated
              and <u>aux</u> is unused.

       <b>NOTIFY_KEY_SETATTR</b>
              This  indicates  that  a  watched  key  had  its  attributes  (owner, group, permissions, timeout)
              modified.  <u>key_id</u> indicates the key that was modified and <u>aux</u> is unused.

   <b>Removal</b> <b>Notification</b>
       When a watched key  is  garbage  collected,  all  of  its  watches  are  automatically  destroyed  and  a
       notification is delivered to each watcher.  This will normally be an extended notification of the form:

           struct watch_notification_removal {
                struct watch_notification watch;
                __u64     id;
           };

       The  <u>watch.type</u>  field  will  be  set  to  <b>WATCH_TYPE_META</b>  and  the  <u>watch.subtype</u>  field  will  contain
       <b>WATCH_META_REMOVAL_NOTIFICATION</b>.  If the extended notification is given, then the length will be 2 units,
       otherwise it will be 1 and only the header will be present.

       The watch_id passed to <u>keyctl_watch_key</u>() will be placed in <u>watch.info</u> in the ID field.

       If the extension is present, <u>id</u> will be set to the ID of the destroyed key.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       On success <b>keyctl_watch_key</b>() returns <b>0</b> <b>.</b>  On error, the value <b>-1</b> will be returned and  <u>errno</u>  will  have
       been set to an appropriate error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ENOKEY</b> The specified key does not exist.

       <b>EKEYEXPIRED</b>
              The specified key has expired.

       <b>EKEYREVOKED</b>
              The specified key has been revoked.

       <b>EACCES</b> The named key exists, but does not grant <b>view</b> permission to the calling process.

       <b>EBUSY</b>  The specified key already has a watch on it for that device instance (add only).

       <b>EBADSLT</b>
              The specified key doesn't have a watch on it (removal only).

</pre><h4><b>LINKING</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  a  library  function  that  can  be  found  in <u>libkeyutils</u>.  When linking, <b>-lkeyutils</b> should be
       specified to the linker.
