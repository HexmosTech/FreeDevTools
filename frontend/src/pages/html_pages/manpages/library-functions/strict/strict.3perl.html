       strict - Perl pragma to restrict unsafe constructs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use strict;

           use strict "vars";
           use strict "refs";
           use strict "subs";

           use strict;
           no strict "vars";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "strict" pragma disables certain Perl expressions that could behave unexpectedly or are difficult to
       debug, turning them into errors. The effect of this pragma is limited to the current file or scope block.

       If no import list is supplied, all possible restrictions are assumed.  (This is the safest mode to
       operate in, but is sometimes too strict for casual programming.)  Currently, there are three possible
       things to be strict about:  "subs", "vars", and "refs".

       "strict refs"
             This generates a runtime error if you use symbolic references (see perlref).

                 use strict 'refs';
                 $ref = \$foo;
                 print $$ref;        # ok
                 $ref = "foo";
                 print $$ref;        # runtime error; normally ok
                 $file = "STDOUT";
                 print $file "Hi!";  # error; note: no comma after $file

             There is one exception to this rule:

                 $bar = \&amp;{'foo'};
                 &amp;$bar;

             is allowed so that "goto &amp;$AUTOLOAD" would not break under stricture.

       "strict vars"
             This  generates  a compile-time error if you access a variable that was neither explicitly declared
             (using any of "my", "our", "state", or "use vars") nor fully qualified.  (Because this is to  avoid
             variable  suicide  problems and subtle dynamic scoping issues, a merely "local" variable isn't good
             enough.)  See "my" in perlfunc, "our" in perlfunc, "state" in perlfunc, "local"  in  perlfunc,  and
             vars.

                 use strict 'vars';
                 $X::foo = 1;         # ok, fully qualified
                 my $foo = 10;        # ok, my() var
                 local $baz = 9;      # blows up, $baz not declared before

                 package Cinna;
                 our $bar;                   # Declares $bar in current package
                 $bar = 'HgS';               # ok, global declared via pragma

             The  <b>local()</b>  generated  a  compile-time error because you just touched a global name without fully
             qualifying it.

             Because of their special use by <b>sort()</b>, the variables $a and $b are exempted from this check.

       "strict subs"
             This disables the poetry optimization, generating a compile-time error if you try to use a bareword
             identifier that's not a subroutine, unless it is a  simple  identifier  (no  colons)  and  that  it
             appears  in curly braces, on the left hand side of the "=&gt;" symbol, or has the unary minus operator
             applied to it.

                 use strict 'subs';
                 $SIG{PIPE} = Plumber;   # blows up
                 $SIG{PIPE} = "Plumber"; # fine: quoted string is always ok
                 $SIG{PIPE} = \&amp;Plumber; # preferred form

       See "Pragmatic Modules" in perlmodlib.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       "strict 'subs'", with Perl 5.6.1, erroneously permitted to use  an  unquoted  compound  identifier  (e.g.
       "Foo::Bar")  as  a  hash  key (before "=&gt;" or inside curlies), but without forcing it always to a literal
       string.

       Starting with Perl 5.8.1 strict is strict about its restrictions: if unknown restrictions are  used,  the
       strict pragma will abort with

           Unknown 'strict' tag(s) '...'

       As  of  version 1.04 (Perl 5.10), strict verifies that it is used as "strict" to avoid the dreaded Strict
       trap on case insensitive file systems.

       Beginning with Perl 5.12, use of "use VERSION" (where VERSION &gt;= 5.11.0) now lexically enables strictures
       just like "use strict" (in addition to the normal "use VERSION" effects and features.)  In  other  words,
       "use  v5.011"  or  higher  now  implies  "use strict" automatically, as noted in "Implicit strictures" in
       perl5120delta and "use VERSION".
