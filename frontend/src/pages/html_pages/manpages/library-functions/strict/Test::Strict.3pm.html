</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Strict - Check syntax, presence of use strict; and test coverage

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.54

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       "Test::Strict" lets you check the syntax, presence of "use strict;" and presence "use warnings;" in your
       perl code.  It report its results in standard Test::Simple fashion:

           use Test::Strict tests =&gt; 3;
           syntax_ok( 'bin/myscript.pl' );
           strict_ok( 'My::Module', "use strict; in My::Module" );
           warnings_ok( 'lib/My/Module.pm' );

       Module authors can include the following in a t/strict.t and have "Test::Strict" automatically find and
       check all perl files in a module distribution:

         use Test::Strict;
         all_perl_files_ok(); # Syntax ok and use strict;

       or

           use Test::Strict;
           all_perl_files_ok( @mydirs );

       "Test::Strict" can also enforce a minimum test coverage the test suite should reach.  Module authors can
       include the following in a t/cover.t and have "Test::Strict" automatically check the test coverage:

           use Test::Strict;
           all_cover_ok( 80 );  # at least 80% coverage

       or

           use Test::Strict;
           all_cover_ok( 80, 't/' );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The most basic test one can write is "does it compile ?".  This module tests if the code compiles and
       play nice with Test::Simple modules.

       Another good practice this module can test is to "use strict;" in all perl files.

       By setting a minimum test coverage through all_cover_ok(), a code author can ensure his code is tested
       above a preset level of <u>kwality</u> throughout the development cycle.

       Along with Test::Pod, this module can provide the first tests to setup for a module author.

       This module should be able to run under the -T flag for perl &gt;= 5.6.  All paths are untainted with the
       following pattern: "qr|^([-+@\w./:\\]+)$|" controlled by $Test::Strict::UNTAINT_PATTERN.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>syntax_ok(</b> <b>$file</b> <b>[,</b> <b>$text]</b> <b>)</b>
       Run a syntax check on $file by running "perl -c $file" with an external perl interpreter.  The external
       perl interpreter path is stored in $Test::Strict::PERL which can be modified.  You may prefer use_ok()
       from Test::More to syntax test a module.  For a module, the path (lib/My/Module.pm) or the name
       (My::Module) can be both used.

   <b>strict_ok(</b> <b>$file</b> <b>[,</b> <b>$text]</b> <b>)</b>
       Check if $file contains a "use strict;" statement.  "use Moose" and "use Mouse" are also considered
       valid.  use Modern::Perl is also accepted.

       This is a pretty naive test which may be fooled in some edge cases.  For a module, the path
       (lib/My/Module.pm) or the name (My::Module) can be both used.

   <b>modules_enabling_strict</b>
       Experimental. Returning a list of modules and pragmata that enable strict.  To modify this list, change
       @Test::Strict::MODULES_ENABLING_STRICT.

       List taken from Module::CPANTS::Kwalitee::Uses v95

   <b>modules_enabling_warnings</b>
       Experimental. Returning a list of modules and pragmata that enable warnings To modify this list, change
       @Test::Strict::MODULES_ENABLING_WARNINGS.

       List taken from Module::CPANTS::Kwalitee::Uses v95

   <b>warnings_ok(</b> <b>$file</b> <b>[,</b> <b>$text]</b> <b>)</b>
       Check if warnings have been turned on.

       If $file is a module, check if it contains a "use warnings;" or "use warnings::..."  or "use Moose" or
       "use Mouse" statement. use Modern::Perl is also accepted.  If the perl version is &lt;= 5.6, this test is
       skipped ("use warnings" appeared in perl 5.6).

       If $file is a script, check if it starts with "#!...perl -w".  If the -w is not found and perl is &gt;= 5.6,
       check for a "use warnings;" or "use warnings::..."  or "use Moose" or "use Mouse" statement. use
       Modern::Perl is also accepted.

       This is a pretty naive test which may be fooled in some edge cases.  For a module, the path
       (lib/My/Module.pm) or the name (My::Module) can be both used.

   <b>all_perl_files_ok(</b> <b>[</b> <b>@directories</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       Applies strict_ok() and syntax_ok() to all perl files found in @directories (and sub directories).  If no
       &lt;@directories&gt; is given, the starting point is one level above the current running script, that should
       cover all the files of a typical CPAN distribution.  A perl file is *.pl or *.pm or *.t or a file
       starting with "#!...perl"

       If the test plan is defined:

         use Test::Strict tests =&gt; 18;
         all_perl_files_ok();

       the total number of files tested must be specified.

       You can control which tests are run on each perl site through:

         $Test::Strict::TEST_SYNTAX   (default = 1)
         $Test::Strict::TEST_STRICT   (default = 1)
         $Test::Strict::TEST_WARNINGS (default = 0)
         $Test::Strict::TEST_SKIP     (default = []) "Trusted" files to skip

   <b>all_cover_ok(</b> <b>[coverage_threshold</b> <b>[,</b> <b>@t_dirs]]</b> <b>)</b>
       This will run all the tests in @t_dirs (or current script's directory if @t_dirs is undef) under
       Devel::Cover and calculate the global test coverage of the code loaded by the tests.  If the test
       coverage is greater or equal than "coverage_threshold", it is a pass, otherwise it's a fail. The default
       coverage threshold is 50 (meaning 50% of the code loaded has been covered by test).

       The threshold can be modified through $Test::Strict::COVERAGE_THRESHOLD.

       You may want to select which files are selected for code coverage through
       $Test::Strict::DEVEL_COVER_OPTIONS, see Devel::Cover for the list of available options.  The default is
       '+ignore,"/Test/Strict\b"'.

       The path to "cover" utility can be modified through $Test::Strict::COVER.

       The 50% threshold is a completely arbitrary value, which should not be considered as a good enough
       coverage.

       The total coverage is the return value of all_cover_ok().

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       For all_cover_ok() to work properly, it is strongly advised to install the most recent version of
       Devel::Cover and use perl 5.8.1 or above.  In the case of a "make test" scenario, all_perl_files_ok() re-
       run all the tests in a separate perl interpreter, this may lead to some side effects.
