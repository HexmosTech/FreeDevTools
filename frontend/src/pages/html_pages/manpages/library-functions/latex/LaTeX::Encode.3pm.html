       LaTeX::Encode - encode characters for LaTeX formatting

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use LaTeX::Encode ':all', add =&gt; { '@' =&gt; 'AT' }, remove =&gt; [ '$' ];

         $latex_string  = latex_encode($text, %options);

         %old_encodings = add_latex_encodings( <a href="../man0x2002/chr.0x2002.html">chr</a>(0x2002) =&gt; '\\hspace{.6em}' );
         %old_encodings = remove_latex_encodings( '&lt;', '&gt;' );

         <a href="../man1/reset_latex_encodings.1.html">reset_latex_encodings</a>(1);

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page describes version 0.091.5 of the "LaTeX::Encode" module.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a function to encode text that is to be formatted with LaTeX.  It encodes characters
       that are special to LaTeX or that are represented in LaTeX by LaTeX text-mode commands.

       The special characters are: "\" (command character), "{" (open group), "}" (end group), "&amp;" (table column
       separator), "#" (parameter specifier), "%" (comment character), "_" (subscript), "^" (superscript), "~"
       (non-breakable space), "$" (mathematics mode).

       Note that some of the LaTeX commands for characters are defined in the LaTeX "textcomp" package.  If your
       text includes such characters, you will need to include the following lines in the preamble to your LaTeX
       document.

           \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
           \usepackage{textcomp}

       The function is useful for encoding data that is interpolated into LaTeX document templates, say with
       "Template::Plugin::Latex" (shameless plug!).

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b> <b>ABOUT</b> <b>UTF-8</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       Note that "latex_encode()" will encode a UTF8 string (a string with the UTF8 flag set) or a non-UTF8
       string, which will normally be regarded as ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) and will be upgraded to UTF8.  The UTF8
       flag indicates whether the contents of a string are regarded as a sequence of Unicode characters or as a
       string of bytes.  Refer to the Unicode Support in Perl, Perl Unicode Introduction and Perl Unicode
       Tutorial manual pages for more details.

       If you are seeing spurious LaTeX commands in the output of "latex_encode()" then it may be that you are
       reading from a UTF-8 input or have data with UTF-8 characters in a literal but the UTF8 flag is not being
       set correctly.  The fact that your programs are dealing with UTF-8 characters on a byte-by-byte basis may
       not be apparent normally as the terminal may make no distinction and happily display the byte sequence in
       the program's output as the UTF-8 characters they represent, however in a Perl program that deals with
       individual characters, what happens is that the individual bytes that make up multi-byte characters are
       regarded as separate characters; if the strings are promoted to UTF8 strings then the individual bytes
       are converted separately to UTF8.  This is termed double encoding.  "latex_encode()" will then map the
       double-encoded characters.

       If the input text is Western European text then what you are likely to see in the output from
       "latex_encode()" is spurious sequences of "{\^A}" or "{\~A}" followed by the mapping of an apparently
       random character (or the right character if it is a symbol such as the Sterling POUND sign, i.e. "Â£" will
       map to "{\^A}\textsterling"); this is because the initial byte of a two-byte UTF-8 character in the
       LATIN1 range will either be 0xC2 or 0xC3 and the next byte will always have the top two bits set to 10 to
       indicate that it is a continuation byte.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES/METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "latex_encode($text, %options)"
           Encodes  the specified text such that it is suitable for processing with LaTeX.  The behaviour of the
           filter is modified by the options:

           "except"
               Lists the characters that should be excluded from encoding.  By default no special characters are
               excluded, but it may be useful to specify "except = "\\{}"" to allow the input string to  contain
               LaTeX  commands  such  as  "this  is \\textbf{bold} text" (the doubled backslashes in the strings
               represent Perl escapes, and will be evaluated to single backslashes).

           "iquotes"
               If true then single or double quotes around words will be  changed  to  LaTeX  single  or  double
               quotes; double quotes around a phrase will be converted to "``" and "''" and single quotes to "`"
               and "'".  This is sometimes called "intelligent quotes"

           "packages"
               If  passed  a  reference  to  a  hash  "latex_encode()"  will update the hash with names of LaTeX
               packages that are required for typesetting the encoded string.

       "add_latex_encodings(%encodings)"
           Adds a set of new or modified encodings.  Returns a hash of any encodings that were modified.

       "remove_latex_encodings(@keys)"
           Removes a set of encodings.  Returns a hash of the removed encodings.

       "reset_latex_encodings($forget_import_specifiers)"
           Resets the LaTeX encodings to the state that they were when the  module  was  loaded  (including  any
           additions  and  removals  specified  on  the 'use' statement), or to the standard set of encodings if
           $forget_import_specifiers is true.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following snippet shows how data from a database can be encoded and inserted into a LaTeX table,  the
       source of which is generated with "LaTeX::Table".

           my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare('select col1, col2, col3 from table where $expr');
           $sth-&gt;execute;
           while (my $href = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_hashref) {
               my @row;
               foreach my $col (qw(col1 col2 col3)) {
                   push(@row, latex_encode($href-&gt;{$col}));
               }
               push @data, \@row;
           }

           my $headings = [ [ 'Col1', 'Col2', 'Col3' ] ];

           my $table = LaTeX::Table-&gt;new( { caption =&gt; 'My caption',
                                            label   =&gt; 'table:caption',
                                            type    =&gt; 'xtab',
                                            header  =&gt; $header,
                                            data    =&gt; \@data } );

           my $table_text = $table-&gt;generate_string;

       Now $table_text can be interpolated into a LaTeX document template.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       None.   You  could  probably  break  the  "latex_encode" function by passing it an array reference as the
       options, but there are no checks for that.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Not applicable.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       The "HTML::Entities" and "Pod::LaTeX" modules were used for building the encoding table but this  is  not
       rebuilt  at installation time.  The "LaTeX::Driver" module is used for formatting the character encodings
       reference document.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None known.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Not all LaTeX special characters are included in the encoding tables (more may be added when I track down
       the definitions).
