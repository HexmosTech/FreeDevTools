</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a method to convert LaTeX markups for accents etc.  into their Unicode equivalents.
       It translates some commands for special characters or accents into their Unicode (or HTML) equivalents
       and removes formatting commands. It is not at all bulletproof or complete.

       This module is intended to convert fragments of LaTeX source, such as bibliography entries and abstracts,
       into plain text (or, optionally, simplistic HTML). It is not a document conversion system. Math, tables,
       figures, sectioning, etc., are not handled in any way, and mostly left in their TeX form in the output.
       The translations assume standard LaTeX meanings for characters and control sequences; macros in the input
       are not considered.

       The aim for all the output is utter simplicity and minimalism, not faithful translation. For example,
       although Unicode has a code point for a thin space, the LaTeX "\thinspace" (etc.) command is translated
       to the empty string; such spacing refinements desirable in the TeX output are, in our experience,
       generally not desired in the HTML output from this tool.

       As another example, TeX "%" comments are not removed, even on lines by themselves, because they may be
       inside verbatim blocks, and we don't attempt to keep any such context. In practice, TeX comments are rare
       in the text fragments intended to be handled, so removing them in advance has not been a great burden.

       As another example, LaTeX ties, "~" characters, are replaced with normal spaces (exception: unless they
       follow a "/" character or at the beginning of a line, when they're assumed to be part of a url or a
       pathname), rather than a no-break space character, because in our experience most ties intended for the
       TeX output would just cause trouble in plain text or HTML.

       Regarding normal whitespace: all leading and trailing horizontal whitespace (that is, SPC and TAB) is
       removed. All internal horizontal whitespace sequences are collapsed to a single space.

       After the conversions, all brace characters ("{}") are simply removed from the returned string. This
       turns out to be a significant convenience in practice, since many LaTeX commands which take arguments
       don't need to do anything for our purposes except output the argument.

       On the other hand, backslashes are not removed. This is so the caller can check for "\\" and thus
       discover untranslated commands. Of course there are many other constructs that might not be translated,
       or translated wrongly. There is no escaping the need to carefully look at the output.

       Suggestions and bug reports are welcome for practical needs; we know full well that there are hundreds of
       commands not handled that could be.  Virtually all the behavior mentioned here would be easily made
       customizable, if there is a need to do so.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>convert(</b> <b>$latex_string,</b> <b>%options</b> <b>)</b>
       Convert the text in $latex_string into a plain(er) Unicode string.  Escape sequences for accented and
       special characters (e.g., "\i", "\"a", ...) are converted. A few basic formatting commands (e.g., "{\it
       ...}") are removed. See the LaTeX::ToUnicode::Tables submodule for the full conversion tables.

       These keys are recognized in %options:

       "entities"
           Output "&amp;#xUUUU;" entities (valid in XML); in this case, also convert the &lt;, &gt;, "&amp;" metacharacters to
           entities.  Recognized  non-ASCII  Unicode  characters  in  the  original  input are also converted to
           entities, not only the translations from TeX commands.

           The default is to output literal (binary) Unicode characters, and not change any metacharacters.

       "german"
           If this option is set, the commands introduced by the package `german' (e.g. ""a" eq  "ä",  note  the
           missing backslash) are also handled.

       "html"
           If  this option is set, the output is simplistic html rather than plain text. This affects only a few
           things: 1) the output of urls from  "\url"  and  "\href";  2) the  output  of  markup  commands  like
           "\textbf"  (but  nested  markup  commands  don't  work); 3) two other random commands, "\enquote" and
           "\path", because they are needed.

       "hook"
           The value must be a function that takes two arguments and returns a string. The first argument is the
           incoming string (may be multiple lines), and the second argument is  a  hash  reference  of  options,
           exactly what was passed to this "convert" function. Thus the hook can detect whether html is needed.

           The  hook  is  called (almost) right away, before any of the other conversions have taken place. That
           way the hook can make use of the predefined conversions instead of repeating them. The  only  changes
           made  to  the  input  string  before  the hook is called are trivial: leading and trailing whitespace
           (space and tab) on each line are removed, and, for HTML output, incoming  ampersand,  less-than,  and
           greater-than characters are replaced with their entities.

           Any  substitutions  that  result  in Unicode code points must use "\\x{nnnn}" on the right hand side:
           that's two backslashes and a four-digit hex number.

           As an example, here is a skeleton of the hook function for TUGboat:

             sub LaTeX_ToUnicode_convert_hook {
               my ($string,$options) = @_;

               my $endcw = $LaTeX::ToUnicode::endcw;
               die "no endcw regexp in LaTeX::ToUnicode??" if ! $endcw;

               ...
               $string =~ s/\\newline$endcw/ /g;

               # TUB's \acro{} takes an argument, but we do nothing with it.
               # The braces will be removed by convert().
               $string =~ s/\\acro$endcw//g;
               ...
               $string =~ s/\\CTAN$endcw/CTAN/g;
               $string =~ s/\\Dash$endcw/\\x{2014}/g; # em dash; replacement is string
               ...

               # ignore \begin{abstract} and \end{abstract} commands.
               $string =~ s,\\(begin|end)$endcw\{abstract\}\s*,,g;

               # Output for our url abbreviations, and other commands, depends on
               # whether we're generating plain text or HTML.
               if ($options-&gt;{html}) {
                   # HTML.
                   # \tbsurl{URLBASE} -&gt; &lt;a href="https://URLBASE"&gt;URLBASE&lt;/a&gt;
                   $string =~ s,\\tbsurl$endcw\{([^}]*)\}
                               ,&lt;a href="https://$1"&gt;$1&lt;/a&gt;,gx;
                   ...
                   # varepsilon, and no line break at hyphen.
                   $string =~ s,\\eTeX$endcw,\\x{03B5}&lt;nobr&gt;-&lt;/nobr&gt;TeX,g;

               } else {
                   # for plain text, we can just prepend the protocol:/<a href="file:/.">/.</a>
                   $string =~ s,\\tbsurl$endcw,https://,g;
                   ...
                   $string =~ s,\\eTeX$endcw,\\x{03B5}-TeX,g;
               }
               ...
               return $string;
             }

           As shown here for "\eTeX" (an abbreviation macro defined in the TUGboat style files),  if  markup  is
           desired  in  the  output, the substitutions must be different for HTML and plain text. Otherwise, the
           desired HTML markup is transliterated as if it were plain text. Or  else  the  translations  must  be
           extended  so  that  TeX  markup  can  be  used  on  the  rhs  to  be  replaced  with the desired HTML
           ("&amp;lt;nobr&amp;gt;" in this case).

           For   the   full   definition   (and   plenty   of   additional   information),    see    the    file
           "ltx2crossrefxml-tugboat.cfg"       in       the       TUGboat       source       repository       at
           &lt;https://github.com/TeXUsersGroup/tugboat/tree/trunk/capsules/crossref&gt;.

           The hook function is specified in the convert() call like this:

             LaTeX::ToUnicode::convert(..., { hook =&gt; \&amp;LaTeX_ToUnicode_convert_hook })

   <b>debuglevel(</b> <b>$level</b> <b>)</b>
       Output debugging information if $level is nonzero.

   <b>$endcw</b>
       A predefined regexp for terminating TeX control words  (not  control  symbols!).  Can  be  used  in,  for
       example, hook functions:

         my $endcw = $LaTeX::ToUnicode::endcw;
         $string =~ s/\\newline$endcw/ /g; # translate \newline to space

       It's defined as follows:

         our $endcw = qr/(?&lt;=[a-zA-Z])(?=[^a-zA-Z]|$)\s*/;

       That  is, look behind for an alphabetic character, then look ahead for a non-alphabetic character (or end
       of line), then consume whitespace.  Fingers crossed.
