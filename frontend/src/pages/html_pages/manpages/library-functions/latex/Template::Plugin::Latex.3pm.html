       Template::Plugin::Latex - Template Toolkit plugin for Latex

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This documentation refers to "Template::Plugin::Latex" version 3.12

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Sample Template Toolkit code:

           [%- USE Latex;

               mystr = "a, b &amp; c" | latex_encode;

               FILTER latex("pdf");  -%]

           \documentclass{article}
           \begin{document}
             This is a PDF document generated by
             LaTeX and the Template Toolkit, with some
             interpolated data: [% mystr %]
           \end{document}

           [%  END; -%]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "Latex" Template Toolkit plugin provides a "latex" filter that allows the use of LaTeX to generate
       PDF, PostScript and DVI output files from the Template Toolkit.  The plugin uses LaTeX::Driver to run the
       various LaTeX programs.

       Processing of the LaTeX document takes place in a temporary directory that is deleted once processing is
       complete.  The standard LaTeX programs ("latex" or "pdflatex", "bibtex" and "makeindex") are run and re-
       run as necessary until all references, indexes, bibliographies, table of contents, and lists of figures
       and tables are stable or it is apparent that they will not stabilize.  The format converters "dvips",
       "dvipdf", "ps2pdf" and "pdf2ps" are run as necessary to convert the output document to the requested
       format.  The "TEXINPUTS" environment variable is set up to include the template directory and the
       "INCLUDES" directories, so that LaTeX file inclusion commands should find the intended files.

       The output of the filter is binary data (although PDF and PostScript are not stictly binary).  You should
       be careful not to prepend or append any extraneous characters (even space characters) or text outside the
       FILTER block as this text will be included in the file output.  Notice in the example below how we use
       the post-chomp flags ('-') at the end of the "USE" and "END" directives to remove the trailing newline
       characters:

           [% USE Latex(format='pdf') -%]
           [% FILTER latex %]
           ...LaTeX document...
           [% END -%]

       If you're redirecting the output to a file via the third argument of the Template module's "process()"
       method then you should also pass the "binmode" parameter, set to a true value to indicate that it is a
       binary file.

           use Template;

           my $tt = Template-&gt;new({
               INCLUDE_PATH =&gt; '/path/to/templates',
               OUTPUT_PATH  =&gt; '/path/to/pdf/output',
           });
           my $vars = {
               title =&gt; 'Hello World',
           }
           $tt-&gt;process('example.tt2', $vars, 'example.pdf', binmode =&gt; 1)
               || die $tt-&gt;error();

       If you want to capture the output to a template variable, you can do so like this:

           [% output = FILTER latex %]
           ...LaTeX document...
           [% END %]

       You can pass additional arguments when you invoke the filter, for example to specify the output format.

           [% FILTER latex(format='pdf') -%]
              ...LaTeX document...
           [% END %]

       If you want to write the output to a file then you can specify an "output" parameter.

           [% FILTER latex(output='example.pdf') %]
           ...LaTeX document...
           [% END %]

       If you don't explicitly specify an output format then the filename extension (e.g. 'pdf' in the above
       example) will be used to determine the correct format.

       You can specify a different filter name using the "filter" parameter.

           [% USE Latex(filter='pdf') -%]
           [% FILTER pdf %]
           ...LaTeX document...
           [% END %]

       You can also specify the default output format.  This value can be "latex", "pdf" or "dvi".

           [% USE Latex(format='pdf') %]

       Note: the "LaTeX::Driver" distribution includes three filter programs ("latex2dvi", "latex2pdf" and
       "latex2ps") that use the "LaTeX::Driver" package to process LaTeX source data into DVI, PDF or PostScript
       file respectively.  These programs have a "-tt2" option to run their input through the Template Toolkit
       before processing as LaTeX source.  The programs do not use the "Latex" plugin unless the template
       requests it, but they may provide an alternative way of processing Template Toolkit templates to generate
       typeset output.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES/METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"USE</b> <b>Latex(options)"</b>
       This statement loads the plugin (note that prior to version 2.15 the filter was built in to Template
       Toolkit so this statement was unnecessary; it is now required).

   <b>The</b> <b>"latex"</b> <b>Filter</b>
       The "latex" filter accepts a number of options, which may be specified on the USE statement or on the
       filter invocation.

       "format"
           specifies  the  format of the output; one of "dvi" (TeX device independent format), "ps" (PostScript)
           or "pdf" (Adobe Portable Document Format).  The follow special values are  also  accepted:  "pdf(ps)"
           (generates  PDF via PostScript, using "dvips" and "ps2pdf"), "pdf(dvi)" (generates PDF via dvi, using
           "dvipdfm")

       "output"
           the name of the output file, or just the output format

       "indexstyle"
           the name of the "makeindex" style file to use (this is passed with the "-s" option to "makeindex")

       "indexoptions"
           options to be passed to "makeindex".  Useful options are "-l" for  letter  ordering  of  index  terms
           (rather  than  the default word ordering), "-r" to disable implicit page range formation, and "-c" to
           compress intermediate blanks in index keys. Refer to <b><a href="../man1/makeindex.1.html">makeindex</a></b>(1) for full details.

       "maxruns"
           The maximum number of runs of the formatter program (defaults to 10).

       "extraruns"
           The number of additional runs of the formatter program after it seems  that  the  formatting  of  the
           document  has  stabilized  (default  0).   Note that the setting of "maxruns" takes precedence, so if
           "maxruns" is set to 10 and "extraruns" is set to 3, and formatting stabilizes after 8 runs then  only
           2 extra runs will be performed.

   <b>The</b> <b>"latex_encode"</b> <b>filter</b>
       The  "latex_encode"  filter  encodes  LaTeX  special  characters  in  its  input into their LaTeX encoded
       representations.  It also encodes other characters that have

       The special characters are: "\" (command character), "{" (open group), "}" (end group), "&amp;" (table column
       separator), "#" (parameter specifier), "%" (comment character), "_" (subscript), "^"  (superscript),  "~"
       (non-breakable space), "$" (mathematics mode).

       "except"
           Lists  the  characters  that  should be excluded from encoding.  By default no special characters are
           excluded, but it may be useful to specify "except = "\\{}"" to allow  the  input  string  to  contain
           LaTeX commands such as "this is \textbf{bold} text".

       "use_textcomp"
           By  default  the  "latex_encode"  filter  will  encode  characters with the encodings provided by the
           "textcomp" LaTeX package (for example the Pounds Sterling symbol is  encoded  as  "\textsterling{}").
           Setting "use_textcomp = 0" turns off these encodings.

   <b>"table()"</b>
       The "table()" function provides an interface to the "LaTeX::Table" module.

       The following example shows how a simple table can be set up.

           [%- USE Latex;

               data = [ [ 'London', 'United Kingdom' ],
                        [ 'Berlin', 'Germany'        ],
                        [ 'Paris',  'France'         ],
                        [ 'Washington', 'USA'        ] ] );

               text = Latex.table( caption  = 'Capitol Cities',
                                   label    = 'table:capitols',
                                   headings = [ [ 'City', 'Country' ] ],
                                   data     = data );
            -%]

       The  variable  "text"  will  hold the LaTeX commands to typeset the table and can be further interpolated
       into a LaTeX document template.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Most failures result from invalid LaTeX input and are propagated up from LaTeX::Driver, LaTeX::Encode  or
       LaTeX::Table.

       Failures detected in this module include:

       "OUTPUT_PATH is not set"
           an output filename was specified but the "OUTPUT_PATH" configuration option has not been set.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       Template
           The Template Toolkit.

       LaTeX::Driver
           Provides the logic for driving the LaTeX programs.

       LaTeX::Encode
           Underpins the "latex_encode" filter.

       LaTeX::Table
           Underpins the "table" function.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       The  "latex"  filter was distributed as part of the core Template Toolkit distribution until version 2.15
       (released in May 2006), when it was moved into the separate  Template-Latex  distribution.   The  "Latex"
       plugin must now be explicitly to enable the "latex" filter.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  paths  to the <u>latex</u>, <u>pdflatex</u> and <u>dvips</u> should be pre-defined as part of the installation process of
       LaTeX::Driver (i.e. when you run "perl  Makefile.PL"  for  that  package).   Alternative  values  can  be
       specified  from  Perl  code  using  the  "program_path"  class  method  from  that package, but there are
       deliberately no options to specify these paths from TT code.
