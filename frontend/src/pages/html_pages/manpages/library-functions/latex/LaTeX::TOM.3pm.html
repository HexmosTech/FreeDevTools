</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a parser which parses and interprets (though not fully) LaTeX documents and returns
       a tree-based representation of what it finds.  This tree is a "LaTeX::TOM::Tree".  The tree contains
       "LaTeX::TOM::Node" nodes.

       This module should be especially useful to anyone who wants to do processing of LaTeX documents that
       requires extraction of plain-text information, or altering of the plain-text components (or
       alternatively, the math-text components).

</pre><h4><b>COMPONENTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>LaTeX::TOM::Parser</b>
       The parser recognizes 3 parameters upon creation by "LaTeX::TOM-&gt;new".  The parameters, in order, are

       parse error handling (= <b>0</b> || 1 || 2)
           Determines  what  happens when a parse error is encountered.  0 results in a warning.  1 results in a
           die.  2 results in silence.  Note that particular groupings in LaTeX (i.e. newcommands and the  like)
           contain  invalid  TeX  or  LaTeX, so you nearly always need this parameter to be 0 or 2 to completely
           parse the document.

       read inputs flag (= 0 || <b>1</b>)
           This flag determines whether a scan for "\input" and "\input-like" commands  is  performed,  and  the
           resulting  called  files parsed and added to the parent parse tree.  0 means no, 1 means do it.  Note
           that this will happen recursively if it is turned on.  Also, bibliographies (<u>.bbl</u> files) are detected
           and included.

       apply mappings flag (= 0 || <b>1</b>)
           This flag  determines  whether  (most)  user-defined  mappings  are  applied.   This  means  "\defs",
           "\newcommands",  and  "\newenvironments".  This is critical for properly analyzing the content of the
           document, as this must be phrased in terms of the semantics of the original TeX and  LaTeX  commands,
           not  ad hoc user macros.  So, for instance, do not expect plain-text extraction to work properly with
           this option off.

       The parser returns a "LaTeX::TOM::Tree" ($document in the SYNOPSIS).

   <b>LaTeX::TOM::Node</b>
       Nodes may be of the following types:

       TEXT
           "TEXT" nodes can be thought of as representing the plain-text portions of the LaTeX  document.   This
           includes  math  and  anything  else  that  is  not a recognized TeX or LaTeX command, or user-defined
           command.  In reality, "TEXT" nodes contain commands that this  parser  does  not  yet  recognize  the
           semantics of.

       COMMAND
           A  "COMMAND"  node  represents  a  TeX command.  It always has child nodes in a tree, though the tree
           might be empty if the command operates on zero parameters. An example of a command is

            \textbf{blah}

           This would parse into a "COMMAND" node for "textbf", which would have a subtree containing the "TEXT"
           node with text ``blah.''

       ENVIRONMENT
           Similarly,  TeX  environments  parse  into  "ENVIRONMENT"  nodes,  which  have  metadata  about   the
           environment, along with a subtree representing what is contained in the environment.  For example,

            \begin{equation}
              r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
            \end{equation}

           Would  parse  into  an  "ENVIRONMENT" node of the class ``equation'' with a child tree containing the
           result of parsing ``r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.''

       GROUP
           A "GROUP" is like an anonymous "COMMAND".  Since you can put whatever you want in curly-braces ("{}")
           in TeX in order to make semantically isolated regions, this separation is preserved by the parser.  A
           "GROUP" is just the subtree of the parsed contents of plain curly-braces.

           It is important to note that currently only the first "GROUP" in a series  of  "GROUP"s  following  a
           LaTeX  command  will  actually  be parsed into a "COMMAND" node.  The reason is that, for the initial
           purposes of this module, it  was  not  necessary  to  recognize  additional  "GROUP"s  as  additional
           parameters  to  the  "COMMAND".   However,  this  is  something  that  this  module  really should do
           eventually.  Currently if you want all the parameters to a multi-parametered command, you'll need  to
           pick out all the following "GROUP" nodes yourself.

           Eventually  this  will  become something like a list which is stored in the "COMMAND" node, much like
           XML::DOM's treatment of attributes.  These are, in a sense, apart from the rest of the document tree.
           Then "GROUP" nodes will become much more rare.

       COMMENT
           A "COMMENT" node is very similar to a "TEXT" node, except it is specifically for lines beginning with
           ``%'' (the TeX comment delimiter) or the right-hand portion of a line that has ``%'' at some internal
           point.

   <b>LaTeX::TOM::Trees</b>
       As mentioned before, the Tree is the return result of a parse.

       The tree is nothing more than an arrayref of Nodes, some of which may contain their own trees.   This  is
       useful  knowledge  at  this  point,  since  the user isn't provided with a full suite of convenient tree-
       modification methods.  However, Trees do already have some very convenient methods, described in the next
       section.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>LaTeX::TOM</b>
       <u>new</u>

       ""  Instantiate a new parser object.

       In this section all of the methods for each of the components are listed and described.

   <b>LaTeX::TOM::Parser</b>
       The methods for the parser are:

       <u>parseFile</u> <u>(filename)</u>

       ""  Read in the contents of <u>filename</u> and parse them, returning a "LaTeX::TOM::Tree".

       <u>parse</u> <u>(string)</u>

       ""  Parse the string <u>string</u> and return a "LaTeX::TOM::Tree".

   <b>LaTeX::TOM::Tree</b>
       This section contains methods for the Trees returned by the parser.

       <u>copy</u>

       ""  Duplicate a tree into new memory.

       <u>print</u>

       ""  A debug print of the structure of the tree.

       <u>plainText</u>

       ""  Returns an arrayref which is a list of strings representing the text of all  "getNodePlainTextFlag  =
           1" "TEXT" nodes, in an inorder traversal.

       <u>indexableText</u>

       ""  A  method  like  the  above  but  which goes one step further; it cleans all of the returned text and
           concatenates it into a single string which one could consider having all of the standard  information
           retrieval value for the document, making it useful for indexing.

       <u>toLaTeX</u>

       ""  Return  a  string  representing  the  LaTeX  encoded by the tree.  This is especially useful to get a
           normal document again, after modifying nodes of the tree.

       <u>getTopLevelNodes</u>

       ""  Return a list of "LaTeX::TOM::Nodes" at the top level of the Tree.

       <u>getAllNodes</u>

       ""  Return an arrayref with <b>all</b> nodes of the tree.  This "flattens" the tree.

       <u>getCommandNodesByName</u> <u>(name)</u>

       ""  Return an arrayref with all "COMMAND" nodes in the tree which have a name matching <u>name</u>.

       <u>getEnvironmentsByName</u> <u>(name)</u>

       ""  Return an arrayref with all "ENVIRONMENT" nodes in the tree which have a class matching <u>name</u>.

       <u>getNodesByCondition</u> <u>(code</u> <u>reference)</u>

       ""  This is a catch-all search method which can be used to pull out nodes that match pretty much any perl
           expression, without manually having to traverse the tree.  <u>code</u> <u>reference</u> is a  perl  code  reference
           which  receives  as  its  first  argument  the  node of the tree that is currently scrutinized and is
           expected to return a boolean value. See the SYNOPSIS for examples.

       <u>getFirstNode</u>

       ""  Returns the first node of the tree.  This is useful if you want to walk the tree  yourself,  starting
           with the first node.

   <b>LaTeX::TOM::Node</b>
       This section contains the methods for nodes of the parsed Trees.

       <u>getNodeType</u>

       ""  Returns the type, one of "TEXT", "COMMAND", "ENVIRONMENT", "GROUP", or "COMMENT", as described above.

       <u>getNodeText</u>

       ""  Applicable for "TEXT" or "COMMENT" nodes; this returns the document text they contain.  This is undef
           for other node types.

       <u>setNodeText</u>

       ""  Set the node text, also for "TEXT" and "COMMENT" nodes.

       <u>getNodeStartingPosition</u>

       ""  Get  the  starting  character position in the document of this node.  For "TEXT" and "COMMENT" nodes,
           this will be where the text begins.  For "ENVIRONMENT", "COMMAND", or "GROUP" nodes, this will be the
           position of the <u>last</u> character of the opening identifier.

       <u>getNodeEndingPosition</u>

       ""  Same as above, but for last character.  For "GROUP", "ENVIRONMENT", or "COMMAND" nodes, this will  be
           the <u>first</u> character of the closing identifier.

       <u>getNodeOuterStartingPosition</u>

       ""  Same as getNodeStartingPosition, but for "GROUP", "ENVIRONMENT", or "COMMAND" nodes, this returns the
           <u>first</u> character of the opening identifier.

       <u>getNodeOuterEndingPosition</u>

       ""  Same  as  getNodeEndingPosition, but for "GROUP", "ENVIRONMENT", or "COMMAND" nodes, this returns the
           <u>last</u> character of the closing identifier.

       <u>getNodeMathFlag</u>

       ""  This applies to any node type.  It is 1 if the node sets, or is contained within, a math mode region.
           0 otherwise.  "TEXT" nodes which have this flag as 1 can be assumed  to  be  the  actual  mathematics
           contained in the document.

       <u>getNodePlainTextFlag</u>

       ""  This  applies  only to "TEXT" nodes.  It is 1 if the node is non-math <b>and</b> is visible (in other words,
           will end up being a part of the output document). One would only want to index "TEXT" nodes with this
           property, for information retrieval purposes.

       <u>getEnvironmentClass</u>

       ""  This applies only to "ENVIRONMENT" nodes.  Returns what class of environment the node represents (the
           "X" in "\begin{X}" and "\end{X}").

       <u>getCommandName</u>

       ""  This applies only to "COMMAND" nodes.  Returns the name of the command (the "X" in "\X{...}").

       <u>getChildTree</u>

       ""  This applies only to "COMMAND", "ENVIRONMENT", and "GROUP" nodes: it returns  the  "LaTeX::TOM::Tree"
           which is ``under'' the calling node.

       <u>getFirstChild</u>

       ""  This  applies only to "COMMAND", "ENVIRONMENT", and "GROUP" nodes: it returns the first node from the
           first level of the child subtree.

       <u>getLastChild</u>

       ""  Same as above, but for the last node of the first level.

       <u>getPreviousSibling</u>

       ""  Return the prior node on the same level of the tree.

       <u>getNextSibling</u>

       ""  Same as above, but for following node.

       <u>getParent</u>

       ""  Get the parent node of this node in the tree.

       <u>getNextGroupNode</u>

       ""  This is an interesting function, and kind of a hack because of the way the parser makes  the  current
           tree.   Basically  it will give you the next sibling that is a "GROUP" node, until it either hits the
           end of the tree level, a "TEXT" node which doesn't match "/^\s*$/", or a "COMMAND" node.

           This is useful for finding all "GROUP"ed parameters after a "COMMAND" node (see comments for  "GROUP"
           in  the  "COMPONENTS"  / "LaTeX::TOM::Node" section).  You can just have a while loop that calls this
           method until it gets "undef", and you'll know you've found all the parameters to a command.

           Note: this may be bad, but "TEXT" Nodes matching "/^\s*\[[0-9]+\]$/" (optional parameter groups)  are
           treated as if they were 'blank'.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Due  to  the  lack  of  tree-modification  methods,  currently  this  module  is  mostly useful for minor
       modifications to the parsed document, for instance, altering the text of "TEXT" nodes  but  not  deleting
       the  nodes.   Of  course,  the  user can still do this by breaking abstraction and directly modifying the
       Tree.

       Also note that the parsing is not complete.  This module was not written with the intention of being able
       to produce output documents the way ``latex'' does.  The intent was instead to be  able  to  analyze  and
       modify  the  document  on a logical level with regards to the content; it doesn't care about the document
       formatting and outputting side of TeX/LaTeX.

       There is much work still to be done.  See the <u>TODO</u> list in the <u>TOM.pm</u> source.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Probably plenty.  However, this module has performed fairly well on a set of ~1000 research  publications
       from  the  Computing  Research  Repository, so I deemed it ``good enough'' to use for purposes similar to
       mine.

       Please let the maintainer know of parser errors if you discover any.
