         use base 'My::Lycanthrope';

                 die "We only strangle ducks";
             }
             print "Farmer Joe wrings the duck's neck\n";
             print "Said the duck, '" . $duck-&gt;quack . "'\n";
             print "We ate well that night.\n";
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5 doesn't natively support Java-style interfaces, and it doesn't support Perl 6 style roles either.

       You can get both of these things in half a dozen different ways via various CPAN modules, but they
       usually require that you buy into "their way" of implementing your code.

       Other have turned to "duck typing".

       This is, for the most part, a fairly naive check that says "can you do this method", under the "if it
       looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck".

       It assumes that if you have a "-&gt;quack" method, then they will treat you as a duck, because doing things
       like adding "Duck" to your @ISA array means you are also forced to take their implementation.

       There is, of course, a better way.

       For better or worse, Perl's "-&gt;isa" functionality to determine if something is or is not a particular
       class/object is defined as a <b>method</b>, not a function, and so that means that as well as adding something
       to you @ISA array, so that Perl's "UNIVERSAL::isa" method can work with it, you are also allowed to
       simply overload your own "isa" method and answer directly whether or not you are something.

       The simplest form of the idiom looks like this.

         sub isa {
             return 1 if $_[1] eq 'Duck';
             shift-&gt;SUPER::isa(@_);
         }

       This reads "Check my type as normal, but if anyone wants to know if I'm a duck, then tell them yes".

       Now, there are a few people that have argued that this is "lying" about your class, but this argument is
       based on the idea that @ISA is somehow more "real" than using the method directly.

       It also assumes that what you advertise you implement needs to be in sync with the method resolution for
       any given function. But in the best and cleanest implementation of code, the API is orthogonal (although
       most often related) to the implementation.

       And although @ISA is about implementation <b>and</b> API, overloading "isa" to let you change your API is not at
       all bad when seen in this light.

   <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>asa.pm</b> <b>do?</b>
       Much as base provides convenient syntactic sugar for loading your parent class and setting @ISA, this
       pragma will provide convenient syntactic sugar for creating your own custom overloaded isa functions.

       Beyond just the idiom above, it implements various workarounds for some edge cases, so you don't have to,
       and allows clear separation of concerns.

       You should just be able to use it, and if something ever goes wrong, then it's my fault, and I'll fix it.

   <b>What</b> <b>doesn't</b> <b>asa.pm</b> <b>do?</b>
       In Perl, highly robust introspection is <b>really</b> hard. Which is why most modules that provide some level of
       interface functionality require you to explicitly define them in multiple classes, and start to tread on
       your toes.

       This class does <b>not</b> do any strict enforcement of interfaces. 90% of the time, what you want to do, and
       the methods you need to implement, are going to be pretty obvious, so it's your fault if you don't
       provide them.

       But at least this way, you can implement them however you like, and "asa" will just take care of the
       details of safely telling everyone else you are a duck :)

   <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>Duck</b> <b>method</b> <b>clashes</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>My::Package</b> <b>method?</b>
       Unlike Perl 6, which implements a concept called "multi-methods", Perl 5 does not have a native approach
       to solving the problem of "API collision".

       Originally from the Java/C++ world, the problem of overcoming language API limitations can be done
       through the use of one of several "design patterns".

       For you, the victim of API collision, you might be interested in the "Adapter" pattern.

       For more information on implementing the Adapter pattern in Perl, see Class::Adapter, which provides a
       veritable toolkit for creating an implementation of the Adapter pattern which can solve your problem.
