</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       alarm — schedule an alarm signal

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;

       unsigned alarm(unsigned <u>seconds</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>alarm</u>() function shall cause the system to generate a SIGALRM signal for the process after the number
       of  realtime  seconds  specified  by  <u>seconds</u>  have  elapsed. Processor scheduling delays may prevent the
       process from handling the signal as soon as it is generated.

       If <u>seconds</u> is 0, a pending alarm request, if any, is canceled.

       Alarm requests are not stacked; only one SIGALRM generation can be  scheduled  in  this  manner.  If  the
       SIGALRM  signal  has  not yet been generated, the call shall result in rescheduling the time at which the
       SIGALRM signal is generated.

       Interactions between <u>alarm</u>() and <u>setitimer</u>() are unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       If there is a previous <u>alarm</u>() request with time remaining, <u>alarm</u>() shall return a non-zero value that is
       the number of seconds until the previous request  would  have  generated  a  SIGALRM  signal.  Otherwise,
       <u>alarm</u>() shall return 0.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>alarm</u>() function is always successful, and no return value is reserved to indicate an error.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>fork</u>() function clears pending alarms in the child process. A new process image created by one of the
       <u>exec</u> functions inherits the time left to an alarm signal in the image of the old process.

       Application  developers should note that the type of the argument <u>seconds</u> and the return value of <u>alarm</u>()
       is <b>unsigned</b>.  That means that a Strictly Conforming POSIX System Interfaces  Application  cannot  pass  a
       value  greater  than the minimum guaranteed value for {UINT_MAX}, which the ISO C standard sets as 65535,
       and any application passing a  larger  value  is  restricting  its  portability.  A  different  type  was
       considered,  but  historical  implementations,  including  those with a 16-bit <b>int</b> type, consistently use
       either <b>unsigned</b> or <b>int</b>.

       Application developers should be aware of possible interactions when  the  same  process  uses  both  the
       <u>alarm</u>() and <u>sleep</u>() functions.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Many historical implementations (including Version 7 and System V) allow an alarm to occur up to a second
       early.   Other  implementations  allow alarms up to half a second or one clock tick early or do not allow
       them to occur early at all.  The  latter  is  considered  most  appropriate,  since  it  gives  the  most
       predictable  behavior, especially since the signal can always be delayed for an indefinite amount of time
       due to scheduling. Applications can thus choose the <u>seconds</u> argument as the minimum amount of  time  they
       wish to have elapse before the signal.

       The  term  ``realtime''  here and elsewhere (<u>sleep</u>(), <u>times</u>()) is intended to mean ``wall clock'' time as
       common English usage, and has nothing to do with ``realtime operating systems''. It  is  in  contrast  to
       <u>virtual</u> <u>time</u>, which could be misinterpreted if just <u>time</u> were used.

       In  some  implementations,  including  4.3  BSD,  very  large values of the <u>seconds</u> argument are silently
       rounded down to an implementation-specific maximum value. This maximum is large enough (to the  order  of
       several months) that the effect is not noticeable.

       There  were  two possible choices for alarm generation in multi-threaded applications: generation for the
       calling thread or generation for the process. The first option would not have  been  particularly  useful
       since  the alarm state is maintained on a per-process basis and the alarm that is established by the last
       invocation of <u>alarm</u>() is the only one that would be active.

       Furthermore, allowing generation of an  asynchronous  signal  for  a  thread  would  have  introduced  an
       exception to the overall signal model. This requires a compelling reason in order to be justified.

       None.
