</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       RDF::TrineX::Serializer::MockTurtleSoup - he's a bit slow, but he's sure good lookin'

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use RDF::TrineX::Serializer::MockTurtleSoup;

        my $ser = "RDF::TrineX::Serializer::MockTurtleSoup"-&gt;new(%opts);
        $ser-&gt;serialize_model_to_file($fh, $model);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Like RDF::Trine::Serializer::Turtle but real pretty.

       And slower.

       And probably breaks with some complex graphs.

   <b>What's</b> <b>so</b> <b>pretty?</b>
       •   Output interesting data first. Output URIs before bnodes. Output rdf:type and rdfs:label before other
           predicates. Allow the user to define criteria for what nodes are "interesting".

       •   Use QNames for predicates, classes and datatypes, use full URIs elsewhere. But also allow the user to
           supply a list of additional URIs that will be abbreviated to QNames:

            "RDF::TrineX::Serializer::MockTurtleSoup"-&gt;new(
               abbreviate =&gt; [
                  qr{^<a href="http://ontologi">http://ontologi</a>\.es/},
                  qr{^<a href="http://purl">http://purl</a>\.org/},
                  "<a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>",
               ],
            );

       •   Generate  those QNames using RDF::Prefixes because it generates awesome prefixes. (Better than "ns1",
           "ns2", etc.)

       •   When data is equally interesting, sort alphabetically by subject, predicate and object. When  sorting
           by predicate, sort by the predicate's QName, not its full URI.

       •   Compact Turtle list syntax (mostly stolen from Greg's RDF::Trine::Serializer::Turtle)

       •   Inline simple bnodes.

       •   Indent nicely.

   <b>Options</b>
       The constructor supports the following options:

       "abbreviate"
           This  option  will be used as the right-hand side of a smart match to test URIs to see if they should
           be abbreviated to QNames.

           URIs used as predicates or as the object of rdf:type triples  are  always  abbreviated  anyway.  URIs
           which cannot be abbreviated to a legal QName will just be output as URIs.

       "apostrophe"
           Boolean;  if  true,  then  the serializer will sometimes quote literals with an apostrophe instead of
           double-quote marks. This is allowed by recent versions of the Turtle  spec,  but  was  disallowed  by
           earlier specifications, and not widely supported yet. Defaults to false.

       "colspace"
           This  allows  your  predicate-object  pairs  to  line up as nice columns. The smaller the number, the
           closer they get. Default is 20.

       "encoding"
           Either "ascii" or "utf8". Default is "utf8".

       "indent"
           A whitespace string to indent by. The default is one tab character.  (God's chosen indentation.)

       "labelling"
           This option will be used as the right-hand side  of  a  smart  match  to  determine  which  URIs  are
           considered     to     be     equivalent     to     "rdfs:label".      The     default     is     just
           "<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema">http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema</a>#label".

       "namespaces"
           A hashref of prefix =&gt; URI pairs to define preferred QName prefixes.   There  is  no  guarantee  that
           these  will  be honoured, but they usually will. RDF::Prefixes does a damn good job without any help,
           so this is generally pretty unnecessary.

       "priorities"
           If defined, must be a coderef. The coderef will be  called  with  arguments:  the  serializer  object
           itself, a node and the RDF::Trine::Model being serialized.

           The  coderef  can  use data within the model to determine how "interesting" the node is. High numbers
           are very interesting. Negitive numbers are very boring.

           Interesting nodes are more likely to appear earlier on in the output.

           Default is undef.

       "repeats"
           Boolean. If false (the default), will output data like:

            &lt;<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>&gt;
               dc:title "Cat"@en, "Chat"@fr.

           If true, will output data like:

            &lt;<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>&gt;
               dc:title "Cat"@en;
               dc:title "Chat"@fr.

   <b>Methods</b>
       This module provides the same API as RDF::Trine::Serializer.
