</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication - Authentication framework for CGI::Application

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        package MyCGIApp;

        use base qw(CGI::Application); # make sure this occurs before you load the plugin

        use CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication;

        MyCGIApp-&gt;authen-&gt;config(
              DRIVER =&gt; [ 'Generic', { user1 =&gt; '123' } ],
        );
        MyCGIApp-&gt;authen-&gt;protected_runmodes('myrunmode');

        sub myrunmode {
           my $self = shift;

           # The user should be logged in if we got here
           my $username = $self-&gt;authen-&gt;username;

        }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication adds the ability to authenticate users in your CGI::Application
       modules.  It imports one method called 'authen' into your CGI::Application module.  Through the authen
       method you can call all the methods of the CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication plugin.

       There are two main decisions that you need to make when using this module.  How will the usernames and
       password be verified (i.e. from a database, LDAP, etc...), and how can we keep the knowledge that a user
       has already logged in persistent, so that they will not have to enter their credentials again on the next
       request (i.e. how do we 'Store' the authentication information across requests).

   <b>Choosing</b> <b>a</b> <b>Driver</b>
       There are three drivers that are included with the distribution.  Also, there is built in support for all
       of the Authen::Simple modules (search CPAN for Authen::Simple for more information).  This should be
       enough to cover everyone's needs.

       If you need to authenticate against a source that is not provided, you can use the Generic driver which
       will accept either a hash of username/password pairs, or an array of arrays of credentials, or a
       subroutine reference that can verify the credentials.  So through the Generic driver you should be able
       to write your own verification system.  There is also a Dummy driver, which blindly accepts any
       credentials (useful for testing).  See the CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Driver::Generic,
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Driver::DBI and,
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Driver::Dummy docs for more information on how to use these
       drivers.  And see the Authen::Simple suite of modules for information on those drivers.

   <b>Choosing</b> <b>a</b> <b>Store</b>
       The Store modules keep information about the authentication status of the user persistent across multiple
       requests.  The information that is stored in the store include the username, and the expiry time of the
       login.  There are two Store modules included with this distribution.  A Session based store, and a Cookie
       based store.  If your application is already using Sessions (through the
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Session module), then I would recommend that you use the Session store for
       authentication.  If you are not using the Session plugin, then you can use the Cookie store.  The Cookie
       store keeps all the authentication in a cookie, which contains a checksum to ensure that users can not
       change the information.

       If you do not specify which Store module you wish to use, the plugin will try to determine the best one
       for you.

   <b>Login</b> <b>page</b>
       The Authentication plugin comes with a default login page that can be used if you do not want to create a
       custom login page.  This login form will automatically be used if you do not provide either a LOGIN_URL
       or LOGIN_RUNMODE parameter in the configuration.  If you plan to create your own login page, I would
       recommend that you start with the HTML code for the default login page, so that your login page will
       contain the correct form fields and hidden fields.

   <b>Ticket</b> <b>based</b> <b>authentication</b>
       This Authentication plugin can handle ticket based authentication systems as well.  All that is required
       of you is to write a Store module that can understand the contents of the ticket.  The Authentication
       plugin will require at least the 'username' to be retrieved from the ticket.  A Ticket based
       authentication scheme will not need a Driver module at all, since the actual verification of credentials
       is done by an external authentication system, possibly even on a different host.  You will need to
       specify the location of the login page using the LOGIN_URL configuration variable, and unauthenticated
       users will automatically be redirected to your ticket authentication login page.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTED</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>authen</b>
       This is the only method exported from this module.  Everything is controlled through this method call,
       which will return a CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication object, or just the class name if called as
       a class method.  When using the plugin, you will always first call $self-&gt;authen or __PACKAGE__-&gt;authen
       and then the method you wish to invoke.  For example:

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;authen-&gt;config(
               LOGIN_RUNMODE =&gt; 'login',
         );

       - or -

         $self-&gt;authen-&gt;protected_runmodes(qw(one two));

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>config</b>
       This method is used to configure the CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication module.  It can be called
       as an object method, or as a class method. Calling this function, will not itself generate cookies or
       session ids.

       The following parameters are accepted:

       DRIVER
           Here  you  can  choose  which authentication module(s) you want to use to perform the authentication.
           For simplicity, you can leave off the  CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Driver::  part  when
           specifying the DRIVER name  If this module requires extra parameters, you can pass an array reference
           that  contains as the first parameter the name of the module, and the rest of the values in the array
           will be considered options for the driver.  You can provide multiple drivers which will be  used,  in
           order, to check the credentials until a valid response is received.

                DRIVER =&gt; 'Dummy' # let anyone in regardless of the password

             - or -

                DRIVER =&gt; [ 'DBI',
                    DBH         =&gt; $self-&gt;dbh,
                    TABLE       =&gt; 'user',
                    CONSTRAINTS =&gt; {
                        'user.name'         =&gt; '__CREDENTIAL_1__',
                        'MD5:user.password' =&gt; '__CREDENTIAL_2__'
                    },
                ],

             - or -

                DRIVER =&gt; [
                    [ 'Generic', { user1 =&gt; '123' } ],
                    [ 'Generic', sub { my ($u, $p) = @_; is_prime($p) ? 1 : 0 } ]
                ],

             - or -

                DRIVER =&gt; [ 'Authen::Simple::LDAP',
                    host   =&gt; 'ldap.company.com',
                    basedn =&gt; 'ou=People,dc=company,dc=net'
                ],

       STORE
           Here  you  can choose how we store the authenticated information after a user has successfully logged
           in.  We need to store the username so that on the next request we  can  tell  the  user  has  already
           logged  in,  and  we  do not have to present them with another login form.  If you do not provide the
           STORE option, then the plugin will look to see if you are using the CGI::Application::Plugin::Session
           module and based on that info use either the Session module, or fall back on the Cookie  module.   If
           the  module  requires  extra  parameters,  you can pass an array reference that contains as the first
           parameter the name of the module, and the rest of the array should contain key value pairs of options
           for     this     module.      These     storage     modules     generally     live     under      the
           CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Store::  name-space,  and this part of the package name can
           be left off when specifying the STORE parameter.

               STORE =&gt; 'Session'

             - or -

               STORE =&gt; ['Cookie',
                   NAME   =&gt; 'MYAuthCookie',
                   SECRET =&gt; 'FortyTwo',
                   EXPIRY =&gt; '1d',
               ]

       POST_LOGIN_RUNMODE
           Here you can specify a runmode that the user will be redirected to if they successfully login.

             POST_LOGIN_RUNMODE =&gt; 'welcome'

       POST_LOGIN_URL
           Here you can specify a URL that the user will be redirected to if they successfully login.   If  both
           POST_LOGIN_URL and POST_LOGIN_RUNMODE are specified, then the latter will take precedence.

             POST_LOGIN_URL =&gt; '<a href="http://example.com/start.cgi">http://example.com/start.cgi</a>'

       POST_LOGIN_CALLBACK
           A code reference that is executed after login processing but before POST_LOGIN_RUNMODE or redirecting
           to  POST_LOGIN_URL.  This  is  normally a method in your CGI::Application application and as such the
           CGI::Application object is passed as a parameter.

             POST_LOGIN_CALLBACK =&gt; \&amp;update_login_date

           and later in your code:

             sub update_login_date {
               my $self = shift;

               return unless($self-&gt;authen-&gt;is_authenticated);

               ...
             }

       LOGIN_RUNMODE
           Here you can specify a runmode that the user will be redirected to if they need to login.

             LOGIN_RUNMODE =&gt; 'login'

       LOGIN_URL
           If your login page is external to this module, then you can use this option to specify a URL that the
           user will be redirected to when  they  need  to  login.  If  both  LOGIN_URL  and  LOGIN_RUNMODE  are
           specified, then the latter will take precedence.

             LOGIN_URL =&gt; '<a href="http://example.com/login.cgi">http://example.com/login.cgi</a>'

       LOGOUT_RUNMODE
           Here you can specify a runmode that the user will be redirected to if they ask to logout.

             LOGOUT_RUNMODE =&gt; 'logout'

       LOGOUT_URL
           If  your  logout  page is external to this module, then you can use this option to specify a URL that
           the user will be redirected to when they ask to logout.  If both LOGOUT_URL  and  LOGOUT_RUNMODE  are
           specified, then the latter will take precedence.

             LOGIN_URL =&gt; '<a href="http://example.com/logout.html">http://example.com/logout.html</a>'

       DETAINT_URL_REGEXP
           This  is  a regular expression used to detaint URLs used in the login form. By default it will be set
           to

             ^([\w\_\%\?\&amp;\;\-\/\@\.\+\$\=\#\:\!\*\"\'\(\)\,]+)$

           This regular expression is based upon the document <a href="http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/url-spec.txt">http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/url-spec.txt</a>. You
           could set it to a more specific regular expression to limit the  domains  to  which  users  could  be
           directed.

       DETAINT_USERNAME_REGEXP
           This  is  a  regular  expression  used  to  detaint the username parameter used in the login form. By
           default it will be set to

             ^([\w\_]+)$

       CREDENTIALS
           Set this to the list of form fields where the user will type in  their  username  and  password.   By
           default this is set to ['authen_username', 'authen_password'].  The form field names should be set to
           a  value  that  you  are not likely to use in any other forms.  This is important because this plugin
           will automatically look for query parameters that match these values on every request  to  see  if  a
           user  is trying to log in.  So if you use the same parameter names on a user management page, you may
           inadvertently perform a login when that was not intended.  Most of the Driver modules will return the
           first CREDENTIAL as the username, so make sure that you list the username field first.   This  option
           can be ignored if you use the built in login box

             CREDENTIALS =&gt; 'authen_password'

             - or -

             CREDENTIALS =&gt; [ 'authen_username', 'authen_domain', 'authen_password' ]

       LOGIN_SESSION_TIMEOUT
           This  option  can  be used to tell the system when to force the user to re-authenticate.  There are a
           few different possibilities that can all be used concurrently:

           IDLE_FOR
               If this value is set, a re-authentication will be forced if the user was idle  for  more  then  x
               amount of time.

           EVERY
               If this value is set, a re-authentication will be forced every x amount of time.

           CUSTOM
               This  value can be set to a subroutine reference that returns true if the session should be timed
               out, and false if it is still active.  This can allow you to be  very  selective  about  how  the
               timeout system works.  The authen object will be passed in as the only parameter.

           Time  values  are  specified  in  seconds.  You  can also specify the time by using a number with the
           following suffixes (m h d w), which represent minutes, hours, days and weeks.  The default is 0 which
           means the login will never timeout.

           Note that the login is also dependent on the type of STORE that is used.  If  the  Session  store  is
           used,  and the session expires, then the login will also automatically expire.  The same goes for the
           Cookie store.

           For backwards compatibility, if you set LOGIN_SESSION_TIMEOUT to a time value instead of  a  hashref,
           it will be treated as an IDLE_FOR time out.

             # force re-authentication if idle for more than 15 minutes
             LOGIN_SESSION_TIMEOUT =&gt; '15m'

             # Everyone must re-authentication if idle for more than 30 minutes
             # also, everyone must re-authentication at least once a day
             # and root must re-authentication if idle for more than 5 minutes
             LOGIN_SESSION_TIMEOUT =&gt; {
                   IDLE_FOR =&gt; '30m',
                   EVERY    =&gt; '1d',
                   CUSTOM   =&gt; sub {
                     my $authen = shift;
                     return ($authen-&gt;username eq 'root' &amp;&amp; (time() - $authen-&gt;last_access) &gt; 300) ? 1 : 0;
                   }
             }

       RENDER_LOGIN
           This value can be set to a subroutine reference that returns the HTML of a login form. The subroutine
           reference  overrides  the  default  call  to  login_box.  The subroutine is normally a method in your
           CGI::Application application and  as  such  the  CGI::Application  object  is  passed  as  the  first
           parameter.

             RENDER_LOGIN =&gt; \&amp;login_form

           and later in your code:

             sub login_form {
               my $self = shift;

               ...
               return $html
             }

       LOGIN_FORM
           You  can  set  this  option  to  customize  the  login  form  that is created when a user needs to be
           authenticated.  If you wish to replace the entire login form with a completely custom  version,  then
           just set LOGIN_RUNMODE to point to your custom runmode.

           All of the parameters listed below are optional, and a reasonable default will be used if left blank:

           DISPLAY_CLASS (default: Classic)
               the  class  used  to  display  the  login  form.  The alternative is "Basic" which aims for XHTML
               compliance and leaving style to CSS.  See  CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Display  for
               more details.

           TITLE (default: Sign In)
               the heading at the top of the login box

           USERNAME_LABEL (default: User Name)
               the label for the user name input

           PASSWORD_LABEL (default: Password)
               the label for the password input

           SUBMIT_LABEL (default: Sign In)
               the label for the submit button

           COMMENT (default: Please enter your username and password in the fields below.)
               a message provided on the first login attempt

           REMEMBERUSER_OPTION (default: 1)
               provide  a  checkbox to offer to remember the users name in a cookie so that their user name will
               be pre-filled the next time they log in

           REMEMBERUSER_LABEL (default: Remember User Name)
               the label for the remember user name checkbox

           REMEMBERUSER_COOKIENAME (default: CAPAUTHTOKEN)
               the name of the cookie where the user name will be saved

           REGISTER_URL (default: &lt;none&gt;)
               the URL for the register new account link

           REGISTER_LABEL (default: Register Now!)
               the label for the register new account link

           FORGOTPASSWORD_URL (default: &lt;none&gt;)
               the URL for the forgot password link

           FORGOTPASSWORD_LABEL (default: Forgot Password?)
               the label for the forgot password link

           INVALIDPASSWORD_MESSAGE (default: Invalid username or password&lt;br /&gt;(login attempt %d)
               a message given when a login failed

           INCLUDE_STYLESHEET (default: 1)
               use this to disable the built in style-sheet for the login box so you can provide your own custom
               styles

           FORM_SUBMIT_METHOD (default: post)
               use this to get the form to submit using 'get' instead of 'post'

           FOCUS_FORM_ONLOAD (default: 1)
               use this to automatically focus the login form when the page loads so a  user  can  start  typing
               right away.

           BASE_COLOUR (default: #445588)
               This  is  the  base  colour  that  will be used in the included login box.  All other colours are
               automatically calculated based on this colour (unless you hardcode the colour values).  In  order
               to  calculate  other  colours,  you  will  need  the  Color::Calc module.  If you do not have the
               Color::Calc module, then you will need to use fixed values for all of the  colour  options.   All
               colour  values  besides  the  BASE_COLOUR can be simple percentage values (including the % sign).
               For example if you set the LIGHTER_COLOUR option to 80%, then the calculated colour will  be  80%
               lighter than the BASE_COLOUR.

           LIGHT_COLOUR (default: 50% or #a2aac4)
               A colour that is lighter than the base colour.

           LIGHTER_COLOUR (default: 75% or #d0d5e1)
               A colour that is another step lighter than the light colour.

           DARK_COLOUR (default: 30% or #303c5f)
               A colour that is darker than the base colour.

           DARKER_COLOUR (default: 60% or #1b2236)
               A colour that is another step darker than the dark colour.

           GREY_COLOUR (default: #565656)
               A grey colour that is calculated by desaturating the base colour.

   <b>protected_runmodes</b>
       This  method  takes  a  list  of runmodes that are to be protected by authentication.  If a user tries to
       access one of these runmodes, then they will be redirected to a  login  page  unless  they  are  properly
       logged in.  The runmode names can be a list of simple strings, regular expressions, or special directives
       that  start  with  a colon.  This method is cumulative, so if it is called multiple times, the new values
       are added to existing entries.  It returns a list of all entries that have been saved  so  far.   Calling
       this function, will not itself generate cookies or session ids.

       :all - All runmodes in this module will require authentication

         # match all runmodes
         __PACKAGE__-&gt;authen-&gt;protected_runmodes(':all');

         # only protect runmodes one two and three
         __PACKAGE__-&gt;authen-&gt;protected_runmodes(qw(one two three));

         # protect only runmodes that start with auth_
         __PACKAGE__-&gt;authen-&gt;protected_runmodes(qr/^auth_/);

         # protect all runmodes that *do not* start with public_
         __PACKAGE__-&gt;authen-&gt;protected_runmodes(qr/^(?!public_)/);

   <b>is_protected_runmode</b>
       This method accepts the name of a runmode, and will tell you if that runmode is a protected runmode (i.e.
       does  a  user  need  to be authenticated to access this runmode).  Calling this function, will not itself
       generate cookies or session ids.

   <b>redirect_after_login</b>
       This method is be called during the prerun stage  to  redirect  the  user  to  the  page  that  has  been
       configured as the destination after a successful login.  The location is determined as follows:

       POST_LOGIN_RUNMODE
           If the POST_LOGIN_RUNMODE config parameter is set, that run mode will be the chosen location.

       POST_LOGIN_URL
           If  the  above  fails  and  the  POST_LOGIN_URL  config  parameter  is  set, then there will be a 302
           redirection to that location.

       destination
           If the above fails and there is a destination query parameter, which must a taint check  against  the
           DETAINT_URL_REGEXP config parameter, then there will be a 302 redirection to that location.

       original destination
           If all the above fail then there the originally requested page will be delivered.

   <b>redirect_to_login</b>
       This  method  is  be  called  during  the prerun stage if the current user is not logged in, and they are
       trying to access a protected runmode.  It will redirect to the page that has been configured as the login
       page, based on the value of LOGIN_RUNMODE or LOGIN_URL  If nothing is configured a simple login page will
       be automatically provided.

   <b>redirect_to_logout</b>
       This method is called during the prerun stage if the user has  requested  to  be  logged  out.   It  will
       redirect to the page that has been configured as the logout page, based on the value of LOGOUT_RUNMODE or
       LOGOUT_URL  If nothing is configured, the page will redirect to the website homepage.

   <b>setup_runmodes</b>
       This  method  is  called during the prerun stage to register some custom runmodes that the Authentication
       plugin requires in order to function.  Calling this function, will not itself generate cookies or session
       ids.

   <b>last_login</b>
       This will return return the time of the last login for this user

         my $last_login = $self-&gt;authen-&gt;last_login;

       This function will initiate a session or cookie if one has not been created already.

   <b>last_access</b>
       This will return return the time of the last access for this user

         my $last_access = $self-&gt;authen-&gt;last_access;

       This function will initiate a session or cookie if one has not been created already.

   <b>is_login_timeout</b>
       This will return true or false depending on whether the users login status just timed out

         $self-&gt;add_message('login session timed out') if $self-&gt;authen-&gt;is_login_timeout;

       This function will initiate a session or cookie if one has not been created already.

   <b>is_authenticated</b>
       This will return true or false depending on the login status of this user

         assert($self-&gt;authen-&gt;is_authenticated); # The user should be logged in if we got here

       This function will initiate a session or cookie if one has not been created already.

   <b>login_attempts</b>
       This method will return the number of failed login attempts have been made by this user  since  the  last
       successful  login.   This is not a number that can be trusted, as it is dependent on the underlying store
       to be able to return the correct value for this user.  For example, if the  store  uses  a  cookie  based
       session,  the user trying to login could delete their cookies, and hence get a new session which will not
       have any login attempts listed.  The number will be cleared upon a successful login.  This function  will
       initiate a session or cookie if one has not been created already.

   <b>username</b>
       This  will  return  the username of the currently logged in user, or undef if no user is currently logged
       in.

         my $username = $self-&gt;authen-&gt;username;

       This function will initiate a session or cookie if one has not been created already.

   <b>is_new_login</b>
       This will return true or false depending on if this is a fresh login

         $self-&gt;log-&gt;info("New Login") if $self-&gt;authen-&gt;is_new_login;

       This function will initiate a session or cookie if one has not been created already.

   <b>credentials</b>
       This method will return the names of the form parameters that will be looked  for  during  a  login.   By
       default  they  are  authen_username and authen_password, but these values can be changed by supplying the
       CREDENTIALS parameters in the configuration. Calling this function, will not itself generate  cookies  or
       session ids.

   <b>logout</b>
       This  will  attempt  to  logout the user.  If during a request the Authentication module sees a parameter
       called 'authen_logout', it will automatically call this method to log out the user.

         $self-&gt;authen-&gt;logout();

       This function will initiate a session or cookie if one has not been created already.

   <b>drivers</b>
       This method will return a list of driver objects that are  used  for  verifying  the  login  credentials.
       Calling this function, will not itself generate cookies or session ids.

   <b>store</b>
       This  method  will  return  a  store  object  that  is  used to store information about the status of the
       authentication across multiple requests.  This function will initiate a session or cookie if one has  not
       been created already.

   <b>initialize</b>
       This  does  most of the heavy lifting for the Authentication plugin.  It will check to see if the user is
       currently attempting to login by looking for the credential form fields in the  query  object.   It  will
       load  the required driver objects and authenticate the user.  It is OK to call this method multiple times
       as it checks to see if it has already been executed and will just return without doing anything if called
       multiple times.  This allows us to call initialize as  late  as  possible  in  the  request  so  that  no
       unnecessary work is done.

       The  user  will  be  logged out by calling the logout() method if the login session has been idle for too
       long, if it has been too long since the last login, or if the login has timed out.  If you need  to  know
       if a user was logged out because of a time out, you can call the "is_login_timeout" method.

       If all goes well, a true value will be returned, although it is usually not necessary to check.

       This function will initiate a session or cookie if one has not been created already.

   <b>display</b>
       This  method  will  return  the  CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Display  object,  creating and
       caching it if necessary.

   <b>login_box</b>
       This method will return the HTML for a login box that can be embedded into another  page.   This  is  the
       same login box that is used in the default authen_login runmode that the plugin provides.

       This function will initiate a session or cookie if one has not been created already.

   <b>new</b>
       This  method  creates  a  new  CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication object.  It requires as it's only
       parameter a CGI::Application object.  This method should never be called  directly,  since  the  'authen'
       method   that   is   imported   into   the  CGI::Application  module  will  take  care  of  creating  the
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication object when it is required.  Calling  this  function,  will  not
       itself generate cookies or session ids.

   <b>instance</b>
       This  method  works  the same way as 'new', except that it returns the same Authentication object for the
       duration of the request.  This method should never be called directly, since the 'authen' method that  is
       imported     into     the     CGI::Application    module    will    take    care    of    creating    the
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication object when it is required.  Calling  this  function,  will  not
       itself generate cookies or session ids.

</pre><h4><b>CGI::Application</b> <b>CALLBACKS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>prerun_callback</b>
       This  method  is  a CGI::Application prerun callback that will be automatically registered for you if you
       are using CGI::Application 4.0 or greater.  If you are using an older  version  of  CGI::Application  you
       will have to create your own cgiapp_prerun method and make sure you call this method from there.

        sub cgiapp_prerun {
           my $self = shift;

           $self-&gt;CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::prerun_callback();
        }

</pre><h4><b>CGI::Application</b> <b>RUNMODES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>authen_login_runmode</b>
       This  runmode  is provided if you do not want to create your own login runmode.  It will display a simple
       login form for the user, which can be replaced by assigning RENDER_LOGIN a coderef that returns the HTML.

   <b>authen_dummy_redirect</b>
       This runmode is provided for convenience when an external redirect needs to be done.  It just returns  an
       empty string.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       In a CGI::Application module:

         use base qw(CGI::Application);
         use CGI::Application::Plugin::AutoRunmode;
         use CGI::Application::Plugin::Session;
         use CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication;

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;authen-&gt;config(
               DRIVER         =&gt; [ 'Generic', { user1 =&gt; '123' } ],
               STORE          =&gt; 'Session',
               LOGOUT_RUNMODE =&gt; 'start',
         );
         __PACKAGE__-&gt;authen-&gt;protected_runmodes(qr/^auth_/, 'one');

         sub start : RunMode {
           my $self = shift;

         }

         sub one : RunMode {
           my $self = shift;

           # The user will only get here if they are logged in
         }

         sub auth_two : RunMode {
           my $self = shift;

           # This is also protected because of the
           # regexp call to protected_runmodes above
         }

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>CGI::Application::Plugin::ActionDispatch</b></h4><pre>
       The  prerun  callback has been modified so that it will check for the presence of a prerun mode.  This is
       for  compatibility  with  CGI::Application::Plugin::ActionDispatch.  This  change  should  be  considered
       experimental.  It is necessary to load the ActionDispatch module so that the two prerun callbacks will be
       called in the correct order.

</pre><h4><b>RECOMMENDED</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       CSS The best practice nowadays is generally considered to be to not have CSS embedded in  HTML.  Thus  it
           should be best to set LOGIN_FORM -&gt; DISPLAY_CLASS to 'Basic'.

       Post login destination
           Of  the  various  means  of  selecting  a  post  login  destination  the most secure would seem to be
           POST_LOGIN_URL.  The  "destination"  parameter  could  potentially  be  hijacked  by  hackers.    The
           POST_LOGIN_RUNMODE parameter requires a hidden parameter that could potentially be hijacked.

       Taint mode
           Do  run  your  code  under  taint  mode.  It should help protect your application against a number of
           attacks.

       URL and username checking
           Please set the "DETAINT_URL_REGEXP" and "DETAINT_USERNAME_REGEXP" parameters as tightly as  possible.
           In particular you should prevent the destination parameter being used to redirect authenticated users
           to  external sites; unless of course that is what you want in which case that site should be the only
           possible external site.

       The login form
           The HTML currently generated does not seem to be standards compliant as per RT bug  58023.  Also  the
           default  login  form  includes  hidden  forms which could conceivably be hijacked.  Set LOGIN_FORM -&gt;
           DISPLAY_CLASS to 'Basic' to fix this.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       There are lots of things that can still be done to improve this plugin.  If anyone else is interested  in
       helping  out  feel  free  to  dig right in.  Many of these things don't need my input, but if you want to
       avoid duplicated efforts, send me a note, and I'll let you know of anyone else is  working  in  the  same
       area.

       review the code for security bugs and report
       complete the separation of presentation and logic
       write a tutorial
       build more Drivers (Class::DBI, LDAP, Radius, etc...)
       Add support for method attributes to identify runmodes that require authentication
       finish the test suite
       provide more example code
       clean up the documentation
       build a DB driver that builds it's own table structure.  This can be used by people that don't have their
       own user database to work with, and could include a simple user management application.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  alpha  software and as such, the features and interface are subject to change.  So please check
       the Changes file when upgrading.

       Some of the test scripts appear to be incompatible with versions of Devel::Cover later than 0.65.
