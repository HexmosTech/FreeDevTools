       int <u>status</u> (in)                       Provides  information  about  why the application or thread exited.
                                             Exact meaning may be platform-specific.  0 usually means  a  normal
                                             exit, any nonzero value usually means that an error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  procedures  described  here  provide a graceful mechanism to end the execution of a <b>Tcl</b> application.
       Exit handlers are invoked to cleanup the application's state before ending the execution of <b>Tcl</b> code.

       Invoke <b>Tcl_Exit</b> to end a <b>Tcl</b> application and to exit from this process. This procedure is invoked by  the
       <b>exit</b>  Tcl  command,  and  can  be invoked anyplace else to terminate the application.  No-one should ever
       invoke the <b>exit()</b> system call directly;  always invoke <b>Tcl_Exit</b> instead,  so  that  it  can  invoke  exit
       handlers.   Note  that  if  other  code  invokes  <b>exit()</b>  system  call  directly, or otherwise causes the
       application to terminate without  calling  <b>Tcl_Exit</b>,  the  exit  handlers  will  not  be  run.   <b>Tcl_Exit</b>
       internally  invokes  the  <b>exit()</b>  system  call,  thus  it  never  returns  control  to its caller.  If an
       application exit handler has been installed (see  <b>Tcl_SetExitProc</b>),  that  handler  is  invoked  with  an
       argument  consisting  of the exit status (cast to void *); the application exit handler should not return
       control to Tcl.

       <b>Tcl_Finalize</b> is similar to <b>Tcl_Exit</b> except that it does not exit from the current process.  It is  useful
       for  cleaning  up  when a process is finished using <b>Tcl</b> but wishes to continue executing, and when <b>Tcl</b> is
       used in a dynamically loaded extension that is about to be unloaded.   Your  code  should  always  invoke
       <b>Tcl_Finalize</b> when <b>Tcl</b> is being unloaded, to ensure proper cleanup. <b>Tcl_Finalize</b> can be safely called more
       than once.

       <b>Tcl_ExitThread</b>  is  used  to  terminate  the  current  thread  and invoke per-thread exit handlers.  This
       finalization is done by <b>Tcl_FinalizeThread</b>, which you can call if you just want to  clean  up  per-thread
       state  and invoke the thread exit handlers.  <b>Tcl_Finalize</b> calls <b>Tcl_FinalizeThread</b> for the current thread
       automatically.

       <b>Tcl_CreateExitHandler</b>   arranges   for   <u>proc</u>   to   be   invoked   by   <b>Tcl_Finalize</b>    and    <b>Tcl_Exit</b>.
       <b>Tcl_CreateThreadExitHandler</b>  arranges  for  <u>proc</u>  to be invoked by <b>Tcl_FinalizeThread</b> and <b>Tcl_ExitThread</b>.
       This provides a hook for cleanup operations such as flushing buffers and  freeing  global  memory.   <u>Proc</u>
       should match the type <b>Tcl_ExitProc</b>:

              typedef void <b>Tcl_ExitProc</b>(
                      void *<u>clientData</u>);

       The  <u>clientData</u>  parameter to <u>proc</u> is a copy of the <u>clientData</u> argument given to <b>Tcl_CreateExitHandler</b> or
       <b>Tcl_CreateThreadExitHandler</b> when the callback was  created.   Typically,  <u>clientData</u>  points  to  a  data
       structure containing application-specific information about what to do in <u>proc</u>.

       <b>Tcl_DeleteExitHandler</b>  and  <b>Tcl_DeleteThreadExitHandler</b> may be called to delete a previously-created exit
       handler.  It removes the handler indicated by <u>proc</u> and <u>clientData</u> so that no call to <u>proc</u> will  be  made.
       If no such handler exists then <b>Tcl_DeleteExitHandler</b> or <b>Tcl_DeleteThreadExitHandler</b> does nothing.

       <b>Tcl_Finalize</b>  and <b>Tcl_Exit</b> execute all registered exit handlers, in reverse order from the order in which
       they were registered.  This matches the natural order in which extensions are  loaded  and  unloaded;  if
       extension  <b>A</b>  loads  extension  <b>B</b>,  it  usually  unloads  <b>B</b> before it itself is unloaded.  If extension <b>A</b>
       registers its exit handlers before loading extension <b>B</b>, this ensures that any exit handlers for <b>B</b> will be
       executed before the exit handlers for <b>A</b>.

       <b>Tcl_Finalize</b> and <b>Tcl_Exit</b> call <b>Tcl_FinalizeThread</b> and the thread exit  handlers  <u>after</u>  the  process-wide
       exit  handlers.  This is because thread finalization shuts down the I/O channel system, so any attempt at
       I/O by the global exit handlers will vanish into the bitbucket.

       <b>Tcl_SetExitProc</b> installs an application exit handler, returning the previously-installed application exit
       handler or NULL if no application handler was installed.  If an application exit  handler  is  installed,
       that  exit  handler  takes  over  complete  responsibility  for  finalization  of  Tcl's  subsystems  via
       <b>Tcl_Finalize</b> at an appropriate time.  The argument passed to <u>proc</u> when it is invoked  will  be  the  exit
       status code (as passed to <b>Tcl_Exit</b>) cast to a void *value.

       <b>Tcl_SetExitProc</b> can not be used in stub-enabled extensions.
