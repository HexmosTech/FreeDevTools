</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       REST::Application::Routes - An implementation of Ruby on Rails type routes.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package MyApp;
           use base 'REST::Application::Routes';

           my $obj = REST::Application::Routes-&gt;new();
           $obj-&gt;loadResource(
               '/data/workspaces/:ws/pages/:page', =&gt; \&amp;do_thing,
               # ... other routes here ...
           );

           sub do_thing {
               my %vars = @_;
               print $vars{ws} . " " . $vars{page} . "\n";
           }

           # Now, in some other place.  Maybe a CGI file or an Apache handler, do:
           use MyApp;
           MyApp-&gt;new-&gt;run("/data/workspaces/cows/pages/good"); # prints "cows good"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Ruby on Rails has this concept of routes.  Routes are URI path info templates which are tied to specific
       code (i.e. Controllers and Actions in Rails).  That is routes consist of key value pairs, called the
       route map, where the key is the path info template and the value is a code reference.

       A template is of the form: "/foo/:variable/bar" where variables are always prefaced with a colon.  When a
       given path is passed to "run()" the code reference which the template maps to will be passed a hash where
       the keys are the variable names (sans colon) and the values are what was specified in place of the
       variables.

       The route map is ordered, so the most specific matching template is used and so you should order your
       templates from least generic to most generic.

       See REST::Application for details.  The only difference between this module and that one is that this one
       uses URI templates as keys in the "resourceHooks" rather than regexes.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       These are methods which REST::Application::Routes has but its superclass does not.

   <b>getTemplateVars()</b>
       Returns a hash whose keys are the ":symbols" from the URI template and whose values are what where
       matched to be there.  It is assumed that this method is called either from within or after
       "loadResource()" is called.  Otherwise you're likely to get an empty hash back.

   <b>getLastMatchTemplate()</b>
       This is an alias for "getLastMatchPattern()", since this class is about templates rather than regexes.
