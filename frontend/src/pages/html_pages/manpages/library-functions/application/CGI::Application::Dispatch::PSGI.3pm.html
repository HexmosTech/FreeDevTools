</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI - Dispatch requests to CGI::Application based objects using PSGI

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Box</b>
       Under mod_perl:

         # change "Apache1" to "Apache2" as needed.

         &lt;Location /&gt;
         SetHandler perl-script
         PerlHandler Plack::Handler::Apache1
         PerlSetVar psgi_app /path/to/app.psgi
         &lt;/Location&gt;

         &lt;Perl&gt;
         use Plack::Handler::Apache1;
         Plack::Handler::Apache1-&gt;preload("/path/to/app.psgi");
         &lt;/Perl&gt;

       Under CGI:

       This would be the instance script for your application, such as /cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi:

           ### in your dispatch.psgi:
           # ( in a persistent environment, use FindBin::Real instead. )
           use FindBin 'Bin';
           use lib "$Bin/../perllib';
           use Your::Application::Dispatch;
           Your::Application::Dispatch-&gt;as_psgi;

           ### In Your::Application::Dispatch;
           package Your::Application::Dispatch;
           use base 'CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI';

   <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispatch</b> <b>table</b>
           package MyApp::Dispatch;
           use base 'CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI';

           sub dispatch_args {
               return {
                   prefix  =&gt; 'MyApp',
                   table   =&gt; [
                       ''                =&gt; { app =&gt; 'Welcome', rm =&gt; 'start' },
                       ':app/:rm'        =&gt; { },
                       'admin/:app/:rm'  =&gt; { prefix   =&gt; 'MyApp::Admin' },
                   ],
               };
           }

       The ".psgi" file is constructed as above.

   <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>custom</b> <b>query</b> <b>object</b>
       If you want to supply your own PSGI object, something like this in your .psgi file will work:

           sub {
               my $env = shift;
               my $app = CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI-&gt;as_psgi(
                   table =&gt; [
                       '/:rm'    =&gt;    { app =&gt; 'TestApp' }
                   ],
                   args_to_new =&gt; {
                       QUERY    =&gt; CGI::PSGI-&gt;new($env)
                   }
               );
               return $app-&gt;($env);
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a way to look at the path (as returned by "$env-&gt;{PATH_INFO}") of the incoming
       request, parse off the desired module and its run mode, create an instance of that module and run it.

       It will translate a URI like this (in a persistent environment)

           /app/module_name/run_mode

       or this (vanilla CGI)

           /app/index.cgi/module_name/run_mode

       into something that will be functionally similar to this

           my $app = Module::Name-&gt;new(..);
           $app-&gt;mode_param(sub {'run_mode'}); #this will set the run mode

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>as_psgi(%args)</b>
       This is the primary method used during dispatch.

           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>
           use strict;
           use CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI;

           CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI-&gt;as_psgi(
               prefix  =&gt; 'MyApp',
               default =&gt; 'module_name',
           );

       This method accepts the following name value pairs:

       default
           Specify  a  value to use for the path if one is not available.  This could be the case if the default
           page is selected (eg: "/" ).

       prefix
           This option will set the string that will be prepended to the name of the application  module  before
           it is loaded and created. So to use our previous example request of

               /app/index.cgi/module_name/run_mode

           This  would by default load and create a module named 'Module::Name'. But let's say that you have all
           of your application specific modules under the 'My' namespace. If you set this option to 'My' then it
           would instead load the 'My::Module::Name' application module instead.

       args_to_new
           This is a hash of arguments that are passed into the "new()" constructor of the application.

       table
           In most cases, simply using Dispatch with the "default" and  "prefix"  is  enough  to  simplify  your
           application  and  your  URLs,  but there are many cases where you want more power. Enter the dispatch
           table. Since this table can be slightly complicated, a whole section exists on its  use.  Please  see
           the "DISPATCH TABLE" section.

       debug
           Set to a true value to send debugging output for this module to STDERR. Off by default.

       auto_rest
           This  tells  Dispatch that you are using REST by default and that you care about which HTTP method is
           being used. Dispatch will append the HTTP method name (upper case by default) to the run mode that is
           determined after finding the appropriate dispatch  rule.  So  a  GET  request  that  translates  into
           "MyApp::Module-&gt;foo" will become "MyApp::Module-&gt;foo_GET".

           This can be overridden on a per-rule basis in a custom dispatch table.

       auto_rest_lc
           In  combinaion  with auto_rest this tells Dispatch that you prefer lower cased HTTP method names.  So
           instead of "foo_POST" and "foo_GET" you'll have "foo_post" and "foo_get".

   <b>dispatch_args()</b>
       Returns a hashref of args that will be passed to dispatch(). It will return the  following  structure  by
       default.

           {
               prefix      =&gt; '',
               args_to_new =&gt; {},
               table       =&gt; [
                   ':app'      =&gt; {},
                   ':app/:rm'  =&gt; {},
               ],
           }

       This is the perfect place to override when creating a subclass to provide a richer dispatch table.

       When called, it receives 1 argument, which is a reference to the hash of args passed into dispatch.

   <b>translate_module_name($input)</b>
       This  method  is  used to control how the module name is translated from the matching section of the path
       (see "Path Parsing".  The main reason that this method exists is so that  it  can  be  overridden  if  it
       doesn't do exactly what you want.

       The following transformations are performed on the input:

       The text is split on '_'s (underscores) and each word has its first letter capitalized. The words are
       then joined back together and each instance of an underscore is replaced by '::'.
       The text is split on '-'s (hyphens) and each word has its first letter capitalized. The words are then
       joined back together and each instance of a hyphen removed.

       Here are some examples to make it even clearer:

           module_name         =&gt; Module::Name
           module-name         =&gt; ModuleName
           admin_top-scores    =&gt; Admin::TopScores

   <b>require_module($module_name)</b>
       This  class  method is used internally to take a module name (supplied by get_module_name) and require it
       in a secure fashion. It is provided as a public class method so that if you override other  functionality
       of  this module, you can still safely require user specified modules. If there are any problems requiring
       the named module, then we will "croak".

           CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI-&gt;require_module('MyApp::Module::Name');

</pre><h4><b>DISPATCH</b> <b>TABLE</b></h4><pre>
       Sometimes it's easiest to explain with an example, so here you go:

         CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI-&gt;as_psgi(
           prefix      =&gt; 'MyApp',
           args_to_new =&gt; {
               TMPL_PATH =&gt; 'myapp/templates'
           },
           table       =&gt; [
               ''                         =&gt; { app =&gt; 'Blog', rm =&gt; 'recent'},
               'posts/:category'          =&gt; { app =&gt; 'Blog', rm =&gt; 'posts' },
               ':app/:rm/:id'             =&gt; { app =&gt; 'Blog' },
               'date/:year/:month?/:day?' =&gt; {
                   app         =&gt; 'Blog',
                   rm          =&gt; 'by_date',
                   args_to_new =&gt; { TMPL_PATH =&gt; "events/" },
               },
           ]
         );

       So first, this call to as_psgi sets the prefix and passes a "TMPL_PATH" into args_to_new.  Next  it  sets
       the table.

   <b>VOCABULARY</b>
       Just so we all understand what we're talking about....

       A  table  is an array where the elements are gouped as pairs (similar to a hash's key-value pairs, but as
       an array to preserve order). The first element of each pair is called a "rule". The second element in the
       pair is called the rule's "arg list".  Inside a rule there are slashes "/". Anything  set  of  characters
       between slashes is called a "token".

   <b>URL</b> <b>MATCHING</b>
       When  a URL comes in, Dispatch tries to match it against each rule in the table in the order in which the
       rules are given. The first one to match wins.

       A rule consists of slashes and tokens. A token can one of the following types:

       literal
           Any token which does not start with a colon (":") is taken to be a literal  string  and  must  appear
           exactly as-is in the URL in order to match. In the rule

               'posts/:category'

           "posts" is a literal token.

       variable
           Any  token  which  begins  with  a  colon (":") is a variable token. These are simply wild-card place
           holders in the rule that will match anything in the URL that isn't a slash. These variables can later
           be referred to by using the "$self-&gt;param" mechanism. In the rule

               'posts/:category'

           ":category" is a variable token. If the URL matched this rule, then you could the value of that token
           from whithin your application like so:

               my $category = $self-&gt;param('category');

           There are some variable tokens which are  special.  These  can  be  used  to  further  customize  the
           dispatching.

           :app
               This  is  the  module  name  of  the  application.  The  value  of this token will be sent to the
               translate_module_name method and then prefixed with the prefix if there is one.

           :rm This is the run mode of the application. The value of this token will be the actual name  of  the
               run mode used. The run mode can be optional, as noted below. Example:

                   /foo/:rm?

               If  no  run  mode  is  found,  it  will  default  to using the "start_mode()", just like invoking
               CGI::Application directly. Both of these  URLs  would  end  up  dispatching  to  the  start  mode
               associated with /foo:

                   /foo/
                   /foo

       optional-variable
           Any token which begins with a colon (":") and ends with a question mark (&lt;?&gt;) is considered optional.
           If  the rest of the URL matches the rest of the rule, then it doesn't matter whether it contains this
           token or not. It's best to only include optional-variable tokens at the end of your rule. In the rule

               'date/:year/:month?/:day?'

           ":month?" and ":day?" are optional-variable tokens.

           Just like with variable tokens, optional-variable  tokens'  values  can  also  be  retrieved  by  the
           application, if they existed in the URL.

               if( defined $self-&gt;param('month') ) {
                   ...
               }

       wildcard
           The wildcard token "*" allows for partial matches. The token MUST appear at the end of the rule.

             'posts/list/*'

           By  default,  the "dispatch_url_remainder" param is set to the remainder of the URL matched by the *.
           The name of the param can be changed by setting "*" argument in the "ARG LIST".

             'posts/list/*' =&gt; { '*' =&gt; 'post_list_filter' }

       method
           You can also dispatch based on HTTP method. This is similar to using auto_rest but offers  more  fine
           grained  control.  You include the method (case insensitive) at the end of the rule and enclose it in
           square brackets.

             ':app/news[post]'   =&gt; { rm =&gt; 'add_news'    },
             ':app/news[get]'    =&gt; { rm =&gt; 'news'        },
             ':app/news[delete]' =&gt; { rm =&gt; 'delete_news' },

       The main reason that we don't use regular expressions for dispatch  rules  is  that  regular  expressions
       provide no mechanism for named back references, like variable tokens do.

   <b>ARG</b> <b>LIST</b>
       Each  rule  can  have an accompanying arg-list. This arg list can contain special arguments that override
       something set higher up in dispatch for  this  particular  URL,  or  just  have  additional  args  passed
       available in "$self-&gt;param()"

       For instance, if you want to override prefix for a specific rule, then you can do so.

           'admin/:app/:rm' =&gt; { prefix =&gt; 'MyApp::Admin' },

</pre><h4><b>Path</b> <b>Parsing</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  will  describe  how the application module and run mode are determined from the path if no
       "DISPATCH TABLE" is present, and what options you have to customize the process.  The value for the  path
       to be parsed is retrieved from "$env-&gt;{PATH_INFO}".

   <b>Getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>module</b> <b>name</b>
       To  get  the name of the application module the path is split on backslahes ("/").  The second element of
       the returned list (the first is empty) is used to create the application module. So if we have a path of

           /module_name/mode1

       then the string 'module_name' is used. This is passed through the translate_module_name method.  Then  if
       there is a "prefix" (and there should always be a prefix) it is added to the beginning of this new module
       name with a double colon "::" separating the two.

       If  you  don't  like the exact way that this is done, don't fret you do have a couple of options.  First,
       you can specify a "DISPATCH TABLE" which is much  more  powerful  and  flexible  (in  fact  this  default
       behavior  is  actually  implemented internally with a dispatch table).  Or if you want something a little
       simpler, you can simply subclass and extend the translate_module_name method.

   <b>Getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>mode</b>
       Just like the module name is retrieved from splitting the path on slashes,  so  is  the  run  mode.  Only
       instead  of  using  the second element of the resulting list, we use the third as the run mode. So, using
       the same example, if we have a path of

           /module_name/mode2

       Then the string 'mode2' is used as the run mode.

</pre><h4><b>Exception</b> <b>Handling</b></h4><pre>
       A CGI::Application  object  can  throw  an  exception  up  to  "CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI"  if  no
       "error_mode()"  is  implemented  or  if  the  error_mode  itself  throws  an exception. In these cases we
       generally return a generic "500" response, and log some details for the developer with a warning.

       However, we will check to see if the exception thrown is an HTTP::Exception object. If that's  the  case,
       we    will    rethrow    it,    and    you    can    handle    it    yourself    using   something   like
       Plack::Middleware::HTTPExceptions.

</pre><h4><b>MISC</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       •       CGI query strings

               CGI query strings are unaffected by the use of "PATH_INFO" to obtain  the  module  name  and  run
               mode.   This  means  that any other modules you use to get access to you query argument (ie, CGI,
               Apache::Request) should  not  be  affected.  But,  since  the  run  mode  may  be  determined  by
               CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI  having  a  query  argument  named  'rm' will be ignored by your
               application module.

</pre><h4><b>CLEAN</b> <b>URLS</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>MOD_REWRITE</b></h4><pre>
       With a dispatch script, you can fairly clean URLS like this:

        /cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/module_name/run_mode

       However, including "/cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi" in ever URL doesn't add any value to the URL, so it's nice  to
       remove  it.  This  is  easily  done  if you are using the Apache web server with "mod_rewrite" available.
       Adding the following to a ".htaccess" file would allow you to simply use:

        /module_name/run_mode

       If you have problems with mod_rewrite, turn on debugging to see exactly what's happening:

        RewriteLog /home/project/logs/alpha-rewrite.log
        RewriteLogLevel 9

   <b>mod_rewrite</b> <b>related</b> <b>code</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispatch</b> <b>script.</b>
       This seemed necessary to put in the dispatch script to make mod_rewrite happy.  Perhaps it's specific  to
       using "RewriteBase".

         # mod_rewrite alters the PATH_INFO by turning it into a file system path,
         # so we repair it.
         $ENV{PATH_INFO} =~ s/^$ENV{DOCUMENT_ROOT}// if defined $ENV{PATH_INFO};

   <b>Simple</b> <b>Apache</b> <b>Example</b>
         RewriteEngine On

         # You may want to change the base if you are using the dispatcher within a
         # specific directory.
         RewriteBase /

         # If an actual file or directory is requested, serve directly
         RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
         RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

         # Otherwise, pass everything through to the dispatcher
         RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/$1 [L,QSA]

   <b>More</b> <b>complex</b> <b>rewrite:</b> <b>dispatching</b> <b>"/"</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>developers</b>
       Here  is a more complex example that dispatches "/", which would otherwise be treated as a directory, and
       also supports multiple developer directories, so "/~mark" has its own separate dispatching system beneath
       it.

       Note that order matters here! The Location block for "/" needs to come before the user blocks.

         &lt;Location /&gt;
           RewriteEngine On
           RewriteBase /

           # Run "/" through the dispatcher
           RewriteRule ^home/project/www/$ /cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi [L,QSA]

           # Don't apply this rule to the users sub directories.
           RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/~.*$
           # If an actual file or directory is requested, serve directly
           RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
           RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
           # Otherwise, pass everything through to the dispatcher
           RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/$1 [L,QSA]
         &lt;/Location&gt;

         &lt;Location /~mark&gt;
           RewriteEngine On
           RewriteBase /~mark

</pre><h4><b>SUBCLASSING</b></h4><pre>
       While Dispatch tries to be flexible, it won't be able to do everything that people want. Hopefully  we've
       made it flexible enough so that if it doesn't do <u>The</u> <u>Right</u> <u>Thing</u> you can easily subclass it.

</pre><h4><b>SOURCE</b> <b>CODE</b> <b>REPOSITORY</b></h4><pre>
       A public source code repository for this project is hosted here:

       https://github.com/markstos/CGI--Application--Dispatch

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       Since C::A::Dispatch::PSGI will dynamically choose which modules to use as the content generators, it may
       give  someone  the  ability to execute random modules on your system if those modules can be found in you
       path. Of course those modules would have to behave like CGI::Application based modules,  but  that  still
       opens  up the door more than most want. This should only be a problem if you don't use a prefix. By using
       this option you are only allowing Dispatch to pick from a namespace of modules to run.

</pre><h4><b>Backwards</b> <b>Compatibility</b></h4><pre>
       Versions 0.2 and earlier of this module injected the "as_psgi"  method  into  CGI::Application::Dispatch,
       creating a syntax like this:

          ### in your dispatch.psgi:
          use Your::Application::Dispatch;
          use CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI;
          Your::Application::Dispatch-&gt;as_psgi;

          ### In Your::Application::Dispatch;
          use base 'CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI';

       In the current design, the "as_pgsi" method is directly in this module, so a couple of lines of code need
       to be changed:

          ### in your dispatch.psgi:
          use Your::Application::Dispatch;
          Your::Application::Dispatch-&gt;as_psgi;

          ### In Your::Application::Dispatch;
          use base 'CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI';

</pre><h4><b>Differences</b> <b>with</b> <b>CGI::Application::Dispatch</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dispatch()</b>
           Use "as_psgi()" instead.

           Note that the "error_document" key is not supported here. Use the Plack::Middleware::ErrorDocument or
           another PSGI solution instead.

       <b>dispatch_path()</b>
           The  <b>dispatch_path()</b>  method  is  not  supported. The alternative is to reference "$env-&gt;{PATH_INFO}"
           which is available per the PSGI spec.

       <b>handler()</b>
           This provided an Apache-specific handler. Other PSGI components like Plack::Handler::Apache2  provide
           Apache handlers now instead.

       <b>_http_method()</b>
           This method has been eliminated. Check "$env-&gt;{REQUEST_METHOD}" directly instead.

       <b>_parse_path()</b>
           The private <b>_parse_path()</b> method now accepts an additional argument, the PSGI $env hash.

       <b>_run_app()</b>
           The private <b>_run_app()</b> method now accepts an additional argument, the PSGI $env hash.

       <b>_r()</b>
           This method has been eliminated. It does not apply in PSGI.
