</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       UR::Object::Tag - Transitory attribute tags for a UR::Object at a given time.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         if (my @attribs = grep { $_-&gt;type eq 'invalid' } $obj-&gt;attribs()) {
             print $obj-&gt;display_name . " has invalid attributes.  They are:\n";
             for my $atrib (@attribs) {
                 print join(",",$attrib-&gt;properties) . ":" . $attrib-&gt;desc . "\n";
             }
         }

         Project H_NHF00 has invalid attributes, they are:
         project_subdirectory : Directory does not exist.
         target, status : Target cannot be null for projects with an active status.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Objects of this class are created by <b>create_attribs()</b> on classes derived from UR::Object.  They are
       retrieved by UR::Object-&gt;<b>attribs()</b>.

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
       This class inherits from UR::ModuleBase.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       type
           A  single-word  description of the attribute which categorizes the attribute.  Common attribute types
           are:

           invalid
                 Set when the object has invalid properties and cannot be saved.

           changed
                 Set when the object is different than its "saved" version.

           hidden
                 Set when the object has properties which should not be shown.

           editable
                 Set when some part of the object is editable in the current context.

           warning
                 Set when a warning about the state of the object is in effect.

           match Set when a search which is in effect matches this object's property(s).

           comment
                 Set when this attribute is just an informational message.

       properties
           A list of properties to which the attribute applies.  This is null when the attribute applies to  the
           whole  object,  but  typically  returns  one  property  name.  Occasionally, it returns more than one
           property.  Very rarely (currently never), the property may be in the form  of  an  arrayref  like:  [
           class_name,  id,  property_name ], in which case the property may actually be that of another related
           object.

       desc
           A string of text giving detail to the attribute.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       create
           Makes a new UR::Object::Tag.

       delete
           Throws one away.

       filter
           Sets/gets a filter to be applied to all attribute lists returned in the application.  This gives  the
           application  developer  final  veto  power  over  expressed  attributes  in  the app.  In most cases,
           developers will write view components which use attributes, and will ignore them rather than  plug-in
           at this low level to augment/mangle/suppress.

           The  filter  will  be  given  an object reference and a reference to an array of attributes which are
           tentatively to be delivered for the object.
