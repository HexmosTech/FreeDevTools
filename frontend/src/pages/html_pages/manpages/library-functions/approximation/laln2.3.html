       <b>DLALN2</b> solves a 1-by-1 or 2-by-2 linear system of equations of the specified form.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DLALN2 solves a system of the form  (ca A - w D ) X = s B
            or (ca A**T - w D) X = s B   with possible scaling ('s') and
            perturbation of A.  (A**T means A-transpose.)

            A is an NA x NA real matrix, ca is a real scalar, D is an NA x NA
            real diagonal matrix, w is a real or complex value, and X and B are
            NA x 1 matrices -- real if w is real, complex if w is complex.  NA
            may be 1 or 2.

            If w is complex, X and B are represented as NA x 2 matrices,
            the first column of each being the real part and the second
            being the imaginary part.

            's' is a scaling factor (&lt;= 1), computed by DLALN2, which is
            so chosen that X can be computed without overflow.  X is further
            scaled if necessary to assure that norm(ca A - w D)*norm(X) is less
            than overflow.

            If both singular values of (ca A - w D) are less than SMIN,
            SMIN*identity will be used instead of (ca A - w D).  If only one
            singular value is less than SMIN, one element of (ca A - w D) will be
            perturbed enough to make the smallest singular value roughly SMIN.
            If both singular values are at least SMIN, (ca A - w D) will not be
            perturbed.  In any case, the perturbation will be at most some small
            multiple of max( SMIN, ulp*norm(ca A - w D) ).  The singular values
            are computed by infinity-norm approximations, and thus will only be
            correct to a factor of 2 or so.

            Note: all input quantities are assumed to be smaller than overflow
            by a reasonable factor.  (See BIGNUM.)

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>LTRANS</u>

                     LTRANS is LOGICAL

           <u>NA</u>

                     NA is INTEGER
                     The size of the matrix A.  It may (only) be 1 or 2.

           <u>NW</u>

                     NW is INTEGER
                     1 if 'w' is real, 2 if 'w' is complex.  It may only be 1

                     SMIN is DOUBLE PRECISION
                     The desired lower bound on the singular values of A.  This
                     should be a safe distance away from underflow or overflow,
                     say, between (underflow/machine precision) and  (machine
                     precision * overflow ).  (See BIGNUM and ULP.)

                     CA is DOUBLE PRECISION
                     The coefficient c, which A is multiplied by.

           <u>D1</u>

                     D1 is DOUBLE PRECISION
                     The 1,1 element in the diagonal matrix D.

                     D2 is DOUBLE PRECISION

           <u>B</u>

                     B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NW)
                     The NA x NW matrix B (right-hand side).  If NW=2 ('w' is

                     contains the imaginary part.

                     LDB is INTEGER

                     The real part of the scalar 'w'.

           <u>WI</u>

                     WI is DOUBLE PRECISION
                     The imaginary part of the scalar 'w'.  Not used if NW=1.

           <u>X</u>

                     X is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,NW)
                     The NA x NW matrix X (unknowns), as computed by DLALN2.
                     If NW=2 ('w' is complex), on exit, column 1 will contain
                     the real part of X and column 2 will contain the imaginary
                     part.

           <u>LDX</u>

                     LDX is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of X.  It must be at least NA.

                     The scale factor that B must be multiplied by to insure
                     that overflow does not occur when computing X.  Thus,
                     (ca A - w D) X  will be SCALE*B, not B (ignoring
                     perturbations of A.)  It will be at most 1.

           <u>XNORM</u>

                     XNORM is DOUBLE PRECISION
                     The infinity-norm of X, when X is regarded as an NA x NW
                     real matrix.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     An error flag.  It will be set to zero if no error occurs,
                     a negative number if an argument is in error, or a positive
                     number if  ca A - w D  had to be perturbed.
                     The possible values are:
                     = 0: No error occurred, and (ca A - w D) did not have to be
                            perturbed.
                     = 1: (ca A - w D) had to be perturbed to make its smallest
                          (or only) singular value greater than SMIN.
                     NOTE: In the interests of speed, this routine does not
                           check the inputs for errors.

       <b>SLALN2</b> solves a 1-by-1 or 2-by-2 linear system of equations of the specified form.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SLALN2 solves a system of the form  (ca A - w D ) X = s B
            or (ca A**T - w D) X = s B   with possible scaling ('s') and
            perturbation of A.  (A**T means A-transpose.)

            A is an NA x NA real matrix, ca is a real scalar, D is an NA x NA
            real diagonal matrix, w is a real or complex value, and X and B are
            NA x 1 matrices -- real if w is real, complex if w is complex.  NA
            may be 1 or 2.

            If w is complex, X and B are represented as NA x 2 matrices,
            the first column of each being the real part and the second
            being the imaginary part.

            's' is a scaling factor (&lt;= 1), computed by SLALN2, which is
            so chosen that X can be computed without overflow.  X is further
            scaled if necessary to assure that norm(ca A - w D)*norm(X) is less
            than overflow.

            If both singular values of (ca A - w D) are less than SMIN,
            SMIN*identity will be used instead of (ca A - w D).  If only one
            singular value is less than SMIN, one element of (ca A - w D) will be
            perturbed enough to make the smallest singular value roughly SMIN.
            If both singular values are at least SMIN, (ca A - w D) will not be
            perturbed.  In any case, the perturbation will be at most some small
            multiple of max( SMIN, ulp*norm(ca A - w D) ).  The singular values
            are computed by infinity-norm approximations, and thus will only be
            correct to a factor of 2 or so.

            Note: all input quantities are assumed to be smaller than overflow
            by a reasonable factor.  (See BIGNUM.)

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     An error flag.  It will be set to zero if no error occurs,
                     a negative number if an argument is in error, or a positive

                     = 0: No error occurred, and (ca A - w D) did not have to be
