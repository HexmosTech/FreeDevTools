</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       • <b>inbuf</b>: Address of input buffer (choice).

       • <b>count</b>: Number of elements in input buffer (integer).

       • <b>datatype</b>: Data type of elements of input buffer (handle).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The    global    reduce   functions   (<u>MPI_Reduce_local</u>,   <u>MPI_Op_create</u>,   <u>MPI_Op_free</u>,   <u>MPI_Allreduce</u>,
       MPI_Reduce_local_scatter, MPI_Scan) perform a global reduce operation (such as  sum,  max,  logical  AND,
       etc.)  across  all the members of a group. The reduction operation can be either one of a predefined list
       of operations, or a user-defined operation. The global reduction functions come  in  several  flavors:  a
       reduce  that  returns  the result of the reduction at one node, an all-reduce that returns this result at
       all nodes, and a scan (parallel prefix) operation. In addition, a reduce-scatter operation  combines  the
       functionality of a reduce and a scatter operation.

       <u>MPI_Reduce_local</u>  combines  the  elements  provided  in  the  input and input/output buffers of the local
       process, using the operation op, and returns the combined value in the  inout/output  buffer.  The  input
       buffer  is  defined  by  the  arguments  inbuf,  count, and datatype; the output buffer is defined by the
       arguments inoutbuf, count, and datatype; both have the same number of elements, with the same  type.  The
       routine  is  a  local call. The process can provide one element, or a sequence of elements, in which case
       the combine operation is executed element-wise on each  entry  of  the  sequence.  For  example,  if  the
       operation  is MPI_MAX and the input buffer contains two elements that are floating-point numbers (count =
       2 and datatype =  MPI_FLOAT),  then  <a href="../man1/inoutbuf.1.html">inoutbuf</a>(1)  =  global  max  (<a href="../man1/inbuf.1.html">inbuf</a>(1))  and  <a href="../man2/inoutbuf.2.html">inoutbuf</a>(2)  =  global
       max(<a href="../man2/inbuf.2.html">inbuf</a>(2)).

</pre><h4><b>USE</b> <b>OF</b> <b>IN-PLACE</b> <b>OPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The use of MPI_IN_PLACE is disallowed with <u>MPI_Reduce_local</u>.

</pre><h4><b>PREDEFINED</b> <b>REDUCE</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  set  of  predefined  operations provided by MPI is listed below (Predefined Reduce Operations). That
       section also enumerates the datatypes each operation can be applied to. In  addition,  users  may  define
       their  own  operations  that  can be overloaded to operate on several datatypes, either basic or derived.
       This is further explained in the description of the  user-defined  operations  (see  the  man  pages  for
       <u>MPI_Op_create</u> and MPI_Op_free).

       The  operation  op  is always assumed to be associative. All predefined operations are also assumed to be
       commutative. Users may define operations that are assumed to be associative,  but  not  commutative.  The
       ``canonical’’  evaluation  order of a reduction is determined by the ranks of the processes in the group.
       However, the implementation can take advantage of associativity, or associativity and  commutativity,  in
       order  to change the order of evaluation. This may change the result of the reduction for operations that
       are not strictly associative and commutative, such as floating point addition.

       Predefined operators work only with the MPI types listed below (Predefined  Reduce  Operations,  and  the
       section  MINLOC  and MAXLOC, below). User-defined operators may operate on general, derived datatypes. In
       this case, each argument that the reduce operation is applied to is  one  element  described  by  such  a
       datatype,  which  may contain several basic values. This is further explained in Section 4.9.4 of the MPI
       Standard, “User-Defined Operations.”

       The  following  predefined  operations  are  supplied  for   <u>MPI_Reduce_local</u>   and   related   functions
       <u>MPI_Allreduce</u>,  <u>MPI_Reduce_scatter</u>,  and <u>MPI_Scan</u>.  These operations are invoked by placing the following
       in op:

          Name                Meaning
          ---------           --------------------
          MPI_MAX             maximum
          MPI_MIN             minimum
          MPI_SUM             sum
          MPI_PROD            product
          MPI_LAND            logical and
          MPI_BAND            bit-wise and
          MPI_LOR             logical or
          MPI_BOR             bit-wise or
          MPI_LXOR            logical xor
          MPI_BXOR            bit-wise xor
          MPI_MAXLOC          max value and location
          MPI_MINLOC          min value and location

       The two operations MPI_MINLOC and MPI_MAXLOC are discussed separately below (MINLOC and MAXLOC). For  the
       other  predefined  operations,  we enumerate below the allowed combinations of op and datatype arguments.
       First, define groups of MPI basic datatypes in the following way:

          C integer:            MPI_INT, MPI_LONG, MPI_SHORT,
                                MPI_UNSIGNED_SHORT, MPI_UNSIGNED,
                                MPI_UNSIGNED_LONG
          Fortran integer:      MPI_INTEGER
          Floating-point:       MPI_FLOAT, MPI_DOUBLE, MPI_REAL,
                                MPI_DOUBLE_PRECISION, MPI_LONG_DOUBLE
          Logical:              MPI_LOGICAL
          Complex:              MPI_COMPLEX
          Byte:                 MPI_BYTE

       Now, the valid datatypes for each option is specified below.

          Op                              Allowed Types
          ----------------         ---------------------------
          MPI_MAX, MPI_MIN                C integer, Fortran integer,
                                                  floating-point

          MPI_SUM, MPI_PROD               C integer, Fortran integer,
                                                  floating-point, complex

          MPI_LAND, MPI_LOR,              C integer, logical
          MPI_LXOR

          MPI_BAND, MPI_BOR,              C integer, Fortran integer, byte
          MPI_BXOR

</pre><h4><b>MINLOC</b> <b>AND</b> <b>MAXLOC</b></h4><pre>
       The operator MPI_MINLOC is used to compute a global minimum and also an index  attached  to  the  minimum
       value. MPI_MAXLOC similarly computes a global maximum and index. One application of these is to compute a
       global minimum (maximum) and the rank of the process containing this value.

       The operation that defines MPI_MAXLOC is

                   ( u )    (  v )      ( w )
                   (   )  o (    )   =  (   )
                   ( i )    (  j )      ( k )

          where

              w = max(u, v)

          and

                   ( i            if u &gt; v
                   (
             k   = ( min(i, j)    if u = v
                   (
                   (  j           if u &lt; v)

       MPI_MINLOC is defined similarly:

                   ( u )    (  v )      ( w )
                   (   )  o (    )   =  (   )
                   ( i )    (  j )      ( k )

          where

              w = min(u, v)

          and

                   ( i            if u &lt; v
                   (
             k   = ( min(i, j)    if u = v
                   (
                   (  j           if u &gt; v)

       Both  operations are associative and commutative. Note that if MPI_MAXLOC is applied to reduce a sequence
       of pairs (<a href="../man0/u.0.html">u</a>(0), 0), (<a href="../man1/u.1.html">u</a>(1), 1), …, (u(n-1), n-1), then the value returned is (u , r), where u= max(i) u(i)
       and r is the index of the first global maximum in the sequence. Thus, if each process  supplies  a  value
       and its rank within the group, then a reduce operation with op = MPI_MAXLOC will return the maximum value
       and  the rank of the first process with that value. Similarly, MPI_MINLOC can be used to return a minimum
       and its index. More generally, MPI_MINLOC computes a lexicographic minimum, where  elements  are  ordered
       according to the first component of each pair, and ties are resolved according to the second component.

       The reduce operation is defined to operate on arguments that consist of a pair: value and index. For both
       Fortran  and  C,  types  are  provided  to  describe  the pair. The potentially mixed-type nature of such
       arguments is a problem in Fortran. The problem is circumvented, for Fortran, by having  the  MPI-provided
       type  consist  of  a  pair of the same type as value, and coercing the index to this type also. In C, the
       MPI-provided pair type has distinct types and the index is an int.

       In order to use MPI_MINLOC and MPI_MAXLOC in a reduce operation, one must  provide  a  datatype  argument
       that  represents  a  pair  (value and index). MPI provides nine such predefined datatypes. The operations
       MPI_MAXLOC and MPI_MINLOC can be used with each of the following datatypes:

          Fortran:
          Name                     Description
          MPI_2REAL                pair of REALs
          MPI_2DOUBLE_PRECISION    pair of DOUBLE-PRECISION variables
          MPI_2INTEGER             pair of INTEGERs

          C:
          Name                     Description
          MPI_FLOAT_INT            float and int
          MPI_DOUBLE_INT           double and int
          MPI_LONG_INT             long and int
          MPI_2INT                 pair of ints
          MPI_SHORT_INT            short and int
          MPI_LONG_DOUBLE_INT      long double and int

       The data type <b>MPI_2REAL</b> is equivalent to:

          call MPI_TYPE_CONTIGUOUS(2, MPI_REAL, MPI_2REAL)

       Similar statements apply for MPI_2INTEGER, MPI_2DOUBLE_PRECISION, and MPI_2INT.

       The datatype MPI_FLOAT_INT is as if defined by the following sequence of instructions.

       ::.. code-block:: c
          type[0] = MPI_FLOAT type[1] = MPI_INT disp[0] = 0 disp[1] = sizeof(float) block[0] = 1  block[1]  =  1
          MPI_TYPE_STRUCT(2, block, disp, type, MPI_FLOAT_INT)

       Similar statements apply for MPI_LONG_INT and MPI_DOUBLE_INT.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in Fortran.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>COLLECTIVE</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  reduction operators ( MPI_Op ) do not return an error value. As a result, if the functions detect an
       error, all they can do is either call <u>MPI_Abort</u> or silently skip the problem. Thus,  if  you  change  the
       error handler from MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL to something else, for example, MPI_ERRORS_RETURN , then no error
       may be indicated.

       The  reason for this is the performance problems in ensuring that all collective routines return the same
       error value.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as  the  return  result  of  the  function  and
       Fortran routines in the last argument.

       Before  the  error  value  is  returned,  the current MPI error handler associated with the communication
       object (e.g., communicator, window, file) is called.  If no communication object is associated  with  the
       MPI  call,  then  the call is considered attached to MPI_COMM_SELF and will call the associated MPI error
       handler.  When  MPI_COMM_SELF  is  not  initialized   (i.e.,   before   <u>MPI_Init</u>/<u>MPI_Init_thread</u>,   after
       <u>MPI_Finalize</u>,  or  when using the Sessions Model exclusively) the error raises the initial error handler.
       The initial error handler can be changed by calling <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u> on MPI_COMM_SELF  when  using
       the  World  model,  or the mpi_initial_errhandler CLI argument to mpiexec or info key to <u>MPI_Comm_spawn</u>/‐
       <u>MPI_Comm_spawn_multiple</u>.  If no other appropriate error handler has been set, then the  MPI_ERRORS_RETURN
       error  handler  is  called for MPI I/O functions and the MPI_ERRORS_ABORT error handler is called for all
       other MPI functions.

       Open MPI includes three predefined error handlers that can be used:

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL</b> Causes the program to abort all connected MPI processes.

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_ABORT</b> An error handler that can be invoked on a communicator, window, file, or session. When
         called on a communicator, it acts as if <u>MPI_Abort</u> was called on  that  communicator.  If  called  on  a
         window  or file, acts as if <u>MPI_Abort</u> was called on a communicator containing the group of processes in
         the corresponding window or file. If called on a session, aborts only the local process.

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</b> Returns an error code to the application.

       MPI applications can also implement their own error handlers by calling:

       • <u>MPI_Comm_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u>

       • <u>MPI_File_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_File_set_errhandler</u>

       • <u>MPI_Session_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Session_set_errhandler</u> or at <u>MPI_Session_init</u>

       • <u>MPI_Win_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Win_set_errhandler</u>

       Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.

       See the <u>MPI</u> <u>man</u> <u>page</u> for a full list of <u>MPI</u> <u>error</u> <u>codes</u>.

       See the Error Handling section of the MPI-3.1 standard for more information.
