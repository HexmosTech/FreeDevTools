               TYPE(MPI_Comm), INTENT(IN) :: comm
               INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: num_to_ack
               INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: num_acked
               INTEGER, OPTIONAL, INTENT(OUT) :: ierror

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       • <b>comm</b>: Communicator (handle).

       • <b>num_to_ack</b>: maximum number of process failures to acknowledge in <u>comm</u> (integer)

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       • <b>num_acked</b>: number of acknowledged failures in <u>comm</u> (integer).

       • <b>ierror</b>: Fortran only: Error status (integer).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       his local operation gives the users a way to <b>acknowledge</b> locally notified failures on <u>comm</u>. The operation
       acknowledges  the  first  <u>num_to_ack</u>  process  failures  on <u>comm</u>, that is, it acknowledges the failure of
       members with a rank lower than <u>num_to_ack</u> in the group that would be produced by  a  concurrent  call  to
       <u>MPIX_Comm_get_failed</u> on the same <u>comm</u>.

       The  operation also sets the value of <u>num_acked</u> to the current number of acknowledged process failures in
       <u>comm</u>, that is, a process failure has been acknowledged on <u>comm</u> if and only if the rank of the process  is
       lower  than <u>num_acked</u> in the group that would be produced by a subsequent call to <u>MPIX_Comm_get_failed</u> on
       the same <u>comm</u>.

       <u>num_acked</u> can be larger than <u>num_to_ack</u> when process failures have been acknowledged in a prior  call  to
       <u>MPIX_Comm_ack_failed</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EFFECT</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ACKNOWLEDGING</b> <b>FAILURES</b></h4><pre>
       After  an MPI process failure is acknowledged on <u>comm</u>, unmatched MPI_ANY_SOURCE receive operations on the
       same <u>comm</u> that would have raised an error of class MPIX_ERR_PROC_FAILED_PENDING proceed  without  further
       raising errors due to this acknowledged failure.

       Also,  <u>MPIX_Comm_agree</u>  on the same <u>comm</u> will not raise an error of class MPI_ERR_PROC_FAILED due to this
       acknowledged failure.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b> <b>PATTERNS</b></h4><pre>
       One may query, without side effect, for the number of currently  aknowledged  process  failures  <u>comm</u>  by
       supplying 0 in <u>num_to_ack</u>.

       Conversely, one may unconditionally acknowledge all currently known process failures in <u>comm</u> by supplying
       the size of the group of <u>comm</u> in <u>num_to_ack</u>.

       Note  that  the number of acknowledged processes, as returned in <u>num_acked</u>, can be smaller or larger than
       the value supplied in <u>num_to_ack</u>; It is however never larger than the size of the  group  returned  by  a
       subsequent call to <u>MPIX_Comm_get_failed</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EFFECT</b> <b>ON</b> <b>COLLECTIVE</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Calling  <u>MPIX_Comm_ack_failed</u>  on  a  communicator  with failed MPI processes has no effect on collective
       operations (except for <u>MPIX_Comm_agree</u>).  If a collective operation would  raise  an  error  due  to  the
       communicator  containing  a  failed process it will continue to raise an error even after the failure has
       been acknowledged. In order to use collective operations between MPI processes  of  a  communicator  that
       contains   failed   MPI   processes,   users   should   create  a  new  communicator  (e.g.,  by  calling
       <u>MPIX_Comm_shrink</u>).

</pre><h4><b>WHEN</b> <b>COMMUNICATOR</b> <b>IS</b> <b>AN</b> <b>INTER-COMMUNICATOR</b></h4><pre>
       When the communicator is an inter-communicator, the failures of members in both the local and the  remote
       groups of <u>comm</u> are acknowledged.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Almost  all  MPI  routines  return  an  error  value; C routines as the return result of the function and
       Fortran routines in the last argument.

       Before the error value is returned, the current MPI  error  handler  associated  with  the  communication
       object  (e.g.,  communicator, window, file) is called.  If no communication object is associated with the
       MPI call, then the call is considered attached to MPI_COMM_SELF and will call the  associated  MPI  error
       handler.   When   MPI_COMM_SELF   is   not  initialized  (i.e.,  before  <u>MPI_Init</u>/<u>MPI_Init_thread</u>,  after
       <u>MPI_Finalize</u>, or when using the Sessions Model exclusively) the error raises the initial  error  handler.
       The  initial  error handler can be changed by calling <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u> on MPI_COMM_SELF when using
       the World model, or the mpi_initial_errhandler CLI argument to mpiexec or info  key  to  <u>MPI_Comm_spawn</u>/‐
       <u>MPI_Comm_spawn_multiple</u>.   If no other appropriate error handler has been set, then the MPI_ERRORS_RETURN
       error handler is called for MPI I/O functions and the MPI_ERRORS_ABORT error handler is  called  for  all
       other MPI functions.

       Open MPI includes three predefined error handlers that can be used:

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL</b> Causes the program to abort all connected MPI processes.

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_ABORT</b> An error handler that can be invoked on a communicator, window, file, or session. When
         called  on  a  communicator,  it  acts  as if <u>MPI_Abort</u> was called on that communicator. If called on a
         window or file, acts as if <u>MPI_Abort</u> was called on a communicator containing the group of processes  in
         the corresponding window or file. If called on a session, aborts only the local process.

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</b> Returns an error code to the application.

       MPI applications can also implement their own error handlers by calling:

       • <u>MPI_Comm_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u>

       • <u>MPI_File_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_File_set_errhandler</u>

       • <u>MPI_Session_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Session_set_errhandler</u> or at <u>MPI_Session_init</u>

       • <u>MPI_Win_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Win_set_errhandler</u>

       Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.

       See the <u>MPI</u> <u>man</u> <u>page</u> for a full list of <u>MPI</u> <u>error</u> <u>codes</u>.

       See the Error Handling section of the MPI-3.1 standard for more information.
