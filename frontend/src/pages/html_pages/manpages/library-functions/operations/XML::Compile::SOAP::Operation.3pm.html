</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XML::Compile::SOAP::Operation - base-class for possible interactions

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
        XML::Compile::SOAP::Operation is extended by
          XML::Compile::SOAP11::Operation
          XML::Compile::SOAP12::Operation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        # created by XML::Compile::WSDL11
        my $op = $wsdl-&gt;operation('GetStockPrices');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These objects are created by XML::Compile::WSDL11, grouping information about a certain specific message
       interchange between a client and a server.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructors</b>
       XML::Compile::SOAP::Operation-&gt;<b>new</b>(%options)
            -Option     --Default
             action       undef
             endpoints    []
             kind         &lt;required&gt;
             name         &lt;required&gt;
             schemas      &lt;required&gt;
             server_type  undef
             transport    'HTTP'

           action =&gt; STRING
             Some  string which is referring to the action which is taken.  For SOAP protocols, this defines the
             soapAction header.

           endpoints =&gt; ADDRESS|ARRAY
             Where to contact the server.

           kind =&gt; 'one-way'|...
             This returns the type of operation this is.  There are four kinds, which are  returned  as  strings
             "one-way",  "request-response",  "sollicit-response",  and  "notification".   The  latter  two  are
             initiated by a server, the former two by a client.

           name =&gt; STRING
           schemas =&gt; XML::Compile::Cache
           server_type =&gt; NAME
             Most server implementations show some problems.  Also, servers may produce  responses  using  their
             own  namespaces  (like for error codes).  When you know which server you are talking to, the quirks
             of  the  specific  server  type  can  be  loaded.   Read  more  in  the  "Supported   servers"   in
             XML::Compile::SOAP.

           transport =&gt; URI|'HTTP'
             "HTTP"  is  short for "<a href="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http/">http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http/</a>", which is a constant to indicate that
             transport should use the HyperText Transfer Protocol.

   <b>Accessors</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>bindingName</b>()
       $obj-&gt;<b>clientClass</b>()
           Returns the class name which implements the Client side for this protocol.

       $obj-&gt;<b>endPoints</b>()
           Returns the list of alternative URLs for the end-point, which should be defined within the  service's
           port declaration.

       $obj-&gt;<b>kind</b>()
       $obj-&gt;<b>longName</b>()
           [3.06] prefix the service name before the operation name, to make it really unique.  A "#" is used as
           separator.

       $obj-&gt;<b>name</b>()
       $obj-&gt;<b>portName</b>()
       $obj-&gt;<b>schemas</b>()
       $obj-&gt;<b>serverClass</b>()
           Returns the class name which implements the Server side for this protocol.

       $obj-&gt;<b>serviceName</b>()
       $obj-&gt;<b>soapAction</b>()
           Used for the "soapAction" header in HTTP transport, for routing messages through firewalls.

       $obj-&gt;<b>version</b>()
       $obj-&gt;<b>wsaAction</b>('INPUT'|'OUTPUT')
           Only  available  when  "XML::Compile::SOAP::WSA" is loaded. It specifies the name of the operation in
           the WSA header.  With "INPUT", it is the Action to be used with a message sent to the  server  (input
           to the server). The "OUTPUT" is used by the server in its message back.

   <b>Handlers</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>compileClient</b>(%options)
           Returns  one  CODE  reference  which handles the conversion from a perl data-structure into a request
           message, the transmission of the request, the receipt of the answer, and the decoding of that  answer
           into a Perl data-structure.

       $obj-&gt;<b>compileHandler</b>(%options)
           Returns  a  code  reference which translates in incoming XML message into Perl a data-structure, then
           calls the callback.  The result of the callback is encoded from Perl into XML and returned.

            -Option  --Default
             callback  &lt;required&gt;

           callback =&gt; CODE
       $obj-&gt;<b>compileTransporter</b>(%options)
           Create the transporter code for a certain specific target.

            -Option        --Default
             endpoint        &lt;from WSDL&gt;
             server          undef
             transport_hook  undef
             transporter     &lt;created&gt;

           endpoint =&gt; URI|ARRAY-of-URI
             Overrule the destination address(es).

           server =&gt; URI-HOST
             Overrule only the server part in the endpoint, not the whole endpoint.  This could be a string like
             "username:password@myhost:4711".  Only used when no explicit "endpoint" is provided.

           transport_hook =&gt; CODE
             Passed to XML::Compile::Transport::compileClient(hook).  Can be used to create off-line  tests  and
             last resort work-arounds.  See the DETAILs chapter in the XML::Compile::Transport manual page.

           transporter =&gt; CODE|XML::Compile::Transport-object
             The  routine  which  will be used to exchange the data with the server.  This code is created by an
             <b>XML::Compile::Transport::compileClient()</b> extension.

             By default, a transporter compatible to the protocol is created.  However, in most cases  you  want
             to reuse one (HTTP1.1) connection to a server.

             [3.14]  You  may  provide  a  XML::Compile::Transport  object as well.  Its <b>compileClient()</b> will be
             called for you.

   <b>Helpers</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>explain</b>($wsdl, $format, $direction, %options)
           Dump an annotated structure showing how the operation works, helping  developers  to  understand  the
           schema. $format is "PERL" or "XML".

           The $direction is "INPUT", it will return the message which the client sends to the server (input for
           the server). The "OUTPUT" message is sent as response by the server.

       $obj-&gt;<b>parsedWSDL</b>(%options)
           [2.29] For some purposes, it is useful to get access to the parsed WSDL structure.

           <b>Be</b>  <b>aware</b>  that  the structure returned is consided "internal" and strongly influenced by behavior of
           XML::Compile; backwards compatibility will not be maintained at all cost.

           You can use <b>XML::Compile::Schema::template()</b> format "TREE" to get  more  details  about  the  element
           types mentioned in this structure.

           example:

             use Data::Dumper;
             $Data::Dumper::Indent    = 1;
             $Data::Dumper::Quotekeys = 0;

             print Dumper $op-&gt;parsedWSDL;
