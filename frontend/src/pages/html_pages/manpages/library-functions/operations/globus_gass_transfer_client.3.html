       GASS Transfer Client Operations.

       Client-Initiated Operations

       One mode of using the GASS Transfer API is to initiate file transfers. The operations supported by the
       GASS Transfer API are file get, put, and append. These operations are provided for HTTP, and HTTPS file
       servers. The <b>protocol</b> <b>module</b> <b>interface</b> allows support for additional protocols to be added easily.

       The GASS transfer library provides both blocking and non-blocking versions of all its client functions.
       When a blocking function completes, or the non-blocking function's callback is called, the user should
       check the request's status to discover whether the transfer was completed successfully, denied, or
       referred.

</pre><h4><b>Function</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>int</b> <b>globus_gass_transfer_append</b> <b>(globus_gass_transfer_request_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>request,</b> <b>globus_gass_transfer_requestattr_t</b>
       <b>*</b> <b>attr,</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b> <b>url,</b> <b>globus_size_t</b> <b>length)</b>
       Blocking file append.

       This function initiates a new 'append' request of the file named by <u>url</u>. The entire file will be
       transferred to the server if the user is authorized to do so. This function blocks until the GASS library
       has determined whether the file may be retrieved by the caller, may not because it is a referral to
       another URL or URLs, or the server has denied the request.

       Upon returning from this function, the request handle is initialized to refer to the <u>append</u> request's
       state.

       If the server can't store the file at <u>url</u>, but has an alternative location for the user to store to, then
       this function return with request's status set to <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_REQUEST_REFERRED</u>.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>request</u> A pointer to an uninitialized request handle.
           <u>attr</u> Request attributes.
           <u>url</u> URL to append to.
           <u>length</u> The length of the data to append to the url, if known. If this parameter is set to
           <u>GLOBUS_GASS_LENGTH_UNKNOWN</u>, then the append may fail if the protocol does not support arbitrarily-
           length files.

       <b>Return</b> <b>values</b>
           <u>GLOBUS_SUCCESS</u> The put was successfully initiated.
           <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_ERROR_NULL_POINTER</u> One of request, attr, or callback was GLOBUS_NULL. The put
           could not be processed.
           <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_ERROR_INTERNAL_ERROR</u> An internal resource was not available to process the put.
           <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED</u> No protocol handler for doing a append on this URL type is
           implemented.
           <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_ERROR_BAD_URL</u> The URL could not be parsed.

   <b>int</b> <b>globus_gass_transfer_get</b> <b>(globus_gass_transfer_request_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>request,</b> <b>globus_gass_transfer_requestattr_t</b> <b>*</b>
       <b>attr,</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b> <b>url)</b>
       Blocking file get.

       This function initiates a new 'get' request of the file named by <u>url</u>. The entire file will be transferred
       from the server if the file exists and user is authorized to do so. This function blocks until the GASS
       library has determined whether the file may be retrievied by the caller, may not because it is a referral
       to another URL or URLs, or the server has denied the request.

       Upon returning from this function, the request handle is initialized to refer to the <u>get</u> request's state.
       This request handle must be destroyed after the user has finished processing the data associated with the
       callback.

       If the file doesn't exist at <u>url</u>, but a referral does, then this function will return with the request's
       status set to <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_REQUEST_REFERRED</u>.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>request</u> A pointer to an uninitialized request handle.
           <u>attr</u> Request attributes.
           <u>url</u> URL to get

       <b>Return</b> <b>values</b>
           <u>GLOBUS_SUCCESS</u> The get was successfully initiated.
           <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_ERROR_NULL_POINTER</u> One of request or attr was GLOBUS_NULL. The get could not be
           processed.
           <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_ERROR_INTERNAL_ERROR</u> An internal resource was not available to process the get.
           <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED</u> No protocol handler for doing a get on this URL type is
           implemented.
           <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_ERROR_BAD_URL</u> The URL could not be parsed.

       Nonblocking file append.

       This function initiates a new 'append' request of the file named by <u>url</u>. The entire file will be

       stored or not.

       Upon returning from this function, the request handle is initialized to refer to the <u>append</u> request's
       state.

       If the server can't store the file at <u>url</u>, but has an alternative location for the user to store to, then
       the callback function will be called with the request's status set to
