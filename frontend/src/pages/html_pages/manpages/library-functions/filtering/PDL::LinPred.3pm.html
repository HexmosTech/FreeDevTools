       PDL::Filter::LinPred - Linear predictive filtering

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               $x = PDL::Filter::LinPred-&gt;new(
                       {NLags =&gt; 10,
                        LagInterval =&gt; 2,
                        LagsBehind =&gt; 2,
                        Data =&gt; $dat});

               ($pd,$corrslic) = $x-&gt;predict($dat);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A filter by doing linear prediction: tries to predict the next value in a data stream as accurately as
       possible. The filtered data is the predicted value. The parameters are

       NLags   Number of time lags used for prediction

       LagInterval
               How many points each lag should be

       LagsBehind
               If,  for  some  strange  reason,  you  wish  to predict not the next but the one after that (i.e.
               usually f(t) is predicted from f(t-1) and  f(t-2)  etc.,  but  with  LagsBehind  =&gt;  2,  f(t)  is
               predicted from f(t-2) and f(t-3)).

       Data    The  input  data,  which  may  contain  other  dimensions  past the first (time).  The extraneous
               dimensions are assumed to represent epochs so the data is just concatenated.

       AutoCovar
               As an alternative to <b>Data</b>, you can just give the temporal autocorrelation function.

       Smooth  Don't do prediction or filtering but smoothing.

       The method <b>predict</b> gives a prediction for some data plus a corresponding slice of the data, if  evaluated
       in list context. This slice is given so that you may, if you wish, easily plot them atop each other.

       The rest of the documentation is under lazy evaluation.
