</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dnsjit.filter.timing - Filter to pass objects to the next receiver based on timing between packets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         local filter = require("dnsjit.filter.timing").new()
         ...
         filter:receiver(...)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Filter  to  manipulate  processing  so  it  simulates  the actual timing when packets arrived or to delay
       processing.

   <b>Functions</b>
       <b>Timing.new</b>()
              Create a new Timing filter.

       <b>Timing:log</b>()
              Return the Log object to control logging of this instance or module.

       <b>Timing:keep</b>()
              Set the timing mode to keep the timing between packets.

       <b>Timing:increase</b>(ns)
              Set the timing mode to increase the timing between packets by the given number of nanoseconds.

       <b>Timing:reduce</b>(ns)
              Set the timing mode to reduce the timing between packets by the given number of nanoseconds.

       <b>Timing:multiply</b>(factor)
              Set the timing mode to multiply the timing between packets by the given factor (float/double).

       <b>Timing:fixed</b>(ns)
              Set the timing mode to a fixed number of nanoseconds between packets.

       <b>Timing:realtime</b>(drift, batch_size)
              Set the timing mode to simulate the timing of packets  in  realtime.   Packets  are  processed  in
              batches  of  given size (default 128) before adjusting time. Aborts if real time drifts ahead more
              than given number of seconds (default 1.0s).

       <b>Timing:receive</b>()
              Return the C functions and context for receiving objects.

       <b>Timing:receiver</b>(o)
              Set the receiver to pass objects to.

       <b>Timing:produce</b>()
              Return the C functions and context for producing objects.

       <b>Timing:producer</b>(o)
              Set the producer to get objects from.
