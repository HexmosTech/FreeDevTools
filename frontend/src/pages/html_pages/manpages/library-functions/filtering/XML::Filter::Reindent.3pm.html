</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XML::Filter::Reindent - Reformats whitespace for pretty printing XML

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use XML::Handler::Composer;
        use XML::Filter::Reindent;

        my $composer = new XML::Handler::Composer (%OPTIONS);
        my $indent = new XML::Filter::Reindent (Handler =&gt; $composer, %OPTIONS);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       XML::Filter::Reindent is a sub class of XML::Filter::DetectWS.

       XML::Filter::Reindent can be used as a PerlSAX filter to reformat an XML document before sending it to a
       PerlSAX handler that prints it (like XML::Handler::Composer.)

       Like XML::Filter::DetectWS, it detects ignorable whitespace and blocks of whitespace characters in
       certain places. It uses this information and information supplied by the user to determine where
       whitespace may be modified, deleted or inserted.  Based on the indent settings, it then modifies, inserts
       and deletes characters and ignorable_whitespace events accordingly.

       This is just a first stab at the implementation.  It may be buggy and may change completely!

</pre><h4><b>Constructor</b> <b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       •   Handler

           The PerlSAX handler (or filter) that will receive the PerlSAX events from this filter.

       •   Tab (Default: one space)

           The number of spaces per indent level for elements etc. in document content.

       •   Newline (Default: "\x0A")

           The  newline  to  use  when  re-indenting.   The default is the internal newline used by XML::Parser,
           XML::DOM etc., and should be fine when used in combination with XML::Handler::Composer.

</pre><h4><b>$self-&gt;indent_children</b> <b>($start_element_event)</b></h4><pre>
       This method  determines  whether  children  of  a  certain  element  may  be  reformatted.   The  default
       implementation  checks  the PreserveWS parameter of the specified start_element event and returns 0 if it
       is set or MAYBE otherwise.  The value MAYBE (2) indicates that further investigation is needed, e.g.   by
       examining  the element contents. A value of 1 means yes, indent the child nodes, no further investigation
       is needed.

       NOTE: the PreserveWS parameter is set by the parent class, XML::Filter::DetectWS, when the element or one
       of its ancestors has the attribute xml:space="preserve".

       Override this method to tweak the behavior of this class.

</pre><h4><b>$self-&gt;indent_element</b> <b>($start_element_event,</b> <b>$parent_says_indent)</b></h4><pre>
       This method determines whether a certain element may be re-indented.  The default implementation  returns
       the  value  of  the $parent_says_indent parameter, which was set to the value returned by indent_children
       for the parent element. In other words, the element will be re-indented if the parent element allows it.

       Override this method to tweak the behavior of this class.  I'm not sure how useful this hook  is.  Please
       provide feedback!

</pre><h4><b>Current</b> <b>Implementation</b></h4><pre>
       The  current  implementation  puts  all  incoming Perl SAX events in a queue for further processing. When
       determining which nodes should be re-indented, it sometimes needs information from previous events, hence
       the use of the queue.

       The parameter (Compress =&gt; 1) is added to matching start_element and end_element events with no events in
       between This indicates to an XML printer that a compressed notation can be used, e.g &lt;foo/&gt;.

       If  an  element  allows  reformatting  of  its  contents  (xml:space="preserve"  was   not   active   and
       indent_children  returned  MAYBE),  the element contents will be reformatted unless it only has one child
       node and that child is a regular text node (characters event.)  In that case, the element will be printed
       as &lt;foo&gt;text contents&lt;/foo&gt;.

       If you want element  nodes  with  just  one  text  child  to  be  reindented  as  well,  simply  override
       indent_children to return 1 instead of MAYBE (2.)

       This behavior may be changed or extended in the future.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       This code is highly experimental!  It has not been tested well and the API may change.

       The code that detects blocks of whitespace at potential indent positions may need some work.
