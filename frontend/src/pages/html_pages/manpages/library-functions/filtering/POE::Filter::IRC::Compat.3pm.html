</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Filter::IRC::Compat - A filter which converts POE::Filter::IRCD output into POE::Component::IRC
       events

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        my $filter = POE::Filter::IRC::Compat-&gt;new();
        my @events = @{ $filter-&gt;get( [ @lines ] ) };
        my @msgs = @{ $filter-&gt;put( [ @messages ] ) };

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Filter::IRC::Compat is a POE::Filter that converts POE::Filter::IRCD output into the
       POE::Component::IRC compatible event references. Basically a hack, so I could replace POE::Filter::IRC
       with something that was more generic.

       Among other things, it converts normal text into thoroughly CTCP-quoted messages, and transmogrifies
       CTCP-quoted messages into their normal, sane components. Rather what you'd expect a filter to do.

       A note: the CTCP protocol sucks bollocks. If I ever meet the fellow who came up with it, I'll shave their
       head and tattoo obscenities on it.  Just read the "specification" (<u>docs/ctcpspec.html</u> in this
       distribution) and you'll hopefully see what I mean. Quote this, quote that, quote this again, all in
       different and weird ways... and who the hell needs to send mixed CTCP and text messages? WTF? It looks
       like it's practically complexity for complexity's sake -- and don't even get me started on the design of
       the DCC protocol! Anyhow, enough ranting. Onto the rest of the docs...

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"new"</b>
       Returns a POE::Filter::IRC::Compat object. Takes no arguments.

   <b>"clone"</b>
       Makes a copy of the filter, and clears the copy's buffer.

   <b>"get"</b>
       Takes an arrayref of POE::Filter::IRCD hashrefs and produces an arrayref of POE::Component::IRC
       compatible event hashrefs. Yay.

   <b>"get_one_start",</b> <b>"get_one"</b>
       These perform a similar function as "get" but enable the filter to work with POE::Filter::Stackable.

   <b>"put"</b>
       Takes an array reference of CTCP messages to be properly quoted. This doesn't support CTCPs embedded in
       normal messages, which is a brain-dead hack in the protocol, so do it yourself if you really need it.
       Returns an array reference of the quoted lines for sending.

   <b>"debug"</b>
       Takes an optional true/false value which enables/disables debugging accordingly. Returns the debug
       status.

   <b>"chantypes"</b>
       Takes an arrayref of possible channel prefix indicators.

   <b>"identifymsg"</b>
       Takes a boolean to turn on/off the support for CAPAB IDENTIFY-MSG.
