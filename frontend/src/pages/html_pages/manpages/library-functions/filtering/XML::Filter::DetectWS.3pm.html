</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XML::Filter::DetectWS - A PerlSAX filter that detects ignorable whitespace

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use XML::Filter::DetectWS;

        my $detect = new XML::Filter::DetectWS (Handler =&gt; $handler,
                                                SkipIgnorableWS =&gt; 1);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This a PerlSAX filter that detects which character data contains ignorable whitespace and optionally
       filters it.

       Note that this is just a first stab at the implementation and it may change completely in the near
       future. Please provide feedback whether you like it or not, so I know whether I should change it.

       The XML spec defines ignorable whitespace as the character data found in elements that were defined in an
       &lt;!ELEMENT&gt; declaration with a model of 'EMPTY' or 'Children' (Children is the rule that does not contain
       '#PCDATA'.)

       In addition, XML::Filter::DetectWS allows the user to define other whitespace to be <u>ignorable</u>. The
       ignorable whitespace is passed to the PerlSAX Handler with the <b>ignorable_whitespace</b> handler, provided
       that the Handler implements this method. (Otherwise it is passed to the characters handler.)  If the
       <b>SkipIgnorableWS</b> is set, the ignorable whitespace is simply discarded.

       XML::Filter::DetectWS also takes xml:space attributes into account. See below for details.

       CDATA sections are passed in the standard PerlSAX way (i.e. with surrounding start_cdata and end_cdata
       events), unless the Handler does not implement these methods. In that case, the CDATA section is simply
       passed to the characters method.

</pre><h4><b>Constructor</b> <b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       •   SkipIgnorableWS (Default: 0)

           When set, detected ignorable whitespace is discarded.

       •   Handler

           The PerlSAX handler (or filter) that will receive the PerlSAX events from this filter.

</pre><h4><b>Current</b> <b>Implementation</b></h4><pre>
       When  determining  which whitespace is ignorable, it first looks at the xml:space attribute of the parent
       element node (and its ancestors.)  If the attribute value is "preserve", then it is *NOT* ignorable.  (If
       someone took the trouble of adding xml:space="preserve", then that is the final answer...)

       If xml:space="default", then we look at the &lt;!ELEMENT&gt; definition of the parent element. If the model  is
       'EMPTY' or follows the 'Children' rule (i.e. does not contain '#PCDATA') then we know that the whitespace
       is ignorable.  Otherwise we need input from the user somehow.

       The  idea  is  that  the  API  of  DetectWS will be extended, so that you can specify/override e.g. which
       elements should behave as if xml:space="preserve" were set, and/or which elements should behave as if the
       &lt;!ELEMENT&gt; model was defined a certain way, etc.

       Please send feedback!

       The current implementation also detects whitespace after  an  element-start  tag,  whitespace  before  an
       element-end  tag.   It  also  detects whitespace before an element-start and after an element-end tag and
       before  or  after  comments,  processing  instruction,  cdata  sections  etc.,  but  this  needs  to   be
       reimplemented.   In  either  case,  the  detected whitespace is split off into its own PerlSAX characters
       event and an extra property 'Loc' is added. It can have 4 possible values:

       •   1 (WS_START) - whitespace immediately after element-start tag

       •   2 (WS_END) - whitespace just before element-end tag

       •   3 (WS_ONLY) - both WS_START and WS_END, i.e. it's the only text found between the start and  end  tag
           and it's all whitespace

       •   0  (WS_INTER) - none of the above, probably before an element-start tag, after an element-end tag, or
           before or after a comment, PI, cdata section etc.

       Note that WS_INTER may not be that useful, so this may change.

</pre><h4><b>xml:space</b> <b>attribute</b></h4><pre>
       The XML spec states that: A special attribute named xml:space may be attached to an element to signal  an
       intention  that  in  that  element, white space should be preserved by applications.  In valid documents,
       this attribute, like any other, must be declared if it is used.  When declared, it must be  given  as  an
       enumerated type whose only possible values are "default" and "preserve".  For example:

        &lt;!ATTLIST poem   xml:space (default|preserve) 'preserve'&gt;

       The  value  "default"  signals that applications' default white-space processing modes are acceptable for
       this element; the value "preserve" indicates the intent that applications preserve all the  white  space.
       This declared intent is considered to apply to all elements within the content of the element where it is
       specified, unless overridden with another instance of the xml:space attribute.

       The  root  element  of  any  document is considered to have signaled no intentions as regards application
       space handling, unless it provides a value for this attribute or the attribute is declared with a default
       value.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       This code is highly experimental!  It has not been tested well and the API may change.

       The code that detects of blocks of whitespace at potential indent positions may need some work.
