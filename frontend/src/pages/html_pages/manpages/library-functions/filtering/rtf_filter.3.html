</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rtf_filter - filters a chunk of data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;rtfilter.h&gt;</b>

       <b>unsigned</b> <b>int</b> <b>rtf_filter(hfilter</b> <u>filt</u><b>,</b> <b>const</b> <b>void</b> <b>*</b><u>x</u><b>,</b>
                               <b>void</b> <b>*</b><u>y</u><b>,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>int</b> <u>ns</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  function  applies the filter referenced by <u>filt</u> on <u>ns</u> samples specified by the pointer <u>x</u> and writes
       the filtered data into the array pointed by <u>y</u>. The arrays pointed by made of values whose  correspond  to
       the  type  specified at the creation of the filter. In addition, the two arrays <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>overlap</b> (failing
       to comply will lead to undefined results).

       Their number of elements have to be equal to <u>ns</u> multiplied by the number of channels processed (specified
       at the creation of the filter). The arrays should be packed by channels with the following pattern:
                                  |S1C1|S1C2|...|S1Ck|S2C1|S2C2|....|S2Ck|...|SnsCk|
       where SiCj refers to the data value of the i-th sample and the j-th channel and k refers to the number of
       channel specified at the creation of the filter.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns the number of samples written in the array pointer by <u>y</u>. For most of the filters, this value will
       always be equal to <u>ns</u>. This is however not the case of a downsampling filter whose the number of  samples
       returned may vary from one call to another.

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b> <b>CONSIDERATION</b></h4><pre>
       On  platforms  that  support  SIMD instructions, <b>rtf_filter</b>() is implemented in 2 different versions: one
       normal and one using SIMD instruction set which performs nearly  4x  faster  than  the  normal  one  when
       processing  <b>float</b>  data  types.  The  SIMD  version is automatically selected at runtime if the following
       conditions are met (otherwise, the implementation falls back to the normal version):

        - The input <u>x</u> and output <u>y</u> are aligned on 16 bytes boundary (128 bits)

        - The sample strides (the size of the data type multiplied by the number of channel) of  the  input  and
          output are multiples of 16 bytes.

       The  first  condition  is  easily  met by allocating <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> using memory allocation function mandating a
       certain alignment (for example, <b><a href="../man3/posix_memalign.3.html">posix_memalign</a></b>(3) on POSIX platform).

       The second condition is met if the number of channels is carefully chosen.  Given the boost obtained with
       the SIMD version, it is often interesting to  add  unused  channels  into  the  input  and  output  (when
       possible)  just  to  make  the  strides  multiple  of  16 bytes (for example using always a multiple of 4
       channels when dealing with <b>float</b> and real values).
