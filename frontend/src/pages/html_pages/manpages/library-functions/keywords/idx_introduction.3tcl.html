</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       doctools2idx_introduction - DocTools - Keyword indices

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>docidx</u>  (short  for <u>documentation</u> <u>indices</u>) stands for a set of related, yet different, entities which are
       working together for the easy creation and transformation of keyword indices for documentation.

       These are

       [1]    A tcl based language for the semantic markup of a keyword index.  Markup  is  represented  by  Tcl
              commands.  Beginners should start with the <u>docidx</u> <u>language</u> <u>introduction</u>.  The formal specification
              is  split  over  two  documents,  one  dealing with the <u>docidx</u> <u>language</u> <u>syntax</u>, the other a <u>docidx</u>
              <u>language</u> <u>command</u> <u>reference</u>.

       [2]    A set of packages for the programmatic manipulation  of  keyword  indices  in  memory,  and  their
              conversion between various formats, reading and writing. The aforementioned markup language is one
              of the formats which can be both read from and written to.

       [3]    The system for the conversion of indices is based on a plugin mechanism, for this we have two APIs
              describing the interface between the packages above and the import/export plugins.

       Which  of  the  more  detailed documents are relevant to the reader of this introduction depends on their
       role in the documentation process.

       [1]    A <u>writer</u> of documentation has to understand the markup  language  itself.  A  beginner  to  docidx
              should  read  the more informally written <u>docidx</u> <u>language</u> <u>introduction</u> first. Having digested this
              the formal <u>docidx</u> <u>language</u> <u>syntax</u> specification should become understandable. A writer experienced
              with docidx may only need the <u>docidx</u> <u>language</u> <u>command</u> <u>reference</u> from time to time to  refresh  her
              memory.

              While  a  document is written the <b>dtp</b> application can be used to validate it, and after completion
              it also performs the conversion into the chosen system of visual markup, be it *roff, HTML,  plain
              text,  wiki,  etc.  The  simpler  <b>dtplite</b>  application  makes internal use of docidx when handling
              directories of documentation, automatically generating a proper keyword index for them.

       [2]    A <u>processor</u> of documentation written in the <u>docidx</u> markup language has to  know  which  tools  are
              available for use.

              The  main  tool is the aforementioned <b>dtp</b> application provided by Tcllib. The simpler <b>dtplite</b> does
              not expose docidx to the user. At the bottom level, common to both applications, however  we  find
              the  three  packages  providing  the  basic facilities to handle keyword indices, i.e. import from
              textual formats, programmatic manipulation in memory, and export to textual formats. These are

              <b>doctools::idx</b>
                     Programmatic manipulation of keyword indices in memory.

              <b>doctools::idx::import</b>
                     Import of keyword indices from various textual formats. The set  of  supported  formats  is
                     extensible through plugin packages.

              <b>doctools::idx::export</b>
                     Export  of  keyword  indices  to  various  textual formats. The set of supported formats is
                     extensible through plugin packages.

              See also section <b>Package</b> <b>Overview</b> for an overview of the dependencies  between  these  and  other,
              supporting packages.

       [3]    At  last,  but not least, <u>plugin</u> <u>writers</u> have to understand the interaction between the import and
              export packages and their plugins.  These APIs are described in  the  documentation  for  the  two
              relevant packages, i.e.

              •      <b>doctools::idx::import</b>

              •      <b>doctools::idx::export</b>

</pre><h4><b>RELATED</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       The  docidx  format  does  not  stand  alone,  it has two companion formats.  These are called <u>doctoc</u> and
       <u>doctools</u>, and they are intended for the markup of <u>tables</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>contents</u>,  and  of  general  documentation,
       respectively.   They  are  described in their own sets of documents, starting at the <u>DocTools</u> <u>-</u> <u>Tables</u> <u>Of</u>
       <u>Contents</u> and the <u>DocTools</u> <u>-</u> <u>General</u>, respectively.
