</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "Syntax::Keyword::Dynamically" - dynamically change the value of a variable

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use Syntax::Keyword::Dynamically;

          my $logger = ...;

          sub operate
          {
             dynamically $logger-&gt;level = LOG_DEBUG;

             do_things();
          }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a syntax plugin that implements a single keyword, "dynamically", which alters the
       behaviour of a scalar assignment operation.  Syntactically and semantically it is similar to the built-in
       perl keyword "local", but is implemented somewhat differently to give two key advantages over regular
       "local":

       • You can "dynamically" assign to lvalue functions and accessors.

       • You can "dynamically" assign to regular lexical variables.

       Semantically, the behaviour can be considered equivalent to

          {
             my $old = $VAR;
             $VAR = "new value";

             ...

             $VAR = $old;
          }

       Except  that  the  old value will also be restored in the case of exceptions, "goto", "next/last/redo" or
       similar ways to leave the controlling block scope.

</pre><h4><b>KEYWORDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>dynamically</b>
          {
             dynamically LVALUE = EXPR;
             ...
          }

       The "dynamically" keyword modifies the behaviour of the following expression.  which  must  be  a  scalar
       assignment.  Before  the  new  value  is assigned to the lvalue, its current value is captured and stored
       internally within the Perl interpreter. When execution leaves the controlling block for whatever  reason,
       as part of block scope cleanup the saved value is restored.

       The  LVALUE may be any kind of expression that allows normal scalar assignment; lexical or package scalar
       variables, elements of arrays or hashes, or the result of calling an ":lvalue" function or method.

       If the LVALUE has any GET magic associated with it (including a "FETCH" method of  a  tied  scalar)  then
       this will be executed exactly once when the "dynamically" expression is evaluated.

       If  the  LVALUE  has  any SET magic associated with it (including a "STORE" method of a tied scalar) then
       this will be executed exactly once when the "dynamically" expression is evaluated,  and  again  a  second
       time when the controlling scope is unwound.

       When the LVALUE being assigned to is a hash element, e.g. one of the following forms

          dynamically $hash{key} = EXPR;
          dynamically $href-&gt;{key} = EXPR;

       the  assignment  additionally  ensures to remove the key if it is newly-added, and restores by adding the
       key back again if it had been deleted in the meantime.

</pre><h4><b>WITH</b> <b>Future::AsyncAwait</b></h4><pre>
       As of Future::AsyncAwait version 0.32, cross-module  integration  tests  assert  that  the  "dynamically"
       correctly works across an "await" boundary.

          use Future::AsyncAwait;
          use Syntax::Keyword::Dynamically;

          our $var;

          async sub trial
          {
             dynamically $var = "value";

             await func();

             say "Var is still $var";
          }

       When  context-switching  between  scopes  in which a variable is "dynamically" modified, the value of the
       variable will be swapped in and out, possibly multiple times if necessary, to ensure  the  visible  value
       remains as expected.
