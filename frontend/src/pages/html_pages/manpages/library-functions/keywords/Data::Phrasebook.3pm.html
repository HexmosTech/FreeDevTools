</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Data::Phrasebook - Abstract your queries!

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Data::Phrasebook;

           my $q = Data::Phrasebook-&gt;new(
               class  =&gt; 'Plain',
               loader =&gt; 'Text',
               file   =&gt; 'phrases.txt',
           );

           # simple keyword to phrase mapping
           my $phrase = $q-&gt;fetch($keyword);

           # keyword to phrase mapping with parameters
           $q-&gt;delimiters( qr{ \[% \s* (\w+) \s* %\] }x );
           my $phrase = $q-&gt;fetch($keyword,{this =&gt; 'that'});

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Data::Phrasebook is a collection of modules for accessing phrasebooks from various data sources.

</pre><h4><b>PHRASEBOOKS</b></h4><pre>
       To explain what phrasebooks are it is worth reading Rani Pinchuk's (author of Class::Phrasebook) article
       on Perl.com:

       &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/10/22/phrasebook.html">http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/10/22/phrasebook.html</a>&gt;

       Common uses of phrasebooks are in handling error codes, accessing databases via SQL queries and written
       language phrases. Examples are the mime.types file and the hosts file, both of which use a simple
       phrasebook design.

       Unfortunately Class::Phrasebook is a complete work and not a true class based framework. If you can't
       install XML libraries, you cannot use it.  This distribution is a collaboration between Iain Truskett and
       myself to create an extendable and class based framework for implementing phrasebooks.

</pre><h4><b>CLASSES</b></h4><pre>
       In creating a phrasebook object, a class type is required. This class defines the nature of the
       phrasebook or the behaviours associated with it. Currently there are two classes, Plain and SQL.

       The Plain class is the default class, and allows retrieval of phrases via the <b>fetch()</b> method. The <b>fetch()</b>
       simply returns the phrase that maps to the given keyword.

       The SQL class allows specific database handling. Phrases are retrieved via the <b>query()</b> method. The
       <b>query()</b> method internally retrieves the SQL phrase, then returns the statement handler object, which the
       user can then perform a prepare/execute/fetch/finish sequence on. For more details see
       Data::Phrasebook::SQL.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       The arguments to new depend upon the exact class you're creating.

       The default class is "Plain" and only requires the Loader arguments. The "SQL" class requires a database
       handle as well as the Loader arguments.

       The "class" argument defines the object class of the phrasebook and the behaviours that can be associated
       with it. Using "Foobar" as a fake class, the class module is searched for in the following order:

       1.  If  you've  subclassed  "Data::Phrasebook", for example as "Dictionary", then "Dictionary::Foobar" is
           tried.

       2.  If that failed, "Data::Phrasebook::Foobar" is tried.

       3.  If <b>that</b> failed, "Foobar" is tried.

       4.  If all the above failed, we croak.

       This should allow you some flexibility in what sort of classes you use while  not  having  you  type  too
       much.

       For other parameters, see the specific class you wish to instantiate.  The class argument is removed from
       the arguments list and the "new" method of the specified class is called with the remaining arguments.

</pre><h4><b>DELIMITERS</b></h4><pre>
       Delimiters  allow  for variable substitution in the phrase. The default style is ':variable', which would
       be passed as:

           $q-&gt;delimiters( qr{ :(\w+) }x );

       As an alternative, a Template Toolkit style would be passed as:

           $q-&gt;delimiters( qr{ \[% \s* (\w+) \s* %\] }x );

</pre><h4><b>DICTIONARIES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Simple</b> <b>Dictionaries</b>
       Data::Phrasebook supports the use of dictionaries. See the specific Loader module to see how to implement
       the dictionary within your phrasebook. Using Data::Phrasebook::Loader::Ini as an example, the  dictionary
       might be laid out as:

         [Stuff]
         language=Perl
         platform=Linux

         [Nonsense]
         platform=Windows

       The phrasebook object is then created and used as:

         my $q = Data::Phrasebook-&gt;new(
           class  =&gt; 'Plain',
           loader =&gt; 'Ini',
           file   =&gt; 'phrases.ini',
           dict   =&gt; 'Nonsense',
         );

         my $language = $q-&gt;fetch('language'); # retrieves 'Perl'
         my $platform = $q-&gt;fetch('platform'); # retrieves 'Windows'

       The  former  is  from  the  default  (first)  dictionary,  and  the  second  is from the named dictionary
       ('Nonsense'). If a phrase is not found in the named dictionary an attempt is  made  to  find  it  in  the
       default dictionary. Otherwise undef will be returned.

       Once a dictionary or file is specified, changing either requires reloading. As this is done at the loader
       stage,  we need to let it know what it needs to reload. This can be done with the either (or both) of the
       following:

         $q-&gt;file('phrases2.ini');
         $q-&gt;dict('Stuff');

       A subsequent <b>fetch()</b> will then reload the file and dictionary, before  retrieving  the  phrase  required.
       However,  a reload only takes place if both the file and the dictionary passed are not the ones currently
       loaded.

   <b>Multiple</b> <b>Dictionaries</b>
       As of version 0.25, the  ability  to  provide  prescendence  over  multiple  dictionaries  for  the  same
       phrasebook. Using Data::Phrasebook::Loader::Ini again as an example, the phrasebook might be laid out as:

         [AndTheOther]
         language=Perl
         platform=Linux
         network=LAN

         [That]
         platform=Solaris
         network=WLAN

         [This]
         platform=Windows

       The phrasebook object is then created and used as:

         my $q = Data::Phrasebook-&gt;new(
           class  =&gt; 'Plain',
           loader =&gt; 'Ini',
           file   =&gt; 'phrases.ini',
           dict   =&gt; ['This','That','AndTheOther'],
         );

         my $language = $q-&gt;fetch('language'); # retrieves 'Perl'
         my $platform = $q-&gt;fetch('platform'); # retrieves 'Windows'
         my $network  = $q-&gt;fetch('nework');   # retrieves 'WLAN'

       The  first  dictionary, if not specified and supported by the Loader module, is still used as the default
       dictionary.

       The dictionaries can be specified, or reordered, using the object method:

         $q-&gt;dict('That','AndTheOther','This');

       A subsequent reload will occur with the next fetch call.

</pre><h4><b>DEDICATION</b></h4><pre>
       Much of the code for the original class framework is from Iain's original code.  My code was much simpler
       and was tied to using just an INI data source. Merging all the ideas and code together we  came  up  with
       this distribution.

       Unfortunately  Iain died in December 2003, so he never got to see or play with the final working version.
       I can only thank him for his thoughts and ideas in getting this  distribution  into  a  state  worthy  of
       release.
