       FCGI::EV - Implement FastCGI protocol for use in EV-based applications

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes FCGI::EV version v2.0.1

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use FCGI::EV;
        use Some::FCGI::EV::Handler;

        # while in EV::loop, accept incoming connection from web server into
        # $sock, then start handling FastCGI protocol on that connection,
        # using Some::FCGI::EV::Handler for processing CGI requests:
        FCGI::EV-&gt;new($sock, 'Some::FCGI::EV::Handler');

        #
        # EXAMPLE: complete FastCGI server (without error handling code)
        #          use FCGI::EV::Std handler (download separately from CPAN)
        #

        use Socket;
        use Fcntl;
        use EV;
        use FCGI::EV;
        use FCGI::EV::Std;

        my $path = '/tmp/fastcgi.sock';

        socket my $srvsock, AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0;
        unlink $path;
        my $umask = umask 0;   # ensure 0777 perms for unix socket
        bind $srvsock, sockaddr_un($path);
        umask $umask;
        listen $srvsock, SOMAXCONN;
        fcntl $srvsock, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK;

        my $w = EV::io $srvsock, EV::READ, sub {
           accept my($sock), $srvsock;
           fcntl $sock, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK;
           FCGI::EV-&gt;new($sock, 'FCGI::EV::Std');
        };

        EV::loop;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implement FastCGI protocol for use in EV-based applications.  (That mean you have to run
       EV::loop in your application or this module will not work.)

       It receive and parse data from web server, pack and send data to web server, but it doesn't process CGI
       requests received from web server - instead it delegate this work to another module called 'handler'. For
       one example of such handler, see FCGI::EV::Std.

       FCGI::EV work using non-blocking sockets and initially was designed to use in event-based CGI
       applications (which able to handle multiple parallel CGI requests in single process without
       threads/fork). This require from CGI to avoid any operations which may block, like using SQL database -
       instead CGI should delegate all such tasks to remote services and talk to these services in non-blocking
       mode.

       It also possible to use it to run usual CGI.pm-based applications. If you will do this using
       FCGI::EV::Std handler, then only one CGI request will be executed at a time (which is probably not what
       you expect from FastCGI!), because FCGI::EV::Std doesn't implement any process-manager.  But it's
       possible to develop another handlers for FCGI::EV, which will support process-management and so will
       handle multiple CGI request in parallel.

       This module doesn't require from user to use CGI.pm - any module for parsing CGI params can be used in
       general (details depends on used FCGI::EV handler module).

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           FCGI::EV-&gt;new( $sock, $class );

       Start talking FastCGI protocol on $sock (which should be socket open to just-connected web server), and
       use $class to handle received CGI requests.

       Module $class should implement "FCGI::EV handler" interface. You can use either FCGI::EV::Std from CPAN
       or develop your own.

       Return nothing. (Created FCGI::EV object will work in background and will be automatically destroyed
       after finishing I/O with web server.)

</pre><h4><b>HANDLER</b> <b>CLASS</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       Handler class (which name provided in $class parameter to FCGI::EV-&gt;<b>new()</b>) must implement this interface:

       new( $server, \%env )
           When  FCGI::EV  object  receive  initial  part  of  CGI  request (environment variables) it will call
           $handler_class-&gt;<b>new()</b> to create handler object which should process that CGI request.

           Parameter $server is FCGI::EV object itself. It's required to send CGI reply.  WARNING!  Handler  may
           keep only <b>weaken()</b> reference to $server!

           After  calling  <b>new()</b> FCGI::EV object ($server) will continue receiving STDIN content from web server
           and will call $handler-&gt;<b>stdin()</b> each time it get next part of STDIN.

       stdin( $data, $is_eof )
           The $data is next chunk of STDIN received from web server. Flag $is_eof will be  true  if  $data  was
           last part of STDIN.

           Usually handler shouldn't begin processing CGI request until all content of STDIN will be received.

       DESTROY
           This  method  is  optional.  It  will  be called when connection to web server is closed and FCGI::EV
           object going to die (but it's still exists when DESTROY is called -  except  if  DESTROY  was  called
           while global destruction stage).

           Handler object may use DESTROY to interrupt current CGI request if web server close connection before
           CGI send it reply.

   <b>SENDING</b> <b>CGI</b> <b>REPLY</b>
       After  handler  got  %env  (in  <b>new()</b>)  and complete STDIN (in one or more calls of <b>stdin()</b>) it may start
       handling this CGI request and prepare reply to send to web server. To send this data it should use method
       $server-&gt;<b>stdout()</b>, where $server is object given to <b>new()</b> while creating handler object (it  should  keep
       weak reference to $server inside to be able to reply).

       stdout( $data, $is_eof )
           CGI may send reply in one or more parts. Last part should have $is_eof set to true. DESTROY method of
           handler object will be called shortly after handler object will do $server-&gt;stdout( $data, 1 ).

   <b>HANDLER</b> <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       This  handler  will  process  CGI  requests  one-by-one  (i.e.  in  blocking  mode).  On request function
       <b>main::main()</b> will be executed. That function may use standard CGI.pm module to get request parameters and
       send it reply using usual print to STDOUT.

       There no error-handling code in this example, see FCGI::EV::Std for more details.

        package FCGI::EV::ExampleHandler;

        use Scalar::Util qw( weaken );
        use CGI::Stateless; # needed to re-init CGI.pm state between requests

        sub new {
           my ($class, $server, $env) = @_;
           my $self = bless {
               server  =&gt; $server,
               env     =&gt; $env,
               stdin   =&gt; q{},
           }, $class;
           weaken($self-&gt;{server});
           return $self;
        }

        sub stdin {
           my ($self, $stdin, $is_eof) = @_;
           $self-&gt;{stdin} .= $stdin;
           if ($is_eof) {
               local *STDIN;
               open STDIN, '&lt;', \$self-&gt;{stdin};
               local %ENV = %{ $self-&gt;{env} };
               local $CGI::Q = CGI::Stateless-&gt;new();
               local *STDOUT;
               my $reply = q{};
               open STDOUT, '&gt;', \$reply;
               main::main();
               $self-&gt;{server}-&gt;stdout($reply, 1);
           }
           return;
        }

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       There no errors returned in any way by this module, but there few warning messages may be printed:

       "FCGI::EV: IO: %s"
           While doing I/O with web server error %s happened and connection was closed.

       "FCGI::EV: %s"
           While parsing data from web server error %s happened and connection was closed.  (That error probably
           mean bug either in web server or this module.)
