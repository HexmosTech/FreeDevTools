</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       popen — initiate pipe streams to or from a process

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;

       FILE *popen(const char *<u>command</u>, const char *<u>mode</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>popen</u>()  function shall execute the command specified by the string <u>command</u>.  It shall create a pipe
       between the calling program and the executed command, and shall return a pointer to a stream that can  be
       used to either read from or write to the pipe.

       The  environment  of  the executed command shall be as if a child process were created within the <u>popen</u>()
       call using the <u>fork</u>() function, and the child invoked the <u>sh</u> utility using the call:

           execl(<u>shell</u> <u>path</u>, "sh", "-c", <u>command</u>, (char *)0);

       where <u>shell</u> <u>path</u> is an unspecified pathname for the <u>sh</u> utility.

       The <u>popen</u>() function shall ensure that any streams from previous <u>popen</u>() calls that remain  open  in  the
       parent process are closed in the new child process.

       The <u>mode</u> argument to <u>popen</u>() is a string that specifies I/O mode:

        1. If  <u>mode</u>  is  <u>r</u>,  when  the  child process is started, its file descriptor STDOUT_FILENO shall be the
           writable end of the pipe, and the file descriptor <u>fileno</u>(<u>stream</u>) in the calling process, where <u>stream</u>
           is the stream pointer returned by <u>popen</u>(), shall be the readable end of the pipe.

        2. If <u>mode</u> is <u>w</u>, when the child process is  started  its  file  descriptor  STDIN_FILENO  shall  be  the
           readable end of the pipe, and the file descriptor <u>fileno</u>(<u>stream</u>) in the calling process, where <u>stream</u>
           is the stream pointer returned by <u>popen</u>(), shall be the writable end of the pipe.

        3. If <u>mode</u> is any other value, the result is unspecified.

       After  <u>popen</u>(),  both the parent and the child process shall be capable of executing independently before
       either terminates.

       Pipe streams are byte-oriented.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, <u>popen</u>() shall return a pointer to an open stream that can be used to read  or
       write to the pipe. Otherwise, it shall return a null pointer and may set <u>errno</u> to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>popen</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EMFILE</b> {STREAM_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling process.

       The <u>popen</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EMFILE</b> {FOPEN_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling process.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The <u>mode</u> argument is invalid.

       The <u>popen</u>() function may also set <u>errno</u> values as described by <u>fork</u>() or <u>pipe</u>().

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Using</b> <b>popen()</b> <b>to</b> <b>Obtain</b> <b>a</b> <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>Files</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ls</b> <b>Utility</b>
       The following example demonstrates the use of <u>popen</u>() and <u>pclose</u>() to execute the command <u>ls</u>* in order to
       obtain a list of files in the current directory:

           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;
           ...

           FILE *fp;
           int status;
           char path[PATH_MAX];

           fp = popen("ls *", "r");
           if (fp == NULL)
               /* Handle error */;

           while (fgets(path, PATH_MAX, fp) != NULL)
               printf("%s", path);

           status = pclose(fp);
           if (status == -1) {
               /* Error reported by pclose() */
               ...
           } else {
               /* Use macros described under wait() to inspect `status' in order
                  to determine success/failure of command executed by popen() */
               ...
           }

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Since  open  files are shared, a mode <u>r</u> command can be used as an input filter and a mode <u>w</u> command as an
       output filter.

       Buffered  reading  before  opening  an  input  filter  may  leave  the  standard  input  of  that  filter
       mispositioned.  Similar  problems  with an output filter may be prevented by careful buffer flushing; for
       example, with <u>fflush</u>().

       A stream opened by <u>popen</u>() should be closed by <u>pclose</u>().

       The behavior of <u>popen</u>() is specified for values of <u>mode</u> of <u>r</u> and <u>w</u>.  Other modes such as <u>rb</u> and <u>wb</u>  might
       be  supported by specific implementations, but these would not be portable features. Note that historical
       implementations of <u>popen</u>() only check to see if the first character of <u>mode</u> is <u>r</u>.  Thus, a <u>mode</u> of <u>robert</u>
       <u>the</u> <u>robot</u> would be treated as <u>mode</u> <u>r</u>, and a <u>mode</u> of <u>anything</u> <u>else</u> would be treated as <u>mode</u> <u>w</u>.

       If the application calls <u>waitpid</u>() or <u>waitid</u>() with a <u>pid</u> argument greater than 0, and  it  still  has  a
       stream  that  was called with <u>popen</u>() open, it must ensure that <u>pid</u> does not refer to the process started
       by <u>popen</u>().

       To determine whether or not the environment specified in the Shell and Utilities volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       is present, use the function call:

           sysconf(_SC_2_VERSION)

       (See <u>sysconf</u>()).

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>popen</u>()  function  should  not  be used by programs that have set user (or group) ID privileges. The
       <u>fork</u>() and <u>exec</u> family of functions (except <u>execlp</u>() and <u>execvp</u>()), should be used instead. This prevents
       any unforeseen manipulation of the environment of the user that could cause  execution  of  commands  not
       anticipated by the calling program.

       If the original and <u>popen</u>()ed processes both intend to read or write or read and write a common file, and
       either  will  be  using  FILE-type C functions (<u>fread</u>(), <u>fwrite</u>(), and so on), the rules for sharing file
       handles must be observed (see <u>Section</u> <u>2.5.1</u>, <u>Interaction</u> <u>of</u> <u>File</u> <u>Descriptors</u> <u>and</u> <u>Standard</u> <u>I/O</u> <u>Streams</u>).
