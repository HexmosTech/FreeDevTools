       SOAP::Fault - encapsulates SOAP faults prior to their serialization or after their deserialization

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class encapsulates SOAP faults prior to their serialization or after their deserialization. The
       methods available are a constructor and four accessors. Each accessor creates an object on demand, just
       as the other classes do, when called as a static method. Like other accessors in the SOAP::Lite package,
       they return the object itself when setting the attribute.

</pre><h4><b>GENERATING</b> <b>A</b> <b>SOAP</b> <b>FAULT</b></h4><pre>
       To generate a SOAP Fault simply issue a Perl die command on the server side as you might normally. The
       SOAP processor will intercept the die command and return a SOAP Fault, using the string passed to the die
       command as the faultstring, to the client making the call. If you require having more control over the
       SOAP Fault returned to the client, then simply pass a SOAP::Fault object to the die command and the SOAP
       processor will behave accordingly. For example:

         die SOAP::Fault-&gt;faultcode('Server.Custom') # will be qualified
                        -&gt;faultstring('Died in server method')
                        -&gt;faultdetail(bless {code =&gt; 1} =&gt; 'BadError')
                        -&gt;faultactor('<a href="http://www.soaplite.com/custom">http://www.soaplite.com/custom</a>');

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new(optional data)
               $fault = SOAP::Fault-&gt;new(faultcode =&gt; 'Server');

           Explicitly  creates a new SOAP::Fault object. Any of the four attributes represented next by accessor
           methods may be passed in the argument list with values immediately following their attribute name.

       faultcode(optional value)
               $fault-&gt;faultcode('MethodUnknown');

           Returns the current fault code or sets it if a value is given.

       faultstring(optional value)
               $fault-&gt;faultstring("There is no $method here");

           Returns or sets the fault string.

       faultactor(optional value)
               $fault-&gt;faultcode($header-&gt;actor);

           Returns or sets the fault-actor element. Note that the actor isn't always required in a SOAP fault.

       faultdetail(optional value)
               $fault-&gt;faultcode(bless { proxy =&gt; $ip }, 'Err');

           Returns or sets the fault's detail element. Like the actor, this isn't  always  a  required  element.
           Note  that fault detail content in a message is represented as tag blocks. Thus, the values passed to
           this accessor when setting the value are either SOAP::Data objects,  or  more  general  blessed  hash
           references.

       In  addition  to these methods, the SOAP::Fault package also provides detail as an alias for faultdetail.
       The former is the actual name of the element with SOAP faults, but the latter name is less ambiguous when
       regarded with  the  rest  of  the  SOAP::Lite  package.  Objects  of  this  class  also  have  a  special
       stringification  enabled.  If  an  object  is  printed  or  otherwise  stringified, the value produced is
       faultcode: faultstring, with the attribute values of the object.
