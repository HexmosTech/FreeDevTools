</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Data::Stream::Bulk - N at a time iteration API

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.11

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               # get a bulk stream from somewere
               my $s = Data::Stream::Bulk::Foo-&gt;new( ... );

               # can be used like this:
               until ( $s-&gt;is_done ) {
                       foreach my $item ( $s-&gt;items ) {
                               process($item);
                       }
               }

               # or like this:
               while( my $block = $s-&gt;next ) {
                       foreach my $item ( @$block ) {
                               process($item);
                       }
               }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module tries to find middle ground between one at a time and all at once processing of data sets.

       The purpose of this module is to avoid the overhead of implementing an iterative api when this isn't
       necessary, without breaking forward compatibility in case that becomes necessary later on.

       The API optimizes for when a data set typically fits in memory and is returned as an array, but the
       consumer cannot assume that the data set is bounded.

       The API is destructive in order to minimize the chance that resultsets are leaked due to improper usage.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Required</b> <b>Methods</b>
       The API requires two methods to be implemented:

       is_done
           Should return true if the stream is exhausted.

           As  long  as  this  method  returns  a false value (not done) "next" could potentially return another
           block.

       next
           Returns the next block.

           Note that "next" is not guaranteed to return an array reference, even  if  "is_done"  returned  false
           prior to calling it.

   <b>Convenience</b> <b>Methods</b>
       items
           This method calls "next" and dereferences the result if there are pending items.

       all Force evaluation of the entire resultset.

           Note that for large data sets this might cause swap thrashing of various other undesired effects. Use
           with caution.

       cat @streams
           Concatenates this stream with @streams, returning a single stream.

       list_cat @tail
           Returns a possibly cleaned up list of streams.

           Used by "cat".

           Overridden  by  Data::Stream::Bulk::Array,  Data::Stream::Bulk::Cat  and  Data::Stream::Bulk::Nil  to
           implement some simple short circuiting.

       filter $filter
           Applies a per-block block filter to the stream.

           Returns a possibly new stream with the filtering layered.

           $filter is invoked once per block and should return an array reference to the filtered block.

       chunk $chunk_size
           Chunks the input stream so that each block returned by "next" will have at least $chunk_size items.

       loaded
           Should be overridden to return true if all the items are already  realized  (e.g.   in  the  case  of
           Data::Stream::Bulk::Array).

           Returns false by default.

           When true calling "all" is supposed to be safe (memory usage should be in the same order of magnitude
           as stream's own usage).

           This is typically useful when tranforming an array is easier than transorming a stream (e.g. optional
           duplicate filtering).

</pre><h4><b>CLASSES</b></h4><pre>
       Data::Stream::Bulk::Array
           This  class  is not a stream at all, but just one block. When the data set easily fits in memory this
           class can be used, while retaining forward compatibility with larger data sets.

       Data::Stream::Bulk::Callback
           Callback driven iteration.

       Data::Stream::Bulk::Chunked
           Wrapper to return larger blocks from an existing stream.

       Data::Stream::Bulk::DBI
           Bulk fetching of data from DBI statement handles.

       Data::Stream::Bulk::DBIC
           DBIx::Class::ResultSet iteration.

       Data::Stream::Bulk::FileHandle
           Iterates over lines in a text file.

       Data::Stream::Bulk::Nil
           An empty result set.

       Data::Stream::Bulk::Cat
           A concatenation of several streams.

       Data::Stream::Bulk::Filter
           A filter wrapping a stream.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       Sorted streams
           Add a hint for sorted streams (like "loaded" but as an attribute in the base role).

           Introduce a "merge" operation for merging of sorted streams.

           Optimize "unique" to make use of sorting hints for constant space uniquing.

       More utility functions
           To assist in proccessing and creating streams.
