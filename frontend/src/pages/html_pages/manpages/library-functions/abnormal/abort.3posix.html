</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       abort — generate an abnormal process abort

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;

       void abort(void);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  <u>abort</u>()  function  shall  cause  abnormal process termination to occur, unless the signal SIGABRT is
       being caught and the signal handler does not return.

       The abnormal termination processing shall include the default actions defined for SIGABRT and may include
       an attempt to effect <u>fclose</u>() on all open streams.

       The SIGABRT signal shall be sent to the calling process as if by  means  of  <u>raise</u>()  with  the  argument
       SIGABRT.

       The  status  made  available  to  <u>wait</u>(),  <u>waitid</u>(),  or  <u>waitpid</u>() by <u>abort</u>() shall be that of a process
       terminated by the SIGABRT signal.  The <u>abort</u>() function shall override blocking or ignoring  the  SIGABRT
       signal.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>abort</u>() function shall not return.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Catching  the  signal  is  intended  to  provide the application developer with a portable means to abort
       processing, free from possible interference from any implementation-supplied functions.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard requires the <u>abort</u>() function to be async-signal-safe. Since  POSIX.1‐2008
       defers  to  the ISO C standard, this required a change to the DESCRIPTION from ``shall include the effect
       of <u>fclose</u>()'' to ``may include an attempt to effect <u>fclose</u>().''

       The revised wording permits some backwards-compatibility and avoids a potential deadlock situation.

       The Open Group Base Resolution bwg2002‐003 is applied, removing the following XSI shaded  paragraph  from
       the DESCRIPTION:

       ``On  XSI-conformant systems, in addition the abnormal termination processing shall include the effect of
       <u>fclose</u>() on message catalog descriptors.''

       There were several reasons to remove this paragraph:

        *  No special processing of open message catalogs needs  to  be  performed  prior  to  abnormal  process
           termination.

        *  The  main reason to specifically mention that <u>abort</u>() includes the effect of <u>fclose</u>() on open streams
           is to flush output queued on the  stream.  Message  catalogs  in  this  context  are  read-only  and,
           therefore, do not need to be flushed.

        *  The  effect  of  <u>fclose</u>() on a message catalog descriptor is unspecified. Message catalog descriptors
           are allowed, but not required to be implemented using a file descriptor, but there is no  mention  in
           POSIX.1‐2008  of  a  message  catalog  descriptor using a standard I/O stream FILE object as would be
           expected by <u>fclose</u>().

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
