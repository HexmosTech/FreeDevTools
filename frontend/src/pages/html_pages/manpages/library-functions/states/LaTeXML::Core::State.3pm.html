</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "LaTeXML::Core::State" - stores the current state of processing.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A "LaTeXML::Core::State" object stores the current state of processing.  It recording catcodes, variables
       values, definitions and so forth, as well as mimicking TeX's scoping rules.

   <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>Processing</b>
       "$STATE-&gt;getStomach;"
           Returns the current Stomach used for digestion.

       "$STATE-&gt;getModel;"
           Returns the current Model representing the document model.

   <b>Scoping</b>
       The  assignment  methods,  described  below,  generally  take a $scope argument, which determines how the
       assignment is made.  The allowed values and their implications are:

        global   : global assignment.
        local    : local assignment, within the current grouping.
        undef    : global if \global preceded, else local (default)
        &lt;name&gt;   : stores the assignment in a `scope' which
                   can be loaded later.

       If no scoping is specified, then the assignment will be global if  a  preceding  "\global"  has  set  the
       global flag, otherwise the value will be assigned within the current grouping.

       "$STATE-&gt;pushFrame;"
           Starts   a   new   level   of   grouping.   Note  that  this  is  lower  level  than  "\bgroup";  See
           LaTeXML::Core::Stomach.

       "$STATE-&gt;popFrame;"
           Ends  the  current  level  of  grouping.   Note  that  this  is  lower  level  than  "\egroup";   See
           LaTeXML::Core::Stomach.

       "$STATE-&gt;setPrefix($prefix);"
           Sets a prefix (eg. "global" for "\global", etc) for the next operation, if applicable.

       "$STATE-&gt;clearPrefixes;"
           Clears any prefixes.

   <b>Values</b>
       "$value = $STATE-&gt;lookupValue($name);"
           Lookup the current value associated with the the string $name.

       "$STATE-&gt;assignValue($name,$value,$scope);"
           Assign $value to be associated with the the string $name, according to the given scoping rule.

           Values  are  also used to specify most configuration parameters (which can therefore also be scoped).
           The recognized configuration parameters are:

            STRICT            : whether errors (eg. undefined macros)
                                are fatal.
            INCLUDE_COMMENTS  : whether to preserve comments in the
                                source, and to add occasional line
                                number comments. (Default true).
            PRESERVE_NEWLINES : whether newlines in the source should
                                be preserved (not 100% TeX-like).
                                By default this is true.
            SEARCHPATHS       : a list of directories to search for
                                sources, implementations, etc.

       "$STATE-&gt;pushValue($name,$value);"
           This is like "-&gt;assign", but pushes a value onto the end of the stored value, which should be a  LIST
           reference.   Scoping  is not handled here (yet?), it simply pushes the value onto the last binding of
           $name.

       "$boole = $STATE-&gt;isValuebound($type,$name,$frame);"
           Returns whether the value $name is bound. If  $frame is given, check  whether  it  is  bound  in  the
           $frame-th frame, with 0 being the top frame.

   <b>Category</b> <b>Codes</b>
       "$value = $STATE-&gt;lookupCatcode($char);"
           Lookup the current catcode associated with the the character $char.

       "$STATE-&gt;assignCatcode($char,$catcode,$scope);"
           Set $char to have the given $catcode, with the assignment made according to the given scoping rule.

           This  method  is  also  used  to  specify  whether a given character is active in math mode, by using
           "math:$char" for the character, and using a value of 1 to specify that it is active.

   <b>Definitions</b>
       "$defn = $STATE-&gt;lookupMeaning($token);"
           Get the "meaning" currently associated with $token,  either  the  definition  (if  it  is  a  control
           sequence or active character)
            or the token itself if it shouldn't be executable.  (See LaTeXML::Core::Definition)

       "$STATE-&gt;assignMeaning($token,$defn,$scope);"
           Set  the  definition associated with $token to $defn.  If $globally is true, it makes this the global
           definition  rather  than  bound  within  the  current  group.   (See  LaTeXML::Core::Definition,  and
           LaTeXML::Package)

       "$STATE-&gt;installDefinition($definition, $scope);"
           Install the definition into the current stack frame under its normal control sequence.

   <b>Named</b> <b>Scopes</b>
       Named  scopes  can  be  used to set variables or redefine control sequences within a scope other than the
       standard TeX grouping. For example, the LaTeX implementation will automatically activate any  definitions
       that were defined with a named scope of, say "section:4", during the portion of the document that has the
       section  counter  equal  to 4.  Similarly, a scope named "label:foo" will be activated in portions of the
       document where "\label{foo}" is in effect.

       "$STATE-&gt;activateScope($scope);"
           Installs any definitions that were associated with the named $scope.  Note that these are  placed  in
           the current grouping frame and will disappear when that grouping ends.

       "$STATE-&gt;deactivateScope($scope);"
           Removes  any  definitions  that  were associated with the named $scope.  Normally not needed, since a
           scopes definitions are locally bound anyway.

       "$sp = $STATE-&gt;convertUnit($unit);"
           Converts a TeX unit of the form '10em' (or whatever TeX unit)  into  scaled  points.   (Defined  here
           since in principle it could track the size of ems and so forth (but currently doesn't))
