       CPAN::SQLite::State - get state information on the database

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.220

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module gets information on the current state of the database and compares it to that obtained from
       the CPAN index files from <u>CPAN::SQLite::Info</u> and from the repositories from <u>CPAN::SQLite::PPM</u>. For each
       of the four tables <u>dists</u>, <u>mods</u>, <u>auths</u>, and <u>ppms</u>, two methods are used to get this information:

       •  "ids"

          This method gets the ids of the relevant names, and versions, if applicable, in the table.

       •  "state"

          This  method  compares  the  information in the tables obtained from the "ids" method to that from the
          CPAN indices and ppm repositories. One of three actions is then decided, which is  subsequently  acted
          upon in <u>CPAN::SQLite::Populate</u>.

          •  "insert"

             If the information in the indices is not in the database, this information is marked for insertion.

          •  "update"

             If  the  information  in the database is older than that form the indices (generally, this means an
             older version), the information is marked for updating.

          •  "delete"

             If the information in the database is no longer present in the indices, the information  is  marked
             for deletion.
