</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "Net::Async::Matrix::Room::State" - represents the state events in a matrix room

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Instances of this class represent all of the known state events in a Net::Async::Matrix::Room at some
       instant in time. These objects are mutable so a "live" state object obtained from a room will change to
       keep track of newly received state events.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>get_event</b>
          $event = $state-&gt;get_event( $type, $state_key )

       Returns a HASH reference containing the raw event stored for the given type name and optional state key.

   <b>get_events</b>
          $events = $state-&gt;get_events( $type )

       Returns a multi-level HASH reference mapping all of the known state keys for a given event type name to
       their raw stored events. Typically this is useful for "m.room.member" events as the state keys will be
       user IDs.

</pre><h4><b>CONVENIENCE</b> <b>ACCESSORS</b></h4><pre>
       The following accessors all fetch single values out of certain events, as they are commonly used.

   <b>name</b>
          $name = $state-&gt;name

       Returns the "name" field of the "m.room.name" event, if it exists.

   <b>join_rule</b>
          $join_rule = $state-&gt;join_rule

       Returns the "join_rule" field of the "m.room.join_rules" event, if it exists.

   <b>topic</b>
          $topic = $state-&gt;topic

       Returns the "topic" field of the "m.room.topic" event, if it exists.

   <b>aliases</b>
          @aliases = $state-&gt;aliases

       Returns a list of the room alias from all the "m.room.aliases" events, in no particular order.

   <b>members</b>
          @members = $state-&gt;members

       Returns a list of Member instances representing all of the members of the room from the "m.room.member"
       events whose membership state is not "leave".

   <b>all_members</b>
          @members = $state-&gt;members

       Similar to "members" but even includes members in "leave" state. This is not normally what you want.

   <b>member</b>
          $member = $state-&gt;member( $user_id )

       Returns a Member instance representing a room member of the given user ID, or "undef" if none exists.

   <b>member_level</b>
          $level = $state-&gt;member_level( $user_id )

       Returns a number indicating the power level that the given user ID would have according to room state,
       taken from the "m.room.power_levels" event. This takes into account the "users_default" field, if no
       specific level exists for the given user ID.
