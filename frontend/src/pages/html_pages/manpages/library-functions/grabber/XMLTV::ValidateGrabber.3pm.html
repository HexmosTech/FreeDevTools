</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XMLTV::ValidateGrabber - Validates an XMLTV grabber

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Utility library that validates that a grabber properly implements the capabilities described at

       <a href="http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/XmltvCapabilities">http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/XmltvCapabilities</a>

       The ValidateGrabber call first asks the grabber which capabilities it claims to support and then
       validates that it actually does support these capabilities.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTED</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All these functions are exported on demand.

       ConfigureGrabber
               ConfigureGrabber( "./tv_grab_new", "./tv_grab_new.conf" )

       ValidateGrabber
           Run the validation for a grabber.

               ValidateGrabber( "tv_grab_new", "./tv_grab_new", "./tv_grab_new.conf",
                                "/tmp/new_", "./blib/share", 0 )

           ValidateGrabber takes the following parameters:

           •   a short name for the grabber. This is only used when printing error messages.

           •   the command to run the grabber.

           •   the name of a configuration-file for the grabber.

           •   a file-prefix that is added to all output-files.

           •   a  path  to a directory with metadata for the grabber. This path is passed to the grabber via the
               --share option if the grabber supports the capability 'share'.  undef  if  no  --share  parameter
               shall be used.

           •   a boolean specifying if the --cache parameter shall be used for grabbers that support the 'cache'
               capability.

           ValidateGrabber returns a list of errors that it found with the grabber. Each error takes the form of
           a keyword:

           noparamcheck
               The grabber accepts any parameter without returning an error-code.

           noversion
               The grabber returns an error when run with --version.

           nodescription
               The grabber returns an error when run with --description.

           nocapabilities
               The grabber returns an error when run with --capabilities.

           nobaseline
               The grabber does not list 'baseline' as one of its supported capabilities.

           nomanualconfig
               The grabber does not list 'manualconfig' as one of its supported capabilities.

           noconfigurationfile
               The specified configuration-file does not exist.

           graberror
               The grabber returned with an error-code when asked to grab data.

           notquiet
               The grabber printed something to STDERR even though the --quiet option was used.

           outputdiffers
               The  grabber  produced  different  output when called with different combinations of --output and
               --quiet.

           caterror
               tv_cat returned an error-code when we asked it to process the output from the grabber.

           sorterror
               tv_sort found errors in the data generated by the grabber. Probably overlapping programmes.

           notadditive
               grabbing data for tomorrow first and then for the day after tomorrow and concatenating them  does
               not yield the same result as grabbing the data for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow at once.

           Additionally,  the  list of errors will contain error keywords from XMLTV::ValidateFile if the xmltv-
           file generated by the grabber was not valid.

           If no errors are found, an empty list is returned.
