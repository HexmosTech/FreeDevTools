       File::Basename - Parse file paths into directory, filename and suffix.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use File::Basename;

           my ($name, $path, $suffix) = fileparse($fullname, @suffixlist);
           my $name = fileparse($fullname, @suffixlist);

           my $basename = basename($fullname, @suffixlist);
           my $dirname  = dirname($fullname);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These routines allow you to parse file paths into their directory, filename and suffix.

       <b>NOTE</b>: dirname() and basename() emulate the behaviours, and quirks, of the shell and C functions of the
       same name.  See each function's documentation for details.  If your concern is just parsing paths it is
       safer to use File::Spec's splitpath() and splitdir() methods.

       It is guaranteed that

           # Where $path_separator is / for Unix, \ for Windows, etc...
           dirname($path) . $path_separator . basename($path);

       is equivalent to the original path for all systems but VMS.

       "fileparse"
               my($filename, $dirs, $suffix) = fileparse($path);
               my($filename, $dirs, $suffix) = fileparse($path, @suffixes);
               my $filename                  = fileparse($path, @suffixes);

           The  fileparse()  routine divides a file path into its $dirs, $filename and (optionally) the filename
           $suffix.

           $dirs contains everything up to and including the last directory separator in the $path including the
           volume (if applicable).  The remainder of the $path is the $filename.

                # On Unix returns ("baz", "/foo/bar/", "")
                fileparse("/foo/bar/baz");

                # On Windows returns ("baz", 'C:\foo\bar\', "")
                fileparse('C:\foo\bar\baz');

                # On Unix returns ("", "/foo/bar/baz/", "")
                fileparse("/foo/bar/baz/");

           If @suffixes are given each element is a pattern (either a string or a "qr//")  matched  against  the
           end of the $filename.  The matching portion is removed and becomes the $suffix.

                # On Unix returns ("baz", "/foo/bar/", ".txt")
                fileparse("/foo/bar/baz.txt", qr/\.[^.]*/);

           If  type  is  non-Unix  (see  "fileparse_set_fstype") then the pattern matching for suffix removal is
           performed case-insensitively, since those systems are not case-sensitive when opening existing files.

           You are guaranteed that "$dirs . $filename . $suffix" will denote the same location as  the  original
           $path.

       "basename"
               my $filename = basename($path);
               my $filename = basename($path, @suffixes);

           This  function  is  provided  for compatibility with the Unix shell command <a href="../man1/basename.1.html">basename</a>(1).  It does <b>NOT</b>
           always return the file name portion of a path as you might expect.  To be safe, if you want the  file
           name portion of a path use fileparse().

           basename()  returns  the  last  level  of a filepath even if the last level is clearly directory.  In
           effect, it is acting like pop() for paths.  This differs from fileparse()'s behaviour.

               # Both return "bar"
               basename("/foo/bar");
               basename("/foo/bar/");

           @suffixes work as in fileparse() except all regex metacharacters are quoted.

               # These two function calls are equivalent.
               my $filename = basename("/foo/bar/baz.txt",  ".txt");
               my $filename = fileparse("/foo/bar/baz.txt", qr/\Q.txt\E/);

           Also note that in order to be compatible with the shell command, basename()  does  not  strip  off  a
           suffix if it is identical to the remaining characters in the filename.

       "dirname"
           This  function is provided for compatibility with the Unix shell command <a href="../man1/dirname.1.html">dirname</a>(1) and has inherited
           some of its quirks.  In spite of its name it does <b>NOT</b> always return the directory name as  you  might
           expect.  To be safe, if you want the directory name of a path use fileparse().

           Only  on  VMS  (where  there  is  no ambiguity between the file and directory portions of a path) and
           AmigaOS (possibly  due  to  an  implementation  quirk  in  this  module)  does  dirname()  work  like
           fileparse($path), returning just the $dirs.

               # On VMS and AmigaOS
               my $dirs = dirname($path);

           When using Unix or MSDOS syntax this emulates the <a href="../man1/dirname.1.html">dirname</a>(1) shell function which is subtly different
           from  how fileparse() works.  It returns all but the last level of a file path even if the last level
           is clearly a directory.  In effect, it is not returning the directory portion but simply the path one
           level up acting like chop() for file paths.

           Also unlike fileparse(), dirname() does not include a trailing slash on its returned path.

               # returns /foo/bar.  fileparse() would return /foo/bar/
               dirname("/foo/bar/baz");

               # also returns /foo/bar despite the fact that baz is clearly a
               # directory.  fileparse() would return /foo/bar/baz/
               dirname("/foo/bar/baz/");

               # returns '.'.  fileparse() would return 'foo/'
               dirname("foo/");

           Under VMS, if there is no directory information in the $path, then the  current  default  device  and
           directory is used.

       "fileparse_set_fstype"
             my $type = fileparse_set_fstype();
             my $previous_type = fileparse_set_fstype($type);

           Normally  File::Basename  will  assume  a file path type native to your current operating system (ie.
           /foo/bar style on Unix, \foo\bar on Windows, etc...).  With  this  function  you  can  override  that
           assumption.

           Valid  $types  are  "MacOS",  "VMS",  "AmigaOS",  "OS2", "RISCOS", "MSWin32", "DOS" (also "MSDOS" for
           backwards bug compatibility), "Epoc" and "Unix" (all case-insensitive).  If an unrecognized $type  is
           given "Unix" will be assumed.

           If  you've selected VMS syntax, and the file specification you pass to one of these routines contains
           a "/", they assume you are using Unix emulation and apply the Unix syntax  rules  instead,  for  that
           function call only.
