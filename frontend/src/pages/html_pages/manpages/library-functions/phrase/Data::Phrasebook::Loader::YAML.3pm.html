</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Data::Phrasebook::Loader::YAML - Absract your phrases with YAML.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Data::Phrasebook;

           my $q = Data::Phrasebook-&gt;new(
               class  =&gt; 'Fnerk',
               loader =&gt; 'YAML',
               file   =&gt; 'phrases.yaml',
           );

           $q-&gt;delimiters( qr{ \[% \s* (\w+) \s* %\] }x );
           my $phrase = $q-&gt;fetch($keyword);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class loader implements phrasebook patterns using YAML.

       Phrases can be contained within one or more dictionaries, with each phrase accessible via a unique key.
       Phrases may contain placeholders, please see Data::Phrasebook for an explanation of how to use these.
       Groups of phrases are kept in a dictionary. In this implementation a single file is one complete
       dictionary.

       An example YAML file:

         ---
         foo: &gt;
           Welcome to [% my %] world.
           It is a nice [%place %].

       Within the phrase text placeholders can be used, which are then replaced with the appropriate values once
       the <b>get()</b> method is called. The default style of placeholders can be altered using the <b>delimiters()</b>
       method.

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
       Data::Phrasebook::Loader::YAML inherits from the base class Data::Phrasebook::Loader::Base.  See that
       module for other available methods and documentation.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>load</b>
       Given a "file", load it. "file" must contain a YAML map.

          $loader-&gt;load( $file, @dict );

       This method is used internally by Data::Phrasebook::Generic's "data" method, to initialise the data
       store.

       It must take a "file" (be it a scalar, or something more complex) and return a handle. The "dict" is
       optional, should you wish to use the dictionary support.

   <b>get</b>
       Returns the phrase stored in the phrasebook, for a given keyword.

          my $value = $loader-&gt;get( $key );

       If one or more named dictionaries have been previously selected, they will be searched in order, followed
       by the default dictionary. The first hit on "key" will be returned, otherwise "undef" is returned.

   <b>dicts</b>
       Returns the list of dictionaries available.

          my @dicts = $loader-&gt;dicts();

       This is the list of all dictionaries available in the source file. If multiple dictionaries are not being
       used, then an empty list will be returned.

   <b>keywords</b>
       Returns the list of keywords available. List is lexically sorted.

        my @keywords = $loader-&gt;keywords( $dict );

       If one or more named dictionaries have been previously selected, they will be farmed for keywords,
       followed by the default dictionary.

       The "dict" argument is optional, and may be used to override the search to a single named dictionary, or
       a list of dictionaries if passed by reference, plus the default dictionary of course.

       To find all available keywords in all available dictionaries, use the following:

        $loader-&gt;keywords( [ $loader-&gt;dicts ] );

   <b>set_default</b>
       If a requested phrase is not found in the named dictionary an attempt is made to find it in the <u>default</u>
       dictionary. Data::Phrasebook loaders normally use the first dictionary in the phrasebook as the default,
       but as mentioned in "DICTIONARY SUPPORT" this does not make sense because the dictionaries in YAML
       phrasebooks are not ordered.

       To override the automatically selected default dictionary use this method, and pass it a
       "default_dictionary_name". This value is only reset at phrasebook load time, so you'll probably need to
       trigger a reload:

        $q-&gt;loader-&gt;set_default( $default_dictionary_name );
        $q-&gt;loader-&gt;load( $file );

       To reset the loader's behaviour to automatic default dictionary selection, pass this method an undefined
       value, and then reload.

</pre><h4><b>DICTIONARY</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       This loader supports the use of dictionaries, as well as multiple dictionaries with a search order. If
       you are unfamiliar with these features, see Data::Phrasebook for more information.

       Source data format for a single unnamed dictionary is a YAML stream that has as its <u>root</u> <u>node</u> an
       anonymous hash, like so:

        ---
        first_key: first_value
        second_key: second_value

       In this case, specifying one or more named dictionaries will have no effect.  The single dictionary that
       comprises the YAML file will take the place of your <u>default</u> dictionary, so will always be searched. To
       override this behaviour use the "set_default" object method.

       Multiple dictionaries <b>must</b> be specified using a two-level hash system, where the root node of your YAML
       file is an anonymous hash containing dictionary names, and the values of those hash keys are further
       anonymous hashes containing the dictionary contents. Here is an example:

        ---
        dict_one:
           first_key: first_value
           second_key: second_value
        dict_two:
           first_key: first_value
           second_key: second_value

       If you use any other structure for your YAML dictionary files, the result is uncertain, and this loader
       module is very likely to crash your program.

       If a requested phrase is not found in the named dictionary an attempt is made to find it in the <u>default</u>
       dictionary. Data::Phrasebook loaders normally use the first dictionary in the phrasebook as the default,
       but this does not make sense because YAML phrasebook files contain an unordered hash of dictionaries.

       This loader will therefore select the first dictionary from the list of <u>lexically</u> <u>sorted</u> dictionary names
       to be the default. To override this behaviour use the "set_default" object method. Alternatively, just
       include a dictionary that is guaranteed to be selected for the default (e.g.  "0000default"); it need not
       contain any keys.
