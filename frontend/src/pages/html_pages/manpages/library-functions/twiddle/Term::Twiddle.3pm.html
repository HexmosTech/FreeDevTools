       Term::Twiddle - Twiddles a thingy while-u-wait

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Term::Twiddle;
         my $spinner = new Term::Twiddle;

         $spinner-&gt;start;
         system('tar', '-xvf', 'some_phat_tarfile.tar');
         $spinner-&gt;stop;

         $spinner-&gt;random;  ## makes it appear to really struggle at times!
         $spinner-&gt;start;
         &amp;some_long_function();
         $spinner-&gt;stop;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Always fascinated by the spinner during FreeBSD's loader bootstrap, I wanted to capture it so I could
       view it any time I wanted to--and I wanted to make other people find that same joy I did. Now, anytime
       you or your users have to wait for something to finish, instead of twiddling their thumbs, they can watch
       the computer twiddle its thumbs.

   <b>During</b> <b>Twiddling</b>
       Once the twiddler/spinner is in motion you need to do something (e.g., unpack a tar file, call some long
       function, etc.). You can do almost anything in between <b>start</b> and <b>stop</b> as long as there are no <b>sleep</b> calls
       in there (unless the process has been forked, as in a Perl <b>system</b> call). From Time::HiRes:

           Use of interval timers may interfere with alarm(), sleep(), and
           usleep().  In standard-speak the "interaction is unspecified",
           which means that anything may happen: it may work, it may not.

       Try not to do any terminal I/O while the twiddler is going (unless you don't mind dragging the twiddler
       around with your cursor).

   <b>Spinner</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <b>new</b> Creates a new Twiddle object:

               my $spinner = new Term::Twiddle;

           Optionally initializes the Twiddle object:

               ## a moderately paced spinner
               my $spinner = new Term::Twiddle( { rate =&gt; 0.075 } );

       <b>start</b>
           Starts the twiddler twiddling:

               $spinner-&gt;start;

       <b>stop</b>
           Stops the twiddler:

               $spinner-&gt;stop;

       <b>thingy</b>
           Creates  a  new  thingy.  The  argument  is a reference to a list of strings to print (usually single
           characters) so that animation looks good. The default spinner sequence looks like this:

               $spinner-&gt;thingy( [ "\\", "|", "/", "-" ] );

           an arrow could be done like this:
               $spinner-&gt;thingy( [
                                  "----&gt;",
                                  " -----&gt;",
                                  "  -----&gt;",
                                  "   -----&gt;",
                                  "    -----&gt;|",
                                  "     ----&gt;|",
                                  "      ---&gt;|",
                                  "       --&gt;|",
                                  "        -&gt;|",
                                  "         &gt;|",
                                  "          |",
                                  "           "]);

           Look at the test.pl file for this package for more fun thingy ideas.

       <b>rate</b>
           Changes the rate at which the thingy is changing (e.g., spinner is spinning). This  is  the  time  to
           wait  between  thingy  characters  (or  "frames") in seconds. Fractions of seconds are supported. The
           default rate is 0.175 seconds.

               $spinner-&gt;rate(0.075);  ## faster!

       <b>probability</b>
           Determines how likely it is for each step in the thingy's motion to change rate of change.  That  is,
           each  time  the  thingy  advances  in  its  sequence,  a random number from 1 to 100 is generated. If
           <b>probability</b> is set, it is compared to the random number. If the probability is greater than or  equal
           to  the  randomly generated number, then a new rate of change is randomly computed (between 0 and 0.2
           seconds).

           In short, if you want the thingy to change rates often, set <b>probability</b> high. Otherwise set  it  low.
           If you don't want the rate to change ever, set it to 0 (zero). 0 is the default.

               ## half of all sequence changes will result in a new rate of change
               $spinner-&gt;<a href="../man50/probability.50.html">probability</a>(50);
               $spinner-&gt;start;
               do_something;
               $spinner-&gt;stop;

           The  purpose  of this is to create a random rate of change for the thingy, giving the impression that
           whatever the user is waiting for is certainly doing a lot of work  (e.g.,  as  the  rate  slows,  the
           computer is working harder, as the rate increases, the computer is working very fast. Either way your
           computer looks good!).

       <b>random</b>
           Invokes  the  <b>probability</b>  method with the argument specified. If no argument is specified, 25 is the
           default value. This is meant as a short-cut for the <b>probability</b> method.

               $spinner-&gt;random;

       <b>stream</b>
           Select an alternate stream to print on. By default, STDOUT is printed to.

               $spinner-&gt;stream(*STDERR);

   <b>Alternative</b> <b>Spinner</b> <b>Methods</b>
       Since version 2.70, <b>Term::Twiddle</b> objects support a couple of new spinners that aren't so  "plain".  2.70
       includes a <b>bounce</b>ing ball and a <b>swish</b>ing object (that's the best name I could think to call it).

       The following methods are used to activate and customize these new spinners.

       <b>type</b>
           Use  this method to set the type of spinner. The default type (no type) is whatever <b>thingy</b> is set to.
           Two other currently supported types are <b>bounce</b>, and <b>swish</b>. These may be set in the constructor:

               my $sp = new Term::Twiddle({ type =&gt; 'bounce' });
               $sp-&gt;start;

           or you can set it with this <b>type</b> method:

               my $sp = new Term::Twiddle;
               $sp-&gt;type('bounce');

           There is currently no way to add new <b>type</b>s without some hacking (it's on the "to do" list).

       <b>width</b>
           This method is only used when <b>type</b> is undefined (i.e., a normal spinner). <b>width</b> determines  how  wide
           the <b>bounce</b> or <b>swish</b> objects go. <b>width</b> may be set in the constructor:

               my $sp = new Term::Twiddle({ type =&gt; 'bounce', width =&gt; 60 });
               $sp-&gt;start;

           or you can set it with this <b>width</b> method:

               my $sp = new Term::Twiddle({ type =&gt; 'swish' });
               $sp-&gt;<a href="../man74/width.74.html">width</a>(74);

       <b>delay</b>
           Determines  the  speed  of motion of the object. Usually the default is fine (and each object has its
           own default delay option for optimal aesthetics).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Show the user something while we unpack the archive:

           my $sp = new Term::Twiddle;
           $sp-&gt;random;
           $sp-&gt;start;
           system('tar', '-zxf', '/some/tarfile.tar.gz');
           $sp-&gt;stop;

       Show the user a bouncing ball while we modify their configuration file:

           my $sp = new Term::Twiddle( { type =&gt; 'bounce' } );
           $sp-&gt;start;

           ## there must not be any 'sleep' calls in this!
           do_config_stuff();

           $sp-&gt;stop;

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       •   Prolly won't run  on  platforms  lacking  <b>setitimer</b>.  Will  run  on  Cygwin/Win32  (reported  by  Zak
           Zebrowski--thanks!).

       •

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       •   Thanks  to  Tom  Christiansen for the timer code (found lurking in an old FAQ somewhere). He probably
           never had an idea that it would be part of one of the most useful modules on CPAN ;o)

           The timer code has since been replaced by <b>Time::HiRes</b>'s <b>setitimer</b> function, but it is good  to  thank
           Mr. Christiansen for his goodness to Perl anyway.

       •   "Drew"  (<a href="mailto:drew@drewtaylor.com">drew@drewtaylor.com</a>)  from  rt.cpan.org for suggesting the removal of 'use warnings' for the
           faithful 5.005 users.

       •   Orignal   swishing   motion   filched   from   <b>Term::ReadKey</b>'s   test.pl   by   Kenneth    Albanowski
           (<a href="mailto:kjahds@kjahds.com">kjahds@kjahds.com</a>). Danke!
