</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Graphics::Primitive - Device and library agnostic graphic primitives

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Graphics::Primitive is a device and library agnostic system for creating and manipulating various
       graphical elements such as Borders, Fonts, Paths and the like.

           my $c = Graphics::Primitive::Component-&gt;new(
             background_color =&gt; Graphics::Color::RGB-&gt;new(
                 red =&gt; 1, green =&gt; 0, blue =&gt; 0
             ),
             width =&gt; 500, height =&gt; 350,
             border =&gt; new Graphics::Primitive::Border-&gt;new( width =&gt; 5 )
           );

           my $driver = Graphics::Primitive::Driver::Cairo-&gt;new(format =&gt; 'SVG');

           $driver-&gt;prepare($c);
           $driver-&gt;finalize($c);
           $driver-&gt;draw($c);

           $driver-&gt;write($filename)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Graphics::Primitive is library agnostic system for drawing things.

       The idea is to allow you to create and manipulate graphical components and then pass them off to a Driver
       for actual drawing.

</pre><h4><b>CONCEPTS</b></h4><pre>
       The root object for Graphics::Primitive is the Component.  Components contain all the common elements
       that you'd expect: margins, padding, background color etc.

       The next most important is the Container.  Containers are Components that can hold other Components.
       Containers have all the attributes and methods of a Component with the addition of the <u>layout_manager</u>
       attribute for us with Layout::Manager.

       Another important Component is the Canvas.  The Canvas differs from other components by being a container
       for various Geometry::Primitive objects.  This allows drawing of arbitrary shapes that do not fit
       existing components.

</pre><h4><b>DRAWING</b> <b>LIFECYCLE</b></h4><pre>
       After creating all your components, there is a lifecycle that allows them to do their internal
       housekeeping to prepare for eventual drawing.  The lifecycle is: <b>prepare</b>, <b>layout</b> and <b>pack</b>.  Detailed
       explanation of these methods can be found in Component.

</pre><h4><b>PREPARATION</b></h4><pre>
       Graphics::Primitive::Component has a "prepared" flag.  This flag is set as part of the "prepare" method
       (shocking, I know).  If this flag is set, then subsequent calls to "prepare" are ignored.  Containers
       also have a prepare flag, but this flag is <b>not</b> set when calling "prepare".  A Container's flag should be
       set by the layout manager.  More information may be found with Layout::Manager.

</pre><h4><b>INSPIRATION</b></h4><pre>
       Most of the concepts that you'll find in Graphics::Primitive are inspired by Cairo
       &lt;<a href="http://cairographics.org">http://cairographics.org</a>&gt;'s API and CSS &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/</a>&gt;'s box model.
