</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Graphics::Primitive::Component - Base graphical unit

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A Component is an entity with a graphical representation.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $c = Graphics::Primitive::Component-&gt;new({
           origin =&gt; Geometry::Primitive::Point-&gt;new({
               x =&gt; $x, y =&gt; $y
           }),
           width =&gt; 500, height =&gt; 350
         });

</pre><h4><b>LIFECYCLE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>prepare</b>
           Most  components  do the majority of their setup in the <b>prepare</b>.  The goal of prepare is to establish
           it's minimum height and width so that it can be properly positioned by a layout manager.

             $driver-&gt;prepare($comp);

       <b>layout</b>
           This is not a method of Component, but a phase introduced by the  use  of  Layout::Manager.   If  the
           component  is a container then each of it's child components (even the containers) will be positioned
           according to the minimum height and  width  determined  during  <b>prepare</b>.   Different  layout  manager
           implementations  have different rules, so consult the documentation for each for details.  After this
           phase has completed the origin, height and width should be set for all components.

             $lm-&gt;do_layout($comp);

       <b>finalize</b>
           This final phase provides and opportunity for the component to do any final changes to it's internals
           before being passed to a driver for drawing.  An example might be a component that draws a fleuron at
           it's extremities.  Since the final height and width isn't known until this phase, it  was  impossible
           for  it  to  position  these  internal  components  until  now.   It  may even defer creation of this
           components until now.

           <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>ok</b> <b>to</b> <b>defer</b> <b>all</b> <b>action</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finalize</b> <b>phase.</b>  <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>hieght</b> <b>and</b>
           <b>width</b> <b>during</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>layout</b> <b>manager</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>enough</b> <b>space</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw.</b>

               $driver-&gt;finalize($comp);

       <b>draw</b>
           Handled by Graphics::Primitive::Driver.

              $driver-&gt;draw($comp);

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructor</b>
       <u>new</u> Creates a new Component.

   <b>Instance</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <u>background_color</u>
           Set this component's background color.

       <u>border</u>
           Set this component's border, which should be an instance of Border.

       <u>callback</u>
           Optional callback that is fired at the beginning of the "finalize" phase.  This  allows  you  to  add
           some sort of custom code that can modify the component just before it is rendered.  The only argument
           is the component itself.

           Note that changing the position or the dimensions of the component will <b>not</b> re-layout the scene.  You
           may have weird results of you manipulate the component's dimensions here.

       <u>class</u>
           Set/Get this component's class, which is an abitrary string.  Graphics::Primitive has no internal use
           for this attribute but provides it for outside use.

       <u>color</u>
           Set this component's foreground color.

       <u>fire_callback</u>
           Method to execute this component's "callback".

       <u>get_tree</u>
           Get  a  tree  for this component.  Since components are -- by definiton -- leaf nodes, this tree will
           only have the one member at it's root.

       <u>has_callback</u>
           Predicate that tells if this component has a "callback".

       <u>height</u>
           Set this component's height.

       <u>inside_bounding_box</u>
           Returns a Rectangle that defines the edges of the 'inside' box  for  this  component.   This  box  is
           relative to the origin of the component.

       <u>inside_height</u>
           Get the height available in this container after taking away space for padding, margin and borders.

       <u>inside_width</u>
           Get the width available in this container after taking away space for padding, margin and borders.

       <u>margins</u>
           Set  this  component's margins, which should be an instance of Insets.  Margins are the space <u>outside</u>
           the component's bounding box, as in CSS.  The margins should be outside the border.

       <u>maximum_height</u>
           Set/Get this component's maximum height.  Used to inform a layout manager.

       <u>maximum_width</u>
           Set/Get this component's maximum width.  Used to inform a layout manager.

       <u>minimum_height</u>
           Set/Get this component's minimum height.  Used to inform a layout manager.

       <u>minimum_inside_height</u>
           Get the minimum height available in this container after taking away space for  padding,  margin  and
           borders.

       <u>minimum_inside_width</u>
           Get  the  minimum  width  available in this container after taking away space for padding, margin and
           borders.

       <u>minimum_width</u>
           Set/Get this component's minimum width.  Used to inform a layout manager.

       <u>name</u>
           Set this component's name.  This is not required, but may  inform  consumers  of  a  component.   Pay
           attention to that library's documentation.

       <u>origin</u>
           Set/Get the origin point for this component.

       <u>outside_height</u>
           Get the height consumed by padding, margin and borders.

       <u>outside_width</u>
           Get the width consumed by padding, margin and borders.

       <u>finalize</u>
           Method  provided to give component one last opportunity to put it's contents into the provided space.
           Called after prepare.

       <u>padding</u>
           Set this component's padding, which should be an instance of Insets.  Padding is the space <u>inside</u> the
           component's bounding box, as in CSS.  This padding should be between the border and  the  component's
           content.

       <u>page</u>
           If true then this component represents stand-alone page.  This informs the driver that this component
           (and any children) are to be renderered on a single surface.  This only really makes sense in formats
           that have pages such as PDF of PostScript.

       <u>prepare</u>
           Method  to prepare this component for drawing.  This is an empty sub and is meant to be overridden by
           a specific implementation.

       <u>preferred_height</u>
           Set/Get this component's preferred height.  Used to inform a layout manager.

       <u>preferred_width</u>
           Set/Get this component's preferred width.  Used to inform a layout manager.

       <u>to_string</u>
           Get a string representation of this component in the form of:

             $name $x,$y ($widthx$height)

       <u>visible</u>
           Set/Get this component's visible flag.

       <u>width</u>
           Set/Get this component's width.
