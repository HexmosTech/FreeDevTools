       Graphics::Primitive::Canvas - Component composed of paths

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Graphics::Primitive::Canvas is a component for drawing arbitrary things.  It holds Paths and Operations.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Graphics::Primitive::Canvas;

         my $canvas = Graphics::Primitive::Canvas-&gt;new;
         $canvas-&gt;move_to($point); # or just $x, $y
         $canvas-&gt;do($op);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Canvas is a container for multiple Paths.  It has a <u>path</u> that is the operative path for all path-
       related methods.  You can treat the Canvas as if it was a path, calling methods like <u>line_to</u> or <u>move_to</u>.

       When you are ready to perform an operation on the path, call the <u>do</u> method with the operation you want to
       call as an argument.  Drawing a line and stroking it would look like:

         $canvas-&gt;move_to(0, 0);
         $canvas-&gt;line_to(10, 10);
         my $op = Graphics::Primitive::Operation::Stroke-&gt;new;
         $stroke-&gt;brush-&gt;color(
             Graphics::Color::RGB-&gt;new(red =&gt; 0, blue =&gt; 1, green =&gt; 1)
         );
         $canvas-&gt;do($op);

       When you instantiate a Canvas a newly instantiated path resides in <u>path</u>.  After you call <u>do</u> that current
       path is moved to the <u>paths</u> list and new path is placed in <u>current_path</u>.  If you want to keep the path
       around you can call <u>save</u> before <u>do</u> then call <u>restore</u> to put a saved copy of the path back into <u>path</u>.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructor</b>
       <u>new</u> Creates a new Graphics::Primitive::Canvas

   <b>Instance</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <u>do</u>  Given an operation, pushes the current path onto the path stack.

             FIXME: Example

       <u>path</u>
           The current path this canvas is using.

       <u>path_count</u>
           Count of paths in <u>paths</u>.

       <u>paths</u>
           Arrayref of hashrefs representing paths combined with their operations:

             [
               {
                   path =&gt; $path,
                   op   =&gt; $op
               },
             ]

       <u>restore</u>
           Replace the current path by popping the top path from the saved path list.

       <u>save</u>
           Copy the current path and push it onto the stack of saved paths.

       <u>saved_paths</u>
           List of saved paths.  Add to the list with <u>save</u> and pop from it using <u>restore</u>.

       <u>saved_path_count</u>
           Count of paths saved in <u>saved_paths</u>.
