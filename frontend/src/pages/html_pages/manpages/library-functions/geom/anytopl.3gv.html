       AnyToPL - convert an arbitrary geom to a polylist (OFF file format)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include "geomutil.h"

       Geom *AnyToPL(Geom *, Transform);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       AnyToPL()  takes  any  geom  as  an  arguement.  It then returns a polylist object which is geometrically
       identical to the original geom.  The transform argument is the transform applied to the entire object; it
       should generally be set to TM_IDENTITY when AnyToPL() is first called.  Geometric objects are handled  in
       the following ways:

       Polylists:  A transformed copy of the original is returned.

       Bezier:  The object is rediced if necessary, then handled as a mesh object.

       Quad:  The object is directly transformed into a new polylist.

       Mesh:   The  object  is  directly  transformed  into  a new polylist, with extra polygons added to do the
       wrapping if necessary.

       Vect:  The object is converted into a polylist containing a 2-gon  for  every  segment  in  the  original
       vector  object.   The  colors  of  the  faces are the same as the colors of the original object, but this
       generally is irrelevant since the faces are not visible.  Note that edge visibility must be  enabled  for
       an object which has been converted from a vect to a polylist to be visible in geomview.

       List:   AnyToPL()  is  called  recursively  and  the resultant polylists are combined using <a href="../man3/PLCombine.3.html">PLCombine</a>(3).
       Inst:  AnyToPL() is called recursively with a new transformation matrix.   The  resultant  polylists  are
       combined using <a href="../man3/PLCombine.3.html">PLCombine</a>(3).

       No  effort  is  made to eliminate identical vertices.  However, no extraneous repeated vertexes should be
       created.  The resultant polylist should have the same number of vertexes as the original object.

</pre><h4><b>LINKING</b></h4><pre>
       AnyToPL() is part of the geomutil library; see <a href="../man3/geomutil.3.html">geomutil</a>(3) for information on how to  link  your  program
       with this library.
