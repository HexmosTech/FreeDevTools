       DBE - Double Buffer Extension

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The  Double  Buffer  Extension  (DBE)  provides  a  standard  way  to utilize double-buffering within the
       framework of the X Window System.  Double-buffering uses two buffers, called front and back,  which  hold
       images.   The  front  buffer  is  visible  to  the user; the back buffer is not.  Successive frames of an
       animation are rendered into the back buffer while the previously rendered frame is displayed in the front
       buffer.  When a new frame is ready, the back and front buffers swap roles, making the new frame  visible.
       Ideally,  this  exchange  appears to happen instantaneously to the user, with no visual artifacts.  Thus,
       only completely rendered images are presented to the user, and remain visible during the entire  time  it
       takes to render a new frame.  The result is a flicker-free animation.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Concepts</b>
              Normal windows are created using <b>XCreateWindow()</b> or <b>XCreateSimpleWindow(),</b> which allocate a set of
              window  attributes and, for InputOutput windows, a front buffer, into which an image can be drawn.
              The contents of this buffer will be displayed when the window is visible.

              This extension enables applications to use double-buffering with a window.  This involves creating
              a second buffer, called a back buffer, and associating one or more back buffer names  <u>(XIDs)</u>  with
              the window, for use when referring to (i.e., drawing to or reading from) the window's back buffer.
              The back buffer name is a drawable of type <u>XdbeBackBuffer.</u>

              DBE  provides  a relative double-buffering model.  One XID, the window, always refers to the front
              buffer.  One or more other XIDs, the back buffer names, always refer to the back buffer.  After  a
              buffer  swap,  the  window  continues to refer to the (new) front buffer, and the back buffer name
              continues to refer to the (new) back buffer.  Thus, applications and toolkits that  want  to  just
              render  to the back buffer always use the back buffer name for all drawing requests to the window.
              Portions of an application that want to render to the front buffer always use the window  XID  for
              all drawing requests to the window.

              Multiple  clients  and  toolkits  can  all  use double-buffering on the same window.  DBE does not
              provide a request for querying whether a window has double-buffering support, and if so, what  the
              back  buffer name is.  Given the asynchronous nature of the X Window System, this would cause race
              conditions.  Instead, DBE allows multiple back buffer names to exist for the same window; they all
              refer to the same physical back buffer.  The first time a back buffer  name  is  allocated  for  a
              window, the window becomes double-buffered and the back buffer name is associated with the window.
              Subsequently, the window already is a double-buffered window, and nothing about the window changes
              when  a new back buffer name is allocated, except that the new back buffer name is associated with
              the window.  The window remains double-buffered until either the window is destroyed, or until all
              of the back buffer names for the window are deallocated.

              In general, both the front and back buffers ae treated the same.  In  particular,  here  are  some
              important characteristics:

                     Only one buffer per window can be visible at a time (the front buffer).

                     Both  buffers associated with a window have the same visual type, depth, width, height, and
                     shape as the window.

                     Both buffers associated with a window are "visible" (or "obscured") in the same way.   When
                     an  Expose  event  is  generated  for  a  window, this event is considered to apply to both
                     buffers equally.  When a double-buffered window is exposed, both buffers are tiled with the
                     window background.  Even though the back buffer is not visible, terms such as obscure apply
                     to the back buffer as well as to the front buffer.

                     It is acceptable at any time to pass an <u>XdbeBackBuffer</u>  in  any  function  that  expects  a
                     drawable.   This  enables  an  application to draw directly into <u>XdbeBackBuffer</u> in the same
                     fashion as it would draw into any other drawable.

                     It is an error (Window) to pass an <u>XdbeBackBuffer</u> in a function that expects a Window.

                     An <u>XdbeBackBuffer</u> will never be sent in  a  reply,  event,  or  error  where  a  Window  is
                     specified.

                     If  backing-store  and  save-under  applies to a double-buffered window, it applies to both
                     buffers equally.

                     If the <b>XClearArea()</b> or <b>XClearWindow()</b> function is executed on a double-buffered window, the
                     same area in both the front and back buffers is cleared.

              The effect of passing a window to a  function  that  accepts  a  drawable  is  unchanged  by  this
              extension.  The window and front buffer are synonymous with each other.  This includes obeying the
              <b>XGetImage()</b> and <b>XGetSubImage()</b> semantics and the subwindow-mode semantics if a graphics context is
              involved.   Regardless  of  whether  the  window  was  explicitly  passed  in  an  <b>XGetImage()</b>  or
              <b>XGetSubImage()</b> call, or implicitly referenced (i.e., one of the window's ancestors was  passed  in
              the  function), the front (i.e. visible) buffer is always referenced.  Thus, DBE-naive screen dump
              clients will always get the front buffer.  <b>XGetImage()</b> and <b>XGetSubImage()</b> on a back buffer  return
              undefined image contents for any obscured regions of the back buffer that fall within the image.

              Drawing  to  a  back  buffer  always  uses the clip region that would be used to draw to the front
              buffer with a GC subwindow-mode of ClipByChildren.  If an ancestor of a double-buffered window  is
              drawn  to with a GC having a subwindow-mode of IncludeInferiors, the effect on the double-buffered
              window's back buffer depends on the depth of the double-buffered window and the ancestor.  If  the
              depths  are  the  same,  the  contents  of  the  back buffer of the double-buffered window are not
              changed.  If the depths are different, the contents of the  back  buffer  of  the  double-buffered
              window are undefined for the pixels that the IncludeInferiors drawing touched.

              DBE  adds  no  new  events.   DBE  does  not  extend the semantics of any existing events with the
              exception of adding a new drawable type called <u>XdbeBackBuffer.</u>

              If events, replies, or errors that contain a drawable  (e.g.,  GraphicsExpose)  are  generated  in
              response to a request, the drawable returned will be the one specified in the request.

              DBE advertises which visuals support double buffering.

              DBE  does  not  include  any  timing  or  synchronization facilities.  Applications that need such
              facilities (e.g., to maintain a  constant  frame  rate)  should  investigate  the  Synchronization
              Extension, an X Consortium standard.

       <b>Window</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Operations</b>

              The  basic  philosophy  of  DBE  is  that both buffers are treated the same by X window management
              operations.

              When a double-buffered window is destroyed, both buffers associated with the window are destroyed,
              and all back buffer names associated with the window are freed.

              If the size of a double-buffered window changes,  both  buffers  assume  the  new  size.   If  the
              window's  size  increases,  the effect on the buffers depends on whether the implementation honors
              bit gravity for buffers.  If bit gravity is implemented, then the contents  of  both  buffers  are
              moved  in  accordance  with  the  window's bit gravity, and the remaining areas are tiled with the
              window background.  If bit gravity is not implemented, then the entire unobscured region  of  both
              buffers  is tiled with the window background.  In either case, Expose events are generated for the
              region that is tiled with the window background.

              If the <b>XGetGeometry()</b> function is executed on an <u>XdbeBackBuffer,</u> the returned x,  y,  and  border-
              width will be zero.

              If  the  Shape  extension  <b>ShapeRectangles,</b>  <b>ShapeMask,</b>  <b>ShapeCombine,</b>  or  <b>ShapeOffset</b> request is
              executed on a double-buffered window, both buffers are reshaped to match  the  new  window  shape.
              The  region  difference  D  =  new  shape  - old shape is tiled with the window background in both
              buffers, and Expose events are generated for D.

       <b>Complex</b> <b>Swap</b> <b>Actions</b>

              DBE has no explicit knowledge of ancillary buffers (e.g. depth buffers or alpha buffers), and only
              has a limited set of defined swap actions.  Some applications  may  need  a  richer  set  of  swap
              actions  than  DBE provides.  Some DBE implementations have knowledge of ancillary buffers, and/or
              can provide a rich set of swap actions. Instead of continually extending DBE to increase  its  set
              of  swap actions, DBE provides a flexible "idiom" mechanism.  If an application's needs are served
              by the defined swap actions, it should use them; otherwise, it should use the following method  of
              expressing a complex swap action as an idiom.  Following this policy will ensure the best possible
              performance across a wide variety of implementations.

              As  suggested  by the term "idiom," a complex swap action should be expressed as a group/series of
              requests.  Taken together, this group of requests may be combined into an atomic operation by  the
              implementation,  in  order  to  maximize  performance.   The set of idioms actually recognized for
              optimization is implementation dependent.  To help with idiom expression  and  interpretation,  an
              idiom  must be surrounded by two function calls: <b>XdbeBeginIdiom()</b> and <b>XdbeEndIdiom().</b>  Unless this
              begin-end pair surrounds the idiom, it may not  be  recognized  by  a  given  implementation,  and
              performance will suffer.

              For  example,  if  an  application  wants to swap buffers for two windows, and use X to clear only
              certain planes of the back buffers, the application would make the following calls as a group, and
              in the following order:

                     <b>XdbeBeginIdiom().</b>

                     <b>XdbeSwapBuffers()</b> with XIDs for two windows, each of which uses a swap action of Untouched.

                     <b>XFillRectangle()</b> to the back buffer of one window.

                     <b>XFillRectangle()</b> to the back buffer of the other window.

                     <b>XdbeEndIdiom().</b>

              The <b>XdbeBeginIdiom()</b> and <b>XdbeEndIdiom()</b> functions do not perform any actions themselves.  They are
              treated as markers by implementations that  can  combine  certain  groups/series  of  requests  as
              idioms,  and are ignored by other implementations or for non-recognized groups/series of requests.
              If these function calls are made out of order, or are mismatched, no  errors  are  sent,  and  the
              functions are executed as usual, though performance may suffer.

              <b>XdbeSwapBuffers()</b>  need  not  be included in an idiom.  For example, if a swap action of Copied is
              desired, but only some of the planes  should  be  copied,  <b>XCopyArea()</b>  may  be  used  instead  of
              <b>XdbeSwapBuffers().</b>  If <b>XdbeSwapBuffers()</b> is included in an idiom, it should immediately follow the
              <b>XdbeBeginIdiom()</b>  call.   Also, when the <b>XdbeSwapBuffers()</b> is included in an idiom, that request's
              swap action will still be valid, and if the swap action might overlap with another  request,  then
              the  final  result  of  the idiom must be as if the separate requests were executed serially.  For
              example, if the specified swap action is Untouched, and if a <b>XFillRectangle()</b> using a client  clip
              rectangle  is done to the window's back buffer after the <b>XdbeSwapBuffers()</b> call, then the contents
              of the new back buffer (after the idiom) will be the same as if the idiom was  not  recognized  by
              the implementation.

              It  is highly recommended that API providers define, and application developers use, "convenience"
              functions that allow client applications to call one procedure that  encapsulates  common  idioms.
              These  functions  will  generate  the <b>XdbeBeginIdiom(),</b> idiom, and <b>XdbeEndIdiom()</b> calls.  Usage of
              these functions will ensure best possible performance across a wide variety of implementations.
