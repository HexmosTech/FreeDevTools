       clCreateFromD3D10BufferKHR - Creates an OpenCL buffer object from a Direct3D 10 buffer.

       <b>cl_mem</b> <b>clCreateFromD3D10BufferKHR(cl_context</b> <u>context</u><b>,</b> <b>cl_mem_flags</b> <u>flags</u><b>,</b> <b>ID3D10Buffer</b> <b>*</b><u>resource</u><b>,</b>
                                         <b>cl_int</b> <b>*</b><u>errcode_ret</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>context</u>
           A valid OpenCL context created from a Direct3D 10 device.

       <u>flags</u>
           A bit-field that is used to specify usage information. May be <b>CL_MEM_READ_ONLY</b>, <b>CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY</b>, or
           <b>CL_MEM_READ_WRITE</b>. (See the table for <b><a href="../man3clc/clCreateBuffer.3clc.html">clCreateBuffer</a></b>(3clc) for more information.)

       <u>resource</u>
           A pointer to the Direct3D 10 buffer to share.

       <u>errcode_ret</u>
           An appropriate error code. If <u>errcode_ret</u> is NULL, no error code is returned.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The size of the returned OpenCL buffer object is the same as the size of <u>resource</u>. This call will
       increment the internal Direct3D reference count on <u>resource</u>. The internal Direct3D reference count on
       <u>resource</u> will be decremented when the OpenCL reference count on the returned OpenCL memory object drops
       to zero.

       General information about sharing memory objects with Direct3D 10 follows.

       The goal of this extension is to provide interoperability between OpenCL and Direct3D 10. This is
       designed to function analogously to the OpenGL interoperability. If this extension is supported by an
       implementation, the string "cl_khr_d3d10_sharing" will be present in the <b>CL_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS</b> or
       <b>CL_DEVICE_EXTENSIONS</b> string described in the table of allowed values for <u>param_name</u> for
       <b><a href="../man3clc/clGetDeviceInfo.3clc.html">clGetDeviceInfo</a></b>(3clc).

       As currently proposed, the interfaces for this extension would be provided in cl_d3d10.h.

       This section discusses OpenCL functions that allow applications to use Direct3D 10 resources as OpenCL
       memory objects. This allows efficient sharing of data between OpenCL and Direct3D 10. The OpenCL API may
       be used to execute kernels that read and/or write memory objects that are also Direct3D 10 resources. An
       OpenCL image object may be created from a Direct3D 10 texture resource. An OpenCL buffer object may be
       created from a Direct3D 10 buffer resource. OpenCL memory objects may be created from Direct3D 10 objects
       if and only if the OpenCL context has been created from a Direct3D 10 device.  Lifetime of Shared
       Objects.PP An OpenCL memory object created from a Direct3D 10 resource remains valid as long as the
       corresponding Direct3D 10 resource has not been deleted. If the Direct3D 10 resource is deleted through
       the Direct3D 10 API, subsequent use of the OpenCL memory object will result in undefined behavior,
       including but not limited to possible OpenCL errors, data corruption, and program termination.

       The successful creation of a cl_context against a Direct3D 10 device specified via the context create
       parameter <b>CL_CONTEXT_D3D10_DEVICE_KHR</b> will increment the internal Direct3D reference count on the
       specified Direct3D 10 device. The internal Direct3D reference count on that Direct3D 10 device will be
       decremented when the OpenCL reference count on the returned OpenCL context drops to zero.

       The OpenCL context and corresponding command-queues are dependent on the existence of the Direct3D 10
       device from which the OpenCL context was created. If the Direct3D 10 device is deleted through the
       Direct3D 10 API, subsequent use of the OpenCL context will result in undefined behavior, including but
       not limited to possible OpenCL errors, data corruption, and program termination.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Returns CL_SUCCESS returns a valid non-zero OpenCL buffer object and <u>errcode_ret</u> is set to CL_SUCCESS if
       the buffer object is created successfully. Otherwise, it returns a NULL value with one of the following
       error values returned in <u>errcode_ret</u>:

       •   CL_INVALID_CONTEXT if <u>context</u> is not a valid context.

       •   CL_INVALID_VALUE if values specified in <u>flags</u> are not valid.

       •   CL_INVALID_D3D10_RESOURCE_KHR if <u>resource</u> is not a Direct3D 10 buffer resource, if <u>resource</u> was
           created with the <b>D3D10_USAGE</b> flag <b>D3D10_USAGE_IMMUTABLE</b>, if a <b>cl_mem</b> from resource has already been
           created using <b>clCreateFromD3D10BufferKHR</b>, or if <u>context</u> was not created against the same Direct3D 10
           device from which <u>resource</u> was created.

       •   CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL
           implementation on the host.
