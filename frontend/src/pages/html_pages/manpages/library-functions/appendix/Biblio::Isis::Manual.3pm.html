</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CDS/ISIS manual appendix F, G and H

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is partial scan of CDS/ISIS manual (appendix F, G and H, pages 257-272) which is than converted to
       text using OCR and proofread.  However, there might be mistakes, and any corrections sent to
       "<a href="mailto:dpavlin@rot13.org">dpavlin@rot13.org</a>" will be greatly appreciated.

       This digital version is made because current version available in ditial form doesn't contain details
       about CDS/ISIS file format and was essential in making Biblio::Isis module.

       This extract of manual has been produced in compliance with section (d) of WinIsis LICENCE for receiving
       institution/person which say:

        The receiving institution/person may:

        (d) Print/reproduce the CDS/ISIS manuals or portions thereof,
            provided that such copies reproduce the copyright notice;

</pre><h4><b>CDS/ISIS</b> <b>Files</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes the various files of the CDS/ISIS system, the file naming conventions and the file
       extensions used for each type of file. All CDS/ISIS files have standard names as follows:

         nnnnnn.eee

       where:

       "nnnnnn"  is  the  file  name  (all  file  names,  except  program  names,  are limited to a maximum of 6
                 characters)

       ".eee"    is the file extension identifying a particular type of file.

       Files marked with "*" are ASCII files which you may display or print. The other files are binary files.

   <b>A.</b> <b>System</b> <b>files</b>
       System files are common to all CDS/ISIS users and include the various  executable  programs  as  well  as
       system  menus,  worksheets  and message files provided by Unesco as well as additional ones which you may
       create.

       <u>CDS/ISIS</u> <u>Program</u>

       The name of the program file, as supplied by Unesco is

         ISIS.EXE

       Depending on the release and/or target computer, there may also be one or more overlay files.  These,  if
       present,  have  the  extension "OVL".  Check the contents of your system diskettes or tape to see whether
       overlay files are present.

       <u>System</u> <u>menus</u> <u>and</u> <u>worksheets</u>

       All system menus and worksheets have the file extension FMT and the names are built as follows:

         pctnnn.FMT

       where:

       "p"       is the page number (A for the first page, B for the second, etc.)

       "c"       is the language code (e.g. E for English), which must be one  of  those  provided  for  in  the
                 language selection menu xXLNG.

       "t"       is X for menus and Y for system worksheets

       "nnn"     is a unique identifier

       For example the full name of the English version of the menu xXGEN is "AEXGEN.FMT".

       The  page  number  is  transparent  to  the  CDS/ISIS  user.  Like  the file extension the page number is
       automatically provided by the system.  Therefore when a CDS/ISIS program prompts you to enter a  menu  or
       worksheet  name  you  must  not  include  the  page number. Furthermore as file names are restricted to 6
       characters, menus and worksheets names may not be longer than 5 characters.

       System menus and worksheets may only have one page.

       The language code is mandatory for system menus and standard system worksheets. For example if  you  want
       to link a HELP menu to the system menu EXGEN, its name must begin with the letter E.

       The  <b>X</b>  convention is only enforced for standard system menus. It is a good practice, however, to use the
       same convention for menus that you create,  and  to  avoid  creating  worksheets  (including  data  entry
       worksheets) with X in this position, that is with names like x<b>X</b>xxx.

       Furthermore,  if  a  data  base  name contains <b>X</b> or <b>Y</b> in the second position, then the corresponding data
       entry worksheets will be created in the system worksheet directory (parameter 2 of  "SYSPAR.PAR")  rather
       then the data base directory. Although this will not prevent normal operation of the data base, it is not
       recommended.

       <u>System</u> <u>messages</u> <u>files</u>

       System  messages  and  prompts  are  stored in standard CDS/ISIS data bases.  All corresponding data base
       files (see below) are required when updating a message file, but only the Master file is used to  display
       messages.

       There must be a message data base for each language supported through the language selection menu xXLNG.

       The data base name assigned to message data bases is xMSG (where x is the language code).

       <u>System</u> <u>tables</u>

       System tables are used by CDS/ISIS to define character sets. Two are required at present:

       "ISISUC.TAB"*
           defines lower to upper-case translation

       "ISISAC.TAB"*
           defines the alphabetic characters.

       <u>System</u> <u>print</u> <u>and</u> <u>work</u> <u>files</u>

       Certain  CDS/ISIS  print  functions do not send the output directly to the printer but store it on a disk
       file from which you may then print it at a convenient time. These files have all the file extension "LST"
       and are reused each time the corresponding function is executed.

       In addition CDS/ISIS creates temporary work files which are normally automatically discarded at  the  end
       of  the  session.  If  the  session  terminates  abnormally, however, they will not be deleted. A case of
       abnormal termination would be a power failure while you are using a CDS/ISIS program. Also  these  files,
       however,  are  reused each time, so that you do not normally need to delete them manually. Work files all
       have the extension "TMP".

       The print and work files created by CDS/ISIS are given below:

       "IFLIST.LST"*
           Inverted file listing file (produced by ISISINV)

       "WSLIST.LST"*
           Worksheet/menu listing file (produced by ISISUTL)

           System messages listing file (produced by ISISUTL)

       "x.LST"*
           Printed output (produced by ISISPRT when printing no print file name is supplied)

       "SORTIO.TMP"
           Sort work file 1

       "SORTII.TMP"
           Sort work file 2

       "SORTI2.TMP"

           Sort work file 7

       "SORT23.TMP"
           Sort work file 8

       "TRACE.TMP"*
           Trace file created by certain programs

       "ATSF.TMP"
           Temporary storage for hit lists created during retrieval

       "ATSQ.TMP"
           Temporary storage for search expressions

   <b>B.</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Base</b> <b>files</b>
       1.  mandatory files, which must always be present.  These are normally established when the data base  is
           defined by means of the ISISDEF services and should never be deleted;

       2.  auxiliary  files  created  by  the  system  whenever  certain  functions  are  performed.   These can
           periodically be deleted when they are no longer needed.

       3.  user files created by the data base user (such as display formats), which are fully under the  user's
           responsibility.

       Each  data  base  consists  of  a number of physically distinct files as indicated below. There are three
       categories of data base files:

       In the following description "xxxxxx" is the 1-6 character data base name.

       <u>Mandatory</u> <u>data</u> <u>base</u> <u>files</u>

       "xxxxxx.FDT"*
           Field Definition Table

       "xxxxxx.FST"*
           Field Select Table for Inverted file

       "xxxxxx.FMT"*
           Default data entry worksheet (where p is the page number).

           Note that the data base name is truncated to 5 characters if necessary

       "xxxxxx.PFT"*
           Default display format

       "xxxxxx.MST"
           Master file

       "xxxxxx.XRF"
           Crossreference file (Master file index)

           B*tree Nodes (for terms up to 10 characters long)

       "xxxxxx.L01"
           B*tree Leafs (for terms up to 10 characters long)

       "xxxxxx.N02"
           B*tree Nodes (for terms longer than 10 characters)

       "xxxxxx.L02"
           B*tree Leafs (for terms longer than 10 characters)

       "xxxxxx.IFP"
           Inverted file postings

       "xxxxxx.ANY"*
           ANY file

       <u>Auxiliary</u> <u>files</u>

       "xxxxxx.HIT"
           Hit file

       "xxxxxx.SRT"*
           Sort conversion table (see "Uppercase conversion table (1SISUC.TAB)" on page 227)

       "yyyyyy.STW"*
           Additional stopword files

       "yyyyyy.SAV"
           Save files created during retrieval

       The name of user files is fully under user control. However, in order to avoid possible name conflicts it
       is advisable to establish some standard conventions to be followed by all CDS/ISIS users at a given site,
       such as for example to define "yyyyyy" as follows:

         xxxyyy

       where:

       "xxx"
           is a data base identifier (which could be the first three letters of the data base  name  if  no  two
           data bases names are allowed to begin with the same three letters)

       "yyy"
           a user chosen name.

</pre><h4><b>Master</b> <b>file</b> <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>record</b> <b>format</b></h4><pre>
   <b>A.</b> <b>Master</b> <b>file</b> <b>record</b> <b>format</b>
       The  Master  record  is  a  variable length record consisting of three sections: a fixed length leader; a
       directory; and the variable length data fields.

       <u>Leader</u> <u>format</u>

       The leader consists of the following 7 integers (fields marked with * are 31-bit signed integers):

       "MFN"*
           Master file number

       "MFRL"
           Record length (always an even number)

       "MFBWB"*
           Backward pointer - Block number

       "MFBWP"
           Backward pointer - Offset

       "BASE"
           Offset to variable fields (this is the combined length of  the  Leader  and  Directory  part  of  the
           record, in bytes)

       "NVF"
           Number of fields in the record (i.e. number of directory entries)

       "STATUS"
           Logical deletion indicator (0=record active; 1=record marked for deletion)

       "MFBWB" and "MFBWP" are initially set to 0 when the record is created. They are subsequently updated each
       time the record itself is updated (see below).

       <u>Directory</u> <u>format</u>

       The  directory  is  a  table  indicating the record contents. There is one directory entry for each field
       present in, the record (i.e. the directory has exactly NVF entries). Each directory entry consists  of  3
       integers:

       "TAG"
           Field Tag

       "POS"
           Offset  to  first  character  position  of  field  in the variable field section (the first field has
           "POS=0")

       "LEN"
           Field length in bytes

       The total directory length in bytes is therefore "6*NVF"; the "BASE"  field  in  the  leader  is  always:
       "18+6*NVF".

       <u>Variable</u> <u>fields</u>

       This  section  contains the data fields (in the order indicated by the directory). Data fields are placed
       one after the other, with no separating characters.

   <b>B.</b> <b>Control</b> <b>record</b>
       The first record in the Master file is a control record which the system maintains automatically. This is
       never accessible to the ISIS user. Its contents are as follows (fields marked with "*" are 31-bit  signed
       integers):

       "CTLMFN"*
           always 0

       "NXTMFN"*
           MFN to be assigned to the next record created in the data base

       "NXTMFB"*
           Last block number allocated to the Master file (first block is 1)

       "NXTMFP"
           Offset to next available position in last block

       "MFTYPE"
           always 0 for user data base file (1 for system message files)

       (the last four fields are used for statistics during backup/restore).

   <b>C.</b> <b>Master</b> <b>file</b> <b>block</b> <b>format</b>
       The  Master  file  records  are  stored consecutively, one after the other, each record occupying exactly
       "MFRL" bytes. The file is stored as physical blocks of 512 bytes. A record may begin at any word boundary
       between 0-498 (no record begins between 500-510) and may span over two or more blocks.

       As the Master file is created and/or updated, the system maintains an index indicating  the  position  of
       each record. The index is stored in the Crossreference file (".XRF")

   <b>D.</b> <b>Crossreference</b> <b>file</b>
       The  "XRF" file is organized as a table of pointers to the Master file.  The first pointer corresponds to
       MFN 1, the second to MFN 2, etc.

       Each pointer consists of two fields:

       "RECCNT"*
       "MFCXX1"*
       "MFCXX2"*
       "MFCXX3"*
       "XRFMFB"
           (21 bits) Block number of Master file block containing the record

       "XRFMFP"
           (11 bits) Offset in block of first character position of Master record (first block position is 0)

       which are stored in a 31-bit signed integer (4 bytes) as follows:

         pointer = XRFMFB * 2048 + XRFMFP

       (giving therefore a maximum Master file size of 500 Megabytes).

       Each block of the "XRF" file is 512 bytes and contains 127  pointers.  The  first  field  in  each  block
       ("XRFPOS") is a 31-bit signed integer whose absolute value is the "XRF" block number. A negative "XRFPOS"
       indicates the last block.

       <u>Deleted</u> records are indicated as follows:

       "XRFMFB &lt; 0" and "XRFMFP &gt; 0"
           logically  deleted  record (in this case ABS(XRFMFB) is the correct block pointer and "XRFMFP" is the
           offset of the record, which can therefore still be retrieved)

       "XRFMFB = -1" and "XRFMFP = 0"
           physically deleted record

       "XRFMFB = 0" and "XRFMFP = 0"
           inexistent record (all records beyond the highest "MFN" assigned in the data base)

   <b>E.</b> <b>Master</b> <b>file</b> <b>updating</b> <b>technique</b>
       <u>Creation</u> <u>of</u> <u>new</u> <u>records</u>

       New records are always added at the end of the Master file, at  the  position  indicated  by  the  fields
       "NXTMFB"/"NXTMFP"  in  the Master file control record. The "MFN" to be assigned is also obtained from the
       field "NXTMFN" in the control record.

       After adding the record, "NXTMFN" is increased by 1 and "NXTMFB"/"NXTMFP" are updated  to  point  to  the
       next  available  position.  In addition a new pointer is created in the "XRF" file and the "XRFMFP" field
       corresponding to the record is increased by 1024 to indicate that this is a new  record  to  be  inverted
       (after the inversion of the record 1024 is subtracted from "XRFMFP").

       <u>Update</u> <u>of</u> <u>existing</u> <u>records</u>

       Whenever you update a record (i.e., you call it in data entry and exit with option X from the editor) the
       system writes the record back to the Master file. Where it is written depends on the status of the record
       when it was initially read.

       There was no inverted file update pending for the record

       This condition is indicated by the following:

       On "XRF" "XRFMFP &lt; 512" and

       On "MST" "MFBWB = 0" and "MFBWP = 0"

       In  this  case, the record is always rewritten at the end of the Master file (as if it were a new record)
       as indicated by "NXTMFB"/"NXTMFP" in the control record. In the new version of the record "MFBWB"/"MFBWP"
       are set to point to the old version of the record, while in the "XRF" file the pointer points to the  new
       version.  In  addition 512 is added to "XRFMFP" to indicate that an inverted file update is pending. When
       the inverted file is updated, the old version of the record is used  to  determine  the  postings  to  be
       deleted  and  the new version is used to add the new postings. After the update of the Inverted file, 512
       is subtracted from "XRFMFP", and "MFBWB"/"MFBWP" are reset to 0.

       An inverted file update was pending

       This condition is indicated by the following:

       On "XRF" "XRFMFP &gt; 512" and

       On "MST" "MFBWB &gt; 0"

       In this case "MFBWB"/"MFBWP" point to the version of the record  which  is  currently  reflected  in  the
       Inverted  file.  If  possible, i.e. if the record length was not increased, the record is written back at
       its original location, otherwise it is written at the end of the file. In both cases, "MFBWB"/"MFBWP" are
       not changed.

       <u>Deletion</u> <u>of</u> <u>records</u>

       Record deletion is treated as an update, with the following additional markings:

       On "XRF" "XRFMFB" is negative

       On "MST" "STATUS" is set to 1

   <b>F.</b> <b>Master</b> <b>file</b> <b>reorganization</b>
       As indicated above, as Master file records are updated the "MST" file grows in size  and  there  will  be
       lost  space  in  the  file  which  cannot  be  used. The reorganization facilities allow this space to be
       reclaimed by recompacting the file.

       During the backup phase a Master file backup file is created (".BKP").  The structure and format of  this
       file  is  the  same as the Master file (".MST"), except that a Crossreference file is not required as all
       the records are adjacent. Records marked for deletion are not backed up.  Because only the latest copy of
       each record is backed up, the system does not allow you to perform a backup  whenever  an  Inverted  file
       update is pending for one or more records.

       During  the  restore  phase  the backup file is read sequentially and the program recreates the "MST" and
       "XRF" file. At this point alt records which were marked for logical deletion (before the backup) are  now
       marked as physically deleted (by setting "XRFMFB = -1" and "XRFMFP = 0".  Deleted records are detected by
       checking holes in the "MFN" numbering.

</pre><h4><b>Inverted</b> <b>file</b> <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>record</b> <b>formats</b></h4><pre>
   <b>A.</b> <b>Introduction</b>
       The  CDS/ISIS  Inverted  file  consists  of  six  physical files, five of which contain the dictionary of
       searchable terms (organized as a B*tree) and the sixth contains the list of postings associated with each
       term. In order to optimize disk storage, two separate B*trees are maintained, one for terms of up  to  10
       characters  (stored  in files ".N01"/".L01") and one for terms longer than 10 characters, up to a maximum
       of 30 characters (stored in files ".N02"/".L02").  The  file  "CNT"  contains  control  fields  for  both
       B*trees.  In  each B*tree the file ".N0x" contains the nodes of the tree and the ".L0x" file contains the
       leafs. The leaf records point to the postings file ".IFP".

       The relationship between the various files is schematically represented in Figure 67.

       The physical relationship between these six files is a pointer, which represents the relative address  of
       the  record being pointed to. A relative address is the ordinal record number of a record in a given file
       (i.e. the first record is record number 1, the second is record number 2, etc.). The file  ".CNT"  points
       to  the file ".N0x", ".N0x" points to ".L0x", and ".L0x" points to ".IFP". Because the ".IFP" is a packed
       file, the pointer from ".L0x" to ".IFP" has two components: the block number and the  offset  within  the
       block, each expressed as an integer.

   <b>B.</b> <b>Format</b> <b>of</b> <b>".CNT"</b> <b>file</b>
       This  file  contain two 26-byte fixed length records (one for each B*tree) each containing 10 integers as
       follows (fields marked with * are 31-bit signed integers):

       "IDTYPE"
           B*tree type (1 for ".N01"/".L01", 2 for ".N02"/".L02")

       "ORDN"
           Nodes order (each ".N0x" record contains at most "2*ORDN" keys)

       "ORDF"
           Leafs order (each ".L0x" record contains at most "2*ORDF" keys)

       "N" Number of memory buffers allocated for nodes

       "K" Number of buffers allocated to lst level index ("K &lt; N")

       "LIV"
           Current number of index levels

       "POSRX"*
           Pointer to Root record in ".N0x"

       "NMAXPOS"*
           Next available position in ".N0x" file

       "FMAXPOS"*
           Next available position in ".L0x" file

       "ABNORMAL"
           Formal B*tree normality indicator (0 if B*tree is abnormal, 1 if  B*tree  is  normal).  A  B*tree  is
           abnormal if the nodes file ".N0x" contains only the Root.

       "ORDN",  "ORDF",  "N"  and "K" are fixed for a given generated system.  Currently these values are set as
       follows:

       "ORDN = 5"; "ORDF = 5"; "N = 15"; "K = 5" for both B*trees

       The other values are set as required when the B*trees are generated.

   <b>C.</b> <b>Format</b> <b>of</b> <b>".N0x"</b> <b>files</b>
       These files contain the indexes) of the dictionary of searchable terms (".N01" for terms shorter than  11
       characters  and  ".N02"  for terms longer than 10 characters). The ".N0x" file records have the following
       format (fields marked with * are 31-bit signed integers):

       "POS"*
           an integer indicating the relative record number (1 for the first record, 2 for  the  second  record,
           etc.)

       "OCK"
           an integer indicating the number of active keys in the record ( "1 &lt;= OCK &lt;= 2*ORDN" )

       "IT"
           an integer indicating the type of B*tree (1 for ".N01", 2 for ".N02")

       "IDX"
           an array of "ORDN" entries ("OCK" of which are active), each having the following format:

           "KEY"
               a fixed length character string of length ".LEx" ("LE1 =10", "LE2 = 30")

           "PUNT"
               a pointer to the ".N0x" record (if "PUNT &gt; 0") or ".L0x" record (if "PUNT &lt; 0") whose "<a href="../man1/IDX.1.html">IDX</a>(1).KEY
               =  KEY".  "PUNT  =  0"  indicates  an  inactive  entry. A positive "PUNT" indicates a branch to a
               hierarchically lower level index. The lowest level index ("PUNT &lt; 0") points  the  leafs  in  the
               ".L0x" file.

   <b>D.</b> <b>Format</b> <b>of</b> <b>".L0x"</b> <b>files</b>
       These  files contain the full dictionary of searchable terms (".L01" for terms shorter than 11 characters
       and ".L02" for terms longer than 10 characters). The  ".L0x"  file  records  have  the  following  format
       (fields marked with "*" are 31-bit signed integers):

       "POS"*
           an  integer  indicating  the relative record number (1 for the first record, 2 for the second record,
           etc.)

       "OCK"
           an integer indicating the number of active keys in the record ("1 &lt; OCK &lt;= 2*ORDF")

       "IT"
           an integer indicating the type of B*tree (1 for ".N01", 2 for ".N02")

       "PS"*
           is the immediate successor of "IDX[OCK].KEY" in this record (this is  used  to  speed  up  sequential
           access to the file)

       "IDX"
           an array of "ORDN" entries ("OCK" of which are active), each having the following format:

           "KEY"
               a fixed length character string of length "LEx" ("LE1=10", "LE2=30")

           "INFO"
               a  pointer  to  the  ".IFP"  record where the list of postings associated with "KEY" begins. This
               pointer consists of two 31-bit signed integers as follows:

               "INFO[1]"*
                       relative block number in ".IFP"

               "INFO[2]"*
                       offset (word number relative to 0) to postings list

   <b>E.</b> <b>Format</b> <b>of</b> <b>".IFP"</b> <b>file</b>
       This file contains the list of postings for each dictionary term. Each list of postings  has  the  format
       indicated  below.  The file is structured in blocks of 512 characters, where (for an initially loaded and
       compacted file) the lists of postings for each term are adjacent, except as noted below.

       The general format of each block is:

       "IFPBLK"
           a 31-bit signed integer indicating the Block number of this block (blocks are numbered from 1)

       "IFPREC"
           An array of 127 31-bit signed integers

       "IFPREC[1]" and "FPREC[2]" of the first block are a pointer to the next available position in the  ".IFP"
       file.

       Pointers  from  ".L0x"  to  ".IFP"  and pointers within ".IFP" consist of two 31-bit signed integers: the
       first integer is a block number, and the second integer is a word offset in "IFPREC" (e.g. the offset  to
       the  first  word  in  "IFPREC"  is  0).  The  list of postings associated with the first search term will
       therefore start at 1/0.

       Each list of postings consists of a header (5 double-words) followed by the actual list  of  postings  (8
       bytes for each posting). The header has the following format (each field is a 31-bit signed integer):

       "IFPNXTB"*
           Pointer to next segment (Block number)

       "IFPNXTP"*
           Pointer to next segment (offset)

       "IFPTOTP"*
           Total number of postings (accurate only in first segment)

       "IFPSEGP"*
           Number of postings in this segment ("IFPSEGP &lt;= IFPTOTP")

       "IFPSEGC"*
           Segment capacity (i.e. number of postings which can be stored in this segment)

       Each posting is a 64-bit string partitioned as follows:

       "PMFN"
           (24 bits) Master file number

       "PTAG"
           (16 bits) Field identifier (assigned from the "FST")

       "POCC"
           (8 bits) Occurrence number

       "PCNT"
           (16 bits) Term sequence number in field

       Each  field  is stored in a strict left-to-right sequence with leading zeros added if necessary to adjust
       the corresponding bit string to the right (this allows comparisons of two postings as character strings).

       The list of postings is stored in ascending "PMFN"/"PTAG"/"POCC"/"PCNT" sequence. When the inverted  file
       is  loaded  sequentially (e.g. after a full inverted file generation with ISISINV), each list consists of
       one or more adjacent segments. If "IFPTOT &lt;= 32768" then: "IFPNXTB/IFPNXTP = 0/0" and "IFPTOT = IFPSEGP =
       IFPSEGC".

       As updates are performed, additional segments may be created whenever new postings must be added. In this
       case a new segment with capacity "IFPTOTP" is created and linked to other segments (through  the  pointer
       "IFPNXTB"/"IFPNXTP")  in such a way that the sequence "PMFN"/"PTAG"/"POCC"/"PCNT" is maintained. Whenever
       such a split occurs the postings of the segment where the new  posting  should  have  been  inserted  are
       equally  distributed between this segment and the newly created segment.  New segments are always written
       at the end of the file (which is maintained in "IFPREC[1]"/"IFPREC[2]" of the first ".IFP" block.

       For example, assume that a new posting "Px" has to be inserted between "P2" and  "P3"  in  the  following
       list:

        +----------------------------+
        | 0 0 5 5 5 | P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 |
        +----------------------------+

       after  the  split  (and  assuming that the next available position in ".IFP" is 3/4) the list of postings
       will consist of the following two segments:

        +----------------------------+
        | 3 4 5 3 5 | P2 P2 Px -- -- |
        +--|-------------------------+
           |
        +--V-------------------------+
        | 0 0 5 3 5 | P3 P4 P5 -- -- |
        +----------------------------+

       In this situation, no new segment will be created until either segment becomes again full.

       As mentioned above, the posting lists are normally stored one after  the  other.  However,  in  order  to
       facilitate access to the ".IFP" file the segments are stored in such a way that:

       1.  the header and the first posting in each list (28 bytes) are never split between two blocks.

       2.  a  posting  is  never  split between two blocks; if there is not enough room in the current block the
           whole posting is stored in the next block.
