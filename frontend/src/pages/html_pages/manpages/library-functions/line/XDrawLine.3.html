       XDrawLine, XDrawLines, XDrawSegments, XSegment - draw lines, polygons, and line structure

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>

       int XDrawLine(Display *<u>display</u>, Drawable <u>d</u>, GC <u>gc</u>, int <u>x1</u>, int <u>y1</u>, int <u>x2</u>, int <u>y2</u>);

       int XDrawLines(Display *<u>display</u>, Drawable <u>d</u>, GC <u>gc</u>, XPoint *<u>points</u>, int <u>npoints</u>, int <u>mode</u>);

       int XDrawSegments(Display *<u>display</u>, Drawable <u>d</u>, GC <u>gc</u>, XSegment *<u>segments</u>, int <u>nsegments</u>);

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>d</u>         Specifies the drawable.

       <u>display</u>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <u>gc</u>        Specifies the GC.

       <u>mode</u>      Specifies the coordinate mode.  You can pass <b>CoordModeOrigin</b> or <b>CoordModePrevious</b>.

       <u>npoints</u>   Specifies the number of points in the array.

       <u>nsegments</u> Specifies the number of segments in the array.

       <u>points</u>    Specifies an array of points.

       <u>segments</u>  Specifies an array of segments.

       <u>x1</u>
       <u>y1</u>
       <u>x2</u>
       <u>y2</u>        Specify the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) to be connected.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>XDrawLine</b>  function uses the components of the specified GC to draw a line between the specified set
       of points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).  It does not perform joining at coincident  endpoints.   For  any  given
       line,  <b>XDrawLine</b>  does  not draw a pixel more than once.  If lines intersect, the intersecting pixels are
       drawn multiple times.

       The <b>XDrawLines</b> function uses the components of the specified GC to draw npoints-1 lines between each pair
       of points (point[i], point[i+1]) in the array of <b>XPoint</b> structures.  It draws  the  lines  in  the  order
       listed  in  the  array.   The  lines join correctly at all intermediate points, and if the first and last
       points coincide, the first and last lines also join correctly.  For any given line, <b>XDrawLines</b>  does  not
       draw  a  pixel  more  than  once.  If thin (zero line-width) lines intersect, the intersecting pixels are
       drawn multiple times.  If wide lines intersect, the intersecting pixels are drawn only  once,  as  though
       the entire <b>PolyLine</b> protocol request were a single, filled shape.  <b>CoordModeOrigin</b> treats all coordinates
       as  relative  to  the origin, and <b>CoordModePrevious</b> treats all coordinates after the first as relative to
       the previous point.

       The <b>XDrawSegments</b> function draws multiple, unconnected lines.  For each segment,  <b>XDrawSegments</b>  draws  a
       line  between  (x1,  y1)  and  (x2, y2).  It draws the lines in the order listed in the array of <b>XSegment</b>
       structures and does not perform joining at coincident endpoints.  For any given line, <b>XDrawSegments</b>  does
       not draw a pixel more than once.  If lines intersect, the intersecting pixels are drawn multiple times.

       All  three  functions  use  these GC components: function, plane-mask, line-width, line-style, cap-style,
       fill-style, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.  The  <b>XDrawLines</b>  function  also
       uses  the  join-style  GC  component.   All  three functions also use these GC mode-dependent components:
       foreground, background, tile, stipple,  tile-stipple-x-origin,  tile-stipple-y-origin,  dash-offset,  and
       dash-list.

       <b>XDrawLine</b>,   <b>XDrawLines</b>,  and  <b>XDrawSegments</b>  can  generate  <b>BadDrawable</b>,  <b>BadGC</b>,  and  <b>BadMatch</b>  errors.
       <b>XDrawLines</b> can also generate a <b>BadValue</b> error.

</pre><h4><b>STRUCTURES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>XSegment</b> structure contains:

       typedef struct {
               short x1, y1, x2, y2;
       } XSegment;

       All x and y members are signed integers.  The width and height members are 16-bit unsigned integers.  You
       should be careful not to generate coordinates and sizes out of the 16-bit ranges,  because  the  protocol
       only has 16-bit fields for these values.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BadDrawable</b>
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window or Pixmap.

       <b>BadGC</b>     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GContext.

       <b>BadMatch</b>  An <b>InputOnly</b> window is used as a Drawable.

       <b>BadMatch</b>  Some  argument  or  pair of arguments has the correct type and range but fails to match in some
                 other way required by the request.

       <b>BadValue</b>  Some numeric value falls outside the range  of  values  accepted  by  the  request.   Unless  a
                 specific  range  is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.
