</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       THREED - 3-d line drawing package.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CURVE3 - Draws the projection of a curve defined by a sequence of points in 3-space.

       FENCE3 - Draws the projection of a curve, just as CURVE3 does, but with a "fence" of straight line
       segments that are parallel to one of the three axes and that extend to a specified plane perpendicular to
       that axis.

       FRST3 - Specifies the first in a sequence of points connected by straight-line segments, the projections
       of which are to be drawn. (FRST3 is called for the first point in the sequence and VECT3 is called for
       the rest.)

       LINE3 - Draws the projection of a straight-line segment.

       PERIM3 - Draws the projection of a rectangular perimeter in a plane parallel to one of the three
       coordinate planes, with inward-pointing tick marks at specified intervals.

       POINT3 - Draws the projection of a point.

       PWRZT - Draws the projection of character strings that are positioned in a plane parallel to one of the
       three coordinate planes.

       SET3 - Defines the transformation from three dimensions to two dimensions.

       TICK43 - Gives user control of tick mark length in PERIM3.

       VECT3 - Defines the second and all subsequent points in a sequence of points connected by straight-line
       segments, the projections of which are to be drawn. (FRST3 is called for the first point in the sequence
       and VECT3 is called for the rest.)
