</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dashline - A set of line-drawing routines that can be used to generate various dashed line patterns
       (including solid), can add labels to the lines, can smooth the lines, and can suppress crowding of lines.
       There are four different versions of Dashline: "normal", "quick", "smooth", and "super".  See the ACCESS
       Section for details on how to invoke the various versions.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       DASHDB -  Defines a dash pattern without labels.

       DASHDC -  Defines  a  dash pattern with labels.  If DASHDC is called when the "quick" version of Dashline
                 is used, an error exit results.

       FRSTD  -  Defines the first of a sequence of points through which a curve is to be drawn.

       VECTD  -  Defines the second and following of a sequence of points through which a curve is to be drawn.

       LASTD  -  Terminates a sequence of calls to draw a curve (a call to FRSTD followed by one or  more  calls
                 to VECTD).

       LINED  -  Draws a straight line segment between two points.

       CURVED -  Draws a curve through a sequence of points.

       RESET  -  The  "super"  version  of RESET zeroes the internal integer array used to detect crowded lines;
                 other versions do nothing.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The Dashline utility allows you to draw various kinds of lines.  In  all  four  versions  of  it  (quick,
       normal,  smooth  and  super),  you can specify an arbitrary dash pattern for the lines (including a solid
       line).  In all but the quick version, you can also add interspersed labels to the lines for purposes such
       as naming lines in an XY plot or assigning contour levels to contour lines.   In  the  smooth  and  super
       versions, the lines can also be smoothed using splines under tension.

       Warning:  You  must  be careful when using the smoothing option.  Allowing a high degree of smoothing may
                 have serious side effects, such as XY curves with multiple  valued  loops  and  contours  which
                 cross over other contours.

       The super version additionally allows for the culling of crowded lines.  In order for the culling process
       to  work  properly,  the  routine RESET must be called at the beginning of each picture; when using other
       versions of Dashline, the calls to RESET may be left in, as they then do nothing.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use the normal version of the Dashline utility, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and
       ncarg_c, preferably in that order.  Other optional libraries to  create  the  quick,  smooth,  and  super
       versions  of Dashline are automatically linked in by the ncargf77 command.  If you need to know the names
       of these libraries for a  particular  version  of  Dashline,  execute  an  "ncargf77"  command  with  the
       appropriate  option  and  a  dummy  input  file and examine the resulting command line that is echoed and
       executed.

       To run a code called mycode.f which has one or more calls to Dashline entries, issue one of the commands:

       NORMAL    Command:  "ncargf77 mycode.f"

                 The lines will be drawn as unsmoothed dashed or solid lines.  DASHDC may be called to define  a
                 dash pattern with labels.

       QUICK     Command:  "ncargf77 -quick mycode.f"

                 The  lines will be drawn as unsmoothed dashed or solid lines.  The dash pattern may not include
                 labels.  If DASHDC is called, an error exit will result; DASHDB must be used instead.

       SMOOTH    Command:  "ncargf77 -smooth mycode.f"

                 The lines will be drawn as dashed or solid lines, smoothed using splines under tension.  DASHDC
                 may be called to define a dash pattern with labels.

       SUPER     Command:  "ncargf77 -super mycode.f"

                 The lines will be drawn as dashed or solid lines, smoothed using splines under tension.  DASHDC
                 may be called to define a dash pattern with labels.  Crowded lines will be  thinned;  in  order
                 for this to work properly, you must remember to call RESET at the beginning of each picture.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       When  error  conditions  are detected, the support routine SETER is called in such a way that it writes a
       message to the standard error file (as defined by <a href="../man4/I1MACH.4.html">I1MACH</a>(4)) and then terminates execution. The  possible
       error messages are as follows:

       CFVLD  -- VECTD CALL OCCURS BEFORE A CALL TO FRSTD
              You must call FRSTD before the first call to VECTD.

       DASHDB -- BLOCKDATA DASHBD APPARENTLY NOT LOADED CORRECTLY
              If  you have used the ncargf77 command options as discussed in the ACCESS Section, see your system
              administrator.

       DASHDC -- BLOCKDATA DASHBD APPARENTLY NOT LOADED CORRECTLY
              You have called DASHDC when using the "quick" version of Dashline.  This is not allowed.

       FDVDLD -- VECTD CALL OCCURS BEFORE A CALL TO FRSTD
              You must call FRSTD before the first call to VECTD.
