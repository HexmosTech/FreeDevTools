</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       JSON - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) encoder/decoder

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use JSON; # imports encode_json, decode_json, to_json and from_json.

        # simple and fast interfaces (expect/generate UTF-8)

        $utf8_encoded_json_text = encode_json $perl_hash_or_arrayref;
        $perl_hash_or_arrayref  = decode_json $utf8_encoded_json_text;

        # OO-interface

        $json = JSON-&gt;new-&gt;allow_nonref;

        $json_text   = $json-&gt;encode( $perl_scalar );
        $perl_scalar = $json-&gt;decode( $json_text );

        $pretty_printed = $json-&gt;pretty-&gt;encode( $perl_scalar ); # pretty-printing

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is a thin wrapper for JSON::XS-compatible modules with a few additional features. All the
       backend modules convert a Perl data structure to a JSON text and vice versa. This module uses JSON::XS by
       default, and when JSON::XS is not available, falls back on JSON::PP, which is in the Perl core since
       5.14. If JSON::PP is not available either, this module then falls back on JSON::backportPP (which is
       actually JSON::PP in a different .pm file) bundled in the same distribution as this module.  You can also
       explicitly specify to use Cpanel::JSON::XS, a fork of JSON::XS by Reini Urban.

       All these backend modules have slight incompatibilities between them, including extra features that other
       modules don't support, but as long as you use only common features (most important ones are described
       below), migration from backend to backend should be reasonably easy. For details, see each backend module
       you use.

</pre><h4><b>CHOOSING</b> <b>BACKEND</b></h4><pre>
       This module respects an environmental variable called "PERL_JSON_BACKEND" when it decides a backend
       module to use. If this environmental variable is not set, it tries to load JSON::XS, and if JSON::XS is
       not available, it falls back on JSON::PP, and then JSON::backportPP if JSON::PP is not available either.

       If you always don't want it to fall back on pure perl modules, set the variable like this ("export" may
       be "setenv", "set" and the likes, depending on your environment):

         &gt; export PERL_JSON_BACKEND=JSON::XS

       If you prefer Cpanel::JSON::XS to JSON::XS, then:

         &gt; export PERL_JSON_BACKEND=Cpanel::JSON::XS,JSON::XS,JSON::PP

       You may also want to set this variable at the top of your test files, in order not to be bothered with
       incompatibilities between backends (you need to wrap this in "BEGIN", and set before actually "use"-ing
       JSON module, as it decides its backend as soon as it's loaded):

         BEGIN { $ENV{PERL_JSON_BACKEND}='JSON::backportPP'; }
         use JSON;

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>OPTIONAL</b> <b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       There are a few options you can set when you "use" this module.  These historical options are only kept
       for backward compatibility, and should not be used in a new application.

       -support_by_pp
              BEGIN { $ENV{PERL_JSON_BACKEND} = 'JSON::XS' }

              use JSON -support_by_pp;

              my $json = JSON-&gt;new;
              # escape_slash is for JSON::PP only.
              $json-&gt;allow_nonref-&gt;escape_slash-&gt;encode("/");

           With  this  option, this module loads its pure perl backend along with its XS backend (if available),
           and lets the XS backend to watch if you set a flag only JSON::PP supports. When you do, the  internal
           JSON::XS  object is replaced with a newly created JSON::PP object with the setting copied from the XS
           object, so that you can use JSON::PP flags (and its slower "decode"/"encode" methods) from  then  on.
           In  other  words, this is not something that allows you to hook JSON::XS to change its behavior while
           keeping its speed. JSON::XS and JSON::PP objects are quite different (JSON::XS object  is  a  blessed
           scalar  reference,  while  JSON::PP  object  is  a  blessed  hash  reference),  and can't share their
           internals.

           To avoid needless overhead (by copying settings), you are advised not to use this option and just  to
           use JSON::PP explicitly when you need JSON::PP features.

       -convert_blessed_universally
              use JSON -convert_blessed_universally;

              my $json = JSON-&gt;new-&gt;allow_nonref-&gt;convert_blessed;
              my $object = bless {foo =&gt; 'bar'}, 'Foo';
              $json-&gt;encode($object); # =&gt; {"foo":"bar"}

           JSON::XS-compatible backend modules don't encode blessed objects by default (except for their boolean
           values,  which  are  typically  blessed  JSON::PP::Boolean  objects).  If  you  need to encode a data
           structure that may contain objects, you usually need to look into the structure and  replace  objects
           with  alternative  non-blessed values, or enable "convert_blessed" and provide a "TO_JSON" method for
           each object's (base) class that may be found in the structure, in order to let  the  methods  replace
           the objects with whatever scalar values the methods return.

           If  you need to serialise data structures that may contain arbitrary objects, it's probably better to
           use other serialisers (such as Sereal or Storable for example), but if you do want to use this module
           for that purpose, "-convert_blessed_universally" option may help, which tweaks "encode" method of the
           backend to install "UNIVERSAL::TO_JSON" method (locally) before encoding, so  that  all  the  objects
           that  don't have their own "TO_JSON" method can fall back on the method in the "UNIVERSAL" namespace.
           Note that you still need to enable "convert_blessed" flag  to  actually  encode  objects  in  a  data
           structure,  and "UNIVERSAL::TO_JSON" method installed by this option only converts blessed hash/array
           references into their unblessed clone (including private keys/values that  are  not  supposed  to  be
           exposed). Other blessed references will be converted into null.

           This feature is experimental and may be removed in the future.

       -no_export
           When  you  don't  want  to import functional interfaces from a module, you usually supply "()" to its
           "use" statement.

               use JSON (); # no functional interfaces

           If you don't want to import functional interfaces, but you also want to use any of the above options,
           add "-no_export" to the option list.

              # no functional interfaces, while JSON::PP support is enabled.
              use JSON -support_by_pp, -no_export;

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONAL</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       This section is taken from JSON::XS. "encode_json" and "decode_json" are exported by default.

       This module also exports "to_json" and "from_json" for backward compatibility. These are slower, and  may
       expect/generate different stuff from what "encode_json" and "decode_json" do, depending on their options.
       It's better just to use Object-Oriented interfaces than using these two functions.

   <b>encode_json</b>
           $json_text = encode_json $perl_scalar

       Converts  the  given  Perl data structure to a UTF-8 encoded, binary string (that is, the string contains
       octets only). Croaks on error.

       This function call is functionally identical to:

           $json_text = JSON-&gt;new-&gt;utf8-&gt;encode($perl_scalar)

       Except being faster.

   <b>decode_json</b>
           $perl_scalar = decode_json $json_text

       The opposite of "encode_json": expects an UTF-8 (binary) string and tries  to  parse  that  as  an  UTF-8
       encoded JSON text, returning the resulting reference. Croaks on error.

       This function call is functionally identical to:

           $perl_scalar = JSON-&gt;new-&gt;utf8-&gt;decode($json_text)

       Except being faster.

   <b>to_json</b>
          $json_text = to_json($perl_scalar[, $optional_hashref])

       Converts the given Perl data structure to a Unicode string by default.  Croaks on error.

       Basically, this function call is functionally identical to:

          $json_text = JSON-&gt;new-&gt;encode($perl_scalar)

       Except being slower.

       You  can  pass  an  optional  hash  reference  to modify its behavior, but that may change what "to_json"
       expects/generates (see "ENCODING/CODESET FLAG NOTES" for details).

          $json_text = to_json($perl_scalar, {utf8 =&gt; 1, pretty =&gt; 1})
          # =&gt; JSON-&gt;new-&gt;<a href="../man1/utf8.1.html">utf8</a>(1)-&gt;<a href="../man1/pretty.1.html">pretty</a>(1)-&gt;encode($perl_scalar)

   <b>from_json</b>
          $perl_scalar = from_json($json_text[, $optional_hashref])

       The opposite of "to_json": expects a Unicode string and  tries  to  parse  it,  returning  the  resulting
       reference. Croaks on error.

       Basically, this function call is functionally identical to:

           $perl_scalar = JSON-&gt;new-&gt;decode($json_text)

       You  can  pass  an  optional  hash reference to modify its behavior, but that may change what "from_json"
       expects/generates (see "ENCODING/CODESET FLAG NOTES" for details).

           $perl_scalar = from_json($json_text, {utf8 =&gt; 1})
           # =&gt; JSON-&gt;new-&gt;<a href="../man1/utf8.1.html">utf8</a>(1)-&gt;decode($json_text)

   <b>JSON::is_bool</b>
           $is_boolean = JSON::is_bool($scalar)

       Returns true if the passed scalar represents either JSON::true or JSON::false,  two  constants  that  act
       like 1 and 0 respectively and are also used to represent JSON "true" and "false" in Perl strings.

       See MAPPING, below, for more information on how JSON values are mapped to Perl.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>OBJECT-ORIENTED</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       This section is also taken from JSON::XS.

       The  object  oriented interface lets you configure your own encoding or decoding style, within the limits
       of supported formats.

   <b>new</b>
           $json = JSON-&gt;new

       Creates a new JSON::XS-compatible backend object that can be used to de/encode JSON strings. All  boolean
       flags  described  below  are by default <u>disabled</u> (with the exception of "allow_nonref", which defaults to
       <u>enabled</u> since version 4.0).

       The mutators for flags all return the backend object again and thus calls can be chained:

          my $json = JSON-&gt;new-&gt;utf8-&gt;space_after-&gt;encode({a =&gt; [1,2]})
          =&gt; {"a": [1, 2]}

   <b>ascii</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;ascii([$enable])

           $enabled = $json-&gt;get_ascii

       If $enable is true (or missing), then the "encode" method will not generate characters outside  the  code
       range  0..127  (which is ASCII). Any Unicode characters outside that range will be escaped using either a
       single \uXXXX (BMP characters) or a double \uHHHH\uLLLLL escape sequence, as per RFC4627.  The  resulting
       encoded  JSON  text  can be treated as a native Unicode string, an ascii-encoded, latin1-encoded or UTF-8
       encoded string, or any other superset of ASCII.

       If $enable is false, then the "encode" method will not escape Unicode characters unless required  by  the
       JSON syntax or other flags. This results in a faster and more compact format.

       See also the section <u>ENCODING/CODESET</u> <u>FLAG</u> <u>NOTES</u> later in this document.

       The  main use for this flag is to produce JSON texts that can be transmitted over a 7-bit channel, as the
       encoded JSON texts will not contain any 8 bit characters.

         JSON-&gt;new-&gt;<a href="../man1/ascii.1.html">ascii</a>(1)-&gt;encode([chr 0x10401])
         =&gt; ["\ud801\udc01"]

   <b>latin1</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;latin1([$enable])

           $enabled = $json-&gt;get_latin1

       If $enable is true (or missing), then the "encode" method will encode the resulting JSON text  as  latin1
       (or  iso-8859-1),  escaping  any  characters  outside  the code range 0..255. The resulting string can be
       treated as a latin1-encoded JSON text or a native  Unicode  string.  The  "decode"  method  will  not  be
       affected  in  any way by this flag, as "decode" by default expects Unicode, which is a strict superset of
       latin1.

       If $enable is false, then the "encode" method will not escape Unicode characters unless required  by  the
       JSON syntax or other flags.

       See also the section <u>ENCODING/CODESET</u> <u>FLAG</u> <u>NOTES</u> later in this document.

       The  main  use for this flag is efficiently encoding binary data as JSON text, as most octets will not be
       escaped, resulting in a smaller encoded size. The disadvantage is that the resulting JSON text is encoded
       in latin1 (and must correctly be treated as such when storing and  transferring),  a  rare  encoding  for
       JSON.  It  is  therefore  most useful when you want to store data structures known to contain binary data
       efficiently in files or databases, not when talking to other JSON encoders/decoders.

         JSON-&gt;new-&gt;latin1-&gt;encode (["\x{89}\x{abc}"]
         =&gt; ["\x{89}\\u0abc"]    # (perl syntax, U+abc escaped, U+89 not)

   <b>utf8</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;utf8([$enable])

           $enabled = $json-&gt;get_utf8

       If $enable is true (or missing), then the "encode" method will encode the  JSON  result  into  UTF-8,  as
       required  by  many  protocols,  while  the "decode" method expects to be handled an UTF-8-encoded string.
       Please note that UTF-8-encoded strings do not contain any characters outside the range 0..255,  they  are
       thus  useful for bytewise/binary I/O. In future versions, enabling this option might enable autodetection
       of the UTF-16 and UTF-32 encoding families, as described in RFC4627.

       If $enable is false, then the "encode" method will return the JSON  string  as  a  (non-encoded)  Unicode
       string, while "decode" expects thus a Unicode string.  Any decoding or encoding (e.g. to UTF-8 or UTF-16)
       needs to be done yourself, e.g. using the Encode module.

       See also the section <u>ENCODING/CODESET</u> <u>FLAG</u> <u>NOTES</u> later in this document.

       Example, output UTF-16BE-encoded JSON:

         use Encode;
         $jsontext = encode "UTF-16BE", JSON-&gt;new-&gt;encode ($object);

       Example, decode UTF-32LE-encoded JSON:

         use Encode;
         $object = JSON-&gt;new-&gt;decode (decode "UTF-32LE", $jsontext);

   <b>pretty</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;pretty([$enable])

       This  enables  (or  disables)  all  of  the "indent", "space_before" and "space_after" (and in the future
       possibly more) flags in one call to generate the most readable (or most compact) form possible.

   <b>indent</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;indent([$enable])

           $enabled = $json-&gt;get_indent

       If $enable is true (or missing), then the "encode" method will use a multiline format as output,  putting
       every array member or object/hash key-value pair into its own line, indenting them properly.

       If $enable is false, no newlines or indenting will be produced, and the resulting JSON text is guaranteed
       not to contain any "newlines".

       This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.

   <b>space_before</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;space_before([$enable])

           $enabled = $json-&gt;get_space_before

       If $enable is true (or missing), then the "encode" method will add an extra optional space before the ":"
       separating keys from values in JSON objects.

       If $enable is false, then the "encode" method will not add any extra space at those places.

       This  setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts. You will also most likely combine this setting with
       "space_after".

       Example, space_before enabled, space_after and indent disabled:

          {"key" :"value"}

   <b>space_after</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;space_after([$enable])

           $enabled = $json-&gt;get_space_after

       If $enable is true (or missing), then the "encode" method will add an extra optional space after the  ":"
       separating keys from values in JSON objects and extra whitespace after the "," separating key-value pairs
       and array members.

       If $enable is false, then the "encode" method will not add any extra space at those places.

       This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.

       Example, space_before and indent disabled, space_after enabled:

          {"key": "value"}

   <b>relaxed</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;relaxed([$enable])

           $enabled = $json-&gt;get_relaxed

       If  $enable  is  true  (or missing), then "decode" will accept some extensions to normal JSON syntax (see
       below). "encode" will not be affected in any way. <u>Be</u> <u>aware</u> <u>that</u> <u>this</u> <u>option</u> <u>makes</u> <u>you</u> <u>accept</u> <u>invalid</u> <u>JSON</u>
       <u>texts</u> <u>as</u> <u>if</u> <u>they</u> <u>were</u> <u>valid!</u>. I suggest only to use  this  option  to  parse  application-specific  files
       written by humans (configuration files, resource files etc.)

       If $enable is false (the default), then "decode" will only accept valid JSON texts.

       Currently accepted extensions are:

       •   list items can have an end-comma

           JSON <u>separates</u> array elements and key-value pairs with commas. This can be annoying if you write JSON
           texts manually and want to be able to quickly append elements, so this extension accepts comma at the
           end of such items not just between them:

              [
                 1,
                 2, &lt;- this comma not normally allowed
              ]
              {
                 "k1": "v1",
                 "k2": "v2", &lt;- this comma not normally allowed
              }

       •   shell-style '#'-comments

           Whenever  JSON  allows whitespace, shell-style comments are additionally allowed. They are terminated
           by the first carriage-return or line-feed character, after which more white-space  and  comments  are
           allowed.

             [
                1, # this comment not allowed in JSON
                   # neither this one...
             ]

   <b>canonical</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;canonical([$enable])

           $enabled = $json-&gt;get_canonical

       If $enable is true (or missing), then the "encode" method will output JSON objects by sorting their keys.
       This is adding a comparatively high overhead.

       If  $enable  is false, then the "encode" method will output key-value pairs in the order Perl stores them
       (which will likely change between runs of the same script, and can change even within the same  run  from
       5.18 onwards).

       This  option is useful if you want the same data structure to be encoded as the same JSON text (given the
       same overall settings). If it is disabled, the same hash might be encoded differently  even  if  contains
       the same data, as key-value pairs have no inherent ordering in Perl.

       This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.

       This setting has currently no effect on tied hashes.

   <b>allow_nonref</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;allow_nonref([$enable])

           $enabled = $json-&gt;get_allow_nonref

       Unlike other boolean options, this option is enabled by default beginning with version 4.0.

       If  $enable  is  true  (or  missing),  then  the  "encode"  method  can  convert a non-reference into its
       corresponding string, number or null JSON value, which is an extension  to  RFC4627.  Likewise,  "decode"
       will accept those JSON values instead of croaking.

       If  $enable  is  false, then the "encode" method will croak if it isn't passed an arrayref or hashref, as
       JSON texts must either be an object or array. Likewise, "decode" will croak if given  something  that  is
       not a JSON object or array.

       Example,  encode  a  Perl  scalar as JSON value with enabled "allow_nonref", resulting in an invalid JSON
       text:

          JSON-&gt;new-&gt;allow_nonref-&gt;encode ("Hello, World!")
          =&gt; "Hello, World!"

   <b>allow_unknown</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;allow_unknown ([$enable])

           $enabled = $json-&gt;get_allow_unknown

       If $enable is true (or missing), then "encode" will <u>not</u> throw an exception when it encounters  values  it
       cannot  represent  in  JSON  (for example, filehandles) but instead will encode a JSON "null" value. Note
       that blessed objects are not included here and are handled separately by c&lt;allow_blessed&gt;.

       If $enable is false (the default), then "encode" will throw an exception when it encounters  anything  it
       cannot encode as JSON.

       This  option  does  not affect "decode" in any way, and it is recommended to leave it off unless you know
       your communications partner.

   <b>allow_blessed</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;allow_blessed([$enable])

           $enabled = $json-&gt;get_allow_blessed

       See "OBJECT SERIALISATION" for details.

       If $enable is true (or missing), then the "encode" method will not barf  when  it  encounters  a  blessed
       reference  that  it  cannot  convert  otherwise.  Instead,  a JSON "null" value is encoded instead of the
       object.

       If $enable is false (the default), then "encode" will throw an exception when  it  encounters  a  blessed
       object that it cannot convert otherwise.

       This setting has no effect on "decode".

   <b>convert_blessed</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;convert_blessed([$enable])

           $enabled = $json-&gt;get_convert_blessed

       See "OBJECT SERIALISATION" for details.

       If  $enable  is  true (or missing), then "encode", upon encountering a blessed object, will check for the
       availability of the "TO_JSON" method on the object's class. If found, it will be called in scalar context
       and the resulting scalar will be encoded instead of the object.

       The "TO_JSON" method may safely call die if it wants. If "TO_JSON" returns other blessed  objects,  those
       will  be  handled in the same way. "TO_JSON" must take care of not causing an endless recursion cycle (==
       crash) in this case. The name of "TO_JSON" was chosen because other methods called by the Perl  core  (==
       not  by  the  user  of  the  object)  are  usually in upper case letters and to avoid collisions with any
       "to_json" function or method.

       If $enable is false (the default), then "encode" will not consider this type of conversion.

       This setting has no effect on "decode".

   <b>allow_tags</b> <b>(since</b> <b>version</b> <b>3.0)</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;allow_tags([$enable])

           $enabled = $json-&gt;get_allow_tags

       See "OBJECT SERIALISATION" for details.

       If $enable is true (or missing), then "encode", upon encountering a blessed object, will  check  for  the
       availability  of  the  "FREEZE"  method on the object's class. If found, it will be used to serialise the
       object into a nonstandard tagged JSON value (that JSON decoders cannot decode).

       It also causes "decode" to parse such tagged JSON values and deserialise them via a call  to  the  "THAW"
       method.

       If  $enable  is  false (the default), then "encode" will not consider this type of conversion, and tagged
       JSON values will cause a parse error in "decode", as if tags were not part of the grammar.

   <b>boolean_values</b> <b>(since</b> <b>version</b> <b>4.0)</b>
           $json-&gt;boolean_values([$false, $true])

           ($false,  $true) = $json-&gt;get_boolean_values

       By default, JSON booleans will be decoded as overloaded $JSON::false and $JSON::true objects.

       With this method you can specify your own boolean values for decoding - on decode, JSON "false"  will  be
       decoded  as  a copy of $false, and JSON "true" will be decoded as $true ("copy" here is the same thing as
       assigning a value to another variable, i.e. "$copy = $false").

       This is useful when you want to pass a decoded data structure directly to other  serialisers  like  YAML,
       Data::MessagePack and so on.

       Note that this works only when you "decode". You can set incompatible boolean objects (like boolean), but
       when  you "encode" a data structure with such boolean objects, you still need to enable "convert_blessed"
       (and add a "TO_JSON" method if necessary).

       Calling this method without any arguments will reset the booleans to their default values.

       "get_boolean_values" will return both $false and $true values, or the empty list when they are set to the
       default.

   <b>filter_json_object</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;filter_json_object([$coderef])

       When $coderef is specified, it will be called from "decode" each time it decodes a JSON object. The  only
       argument  is a reference to the newly-created hash. If the code references returns a single scalar (which
       need not be a reference), this value (or rather a copy of it) is  inserted  into  the  deserialised  data
       structure.  If  it  returns  an  empty  list  (NOTE:  <u>not</u> "undef", which is a valid scalar), the original
       deserialised hash will be inserted. This setting can slow down decoding considerably.

       When $coderef is omitted or undefined, any existing callback will be removed and "decode" will not change
       the deserialised hash in any way.

       Example, convert all JSON objects into the integer 5:

          my $js = JSON-&gt;new-&gt;filter_json_object(sub { 5 });
          # returns [5]
          $js-&gt;decode('[{}]');
          # returns 5
          $js-&gt;decode('{"a":1, "b":2}');

   <b>filter_json_single_key_object</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;filter_json_single_key_object($key [=&gt; $coderef])

       Works remotely similar to "filter_json_object", but is only called for JSON objects having a  single  key
       named $key.

       This  $coderef  is  called  before the one specified via "filter_json_object", if any. It gets passed the
       single value in the JSON object. If it returns a  single  value,  it  will  be  inserted  into  the  data
       structure.   If   it  returns  nothing  (not  even  "undef"  but  the  empty  list),  the  callback  from
       "filter_json_object" will be called next, as if no single-key callback were specified.

       If $coderef is omitted or undefined, the corresponding callback will be disabled. There can only ever  be
       one callback for a given key.

       As  this  callback  gets  called  less  often  then the "filter_json_object" one, decoding speed will not
       usually suffer as much. Therefore, single-key objects make excellent targets to  serialise  Perl  objects
       into,  especially  as  single-key JSON objects are as close to the type-tagged value concept as JSON gets
       (it's basically an ID/VALUE tuple). Of course, JSON does not support this in any way, so you need to make
       sure your data never looks like a serialised Perl hash.

       Typical names for the single object key are "__class_whatever__", or  "$__dollars_are_rarely_used__$"  or
       "}ugly_brace_placement",  or  even  things  like  "__class_md5sum(classname)__",  to  reduce  the risk of
       clashing with real hashes.

       Example, decode JSON objects of the form "{ "__widget__" =&gt; &lt;id&gt; }" into the corresponding  $WIDGET{&lt;id&gt;}
       object:

          # return whatever is in $WIDGET{5}:
          JSON
             -&gt;new
             -&gt;filter_json_single_key_object (__widget__ =&gt; sub {
                   $WIDGET{ $_[0] }
                })
             -&gt;decode ('{"__widget__": 5')

          # this can be used with a TO_JSON method in some "widget" class
          # for serialisation to json:
          sub WidgetBase::TO_JSON {
             my ($self) = @_;

             unless ($self-&gt;{id}) {
                $self-&gt;{id} = ..get..some..id..;
                $WIDGET{$self-&gt;{id}} = $self;
             }

             { __widget__ =&gt; $self-&gt;{id} }
          }

   <b>max_depth</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;max_depth([$maximum_nesting_depth])

           $max_depth = $json-&gt;get_max_depth

       Sets  the  maximum  nesting  level (default 512) accepted while encoding or decoding. If a higher nesting
       level is detected in JSON text or a Perl data structure, then the encoder and decoder will stop and croak
       at that point.

       Nesting level is defined by number of hash- or arrayrefs that the encoder needs to traverse  to  reach  a
       given  point or the number of "{" or "[" characters without their matching closing parenthesis crossed to
       reach a given character in a string.

       Setting the maximum depth to one disallows any nesting, so that ensures that the object is only a  single
       hash/object or array.

       If no argument is given, the highest possible setting will be used, which is rarely useful.

       See "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS" in JSON::XS for more info on why this is useful.

   <b>max_size</b>
           $json = $json-&gt;max_size([$maximum_string_size])

           $max_size = $json-&gt;get_max_size

       Set  the maximum length a JSON text may have (in bytes) where decoding is being attempted. The default is
       0, meaning no limit. When "decode" is called on a string that is longer then this many bytes, it will not
       attempt to decode the string but throw an exception. This setting has no effect on "encode" (yet).

       If no argument is given, the limit check will be deactivated (same as when 0 is specified).

       See "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS" in JSON::XS for more info on why this is useful.

   <b>encode</b>
           $json_text = $json-&gt;encode($perl_scalar)

       Converts the given Perl value or data structure to its JSON representation. Croaks on error.

   <b>decode</b>
           $perl_scalar = $json-&gt;decode($json_text)

       The opposite of "encode": expects a JSON text and tries to  parse  it,  returning  the  resulting  simple
       scalar or reference. Croaks on error.

   <b>decode_prefix</b>
           ($perl_scalar, $characters) = $json-&gt;decode_prefix($json_text)

       This  works  like the "decode" method, but instead of raising an exception when there is trailing garbage
       after the first JSON object, it will silently stop parsing there and  return  the  number  of  characters
       consumed so far.

       This  is  useful if your JSON texts are not delimited by an outer protocol and you need to know where the
       JSON text ends.

          JSON-&gt;new-&gt;decode_prefix ("[1] the tail")
          =&gt; ([1], 3)

</pre><h4><b>ADDITIONAL</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods are for this module only.

   <b>backend</b>
           $backend = $json-&gt;backend

       Since 2.92, "backend" method  returns  an  abstract  backend  module  used  currently,  which  should  be
       JSON::Backend::XS  (which  inherits  JSON::XS  or Cpanel::JSON::XS), or JSON::Backend::PP (which inherits
       JSON::PP), not to monkey-patch the actual backend module globally.

       If you need to know what is used actually, use "isa", instead of string comparison.

   <b>is_xs</b>
           $boolean = $json-&gt;is_xs

       Returns true if the backend inherits JSON::XS or Cpanel::JSON::XS.

   <b>is_pp</b>
           $boolean = $json-&gt;is_pp

       Returns true if the backend inherits JSON::PP.

   <b>property</b>
           $settings = $json-&gt;property()

       Returns a reference to a hash that holds all the common flag settings.

           $json = $json-&gt;property('utf8' =&gt; 1)
           $value = $json-&gt;property('utf8') # 1

       You can use this to get/set a value of a particular flag.

   <b>boolean</b>
           $boolean_object = JSON-&gt;boolean($scalar)

       Returns $JSON::true if $scalar contains a true value, $JSON::false otherwise.  You  can  use  this  as  a
       full-qualified function ("JSON::boolean($scalar)").

</pre><h4><b>INCREMENTAL</b> <b>PARSING</b></h4><pre>
       This section is also taken from JSON::XS.

       In  some  cases, there is the need for incremental parsing of JSON texts. While this module always has to
       keep both JSON text and resulting Perl data structure in memory at one time, it does allow you to parse a
       JSON stream incrementally. It does so by accumulating text until it has a full JSON object, which it then
       can decode. This process is similar to using "decode_prefix" to see if a full JSON object  is  available,
       but is much more efficient (and can be implemented with a minimum of method calls).

       This module will only attempt to parse the JSON text once it is sure it has enough text to get a decisive
       result,  using  a  very  simple  but truly incremental parser. This means that it sometimes won't stop as
       early as the full parser, for example, it doesn't  detect  mismatched  parentheses.  The  only  thing  it
       guarantees  is  that  it  starts  decoding as soon as a syntactically valid JSON text has been seen. This
       means you need to set resource limits (e.g. "max_size") to ensure the parser will  stop  parsing  in  the
       presence if syntax errors.

       The following methods implement this incremental parser.

   <b>incr_parse</b>
           $json-&gt;incr_parse( [$string] ) # void context

           $obj_or_undef = $json-&gt;incr_parse( [$string] ) # scalar context

           @obj_or_empty = $json-&gt;incr_parse( [$string] ) # list context

       This  is  the  central  parsing function. It can both append new text and extract objects from the stream
       accumulated so far (both of these functions are optional).

       If $string is given, then this string is appended to the already existing JSON  fragment  stored  in  the
       $json object.

       After  that,  if  the  function  is  called in void context, it will simply return without doing anything
       further. This can be used to add more text in as many chunks as you want.

       If the method is called in scalar context, then it will try to extract exactly <u>one</u> JSON object.  If  that
       is  successful,  it will return this object, otherwise it will return "undef". If there is a parse error,
       this method will croak just as "decode" would do (one can then use  "incr_skip"  to  skip  the  erroneous
       part). This is the most common way of using the method.

       And  finally,  in list context, it will try to extract as many objects from the stream as it can find and
       return them, or the empty list otherwise. For this to work, there  must  be  no  separators  (other  than
       whitespace)  between  the  JSON  objects or arrays, instead they must be concatenated back-to-back. If an
       error occurs, an exception will be raised as in the scalar context case. Note  that  in  this  case,  any
       previously-parsed JSON texts will be lost.

       Example: Parse some JSON arrays/objects in a given string and return them.

           my @objs = JSON-&gt;new-&gt;incr_parse ("[5][7][1,2]");

   <b>incr_text</b>
           $lvalue_string = $json-&gt;incr_text

       This method returns the currently stored JSON fragment as an lvalue, that is, you can manipulate it. This
       <u>only</u> works when a preceding call to "incr_parse" in <u>scalar</u> <u>context</u> successfully returned an object. Under
       all  other  circumstances  you must not call this function (I mean it.  although in simple tests it might
       actually work, it <u>will</u> fail under real world conditions). As a special exception, you can also call  this
       method before having parsed anything.

       That  means  you  can  only use this function to look at or manipulate text before or after complete JSON
       objects, not while the parser is in the middle of parsing a JSON object.

       This function is useful in two cases: a) finding the trailing text after a  JSON  object  or  b)  parsing
       multiple JSON objects separated by non-JSON text (such as commas).

   <b>incr_skip</b>
           $json-&gt;incr_skip

       This will reset the state of the incremental parser and will remove the parsed text from the input buffer
       so  far.  This  is  useful after "incr_parse" died, in which case the input buffer and incremental parser
       state is left unchanged, to skip the text parsed so far and to reset the parse state.

       The difference to "incr_reset" is that only text until the parse error occurred is removed.

   <b>incr_reset</b>
           $json-&gt;incr_reset

       This completely resets the incremental parser, that is, after this call, it will be as if the parser  had
       never parsed anything.

       This  is  useful if you want to repeatedly parse JSON objects and want to ignore any trailing data, which
       means you have to reset the parser after each successful decode.

</pre><h4><b>MAPPING</b></h4><pre>
       Most of this section is also taken from JSON::XS.

       This section describes how the backend modules map Perl values to  JSON  values  and  vice  versa.  These
       mappings  are  designed  to  "do  the right thing" in most circumstances automatically, preserving round-
       tripping characteristics (what you put in comes out as something equivalent).

       For the more enlightened: note that in the following descriptions, lowercase  <u>perl</u>  refers  to  the  Perl
       interpreter, while uppercase <u>Perl</u> refers to the abstract Perl language itself.

   <b>JSON</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>PERL</b>
       object
           A  JSON  object  becomes a reference to a hash in Perl. No ordering of object keys is preserved (JSON
           does not preserver object key ordering itself).

       array
           A JSON array becomes a reference to an array in Perl.

       string
           A JSON string becomes a string scalar in Perl - Unicode codepoints in JSON  are  represented  by  the
           same codepoints in the Perl string, so no manual decoding is necessary.

       number
           A JSON number becomes either an integer, numeric (floating point) or string scalar in perl, depending
           on  its  range  and  any fractional parts. On the Perl level, there is no difference between those as
           Perl handles all the conversion details, but an integer may  take  slightly  less  memory  and  might
           represent more values exactly than floating point numbers.

           If  the  number consists of digits only, this module will try to represent it as an integer value. If
           that fails, it will try to represent it as a numeric (floating  point)  value  if  that  is  possible
           without loss of precision. Otherwise it will preserve the number as a string value (in which case you
           lose roundtripping ability, as the JSON number will be re-encoded to a JSON string).

           Numbers  containing  a fractional or exponential part will always be represented as numeric (floating
           point) values, possibly at a loss of precision (in which case you might  lose  perfect  roundtripping
           ability, but the JSON number will still be re-encoded as a JSON number).

           Note  that  precision  is  not  accuracy - binary floating point values cannot represent most decimal
           fractions exactly, and when converting from and  to  floating  point,  this  module  only  guarantees
           precision up to but not including the least significant bit.

       true, false
           These  JSON  atoms  become  "JSON::true"  and "JSON::false", respectively. They are overloaded to act
           almost exactly like the numbers 1 and 0. You can check whether a scalar is a JSON  boolean  by  using
           the "JSON::is_bool" function.

       null
           A JSON null atom becomes "undef" in Perl.

       shell-style comments ("# <u>text</u>")
           As  a  nonstandard extension to the JSON syntax that is enabled by the "relaxed" setting, shell-style
           comments are allowed. They can start anywhere outside strings and go till the end of the line.

       tagged values ("(<u>tag</u>)<u>value</u>").
           Another nonstandard extension to the JSON syntax, enabled with the "allow_tags" setting,  are  tagged
           values.  In  this implementation, the <u>tag</u> must be a perl package/class name encoded as a JSON string,
           and the <u>value</u> must be a JSON array encoding optional constructor arguments.

           See "OBJECT SERIALISATION", below, for details.

   <b>PERL</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>JSON</b>
       The mapping from Perl to JSON is slightly more difficult, as Perl is a truly typeless language, so we can
       only guess which JSON type is meant by a Perl value.

       hash references
           Perl hash references become JSON objects. As there is no inherent ordering  in  hash  keys  (or  JSON
           objects),  they will usually be encoded in a pseudo-random order. This module can optionally sort the
           hash keys (determined by the <u>canonical</u> flag), so the same data structure will serialise to  the  same
           JSON  text  (given same settings and version of the same backend), but this incurs a runtime overhead
           and is only rarely useful, e.g. when you want to compare some JSON text against another for equality.

       array references
           Perl array references become JSON arrays.

       other references
           Other unblessed references are generally not allowed and will cause an exception to be thrown, except
           for references to the integers 0 and 1, which get turned into "false" and "true" atoms in  JSON.  You
           can also use "JSON::false" and "JSON::true" to improve readability.

              encode_json [\0,JSON::true]      # yields [false,true]

       JSON::true, JSON::false, JSON::null
           These  special values become JSON true and JSON false values, respectively. You can also use "\1" and
           "\0" directly if you want.

       blessed objects
           Blessed objects are not directly representable  in  JSON,  but  "JSON::XS"  allows  various  ways  of
           handling objects. See "OBJECT SERIALISATION", below, for details.

       simple scalars
           Simple  Perl  scalars  (any scalar that is not a reference) are the most difficult objects to encode:
           this module will encode undefined scalars as JSON "null" values, scalars that have last been used  in
           a string context before encoding as JSON strings, and anything else as number value:

              # dump as number
              encode_json [2]                      # yields [2]
              encode_json [-3.0e17]                # yields [-3e+17]
              my $value = 5; encode_json [$value]  # yields [5]

              # used as string, so dump as string
              print $value;
              encode_json [$value]                 # yields ["5"]

              # undef becomes null
              encode_json [undef]                  # yields [null]

           You can force the type to be a string by stringifying it:

              my $x = 3.1; # some variable containing a number
              "$x";        # stringified
              $x .= "";    # another, more awkward way to stringify
              print $x;    # perl does it for you, too, quite often

           You can force the type to be a number by numifying it:

              my $x = "3"; # some variable containing a string
              $x += 0;     # numify it, ensuring it will be dumped as a number
              $x *= 1;     # same thing, the choice is yours.

           You  can  not  currently  force  the  type  in  other,  less  obscure, ways. Tell me if you need this
           capability (but don't forget to explain why it's needed :).

           Since version 2.91_01, JSON::PP uses a different number detection logic that converts a  scalar  that
           is possible to turn into a number safely.  The new logic is slightly faster, and tends to help people
           who  use  older perl or who want to encode complicated data structure. However, this may results in a
           different JSON text from the one JSON::XS encodes (and thus may break tests that compare entire  JSON
           texts).  If  you  do  need  the  previous behavior for better compatibility or for finer control, set
           PERL_JSON_PP_USE_B environmental variable to true before you "use" JSON.

           Note that numerical precision has the same meaning as under Perl (so  binary  to  decimal  conversion
           follows  the same rules as in Perl, which can differ to other languages). Also, your perl interpreter
           might expose extensions to the floating point numbers of your platform, such as infinities or NaN's -
           these cannot be represented in JSON, and it is an error to pass those in.

           JSON.pm backend modules trust what you pass to "encode"  method  (or  "encode_json"  function)  is  a
           clean,  validated  data  structure  with  values  that  can be represented as valid JSON values only,
           because it's not from an external data source (as opposed to JSON  texts  you  pass  to  "decode"  or
           "decode_json",  which  JSON  backends  consider tainted and don't trust). As JSON backends don't know
           exactly what you and consumers of your JSON texts want the unexpected values to be (you may  want  to
           convert  them into null, or to stringify them with or without normalisation (string representation of
           infinities/NaN may vary depending on platforms), or to croak without conversion), you're  advised  to
           do  what  you and your consumers need before you encode, and also not to numify values that may start
           with values that look like a number (including infinities/NaN), without validating.

   <b>OBJECT</b> <b>SERIALISATION</b>
       As JSON cannot directly represent Perl objects, you have to choose between  a  pure  JSON  representation
       (without  the  ability to deserialise the object automatically again), and a nonstandard extension to the
       JSON syntax, tagged values.

       <u>SERIALISATION</u>

       What happens when this module encounters a Perl object depends on the "allow_blessed",  "convert_blessed"
       and "allow_tags" settings, which are used in this order:

       1. "allow_tags" is enabled and the object has a "FREEZE" method.
           In this case, "JSON" creates a tagged JSON value, using a nonstandard extension to the JSON syntax.

           This works by invoking the "FREEZE" method on the object, with the first argument being the object to
           serialise,  and  the  second  argument  being the constant string "JSON" to distinguish it from other
           serialisers.

           The "FREEZE" method can return any number of values  (i.e.  zero  or  more).  These  values  and  the
           package/classname of the object will then be encoded as a tagged JSON value in the following format:

              ("classname")[FREEZE return values...]

           e.g.:

              ("URI")["<a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>"]
              ("MyDate")[2013,10,29]
              ("ImageData::JPEG")["Z3...VlCg=="]

           For  example,  the  hypothetical  "My::Object"  "FREEZE" method might use the objects "type" and "id"
           members to encode the object:

              sub My::Object::FREEZE {
                 my ($self, $serialiser) = @_;

                 ($self-&gt;{type}, $self-&gt;{id})
              }

       2. "convert_blessed" is enabled and the object has a "TO_JSON" method.
           In this case, the "TO_JSON" method of the object is invoked in  scalar  context.  It  must  return  a
           single  scalar  that  can  be directly encoded into JSON. This scalar replaces the object in the JSON
           text.

           For example, the following "TO_JSON" method will  convert  all  URI  objects  to  JSON  strings  when
           serialised. The fact that these values originally were URI objects is lost.

              sub URI::TO_JSON {
                 my ($uri) = @_;
                 $uri-&gt;as_string
              }

       3. "allow_blessed" is enabled.
           The object will be serialised as a JSON null value.

       4. none of the above
           If  none  of  the  settings  are enabled or the respective methods are missing, this module throws an
           exception.

       <u>DESERIALISATION</u>

       For deserialisation there are only two cases to consider: either nonstandard tagging was used,  in  which
       case  "allow_tags" decides, or objects cannot be automatically be deserialised, in which case you can use
       postprocessing or the "filter_json_object" or "filter_json_single_key_object" callbacks to get some  real
       objects our of your JSON.

       This  section  only  considers the tagged value case: a tagged JSON object is encountered during decoding
       and "allow_tags" is disabled, a parse error will result (as  if  tagged  values  were  not  part  of  the
       grammar).

       If  "allow_tags"  is  enabled,  this  module will look up the "THAW" method of the package/classname used
       during serialisation (it will not attempt to load the package as a Perl module).  If  there  is  no  such
       method, the decoding will fail with an error.

       Otherwise,  the "THAW" method is invoked with the classname as first argument, the constant string "JSON"
       as second argument, and all the values from the  JSON  array  (the  values  originally  returned  by  the
       "FREEZE" method) as remaining arguments.

       The  method must then return the object. While technically you can return any Perl scalar, you might have
       to enable the "allow_nonref" setting to make that work in all cases, so better return an  actual  blessed
       reference.

       As  an  example,  let's  implement  a "THAW" function that regenerates the "My::Object" from the "FREEZE"
       example earlier:

          sub My::Object::THAW {
             my ($class, $serialiser, $type, $id) = @_;

             $class-&gt;new (type =&gt; $type, id =&gt; $id)
          }

</pre><h4><b>ENCODING/CODESET</b> <b>FLAG</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This section is taken from JSON::XS.

       The interested reader might have seen a number of flags that signify  encodings  or  codesets  -  "utf8",
       "latin1" and "ascii". There seems to be some confusion on what these do, so here is a short comparison:

       "utf8"  controls whether the JSON text created by "encode" (and expected by "decode") is UTF-8 encoded or
       not, while "latin1" and "ascii" only control whether "encode"  escapes  character  values  outside  their
       respective  codeset  range.  Neither  of these flags conflict with each other, although some combinations
       make less sense than others.

       Care has been taken to make all flags symmetrical with respect to "encode" and "decode", that  is,  texts
       encoded  with any combination of these flag values will be correctly decoded when the same flags are used
       - in general, if you use different flag settings while encoding vs. when decoding you likely have  a  bug
       somewhere.

       Below  comes  a  verbose  discussion  of  these flags. Note that a "codeset" is simply an abstract set of
       character-codepoint pairs, while an encoding takes those codepoint numbers and <u>encodes</u> them, in our  case
       into  octets. Unicode is (among other things) a codeset, UTF-8 is an encoding, and ISO-8859-1 (= latin 1)
       and ASCII are both codesets <u>and</u> encodings at the same time, which can be confusing.

       "utf8" flag disabled
           When "utf8" is disabled (the default), then "encode"/"decode" generate and  expect  Unicode  strings,
           that  is, characters with high ordinal Unicode values (&gt; 255) will be encoded as such characters, and
           likewise  such  characters  are  decoded  as-is,  no  changes  to   them   will   be   done,   except
           "(re-)interpreting"  them  as  Unicode codepoints or Unicode characters, respectively (to Perl, these
           are the same thing in strings unless you do funny/weird/dumb stuff).

           This is useful when you want to do the encoding yourself (e.g. when you want to have  UTF-16  encoded
           JSON  texts)  or  when  some  other  layer does the encoding for you (for example, when printing to a
           terminal using a filehandle that transparently encodes to UTF-8 you certainly do NOT  want  to  UTF-8
           encode your data first and have Perl encode it another time).

       "utf8" flag enabled
           If  the  "utf8"-flag is enabled, "encode"/"decode" will encode all characters using the corresponding
           UTF-8 multi-byte sequence, and will expect your input strings to be encoded as  UTF-8,  that  is,  no
           "character" of the input string must have any value &gt; 255, as UTF-8 does not allow that.

           The "utf8" flag therefore switches between two modes: disabled means you will get a Unicode string in
           Perl, enabled means you get an UTF-8 encoded octet/binary string in Perl.

       "latin1" or "ascii" flags enabled
           With  "latin1" (or "ascii") enabled, "encode" will escape characters with ordinal values &gt; 255 (&gt; 127
           with "ascii") and encode the remaining characters as specified by the "utf8" flag.

           If "utf8" is disabled, then the result is also correctly encoded in those character sets (as both are
           proper subsets of Unicode, meaning that a Unicode string with all character values &lt; 256 is the  same
           thing  as a ISO-8859-1 string, and a Unicode string with all character values &lt; 128 is the same thing
           as an ASCII string in Perl).

           If "utf8" is enabled, you still get a correct UTF-8-encoded string, regardless of these  flags,  just
           some more characters will be escaped using "\uXXXX" then before.

           Note  that  ISO-8859-1-<u>encoded</u>  strings  are  not compatible with UTF-8 encoding, while ASCII-encoded
           strings are. That is because the ISO-8859-1 encoding is NOT a subset of UTF-8 (despite the ISO-8859-1
           <u>codeset</u> being a subset of Unicode), while ASCII is.

           Surprisingly, "decode" will ignore these flags and so treat all  input  values  as  governed  by  the
           "utf8"  flag.  If it is disabled, this allows you to decode ISO-8859-1- and ASCII-encoded strings, as
           both strict subsets of Unicode. If it is enabled, you can correctly decode UTF-8 encoded strings.

           So neither "latin1" nor "ascii" are incompatible with the "utf8" flag - they  only  govern  when  the
           JSON output engine escapes a character or not.

           The  main  use for "latin1" is to relatively efficiently store binary data as JSON, at the expense of
           breaking compatibility with most JSON decoders.

           The main use for "ascii" is to force the output to not contain characters with values  &gt;  127,  which
           means  you  can  interpret the resulting string as UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, ASCII, KOI8-R or most about any
           character set and 8-bit-encoding, and still get the same data structure back.  This  is  useful  when
           your  channel  for JSON transfer is not 8-bit clean or the encoding might be mangled in between (e.g.
           in mail), and works because ASCII is a proper subset of most 8-bit and multibyte encodings in use  in
           the world.

</pre><h4><b>BACKWARD</b> <b>INCOMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Since  version  2.90,  stringification (and string comparison) for "JSON::true" and "JSON::false" has not
       been overloaded. It shouldn't matter as long as you treat them as boolean values, but a code that expects
       they are stringified as "true" or "false" doesn't work as you have expected any more.

           if (JSON::true eq 'true') {  # now fails

           print "The result is $JSON::true now."; # =&gt; The result is 1 now.

       And now these boolean values don't inherit JSON::Boolean, either.  When you need to test  a  value  is  a
       JSON  boolean  value  or  not,  use  "JSON::is_bool"  function,  instead  of testing the value inherits a
       particular boolean class or not.
