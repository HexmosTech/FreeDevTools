</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Data::JavaScript::Anon - Dump big dumb Perl structs to anonymous JavaScript structs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # Dump an arbitrary structure to javascript
         Data::JavaScript::Anon-&gt;anon_dump( [ 'a', 'b', { a =&gt; 1, b =&gt; 2 } ] );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Data::JavaScript::Anon provides the ability to dump large simple data structures to JavaScript. That is,
       things that don't need to be a class, or have special methods or whatever.

       The method it uses is to write anonymous variables, in the same way you would in Perl. The following
       shows some examples.

         # Perl anonymous array
         [ 1, 'a', 'Foo Bar' ]

         # JavaScript equivalent ( yes, it's exactly the same )
         [ 1, 'a', 'Foo Bar' ]

         # Perl anonymous hash
         { foo =&gt; 1, bar =&gt; 'bar' }

         # JavaScript equivalent
         { foo: 1, bar: 'bar' }

       One advantage of doing it in this method is that you do not have to co-ordinate variable names between
       your HTML templates and Perl. You could use a simple Template Toolkit phrase like the following to get
       data into your HTML templates.

         var javascript_data = [% data %];

       In this way, it doesn't matter WHAT the HTML template calls a particular variables, the data dumps just
       the same. This could help you keep the work of JavaScript and Perl programmers ( assuming you were using
       different people ) seperate, without creating cross-dependencies between their code, such as variable
       names.

       The variables you dump can also be of arbitrary depth and complexity, with a few limitations.

       ARRAY and HASH only
           Since  arrays and hashs are all that is supported by JavaScript, they are the only things you can use
           in your structs. Any references or a  different  underlying  type  will  be  detected  and  an  error
           returned.

           Note  that  Data::JavaScript::Anon  will  use  the  UNDERLYING  type of the data. This means that the
           blessed classes or objects  will  be  ignored  and  their  data  based  on  the  object's  underlying
           implementation type.

           This  can  be  a positive thing, as you can put objects for which you expect a certain dump structure
           into the data to dump, and it will convert to unblessed, more stupid, JavaScript objects cleanly.

       No Circular References
           Since circular references can't be defined in a single anonymous struct, they are  not  allowed.  Try
           something like Data::JavaScript instead.  Although not supported, they will be detected, and an error
           returned.

</pre><h4><b>MAIN</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       All methods are called as methods directly, in the form "Data::JavaScript::Anon-&gt;anon_dump( [ 'etc' ] )".

   <b>anon_dump</b> <b>STRUCT</b>
       The  main  method  of  the class, anon_dump takes a single arbitrary data struct, and converts it into an
       anonymous JavaScript struct.

       If needed, the argument can even be a normal text string, although it wouldn't do a lot to it. :)

       Returns a string containing the JavaScript struct on success, or "undef" if an error is found.

   <b>var_dump</b> <b>$name,</b> <b>STRUCT</b>
       As above, but the "var_dump" method allows you to specify a variable name, with the resulting  JavaScript
       being "var name = struct;". Note that the method WILL put the trailing semi-colon on the string.

   <b>script_wrap</b> <b>$javascript</b>
       The "script_wrap" method is a quick way of wrapping a normal JavaScript html tag around your JavaScript.

   <b>is_a_number</b> <b>$scalar</b>
       When generating the javascript, numbers will be printed directly and not quoted. The "is_a_number" method
       provides  convenient  access  to  the test that is used to see if something is a number. The test handles
       just about everything legal in JavaScript, with the one exception  of  the  exotics,  such  as  Infinite,
       -Infinit and NaN.

       Returns true is a scalar is numeric, or false otherwise.

       You may also access method in using an instantiated object.

   <b>new</b> <b>HASH</b>
       This  will  create  a  Data::JavaScript::Anon  object  that  will allow you to change some of the default
       behaviors of some methods.

           Options:
               quote_char  : Set the quote_char for stirng scalars. Default is '"'.

</pre><h4><b>SECONDARY</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following are a little less general, but may be of some use.

   <b>var_scalar</b> <b>$name,</b> <b>\$scalar</b>
       Creates a named variable from a scalar reference.

   <b>var_array</b> <b>$name,</b> <b>\@array</b>
       Creates a named variable from an array reference.

   <b>var_hash</b> <b>$name,</b> <b>\%hash</b>
       Creates a named variable from a hash reference.

   <b>anon_scalar</b> <b>\$scalar</b>
       Creates an anonymous JavaScript value from a scalar reference.

   <b>anon_array</b> <b>\@array</b>
       Creates an anonymous JavaScript array from an array reference.

   <b>anon_hash</b> <b>\%hash</b>
       Creates an anonymous JavaScript object from a hash reference.

   <b>anon_hash_key</b> <b>$value</b>
       Applys the formatting for a key in a JavaScript object
