</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       JavaScript::Minifier::XS - XS based JavaScript minifier

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use JavaScript::Minifier::XS <a href="../manminify/qw.minify.html">qw</a>(minify);
         my $js       = '...';
         my $minified = minify($js);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "JavaScript::Minifier::XS" is a JavaScript "minifier"; its designed to remove unnecessary whitespace and
       comments from JavaScript files, which also <b>not</b> breaking the JavaScript.

       "JavaScript::Minifier::XS" is similar in function to "JavaScript::Minifier", but is substantially faster
       as its written in XS and not just pure Perl.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       minify($js)
           Minifies the given $js, returning the minified JavaScript back to the caller.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>IT</b> <b>WORKS</b></h4><pre>
       "JavaScript::Minifier::XS"  minifies  the  JavaScript  by removing unnecessary whitespace from JavaScript
       documents.  Comments (both block and line) are also removed,  <u>except</u>  when  (a)  they  contain  the  word
       "copyright" in them, or (b) they're needed to implement "IE Conditional Compilation".

       Internally, the minification process is done by taking multiple passes through the JavaScript document:

   <b>Pass</b> <b>1:</b> <b>Tokenize</b>
       First,  we  go  through  and  parse  the  JavaScript  document  into  a series of tokens internally.  The
       tokenizing process <b>does</b> <b>not</b> check to make sure you've got syntactically valid JavaScript, it just  breaks
       up the text into a stream of tokens suitable for processing by the subsequent stages.

   <b>Pass</b> <b>2:</b> <b>Collapse</b>
       We  then  march  through  the  token  list  and  collapse  certain tokens down to their smallest possible
       representation.  <u>If</u> they're still included in the final results we only want to  include  them  at  their
       shortest.

       Whitespace
           Runs  of  multiple  whitespace  characters are reduced down to a single whitespace character.  If the
           whitespace contains any "end of line" (EOL)  characters,  then  the  end  result  is  the  <u>first</u>  EOL
           character encountered.  Otherwise, the result is the first whitespace character in the run.

   <b>Pass</b> <b>3:</b> <b>Pruning</b>
       We then go back through the token list and prune and remove unnecessary tokens.

       Whitespace
           Wherever  possible,  whitespace  is  removed;  before+after  comment blocks, and before+after various
           symbols/sigils.

       Comments
           Comments that are either (a) IE conditional compilation  comments,  or  that  (b)  contain  the  word
           "copyright" in them are preserved.  <b>All</b> other comments (line and block) are removed.

       Everything else
           We keep everything else; identifiers, quoted literal strings, symbols/sigils, etc.

   <b>Pass</b> <b>4:</b> <b>Re-assembly</b>
       Lastly,  we  go  back through the token list and re-assemble it all back into a single JavaScript string,
       which is then returned back to the caller.
