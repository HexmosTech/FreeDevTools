</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       NGPICT - Effects a break in the picture drawing sequence in a FORTRAN code using GKS.  The actions taken
       depend on whether the designated workstation is a metafile or an output/input workstation.  An option is
       provided for prompting the user when an output/input workstation is ready and waiting after a pause.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL NGPICT(WKID,ACTION)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_ngpict(int wkid, int action)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       WKID        (an  input  parameter  of  type  INTEGER)  which  designates  the workstation identifier of a
                   workstation as it was specified in a GOPWK call.

       ACTION      (an input parameter of type INTEGER) the value of which specifies the action to be  taken  on
                   the workstation WKID.  Legal values are:

                   0      Execute an UPDATE WORKSTATION on WKID.

                   1      Execute an UPDATE WORKSTATION followed by a CLEAR WORKSTATION.

                   2      Execute  an  UPDATE WORKSTATION followed by a pause waiting for a mouse click or a key
                          click.

                   3      Execute an UPDATE WORKSTATION followed by a pause  followed  by  a  CLEAR  WORKSTATION
                          after the pause has been terminated by a mouse click or a key click.

                   4      Same  as  3 except a "&lt;READY&gt;" prompt is issued in the lower left corner of the window
                          after the UPDATE WORKSTATION.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       If WKID designates a metafile, then a CLEAR WORKSTATION is done which inserts an  END  PICTURE  into  the
       metafile.   The  result  produced  in this case would be the same as that resulting from a call to FRAME.
       The only valid actions for a metafile workstation are 0 and 1.

       NGPICT is designed to be used when more precise control over individual workstations is desired than that
       offered by FRAME.  This might be desirable, for example,  when  an  application  is  controlling  several
       simultaneously  active  workstations.   To  use  NGPICT one should be opening GKS workstations with GOPWK
       rather than with OPNGKS.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       If WKID=2 designates a metafile workstation, then

               CALL NGPICT(2,1)

       would duplicate the action of a FRAME call.

       If WKID=2 designates an X11 workstation, then

               CALL NGPICT(2,4)

       would cause a pause in the X11 window and wait for a key click or a mouse  click.   A  "&lt;READY&gt;"  prompt,
       indicating  that  the window is waiting for a mouse click or a key click,  would appear at the lower left
       of the X11 window after the window has been updated.  After a mouse click in the X11 window, that  window
       will be cleared before program execution continues.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use NGPICT or c_ngpict, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       Non-fatal errors are reported for values of ACTION out of range and for values of ACTION  inappropriately
       applied to a metafile.  Also, a non-fatal error is reported if NGPICT is called while a segment is open.
