       gopwk - opens a GKS workstation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL GOPWK (WKID, CONID, WKTYPE)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/gks.h&gt;

       void gopen_ws(Gint ws_id, const char *conn_id, Gint ws_type);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       WKID        (Integer,  Input) - A number assigned to a workstation as an identifier that is to be used in
                   all subsequent calls to GKS functions that require a workstation identifier.   In  NCAR  GKS,
                   WKID can be any non-negative integer.

       CONID       (Integer,  Input)  -  A  connection  identifier  that  has  different  meanings for different
                   workstation types (see the USAGE section below).

       WKTYPE      (Integer, Input) - An identifier specifying the specific  type  of  output  device  targeted.
                   Each  GKS  package  has an implementation-dependent set of workstation types that the package
                   supports.  The legal workstation types in NCAR GKS are:

                    1    -  NCGM

                    3    -  WISS

                    7    -  pre-existing X11 window.

                    8    -  non-existing X11 window.

                   10    -  text dump of graphics output.

                   11    -  PDF in portrait mode.

                   12    -  PDF in landscape mode.

                   20    -  color PostScript in portrait mode.

                   21    -  color Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) in portrait mode.

                   22    -  color Encapsulated PostScript Interchange format (EPSI) in portrait mode.

                   23    -  monochrome PostScript in portrait mode.

                   24    -  monochrome Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) in portrait mode.

                   25    -  monochrome Encapsulated PostScript Interchange format (EPSI) in portrait mode.

                   26    -  color PostScript in landscape mode.

                   27    -  color Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) in landscape mode.

                   28    -  color Encapsulated PostScript Interchange format (EPSI) in landscape mode.

                   29    -  monochrome PostScript in landscape mode.

                   30    -  monochrome Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) in landscape mode.

                   31    -  monochrome Encapsulated PostScript Interchange format (EPSI) in landscape mode.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       For workstation types of 1 (CGM) or 3 (WISS) the connection ID is used as a Fortran logical unit  number.
       One  can  have  at most one workstation of type 1 open at a time and this also applies to workstations of
       type 3.  One can have workstations of types 1 and 3 open  simultaneously  and  they  must  have  distinct
       connection IDs.  To use the GFLASH package or any GKS segmentation functions WISS must be opened first.

       For  workstations of type 7 the connection ID is the X11 window ID for the existing window (obtained from
       xwininfo for example).

       For workstations of type 8 an X11 window will be created at open workstation time.  The connection ID  is
       irrelevant for workstations of type 8.

       For  workstations  of  type  10,  the  ASCII  text is written to standard output and the connection ID is
       irrelevant.

       There can be a maximum of fifteen simultaneously open workstations of all types.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use GKS routines, load the NCAR GKS-0A library ncarg_gks.
