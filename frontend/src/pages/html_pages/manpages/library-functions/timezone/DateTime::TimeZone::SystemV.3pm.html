</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An instance of this class represents a timezone that was specified by means of a System V timezone recipe
       or an extended form of the same syntax (such as that specified by POSIX).  These can express a plain
       offset from Universal Time, or a system of two offsets (standard and daylight saving time) switching on a
       yearly cycle according to certain types of rule.

       This class implements the DateTime::TimeZone interface, so that its instances can be used with DateTime
       objects.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>V</b> <b>TIMEZONE</b> <b>RECIPE</b> <b>SYSTEM</b></h4><pre>
       This module supports multiple versions of the timezone recipe syntax derived from System V.
       Specifically, it supports the version specified by POSIX.1, and the extension of the POSIX format that is
       used by version 3 of the <b><a href="../man5/tzfile.5.html">tzfile</a></b>(5) file format.

       A timezone may be specified that has a fixed offset by the syntax "<u>aaaooo</u>", or a timezone with DST by the
       syntax "<u>aaaoooaaa</u>[<u>ooo</u>]<b>,</b><u>rrr</u><b>,</b><u>rrr</u>".  "<u>aaa</u>" specifies an abbreviation by which an offset is known, "<u>ooo</u>"
       specifies the offset, and "<u>rrr</u>" is a rule for when DST starts or ends.  For backward compatibility, the
       rules part may also be omitted from a DST-using timezone, in which case some built-in default rules are
       used; don't rely on those rules being useful.

       An abbreviation must be a string of three or more characters from ASCII alphanumerics, "<b>+</b>", and "<b>-</b>".  If
       it contains only ASCII alphabetic characters then the abbreviation specification "<u>aaa</u>" may be simply the
       abbreviation.  Otherwise "<u>aaa</u>" must consist of the abbreviation wrapped in angle brackets ("<b>&lt;</b>...<b>&gt;</b>").  The
       angle bracket form is always allowed.  POSIX allows an implementation to set an upper limit on the length
       of timezone abbreviations.  The limit is known as "TZNAME_MAX", and is required to be no less than 6
       (characters/bytes).  Abbreviations longer than 6 characters are therefore not portable.  This class
       imposes no such limit.

       An offset (from Universal Time), "<u>ooo</u>", is given in hours, or hours and minutes, or hours and minutes and
       seconds, with an optional preceding sign.  Hours, minutes, and seconds must be separated by colons.  The
       hours may be one or two digits, and the minutes and seconds must be two digits each.  The maximum
       magnitude permitted is 24:59:59.  The sign in the specification is the opposite of the sign of the actual
       offset.  If no sign is given then the default is "<b>+</b>", meaning a timezone that is behind UT (or equal to
       UT if the offset is zero).  If no DST offset is specified, it defaults to one hour ahead of the standard
       offset.

       A DST-using timezone has one transition to DST and one transition to standard time in each Gregorian
       year.  The transitions may be in either order within the year.  If the transitions are in different
       orders from year to year then the behaviour is undefined; don't rely on it remaining the same in future
       versions.  Likewise, the behaviour is generally undefined if transitions coincide.  However, in the
       <b><a href="../man5/tzfile.5.html">tzfile</a></b>(5) variant, if the rules specify a transition to DST at 00:00 standard time on 1 January and a
       transition to standard time at 24:00 standard time on 31 December, which makes the transitions coincide
       with those of adjacent years, then the timezone is treated as observing DST all year.

       A transition rule "<u>rrr</u>" takes the form "<u>ddd</u>[<b>/</b><u>ttt</u>]", where "<u>ddd</u>" is the rule giving the day on which the
       transition notionally takes place and "<u>ttt</u>" is the time of day at which the transition takes place.  (A
       time of day outside the usual 24-hour range can make the transition actually take place on a different
       day.)  The time may be given in hours, or hours and minutes, or hours and minutes and seconds.  Hours,
       minutes, and seconds must be separated by colons.  The minutes and seconds must be two digits each.  In
       the POSIX variant, the hours may be one or two digits, with no preceding sign, and the time stated may
       range from 00:00:00 to 24:59:59 (almost an hour into the following day).  In the <b><a href="../man5/tzfile.5.html">tzfile</a></b>(5) variant, the
       hours may be one to three digits, with optional preceding sign, and the time stated may range from
       -167:59:59 to +167:59:59 (a span of a little over two weeks).  If the time is not stated then it defaults
       to 02:00:00.  The time for the transition to DST is interpreted according to the standard offset, and the
       time for the transition to standard time is interpreted according to the DST offset.  (Thus normally the
       transition time is interpreted according to the offset that prevailed immediately before the transition.)

       A day rule "<u>ddd</u>" may take three forms.  Firstly, "<b>J</b><u>nnn</u>" means the month-day date that is the <u>nnn</u>th day of
       a non-leap year.  Thus "<b>J59</b>" means the February 28 and "<b>J60</b>" means March 1 (even in a leap year).
       February 29 cannot be specified this way.

       Secondly, if "<u>ddd</u>" is just a decimal number, it means the (1+<u>ddd</u>)th day of the year.  February 29 counts
       in this case, and it is not possible to specify December 31 of a leap year.

       Thirdly, "<u>ddd</u>" may have the form "<b>M</b><u>m</u><b>.</b><u>w</u><b>.</b><u>d</u>" means day <u>d</u> of the <u>w</u>th week of the <u>m</u>th month.  The day is given
       as a single digit, with "<b>0</b>" meaning Sunday and "<b>6</b>" meaning Saturday.  The first week contains days 1 to 7
       of the month, the second week contains days 8 to 14, and so on.  If "<u>w</u>" is "<b>5</b>" then the last week of the
       month (containing its last seven days) is used, rather than the fifth week (which is incomplete).

       Examples:

       MUT-4
           Mauritius time, since 1907: 4 hours ahead of UT all year.

       EST5EDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0
           US  Eastern  timezone with DST, from 2007 onwards.  5 hours behind UT in winter and 4 hours behind in
           summer.  Changes on the second Sunday in March and the first Sunday in  November,  in  each  case  at
           02:00 local time.

       NST3:30NDT,M3.2.0/0:01,M11.1.0/0:01
           Newfoundland  timezone  with  DST,  from  2007  onwards.  3.5 hours behind UT in winter and 2.5 hours
           behind in summer.  Changes on the second Sunday in March and the first Sunday in  November,  in  each
           case at 00:01 local time.

       GMT0BST,M3.5.0/1,M10.5.0
           UK  civil time, from 1996 onwards.  On UT during the winter, calling it "GMT", and 1 hour ahead of UT
           during the summer, called "BST".  Changes on the last Sunday in March and the last Sunday in October,
           in each case at 01:00 UT.

       EST-10EST,M10.5.0,M3.5.0/3
           Australian Eastern timezone, from 2007 onwards.  10 hours ahead of UT in  the  southern  winter  (the
           middle  of the calendar year), and 11 hours ahead in the southern summer.  Changes to DST on the last
           Sunday in October, and back on the last Sunday in March, in each case at 02:00 standard  time  (16:00
           UT of the preceding day).

       EET-2EEST,M3.5.4/24,M9.3.6/145
           Palestinian  civil  time,  from  2012  onwards.   2  hours ahead of UT in winter and 3 hours ahead in
           summer.  Changes at the end (24:00 local time) of the last Thursday in March and 01:00 local time  on
           the  Friday  following the third Saturday in September (that is, the Friday falling between September
           21 and September 27 inclusive).  The extended time-of-day "145", meaning 01:00 of the  day  six  days
           after  the  nominal day, is only valid in the <b><a href="../man5/tzfile.5.html">tzfile</a></b>(5) variant of the System V syntax.  The time-of-
           day "24" is not so restricted, being permitted by POSIX.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       DateTime::TimeZone::SystemV-&gt;new(ATTR =&gt; VALUE, ...)
           Constructs and returns a DateTime-compatible timezone object that implements the  timezone  described
           by the recipe given in the arguments.  The following attributes may be given:

           <b>name</b>
               Name  for  the  timezone object.  This will be returned by the "name" method described below, and
               will be included in certain error messages.  If not  given,  then  the  recipe  is  used  as  the
               timezone name.

           <b>recipe</b>
               The  short  textual  timezone recipe, as described in "SYSTEM V TIMEZONE RECIPE SYSTEM".  Must be
               given.

           <b>system</b>
               Keyword identifying the particular variant of the recipe system according to which the recipe  is
               to be interpreted.  It may be:

               <b>posix</b> (default)
                   As specified by POSIX.1.

               <b>tzfile3</b>
                   As specified by version 3 of the <b><a href="../man5/tzfile.5.html">tzfile</a></b>(5) file format.

       DateTime::TimeZone::SystemV-&gt;new(RECIPE)
           Simpler  way to invoke the above constructor in the usual case.  Only the recipe is given; it will be
           interpreted according to POSIX system, and the recipe will also be used as the timezone name.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       These methods are all part of the DateTime::TimeZone interface.  See that class for the  general  meaning
       of these methods; the documentation below only comments on the specific behaviour of this class.

   <b>Identification</b>
       $tz-&gt;is_floating
           Returns false.

       $tz-&gt;is_utc
           Returns false.

       $tz-&gt;is_olson
           Returns false.

       $tz-&gt;category
           Returns "undef", because the category concept doesn't properly apply to these timezones.

       $tz-&gt;name
           Returns  the  timezone name.  Usually this is the recipe that was supplied to the constructor, but it
           can be overridden by the constructor's <b>name</b> attribute.

   <b>Offsets</b>
       $tz-&gt;has_dst_changes
           Returns a truth value indicating whether the timezone includes a DST offset.

       $tz-&gt;is_dst_for_datetime(DT)
           <u>DT</u> must be a DateTime-compatible object (specifically, it must implement the "utc_rd_values" method).
           Returns a truth value indicating whether the timezone is on DST at the instant represented by <u>DT</u>.

       $tz-&gt;offset_for_datetime(DT)
           <u>DT</u> must be a DateTime-compatible object (specifically, it must implement the "utc_rd_values" method).
           Returns the offset from UT that is in effect at the instant represented by <u>DT</u>, in seconds.

       $tz-&gt;short_name_for_datetime(DT)
           <u>DT</u> must be a DateTime-compatible object (specifically, it must implement the "utc_rd_values" method).
           Returns the time scale abbreviation for the offset that is in effect at the  instant  represented  by
           <u>DT</u>.

       $tz-&gt;offset_for_local_datetime(DT)
           <u>DT</u>  must  be  a  DateTime-compatible  object  (specifically,  it must implement the "local_rd_values"
           method).  Takes the local  time  represented  by  <u>DT</u>  (regardless  of  what  absolute  time  it  also
           represents),  and  interprets  that  as  a local time in the timezone of the timezone object (not the
           timezone used in <u>DT</u>).  Returns the offset from UT that is in effect at that local time, in seconds.

           If the local time given is ambiguous due to a nearby offset  change,  the  numerically  lower  offset
           (usually  the  standard  one)  is returned with no warning of the situation.  If the local time given
           does not exist due to a nearby offset change, the method "die"s saying so.
