       See the <b>options</b> manual entry for details on the standard options.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-activerelief</b>
       Database Name:  <b>activeRelief</b>
       Database Class: <b>ActiveRelief</b>

              Specifies  the  relief  to use when displaying the element that is active, if any.  Elements other
              than the active element are always displayed with a raised relief.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-command</b>
       Database Name:  <b>command</b>
       Database Class: <b>Command</b>

              Specifies the prefix of a Tcl command to invoke to change the view in the widget  associated  with
              the scrollbar.  When a user requests a view change by manipulating the scrollbar, a Tcl command is
              invoked.   The  actual  command  consists  of  this  option  followed by additional information as
              described later.  This option almost always has a value such as <b>.t</b> <b>xview</b> or <b>.t</b>  <b>yview</b>,  consisting
              of  the  name of a widget and either <b>xview</b> (if the scrollbar is for horizontal scrolling) or <b>yview</b>
              (for vertical scrolling).  All scrollable widgets have <b>xview</b> and <b>yview</b> commands that take  exactly
              the additional arguments appended by the scrollbar as described in <b>SCROLLING</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> below.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-elementborderwidth</b>
       Database Name:  <b>elementBorderWidth</b>
       Database Class: <b>BorderWidth</b>

              Specifies the width of borders drawn around the internal elements of the scrollbar (the two arrows
              and  the  slider).  The value may have any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  If this value
              is the empty string (the default), the value of the <b>-borderwidth</b> option is used in its place.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-width</b>
       Database Name:  <b>width</b>
       Database Class: <b>Width</b>

              Specifies the desired narrow dimension of the scrollbar window, not including 3-D border, if  any.
              For  vertical  scrollbars  this  will  be the width and for horizontal scrollbars this will be the
              height.  The value may have any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>scrollbar</b> command creates a new window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument) and makes it into a scrollbar
       widget.  Additional options, described above, may be specified on the  command  line  or  in  the  option
       database  to  configure  aspects  of  the  scrollbar  such  as  its colors, orientation, and relief.  The
       <b>scrollbar</b> command returns its <u>pathName</u> argument.  At the time this command is  invoked,  there  must  not
       exist a window named <u>pathName</u>, but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.

       A  scrollbar  is a widget that displays two arrows, one at each end of the scrollbar, and a <u>slider</u> in the
       middle portion of the scrollbar.  It provides information about what is visible in an  <u>associated</u>  <u>window</u>
       that  displays a document of some sort (such as a file being edited or a drawing).  The position and size
       of the slider indicate which portion of the document is visible in the associated window.   For  example,
       if  the  slider in a vertical scrollbar covers the top third of the area between the two arrows, it means
       that the associated window displays the top third of its document.

       Scrollbars can be used to adjust the view in the associated window  by  clicking  or  dragging  with  the
       mouse.  See the <b>BINDINGS</b> section below for details.

</pre><h4><b>ELEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       A scrollbar displays five elements, which are referred to in the widget commands for the scrollbar:

       <b>arrow1</b>    The top or left arrow in the scrollbar.

       <b>trough1</b>   The region between the slider and <b>arrow1</b>.

       <b>slider</b>    The rectangle that indicates what is visible in the associated widget.

       <b>trough2</b>   The region between the slider and <b>arrow2</b>.

       <b>arrow2</b>    The bottom or right arrow in the scrollbar.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>scrollbar</b>  command  creates  a  new Tcl command whose name is <u>pathName</u>.  This command may be used to
       invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>Option</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following commands are possible for
       scrollbar widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>activate</b> ?<u>element</u>?
              Marks the element indicated by <u>element</u> as active, which causes it to be displayed as specified  by
              the  <b>-activebackground</b>  and  <b>-activerelief</b>  options.   The  only element values understood by this
              command are <b>arrow1</b>, <b>slider</b>, or <b>arrow2</b>.  If any other value is specified then  no  element  of  the
              scrollbar  will  be  active.   If  <u>element</u>  is  not specified, the command returns the name of the
              element that is currently active, or an empty string if no element is active.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the
              values accepted by the <b>scrollbar</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u>  is  specified,  returns  a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on
              the  format  of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list
              describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist  of  the
              value  returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then
              the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given  value(s);   in  this  case  the
              command  returns  an  empty  string.   <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the <b>scrollbar</b>
              command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delta</b> <u>deltaX</u> <u>deltaY</u>
              Returns a real number indicating the fractional change in the scrollbar setting  that  corresponds
              to  a  given  change  in slider position.  For example, if the scrollbar is horizontal, the result
              indicates how much the scrollbar setting must change to move the slider <u>deltaX</u> pixels to the right
              (<u>deltaY</u> is ignored in this case).  If the scrollbar is vertical, the result indicates how much the
              scrollbar setting must change to move the slider <u>deltaY</u> pixels down.  The arguments and the result
              may be zero or negative.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>fraction</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
              Returns a real number between 0 and 1 indicating where the point given by <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>  lies  in  the
              trough area of the scrollbar.  The value 0 corresponds to the top or left of the trough, the value
              1  corresponds  to the bottom or right, 0.5 corresponds to the middle, and so on.  <u>X</u> and <u>y</u> must be
              pixel coordinates relative to the scrollbar widget.  If <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>  refer  to  a  point  outside  the
              trough, the closest point in the trough is used.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>get</b>
              Returns  the scrollbar settings in the form of a list whose elements are the arguments to the most
              recent <b>set</b> widget command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>identify</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
              Returns the name of the element under the point given by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> (such as  <b>arrow1</b>),  or  an  empty
              string  if  the  point  does  not  lie  in  any  element  of the scrollbar.  <u>X</u> and <u>y</u> must be pixel
              coordinates relative to the scrollbar widget.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>set</b> <u>first</u> <u>last</u>
              This command is invoked by the scrollbar's associated widget  to  tell  the  scrollbar  about  the
              current  view  in  the  widget.  The command takes two arguments, each of which is a real fraction
              between 0 and 1.  The fractions describe the  range  of  the  document  that  is  visible  in  the
              associated  widget.  For example, if <u>first</u> is 0.2 and <u>last</u> is 0.4, it means that the first part of
              the document visible in the window is 20% of the way through the document, and  the  last  visible
              part is 40% of the way through.

</pre><h4><b>SCROLLING</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       When  the  user  interacts with the scrollbar, for example by dragging the slider, the scrollbar notifies
       the associated widget that it must change its view.  The scrollbar makes the notification by evaluating a
       Tcl command generated from the scrollbar's <b>-command</b> option.  The command may take any  of  the  following
       forms.   In  each  case, <u>prefix</u> is the contents of the <b>-command</b> option, which usually has a form like “<b>.t</b>
       <b>yview</b>”.

       <u>prefix</u> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
              <u>Fraction</u> is a real number between 0 and 1.  The widget should adjust its view so  that  the  point
              given  by  <u>fraction</u>  appears  at  the  beginning of the widget.  If <u>fraction</u> is 0 it refers to the
              beginning of the document.  1.0 refers to the end of the document, 0.333 refers to  a  point  one-
              third of the way through the document, and so on.

       <u>prefix</u> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <b>pages</b>
              The  widget  should adjust its view by <u>number</u> pages.  It is up to the widget to define the meaning
              of a page;  typically it is slightly less than what fits in the window, so that there is a  slight
              overlap  between  the  old  and  new  views.  <u>Number</u> is either 1, which means the next page should
              become visible, or -1, which means that  the  previous  page  should  become  visible.  Fractional
              numbers are rounded away from 0, so scrolling 0.001 pages has the same effect as scrolling 1 page.

       <u>prefix</u> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <b>units</b>
              The  widget  should  adjust its view by <u>number</u> units.  The units are defined in whatever way makes
              sense for the widget, such as characters or lines in a text widget.  <u>Number</u>  is  either  1,  which
              means  one  unit should scroll off the top or left of the window, or -1, which means that one unit
              should scroll off the bottom or right of the window. Fractional numbers are rounded away  from  0,
              so scrolling 0.001 units has the same effect as scrolling 1 unit.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk automatically creates class bindings for scrollbars that give them the following default behavior.  If
       the behavior is different for vertical and horizontal scrollbars, the horizontal behavior is described in
       parentheses.

       [1]    Pressing  button  1 over <b>arrow1</b> causes the view in the associated widget to shift up (left) by one
              unit so that the document appears to move down (right) one unit.  If the button is held down,  the
              action auto-repeats.

       [2]    Pressing  button 1 over <b>trough1</b> causes the view in the associated widget to shift up (left) by one
              screenful so that the document appears to move down (right) one screenful.  If the button is  held
              down, the action auto-repeats.

       [3]    Pressing  button  1  over the slider and dragging causes the view to drag with the slider.  If the
              <b>jump</b> option is true, then the view does not drag along with the slider;  it changes only when  the
              mouse button is released.

       [4]    Pressing  button  1 over <b>trough2</b> causes the view in the associated widget to shift down (right) by
              one screenful so that the document appears to move up (left) one screenful.  If the button is held
              down, the action auto-repeats.

       [5]    Pressing button 1 over <b>arrow2</b> causes the view in the associated widget to shift  down  (right)  by
              one unit so that the document appears to move up (left) one unit.  If the button is held down, the
              action auto-repeats.

       [6]    If  button 2 is pressed over the trough or the slider, it sets the view to correspond to the mouse
              position;  dragging the mouse with button 2 down causes the view  to  drag  with  the  mouse.   If
              button 2 is pressed over one of the arrows, it causes the same behavior as pressing button 1.

       [7]    If  button 1 is pressed with the Control key down, then if the mouse is over <b>arrow1</b> or <b>trough1</b> the
              view changes to the very top (left) of the document;  if the mouse is over <b>arrow2</b> or  <b>trough2</b>  the
              view  changes  to the very bottom (right) of the document;  if the mouse is anywhere else then the
              button press has no effect.

       [8]    In vertical scrollbars the Up and Down keys have the same behavior as mouse clicks over <b>arrow1</b> and
              <b>arrow2</b>, respectively.  In horizontal scrollbars these keys have no effect.

       [9]    In vertical scrollbars Control-Up and Control-Down have the same behavior  as  mouse  clicks  over
              <b>trough1</b> and <b>trough2</b>, respectively.  In horizontal scrollbars these keys have no effect.

       [10]   In  horizontal  scrollbars the Up and Down keys have the same behavior as mouse clicks over <b>arrow1</b>
              and <b>arrow2</b>, respectively.  In vertical scrollbars these keys have no effect.

       [11]   In horizontal scrollbars Control-Up and Control-Down have the same behavior as mouse  clicks  over
              <b>trough1</b> and <b>trough2</b>, respectively.  In vertical scrollbars these keys have no effect.

       [12]   The  Prior  and  Next  keys  have  the  same  behavior  as  mouse clicks over <b>trough1</b> and <b>trough2</b>,
              respectively.

       [13]   The Home key adjusts the view to the top (left edge) of the document.

       [14]   The End key adjusts the view to the bottom (right edge) of the document.
