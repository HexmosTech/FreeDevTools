       Tk::Scrollbar - Create and manipulate Scrollbar widgets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$scrollbar</u> = <u>$parent</u>-&gt;<b>Scrollbar</b>(?<u>options</u>?);

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-activebackground</b>   <b>-highlightbackground</b>     <b>-orient</b>   <b>-takefocus</b>
       <b>-background</b>    <b>-highlightcolor</b>     <b>-relief</b>   <b>-troughcolor</b> <b>-borderwidth</b>   <b>-highlightthickness</b> <b>-repeatdelay</b>
       <b>-cursor</b>   <b>-jump</b>     <b>-repeatinterval</b>

       See Tk::options for details of the standard options.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Name:     <b>activeRelief</b>
       Class:    <b>ActiveRelief</b>
       Switch:   <b>-activerelief</b>
           Specifies  the relief to use when displaying the element that is active, if any.  Elements other than
           the active element are always displayed with a raised relief.

       Name:     <b>command</b>
       Class:    <b>Command</b>
       Switch:   <b>-command</b>
           Specifies a callback to invoke to change the view in the widget associated with the scrollbar.   When
           a  user  requests a view change by manipulating the scrollbar, the callback is invoked.  The callback
           is passed additional arguments as described later. This option almost always  has  a  value  such  as
           <b>[xview</b>  <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$widget]</b> or <b>[yview</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$widget]</b>, consisting of the a widget object and either <b>xview</b> (if the
           scrollbar is for horizontal scrolling) or <b>yview</b> (for vertical  scrolling).   All  scrollable  widgets
           have  <b>xview</b> and <b>yview</b> methods that take exactly the additional arguments appended by the scrollbar as
           described in "SCROLLING COMMANDS" below.

       Name:     <b>elementBorderWidth</b>
       Class:    <b>BorderWidth</b>
       Switch:   <b>-elementborderwidth</b>
           Specifies the width of borders drawn around the internal elements of the scrollbar  (the  two  arrows
           and  the  slider).  The value may have any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  If this value is
           less than zero, the value of the <b>borderWidth</b> option is used in its place.

       Name:     <b>width</b>
       Class:    <b>Width</b>
       Switch:   <b>-width</b>
           Specifies the desired narrow dimension of the scrollbar window, not including  3-D  border,  if  any.
           For vertical scrollbars this will be the width and for horizontal scrollbars this will be the height.
           The value may have any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>Scrollbar</b>  method creates a new window (given by the $widget argument) and makes it into a scrollbar
       widget.  Additional options, described above, may be specified on the  command  line  or  in  the  option
       database  to  configure  aspects  of  the  scrollbar  such  as  its colors, orientation, and relief.  The
       <b>scrollbar</b> command returns its $widget argument.  At the time this command  is  invoked,  there  must  not
       exist a window named $widget, but $widget's parent must exist.

       A  scrollbar  is a widget that displays two arrows, one at each end of the scrollbar, and a <u>slider</u> in the
       middle portion of the scrollbar.  It provides information about what is visible in an  <u>associated</u>  <u>window</u>
       that displays an document of some sort (such as a file being edited or a drawing).  The position and size
       of  the  slider indicate which portion of the document is visible in the associated window.  For example,
       if the slider in a vertical scrollbar covers the top third of the area between the two arrows,  it  means
       that the associated window displays the top third of its document.

       Scrollbars  can  be  used  to  adjust  the view in the associated window by clicking or dragging with the
       mouse.  See "BINDINGS" below for details.

</pre><h4><b>ELEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       A scrollbar displays five elements, which are referred to in the methods for the scrollbar:

       <b>arrow1</b>
           The top or left arrow in the scrollbar.

       <b>trough1</b>
           The region between the slider and <b>arrow1</b>.

       <b>slider</b>
           The rectangle that indicates what is visible in the associated widget.

       <b>trough2</b>
           The region between the slider and <b>arrow2</b>.

       <b>arrow2</b>
           The bottom or right arrow in the scrollbar.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Scrollbar</b> method creates a widget object.  This  object  supports  the  <b>configure</b>  and  <b>cget</b>  methods
       described in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify the options described above.  The widget
       also inherits all the methods provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.

       The following additional methods are available for scrollbar widgets:

       <u>$scrollbar</u>-&gt;<b>activate</b>(?<u>element</u>?)
           Marks the element indicated by <u>element</u> as active, which causes it to be displayed as specified by the
           <b>activeBackground</b>  and  <b>activeRelief</b>  options.  The only element values understood by this command are
           <b>arrow1</b>, <b>slider</b>, or <b>arrow2</b>.  If any other value is specified then no element of the scrollbar will  be
           active.   If  <u>element</u> is not specified, the command returns the name of the element that is currently
           active, or an empty string if no element is active.

       <u>$scrollbar</u>-&gt;<b>delta</b>(<u>deltaX,</u> <u>deltaY</u>)
           Returns a real number indicating the fractional change in the scrollbar setting that corresponds to a
           given change in slider position.  For example, if the scrollbar is horizontal, the  result  indicates
           how  much  the scrollbar setting must change to move the slider <u>deltaX</u> pixels to the right (<u>deltaY</u> is
           ignored in this case).  If the scrollbar is vertical, the result indicates  how  much  the  scrollbar
           setting  must change to move the slider <u>deltaY</u> pixels down.  The arguments and the result may be zero
           or negative.

       <u>$scrollbar</u>-&gt;<b>fraction</b>(<u>x,</u> <u>y</u>)
           Returns a real number between 0 and 1 indicating where the point given by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> lies in the  trough
           area  of  the  scrollbar.   The  value  0  corresponds  to the top or left of the trough, the value 1
           corresponds to the bottom or right, 0.5 corresponds to the middle, and so on.  <u>X</u> and <u>y</u> must be  pixel
           coordinates  relative  to  the scrollbar widget.  If <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> refer to a point outside the trough, the
           closest point in the trough is used.

       <u>$scrollbar</u>-&gt;<b>get</b>
           Returns the scrollbar settings in the form of a list whose elements are the  arguments  to  the  most
           recent <b>set</b> method.

       <u>$scrollbar</u>-&gt;<b>identify</b>(<u>x,</u> <u>y</u>)
           Returns the name of the element under the point given by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> (such as <b>arrow1</b>), or an empty string
           if  the  point  does  not  lie  in  any  element of the scrollbar.  <u>X</u> and <u>y</u> must be pixel coordinates
           relative to the scrollbar widget.

       <u>$scrollbar</u>-&gt;<b>set</b>(<u>first,</u> <u>last</u>)
           This command is invoked by the scrollbar's associated widget to tell the scrollbar about the  current
           view  in the widget.  The command takes two arguments, each of which is a real fraction between 0 and
           1.  The fractions describe the range of the document that is visible in the associated  widget.   For
           example, if <u>first</u> is 0.2 and <u>last</u> is 0.4, it means that the first part of the document visible in the
           window is 20% of the way through the document, and the last visible part is 40% of the way through.

</pre><h4><b>SCROLLING</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       When  the  user  interacts with the scrollbar, for example by dragging the slider, the scrollbar notifies
       the associated widget that it must change its view.  The scrollbar makes the notification by evaluating a
       callback specified as the scrollbar's <b>-command</b> option.  The callback may take  several  forms.   In  each
       case, the initial arguments passed are those specified in the <b>-command</b> callback itself, which usually has
       a  form  like [<b>yview</b> =&gt; <u>$widget</u>].  (Which will invoke <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>yview</b>(...) where the ... part is as below.
       See Tk::callbacks for details.)  The callback is passed additional arguments as follows:

       <b>moveto</b>,<u>fraction</u>
           <u>Fraction</u> is a real number between 0 and 1.  The widget should adjust its view so that the point given
           by <u>fraction</u> appears at the beginning of the widget.  If <u>fraction</u> is 0 it refers to the  beginning  of
           the  document.   1.0  refers to the end of the document, 0.333 refers to a point one-third of the way
           through the document, and so on.

       <b>scroll,</b><u>number,</u><b>units</b>
           The widget should adjust its view by <u>number</u> units.  The units are defined in whatever way makes sense
           for the widget, such as characters or lines in a text widget.  <u>Number</u> is either 1,  which  means  one
           unit  should scroll off the top or left of the window, or -1, which means that one unit should scroll
           off the bottom or right of the window.

       <b>scroll</b>,<u>number</u>,<b>page</b>
           The widget should adjust its view by <u>number</u> pages.  It is up to the widget to define the meaning of a
           page;  typically it is slightly less than what fits in the window, so that there is a slight  overlap
           between  the old and new views.  <u>Number</u> is either 1, which means the next page should become visible,
           or -1, which means that the previous page should become visible.

</pre><h4><b>OLD</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       In versions of Tk before 4.0, the <b>set</b> and <b>get</b> widget commands used a different form.  This form is  still
       supported  for  backward  compatibility, but it is deprecated.  In the old command syntax, the <b>set</b> method
       has the following form:

       <u>$scrollbar</u>-&gt;<b>set</b>(<u>totalUnits,</u> <u>windowUnits,</u> <u>firstUnit,</u> <u>lastUnit</u>)
           In this form the arguments are all integers.  <u>TotalUnits</u> gives the total size  of  the  object  being
           displayed  in  the associated widget.  The meaning of one unit depends on the associated widget;  for
           example, in a text editor widget units might correspond to lines of text.  <u>WindowUnits</u> indicates  the
           total number of units that can fit in the associated window at one time.  <u>FirstUnit</u> and <u>lastUnit</u> give
           the  indices of the first and last units currently visible in the associated window (zero corresponds
           to the first unit of the object).

       Under the old syntax the <b>get</b> method returns a list  of  four  integers,  consisting  of  the  <u>totalUnits</u>,
       <u>windowUnits</u>, <u>firstUnit</u>, and <u>lastUnit</u> values from the last <b>set</b> method.

       The  callbacks  generated by scrollbars also have a different form when the old syntax is being used, the
       callback is passed a single argument:

       <u>unit</u>
           <u>Unit</u> is an integer that indicates what should appear at the top or left of  the  associated  widget's
           window.  It has the same meaning as the <u>firstUnit</u> and <u>lastUnit</u> arguments to the <b>set</b> method.

       The  most  recent  <b>set</b>  method  determines whether or not to use the old syntax.  If it is given two real
       arguments then the new syntax will be used in the future, and if it is given four integer arguments  then
       the old syntax will be used.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk automatically creates class bindings for scrollbars that give them the following default behavior.  If
       the behavior is different for vertical and horizontal scrollbars, the horizontal behavior is described in
       parentheses.

       [1] Pressing button 1 over <b>arrow1</b> causes the view in the associated widget to shift up (left) by one unit
           so  that  the document appears to move down (right) one unit.  If the button is held down, the action
           auto-repeats.

       [2] Pressing button 1 over <b>trough1</b> causes the view in the associated widget to shift  up  (left)  by  one
           screenful  so  that  the  document appears to move down (right) one screenful.  If the button is held
           down, the action auto-repeats.

       [3] Pressing button 1 over the slider and dragging causes the view to drag with the slider.  If the  <b>jump</b>
           option  is  true,  then  the view doesn't drag along with the slider;  it changes only when the mouse
           button is released.

       [4] Pressing button 1 over <b>trough2</b> causes the view in the associated widget to shift down (right) by  one
           screenful  so that the document appears to move up (left) one screenful.  If the button is held down,
           the action auto-repeats.

       [5] Pressing button 1 over <b>arrow2</b> causes the view in the associated widget to shift down (right)  by  one
           unit so that the document appears to move up (left) one unit.  If the button is held down, the action
           auto-repeats.

       [6] If  button  2  is  pressed over the trough or the slider, it sets the view to correspond to the mouse
           position;  dragging the mouse with button 2 down causes the view to drag with the mouse.  If button 2
           is pressed over one of the arrows, it causes the same behavior as pressing button 1.

       [7] If button 1 is pressed with the Control key down, then if the mouse is over  <b>arrow1</b>  or  <b>trough1</b>  the
           view changes to the very top (left) of the document;  if the mouse is over <b>arrow2</b> or <b>trough2</b> the view
           changes  to  the  very bottom (right) of the document;  if the mouse is anywhere else then the button
           press has no effect.

       [8] In vertical scrollbars the Up and Down keys have the same behavior as mouse clicks  over  <b>arrow1</b>  and
           <b>arrow2</b>, respectively.  In horizontal scrollbars these keys have no effect.

       [9] In  vertical  scrollbars  Control-Up  and  Control-Down  have  the same behavior as mouse clicks over
           <b>trough1</b> and <b>trough2</b>, respectively.  In horizontal scrollbars these keys have no effect.

       [10]
           In horizontal scrollbars the Up and Down keys have the same behavior as mouse clicks over <b>arrow1</b>  and
           <b>arrow2</b>, respectively.  In vertical scrollbars these keys have no effect.

       [11]
           In  horizontal  scrollbars  Control-Up  and  Control-Down have the same behavior as mouse clicks over
           <b>trough1</b> and <b>trough2</b>, respectively.  In vertical scrollbars these keys have no effect.

       [12]
           The Prior and  Next  keys  have  the  same  behavior  as  mouse  clicks  over  <b>trough1</b>  and  <b>trough2</b>,
           respectively.

       [13]
           The Home key adjusts the view to the top (left edge) of the document.

       [14]
           The End key adjusts the view to the bottom (right edge) of the document.
