       News::Scan - gather and report Usenet newsgroup statistics

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use News::Scan;

           my $scan = News::Scan-&gt;new;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a class whose objects can be used to gather and report Usenet newsgroup statistics.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       new ( [ OPTIONS ] )
           "OPTIONS" is a list of named parameters (i.e. given in key-value pairs).  Valid options are

       <b>Group</b>   The value of this option is the name of the newsgroup you wish to scan.

       <b>From</b>    The value of this option should be either 'spool' or 'NNTP' (case is not significant).  Any other
               value  will  produce  an  error  (see  the "error" method description below).  A value of 'spool'
               indicates that you would like to scan articles in a spool (see the <b>Spool</b> option below).  A  value
               of  'NNTP'  indicates that articles should be retrieved from your NNTP server (see the <b>NNTPServer</b>
               option below).

       <b>Spool</b>   The value of this option should be the path to the spool directory that contains the articles you
               would like to scan.  This option is ignored unless the value of <b>From</b> is 'spool'.

       <b>NNTPServer</b>
               The value of this option (in the form <u>server</u>:<u>port</u>, with both being  optional--see  Net::NNTP  for
               the  semantics  of omitting one or both of these parameters) indicates the NNTP server from which
               to retrieve articles.  This option is ignored unless <b>From</b> is 'NNTP'.  See the description of  the
               <b>NNTPAuthLogin</b> and <b>NNTPAuthPasswd</b> options below.

       <b>NNTPAuthLogin</b>
               The  value of this option should be a valid NNTP authentication login for your NNTP server.  This
               option is only necessary if your NNTP server requires authentication.

       <b>NNTPAuthPasswd</b>
               The value of this option should be the password corresponding  to  the  login  in  <b>NNTPAuthLogin</b>.
               Having this hardcoded in a script is evil, and there should be a much better way.

       <b>Period</b>  The  value  of  this  option  indicates  the  length of the period (in days) immediately prior to
               invocation of the program from which you would like to scan  articles.   The  default  period  is
               seven (7) days.

       <b>QuoteRE</b> The  value  of  this  option  is  a Perl regular expression that accepts quoted lines and rejects
               unquoted or original lines.  The default regular expression is "^\s{0,3}(?:"|:|\S+&gt;|\+\+)&gt;.

       <b>Exclude</b> The value of this option should be a reference to an array containing  regular  expressions  that
               accept email addresses of posters whose articles you wish to ignore.

       <b>Aliases</b> The  value  of  this  option  should be a reference to a hash whose keys are email addresses that
               should be transformed into the email addresses that are their corresponding values,  i.e.  "alias
               =" 'real@address'&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       configure ( [ OPTIONS ] )
           "OPTIONS"  is a list of named parameters identical to those accepted by "new".  Re-"configure"-ing an
           object after scanning is probably a bad idea.  This method returns "undef" if it encounters an error.

       The following methods are the actual underlying methods  used  to  set  and  retrieve  the  configuration
       options of the same name (modulo case):

       name ( [ NEWSGROUP-NAME ] )
       spool ( [ SPOOL-DIRECTORY ] )
       period ( [ INTERVAL-LENGTH ] )
       aliases ( [ ALIASES-HASHREF ] )
       from ( 'NNTP' | 'spool' )
       quote_re ( [ QUOTE-REGEX-ARRAYREF ] )
       exclude ( [ EXCLUSION-REGEX-ARRAYREF ] )
       nntp_server ( [ [ NNTP-SERVER ]:[ NNTP-PORT ] ] )
       nntp_auth_login ( [ LOGIN ] )
       nntp_auth_passwd ( [ PASSWORD ] )

       These  methods can be used to retrieve information from the "News::Scan" object or ask it to perform some
       action.

       error ( [ MESSAGE ] )
           Use this method to determine whether an object has encountered an error condition.  The return  value
           of  "error" is guaranteed to be 0 after any method completes successfully (except "error").  (Keep in
           mind that this will also overwrite any previous error message.)  If there has  been  an  error,  this
           method should return some useful message.

           If provided, "MESSAGE" sets the object's error message.

       articles
           Returns the number of articles accounted for.

       volume
           Returns the volume of traffic (in bytes) to the newsgroup in the period.

       header_volume
           Returns the volume (in bytes) generated by headers.

       header_lines
           Returns the number of lines consumed by headers.

       body_volume
           Returns the volume (in bytes) generated by message bodies.

       body_lines
           Returns the number of lines consumed by message bodies.

       orig_volume
           Returns  the  volume (in bytes) of text which has been determined to be original (see <b>QuoteRE</b>).  Note
           that original traffic is a subset of body traffic.

       orig_lines
           Returns the number of lines that are determined to be original.

       signatures
           Returns the number of messages that had a cutline (/^-- $/).

       sig_volume
           Returns the volume (in bytes) generated by signatures.

       sig_lines
           Returns the number of lines consumed by signatures.

       earliest ( [ TIME ] )
           Use this method to determine the date (in seconds since the Epoch)  that  the  oldest  article  found
           within the period was posted to Usenet.

           If  "TIME"  is given, it is treated as a candidate for the earliest article.  If "TIME" is successful
           (i.e. is less than the previous earliest), this method returns 1, else 0.

       latest ( [ TIME ] )
           Use this method to determine the date (in seconds since the Epoch) that the  youngest  article  found
           within the period was posted to Usenet.

           If  "TIME"  is  given,  it is treated as a candidate for the latest article.  If "TIME" is successful
           (i.e. is greater than the previous latest), this method returns 1, else 0.

       excludes
           Returns the list of regular expressions used to determine whether  an  article  from  a  given  email
           address should be ignored.

       posters
           Returns   a   reference   to   a   hash   whose  keys  are  email  addresses  and  whose  values  are
           "News::Scan::Poster" objects corresponding to those email addresses.  See News::Scan::Poster.

       threads
           Returns a reference to a hash whose keys are  subjects  and  whose  values  are  "News::Scan::Thread"
           objects corresponding to those subjects.  See News::Scan::Thread.

       crossposts
           Returns a reference to a hash whose keys are newsgroup names and whose values are the number of times
           the corresponding groups have been crossposted to.

       collect
           Use  this  method  to  mirror  the  articles  from the specified  NNTP server to the specified spool.
           Please be kind to the NNTP server.

       scan
           Instruct the object to gather information about the newsgroup.
