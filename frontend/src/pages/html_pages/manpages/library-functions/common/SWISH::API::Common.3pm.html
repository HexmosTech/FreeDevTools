       SWISH::API::Common - SWISH Document Indexing Made Easy

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use SWISH::API::Common;

           my $swish = SWISH::API::Common-&gt;new();

               # Index all files in a directory and its subdirectories
           $swish-&gt;index("/usr/local/share/doc");

               # After indexing once (it's persistent), fire up as many
               # queries as you like:

               # Search documents containing both "swish" and "install"
           for my $hit ($swish-&gt;search("swish AND install")) {
               print $hit-&gt;path(), "\n";
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "SWISH::API::Common" offers an easy interface to the Swish index engine.  While SWISH::API offers a
       complete API, "SWISH::API::Common" focusses on ease of use.

       THIS MODULE IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT. THE API MIGHT CHANGE AT ANY TIME.

       Currently, "SWISH::API::Common" just allows for indexing documents in a single directory and any of its
       subdirectories. Also, don't run <b>index()</b> and <b>search()</b> in parallel yet.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       "SWISH::API::Common" requires "SWISH::API" and the swish engine to be installed. Please download the
       latest release from

           <a href="http://swish-e.org/distribution/swish-e-2.4.3.tar.gz">http://swish-e.org/distribution/swish-e-2.4.3.tar.gz</a>

       and untar it, type

           ./configure
           make
           make install

       and then install SWISH::API which is contained in the distribution:

           cd perl
           perl Makefile.PL
           make
           make install

   <b>METHODS</b>
       $sw = SWISH::API::Common-&gt;<b>new()</b>
           Constructor. Takes many options, but the defaults are usually fine.

           Available options and their defaults:

                   # Where SWISH::API::Common stores index files etc.
               swish_adm_dir   "$ENV{HOME}/.swish-common"

                   # The path to swish-e, relative is OK
               swish_exe       "swish-e"

                   # Swish index file
               swish_idx_file  "$self-&gt;{swish_adm_dir}/default.idx"

                   # Swish configuration file
               swish_cnf_file  "$self-&gt;{swish_adm_dir}/default.cnf"

                   # SWISH Stemming
               swish_fuzzy_indexing_mode =&gt; "Stemming_en"

                   # Maximum amount of data (in bytes) extracted
                   # from a single file
               file_len_max 100_000

                   # Preserve every indexed file's atime
               atime_preserve

       $sw-&gt;index($dir, ...)
           Generate a new index of all text documents under directory $dir. One
            or more directories can be specified.

       $sw-&gt;search("foo AND bar");
           Searches  the  index,  using the given search expression. Returns a list hits, which can be asked for
           their path:

                   # Search documents containing
                   # both "foo" and "bar"
               for my $hit ($swish-&gt;search("foo AND bar")) {
                   print $hit-&gt;path(), "\n";
               }

       index_remove
           Permanently delete the current index.
