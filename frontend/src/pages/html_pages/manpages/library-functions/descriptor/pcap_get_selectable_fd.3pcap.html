       pcap_get_selectable_fd - get a file descriptor on which a select() can be done for a live capture

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd(pcap_t</b> <b>*p);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd</b>()  returns,  on  UNIX, a file descriptor number for a file descriptor on which one
       can do a <b><a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/kevent.2.html">kevent</a></b>(2), or other such call to wait for it to  be  possible
       to read packets without blocking, if such a descriptor exists, or <b>-1</b>, if no such descriptor exists.

       Some    network    devices   opened   with   <b><a href="../man3PCAP/pcap_create.3PCAP.html">pcap_create</a></b>(3PCAP)   and   <b><a href="../man3PCAP/pcap_activate.3PCAP.html">pcap_activate</a></b>(3PCAP),   or   with
       <b><a href="../man3PCAP/pcap_open_live.3PCAP.html">pcap_open_live</a></b>(3PCAP), do not support those calls (for example, regular network devices  on  FreeBSD  4.3
       and 4.4, and Endace DAG devices), so <b>-1</b> is returned for those devices.  In that case, those calls must be
       given a timeout less than or equal to the timeout returned by <b><a href="../man3PCAP/pcap_get_required_select_timeout.3PCAP.html">pcap_get_required_select_timeout</a></b>(3PCAP) for
       the  device  for  which <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd</b>() returned <b>-1</b>, the device must be put in non-blocking mode
       with a call to <b><a href="../man3PCAP/pcap_setnonblock.3PCAP.html">pcap_setnonblock</a></b>(3PCAP), and an attempt must always be  made  to  read  packets  from  the
       device  when the call returns.  If <b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout</b>() returns <b>NULL</b>, it is not possible to
       wait for packets to arrive on the device in an event loop.

       Note that a device on which a read can be done without blocking may, on  some  platforms,  not  have  any
       packets  to  read  if  the  packet  buffer  timeout  has  expired.   A  call  to  <b><a href="../man3PCAP/pcap_dispatch.3PCAP.html">pcap_dispatch</a></b>(3PCAP) or
       <b><a href="../man3PCAP/pcap_next_ex.3PCAP.html">pcap_next_ex</a></b>(3PCAP) will return 0 in this case, but will not block.

       Note that in:

              FreeBSD prior to FreeBSD 4.6;

              NetBSD prior to NetBSD 3.0;

              OpenBSD prior to OpenBSD 2.4;

              Mac OS X prior to Mac OS X 10.7;

       <b>select</b>(), <b>poll</b>(), and <b>kevent</b>() do not work correctly on BPF devices; <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd</b>() will return
       a file descriptor on most of those versions (the exceptions being FreeBSD 4.3  and  4.4),  but  a  simple
       <b>select</b>(),  <b>poll</b>(),  or  <b>kevent</b>()  call  will  not  indicate  that the descriptor is readable until a full
       buffer's worth of packets is received, even if the packet timeout expires before then.   To  work  around
       this,  code that uses those calls to wait for packets to arrive must put the <b>pcap_t</b> in non-blocking mode,
       and must arrange that the call have a timeout less than or equal to the packet buffer timeout,  and  must
       try  to  read  packets after that timeout expires, regardless of whether the call indicated that the file
       descriptor for the <b>pcap_t</b> is ready to be read or not.  (That workaround will not work in FreeBSD 4.3  and
       later;  however,  in  FreeBSD 4.6 and later, those calls work correctly on BPF devices, so the workaround
       isn't necessary, although it does no harm.)

       Note also that <b>poll</b>() and <b>kevent</b>() doesn't work on character special files, including BPF devices, in Mac
       OS  X  10.4  and  10.5,  so,   while   <b>select</b>()   can   be   used   on   the   descriptor   returned   by
       <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd</b>(),  <b>poll</b>()  and <b>kevent</b>() cannot be used on it those versions of Mac OS X.  <b>poll</b>(),
       but not <b>kevent</b>(), works on that descriptor in Mac OS X releases prior to 10.4; <b>poll</b>() and  <b>kevent</b>()  work
       on that descriptor in Mac OS X 10.6 and later.

       <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd</b>() is not available on Windows.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       A selectable file descriptor is returned if one exists; otherwise, <b>-1</b> is returned.
