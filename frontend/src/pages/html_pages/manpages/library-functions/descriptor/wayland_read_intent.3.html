       wayland::read_intent - Represents an intention to read from the display file descriptor.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;wayland-client.hpp&gt;

   <b>Public</b> <b>Member</b> <b>Functions</b>
       bool <b>is_finalized</b> () const
           Check whether this intent was already finalized with <b>cancel</b> or <b>read</b>.
       void <b>cancel</b> ()
           Cancel read intent.
       void <b>read</b> ()
           Read events from display file descriptor.

</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Represents an intention to read from the display file descriptor.

       When not using the convenience method <b>display_t::dispatch</b> that takes care of this automatically, threads
       that want to read events from a Wayland display file descriptor must announce their intention to do so
       beforehand - in the C API, this is done using wl_display_prepare_read. This intention must then be
       resolved either by actually invoking a read from the file descriptor or cancelling.

       This RAII class makes sure that when it goes out of scope, the intent is cancelled automatically if it
       was not finalized by manually cancelling or reading before. Otherwise, it would be easy to forget
       resolving the intent e.g. when handling errors, potentially leading to a deadlock.

       Read intents can only be created by a <b>display_t</b> with <b>display_t::obtain_read_intent</b> and
       <b>display_t::obtain_queue_read_intent</b>.

       Undefined behavior occurs when the associated <b>display_t</b> or <b>event_queue_t</b> is destroyed when a <b>read_intent</b>
       has not been finalized yet.

</pre><h4><b>Member</b> <b>Function</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>void</b> <b>wayland::read_intent::cancel</b> <b>()</b>
       Cancel read intent. An exception is thrown when the read intent was already finalized.

   <b>bool</b> <b>wayland::read_intent::is_finalized</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b>
       Check whether this intent was already finalized with <b>cancel</b> or <b>read</b>.

   <b>void</b> <b>wayland::read_intent::read</b> <b>()</b>
       Read events from display file descriptor. This will read events from the file descriptor for the display.
       This function does not dispatch events, it only reads and queues events into their corresponding event
       queues. If no data is avilable on the file descriptor, <b>read()</b> returns immediately. To dispatch events
       that may have been queued, call <b>display_t::dispatch_pending</b> or <b>display_t::dispatch_queue_pending</b>.

       An exception is thrown when the read intent was already finalized. Each read intent can only be used for
       reading once. A new one must be obtained for any further read requests.
