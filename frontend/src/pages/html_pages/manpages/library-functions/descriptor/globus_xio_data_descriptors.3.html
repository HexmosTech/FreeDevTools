       Data descriptors.

       globus_xio uses data descriptors to associate meta data with the data being written or the data read.

       Data descriptors flow into the drivers read and write interface functions by way of the operation
       structure. If the driver is interested in viewing the data descriptor it can request it from the
       operation structure via a call to globus_xio_driver_operation_get_data_descriptor() and it can view any
       driver specific data descriptor via a call to globus_xio_driver_data_descriptor_get_specific(). The
       driver can modify values in the data descriptor by setting values before passing the request down the
       stack. Several functions are available to modify the data descriptors. There is no need to 'set()' the
       data descriptors back into the operation. The functions for manipulating the values in a DD affect the
       values xio has directly.

       Data descriptors flow back to the driver in the callbacks for the data operations. When calling finished
       operation on a data operation the driver must pass in a data descriptor. It should get this data
       descriptor from the io operation callback.

       Life Cycle:

       Passing in a data descriptor: A data descriptor is first created by the globus_xio user. The user can add
       driver specific data descriptors to it. Once the user has created and set the attributes on its data
       descriptor to their liking they pass it into a globus_xio data operation (either read or write). When the
       data descriptor is passed on globus_xio will make an internal copy of it. It does this by first coping
       the user the level data descriptor and then walking through the list of driver specific data descriptor
       contained in to and requesting the driver make a copy of the driver specific data descriptor. If ever a
       driver specific data descriptor is NULL globus_xio need not call into its drivers dd_copy function. If
       ever the user level data descriptor is NULL globus_xio need not deal with the data descriptor
       functionality at all.

       A data descriptor coming back up the stack Once an io operation reaches the transport driver (the bottom
       of the stack) it takes on a slightly different role. On the way in it is describing what is requested to
       be done with the data, on the way out it is describing what has actually been done. Once the transport
       driver performs the operation it should adjust the data descriptor to reflect what has actually happened
       (few drivers will need to worry about this). Each driver on the way up can adjust the data descriptor and
       its driver specific data descriptor. When XIO reaches the top of the stack it calls a user callback. When
       that callback returns all memory associated with the data descriptor is cleaned up. The interface
       function globus_xio_driver_data_descriptor_free() is used for this.
