</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fattach — attach a STREAMS-based file descriptor to a file in the file system name space (<b>STREAMS</b>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;stropts.h&gt;

       int fattach(int <u>fildes</u>, const char *<u>path</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>fattach</u>() function shall attach a STREAMS-based file descriptor to a file, effectively associating a
       pathname with <u>fildes</u>.  The application shall ensure that  the  <u>fildes</u>  argument  is  a  valid  open  file
       descriptor  associated  with  a STREAMS file. The <u>path</u> argument points to a pathname of an existing file.
       The application shall have appropriate privileges or be the owner of the file  named  by  <u>path</u>  and  have
       write  permission.  A  successful call to <u>fattach</u>() shall cause all pathnames that name the file named by
       <u>path</u> to name the STREAMS file associated with <u>fildes</u>, until the STREAMS file is detached from the file. A
       STREAMS file can be attached to more than one file and can have several pathnames associated with it.

       The attributes of the named STREAMS file shall be initialized as follows: the permissions, user ID, group
       ID, and times are set to those of the file named by <u>path</u>, the number of links is set to 1, and  the  size
       and  device identifier are set to those of the STREAMS file associated with <u>fildes</u>.  If any attributes of
       the named STREAMS file are subsequently changed (for example, by <u>chmod</u>()), neither the attributes of  the
       underlying file nor the attributes of the STREAMS file to which <u>fildes</u> refers shall be affected.

       File  descriptors  referring to the underlying file, opened prior to an <u>fattach</u>() call, shall continue to
       refer to the underlying file.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, <u>fattach</u>() shall return 0. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and  <u>errno</u>  set  to
       indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>fattach</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> Search  permission  is  denied  for a component of the path prefix, or the process is the owner of
              <u>path</u> but does not have write permissions on the file named by <u>path</u>.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>fildes</u> argument is not a valid open file descriptor.

       <b>EBUSY</b>  The file named by <u>path</u> is currently a mount point or has a STREAMS file attached to it.

       <b>ELOOP</b>  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the <u>path</u> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT</b> A component of <u>path</u> does not name an existing file or <u>path</u> is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that is neither a directory nor  a  symbolic
              link  to  a  directory,  or the <u>path</u> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt; character and ends
              with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters.

       <b>EPERM</b>  The effective user ID of the process is not the owner of the file named by <u>path</u>  and  the  process
              does not have appropriate privileges.

       The <u>fattach</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The <u>fildes</u> argument does not refer to a STREAMS file.

       <b>ELOOP</b>  More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the <u>path</u> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an
              intermediate result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       <b>EXDEV</b>  A link to a file on another file system was attempted.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Attaching</b> <b>a</b> <b>File</b> <b>Descriptor</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>File</b>
       In the following example, <u>fd</u> refers to an open STREAMS file. The call to <u>fattach</u>() associates this STREAM
       with  the file <b>/tmp/named-STREAM</b>, such that any future calls to open <b>/tmp/named-STREAM</b>, prior to breaking
       the attachment via a call to <u>fdetach</u>(), will instead create a new file handle referring  to  the  STREAMS
       file associated with <u>fd</u>.

           #include &lt;stropts.h&gt;
           ...
               int fd;
               char *pathname = "/tmp/named-STREAM";
               int ret;

               ret = fattach(fd, pathname);

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>fattach</u>()  function  behaves  similarly  to  the  traditional  <u>mount</u>() function in the way a file is
       temporarily replaced by the root directory of the mounted file system. In  the  case  of  <u>fattach</u>(),  the
       replaced file need not be a directory and the replacing file is a STREAMS file.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  file  attributes  of  a  file  which  has been the subject of an <u>fattach</u>() call are specifically set
       because of an artifact of the original implementation. The internal mechanism was the  same  as  for  the
       <u>mount</u>()  function.  Since <u>mount</u>() is typically only applied to directories, the effects when applied to a
       regular file are a little surprising, especially as regards the link count  which  rigidly  remains  one,
       even  if  there  were  several links originally and despite the fact that all original links refer to the
       STREAM as long as the <u>fattach</u>() remains in effect.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>fattach</u>() function may be removed in a future version.
