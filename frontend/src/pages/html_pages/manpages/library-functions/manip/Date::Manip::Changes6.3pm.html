</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Date::Manip::Changes6 - changes in Date::Manip 6.xx

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This describes the changes made to the Date::Manip module in the 6.xx series of releases.  Major changes
       are marked with asterisks (*).

       For the most part, Date::Manip has remained backward compatible at every release, but occasionally, a
       change is made which is backward incompatible. These are marked with an exclamation mark (!).

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>6.97</b> <b>(2025-03-02)</b></h4><pre>
       Fix to avoid warnings in perl 5.41.*
            The newest development version of perl gives 'possible precedence problem' warnings for a few lines.
            Those lines have been fixed by adding some parentheses to avoid any precedence ambiguity.

            Reported in GitHub #51

       Added a requested alternative to 'ago'.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>6.95</b> <b>(2024-03-01)</b></h4><pre>
       Better support for weeks of the year
            Added  the Week1ofYear config variable and deprecated the Jan1Week1 variable.  The first week of the
            year can now be specified much more easily.

       Support for the standard POSIX strftime directives in printf
            The Date::Manip::Date::printf method uses a set of directives which is similar, but  not  identical,
            to the POSIX strftime directives.

            A new config variable Use_POSIX_Printf has been added.  If set, the printf method will use the POSIX
            strftime  directives  more fully (see the PRINTF DIRECTIVES section in the Date::Manip::Date POD for
            more information).

            #40.

            The UTC timezone is now named Etc/UTC instead of UTC to be in line with the aliases.

       Documentation fixes
            The  version numbers in the change log was messed up due to a skipped release (no new timezone fixes
            that time).  Fixed.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>6.89</b> <b>(2022-09-01)</b></h4><pre>
       (!) Date::Manip 5.xx interface to be removed
            The old version of Date::Manip (version 5.xx) has been distributed as part of the package  in  order
            to support versions of perl older than 5.10 .  I see no valid reason to continue to support that, so
            as  of  version 7.00, Date::Manip will only include the newer interfaces (which require perl 5.10 or
            newer).  There are no plans to deprecate the functional interface.

            All warnings are now issued with the carp command  rather  than  warn.   Requested  in  GitHub  pull
            request #18, but that request was not used because it only changed the uses in the Date::Manip::Date
            module.

       Bug fixes

           The tarball had a .travis.yml file in it that wasn't in the MANIFEST file.  Since the  MANIFEST  file
           is  automatically  generated by the perl mkmanifest tool, since it didn't see the .travis.yml file, I
           have excluded it from the tarball.  Reported by Mohammad S Anwar on GitHub (#23)

       Fixed math on non-64-bit architectures
           Much of the math in Date::Manip::Base is in a 'use integer' section.  This math can overflow in  some
           cases  in  non-64-bit architectures.  Fixed the cases where this would reasonably occur.  Reported by
           Daniel Albers (GitHub #22).  Also reported and tested in RT 126052.

       Bug in normalizing estimated business deltas
           While working on the non-64-bit issue, it uncovered a bug where normalizing estimated business deltas
           was wrong.  It had never been reported, and it was  only  off  by  a  couple  seconds  in  some  rare
           situations.

       Fixed version problem
           The wrong version was included in two files for some reason.  This is fixed.

           Fixed a grammatical error reported by Xavier Guimard (GitHub #19).

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>6.71</b> <b>(2018-06-01)</b></h4><pre>
       Fixed an extremely rare problem with recurrences
           It is possible to specify a recurrence that never produces a valid date.  In these cases, looking for
           dates went into an infinite loop.  The MaxRecurAttempts config variable was  added  which  will  stop
           that  from happening.  If no occurrence was found, an error condition will be set.  Dean Hamstead (RT
           123708)

       Changes file supported
           It was requested that I include a valid Changes file.   I  wrote  a  simple  script  to  convert  the
           Change6.pod  file  into  a valid Change file.  The Changes6.pod file is still the canonical source of
           this information!  Requested by H. Merijn Brand

       Fix for timezone determination
           On MacOS X High Sierra, some of the timezone files were symlinks, but not  properly  followed.   This
           was fixed by Stu Tomlinson (GitHub #15).

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>6.70</b> <b>(2018-03-01)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>(*)</b> <b>(!)</b> <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>deltas</b>
           Improved  handling  of  deltas  to  better support the different types of deltas.  Formalized how the
           semi-exact portions of the delta are used to produce the results that most people would expect.

           The type can now be specified to guarantee several behaviors.  Changed the arguments (in  a  backward
           compatible  way)  to  several  methods.   Explicitly  added  a  new  type (estimated) which was there
           previously, but could not be manually specified.

           The convert function continues to support converting from a less exact type to a more exact type, but
           this is deprecated and will be removed in version 7.00.

           This was prompted by a bug reported by Ian Gibbs.

       <b>(*)</b> <b>(!)</b> <b>Deprecated</b> <b>some</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Date::Manip::Delta</b>
           The options passed to the <b>set</b> and <b>parse</b> methods have changed.  The  old  style  will  be  removed  in
           version 7.00.

           Deltas  will  also  no  longer  support  the  'exact'  and 'approximate' strings (which have not been
           supported for some time).  These will be removed in 7.00 as well.

       Deprecation of TZ postponed
           The deprecation of the TZ variable has been postponed to version 7.00.

       Some speed improvements
           I converted some of the functions to use faster algorithms.  Previously, the steps  were  worked  out
           using  logical  time/calendar  based  calculations.  These were replaced with non-intuitive numerical
           calculations that gave the same result faster.

       Changed behavior if timezone not determined
           If the system timezone cannot be determined  using  any  of  the  methods  supplied  by  Date::Manip,
           operations  will  be  done  in  the GMT timezone.  Previously, Date::Manip would simply fail to load.
           Based on a report by Kent Fredric (RT 123229).

       Fixed Makefile.PL
           The list of what what is provided did not include the path to the file providing each  module.   I've
           fixed the Makefile.PL as well as the META files.  Graham Knop (GitHub #13)

       Deprecation of Date::Manip 5.xx tests
           By  default,  the  Date::Manip 5.xx tests will no longer run.  Changes to the timezone data can cause
           failures.  Since Date::Manip 5.xx is no longer supported in any way, these tests will no  longer  run
           on a system where 6.xx can be run.  Richard Jelinek.

       Deprecation of TZ postponed
           The  deprecation  of the TZ variable has been postponed to March 2017.  I decided that 1 year was not
           enough notice (especially since not everyone will have updated Date::Manip since March 2015 when  the

       <b>Added</b> <b>date</b> <b>ranges</b> <b>on</b> <b>unmodified</b> <b>dates</b> <b>in</b> <b>Recur</b>
           The date range can now be specified for either the fully modified dates,  or  the  unmodified  dates.
           This   will   make   it   easier   to   work   with   holidays   in   some   instances.    Based   on
           &lt;<a href="http://perlmonks.org/">http://perlmonks.org/</a>?node_id=1148735&gt;.

       <b>Added</b> <b>IWn</b> <b>and</b> <b>NWn</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>modifiers</b>
           Based on &lt;<a href="http://perlmonks.org/">http://perlmonks.org/</a>?node_id=1148735&gt;.

       <b>(!)</b> <b>Reworked</b> <b>holidays</b> <b>slightly</b>
           Previously, every line in the Holidays section defined a unique holiday.  Now,  the  names  determine
           the list of holidays.

           It  is  not  allowed  to  have  two  separate holidays named exactly the same.  It IS allowed to have
           complex holidays that require two (or more) lines in the Holidays section to define them completely.

           Based on &lt;<a href="http://perlmonks.org/">http://perlmonks.org/</a>?node_id=1148735&gt;.

       Changes suggested by perlcritic
           Played with perlcritic and made a few minor changes based on it's suggestions.  I doubt  I  will  use
           perlcritic significantly.

       <b>(!)</b> <b>Date::Manip::Delta::value</b> <b>now</b> <b>returns</b> <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> <b>string</b>
           If a delta has an error, or no valid delta in it, the value method returns an empty string instead of
           undef.   This  is  to  be  consistent with the Date::Manip::Date::value method which returns an empty
           string.

       Bug fixes
           Fixed a bug where date/delta calculations with deltas that are too large was not  working  correctly.
           They now set an error condition and fail.  Jared Selengut (RT 105737)

           Fixed a bug introduced by the previous patch and luckily discovered pre-release by Tom Wyant.

           Fixed code that produced a warning in 5.22.0.  Tom Wyant

       Improved DM6 ParseDate and ParseDateString
           Added @opts argument.  Based on report by Vitaly Shupak (RT 105622).

       Time zone fixes
           Newest zoneinfo data (tzdata 2015f)

           Now uses <a href="file:/etc/localtime">/etc/localtime</a> as a method to determine the local timezone.  Patch supplied by Tom Wyant (RT
           105159) (modified by me).  The patch uses some code derived from DateTime::TimeZone .

           Clearer message when the date is not valid in the timezone.

       Test fixes
           Added  a  number  of  new  tests  based on Devel::Cover.  Over the next several releases, I intend to
           continue to add tests until coverage is 100%.

           Problems were reported on several OSes by people unable to install Date::Manip (and  other  modules).
           It  turns  out  that  the  version  of tar distributed by my linux distro (OpenSuSE) uses the 'posix'
           format instead of the traditional 'gnu' format by default.  This causes problems for some versions of
           tar.  I have had reports from OSX, Windows, and  SunOS.   Future  versions  of  Date::Manip  will  be
           explicitly distributed in the 'gnu' tar archive format.

           Date::Manip parse a unix timestamp' thread).

       Added PeriodTimeSep config variable.
           This allows you to use a period as a time separator.  Ed Avis

       Holidays can be used as date strings
           You  can  now  parse  a  holiday  name  in  the  Date::Manip::Date::parse   method.    For   example,
           parse('Christmas').  Requested by Abigail.

       More flexibility in parsing timezones with both offset and abbrev
           If  you  include  both the offset and abbreviation in the timezone portion of a date, the parenthesis
           around the abbreviation are now optional, so you can parse both:

           Much of the delta code was reworked.

           The  constraint  that  a  day is treated as 24 hours was removed (by adding the concept of semi-exact
           deltas) to better handle daylight saving time calculations.

           Made cosmetic changes to which signs will be included in a delta to make the  deltas  more  readable.
           Signs which are the same as the next higher field will be omitted, even if they cross set boundaries.

           Added support for non-normalized deltas.  See the $no_normalize option for the parse and set methods.

           Removed limitations on subtract=2 not working with business calculations.

           Thanks  to discussion on perlmonks, and RT 65774 that prompted me to do this.  I'd been wanting to do
           it for some time, but the discussion on perlmonks made me realize that this needed to be much  higher

           The zoneinfo data includes rules more than 20 years in the future, so we now store 30 years of future
           dates instead of 20 to catch these rules.

           When parsing the timezone portion of the date, timezone abbreviations now take higher precedence than
           zone  names (since that is how timezone information is typically specified).  That only impacts dates
           where the a timezone name is the same as an abbreviation, such as 'CET'.

           Previously, a date with CET in it was interpreted as in the CET timezone.  Now it is  interpreted  as
           in a timezone with the CET abbreviation.

       Better handling of undef in DM6
           The  date/delta  parsing routines in DM6 will now handle an undef argument without issuing a warning.

           Fixed  the  'env'  method  of  determining  the local time zone to allow the value to be an offset of

           Zinser.

           Removed the SYS$TIMEZONE_RULE method from VMS since the value stored there  is  not  the  name  of  a

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>6.20</b> <b>(2010-12-01)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>(*)</b> <b>(!)</b> <b>Reworked</b> <b>recurrences</b>
           Recurrences were reworked in a (slightly) backward incompatible way to improve their usefulness  (and
           to make them conform to the expected results). Most recurrences will work the same as previously, but
           a few will differ. Most of this was suggested by Jay Jacobs.

           A  recurring event is now calculated relative to the base date, NOT relative to a previous event. For
           example, if a recurrence occurs every month, and the base date was Jan 31, then previously, recurring
           events would have been (in a non-leap year):

              <a href="../man0/D.0.html">D</a>(0)                   = Jan 31
              <a href="../man1/D.1.html">D</a>(1)  = <a href="../man0/D.0.html">D</a>(0) + 1 month = Feb 28
              <a href="../man2/D.2.html">D</a>(2)  = <a href="../man1/D.1.html">D</a>(1) + 1 month = Mar 28
              ...

           The new behavior is:

              <a href="../man0/D.0.html">D</a>(0)                       = Jan 31
              <a href="../man1/D.1.html">D</a>(1)  = <a href="../man0/D.0.html">D</a>(0) + 1*(1 month) = Feb 28
              <a href="../man2/D.2.html">D</a>(2)  = <a href="../man0/D.0.html">D</a>(0) + 2*(1 month) = Mar 31
              ...

           Previously, if a base date were not specified, it was not determined from the date  range.  Now,  the
           start date of the date range acts as the base date.

           The meaning of the base date has changed slightly. It is much more meaningful and useful now.

           Added iterator functions.  Daniel LaLiberte

           The RecurNumFudgeDays variable is no longer used and is deprecated.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>6.10</b> <b>(2010-04-29)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>(*)</b> <b>Combined</b> <b>5.xx</b> <b>and</b> <b>6.xx</b> <b>releases</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>distribution</b>
           Because the automatic module management tools cpan/cpanp would try to upgrade Date::Manip to the most
           recent  version,  and  the  most recent version will only work if perl 5.10.0 or higher is installed,
           both the 5.xx and 6.xx releases are now combined into a single distribution.

           This is described more fully in the Date::Manip::Problems document.

       <b>(!)</b> <b>Zones</b> <b>specified</b> <b>by</b> <b>offset</b>
           In all operations involving time zones, the time zone must be determined.  By default, it would  take
           all  of  the  information  available  (date, ISDST, etc.) and determine the most likely time zone. It
           would take every time zone that matched each piece of information, starting with those  that  matched
           in a standard time followed by those that matched in a daylight saving time.

           When  zones  are  specified by an offset, a standard time would always match since there are standard
           time zones that match all year long (the military time zones A-Z and the standard time zones  of  the
           form Etc/GMT+01). As a result, a daylight saving time match would never occur.

           Since  (if  the  date falls during a daylight saving time period) you usually want to use a time zone
           that has that offset in daylight saving time, the default is now to check daylight saving time  zones
           first, followed by standard times.

           See the Date::Manip::TZ manual (under the zone method) for more information.

           In  Date::Manip  5.xx,  the  %z  format  in UnixDate printed the offset in the form -0500. In 6.00, I
           changed that to -05:00:00, but this broke RFC 822 compliance.

           I've changed %z back to -0500, and introduced a new format (%N) which returns -05:00:00.

           Incidentally, this is the LAST unused letter, so I am  now  going  to  have  to  either  stop  adding
           formats,  or  add  some  extended format syntax. Not sure yet which, but this may involve a backwards
           incompatible change in the future.

       Additional credits
           I  have received many suggestions over time which were automatically handled during the 6.00 rewrite.
           Although the changes weren't made because of the suggestions specifically, I  wanted  to  acknowledge
           them since I appreciate the suggestions.

           I believe the first person to suggest writing Date::Manip as an OO module was Eduard Derksen.

           Added $subtract to calculation routines. First suggested by Steve Berlage.

           Parsing will skip some date/time formats if requested. This was first suggested by Eduard Derksen.

           It has been suggested several times to support multiple languages, multiple config files, or multiple
           sets  of Date_Init options. These suggestions (by Meng Fang, Ed Avis, Christian Campbell, and perhaps
           others) were at the back of my mind as I developed the Date::Manip::Base class.

           The  regular  expressions  are  all  i18n  friendly  in  anticipation  of  much  better  support  for
           localization. First suggested by Alex Kapranoff.

           Parsing a date ('today', 'Monday') gives a time of '00:00:00'. Suggested by Mark Aitchison.

           Working  with  fractional  days  was  suggested  by  Peter  van  Hardenberg.   This is implemented in
           Date::Manip::Base::day_of_year method.
