</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Date::Manip::Migration5to6 - how to upgrade from 5.xx to 6.00

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       When upgrading from Date::Manip 5.xx to 6.00, a few changes may be necessary to your scripts.

       The Date::Manip::Changes5to6 document lists in more detail the ways in which Date::Manip changed, but
       very few of these actually entail changes to your script.

       It should be noted that once the changes are made to your script, it will no longer run correctly in
       5.xx.

</pre><h4><b>NECESSARY</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SUGGESTED</b> <b>CHANGES</b></h4><pre>
       The following changes are necessary, or strongly suggested:

       <b>Reading</b> <b>config</b> <b>files</b> <b>with</b> <b>Date_Init</b>
           If  you  use  Date_Init  to read any config files (if you do business mode calculations, you probably
           do), you should remove all of the following config variables from your call to Date_Init:

              GlobalCnf=FILE
              PersonalCnf=FILE
              PathSep=*
              IgnoreGlobalCnf=*
              PersonalCnfPath=*

           and replace them with:

              ConfigFile=FILE

           where FILE is now the full path to a config file. Also, the ConfigFile argument should be  the  first
           argument in Date_Init.

       <b>Date_ConvTZ</b>
           The Date_ConvTZ function has changed. It should now take 3 arguments:

              $date = Date_ConvTZ($date,$from,$to);

           If  $from  is  not given, it defaults to the local time zone. If $to is not given, it defaults to the
           local time zone.

           The date is converted from the $from time zone into the $to time zone. Both should be any  time  zone
           (or alias) supported by Date::Manip.

           The old $errlevel argument is no longer handled.

       <b>ConvTZ</b> <b>and</b> <b>TZ</b> <b>config</b> <b>variables</b>
           If  you  use either the ConvTZ or TZ config variables, you should replace them with either SetDate or
           ForceDate. See the Date::Manip::Config document for information.

           The TZ variable will continue to work until Dec 2015 at which point it will be removed.

       <b>Other</b> <b>deprecated</b> <b>config</b> <b>variables</b>
           The following config variables have been deprecated, but will continue to function (though they  will
           be removed at a future date):

              TZ           (removed Mar 2016)

           The  following  variables  have  been  removed.  If  you use any of them, you may need to modify your
           scripts:

              IntCharSet
              GlobalCnf
              PersonalCnf
              PathSep
              IgnoreGlobalCnf
              PersonalCnfPath
              ConvTZ
              Internal
              TodayIsMidnight
              DeltaSigns
              UpdateCurrTZ
              ResetWorkdDay

       <b>today,</b> <b>yesterday,</b> <b>tomorrow</b>
           If you parse the strings "today", "yesterday", or "tomorrow" in order to get  the  time  now,  or  24
           hours in the past/future, this will no longer work.  These strings now refer strictly to the date (so
           "today" is the current day at midnight, "yesterday" is the previous day at midnight, etc.).

           To  get  the  time  now, 24 hours ago, or 24 hours in the future, you would need to parse the strings
           "now", "-24:00:00", or "+24:00:00" respectively.

       <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>use</b> <b>Memoize</b>
           In 5.xx, it was documented that you could use the module Memoize to speed up Date::Manip,  especially
           when sorting dates.

           This  information  is  no  longer accurate. Using Memoize in conjunction with Date::Manip should have
           little impact on performance, and may lead to incorrect results,  especially  if  you  change  config
           variables.

           Please refer to "GENERAL CHANGES" in Date::Manip::Changes5to6 for more information.

       If  you  find  other instances where it is necessary to modify your script, please email me so that I can
       add that information to this document.
