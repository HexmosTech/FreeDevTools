       hex - Encoding "hex"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       package require <b>Tcl</b>  <b>?8.2?</b>

       package require <b>Trf</b>  <b>?2.1.3?</b>

       <b>hex</b> ?<u>options...</u>? ?<u>data</u>?

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  command  <b>hex</b>  is  one  of  several  data encodings provided by the package <b>trf</b>. See <b>trf-intro</b> for an
       overview of the whole package.

       This encoding transforms every byte in  the  input  into  a  sequence  of  2  characters  containing  the
       hexadecimal representation of the byte.  For example

            % hex -mode encode Z
            5A

       <b>hex</b> ?<u>options...</u>? ?<u>data</u>?

              <b>-mode</b> <b>encode</b>|<b>decode</b>
                     This option has to be present and is always understood by the encoding.

                     For  <u>immediate</u>  mode  the  argument  value specifies the operation to use.  For an <u>attached</u>
                     encoding it specifies the operation to use for <u>writing</u>. Reading will automatically use  the
                     reverse  operation.   See  section  <b>IMMEDIATE</b> <b>versus</b> <b>ATTACHED</b> for explanations of these two
                     terms.

                     Beyond the argument values listed above all unique abbreviations are recognized too.

                     <b>Encode</b> converts from arbitrary (most likely binary) data into the described representation,
                     <b>decode</b> does the reverse .

              <b>-attach</b> <u>channel</u>
                     The  presence/absence  of  this  option  determines  the  main  operation   mode   of   the
                     transformation.

                     If  present  the  transformation will be stacked onto the <u>channel</u> whose handle was given to
                     the option and run in <u>attached</u> mode. More about this in section <b>IMMEDIATE</b> <b>versus</b> <b>ATTACHED</b>.

                     If the option is absent the transformation is used in <u>immediate</u> mode and the options listed
                     below are recognized. More about this in section <b>IMMEDIATE</b> <b>versus</b> <b>ATTACHED</b>.

              <b>-in</b> <u>channel</u>
                     This options is legal if and only if the transformation  is  used  in  <u>immediate</u>  mode.  It
                     provides the handle of the channel the data to transform has to be read from.

                     If  the transformation is in <u>immediate</u> mode and this option is absent the data to transform
                     is expected as the last argument to the transformation.

              <b>-out</b> <u>channel</u>
                     This options is legal if and only if the transformation  is  used  in  <u>immediate</u>  mode.  It
                     provides the handle of the channel the generated transformation result is written to.

                     If  the transformation is in <u>immediate</u> mode and this option is absent the generated data is
                     returned as the result of the command itself.

</pre><h4><b>IMMEDIATE</b> <b>VERSUS</b> <b>ATTACHED</b></h4><pre>
       The transformation distinguishes between two main ways of using it. These are the <u>immediate</u> and  <u>attached</u>
       operation modes.

       For  the  <u>attached</u>  mode  the  option  <b>-attach</b>  is  used to associate the transformation with an existing
       channel. During the execution of the command no transformation  is  performed,  instead  the  channel  is
       changed  in  such  a  way,  that  from  then  on  all  data written to or read from it passes through the
       transformation and is modified by it according to the definition above.  This attachment can  be  revoked
       by  executing  the  command  <b>unstack</b>  for  the chosen channel. This is the only way to do this at the Tcl
       level.

       In the second mode, which  can  be  detected  by  the  absence  of  option  <b>-attach</b>,  the  transformation
       immediately  takes  data  from either its commandline or a channel, transforms it, and returns the result
       either as result of the command, or writes it into a channel.  The mode  is  named  after  the  immediate
       nature of its execution.

       Where  the  data  is taken from, and delivered to, is governed by the presence and absence of the options
       <b>-in</b> and <b>-out</b>.  It should be noted that this ability to immediately read from and/or write to a channel is
       an historic artifact which was introduced at the beginning of Trf's life when Tcl version 7.6 was current
       as this and earlier versions have trouble to deal with  \0  characters  embedded  into  either  input  or
       output.
