</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SRU::Response::Term - A class for representing terms in a Scan response

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A SRU::Response::Term object bundles up information about a single term contained in a
       SRU::Response::Scan object. A scan object can contain multiple term objects.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new()</b>
       THe constructor which you must at least pass the value parameter:

           my $term = SRU::Response::Term-&gt;new( term =&gt; "Foo Fighter" );

       In addition you can pass the numberOfRecords, displayTerm, whereInList, and extraTermData parameters, or
       set them separately with their accessors.

   <b>value()</b>
       The term exactly as it appears in the index. This term should be able to be sent in a query as is to
       retrieve the records it derives from.

   <b>numberOfRecords()</b>
       The number of records which would be matched if the index in the request's scanClause was searched with
       the term in the 'value' field.

   <b>displayTerm()</b>
       A string to display to the end user in place of the term itself. For example this might add back in
       stopwords which do not appear in the index, or diacritics which have been normalised.

   <b>whereInList()</b>
       A flag to indicate the position of the term within the complete term list. It must be one of the
       following values: 'first' (the first term), 'last' (the last term), 'only' (the only term) or 'inner'
       (any other term).

   <b>extraTermData()</b>
       Additional profile specific information. More details are available in the extensions section.
