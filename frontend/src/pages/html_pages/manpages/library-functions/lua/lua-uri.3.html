</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       lua-uri - Lua module for manipulating URIs

</pre><h4><b>Loading</b> <b>the</b> <b>module</b></h4><pre>
       The URI module doesn't alter any global variables when it loads, so you can decide what name you want to
       use to access it.  You will probably want to load it like this:

           local URI = require "uri"

       You can use a variable called something other than "URI" if you'd like, or you could assign the table
       returned by "require" to a global variable.  In this documentation we'll assume you're using a variable
       called "URI".

</pre><h4><b>Parsing,</b> <b>validating</b> <b>and</b> <b>normalizing</b> <b>URIs</b></h4><pre>
       When you create a URI object, the string you supply is checked to make sure it conforms to the
       appropriate standards.  If everything is OK, the new object will be returned, otherwise nil and an error
       message will be returned.  You can convert any errors into Lua exceptions using the "assert" function.

           local URI = require "URI"

           local uri = assert(URI:new("<a href="http://example.com/foo">http://example.com/foo</a>"))

           -- In this case, these will print the original string.
           -- They are both the same.
           print(tostring(uri))
           print(uri:uri())

       You can extract individual parts of the URI with various accessor methods:

           print(uri:scheme())     -- http
           print(uri:host())       -- example.com
           print(uri:path())       -- /foo

       Some URIs will be 'normalized' automatically to produce an equivalent canonical version.  Nothing will be
       changed which would affect how the URI will be interpreted.  For example:

           local uri = assert(URI:new("HTTP://EXAMPLE.COM:80/FOO"))
           print(tostring(uri))     -- <a href="http://example.com/FOO">http://example.com/FOO</a>

       In this case the scheme and hostname were both converted to lowercase (but not the path part, because
       that's case sensitive).  The port number was also removed because port 80 is the default anyway for HTTP
       URIs.

       If you just want to make sure a URI is correct, but without throwing an exception, use code like this:

           local uri, err = URI:new(uri_to_test)

           if uri then
               print("valid, normalized to " .. tostring(uri))
           else
               print("invalid, error message is " .. err)
           end

       (Note that many invalid URIs will get processed as relative URI references, so if you're expecting an
       absolute URI it's also a good idea to check that the "is_relative" method returns false.)

</pre><h4><b>Cloning</b> <b>URIs</b></h4><pre>
       To make a copy of a URI object, pass it to the constructor:

           local original = URI:new("<a href="http://www/foo">http://www/foo</a>")
           local copy = URI:new(original)

       The two objects will contain the same information, but can be changed independently.

</pre><h4><b>Relative</b> <b>URIs</b></h4><pre>
       A relative URI reference is not a complete URI.  It doesn't have a scheme, so it doesn't really mean
       anything until it is resolved against an absolute URI.  For this reason, when you create a URI object
       from a relative URI, it will belong to the special class "uri._relative".  There is very little you can
       do with a relative URI object other than get and set its path, query string, and fragment identifier.

       Relative URI objects can be created in the same way as absolute ones:

           local uri = assert(URI:new("../path?query#fragment"))
           print(uri:is_relative())    -- true
           print(uri._NAME)            -- uri._relative

       There are two ways to resolve a relative URI reference against an absolute URI to get another absolute
       URI.  One is to create a new URI object, passing the base URI as a second argument to the constructor:

           local rel  = assert(URI:new("../quux.html"))
           local base = assert(URI:new("<a href="http://example.com/foo/bar/">http://example.com/foo/bar/</a>"))
           local abs  = assert(URI:new(rel, base))
           print(tostring(abs))    -- <a href="http://example.com/foo/quux.html">http://example.com/foo/quux.html</a>

       You can also do this by passing strings to "new", instead of objects:

           local abs = assert(URI:new("../quux.html",
                                      "<a href="http://example.com/foo/bar/">http://example.com/foo/bar/</a>"))
           print(tostring(abs))    -- <a href="http://example.com/foo/quux.html">http://example.com/foo/quux.html</a>

       Alternatively, a URI object containing a relative URI can be made absolute without creating a new object
       using the "resolve" method:

           local uri  = assert(URI:new("../quux.html"))
           local base = assert(URI:new("<a href="http://example.com/foo/bar/">http://example.com/foo/bar/</a>"))
           uri:resolve(base)
           print(tostring(uri))    -- <a href="http://example.com/foo/quux.html">http://example.com/foo/quux.html</a>

       The reverse process can be carried out with the "relativize" method, creating a relative URI from an
       absolute one, where the relative URI can be later resolved against a particular base URI:

           local uri  = assert(URI:new("<a href="http://example.com/foo/quux.html">http://example.com/foo/quux.html</a>"))
           local base = assert(URI:new("<a href="http://example.com/foo/bar/">http://example.com/foo/bar/</a>"))
           uri:relativize(base)
           print(tostring(uri))    -- ../quux.html

       It is possible for a relative URI to have an authority part, although this is very rare in practice.  It
       is unlikely that you'll ever need to do this, but you can create a URI like this:

           local uri = assert(URI:new("//example.com/path"))

</pre><h4><b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
       This is a complete list of the methods you can call on a generic "URI" object once created by calling
       "new".  Some URIs are created in more specific classes (listed in the <u>URI</u> <u>schemes</u> section), which may
       have additional methods.  Arguments shown in square brackets below are optional.

       Note that all the accessor methods, like "path" and "uri", can be used just to return the current value
       (if they are called without an argument), or can set a new value while returning the old value.  Passing
       nil as the argument is generally different from not passing an argument at all, or to passing an empty
       string.

       <b>uri:default_port()</b>
           Returns  the  default port used for this type of URI when no port number is supplied in the authority
           part.  This will be nil if the standard for the URI's current scheme doesn't specify a default  port,
           or if the scheme is one which this library doesn't have any special understanding of.

               local uri = assert(URI:new("<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>:123/"))
               print(uri:default_port())   -- 80

       uri:eq(other)
           Returns  true  if the two URI objects contain the same URI.  "other" can also be a string, which will
           be converted to a URI object (in order for the normalization to be done).

           This can also be called as a stand-alone function if you don't know whether either URI is  an  object
           or a string.  For example:

               print(URI.eq("<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>",
                            "HTTP://EXAMPLE.COM/"))

           If  either  value is a string which isn't a valid URI, this will throw an exception.  It will however
           accept relative URIs, and they will be compared as normal.  A relative  URI  is  never  equal  to  an
           absolute one.

           There  is  no less-than comparison function, as URIs don't have any particular ordering.  If you want
           to sort URI objects you're best bet is probably just to compare the string versions:

               function urisort (a, b)
                   return a:uri() &lt; b:uri()
               end

               table.sort(t, urisort)

       uri:fragment([newvalue])
           Returns the current fragment part of the URI (the part after the "#" character), or nil  if  the  URI
           has no fragment part.  Note that an empty fragment (zero characters long) is different from one which
           is completely missing.

           If  "newvalue"  is  supplied,  changes the fragment to the new value, percent encoding any characters
           which would not be valid in a fragment part.  Any percent encoding already done on the string will be
           left in place (not double encoded).  If "newvalue" is nil then any existing fragment will be removed.

           The syntax of fragments are meaningful only for particular media types of resources, so there  is  no
           special behaviour for different URI schemes.

       uri:host([newvalue])
           Get  and  set  the  host  part of the authority in a URI.  This can be a domain name, an IPv4 address
           (four numbers separated by dots), or an  IPv6  address  (which  must  include  the  enclosing  square
           brackets used in URIs).

           When  setting  a  new  host,  the  value  is normalized to lowercase.  An invalid value will cause an
           exception to be thrown.  The value can be an empty string to indicate the default host.

           Setting the value to nil will cause the host to be  removed  altogether,  leaving  the  URI  with  no
           authority  component.   This  will throw an exception if there is a userinfo or port component in the
           URI, because it is impossible to represent a URI with no host when there is an authority component.

           Some URI schemes may throw an exception when setting the host to nil or the empty string, and  others
           when  setting  it  to  anything  other  than  nil,  if  those  schemes  require or disallow authority
           components.

       <b>uri:init()</b>
           This method is called internally to make a URI object belong to the right class and  do  any  scheme-
           specific  validation  an  normalization.   It  is  only  of interest if you want to write a new "uri"
           subclass for particular types of URIs.

           The implementation in the "uri" class itself changes the class of the object to the  one  appropriate
           to  the  scheme  (if there is a more specific class available).  It also removes the port number from
           the authority component if it is unnecessary because the scheme  defines  it  as  the  default  port.
           Finally, if there is a more specific class available it calls the "init" method in that.

           "init"  is called after the URI has been split into components according to the generic syntax, so it
           can use the accessor methods to get at them.  It should return the same values as "new",  either  the
           new URI object (the object it was called on), or nil and an error message.

       <b>uri:is_relative()</b>
           Returns  true  if this is a relative URI reference, false otherwise.  All relative URIs belong to the
           class "uri._relative".  All the other URI classes are for absolute URIs.

       uri:path([newvalue])
           Get or set the path component of the URI.  Throws an exception if the new value is not valid  in  the
           context of the rest of the URI.

               local uri = assert(URI:new("<a href="http://example.com/foo">http://example.com/foo</a>"))
               local old = uri:path("/bar/")
               print(old)          -- /foo
               print(uri:path())   -- /bar/

           When a new path value is supplied, it can already be percent encoded, but any characters which aren't
           allowed are encoded as well.  Percent characters are not encoded themselves, because they are assumed
           to  be  part  of the existing encoding.  The existing percent encoding is normalized, and any invalid
           encoding will cause an exception.

           There are certain paths which cannot be expressed in the URI syntax.  A path  which  does  not  start
           with  a "/" character (unless it's completely empty) cannot be represented when there is an authority
           component, so this will cause an exception to be thrown.  A path which starts with "//" when there is
           no authority component would be misinterpreted, so the second slash is percent encoded.

           Some URI schemes may impose further restrictions on what is allowed in a path, so other  path  values
           may cause exceptions in certain cases.

       uri:port([newvalue])
           Get or set the port number in a URI.  The value returned is always an integer number or nil.

           If  "newvalue"  is  supplied  it should be a non-negative integer number, or a string containing only
           digits, or nil to remove any existing port number.  An exception is thrown if it is an invalid value,
           or if the URI scheme doesn't allow port numbers to be specified.  If there is currently no  authority
           part in the URI, then an empty host will be added to create one.

           If  the  port  number  is  the  default  for  a  URI scheme (the same as the number returned from the
           "default_port" method), then the "port" method will return that number, but the number won't actually
           be shown in the URI when it is represented as a string, because it would be redundant.   Setting  the
           port number to nil has the same effect as setting it to the default port number.

       uri:query([newvalue])
           Get or set the query part of a URI.

           If "newvalue" is supplied it should be the new string, or nil to remove any existing query part.  The
           query  part  can  be  an  empty  string, which is different from it not being present at all (the "?"
           character will still be included to indicate that there is a query part, even if it is  not  followed
           by  anything else).  Any characters which would not be valid in a query part will be percent encoded,
           but any percent encoding already done on the string will be left in place (not double encoded).

           The base-class implementation of this  method  never  throws  exceptions,  but  some  scheme-specific
           classes may throw exceptions if they impose constraints on the syntax of query parts.

       uri:resolve(base)
           Given  an  object representing a relative URI, resolve it against the base URI "base" (which can be a
           URI object or string) and update the "uri" object to contain an absolute URI.

           Has no effect if "uri" is already an absolute URI.  Throws an exception if "base" is not an  absolute
           URI, or if the new URI formed by combining them would be invalid for the given scheme.

           See also the section <u>Relative</u> <u>URIs</u> and the "uri:relativize(base)" method.

       uri:scheme([newvalue])
           Get  and  set  the  scheme of the URI.  Altering the scheme of an existing URI is very unlikely to be
           useful.

           Throws an exception if "newvalue" is nil or not a valid scheme, or if the rest  of  the  URI  is  not
           valid  when  interpreted  with the new scheme.  After calling this method the class of the object may
           have been changed, if the old class is not appropriate for the new value.

       uri:relativize(base)
           If possible, update the absolute URI "uri" to contain a  relative  URI  which,  when  resolved  again
           against  "base",  will yield the original URI value.  This doesn't return anything, just modifies the
           object.

           Has no effect if "uri" is already relative, or if there is no way to create an  appropriate  relative
           URI  (so  the  URI  will  remain  absolute  for example if "base" has a different scheme from "uri").
           Throws an exception if "base" is not absolute.

           This method will never result in a network-path reference (a relative URI which includes an authority
           part).  In cases where that would be possible the value in "uri" will be left  as  an  absolute  URI,
           which is less likely to cause problems.

           See also the section <u>Relative</u> <u>URIs</u> and the "uri:resolve(base)" method.

       uri:uri([newvalue])
           Returns the URI value as a string.  The return value is the same as you'll get from "tostring(uri)".

           If  an  argument  is  supplied,  this  replaces  the  URI  in  the "uri" object with a different one.
           "newvalue" must be a complete new URI or relative URI reference in a string, or a URI object.

           This is equivalent to creating a new URI object by calling "URI:new", except that instead of creating
           a new object the existing object is updated with the new information.  It is  also  not  possible  to
           pass a base URI to the "uri" method.

           Throws  an  exception  if  "newvalue"  is nil or if there is any error in parsing the new URI string.
           After calling this method the class of the object may have been changed, if  the  old  class  is  not
           appropriate for the new value.

       uri:userinfo([newvalue])
           Get or set the userinfo part of the URI.  If "newvalue" is supplied then it is expected to be percent
           encoded  already.   Percent  encoding is normalized.  An exception will be thrown if the new value is
           invalid, or if the URI scheme does not allow a userinfo part (for example if it is an HTTP URI).   If
           there is currently no authority part in the URI, then an empty host will be added to create one.

           If "newvalue" is nil then any existing userinfo part is removed.

</pre><h4><b>URI</b> <b>schemes</b></h4><pre>
       The  following Lua modules provide classes which implement extra validation and normalization, or provide
       extra methods, for URIs which specific schemes:

       uri.data
       uri.file
       uri.ftp
       uri.http and uri.https
       uri.pop
       uri.rtsp and uri.rtspu
       uri.telnet
       uri.urn

</pre><h4><b>Other</b> <b>modules</b></h4><pre>
       Other Lua modules provide additional functionality used in the library, or act as base  classes  for  the
       scheme-specific classes:

       uri._login
           Baseclass  for  URI  schemes which use a username and password in their userinfo part, separated by a
           colon (for example FTP).

       uri._util
           Utility functions used by the rest of the library.  Contains  useful  "uri_encode"  and  "uri_decode"
           functions which might be useful elsewhere.

</pre><h4><b>References</b></h4><pre>
       The parsing of URI syntax is based primarily on "RFC 3986".
