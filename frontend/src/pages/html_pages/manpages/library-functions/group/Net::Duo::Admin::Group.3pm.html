</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Duo::Admin::Group - Representation of a Duo group

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $decoded_json = get_json();
           my $group = Net::Duo::Admin::Group-&gt;new($decoded_json);
           say $group-&gt;desc;

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.14 or later and the modules HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response (part of HTTP::Message), JSON, LWP
       (also known as libwww-perl), Perl6::Slurp, Sub::Install, and URI::Escape (part of URI), all of which are
       available from CPAN.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A Net::Duo::Admin::Group object is a Perl representation of a Duo group as returned by the Duo Admin API,
       usually via the <b>groups()</b> method or nested in a user returned by the <b>users()</b> method.  It contains various
       information about a group, including the privileges it controls.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       create(DUO, DATA)
           Creates  a  new  group  in Duo and returns the resulting user as a new Net::Duo::Admin::Group object.
           DUO is the Net::Duo object that should be used to perform the creation.  DATA is  a  reference  to  a
           hash with the following keys:

           name
               The name of the group to create.  Required.

           desc
               The description of the group.  Optional.

           push_enabled
               Whether   users  in  the  group  will  be  able  to  use  Duo  Push  to  authenticate.   See  the
               "<b>push_enabled()</b>" method below for more information.  Optional.

           sms_enabled
               Whether users in the group will be able to use SMS  to  authenticate.   See  the  "<b>sms_enabled()</b>"
               method below for more information.  Optional.

           status
               The  group's  authentication  status.   See  the "<b>status()</b>" method below for the possible values.
               Optional.

           voice_enabled
               Whether users in the group will be  able  to  use  voice  callbacks  to  authenticate.   See  the
               "<b>voice_enabled()</b>" method below for more information.  Optional.

       new(DUO, DATA)
           Creates  a  new  Net::Duo::Admin::Group object from a full data set.  DUO is the Net::Duo object that
           should be used for any further actions on this object.  DATA should be the data structure returned by
           the Duo REST API for a single user, after JSON decoding.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>ACTION</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>delete()</b>
           Delete this group from Duo.  After successful completion of  this  call,  the  Net::Duo::Admin::Group
           object  should  be  considered  read-only, since no further changes to the object can be meaningfully
           sent to Duo.

       <b>json()</b>
           Convert the data stored in the object to JSON and return the  results.   The  resulting  JSON  should
           match the JSON that one would get back from the Duo web service when retrieving the same object (plus
           any  changes  made  locally  to  the  object  via  set_*()  methods).  This is primarily intended for
           debugging dumps or for passing Duo objects to other systems via further JSON APIs.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>desc()</b>
           The description of the group.

       <b>group_id()</b>
           The unique ID of this group as generated by Duo on group creation.

       <b>name()</b>
           The name of this group.

       <b>push_enabled()</b>
           If true, users in the group will be able to use Duo Push to authenticate.  If  false,  users  in  the
           group  will not be able to use Duo Push to authenticate.  Note that this setting has no effect if Duo
           Push is disabled globally.

       <b>sms_enabled()</b>
           If true, users in the group will be able to use SMS passcodes to authenticate.  If  false,  users  in
           the  group  will  not  be  able  to use SMS passcodes to authenticate.  Note that this setting has no
           effect if SMS passcodes are disabled globally.

       <b>status()</b>
           One of the following values:

           "active"
               The users in this group must complete secondary authentication.

           "bypass"
               The  users  in  this  group  will  bypass  secondary  authentication  after  completing   primary
               authentication.

           "disabled"
               The users in this group will not be able to authenticate.

       <b>voice_enabled()</b>
           If  true,  users in the group will be able to authenticate with a voice callback.  If false, users in
           the group will not be able to authenticate with a voice callback.  Note  that  this  setting  has  no
           effect if voice callback is disabled globally.
