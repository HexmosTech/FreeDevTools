</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::KDBX::Group - A KDBX database group

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.906

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A group in a KDBX database is a type of object that can contain entries and other groups.

       There is also some metadata associated with a group. Each group in a database is identified uniquely by a
       UUID. An entry can also have an icon associated with it, and there are various timestamps. Take a look at
       the attributes to see what's available.

       A <b>File::KDBX::Group</b> is a subclass of File::KDBX::Object. View its documentation to see other attributes
       and methods available on groups.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>name</b>
       The human-readable name of the group.

   <b>notes</b>
       Free form text string associated with the group.

   <b>is_expanded</b>
       Whether or not subgroups are visible when listed for user selection.

   <b>default_auto_type_sequence</b>
       The default auto-type keystroke sequence, inheritable by entries and subgroups.

   <b>enable_auto_type</b>
       Whether or not the entry is eligible to be matched for auto-typing, inheritable by entries and subgroups.

   <b>enable_searching</b>
       Whether or not entries within the group can show up in search results, inheritable by subgroups.

   <b>last_top_visible_entry</b>
       The UUID of the entry visible at the top of the list.

   <b>entries</b>
       Array of entries contained within the group.

   <b>groups</b>
       Array of subgroups contained within the group.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>entries</b>
           \@entries = $group-&gt;entries;

       Get an array of direct child entries within a group.

   <b>all_entries</b>
           \&amp;iterator = $kdbx-&gt;all_entries(%options);

       Get an File::KDBX::Iterator over <u>entries</u> within a group. Supports the same options as "groups", plus some
       new ones:

       •   "auto_type" - Only include entries with auto-type enabled (default: false, include all)

       •   "searching" - Only include entries within groups with searching enabled (default: false, include all)

       •   "history" - Also include historical entries (default: false, include only current entries)

   <b>add_entry</b>
           $entry = $group-&gt;add_entry($entry);
           $entry = $group-&gt;add_entry(%entry_attributes);

       Add  an entry to a group. If $entry already has a parent group, it will be removed from that group before
       being added to $group.

   <b>remove_entry</b>
           $entry = $group-&gt;remove_entry($entry);
           $entry = $group-&gt;remove_entry($entry_uuid);

       Remove an entry from a group's array of entries. Returns the entry removed or "undef" if nothing removed.

   <b>groups</b>
           \@groups = $group-&gt;groups;

       Get an array of direct subgroups within a group.

   <b>all_groups</b>
           \&amp;iterator = $group-&gt;all_groups(%options);

       Get an File::KDBX::Iterator over <u>groups</u> within a groups, deeply. Options:

       •   "inclusive" - Include $group itself in the results (default: true)

       •   "algorithm" - Search algorithm, one of "ids", "bfs" or "dfs" (default: "ids")

   <b>add_group</b>
           $new_group = $group-&gt;add_group($new_group);
           $new_group = $group-&gt;add_group(%group_attributes);

       Add a group to a group. If $new_group already has a parent group, it will  be  removed  from  that  group
       before being added to $group.

   <b>remove_group</b>
           $removed_group = $group-&gt;remove_group($group);
           $removed_group = $group-&gt;remove_group($group_uuid);

       Remove  a  group  from  a  group's  array  of  subgroups. Returns the group removed or "undef" if nothing
       removed.

   <b>all_objects</b>
           \&amp;iterator = $groups-&gt;all_objects(%options);

       Get an File::KDBX::Iterator over <u>objects</u> within a  group,  deeply.  Groups  and  entries  are  considered
       objects,  so this is essentially a combination of "groups" and "entries". This won't often be useful, but
       it can be convenient for maintenance tasks. This method takes the same options as "groups" and "entries".

   <b>add_object</b>
           $new_entry = $group-&gt;add_object($new_entry);
           $new_group = $group-&gt;add_object($new_group);

       Add an object (either a File::KDBX::Entry or a  File::KDBX::Group)  to  a  group.  This  is  the  generic
       equivalent of the object forms of "add_entry" and "add_group".

   <b>remove_object</b>
           $group-&gt;remove_object($entry);
           $group-&gt;remove_object($group);

       Remove  an  object  (either a File::KDBX::Entry or a File::KDBX::Group) from a group. This is the generic
       equivalent of the object forms of "remove_entry" and "remove_group".

   <b>effective_default_auto_type_sequence</b>
           $text = $group-&gt;effective_default_auto_type_sequence;

       Get the value of "default_auto_type_sequence", if set, or get the inherited effective  default  auto-type
       sequence of the parent.

   <b>effective_enable_auto_type</b>
           $text = $group-&gt;effective_enable_auto_type;

       Get  the  value  of "enable_auto_type", if set, or get the inherited effective auto-type enabled value of
       the parent.

   <b>effective_enable_searching</b>
           $text = $group-&gt;effective_enable_searching;

       Get the value of "enable_searching", if set, or get the inherited effective searching  enabled  value  of
       the parent.

   <b>is_empty</b>
           $bool = $group-&gt;is_empty;

       Get whether or not the group is empty (has no subgroups or entries).

   <b>is_root</b>
           $bool = $group-&gt;is_root;

       Determine if a group is the root group of its connected database.

   <b>is_recycle_bin</b>
           $bool = $group-&gt;is_recycle_bin;

       Get whether or not a group is the recycle bin of its connected database.

   <b>is_entry_templates</b>
           $bool = $group-&gt;is_entry_templates;

       Get whether or not a group is the group containing entry template in its connected database.

   <b>is_last_selected</b>
           $bool = $group-&gt;is_last_selected;

       Get whether or not a group is the prior selected group of its connected database.

   <b>is_last_top_visible</b>
           $bool = $group-&gt;is_last_top_visible;

       Get whether or not a group is the latest top visible group of its connected database.

   <b>path</b>
           $string = $group-&gt;path;

       Get  a  string  representation  of  a  group's  lineage.  This  is used as the substitution value for the
       "{GROUP_PATH}" placeholder. See "Placeholders" in File::KDBX::Entry.

       For a root group, the path is simply the name of the group. For deeper groups,  the  path  is  a  period-
       separated  sequence  of  group names between the root group and $group, including $group but <u>not</u> the root
       group.  In other words, paths of deeper groups leave the root group name out.

           Database
           -&gt; Root         # path is "Root"
              -&gt; Foo       # path is "Foo"
                 -&gt; Bar    # path is "Foo.Bar"

       Yeah, it doesn't make much sense to me, either, but this matches the behavior of KeePass.

   <b>size</b>
           $size = $group-&gt;size;

       Get the size (in bytes) of a group, including the size of all subroups and entries, if any.

   <b>depth</b>
           $depth = $group-&gt;depth;

       Get the depth of a group within a database. The root group is at depth 0,  its  direct  children  are  at
       depth 1, etc. A group not in a database tree structure returns a depth of -1.
