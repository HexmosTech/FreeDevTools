</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       AGGETP - Allows a user program to get the values of a group of parameters containing one or more
       elements.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL AGGETP (TPGN,FURA,LURA)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_aggetp (char *tpgn, float *fura, int lura)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       TPGN        (an input expression of type CHARACTER) is a character string of the form 'k1/k2/ . . . kn.',
                   where  each  of  the  ki's is a keyword. The keyword k1 specifies a group of parameters, k2 a
                   subgroup of that group, k3 a subgroup of that subgroup, etc. The whole string is the name  of
                   some group of parameters the user wishes to set.

                   For  example,  'AXIS.' is the name of a 92-word group of parameters describing the four axes,
                   'AXIS/RIGHT.' is the name of a 23-word subgroup describing the right Y axis,

                        'AXIS/RIGHT/INTERSECTION.'

                   is the name of a 2-word further subgroup describing the intersection of the right Y axis with
                   the bottom of the grid window, and

                        'AXIS/RIGHT/INTERSECTION/USER.'

                   is the name of a single parameter specifying the point of intersection of the  right  Y  axis
                   with the bottom of the grid window as an X coordinate in the user coordinate system.

                   Obviously,  these  names  can  sometimes become rather long.  There are various ways in which
                   they may be shortened.  First, since the fifth and following characters of each  keyword  are
                   ignored, they may be omitted; this would shorten

                        'AXIS/RIGHT/INTERSECTION/USER.'

                   to

                        'AXIS/RIGH/INTE/USER.'

                   Even  fewer  characters  may be used, as long as no ambiguity of interpretation arises. To be
                   completely safe, use at least the first three characters of the group keyword  and  at  least
                   the  first  two  characters of each subgroup keyword; this would shorten the example above to
                   'AXI/RI/IN/US.'.  Moreover, certain group and subgroup keywords may be omitted entirely;  for
                   example,  'AXI/RI/IN/US.'  may  be  shortened  to 'RI/IN/US.'. Keywords which may be entirely
                   omitted are enclosed in brackets in the headings in the section "PARAMETERS".

                   Names may also be lengthened in various ways in order to improve  their  readability.  Blanks
                   may  be used as desired on either side of a keyword. Any sequence of characters not including
                   a slash or a period may be inserted after a keyword, separated from it by at least one blank.
                   For example, the name

                        'DASH PATTERN / CHARACTER WIDTH .'

                   is equivalent to, and considerably more meaningful than,

                        'DAS/CH.' (or even 'DASH/CHARACTER.')

       FURA        (an input array of type REAL, dimensioned LURA) contains new values for the parameters in the
                   group specified by TPGN, in the same order as they appear in the group. All  parameters  have
                   real values (because of a portability problem which arose in implementing the routines AGSETF
                   and AGSETR). Those which represent intrinsically integral quantities have a value of the form
                   "FLOAT(n)",   where   "n"  is  the  integral  quantity  being  represented.  Some  parameters
                   intrinsically take on character-string values; the real quantity stored as the value of  such
                   a  parameter  is typically an identifier allowing for later retrieval of the character string
                   from a character storage area inside Autograph. The routines AGSETC and AGGETC may be used to
                   set/get the character-string values of such parameters.

       LURA        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the length of FURA. Its  value  may  be  less  than,
                   equal  to,  or  greater than, the length of the group specified by TPGN. The number of values
                   transferred into FURA is the minimum of the two  (but  not  less  than  one).  You  may,  for
                   example, get the first two parameters of a 100-parameter group by using LURA = 2.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument description is the same as the FORTRAN argument description.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       This  routine  allows  you to retrieve the current value of Autograph parameters.  For a complete list of
       parameters available in this utility, see the autograph_params man page.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use AGGETP or c_aggetp, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably  in
       that  order.     To  get smoother curves, drawn using spline interpolation, also load libdashsmth.o.  Or,
       you can use the ncargf77 command to compile your program and load  the  above  libraries,  then,  to  get
       smoother curves, use the -dashsmth option.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       See  the  autograph  man  page  for  a  description  of all Autograph error messages and/or informational
       messages.
