</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Scalar::Defer - Lazy evaluation in Perl

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Scalar::Defer; # exports 'defer', 'lazy' and 'force'

           my ($x, $y);
           my $dv = defer { ++$x };    # a deferred value (not memoized)
           my $lv = lazy { ++$y };     # a lazy value (memoized)

           print "$dv $dv $dv"; # 1 2 3
           print "$lv $lv $lv"; # 1 1 1

           my $forced = force $dv;     # force a normal value out of $dv

           print "$forced $forced $forced"; # 4 4 4

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module exports two functions, "defer" and "lazy", for constructing values that are evaluated on
       demand.  It also exports a "force" function to force evaluation of a deferred value.

   <b>defer</b> <b>{...}</b>
       Takes a block or a code reference, and returns a deferred value.  Each time that value is demanded, the
       block is evaluated again to yield a fresh result.

   <b>lazy</b> <b>{...}</b>
       Like "defer", except the value is computed at most once.  Subsequent evaluation will simply use the
       cached result.

   <b>force</b> <b>$value</b>
       Force evaluation of a deferred value to return a normal value.  If $value was already a normal value,
       then "force" simply returns it.

   <b>is_deferred</b> <b>$value</b>
       Tells whether the argument is a deferred value or not. (Lazy values are deferred too.)

       The "is_deferred" function is not exported by default; to import it, name it explicitly in the import
       list.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Deferred values are not considered objects ("ref" on them returns 0), although you can still call methods
       on them, in which case the invocant is always the forced value.

       Unlike the "tie"-based Data::Lazy, this module operates on <u>values</u>, not <u>variables</u>.  Therefore, assigning
       another value into $dv and $lv above will simply replace the value, instead of triggering a "STORE"
       method call.

       Similarly, assigning $dv or $dv into another variable will not trigger a "FETCH" method, but simply
       propagates the deferred value over without evaluationg.  This makes it much faster than a "tie"-based
       implementation -- even under the worst case scenario, where it's always immediately forced after
       creation, this module is still twice as fast than Data::Lazy.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Bad things may happen if this module interacts with any other code which fiddles with package 0.

       Performance of creating new deferred or lazy values can be quite poor under perl 5.8.9.  This is due a
       bugfix since 5.8.8, where re-blessing an overloaded object caused bad interactions with other references
       to the same value.  5.8.9's solution involves walking the arenas to find all other references to the same
       object, which can cause "bless" (and thus "defer" in Scalar::Defer to be up to three orders of magnitude
       slower than usual.  perl 5.10.0 and higher do not suffer from this problem.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Data::Thunk, which implements "lazy" values that can replace itself upon forcing, leaving a minimal trace
       of the thunk, with some sneaky XS magic in Data::Swap.
