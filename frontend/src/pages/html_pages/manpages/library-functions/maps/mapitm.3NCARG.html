</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MAPITM - Draws lines on a map, masked by a specified area map.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        CALL MAPITM (RLAT,RLON,IFST,IAMA,XCRA,YCRA,MCRA,IAAI,IAGI, + NOGI,ULPR)

       CALL MAPIQM (IAMA,XCRA,YCRA,MCRA,IAAI,IAGI,NOGI,ULPR)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_mapitm (float rlat, float rlon, int ifst,
       int *iama, float *xcra, float *ycra, int mcra,
       int *iaai, int *iagi, int nogi,
       int (*ulpr)(float *xcra, float *ycra, int *mcra,
       int *iaai, int *iagi, int *nogi))

       void c_mapiqm (int *iama, float *xcra, float *ycra,
       int mcra, int *iaai, int *iagi, int nogi,
       int ulpr(float *xcra, float *ycra, int *mcra,
       int *iaai, int *iagi , int *nogi))

       RLAT and RLON
                   (input  expressions, of type REAL) specify the latitude and longitude of a point to which the
                   "pen" is to be moved. Both are given  in  degrees.  RLAT  must  be  between  -90.  and  +90.,
                   inclusive; RLON must be between -540. and +540., inclusive.

       IFST        (an  input expression, of type INTEGER) is 0 to do a "pen-up" move, 1 to do a "pen-down" move
                   only if the distance from the last point to the new point is greater than 'MV' plotter units,
                   and 2 or greater to do a "pen-down" move regardless of the distance from the  last  point  to
                   the new one.

       IAMA        (an  input/output  array  of  type  INTEGER,  dimensioned as specified in a call to the AREAS
                   initialization routine ARINAM) is the array containing the area map against which lines drawn
                   by MAPIQM will be masked.

       XCRA and YCRA
                   (scratch arrays of type REAL, each dimensioned MCRA) are to be passed by MAPIQM to the  AREAS
                   routine  ARDRLN, which uses them in calls to the user line-processing routine ULPR. They will
                   hold the X and Y coordinates of points in the  fractional  coordinate  system  defining  some
                   portion of the projection of a user-defined polyline on the globe.

       MCRA        (an  input  expression  of type INTEGER) is the size of each of the arrays XCRA and YCRA. The
                   value of MCRA must be at least two. For most applications, the value 100 works nicely.

       IAAI and IAGI
                   (scratch arrays of type INTEGER, each dimensioned NOGI) are to be passed  by  MAPIQM  to  the
                   AREAS routine ARDRLN, which uses them in calls to the user line-processing routine ULPR. They
                   will  hold  area  identifier/group  identifier  pairs  for  the  area containing the polyline
                   fragment defined by XCRA and YCRA.

       NOGI        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the size of each of the arrays IAAI  and  IAGI.  The
                   value  of  NOGI  must be greater than or equal to the number of groups of edges placed in the
                   area map in IAMA.

       ULPR        is the name of a user-provided line-processing routine. This name must appear in an  EXTERNAL
                   statement in the routine that calls MAPITM, so that the compiler and loader will know that it
                   is the name of a routine to be called, rather than the name of a variable.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  routines MAPITM and MAPIQM may be used to draw lines defined by a series of user-specified latitudes
       and longitudes on a map, masked by the areas defined by an area map (perhaps one created  by  a  call  to
       MAPBLA  or perhaps one created by a set of calls to routines in the package AREAS); like MAPIT and MAPIQ,
       they attempt to omit non-visible portions of lines and to handle "cross-over".

       MAPITM is called like the EZMAP routine MAPIT (which see, above) but has some additional arguments:

            CALL MAPITM (RLAT,RLON,IFST,IAMA,XCRA,YCRA,MCRA,IAAI,
           + IAGI,NOGI,ULPR)

       Additional arguments are the area-map array IAMA, coordinate arrays  XCRA  and  YCRA,  dimensioned  MCRA,
       integer  arrays  IAAI and IAGI, dimensioned NOGI, and a user-provided line-processing routine named ULPR.
       MAPIQM is called like the EZMAP routine MAPIQ, to terminate a series of calls to MAPITM and to flush  the
       buffers; it has the same additional arguments:

           CALL MAPIQM (IAMA,XCRA,YCRA,MCRA,IAAI,IAGI,NOGI,ULPR)

       The  additional  arguments  are  passed  by MAPITM and MAPIQM to the routine ARDRLN, in the package named
       AREAS.

       For more information, see the man page for the routine MAPIT.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant example: cmpitm.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use MAPITM or c_mapitm, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably  in
       that order.
