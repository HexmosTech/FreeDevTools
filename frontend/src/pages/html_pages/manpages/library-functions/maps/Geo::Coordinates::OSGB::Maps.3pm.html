</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Geo::Coordinates::OSGB::Maps - Data for OSGB Maps

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       V2.20

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This module exports no functions, but just two hashes of data.

   <b>Hash</b> <b>%name_for_map_series</b>
       The keys are the single letter codes used for each map series.  The values are the descriptive names of
       each series.  Currently we have:

         A : OS Landranger
         B : OS Explorer
         C : OS One-Inch 7th series
         H : Harvey British Mountain Maps
         J : Harvey Superwalker

   <b>Hash</b> <b>%maps</b>
       The keys are short identifiers for each sheet or inset.  Where a map has more than one side, or includes
       insets then, there will be a separate entry for each side and inset.

       The value for each key is another hash containing the following items

       bbox
           The bounding box of the sheet as a list of two pairs of coordinates (in metres from the grid origin)

       polygon
           A  list  of  pairs  of coordinates (in metres from grid origin) that define the corners of the sheet.
           The list starts at the SW corner (approximately, some do not have an obvious  place  to  start),  and
           works round anticlockwise.  In all cases the last pair is the same as the first pair.

       area
           The calculated area of the sheet in square kilometres.

       series
           A  single  letter  series  identifier  -- this will be one of the keys from the "name_for_map_series"
           hash.

       number
           The identifier for this map within the series, not including any suffix for a sheet or an inset.  The
           two sides of a single map have the same number.  The number  is  not  always  an  integer  -  Outdoor
           Leisure  maps  are designated "OL14" etc.  Those maps known by two numbers have a "number" consisting
           of both numbers divided by a "/"; such as "418/OL60" in the Explorer series.

       parent
           The key of the parent map for an inset.  Main sheets of a map will have "parent" equal to  their  own
           key.

       title
           The title of the map.  Different sheets and insets from the same map will have the same title.
