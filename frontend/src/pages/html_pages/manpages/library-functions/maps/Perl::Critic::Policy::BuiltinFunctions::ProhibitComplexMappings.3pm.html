</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitComplexMappings - Map blocks should have a single
       statement.

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is part of the core Perl::Critic distribution.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The map function can be confusing to novices in the best of circumstances.  Mappings with multiple
       statements are even worse.  They're also a maintainer's nightmare because any added complexity decreases
       readability precipitously.  Why?  Because map is traditionally a one-liner converting one array to
       another.  Trying to cram lots of functionality into a one-liner is a bad idea in general.

       The best solutions to a complex mapping are: 1) write a subroutine that performs the manipulation and
       call that from map; 2) rewrite the map as a for loop.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       This policy currently misses some compound statements inside of the map.  For example, the following code
       incorrectly does not trigger a violation:

           map { do { foo(); bar() } } @list

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       By default this policy flags any mappings with more than one statement.  While we do not recommend it,
       you can increase this limit as follows in a <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file:

           [BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitComplexMappings]
           max_statements = 2

</pre><h4><b>CREDITS</b></h4><pre>
       Initial development of this policy was supported by a grant from the Perl Foundation.
