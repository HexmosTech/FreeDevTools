</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Unicode::Japanese module converts encoding of japanese text from one encoding to another.

   <b>FEATURES</b>
       • An instance of Unicode::Japanese internally holds a string in UTF-8.

       • This  module  is  implemented  in  two  ways: XS and pure perl. If efficiency is important for you, you
         should build and install the XS module. If you don't want to, or if you can't build the XS module,  you
         may  use  the  pure  perl module instead. In that case, only you have to do is to copy Japanese.pm into
         somewhere in @INC.

       • This module can convert characters from zenkaku (full-width) form to  hankaku  (half-width)  form,  and
         vice  versa. Conversion between hiragana (one of two sets of japanese phonetical alphabet) and katakana
         (another set of japanese phonetical alphabet) is also supported.

       • This module has mapping tables for emoji  (graphic  characters)  defined  by  various  japanese  mobile
         phones;  DoCoMo  i-mode, ASTEL dot-i and J-PHONE J-Sky. Those letters are mapped on Unicode Private Use
         Area so unicode strings it outputs are still valid even if they contain emoji, and you can safely  pass
         them to other software that can handle Unicode.

       • This  module  can map some emoji from one set to another. Different mobile phones define different sets
         of emoji, so mapping each other is not always possible. But since some emoji exist in two or more  sets
         with similar appearance, this module considers those emoji to be the same.

       • This  module  uses  the  mapping  table  for  MS-CP932 instead of the standard Shift_JIS. The Shift_JIS
         encoding used by MS-Windows (MS-SJIS/MS-CP932) slightly differs from the standard.

       • When the module converts strings from Unicode to Shift_JIS,  EUC-JP  or  ISO-2022-JP,  unicode  letters
         which  can't  be  represented  in  those encodings will be encoded in "&amp;#dddd;" form (decimal character
         reference). Note, however, that letters in Unicode Private Use Area will  be  replaced  with  '?'  mark
         ('QUESTION  MARK'; U+003F) instead of being encoded. In addition, encoding to character sets for mobile
         phones makes every unrepresentable letters being '?' mark.

       • On perl-5.8.0 or later, this module handles the UTF-8  flag:  the  method  <b>utf8()</b>  returns  UTF-8  <u>byte</u>
         string, and the method <b>getu()</b> returns UTF-8 <u>character</u> string.

         Currently the method <b>get()</b> returns UTF-8 <u>byte</u> string but this behavior may be changed in the future.

         Methods  like  <b>sjis()</b>, <b>jis()</b>, <b>utf8()</b>, and such like return <u>byte</u> string. <b>new()</b>, <b>set()</b>, <b>getcode()</b> methods
         just ignore the UTF-8 flag of strings they take.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENT</b></h4><pre>
       •   perl 5.10.x, 5.8.x, etc. (5.004 and later)

       •   (optional) C Compiler.  This module supports both XS and Pure Perl.  If  you  have  no  C  Compilers,
           Unicode::Japanese will be installed as Pure Perl module.

       •   (optional) Test.pm and Test::More for testing.

       No other modules are required at run time.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $s = Unicode::Japanese-&gt;new($str [, $icode [, $encode]])
           Create a new instance of Unicode::Japanese.

           Any given parameters will be internally passed to the method "set"().

       $s = unijp($str [, $icode [, $encode]])
           Same as Unicode::Jananese-&gt;new(...).

       $s-&gt;set($str [, $icode [, $encode]])
           $str: string
           $icode: optional character encoding (default: 'utf8')
           $encode: optional binary encoding (default: no binary encodings are assumed)

           Store a string into the instance.

           Possible character encodings are:

            auto
            utf8 ucs2 ucs4
            utf16-be utf16-le utf16
            utf32-be utf32-le utf32
            sjis cp932 euc euc-jp jis
            sjis-imode sjis-imode1 sjis-imode2
            utf8-imode utf8-imode1 utf8-imode2
            sjis-doti sjis-doti1
            sjis-jsky sjis-jsky1 sjis-jsky2
            jis-jsky  jis-jsky1  jis-jsky2
            utf8-jsky utf8-jsky1 utf8-jsky2
            sjis-au sjis-au1 sjis-au2
            jis-au  jis-au1  jis-au2
            sjis-icon-au sjis-icon-au1 sjis-icon-au2
            euc-icon-au  euc-icon-au1  euc-icon-au2
            jis-icon-au  jis-icon-au1  jis-icon-au2
            utf8-icon-au utf8-icon-au1 utf8-icon-au2
            ascii binary

           (see also "SUPPORTED ENCODINGS".)

           If  you  want  the  Unicode::Japanese  detect  the  character encoding of string, you must explicitly
           specify 'auto' as the second argument. In that case, the given string will be passed  to  the  method
           <b>getcode()</b> to guess the encoding.

           For  binary  encodings,  only  'base64'  is currently supported. If you specify 'base64' as the third
           argument, the given string will be decoded using Base64 decoder.

           Specify 'binary' as the second argument if you want your string to be stored without modification.

           When you specify 'sjis-imode' or 'sjis-doti' as the character encoding, any occurences  of  '&amp;#dddd;'
           (decimal  character  reference) in the string will be interpreted and decoded as code point of emoji,
           just like emoji implanted into the string in binary form.

           Since encoded forms of strings in various encodings are not clearly distinctive to each other, it  is
           not always certainly possible to detect what encoding is used for a given string.

           When a given string is possibly interpreted as both Shift_JIS and UTF-8 string, this module considers
           such  a  string  to  be  encoded  in  Shift_JIS.  And  if the encoding is not distinguishable between
           'sjis-au' and 'sjis-doti', this module considers it 'sjis-au'.

       $str = $s-&gt;get
           $str: string (UTF-8)

           Get the internal string in UTF-8.

           This method currently returns a byte string (whose UTF-8 flag is turned off), but this  behavior  may
           be changed in the future.

           If  you  absolutely  want  a byte string, you should use the method <b>utf8()</b> instead. And if you want a
           character string (whose UTF-8 flag is turned on), you have to use the method <b>getu()</b>.

       $str = $s-&gt;getu
           $str: string (UTF-8)

           Get the internal string in UTF-8.

           On perl-5.8.0 or later, this method returns a character string with its UTF-8 flag turned on.

       $code = $s-&gt;getcode($str)
           $str: string
           $code: name of character encoding

           Detect the character encoding of given string.

           Note that this method, exceptionaly, doesn't deal with the internal string of an instance.

           To guess the encoding, the following algorithm is used:

           (For pure perl implementation)

           1.  If the string has an UTF-32 BOM, its encoding is 'utf32'.

           2.  If it has an UTF-16 BOM, its encoding is 'utf16'.

           3.  If it is valid for UTF-32BE, its encoding is 'utf32-be'.

           4.  If it is valid for UTF-32LE, its encoding is 'utf32-le'.

           5.  If it contains no ESC characters or bytes whose eighth bit is on, its encoding is 'ascii'.  Every
               ASCII control characters (0x00-0x1F and 0x7F) except ESC (0x1B) are considered to be in the range
               of 'ascii'.

           6.  If it contains escape sequences of ISO-2022-JP, its encoding is 'jis'.

           7.  If it contains any emoji defined for J-PHONE, its encoding is 'sjis-jsky'.

           8.  If it is valid for EUC-JP, its encoding is 'euc'.

           9.  If it is valid for Shift_JIS, its encoding is 'sjis'.

           10. If it contains any emoji defined for au, and everything else is valid for Shift_JIS, its encoding
               is 'sjis-au'.

           11. If  it  contains  any  emoji  defined for i-mode, and everything else is valid for Shift_JIS, its
               encoding is 'sjis-imode'.

           12. If it contains any emoji defined for dot-i, and everything  else  is  valid  for  Shift_JIS,  its
               encoding is 'sjis-doti'.

           13. If it is valid for UTF-8, its encoding is 'utf8'.

           14. If no conditions above are fulfilled, its encoding is 'unknown'.

           (For XS implementation)

           1.  If the string has an UTF-32 BOM, its encoding is 'utf32'.

           2.  If it has an UTF-16 BOM, its encoding is 'utf16'.

           3.  Find all possible encodings that might have been applied to the string from the following:

               ascii  / euc / sjis / jis / utf8 / utf32-be / utf32-le / sjis-jsky / sjis-imode / sjis-au / sjis-
               doti

           4.  If any encodings have been found possible, this module picks out one encoding having the  highest
               priority among them. The priority order is as follows:

               utf32-be  /  utf32-le / ascii / jis / euc / sjis / sjis-jsky / sjis-imode / sjis-au / sjis-doti /
               utf8

           5.  If no conditions above are fulfilled, its encoding is 'unknown'.

           Pay attention to the following pitfalls in the above algorithm:

           • UTF-8 strings might be accidentally considered to be encoded in Shift_JIS.

           • UCS-2 strings (sequence of raw UCS-2 letters in big-endian; each letters has always 2 bytes)  can't
             be  detected  because  they look like nothing but sequences of random bytes whose length is an even
             number.

           • UTF-16 strings must have BOM to be detected.

           • Emoji are only be recognized if they are implanted into the string in  binary  form.  If  they  are
             described in '&amp;#dddd;' form, they aren't considered to be emoji.

           Since the XS and pure perl implementations use different algorithms to guess encoding, they may guess
           differently  for  the  same  string. Especially, the pure perl implementation finds Shift_JIS strings
           containing ESC character (0x1B) to be actually encoded in Shift_JIS but  XS  implementation  doesn't.
           This  is  because  such  strings  can  hardly  be distinguished from 'sjis-jsky'. In addition, EUC-JP
           strings containing ESC character are also rejected for the same reason.

       $code = $s-&gt;getcodelist($str)
           $str: string
           $code: name of character encodings

           Detect the character encoding of given string.

           Unlike the method <b>getcode()</b>, <b>getcodelist()</b> returns a list of possible encodings.

       $str = $s-&gt;conv($ocode, $encode)
           $ocode: character encoding (possible encodings are:)
              utf8 ucs2 ucs4 utf16
              sjis cp932 euc euc-jp jis
              sjis-imode sjis-imode1 sjis-imode2
              utf8-imode utf8-imode1 utf8-imode2

              utf8-icon-au utf8-icon-au1 utf8-icon-au2
              binary

             (see also "SUPPORTED ENCODINGS".)

             Some encodings for mobile phones have a trailing digit like 'sjis-au2'. Those digits represent  the
             version number of encodings. Such encodings have a variant with no trailing digits, like 'sjis-au',
             which is the same as the latest version among its variants.

           $encode: optional binary encoding
           $str: string

           Get the internal string of instance with encoding it using a given character encoding method.

           If you want the resulting string to be encoded in Base64, specify 'base64' as the second argument.

           On  perl-5.8.0  or later, the UTF-8 flag of resulting string is turned off even if you specify 'utf8'
           to the first argument.

       $s-&gt;tag2bin
           Interpret decimal character references (&amp;#dddd;) in the  instance,  and  replaces  them  with  single
           characters they represent.

       $s-&gt;z2h
           Replace zenkaku (full-width) letters in the instance with hankaku (half-width) letters.

       $s-&gt;h2z
           Replace hankaku (half-width) letters in the instance with zenkaku (full-width) letters.

       $s-&gt;hira2kata
           Replace any hiragana in the instance with katakana.

       $s-&gt;kata2hira
           Replace any katakana in the instance with hiragana.

       $str = $s-&gt;jis
           $str: byte string in ISO-2022-JP

           Get the internal string of instance with encoding it in ISO-2022-JP.

       $str = $s-&gt;euc
           $str: byte string in EUC-JP

           Get the internal string of instance with encoding it in EUC-JP.

       $str = $s-&gt;utf8
           $str: byte string in UTF-8

           Get the internal UTF-8 string of instance.

           On perl-5.8.0 or later, the UTF-8 flag of resulting string is turned off.

       $str = $s-&gt;ucs2
           $str: byte string in UCS-2

           Get  the internal string of instance as a sequence of raw UCS-2 letters in big-endian. Note that this
           is different from UTF-16BE as raw UCS-2 sequence has no concept of surrogate pair.

       $str = $s-&gt;ucs4
           $str: byte string in UCS-4

           Get the internal string of instance as a sequence  of  raw  UCS-4  letters  in  big-endian.  This  is
           practically the same as UTF-32BE.

       $str = $s-&gt;utf16
           $str: byte string in UTF-16

           Get the insternal string of instance with encoding it in UTF-16 in big-endian with no BOM prepended.

       $str = $s-&gt;sjis

           $str: byte string in 'sjis-imode1'

           Get the internal string of instance with encoding it in 'sjis-imode1'.

       $str = $s-&gt;sjis_imode2
           $str: byte string in 'sjis-imode2'

           Get the internal string of instance with encoding it in 'sjis-imode2'.

       $str = $s-&gt;sjis_doti
           $str: byte string in 'sjis-doti'

           Get the internal string of instance with encoding it in 'sjis-doti'.

       $str = $s-&gt;sjis_jsky
           $str: byte string in 'sjis-jsky'

           Get the internal string of instance with encoding it in 'sjis-jsky'.

       $str = $s-&gt;sjis_jsky1
           $str: byte string in 'sjis-jsky1'

           Get the internal string of instance with encoding it in 'sjis-jsky1'.

       $str = $s-&gt;sjis_jsky
           $str: byte string in 'sjis-jsky'

           Get the internal string of instance with encoding it in 'sjis-jsky'.

       $str = $s-&gt;sjis_icon_au
           $str: byte string in 'sjis-icon-au'

           Get the internal string of instance with encoding it in 'sjis-icon-au'.

       $str_arrayref = $s-&gt;strcut($len)
           $len: maximum length of each chunks (in number of full-width characters)
           $str_arrayref: reference to array of strings

           Split the internal string of instance into chunks of a given length.

           On perl-5.8.0 or later, UTF-8 flags of each chunks are turned on.

       $len = $s-&gt;strlen
           $len: character width of the internal string

           Calculate  the  character width of the internal string. Half-width characters have width of one unit,
           and full-width characters have width of two units.

       $s-&gt;join_csv(@values);
           @values: array of strings

           Build a line of CSV from the arguments, and store it into the instance.  The  resulting  line  has  a
           trailing line break ("\n").

       @values = $s-&gt;split_csv;
           @values: array of strings

           Parse  a  line  of  CSV  in  the  instance and return each columns. The line will be <b>chomp()</b>ed before
           getting parsed.

           If the internal string was decoded from 'binary' encoding (see methods <b>new()</b> and  <b>set()</b>),  the  UTF-8
           flags of the resulting array of strings are turned off. Otherwise the flags are turned on.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>UNICODE</b> <b>MAPPING</b></h4><pre>
       Transcoding between Unicode encodings and other ones is performed as below:

       Shift_JIS
         This module uses the mapping table of MS-CP932.

         &lt;<a href="ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/MICSFT/WINDOWS/CP932.TXT">ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/MICSFT/WINDOWS/CP932.TXT</a>&gt;

         When  the  module  tries to convert Unicode string to Shift_JIS, it represents most letters which isn't
         available in Shift_JIS as decimal character reference ('&amp;#dddd;'). There  is  one  exception  to  this:
         every graphic characters for mobile phones are replaced with '?' mark.

         For variants of Shift_JIS defined for mobile phones, every unrepresentable characters are replaced with
         '?' mark unlike the plain Shift_JIS.

       EUC-JP/ISO-2022-JP
         This  module  doesn't  directly  convert Unicode string from/to EUC-JP or ISO-2022-JP: it once converts
         from/to Shift_JIS and then do the rest  translation.  So  characters  which  aren't  available  in  the
         Shift_JIS can not be properly translated.

       DoCoMo i-mode
         This module maps emoji in the range of F800 - F9FF to U+0FF800 - U+0FF9FF.

       ASTEL dot-i
         This module maps emoji in the range of F000 - F4FF to U+0FF000 - U+0FF4FF.

       J-PHONE J-SKY
         The  encoding  method defined by J-SKY is as follows: first an escape sequence "\e\$" comes to indicate
         the beginning of emoji, then the first byte of an emoji comes next, then the second bytes of  at  least
         one  emoji  comes  next,  then  "\x0f"  comes last to indicate the end of emoji. If a string contains a
         series of emoji whose first bytes are identical, such sequence can be compressed  by  cascading  second
         bytes of them to the single first byte.

         This module considers a pair of those first and second bytes to be one letter, and map them from 4500 -
         47FF to U+0FFB00 - U+0FFDFF.

         When the module encodes J-SKY emoji, it performs the compression automatically.

       AU
         This module maps AU emoji to U+0FF500 - U+0FF6FF.

</pre><h4><b>PurePerl</b> <b>mode</b></h4><pre>
          use Unicode::Japanese qw(PurePerl);

       If you want to explicitly take the pure perl implementation, pass 'PurePerl' to the argument of the "use"
       statement.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Please     report     bugs     and    requests    to    "bug-unicode-japanese    at    rt.cpan.org"    or
       &lt;<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html">http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html</a>?Queue=Unicode-Japanese&gt;.  If  you  report  them  to   the   web
       interface, any progress to your report will be automatically sent back to you.

       • This  module  doesn't  directly  convert Unicode string from/to EUC-JP or ISO-2022-JP: it once converts
         from/to Shift_JIS and then do the rest  translation.  So  characters  which  aren't  available  in  the
         Shift_JIS can not be properly translated.

       • The XS implementation of <b>getcode()</b> fails to detect the encoding when the given string contains \e while
         its encoding is EUC-JP or Shift_JIS.

       • Japanese.pm  is  composed of textual perl script and binary character conversion table. If you transfer
         it on FTP using ASCII mode, the file will collapse.
