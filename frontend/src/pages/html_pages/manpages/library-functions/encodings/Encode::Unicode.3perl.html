       Encode::Unicode -- Various Unicode Transformation Formats

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Encode qw/encode decode/;
           $ucs2 = encode("UCS-2BE", $utf8);
           $utf8 = decode("UCS-2BE", $ucs2);

</pre><h4><b>ABSTRACT</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements all Character Encoding Schemes of Unicode that are officially documented by
       Unicode Consortium (except, of course, for UTF-8, which is a native format in perl).

       &lt;<a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/">http://www.unicode.org/glossary/</a>&gt; says:
           <u>Character</u>  <u>Encoding</u>  <u>Scheme</u>  A  character  encoding  form  plus  byte  serialization. There are Seven
           character encoding schemes in Unicode: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE,  UTF-32  (UCS-4),  UTF-32BE
           (UCS-4BE) and UTF-32LE (UCS-4LE), and UTF-7.

           Since  UTF-7  is  a  7-bit  (re)encoded  version  of  UTF-16BE, It is not part of Unicode's Character
           Encoding  Scheme.   It  is  separately  implemented  in  Encode::Unicode::UTF7.   For   details   see
           Encode::Unicode::UTF7.

</pre><h4><b>Size,</b> <b>Endianness,</b> <b>and</b> <b>BOM</b></h4><pre>
       You can categorize these CES by 3 criteria:  size of each character, endianness, and Byte Order Mark.

   <b>by</b> <b>size</b>
       UCS-2  is  a  fixed-length  encoding  with  each character taking 16 bits.  It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> support <u>surrogate</u>
       <u>pairs</u>.  When a surrogate pair is encountered during <b>decode()</b>, its place is filled with \x{FFFD} if  <u>CHECK</u>
       is  0,  or  the  routine croaks if <u>CHECK</u> is 1.  When a character whose ord value is larger than 0xFFFF is
       encountered, its place is filled with \x{FFFD} if <u>CHECK</u> is 0, or the routine croaks if <u>CHECK</u> is 1.

       UTF-16 is almost the same as UCS-2 but it supports <u>surrogate</u> <u>pairs</u>.  When it encounters a high  surrogate
       (0xD800-0xDBFF), it fetches the following low surrogate (0xDC00-0xDFFF) and "desurrogate"s them to form a
       character.  Bogus surrogates result in death.  When \x{10000} or above is encountered during <b>encode()</b>, it
       "ensurrogate"s them and pushes the surrogate pair to the output stream.

       UTF-32  (UCS-4) is a fixed-length encoding with each character taking 32 bits.  Since it is 32-bit, there
       is no need for <u>surrogate</u> <u>pairs</u>.

   <b>by</b> <b>endianness</b>
       The first (and now failed) goal of Unicode was to map  all  character  repertoires  into  a  fixed-length
       integer  so that programmers are happy.  Since each character is either a <u>short</u> or <u>long</u> in C, you have to
       pay attention to the endianness of each platform when you pass data to one another.

       Anything marked as BE is Big Endian (or network byte order) and LE is Little Endian (aka VAX byte order).
       For anything not marked either BE or LE,  a  character  called  Byte  Order  Mark  (BOM)  indicating  the
       endianness is prepended to the string.

       CAVEAT: Though BOM in utf8 (\xEF\xBB\xBF) is valid, it is meaningless and as of this writing Encode suite
       just leave it as is (\x{FeFF}).

       BOM as integer when fetched in network byte order
                         16         32 bits/char
             -------------------------
             BE      0xFeFF 0x0000FeFF
             LE      0xFFFe 0xFFFe0000
             -------------------------

       This modules handles the BOM as follows.

       •   When  BE  or  LE  is  explicitly  stated  as  the name of encoding, BOM is simply treated as a normal
           character (ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE).

       •   When BE or LE is omitted during <b>decode()</b>, it checks if BOM is at the beginning of the string; if  one
           is found, the endianness is set to what the BOM says.

       •   Default Byte Order

           When  no  BOM  is  found,  Encode  2.76  and  blow  croaked.   Since Encode 2.77, it falls back to BE
           accordingly to RFC2781 and the Unicode Standard version 8.0

       •   When BE or LE is omitted during <b>encode()</b>, it returns a BE-encoded string with BOM prepended.  So when
           you want to encode a whole text file, make sure you <b>encode()</b> the whole text at once, not line by line
           or each line, not file, will have a BOM prepended.

       •   "UCS-2" is an exception.  Unlike others, this is an alias of UCS-2BE.  UCS-2 is already registered by
           IANA and others that way.

</pre><h4><b>Surrogate</b> <b>Pairs</b></h4><pre>
       To say the least, surrogate pairs were the biggest mistake of the Unicode Consortium.  But  according  to
       the  late  Douglas  Adams in <u>The</u> <u>Hitchhiker's</u> <u>Guide</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>Galaxy</u> Trilogy, "In the beginning the Universe
       was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as  a  bad  move".   Their
       mistake was not of this magnitude so let's forgive them.

       (I don't dare make any comparison with Unicode Consortium and the Vogons here ;)  Or, comparing Encode to
       Babel Fish is completely appropriate -- if you can only stick this into your ear :)

       Surrogate  pairs  were born when the Unicode Consortium finally admitted that 16 bits were not big enough
       to hold all the world's character repertoires.  But they already made UCS-2 16-bit.  What do we do?

       Back then, the range 0xD800-0xDFFF was not allocated.  Let's split that range in half and use  the  first
       half  to  represent the "upper half of a character" and the second half to represent the "lower half of a
       character".  That way, you can represent 1024 * 1024  =  1048576  more  characters.   Now  we  can  store
       character  ranges up to \x{10ffff} even with 16-bit encodings.  This pair of half-character is now called
       a <u>surrogate</u> <u>pair</u> and UTF-16 is the name of the encoding that embraces them.

       Here is a formula to ensurrogate a Unicode character \x{10000} and above;

         $hi = ($uni - 0x10000) / 0x400 + 0xD800;
         $lo = ($uni - 0x10000) % 0x400 + 0xDC00;

       And to desurrogate;

        $uni = 0x10000 + ($hi - 0xD800) * 0x400 + ($lo - 0xDC00);

       Note this move has made \x{D800}-\x{DFFF} into a forbidden zone but perl does not  prohibit  the  use  of
       characters  within  this  range.   To  perl,  every  one  of  \x{0000_0000}  up to \x{ffff_ffff} (*) is <u>a</u>
       <u>character</u>.

         (*) or \x{ffff_ffff_ffff_ffff} if your perl is compiled with 64-bit
         integer support!

</pre><h4><b>Error</b> <b>Checking</b></h4><pre>
       Unlike most encodings which accept various ways to handle errors, Unicode encodings simply croaks.

         % perl -MEncode -e'$_ = "\xfe\xff\xd8\xd9\xda\xdb\0\n"' \
                -e'Encode::from_to($_, "utf16","shift_jis", 0); print'
         UTF-16:Malformed LO surrogate d8d9 at /path/to/Encode.pm line 184.
         % perl -MEncode -e'$a = "BOM missing"' \
                -e' Encode::from_to($a, "utf16", "shift_jis", 0); print'
         UTF-16:Unrecognised BOM 424f at /path/to/Encode.pm line 184.

       Unlike other encodings where mappings are not one-to-one against Unicode, UTFs are supposed to  map  100%
       against one another.  So Encode is more strict on UTFs.

       Consider that "division by zero" of Encode :)
