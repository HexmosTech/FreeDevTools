       Unicode::Map8 - Mapping table between 8-bit chars and Unicode

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        require Unicode::Map8;
        my $no_map = Unicode::Map8-&gt;new("ISO646-NO") || die;
        my $l1_map = Unicode::Map8-&gt;new("latin1")    || die;

        my $ustr = $no_map-&gt;to16("V}re norske tegn b|r {res\n");
        my $lstr = $l1_map-&gt;to8($ustr);
        print $lstr;

        print $no_map-&gt;tou("V}re norske tegn b|r {res\n")-&gt;utf8

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>Unicode::Map8</u> class implement efficient mapping tables between 8-bit character sets and 16 bit
       character sets like Unicode.  The tables are efficient both in terms of space allocated and translation
       speed.  The 16-bit strings is assumed to use network byte order.

       The following methods are available:

       $m = Unicode::Map8-&gt;new( [$charset] )
           The  object  constructor  creates  new  instances  of  the  Unicode::Map8 class.  I takes an optional
           argument that specify then name of a 8-bit character set to initialize mappings from.   The  argument
           can  also  be  a  the  name  of  a  mapping  file.   If the charset/file can not be located, then the
           constructor returns <u>undef</u>.

           If you omit the argument, then an empty mapping table is constructed.   You  must  then  add  mapping
           pairs to it using the <b>addpair()</b> method described below.

       $m-&gt;addpair( $u8, $u16 );
           Adds  a new mapping pair to the mapping object.  It takes two arguments.  The first is the code value
           in the 8-bit character set and the second is the corresponding code value  in  the  16-bit  character
           set.   The  same codes can be used multiple times (but using the same pair has no effect).  The first
           definition for a code is the one that is used.

           Consider the following example:

             $m-&gt;addpair(0x20, 0x0020);
             $m-&gt;addpair(0x20, 0x00A0);
             $m-&gt;addpair(0xA0, 0x00A0);

           It means that the character 0x20 and 0xA0 in the 8-bit charset maps to themselves in the 16-bit  set,
           but in the 16-bit character set 0x0A0 maps to 0x20.

       $m-&gt;default_to8( $u8 )
           Set  the code of the default character to use when mapping from 16-bit to 8-bit strings.  If there is
           no mapping pair defined for a character then this default is substituted by <b>to8()</b> and <b>recode8()</b>.

       $m-&gt;default_to16( $u16 )
           Set the code of the default character to use when mapping from 8-bit to 16-bit strings. If  there  is
           no mapping pair defined for a character then this default is used by <b>to16()</b>, <b>tou()</b> and <b>recode8()</b>.

       $m-&gt;nostrict;
           All undefined mappings are replaced with the identity mapping.  Undefined character are normally just
           removed (or replaced with the default if defined) when converting between character sets.

       $m-&gt;to8( $ustr );
           Converts a 16-bit character string to the corresponding string in the 8-bit character set.

       $m-&gt;to16( $str );
           Converts a 8-bit character string to the corresponding string in the 16-bit character set.

       $m-&gt;tou( $str );
           Same an <b>to16()</b> but return a Unicode::String object instead of a plain UCS2 string.

       $m-&gt;recode8($m2, $str);
           Map  the string $str from one 8-bit character set ($m) to another one ($m2).  Since we assume we know
           the mappings towards the common 16-bit encoding we can use this to convert between any of  the  8-bit
           character sets.

       $m-&gt;to_char16( $u8 )
           Maps  a  single  8-bit character code to an 16-bit code.  If the 8-bit character is unmapped then the
           constant NOCHAR is returned.  The default is not used and the callback method is not invoked.

       $m-&gt;to_char8( $u16 )
           Maps a single 16-bit character code to an 8-bit code. If the 16-bit character is  unmapped  then  the
           constant NOCHAR is returned.  The default is not used and the callback method is not invoked.

       The  following  callback methods are available.  You can override these methods by creating a subclass of
       Unicode::Map8.

       $m-&gt;unmapped_to8
           When mapping to 8-bit character string and there is no mapping defined (and no default either),  then
           this  method  is called as the last resort.  It is called with a single integer argument which is the
           code of the unmapped 16-bit character.  It is expected to return a string that will  be  incorporated
           in the 8-bit string.  The default version of this method always returns an empty string.

           Example:

            package MyMapper;
            @ISA=qw(Unicode::Map8);

            sub unmapped_to8
            {
               my($self, $code) = @_;
               require Unicode::CharName;
               "&lt;" . Unicode::CharName::uname($code) . "&gt;";
            }

       $m-&gt;unmapped_to16
           Likewise  when  mapping  to  16-bit  character  string  and no mapping is defined then this method is
           called.  It should return a 16-bit string with the bytes in network byte order.  The default  version
           of this method always returns an empty string.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>Unicode::Map8</u> constructor can parse two different file formats; a binary format and a textual format.

       The  binary  format  is  simple.  It consist of a sequence of 16-bit integer pairs in network byte order.
       The first pair should contain the magic value 0xFFFE, 0x0001.  Of each pair, the first value is the  code
       of  an 8-bit character and the second is the code of the 16-bit character.  If follows from this that the
       first value should be less than 256.

       The textual format consist of lines that is either a  comment  (first  non-blank  character  is  '#'),  a
       completely  blank  line or a line with two hexadecimal numbers.  The hexadecimal numbers must be preceded
       by "0x" as in C and Perl.  This is the same format used by  the  Unicode  mapping  files  available  from
       &lt;URL:<a href="ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public">ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public</a>&gt;.

       The mapping table files are installed in the <u>Unicode/Map8/maps</u> directory somewhere in the Perl @INC path.
       The  variable $Unicode::Map8::MAPS_DIR is the complete path name to this directory.  Binary mapping files
       are stored within this directory with the suffix <u>.bin</u>.  Textual mapping files are stored with the  suffix
       <u>.txt</u>.

       The scripts <u>map8_bin2txt</u> and <u>map8_txt2bin</u> can translate between these mapping file formats.

       A special file called <u>aliases</u> within $MAPS_DIR specify all the alias names that can be used to denote the
       various  character  sets.   The first name of each line is the real file name and the rest is alias names
       separated by space.

       The `"umap --list"' command be used to list the character sets supported.
