</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       utf8::all - turn on Unicode - all of it

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.024

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use utf8::all;                      # Turn on UTF-8, all of it.

           open my $in, '&lt;', 'contains-utf8';  # UTF-8 already turned on here
           print length 'føø bār';             # 7 UTF-8 characters
           my $utf8_arg = shift @ARGV;         # @ARGV is UTF-8 too (only for main)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "use utf8" pragma tells the Perl parser to allow UTF-8 in the program text in the current lexical
       scope. This also means that you can now use literal Unicode characters as part of strings, variable
       names, and regular expressions.

       "utf8::all" goes further:

       •   "charnames"  are  imported  so "\N{...}" sequences can be used to compile Unicode characters based on
           names.

       •   On Perl "v5.11.0" or higher, the "use feature 'unicode_strings'" is enabled.

       •   "use feature fc" and "use feature unicode_eval" are enabled on Perl 5.16.0 and higher.

       •   Filehandles are opened with UTF-8 encoding turned on by default  (including  "STDIN",  "STDOUT",  and
           "STDERR"  when  "utf8::all" is used from the "main" package). Meaning that they automatically convert
           UTF-8 octets to characters and vice versa. If you <u>don't</u>  want  UTF-8  for  a  particular  filehandle,
           you'll have to set "binmode $filehandle".

       •   @ARGV  gets  converted  from  UTF-8  octets  to Unicode characters (when "utf8::all" is used from the
           "main" package). This is similar to  the  behaviour  of  the  "-CA"  perl  command-line  switch  (see
           perlrun).

       •   "readdir",  "readlink",  "readpipe"  (including  the  "qx//"  and  backtick  operators),  and  "glob"
           (including the "&lt;&gt;" operator) now all work with and return  Unicode  characters  instead  of  (UTF-8)
           octets (again only when "utf8::all" is used from the "main" package).

   <b>Lexical</b> <b>Scope</b>
       The pragma is lexically-scoped, so you can do the following if you had some reason to:

           {
               use utf8::all;
               open my $out, '&gt;', 'outfile';
               my $utf8_str = 'føø bār';
               print length $utf8_str, "\n"; # 7
               print $out $utf8_str;         # out as utf8
           }
           open my $in, '&lt;', 'outfile';      # in as raw
           my $text = do { local $/; &lt;$in&gt;};
           print length $text, "\n";         # 10, not 7!

       Instead of lexical scoping, you can also use "no utf8::all" to turn off the effects.

       Note  that  the effect on @ARGV and the "STDIN", "STDOUT", and "STDERR" file handles is always global and
       can not be undone!

   <b>Enabling/Disabling</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Features</b>
       As described above, the default behaviour of "utf8::all" is to convert @ARGV and  to  open  the  "STDIN",
       "STDOUT",  and  "STDERR"  file  handles  with  UTF-8  encoding, and override the "readlink" and "readdir"
       functions and "glob" operators when "utf8::all" is used from the "main" package.

       If you want to disable these features even when "utf8::all" is used from  the  "main"  package,  add  the
       option "NO-GLOBAL" (or "LEXICAL-ONLY") to the use line. E.g.:

           use utf8::all 'NO-GLOBAL';

       If  on the other hand you want to enable these global effects even when "utf8::all" was used from another
       package than "main", use the option "GLOBAL" on the use line:

           use utf8::all 'GLOBAL';

   <b>UTF-8</b> <b>Errors</b>
       "utf8::all" will handle invalid  code  points  (i.e.,  utf-8  that  does  not  map  to  a  valid  unicode
       "character"), as a fatal error.

       For  "glob",  "readdir",  and  "readlink",  one  can  change  this  behaviour  by  setting  the attribute
       "$utf8::all::UTF8_CHECK".

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$utf8::all::UTF8_CHECK</b>
       By  default  "utf8::all"  marks  decoding  errors  as  fatal  (default  value   for   this   setting   is
       "Encode::FB_CROAK").  If  you  want,  you  can  change  this by setting $utf8::all::UTF8_CHECK. The value
       "Encode::FB_WARN" reports the encoding errors  as  warnings,  and  "Encode::FB_DEFAULT"  will  completely
       ignore them. Please see Encode for details. Note: "Encode::LEAVE_SRC" is <u>always</u> enforced.

       Important: Only controls the handling of decoding errors in "glob", "readdir", and "readlink".

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTION</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>AUTODIE</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  use  autodie, which is a great idea, you need to use at least version <b>2.12</b>, released on June 26,
       2012 &lt;https://metacpan.org/source/PJF/autodie-2.12/Changes#L3&gt;.  Otherwise, autodie  obliterates  the  IO
       layers set by the open pragma. See RT #54777 &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=54777&gt; and GH #7
       &lt;https://github.com/doherty/utf8-all/issues/7&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Please     report     any     bugs     or     feature     requests     on    the    bugtracker    website
       &lt;https://github.com/doherty/utf8-all/issues&gt;.

       When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch to  an  existing  test-file  that
       illustrates the bug or desired feature.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The  filesystems  of  Dos,  Windows,  and OS/2 do not (fully) support UTF-8. The "readlink" and "readdir"
       functions and "glob" operators will therefore not be replaced on these systems.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       •   File::Find::utf8 for fully utf-8 aware File::Find functions.

       •   Cwd::utf8 for fully utf-8 aware Cwd functions.
