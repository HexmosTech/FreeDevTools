</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Unicode::CaseFold - Unicode case-folding for case-insensitive lookups.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.01

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Unicode::CaseFold;

           my $folded = fc $string;

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>Case-Folding?</b>
       In non-Unicode contexts, a common idiom to compare two strings case-insensitively is "lc($this) eq
       lc($that)". Before comparing two strings we <u>normalize</u> them to an all-lowercase version. "Hello", "HELLO",
       and "HeLlO" all have the same lowercase form ("hello"), so it doesn't matter which one we start with;
       they are all equal to one another after "lc".

       In Unicode, things aren't so simple. A Unicode character might have mappings for <u>uppercase</u>, <u>lowercase</u>,
       and <u>titlecase</u>, and the lowercase mapping of the uppercase mapping of a given character might not be the
       character that you started with! For example "lc(uc("\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S"))" is "ss", not the
       eszett we started off with! Case-folding is a part of the Unicode standard that allows any two strings
       that differ from one another only by case to map to the same "case-folded" form, even when those strings
       include characters with complex case-mappings.

   <b>Use</b> <b>for</b> <b>Case-insensitive</b> <b>Comparison</b>
       Simply write "fc($this) eq fc($that)" instead of "lc($this) eq lc($that)".  You can also use "index" on
       case-folded strings for substring search.

   <b>Use</b> <b>for</b> <b>String</b> <b>Lookups</b>
       Frequently we want to store data in a hash, or a database, or an external file for later retrieval.
       Sometimes we want to be able to match the keys in this data case-insensitively -- that is, we should be
       able to store some data under the key "hello" and later retrieve it with the key "HELLO". Some databases
       have complete support for collation, but in other databases the support is missing or broken, and Perl
       hashes don't support it at all. By making case-folding part of the process you use to normalize your keys
       before using them to access a database or data structure, you get case-insensitive lookup.

           $roles{fc "Samuel L. Jackson"} = ["Gin Rummy", "Nick Fury", "Mace Windu"];

           $roles = $roles{fc "Samuel l. JACKSON"}; # Gets the data.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides Unicode case-folding for Perl. Case-folding is a tool that allows a program to make
       case-insensitive string comparisons or do case-insensitive lookups.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>fc($str)</b>
       Exported by default when you use the module. "use Unicode::CaseFold ()" or "use Unicode::CaseFold
       qw(case_fold !fc)" if you don't want it to be exported.

       Returns the case-folded version of $str. This function is prototyped to act as much as possible like the
       built-ins "lc" and "uc"; it imposes a scalar context on its argument, and if called with no argument it
       will return the case-folded version of $_.

   <b>case_fold($str)</b>
       Exported on request. Just like "fc", except that it has no prototype and won't case-fold $_ if called
       without an argument.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$Unicode::CaseFold::XS</b>
       Whether the XS extension is in use. The pure-perl implementation is 5-10 times slower than the XS
       extension, and on versions of perl before 5.10.0 it will use simple case-folding instead of full case-
       folding (see below).

   <b>$Unicode::CaseFold::SIMPLE_FOLDING</b>
       Is set to true if the perl version is prior to 5.10.0 and the XS extension is not available. In this
       case, "fc" will perform a simple case-folding instead of a full case-folding. Although relatively few
       characters are affected, strings case-folded using simple folding might not compare equal to the
       corresponding strings case-folded with full folding, which may cause compatibility issues.

       Furthermore, when simple folding is in use, some strings that would have case-folded to the same value
       when using full folding will instead case-fold to different values. For example, fc("Wei\x{df}") and
       fc("Weiss") both produce "weiss" when full folding is in effect, but the former produces "wei\x{df}" when
       using simple folding.

       If you want to check for this potentially dangerous situation, consult the
       $Unicode::CaseFold::SIMPLE_FOLDING variable.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       •   "Unicode::CaseFold" requires Perl 5.8.1 or newer.

       •   Different  versions of perl include different versions of the Unicode database, which is revised over
           time. If you are likely to be comparing strings that have been folded  using  different  versions  of
           perl,  you  may  need  to  consult  the changes for intervening Unicode standard versions to find out
           whether your code will work correctly.

       •   "Unicode::CaseFold" uses "simple" rather than "full" case-folding when operating in Pure-perl mode on
           perl     versions     previous     to     5.10.0.     For     compatibility     implications,     see
           "$Unicode::CaseFold::SIMPLE_FOLDING".
