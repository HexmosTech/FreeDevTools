       DBIx::Class::UTF8Columns - Force UTF8 (Unicode) flag on columns (DEPRECATED)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package Artist;
           use base 'DBIx::Class::Core';

           __PACKAGE__-&gt;load_components(qw/UTF8Columns/);
           __PACKAGE__-&gt;utf8_columns(qw/name description/);

           # then belows return strings with utf8 flag
           $artist-&gt;name;
           $artist-&gt;get_column('description');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module allows you to get and store utf8 (unicode) column data in a database that does not natively
       support unicode. It ensures that column data is correctly serialised as a byte stream when stored and de-
       serialised to unicode strings on retrieval.

         THE USE OF THIS MODULE (AND ITS COUSIN DBIx::Class::ForceUTF8) IS VERY
         STRONGLY DISCOURAGED, PLEASE READ THE WARNINGS BELOW FOR AN EXPLANATION.

       If you want to continue using this module and do not want to receive further warnings set the environment
       variable "DBIC_UTF8COLUMNS_OK" to a true value.

   <b>Warning</b> <b>-</b> <b>Module</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>function</b> <b>properly</b> <b>on</b> <b>create/insert</b>
       Recently (April 2010) a bug was found deep in the core of DBIx::Class which affects any component
       attempting to perform encoding/decoding by overloading store_column and get_columns. As a result of this
       problem create sends the original column values to the database, while update sends the encoded values.
       DBIx::Class::UTF8Columns and DBIx::Class::ForceUTF8 are both affected by this bug.

       It is unclear how this bug went undetected for so long (it was introduced in March 2006), No attempts to
       fix it will be made while the implications of changing such a fundamental behavior of DBIx::Class are
       being evaluated. However in this day and age you should not be using this module anyway as Unicode is
       properly supported by all major database engines, as explained below.

       If you have specific questions about the integrity of your data in light of this development - please
       join us on IRC or the mailing list to further discuss your concerns with the team.

   <b>Warning</b> <b>-</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Database</b> <b>Unicode</b> <b>Support</b>
       If your database natively supports Unicode (as does SQLite with the "sqlite_unicode" connect flag, MySQL
       with "mysql_enable_utf8" connect flag or Postgres with the "pg_enable_utf8" connect flag), then this
       component should <b>not</b> be used, and will corrupt unicode data in a subtle and unexpected manner.

       It is far better to do Unicode support within the database if possible rather than converting data to and
       from raw bytes on every database round trip.

   <b>Warning</b> <b>-</b> <b>Component</b> <b>Overloading</b>
       Note that this module overloads "store_column" in DBIx::Class::Row in a way that may prevent other
       components overloading the same method from working correctly. This component must be the last one before
       DBIx::Class::Row (which is provided by DBIx::Class::Core). DBIx::Class will detect such incorrect
       component order and issue an appropriate warning, advising which components need to be loaded
       differently.
