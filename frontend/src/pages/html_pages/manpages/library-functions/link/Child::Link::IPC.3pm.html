</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Most  of this was part of Parallel::Runner intended for use in the Fennec project. Fennec is being broken
       into multiple parts, this is one such part.

</pre><h4><b>FENNEC</b> <b>PROJECT</b></h4><pre>
       This module is part of the Fennec project. See Fennec for more details.  Fennec is a project  to  develop
       an  extendable  and  powerful  testing  framework.   Together the tools that make up the Fennec framework
       provide a potent testing environment.

       The tools provided by Fennec are also useful on their own. Sometimes a tool created for Fennec is  useful
       outside the greater framework. Such tools are turned into their own projects. This is one such project.

       Fennec - The core framework
         The primary Fennec project that ties them all together.
