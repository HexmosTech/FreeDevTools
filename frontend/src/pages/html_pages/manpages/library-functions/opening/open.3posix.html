       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       open, openat — open file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/fcntl.h">fcntl.h</a>&gt;

       int open(const char *<u>path</u>, int <u>oflag</u>, ...);
       int openat(int <u>fd</u>, const char *<u>path</u>, int <u>oflag</u>, ...);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>open</u>() function shall establish the connection between a file and a file descriptor. It shall create
       an open file description that refers to a file and a file  descriptor  that  refers  to  that  open  file
       description.  The file descriptor is used by other I/O functions to refer to that file. The <u>path</u> argument
       points to a pathname naming the file.

       The  <u>open</u>() function shall return a file descriptor for the named file, allocated as described in <u>Section</u>
       <u>2.14</u>, <u>File</u> <u>Descriptor</u> <u>Allocation</u>.  The open file description is new, and therefore  the  file  descriptor
       shall  not  share it with any other process in the system. The FD_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag associated
       with the new file descriptor shall be cleared unless the O_CLOEXEC flag is set in <u>oflag</u>.

       The file offset used to mark the current position within the file shall be set to the  beginning  of  the
       file.

       The  file  status  flags and file access modes of the open file description shall be set according to the
       value of <u>oflag</u>.

       Values for <u>oflag</u> are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of flags from the following list,  defined  in
       <u>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</u>.   Applications shall specify exactly one of the first five values (file access modes) below in
       the value of <u>oflag</u>:

       O_EXEC        Open for execute only (non-directory files). The result is  unspecified  if  this  flag  is
                     applied to a directory.

       O_RDONLY      Open for reading only.

       O_RDWR        Open for reading and writing. The result is undefined if this flag is applied to a FIFO.

       O_SEARCH      Open directory for search only. The result is unspecified if this flag is applied to a non-
                     directory file.

       O_WRONLY      Open for writing only.

       Any combination of the following may be used:

       O_APPEND      If set, the file offset shall be set to the end of the file prior to each write.

       O_CLOEXEC     If set, the FD_CLOEXEC flag for the new file descriptor shall be set.

       O_CREAT       If  the file exists, this flag has no effect except as noted under O_EXCL below. Otherwise,
                     if O_DIRECTORY is not set the file shall be created as a regular file; the user ID  of  the
                     file  shall  be set to the effective user ID of the process; the group ID of the file shall
                     be set to the group ID of the file's parent directory or to the effective group ID  of  the
                     process; and the access permission bits (see <u>&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</u>) of the file mode shall be set to
                     the  value  of  the  argument following the <u>oflag</u> argument taken as type <b>mode_t</b> modified as
                     follows: a bitwise AND is performed on the file-mode bits and the corresponding bits in the
                     complement of the process' file mode creation mask. Thus, all bits in the file  mode  whose
                     corresponding  bit  in the file mode creation mask is set are cleared. When bits other than
                     the file permission bits are set, the effect is unspecified.  The  argument  following  the
                     <u>oflag</u>  argument does not affect whether the file is open for reading, writing, or for both.
                     Implementations shall provide a way to initialize the file's group ID to the  group  ID  of
                     the  parent directory. Implementations may, but need not, provide an implementation-defined
                     way to initialize the file's group ID to the effective group ID of the calling process.

       O_DIRECTORY   If <u>path</u> resolves to a non-directory file, fail and set <u>errno</u> to <b>[ENOTDIR]</b>.

       O_DSYNC       Write I/O operations on the file descriptor shall complete as defined by  synchronized  I/O
                     data integrity completion.

       O_EXCL        If  O_CREAT  and  O_EXCL  are  set, <u>open</u>() shall fail if the file exists. The check for the
                     existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not  exist  shall  be  atomic
                     with  respect  to  other  threads  executing  <u>open</u>()  naming  the same filename in the same
                     directory with O_EXCL and O_CREAT set. If O_EXCL and O_CREAT are  set,  and  <u>path</u>  names  a
                     symbolic  link,  <u>open</u>() shall fail and set <u>errno</u> to <b>[EEXIST]</b>, regardless of the contents of
                     the symbolic link. If O_EXCL is set and O_CREAT is not set, the result is undefined.

       O_NOCTTY      If set and <u>path</u> identifies a terminal device, <u>open</u>() shall not cause the terminal device to
                     become the controlling terminal for the process. If  <u>path</u>  does  not  identify  a  terminal
                     device, O_NOCTTY shall be ignored.

       O_NOFOLLOW    If <u>path</u> names a symbolic link, fail and set <u>errno</u> to <b>[ELOOP]</b>.

       O_NONBLOCK    When opening a FIFO with O_RDONLY or O_WRONLY set:

                      *  If  O_NONBLOCK is set, an <u>open</u>() for reading-only shall return without delay. An <u>open</u>()
                         for writing-only shall return an error if no process currently has the  file  open  for
                         reading.

                      *  If O_NONBLOCK is clear, an <u>open</u>() for reading-only shall block the calling thread until
                         a thread opens the file for writing. An <u>open</u>() for writing-only shall block the calling
                         thread until a thread opens the file for reading.

                     When opening a block special or character special file that supports non-blocking opens:

                      *  If  O_NONBLOCK is set, the <u>open</u>() function shall return without blocking for the device
                         to be ready or available. Subsequent behavior of the device is device-specific.

                      *  If O_NONBLOCK is clear, the <u>open</u>() function shall block the calling  thread  until  the
                         device is ready or available before returning.

                     Otherwise,  the O_NONBLOCK flag shall not cause an error, but it is unspecified whether the
                     file status flags will include the O_NONBLOCK flag.

       O_RSYNC       Read I/O operations on the file descriptor shall complete at the same level of integrity as
                     specified by the O_DSYNC and O_SYNC flags. If both O_DSYNC and O_RSYNC are  set  in  <u>oflag</u>,
                     all  I/O  operations  on  the file descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O
                     data integrity completion. If both O_SYNC and O_RSYNC are set in flags, all I/O  operations
                     on  the  file  descriptor  shall  complete  as  defined  by synchronized I/O file integrity
                     completion.

       O_SYNC        Write I/O operations on the file descriptor shall complete as defined by  synchronized  I/O
                     file integrity completion.

                     The  O_SYNC  flag  shall be supported for regular files, even if the Synchronized Input and
                     Output option is not supported.

       O_TRUNC       If the file exists and is a regular file, and the file is  successfully  opened  O_RDWR  or
                     O_WRONLY, its length shall be truncated to 0, and the mode and owner shall be unchanged. It
                     shall  have  no  effect on FIFO special files or terminal device files. Its effect on other
                     file types is implementation-defined. The result of using O_TRUNC without either O_RDWR  or
                     O_WRONLY is undefined.

       O_TTY_INIT    If  <u>path</u>  identifies  a  terminal  device  other  than a pseudo-terminal, the device is not
                     already open in any process, and either O_TTY_INIT is set in <u>oflag</u> or  O_TTY_INIT  has  the
                     value  zero,  <u>open</u>()  shall set any non-standard <b>termios</b> structure terminal parameters to a
                     state that provides conforming behavior; see the Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,
                     <u>Section</u>  <u>11.2</u>,  <u>Parameters</u>  <u>that</u>  <u>Can</u> <u>be</u> <u>Set</u>.  It is unspecified whether O_TTY_INIT has any
                     effect if the device is already open in any process. If <u>path</u> identifies the slave side of a
                     pseudo-terminal that is not already open in any process, <u>open</u>() shall set any  non-standard
                     <b>termios</b>  structure  terminal  parameters  to  a  state  that  provides conforming behavior,
                     regardless of whether O_TTY_INIT is set. If <u>path</u>  does  not  identify  a  terminal  device,
                     O_TTY_INIT shall be ignored.

       If  O_CREAT  and  O_DIRECTORY  are  set and the requested access mode is neither O_WRONLY nor O_RDWR, the
       result is unspecified.

       If O_CREAT is set and the file did not previously exist, upon successful completion,  <u>open</u>()  shall  mark
       for  update  the  last data access, last data modification, and last file status change timestamps of the
       file and the last data modification and last file status change timestamps of the parent directory.

       If O_TRUNC is set and the file did previously exist, upon successful completion, <u>open</u>()  shall  mark  for
       update the last data modification and last file status change timestamps of the file.

       If both the O_SYNC and O_DSYNC flags are set, the effect is as if only the O_SYNC flag was set.

       If  <u>path</u>  refers  to a STREAMS file, <u>oflag</u> may be constructed from O_NONBLOCK OR'ed with either O_RDONLY,
       O_WRONLY, or O_RDWR. Other flag values are not applicable to STREAMS devices and shall have no effect  on
       them. The value O_NONBLOCK affects the operation of STREAMS drivers and certain functions applied to file
       descriptors  associated  with  STREAMS  files.  For  STREAMS drivers, the implementation of O_NONBLOCK is
       device-specific.

       The application shall ensure that it specifies the O_TTY_INIT flag on the first open of a terminal device
       since system boot or since the device was closed by the process that last had it  open.  The  application
       need  not  specify the O_TTY_INIT flag when opening pseudo-terminals.  If <u>path</u> names the master side of a
       pseudo-terminal device, then it is unspecified whether <u>open</u>() locks the slave side so that it  cannot  be
       opened. Conforming applications shall call <u>unlockpt</u>() before opening the slave side.

       The  largest  value  that can be represented correctly in an object of type <b>off_t</b> shall be established as
       the offset maximum in the open file description.

       The <u>openat</u>() function shall be equivalent to the <u>open</u>() function except in the case where <u>path</u>  specifies
       a  relative  path.  In this case the file to be opened is determined relative to the directory associated
       with the file descriptor <u>fd</u> instead of the current working directory. If the access mode of the open file
       description associated with the file descriptor  is  not  O_SEARCH,  the  function  shall  check  whether
       directory  searches  are  permitted  using  the  current permissions of the directory underlying the file
       descriptor. If the access mode is O_SEARCH, the function shall not perform the check.

       The <u>oflag</u> parameter and the optional fourth parameter correspond exactly to the parameters of <u>open</u>().

       If <u>openat</u>() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <u>fd</u> parameter, the current working directory shall
       be used and the behavior shall be identical to a call to <u>open</u>().

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall  open  the  file  and  return  a  non-negative  integer
       representing  the  file descriptor.  Otherwise, these functions shall return -1 and set <u>errno</u> to indicate
       the error. If -1 is returned, no files shall be created or modified.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> Search permission is denied on a component of  the  path  prefix,  or  the  file  exists  and  the
              permissions  specified  by  <u>oflag</u>  are  denied, or the file does not exist and write permission is
              denied for the parent directory of the file to be created,  or  O_TRUNC  is  specified  and  write

              string.

       <b>ENOENT</b> or <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              O_CREAT is set, and the <u>path</u> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt; character  and  ends  with
              one  or  more  trailing  &lt;slash&gt; characters. If <u>path</u> without the trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters would
              name an existing file, an <b>[ENOENT]</b> error shall not occur.

       <b>ENOSR</b>  The <u>path</u> argument names a STREAMS-based file and the system is unable to allocate a STREAM.

       <b>ENOSPC</b> The directory or file system that would contain the new file cannot be expanded, the file does not
              exist, and O_CREAT is specified.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that is neither a directory nor  a  symbolic
              link  to a directory; or O_CREAT and O_EXCL are not specified, the <u>path</u> argument contains at least
              one non-&lt;slash&gt; character and ends with one or more trailing  &lt;slash&gt;  characters,  and  the  last

              special file does not exist.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The  named  file  is a regular file and the size of the file cannot be represented correctly in an
              object of type <b>off_t</b>.

       <b>EROFS</b>  The named file resides on a read-only file system and either O_WRONLY,  O_RDWR,  O_CREAT  (if  the
              file does not exist), or O_TRUNC is set in the <u>oflag</u> argument.

       The <u>openat</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> The  access  mode  of  the  open  file  description  associated  with  <u>fd</u>  is not O_SEARCH and the

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Opening</b> <b>a</b> <b>File</b> <b>for</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Owner</b>
       The  following example opens the file <b>/tmp/file</b>, either by creating it (if it does not already exist), or
       by truncating its length to 0 (if it does exist). In the former case, if the call creates a new file, the
       access permission bits in the file mode of the file are set to permit reading and writing by  the  owner,
       and to permit reading only by group members and others.

       If the call to <u>open</u>() is successful, the file is opened for writing.

           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/fcntl.h">fcntl.h</a>&gt;
           ...
           int fd;
           mode_t mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH;
           char *pathname = "/tmp/file";
           ...
           fd = open(pathname, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, mode);
           ...

   <b>Opening</b> <b>a</b> <b>File</b> <b>Using</b> <b>an</b> <b>Existence</b> <b>Check</b>
       The  following  example  uses  the  <u>open</u>()  function  to  try to create the <b>LOCKFILE</b> file and open it for
       writing. Since the <u>open</u>() function specifies the O_EXCL flag, the call fails if the file already  exists.
       In that case, the program assumes that someone else is updating the password file and exits.

           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/fcntl.h">fcntl.h</a>&gt;
           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;
           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;

           #define LOCKFILE "/etc/ptmp"
           ...
           int pfd; /* Integer for file descriptor returned by open() call. */
           ...
           if ((pfd = open(LOCKFILE, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_EXCL,
               S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH)) == -1)
           {
               fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open /etc/ptmp. Try again later.\n");
               <a href="../man1/exit.1.html">exit</a>(1);
           }
           ...

   <b>Opening</b> <b>a</b> <b>File</b> <b>for</b> <b>Writing</b>
       The  following  example  opens a file for writing, creating the file if it does not already exist. If the
       file does exist, the system truncates the file to zero bytes.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.1‐2008 does not require that terminal parameters be automatically set to any state on  first  open,
       nor  that  they be reset after the last close. It is possible for a non-conforming application to leave a
       terminal device in a state where the next process to use that device finds it in a non-conforming  state,
       but  has  no  way  of  determining  this. To ensure that the device is set to a conforming initial state,
       applications which perform a first open of a terminal (other than a pseudo-terminal) should do  so  using
       the O_TTY_INIT flag to set the parameters associated with the terminal to a conforming state.

       Except as specified in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, the flags allowed in <u>oflag</u> are not mutually-exclusive
       and any number of them may be used simultaneously. Not all combinations of flags make sense. For example,
       using  O_SEARCH  | O_CREAT will successfully open a pre-existing directory for searching, but if there is
       no existing file by that name, then it is unspecified whether a regular file will be  created.  Likewise,
       if  a  non-directory  file descriptor is successfully returned, it is unspecified whether that descriptor
       will have execute permissions as if by O_EXEC (note that it is unspecified whether  O_EXEC  and  O_SEARCH
       have the same value).

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Some  implementations  permit  opening FIFOs with O_RDWR. Since FIFOs could be implemented in other ways,
       and since two file descriptors can be used to the same effect, this possibility is left as undefined.

       See <u>getgroups</u>() about the group of a newly created file.

       The use of <u>open</u>() to create a regular file is preferable to the use of <u>creat</u>(),  because  the  latter  is
       redundant and included only for historical reasons.

       The  use  of  the  O_TRUNC  flag on FIFOs and directories (pipes cannot be <u>open</u>()-ed) must be permissible
       without unexpected side-effects (for example, <u>creat</u>() on a FIFO must not  remove  data).  Since  terminal
       special  files  might have type-ahead data stored in the buffer, O_TRUNC should not affect their content,
       particularly if a program that normally opens a regular file should open the current controlling terminal
       instead. Other file types, particularly implementation-defined ones, are left implementation-defined.

       POSIX.1‐2008 permits <b>[EACCES]</b> to be returned for conditions other than those explicitly listed.

       The O_NOCTTY flag was added to allow  applications  to  avoid  unintentionally  acquiring  a  controlling
       terminal  as a side-effect of opening a terminal file. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify how a
       controlling terminal is acquired, but it allows an implementation  to  provide  this  on  <u>open</u>()  if  the
       O_NOCTTY  flag  is not set and other conditions specified in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
       <u>Chapter</u> <u>11</u>, <u>General</u> <u>Terminal</u> <u>Interface</u> are met.

       In historical implementations the value of O_RDONLY is zero. Because of  that,  it  is  not  possible  to
       detect  the  presence  of  O_RDONLY and another option. Future implementations should encode O_RDONLY and
       O_WRONLY as bit flags so that:

           O_RDONLY | O_WRONLY == O_RDWR

       O_EXEC and O_SEARCH are specified as two of the five file access modes.  Since O_EXEC does not  apply  to
       directories,  and O_SEARCH only applies to directories, their values need not be distinct. Since O_RDONLY
       has historically had the value zero, implementations are not able to  distinguish  between  O_SEARCH  and
       O_SEARCH | O_RDONLY, and similarly for O_EXEC.

       In  general,  the  <u>open</u>()  function follows the symbolic link if <u>path</u> names a symbolic link. However, the
       <u>open</u>() function, when called with O_CREAT and O_EXCL, is required to fail with <b>[EEXIST]</b> if <u>path</u> names  an
       existing symbolic link, even if the symbolic link refers to a nonexistent file. This behavior is required
       so  that privileged applications can create a new file in a known location without the possibility that a
       symbolic link might cause the file to be created in a different location.

       For example, a privileged application that must create a file with a predictable name in a  user-writable
       directory,  such  as  the user's home directory, could be compromised if the user creates a symbolic link
       with that name that refers to a nonexistent file in a system directory. If the  user  can  influence  the
       contents  of a file, the user could compromise the system by creating a new system configuration or spool
       file that would then be interpreted by the system. The test  for  a  symbolic  link  which  refers  to  a
       nonexisting file must be atomic with the creation of a new file.

       In  addition,  the  <u>open</u>()  function refuses to open non-directories if the O_DIRECTORY flag is set. This
       avoids race conditions whereby a user might compromise the system  by  substituting  a  hard  link  to  a
       sensitive file (e.g., a device or a FIFO) while a privileged application is running, where opening a file
       even for read access might have undesirable side-effects.

       In  addition,  the  <u>open</u>()  function  does not follow symbolic links if the O_NOFOLLOW flag is set.  This
       avoids race conditions whereby a user might compromise the system by substituting a symbolic  link  to  a
       sensitive  file (e.g., a device) while a privileged application is running, where opening a file even for
       read access might have undesirable side-effects.

       The POSIX.1‐1990 standard required that the group ID of a newly created file be set to the  group  ID  of
       its  parent  directory  or  to  the  effective group ID of the creating process. FIPS 151‐2 required that
       implementations provide a way to have the group ID be set to the group ID of  the  containing  directory,
       but  did not prohibit implementations also supporting a way to set the group ID to the effective group ID
       of the creating process.  Conforming applications should not assume which group ID will be  used.  If  it
       matters, an application can use <u>chown</u>() to set the group ID after the file is created, or determine under
       what conditions the implementation will set the desired group ID.

       The  purpose  of  the  <u>openat</u>() function is to enable opening files in directories other than the current
       working directory without exposure to race conditions. Any part of the path of a file could be changed in
       parallel to a call to <u>open</u>(), resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a  file  descriptor  for  the
       target  directory  and  using  the <u>openat</u>() function it can be guaranteed that the opened file is located
       relative to the desired directory. Some implementations use the <u>openat</u>() function for other  purposes  as
       well.  In  some  cases,  if  the  <u>oflag</u>  parameter  has the O_XATTR bit set, the returned file descriptor
       provides access to extended attributes. This functionality is not standardized here.
