       SSL_get_options, SSL_get_secure_renegotiation_support - manipulate SSL options

        long SSL_get_secure_renegotiation_support(SSL *ssl);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_CTX_set_options()</b> adds the options set via bit-mask in <b>options</b> to <b>ctx</b>.  <b>ctx</b> <b>MUST</b> <b>NOT</b> be NULL.
       Options already set before are not cleared!

       <b>SSL_set_options()</b> adds the options set via bit-mask in <b>options</b> to <b>ssl</b>.  Options already set before are
       not cleared!

       <b>SSL_CTX_clear_options()</b> clears the options set via bit-mask in <b>options</b> to <b>ctx</b>.

       <b>SSL_clear_options()</b> clears the options set via bit-mask in <b>options</b> to <b>ssl</b>.

       <b>SSL_CTX_get_options()</b> returns the options set for <b>ctx</b>.

       <b>SSL_get_options()</b> returns the options set for <b>ssl</b>.

       <b>SSL_get_secure_renegotiation_support()</b> indicates whether the peer supports secure renegotiation.  Note,
       this is implemented via a macro.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The behaviour of the SSL library can be changed by setting several options.  The options are coded as
       bit-masks and can be combined by a bitwise <b>or</b> operation (|).

       <b>SSL_CTX_set_options()</b> and <b>SSL_set_options()</b> affect the (external) protocol behaviour of the SSL library.
       The (internal) behaviour of the API can be changed by using the similar <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_mode.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_mode</a></b>(3) and
       <b>SSL_set_mode()</b> functions.

       During a handshake, the option settings of the SSL object are used. When a new SSL object is created from
       a context using <b>SSL_new()</b>, the current option setting is copied. Changes to <b>ctx</b> do not affect already
       created SSL objects. <b>SSL_clear()</b> does not affect the settings.

       The following <b>bug</b> <b>workaround</b> options are available:

       SSL_OP_CRYPTOPRO_TLSEXT_BUG
           Add  server-hello  extension  from  the  early  version  of  cryptopro draft when GOST ciphersuite is
           negotiated. Required for interoperability with CryptoPro CSP 3.x.

       SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS
           Disables a countermeasure against an SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 protocol vulnerability  affecting  CBC  ciphers,
           which  cannot  be  handled  by  some  broken  SSL  implementations.   This  option  has no effect for
           connections using other ciphers.

       SSL_OP_SAFARI_ECDHE_ECDSA_BUG
           Don't prefer ECDHE-ECDSA ciphers when the client appears to be Safari on OS X.  OS X 10.8..10.8.3 has
           broken support for ECDHE-ECDSA ciphers.

       SSL_OP_TLSEXT_PADDING
           Adds a padding extension to ensure the ClientHello size is never between 256 and 511 bytes in length.
           This is needed as a workaround for some implementations.

       SSL_OP_ALL
           All of the above bug workarounds.

       It is usually safe to use <b>SSL_OP_ALL</b> to enable the bug workaround options if compatibility with  somewhat
       broken implementations is desired.

       The following <b>modifying</b> options are available:

       SSL_OP_ALLOW_CLIENT_RENEGOTIATION
           Client-initiated renegotiation is disabled by default. Use this option to enable it.

       SSL_OP_ALLOW_NO_DHE_KEX
           In  TLSv1.3  allow a non-(ec)dhe based key exchange mode on resumption. This means that there will be
           no forward secrecy for the resumed session.

       SSL_OP_PREFER_NO_DHE_KEX
           In TLSv1.3, on resumption let the server prefer a non-(ec)dhe based key exchange mode over an (ec)dhe
           based one. Ignored without <b>SSL_OP_ALLOW_NO_DHE_KEX</b> being set as well. Always ignored on the client.

       SSL_OP_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION
           Allow legacy insecure renegotiation between OpenSSL and unpatched clients or servers. See the  <b>SECURE</b>
           <b>RENEGOTIATION</b> section for more details.

       SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE
           When choosing a cipher, use the server's preferences instead of the client preferences. When not set,
           the  SSL  server will always follow the clients preferences. When set, the SSL/TLS server will choose
           following its own preferences.

       SSL_OP_CISCO_ANYCONNECT
           Use Cisco's version identifier of DTLS_BAD_VER when establishing a DTLSv1 connection. Only  available
           when using the deprecated <b>DTLSv1_client_method()</b> API.

       SSL_OP_CLEANSE_PLAINTEXT
           By  default  TLS  and QUIC SSL objects keep a copy of received plaintext application data in a static
           buffer until it is overwritten by the next portion of data.  When  enabling  SSL_OP_CLEANSE_PLAINTEXT
           deciphered  application  data  is  cleansed  by  calling <b><a href="../man3/OPENSSL_cleanse.3.html">OPENSSL_cleanse</a></b>(3) after passing data to the
           application. Data is also cleansed when releasing the connection (e.g. <b><a href="../man3/SSL_free.3.html">SSL_free</a></b>(3)).

           Since OpenSSL only cleanses internal buffers, the application is still responsible for cleansing  all
           other  buffers.  Most  notably,  this  applies  to  buffers  passed  to  functions  like <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read.3.html">SSL_read</a></b>(3),
           <b><a href="../man3/SSL_peek.3.html">SSL_peek</a></b>(3) but also like <b><a href="../man3/SSL_write.3.html">SSL_write</a></b>(3).

           TLS connections do not buffer data to be sent in plaintext. QUIC stream objects do  buffer  plaintext
           data to be sent and this option will also cause that data to be cleansed when it is discarded.

           This  option  can  be  set  differently  on  individual QUIC stream objects and has no effect on QUIC
           connection objects (except where a default stream is being used).

       SSL_OP_COOKIE_EXCHANGE
           Turn on Cookie Exchange as described in RFC4347 Section 4.2.1. Only affects DTLS connections.

       SSL_OP_DISABLE_TLSEXT_CA_NAMES
           Disable TLS Extension CA Names. You may want to disable it for security reasons or for  compatibility
           with some Windows TLS implementations crashing when this extension is larger than 1024 bytes.

       SSL_OP_ENABLE_KTLS
           Enable  the  use  of  kernel TLS. In order to benefit from kernel TLS OpenSSL must have been compiled
           with support for it, and it must be supported by the  negotiated  ciphersuites  and  extensions.  The
           specific ciphersuites and extensions that are supported may vary by platform and kernel version.

           The  kernel  TLS data-path implements the record layer, and the encryption algorithm. The kernel will
           utilize the best hardware available for encryption. Using the  kernel  data-path  should  reduce  the
           memory  footprint  of  OpenSSL  because no buffering is required. Also, the throughput should improve
           because data copy is avoided when user data is encrypted into kernel  memory  instead  of  the  usual
           encrypt then copy to kernel.

           Kernel  TLS  might  not support all the features of OpenSSL. For instance, renegotiation, and setting
           the maximum fragment size is not possible as of Linux 4.20.

           Note that with kernel TLS enabled some cryptographic operations are performed by the kernel  directly
           and  not  via  any  available  OpenSSL  Providers.  This  might  be  undesirable if, for example, the
           application requires all cryptographic operations to be performed by the FIPS provider.

       SSL_OP_ENABLE_KTLS_TX_ZEROCOPY_SENDFILE
           With this option, <b>sendfile()</b> will use the zerocopy mode, which gives a performance  boost  when  used
           with KTLS hardware offload. Note that invalid TLS records might be transmitted if the file is changed
           while being sent. This option has no effect if <b>SSL_OP_ENABLE_KTLS</b> is not enabled.

           This  option  only  applies  to  Linux.  KTLS  sendfile on FreeBSD doesn't offer an option to disable
           zerocopy and always runs in this mode.

       SSL_OP_ENABLE_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT
           If set then dummy Change Cipher Spec (CCS) messages are sent in  TLSv1.3.  This  has  the  effect  of
           making  TLSv1.3  look  more  like TLSv1.2 so that middleboxes that do not understand TLSv1.3 will not
           drop the connection. Regardless of whether this option is set or not CCS messages received  from  the
           peer  will  always  be  ignored  in  TLSv1.3.  This  option  is  set by default. To switch it off use
           <b>SSL_clear_options()</b>. A future version of OpenSSL may not set this by default.

       SSL_OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF
           Some TLS implementations do not send the mandatory close_notify alert on shutdown. If the application
           tries to wait for the close_notify alert but the peer closes the connection without  sending  it,  an
           error is generated. When this option is enabled the peer does not need to send the close_notify alert
           and a closed connection will be treated as if the close_notify alert was received.

           You  should  only  enable this option if the protocol running over TLS can detect a truncation attack
           itself, and that the application is checking for that truncation attack.

           For more information on shutting down a connection, see <b><a href="../man3/SSL_shutdown.3.html">SSL_shutdown</a></b>(3).

       SSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT
           Allow legacy insecure renegotiation between OpenSSL  and  unpatched  servers  <b>only</b>.  See  the  <b>SECURE</b>
           <b>RENEGOTIATION</b> section for more details.

       SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY
           By  default,  when  a  server  is  configured for early data (i.e., max_early_data &gt; 0), OpenSSL will
           switch on replay protection. See <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read_early_data.3.html">SSL_read_early_data</a></b>(3) for a description of  the  replay  protection
           feature.   Anti-replay  measures  are  required  to  comply  with  the  TLSv1.3  specification.  Some
           applications may be able to mitigate the replay risks in other ways and in such cases  the  built  in
           OpenSSL  functionality  is not required. Those applications can turn this feature off by setting this
           option. This is a server-side option only. It is ignored by clients.

       SSL_OP_NO_TX_CERTIFICATE_COMPRESSION
           Normally clients and  servers  will  transparently  attempt  to  negotiate  the  RFC8879  certificate
           compression option on TLSv1.3 connections.

           If  this  option is set, the certificate compression extension is ignored upon receipt and compressed
           certificates will not be sent to the peer.

       SSL_OP_NO_RX_CERTIFICATE_COMPRESSION
           Normally clients and  servers  will  transparently  attempt  to  negotiate  the  RFC8879  certificate
           compression option on TLSv1.3 connections.

           If  this  option  is  set,  the  certificate  compression  extension  will not be sent and compressed
           certificates will not be accepted from the peer.

       SSL_OP_NO_COMPRESSION
           Do not use TLS record compression even if it is supported. This option is set by default.  To  switch
           it  off  use  <b>SSL_clear_options()</b>.  Note  that  TLS  record compression is not recommended and is not
           available at security level 2 or above. From OpenSSL 3.2 the default security level is 2, so clearing
           this  option  will  have  no  effect  without  also  changing  the  default   security   level.   See
           <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_security_level</a></b>(3).

       SSL_OP_NO_ENCRYPT_THEN_MAC
           Normally  clients  and  servers  will transparently attempt to negotiate the RFC7366 Encrypt-then-MAC
           option on TLS and DTLS connection.

           If this option is set, Encrypt-then-MAC is disabled. Clients will not propose, and servers  will  not
           accept the extension.

       SSL_OP_NO_EXTENDED_MASTER_SECRET
           Normally  clients  and  servers  will  transparently attempt to negotiate the RFC7627 Extended Master
           Secret option on TLS and DTLS connection.

           If this option is set, Extended Master Secret is disabled. Clients will not propose, and servers will
           not accept the extension.

       SSL_OP_NO_QUERY_MTU
           Do not query the MTU. Only affects DTLS connections.

       SSL_OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION
           Disable all renegotiation in TLSv1.2 and earlier. Do  not  send  HelloRequest  messages,  and  ignore
           renegotiation requests via ClientHello.

       SSL_OP_NO_SESSION_RESUMPTION_ON_RENEGOTIATION
           When  performing  renegotiation  as  a  server,  always start a new session (i.e., session resumption
           requests are only accepted in the initial handshake). This option is not needed for clients.

       SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3, SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1, SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1, SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_2, SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_3,
       SSL_OP_NO_DTLSv1, SSL_OP_NO_DTLSv1_2
           These options turn off the SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 protocol versions  with  TLS  or
           the  DTLSv1,  DTLSv1.2  versions  with  DTLS,  respectively.   As of OpenSSL 1.1.0, these options are
           deprecated, use <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version</a></b>(3) and <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_max_proto_version.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_max_proto_version</a></b>(3) instead.

       SSL_OP_NO_TICKET
           SSL/TLS supports two mechanisms for resuming sessions: session ids and stateless session tickets.

           When using session ids a copy of the session information is cached on the server and a unique  id  is
           sent to the client. When the client wishes to resume it provides the unique id so that the server can
           retrieve the session information from its cache.

           When  using  stateless session tickets the server uses a session ticket encryption key to encrypt the
           session information. This encrypted data is sent to the client as a "ticket". When the client  wishes
           to resume it sends the encrypted data back to the server. The server uses its key to decrypt the data
           and resume the session. In this way the server can operate statelessly - no session information needs
           to be cached locally.

           The  TLSv1.3  protocol  only  supports  tickets  and  does not directly support session ids. However,
           OpenSSL allows two modes of ticket operation in TLSv1.3: stateful and  stateless.  Stateless  tickets
           work the same way as in TLSv1.2 and below.  Stateful tickets mimic the session id behaviour available
           in  TLSv1.2 and below.  The session information is cached on the server and the session id is wrapped
           up in a ticket and sent back to the client. When the client wishes to resume, it presents a ticket in
           the same way as for stateless tickets. The server can then extract the session id from the ticket and
           retrieve the session information from its cache.

           By default OpenSSL will use stateless tickets.  The  SSL_OP_NO_TICKET  option  will  cause  stateless
           tickets  to  not be issued. In TLSv1.2 and below this means no ticket gets sent to the client at all.
           In TLSv1.3 a stateful ticket will be sent. This is a server-side option only.

           In TLSv1.3 it is possible to suppress all tickets (stateful and stateless) from being sent by calling
           <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_num_tickets.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_num_tickets</a></b>(3) or <b><a href="../man3/SSL_set_num_tickets.3.html">SSL_set_num_tickets</a></b>(3).

       SSL_OP_PRIORITIZE_CHACHA
           When SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE is set, temporarily reprioritize  ChaCha20-Poly1305  ciphers  to
           the  top  of  the server cipher list if a ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher is at the top of the client cipher
           list. This helps those clients (e.g. mobile) use ChaCha20-Poly1305 if that cipher is anywhere in  the
           server  cipher  list;  but  still  allows  other  clients  to  use  AES  and  other ciphers. Requires
           <b>SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE</b>.

       SSL_OP_TLS_ROLLBACK_BUG
           Disable version rollback attack detection.

           During the client key exchange, the client must send the same information  about  acceptable  SSL/TLS
           protocol levels as during the first hello. Some clients violate this rule by adapting to the server's
           answer.  (Example:  the  client sends an SSLv2 hello and accepts up to SSLv3.1=TLSv1, the server only
           understands up to SSLv3. In this case the client must still use the same SSLv3.1=TLSv1  announcement.
           Some  clients step down to SSLv3 with respect to the server's answer and violate the version rollback
           protection.)

       The following options no longer have any effect but their  identifiers  are  retained  for  compatibility
       purposes:

       SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG
       SSL_OP_MICROSOFT_BIG_SSLV3_BUFFER

</pre><h4><b>SECURE</b> <b>RENEGOTIATION</b></h4><pre>
       OpenSSL  always  attempts  to  use secure renegotiation as described in RFC5746. This counters the prefix
       attack described in CVE-2009-3555 and elsewhere.

       This attack has far  reaching  consequences  which  application  writers  should  be  aware  of.  In  the
       description  below  an implementation supporting secure renegotiation is referred to as <u>patched</u>. A server
       not supporting secure renegotiation is referred to as <u>unpatched</u>.

       The  following  sections  describe  the  operations   permitted   by   OpenSSL's   secure   renegotiation
       implementation.

   <b>Patched</b> <b>client</b> <b>and</b> <b>server</b>
       Connections and renegotiation are always permitted by OpenSSL implementations.

   <b>Unpatched</b> <b>client</b> <b>and</b> <b>patched</b> <b>OpenSSL</b> <b>server</b>
       The  initial connection succeeds but client renegotiation is denied by the server with a <b>no_renegotiation</b>
       warning alert if TLS v1.0 is used or a fatal <b>handshake_failure</b> alert in SSL v3.0.

       If the patched OpenSSL server attempts to renegotiate a fatal <b>handshake_failure</b> alert is  sent.  This  is
       because the server code may be unaware of the unpatched nature of the client.

       If the option <b>SSL_OP_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION</b> is set then renegotiation <b>always</b> succeeds.

   <b>Patched</b> <b>OpenSSL</b> <b>client</b> <b>and</b> <b>unpatched</b> <b>server</b>
       If  the  option  <b>SSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT</b>  or  <b>SSL_OP_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION</b>  is  set then
       initial connections and renegotiation between patched OpenSSL clients and unpatched servers succeeds.  If
       neither option is set then initial connections to unpatched servers will fail.

       Setting  the  option  <b>SSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT</b> has security implications; clients that are willing to
       connect to servers that do not implement RFC 5746 secure renegotiation are subject  to  attacks  such  as
       CVE-2009-3555.

       OpenSSL  client  applications  wishing  to ensure they can connect to unpatched servers should always <b>set</b>
       <b>SSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT</b>

       OpenSSL client applications that want to ensure they can <b>not</b> connect to unpatched servers (and thus avoid
       any security issues) should always <b>clear</b> <b>SSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT</b>  using  <b>SSL_CTX_clear_options()</b>  or
       <b>SSL_clear_options()</b>.

       The  difference  between  the  <b>SSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT</b>  and <b>SSL_OP_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION</b>
       options is that <b>SSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT</b> enables initial connections and secure renegotiation between
       OpenSSL clients and unpatched servers <b>only</b>, while <b>SSL_OP_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION</b> allows initial
       connections and renegotiation between OpenSSL and unpatched clients or servers.

   <b>Applicability</b> <b>of</b> <b>options</b> <b>to</b> <b>QUIC</b> <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> <b>streams</b>
       These options apply to SSL objects referencing a QUIC connection:

       SSL_OP_ALLOW_NO_DHE_KEX
       SSL_OP_NO_TX_CERTIFICATE_COMPRESSION
       SSL_OP_NO_RX_CERTIFICATE_COMPRESSION
       SSL_OP_NO_TICKET
       SSL_OP_PRIORITIZE_CHACHA

       These options apply to SSL objects referencing a QUIC stream:

       SSL_OP_CLEANSE_PLAINTEXT

       Options on QUIC connections are initialized from the options set on SSL_CTX before a QUIC connection  SSL
       object  is  created.  Options  on  QUIC  streams  are initialised from the options configured on the QUIC
       connection SSL object they are created from.

       Setting options which relate to QUIC streams on a QUIC connection SSL object has no direct effect on  the
       QUIC  connection  SSL  object  itself, but will change the options set on the default stream (if there is
       one) and will also determine the default options set on any future streams which are created.

       Other options not mentioned above do not have an effect and will be ignored.

       Options which relate to QUIC streams may also be  set  directly  on  QUIC  stream  SSL  objects.  Setting
       connection-related options on such an object has no effect.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_CTX_set_options()</b> and <b>SSL_set_options()</b> return the new options bit-mask after adding <b>options</b>.

       <b>SSL_CTX_clear_options()</b> and <b>SSL_clear_options()</b> return the new options bit-mask after clearing <b>options</b>.

       <b>SSL_CTX_get_options()</b> and <b>SSL_get_options()</b> return the current bit-mask.

       <b>SSL_get_secure_renegotiation_support()</b>  returns  1  is the peer supports secure renegotiation and 0 if it
       does not.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The attempt to always try to use secure renegotiation was added in OpenSSL 0.9.8m.

       The <b>SSL_OP_PRIORITIZE_CHACHA</b> and <b>SSL_OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION</b> options were added in OpenSSL 1.1.1.

       The <b>SSL_OP_NO_EXTENDED_MASTER_SECRET</b> and <b>SSL_OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF</b> options were added in OpenSSL 3.0.

       The  <b>SSL_OP_</b>  constants  and the corresponding parameter and return values of the affected functions were
       changed to "uint64_t" type in OpenSSL 3.0.  For that reason it is no  longer  possible  use  the  <b>SSL_OP_</b>
       macro  values in preprocessor "#if" conditions. However it is still possible to test whether these macros
       are defined or not.
