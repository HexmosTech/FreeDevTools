</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Amazon::S3::Tools - command line tools for Amazon S3

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         s3acl [options] [[bucket|bucket/key] ...]
         s3ls [options]
         s3ls [options] [ bucket/item ... ]
         s3get [options] [ bucket/item ... ]
         s3put [options] [ bucket/item ... ]
         s3mkbucket [options] [ bucket ... ]
         s3rmbucket [options] [ bucket ... ]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Each of the tools have their own specific command line options, but the also all share some common
       command line options, which are described here.

       <b>--help</b>
           Print a brief help message and exits.

       <b>--man</b>
           Prints the manual page and exits.

       <b>--verbose</b>
           Output what is being done as it is done.

       <b>--access-key</b> and <b>--secret-key</b>
           Specify  the  "AWS Access Key Identifiers" for the AWS account.  <b>--access-key</b> is the "Access Key ID",
           and <b>--secret-key</b> is the "Secret Access Key".  These are effectively the "username" and "password"  to
           the AWS account, and should be kept confidential.

           The  access  keys  MUST  be  specified,  either  via  these  command  line  parameters,  or  via  the
           <b>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</b> and <b>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET</b> environment variables.

           Specifying them on the command line overrides the environment variables.

       <b>--secure</b>
           Uses SSL/TLS HTTPS to communicate with the AWS service, instead of HTTP.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These S3 command line tools  allow  you  to  manipulate  and  populate  an  S3  account.   Refer  to  the
       documentation (pod and man) for each of the tools.

       This  Net::Amazon::S3::Tools  module is mostly just a stub, to hoist the bundling and installation of the
       executable scripts that make up the actual tools.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Report bugs to Mark Atwood <a href="mailto:mark@fallenpegasus.com">mark@fallenpegasus.com</a>.

       Occasionally the S3 service will randomly fail for no externally apparent  reason.   When  that  happens,
       these tools should retry, with a delay and a backoff.

       Access  to  the  S3 service can be authenticated with a X.509 certificate, instead of via the "AWS Access
       Key Identifiers".  These tools should support that.

       It might be useful to be able to specify the "AWS Access Key Identifiers" in the user's "<a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a>"  file.
       These tools should support that.

       Errors and warnings are very "Perl-ish", and can be confusing.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       These tools use the Net::Amazon::S3 Perl module.

       The Amazon Simple Storage Service is documented at &lt;<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">http://aws.amazon.com/s3</a>&gt;.
