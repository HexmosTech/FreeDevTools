</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Yath::Options - Tools for defining and tracking yath CLI options.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class represents a collection of options, and holds the logic for processing them. This package also
       exports sugar to help you define options.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package My::Options;

           use App::Yath::Options;

           # This package now has a package instance of options, which can be obtained
           # via the options() method.
           my $options = __PACKAGE__-&gt;options;

           # We can include options from other packages
           include_options(
               'Package::With::Options::A',
               'Package::With::Options::B',
               ...,
           );

           # Define an option group with some options
           option_group { %common_fields } =&gt; sub {

               # Define an option
               option foo =&gt; (
                   type =&gt; 's',
                   default =&gt; "FOOOOOOO",
                   category =&gt; 'foo',
                   description =&gt; "This is foo"
                   long_examples =&gt; [' value'],
                   ...
               );

               option bar =&gt; ( ... );
               ...
           };

           # Action to call right after options are parsed.
           post sub {
               my %params = @_;

               ...
           };

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       $opts = <b>options()</b>
       $opts = $class-&gt;<b>options()</b>
           This returns the options instance associated with your package.

       include_options(@CLASSES)
           This lets you include options defined in other packages.

       option_group \%COMMON_FIELDS =&gt; sub { ... }
           An  option  group  is  simply  a  block  where  all  calls  to option() will have common fields added
           automatically, this makes it easier to define multiple  options  that  share  common  fields.  Common
           fields can be overridden inside the option definition.

           These are both equivalent:

               # Using option group
               option_group { category =&gt; 'foo', prefix =&gt; 'foo' } =&gt; sub {
                   option a =&gt; (type =&gt; 'b');
                   option b =&gt; (type =&gt; 's');
               };

               # Not using option group
               option a =&gt; (type =&gt; 'b', category =&gt; 'foo', prefix =&gt; 'foo');
               option b =&gt; (type =&gt; 's', category =&gt; 'foo', prefix =&gt; 'foo');

       option TITLE =&gt; %FIELDS
           Define an option. The first argument is the "title" attribute for the new option, all other arguments
           should  be  attribute/value  pairs  used  to  construct  the  option.  See  App::Yath::Option for the
           documentation of attributes.

       post sub { ... }
       post $weight =&gt; sub { ... }
           "post" callbacks are run after all command line arguments have been processed.  This is  a  place  to
           verify the result of several options combined, sanity check, or even add short-circuit behavior. This
           is how the "--help" and "--show-opts" options are implemented.

           If  no  $weight  is  specified then 0 is used. "post" callbacks or sorted based on weight with higher
           values being run later.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>INSTANCES</b></h4><pre>
       In general you should not be using the  options  instance  directly.  Options  instances  are  mostly  an
       implementation  detail  that  should  be treated as a black box. There are however a few valid reasons to
       interact with them directly. In those cases there are a few public attributes/methods you can work  with.
       This section documents the public interface.

   <b>ATTRIBUTES</b>
       This section only lists attributes that may be useful to people working with options instances. There are
       a  lot  of  internal  (to  yath)  attributes  that  are  implementation details that are not listed here.
       Attributes not listed here are not intended for external use and may change at any time.

       $arrayref = $options-&gt;all
           Arrayref containing all the App::Yath::Option instances in the options instance.

       $settings = $options-&gt;settings
           Get the Test2::Harness::Settings instance.

       $arrayref = $options-&gt;args
           Get the reference to the list of command line arguments. This  list  is  modified  as  arguments  are
           processed, there are no guarentees about what is in here at any given stage of argument processing.

       $class_name = $options-&gt;command_class
           If yath has determined what command is being executed this will be populated with that command class.
           This will be undefined if the class has not been determined yet.

       $arrayref = $options-&gt;used_plugins
           This is a list of all plugins who's options have been used. Plugins may appear more than once.

       $hashref = $options-&gt;included
           A  hashref  where every key is a package who's options have been included into this options instance.
           The values are an implementation detail, do not rely on them.

   <b>METHODS</b>
       This section only lists methods that may be useful to people working with options instances. There are  a
       lot  of  internal (to yath) methods that are implementation details that are not listed here. Methods not
       listed here are not intended for external use and may change at any time.

       $opt = $options-&gt;option(%OPTION_ATTRIBUTES)
           This will create a new option with the provided attributes and add it  to  the  options  instance.  A
           "trace" attribute will be automatically set for you.

       $options-&gt;include($options_instance)
           This method lets you directly include options from a second instance into the first.

       $options-&gt;include_from(@CLASSES)
           This lets you include options from multiple classes that have options defined.

       $options-&gt;include_option($opt)
           This lets you include a single already defined option instance.

       $options-&gt;pre_docs($format, @args)
           Get documentation for pre-command options. $format may be 'cli' or 'pod'.

       $options-&gt;cmd_docs($format, @args)
           Get documentation for command options. $format may be 'cli' or 'pod'.
