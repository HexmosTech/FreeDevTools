</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  routine  <u>pvm_setopt</u>  is  a  general  purpose  function  used to set miscellaneous options in the PVM
       library.  <u>What</u> is one of:

       PvmRoute
              Advises PVM on whether to set up direct task-to-task links  <u>PvmRouteDirect</u>  (using  TCP)  for  all
              subsequent  communication.  Once a link is established it persists until the application finishes.
              If a direct link can not be established because one of the two tasks has requested <u>PvmDontRoute</u> or
              because adequate resources aren't available, then the default route through  the  PVM  daemons  is
              used.   On  multiprocessors such as Intel Paragon this option is ignored because the communication
              between tasks on these  machines  always  uses  the  native  protocol  for  direct  communication.
              pvm_setopt  can  be  called multiple times to selectively establish direct links, but is typically
              set only once near the beginning of each task.  <u>PvmAllowDirect</u> is the default route setting.  This
              setting on task A allows other tasks to set  up  direct  links  to  A.   Once  a  direct  link  is
              established between tasks both tasks will use it for sending messages.

       PvmDebugMask
              When  debugging  is turned on, PVM will log detailed information about its operations and progress
              on its <u>stderr</u> stream.  <u>val</u> is the debugging level.  Default is not to print any debug information.

       PvmAutoErr
              When an error results from a libpvm function call and <u>PvmAutoErr</u> is set to  1  (the  default),  an
              error  message  is automatically printed on <u>stderr</u>.  A setting of 0 disables this.  A setting of 2
              causes the library to terminate the task by calling exit() after printing the  error  message.   A
              setting of 3 causes the library to abort after printing the error message.

       PvmOutputTid
              Sets the <u>stdout</u> destination for children tasks (spawned after the call to pvm_setopt).  Everything
              printed  on  the  standard output of tasks spawned by the calling task is packed into messages and
              sent to the destination.  <u>val</u> is the TID of a PVM  task.   Setting  PvmOutputTid  to  0  redirects
              stdout  to  the  master  pvmd, which writes to the log file /tmp/pvml.&lt;uid&gt; The default setting is
              inherited from the parent task, else is 0.

       PvmOutputCode
              Sets the message tag  for  standard  output  messages.   Should  only  be  set  when  a  task  has
              <u>PvmOutputTid</u> set to itself.

       PvmTraceTid
              Sets the trace data message destination for children tasks (spawned after the call to pvm_setopt).
              Libpvm  trace data is sent as messages to the destination.  <u>val</u> is the TID of a PVM task.  Setting
              PvmTraceTid to 0 discards trace data.  The default setting is inherited from the parent task, else
              is 0.

       PvmTraceCode
              Sets the message tag for trace data messages.  Should only be set when a task has <u>PvmTraceTid</u>  set
              to itself.

       PvmTraceBuffer
              Sets  the  trace  buffer  size for trace event collection (in bytes).  Rather than send a separate
              message for each trace event, the events are written to a message buffer until the buffer  reaches
              PvmTraceBuffer bytes.  Then a single large trace message is sent.  This can greatly reduce tracing
              intrusion.  Make sure you call pvm_exit() in your tasks to flush the trace buffer!

       PvmTraceOptions
              Sets  the PVM built-in tracing options.  This is useful for custom trace collection tools to allow
              analysis of library routine execution times and  invocation  counts.   By  default,  tracing  with
              <u>PvmTraceFull</u>  produces  full  trace  events  with  calling  arguments  and  return  values.  Using
              <u>PvmTraceTime</u> produces total time spent executing each library routine.  The  <u>PvmTraceCount</u>  option
              keep only a count of the number of times each routine was called.

       PvmFragSize
              <u>Val</u> specifies the message fragment size in bytes.  Default value varies with host architecture.

       PvmResvTids
              A <u>val</u> of 1 enables the task to send messages with reserved tags and to non-task destinations.  The
              default (0) causes libpvm to generate a <u>PvmBadParam</u> error when a reserved identifier is specified.

       PvmSelfOutputTid
              Sets  the  <u>stdout</u>  destination  for the calling task.  Everything printed on <u>stdout</u> is packed into
              messages and sent to the destination.  Note: this only works for spawned tasks, because  the  pvmd
              doesn't  get the output from tasks started by other means.  <u>val</u> is the TID of a PVM task.  Setting
              PvmSelfOutputTid to 0 redirects  stdout  to  the  master  pvmd,  which  writes  to  the  log  file
              /tmp/pvml.&lt;uid&gt;.   The  default  setting  is  inherited  from the parent task, else is 0.  Setting
              either PvmSelfOutputTid or PvmSelfOutputCode also causes both <u>PvmOutputTid</u>  and  <u>PvmOutputCode</u>  to
              take on the values of PvmSelfOutputTid and PvmSelfOutputCode, respectively.

       PvmSelfOutputCode
              Sets the message tag for standard output messages.

       PvmSelfTraceTid
              Sets  the  trace  data  message  destination  for  the calling task.  Libpvm trace data is sent as
              messages to the destination.  <u>val</u> is the TID of a PVM task.  Setting PvmSelfTraceTid to 0 discards
              trace data.  The default setting is inherited from the parent task, else  is  0.   Setting  either
              PvmSelfTraceTid  or  PvmSelfTraceCode also causes both <u>PvmTraceTid</u> and <u>PvmTraceCode</u> to take on the
              values of PvmSelfTraceTid and PvmSelfTraceCode, respectively.

       PvmSelfTraceCode
              Sets the message tag for trace data messages.

       PvmSelfTraceBuffer
              Sets the trace buffer size for trace event collection (in bytes).

       PvmSelfTraceOptions
              Sets the PVM built-in tracing options for the calling task (see PvmTraceOptions).

       PvmShowTids
              If true (nonzero), <u>pvm_catchout</u> tags each line of output printed by a child task with the task id.
              Otherwise, output is exactly as printed.

       PvmPollType
              Sets the message wait policy when using shared-memory message transport.  Setting  PvmPollType  to
              PvmPollConstant  causes  the  application  to  spin  on  its  message queue waiting for a message.
              Setting PvmPollType to PvmPollSleep causes the application to poll the message queue for  messages
              PvmPollTime times before pending on the semaphore.

       PvmPollTime
              Sets  the  poll  count  for  applications  checking  their  message  queue before they pend on the
              semaphore.  This option is ignored if PvmPollType is set to PvmPollConstant.

       PvmOutputContext
              Sets the message context for output collection messages from children.

       PvmTraceContext
              Sets the message context for trace data messages from children.

       PvmSelfOutputContext
              Sets the message context for output collection from the calling task.

       PvmSelfTraceContext
              Sets the message context for trace data messages from the calling task.

       PvmNoReset
              When set true (non-zero integer value) informs PVM  *not*  to  kill  off  the  calling  task  when
              performing a "reset" command, such as issued by the "pvm" console.

       pvm_setopt  returns the previous value of the option.  If an error occurs, the PVM error code is returned
       in place of the option value.
