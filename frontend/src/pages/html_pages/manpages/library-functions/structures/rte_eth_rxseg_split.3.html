       struct <b>rte_mempool</b> * <b>mp</b>

       <b>Warning</b>
           <b>EXPERIMENTAL:</b> this structure may change without prior notice.

       A structure used to configure an Rx packet segment to split.

       If RTE_ETH_RX_OFFLOAD_BUFFER_SPLIT flag is set in offloads field, the PMD will split the received packets
       into multiple segments according to the specification in the description array:

       • The  first network buffer will be allocated from the memory pool, specified in the first array element,
         the second buffer, from the pool in the second element, and so on.

       • The proto_hdrs in the elements define the split position of received packets.

       • The offsets from the segment description elements specify the data offset  from  the  buffer  beginning
         except the first mbuf. The first segment offset is added with RTE_PKTMBUF_HEADROOM.

       • The  lengths  in  the  elements  define  the  maximal  data  amount being received to each segment. The
         receiving starts with filling up the first mbuf data buffer up to specified length. If  the  there  are
         data  remaining  (packet  is longer than buffer in the first mbuf) the following data will be pushed to
         the next segment up to its own length, and so on.

       • If the length in the segment description element is zero the actual buffer size will  be  deduced  from
         the appropriate memory pool properties.

       • If  there  is  not  enough  elements  to  describe  the  buffer for entire packet of maximal length the
         following parameters will be used for the all remaining segments:

         • pool from the last valid element

         • the buffer size from this pool

         • zero offset

       • Length based buffer split:

         • mp, length, offset should be configured.

         • The proto_hdr field must be 0.

       • Protocol header based buffer split:

         • mp, offset, proto_hdr should be configured.

         • The length field must be 0.

         • The proto_hdr field in the last segment should be 0.

       • When protocol header split is enabled, NIC may receive packets which do  not  match  all  the  protocol
         headers  within the Rx segments. At this point, NIC will have two possible split behaviors according to
         matching results, one is exact match, another is longest match. The split result of NIC must belong  to
         one  of  them.  The exact match means NIC only do split when the packets exactly match all the protocol
         headers in the segments. Otherwise, the whole packet will be put  into  the  last  valid  mempool.  The
         longest  match  means NIC will do split until packets mismatch the protocol header in the segments. The
         rest will be put into the last valid pool.

   <b>struct</b> <b>rte_mempool*</b> <b>mp</b>
       Memory pool to allocate segment from.

       Definition at line <b>1093</b> of file <b>rte_ethdev.h</b>.

   <b>uint16_t</b> <b>length</b>
       Segment data length, configures split point.

       Definition at line <b>1094</b> of file <b>rte_ethdev.h</b>.

   <b>uint16_t</b> <b>offset</b>
       Data offset from beginning of mbuf data buffer.

       Definition at line <b>1095</b> of file <b>rte_ethdev.h</b>.

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>proto_hdr</b>
       proto_hdr defines a bit mask of the protocol sequence as RTE_PTYPE_*. The last  RTE_PTYPE*  in  the  mask
       indicates the split position.

       If  one  protocol  header  is  defined to split packets into two segments, for non-tunneling packets, the
       complete protocol sequence should be defined. For tunneling packets, for simplicity, only the tunnel  and
       inner  part  of  complete protocol sequence is required. If several protocol headers are defined to split
       packets into multi-segments, the repeated parts of adjacent segments should be omitted.
