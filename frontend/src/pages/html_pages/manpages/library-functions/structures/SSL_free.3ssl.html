       SSL_free - free an allocated SSL structure

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

        void SSL_free(SSL *ssl);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_free()</b> decrements the reference count of <b>ssl</b>, and removes the SSL structure pointed to by <b>ssl</b> and
       frees up the allocated memory if the reference count has reached 0.  If <b>ssl</b> is NULL nothing is done.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_free()</b> also calls the <b>free()</b>ing procedures for indirectly affected items, if applicable: the
       buffering BIO, the read and write BIOs, cipher lists specially created for this <b>ssl</b>, the <b>SSL_SESSION</b>.  Do
       not explicitly free these indirectly freed up items before or after calling <b>SSL_free()</b>, as trying to free
       things twice may lead to program failure.

       The ssl session has reference counts from two users: the SSL object, for which the reference count is
       removed by <b>SSL_free()</b> and the internal session cache. If the session is considered bad, because
       <b><a href="../man3/SSL_shutdown.3.html">SSL_shutdown</a></b>(3) was not called for the connection and <b><a href="../man3/SSL_set_shutdown.3.html">SSL_set_shutdown</a></b>(3) was not used to set the
       SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN state, the session will also be removed from the session cache as required by RFC2246.

       When used to free a QUIC stream SSL object, the respective sending and receiving parts of the stream are
       reset unless those parts have already been concluded normally:

       •   If  the  stream  has  a  sending  part (in other words, if it is bidirectional or a locally-initiated
           unidirectional stream) and that part has not been concluded via a call to  <b><a href="../man3/SSL_stream_conclude.3.html">SSL_stream_conclude</a></b>(3)  or
           <b><a href="../man3/SSL_stream_reset.3.html">SSL_stream_reset</a></b>(3)  on  the  QUIC  stream  SSL object, a call to <b>SSL_free()</b> automatically resets the
           sending part of the stream as though <b><a href="../man3/SSL_stream_reset.3.html">SSL_stream_reset</a></b>(3) were called with a  QUIC  application  error
           code of 0.

       •   If  the  stream  has a receiving part (in other words, if it is bidirectional or a remotely-initiated
           unidirectional stream), and the peer has not yet concluded that part of the stream normally (such  as
           via a call to <b><a href="../man3/SSL_stream_conclude.3.html">SSL_stream_conclude</a></b>(3) on its own end), a call to <b>SSL_free()</b> automatically requests the
           reset  of  the  receiving  part of the stream using a QUIC STOP_SENDING frame with a QUIC application
           error code of 0. Note that as per the QUIC protocol, this will automatically cause the peer to  reset
           that part of the stream in turn (which is its sending part).

       A  QUIC  stream  SSL object maintains a reference to a QUIC connection SSL object internally, therefore a
       QUIC stream SSL object and its parent QUIC connection SSL object can be freed in either order.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_free()</b> does not provide diagnostic information.
