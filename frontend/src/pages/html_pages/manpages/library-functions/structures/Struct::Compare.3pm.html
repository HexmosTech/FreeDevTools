</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Struct::Compare - Recursive diff for perl structures.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Struct::Compare;
           my $is_different = compare($ref1, $ref2);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Compares two values of any type and structure and returns true if they are the same. It does a deep
       comparison of the structures, so a hash of a hash of a whatever will be compared correctly.

       This is especially useful for writing unit tests for your modules!

</pre><h4><b>PUBLIC</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       •   $bool = compare($var1, $var2)

           Recursively  compares $var1 to $var2, returning false if either structure is different than the other
           at any point. If both are undefined, it returns true as well, because that is considered equal.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS/NEEDED</b> <b>ENHANCEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       •   blessed references

           compare currently does not deal with blessed references. I need to look into how to deal with this.
