</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDL::Dbg - functions to support debugging of PDL scripts

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
              use PDL;
              use PDL::Dbg;

              $c = $x-&gt;slice("5:10,2:30")-&gt;px-&gt;diagonal(3,4);
              PDL-&gt;px;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These packages implements a couple of functions that should come in handy when debugging your PDL
       scripts. They make a lot of sense while you're doing rapid prototyping of new PDL code, let's say inside
       the perldl shell.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>px</b>
       Print info about an ndarray (or all known ndarrays)

           pdl&gt; PDL-&gt;px
           pdl&gt; $y += $x-&gt;<a href="../man2/clump.2.html">clump</a>(2)-&gt;px('clumptest')-&gt;sumover
           pdl&gt; $x-&gt;px('%C (%A) Type: %T') # prints nothing unless $PDL::debug
           pdl&gt; $PDL::debug = 1
           pdl&gt;  $x-&gt;px('%C (%A) Type: %T')
           PDL (52433464) Type: Double

       This function prints some information about ndarrays. It can be invoked as a class method (e.g. "PDL-&gt;px"
       ) or as an instance method (e.g.  "$pdl-&gt;px($arg)"). If

       invoked as a class method
         it  prints  info about all ndarrays found in the current package (<u>excluding</u> "my" variables). This comes
         in quite handy when you are not quite sure which pdls you have already defined, what data they  hold  ,
         etc. "px" is supposed to support inheritance and prints info about all symbols for which an isa($class)
         is true. An optional string argument is interpreted as the package name for which to print symbols:

           pdl&gt; PDL-&gt;px('PDL::Mypack')

         The default package is that of the caller.

       invoked as an instance method
         it  prints  info  about  that particular ndarray if $PDL::debug is true and returns the pdl object upon
         completion. It accepts an optional string argument that is simply prepended to the default info  if  it
         doesn't  contain a "%" character. If, however, the argument contains a "%" then the string is passed to
         the "info" method to control the format of the  printed  information.  This  can  be  used  to  achieve
         customized output from "px". See the documentation of "PDL::info" for further details.

       The  output of px will be determined by the default formatting string that is passed to the "info" method
       (unless you pass a string containing "%" to px when invoking as an  instance  method,  see  above).  This
       default  string  is stored in $PDL::Dbg::Infostr and the default output format can be accordingly changed
       by setting this variable.  If you do this you should also change the default title string that the  class
       method  branch  prints  at  the  top of the listing to match your new format string. The default title is
       stored in the variable $PDL::Dbg::Title.

       For historical reasons "vars" is an alias for "px".

   <b>vars</b>
       Alias for "px"
