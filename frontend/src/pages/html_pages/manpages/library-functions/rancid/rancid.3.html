       rancid - rancid Perl and Python modules

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>rancid</b> library provides functions for handling rancid.types configuration files, loading modules, and
       the basic global variables, variables from parsing rancid.types files, and output handling functions that
       are  common to all rancid device modules, all of which are exported (in Perl terms) for use by those that
       import the module.  Specifically, the library is used by <b><a href="../man1/rancid.1.html">rancid</a></b>(1), but it could  be  used  by  any  Perl
       program for site-specific handling or additional automata.

       Input  handling functions: The <b>rancidcontrib</b> library contains functions for similar purposes, but are not
       part of the base rancid.  Please see the text of the module itself for its documentation.

       <b>RunCommand(*INPUT,</b> <b>*OUTPUT,</b> <b>command)</b>
              Parse a single command that returns no required info; the output is dropped.  This could  be  used
              as the processing function in a command definition in a rancid.types file.

       Output handling functions:

       <b>ProcessHistory([tag],</b> <b>[sort_function],</b> <b>[sort_function_argument],</b> <b>string)</b>
              If  the  optional  tag  string  and  sort_function  arguments  are  omitted,  the string is output
              immediately.   Otherwise,  the  strings  are  accumulated   in   a   hash,   by   the   hash   key
              sort_function_argument,  each  time  <b>ProcessHistory()</b>  is  called  until  the tag or sort_function
              changes, at which time the queue is flushed and the new string is handled.  If  sort_function  had
              been supplied, it is called with the hash as its argument.

              Note  that  if  the  hash  key  sort_function_argument  exists, the new strings is appended to the
              existing hash value.

       <b>keysort(%hash)</b>
              A sort routine that will sort on the keys of a hash as if it were a normal array.  For example:

              ProcessHistory("TAG","keysort","B0","!\n");
              ProcessHistory("TAG","keysort","D0","!\n");

              B0 and D0 are the sort keys.

       <b>valsort(%hash)</b>
              A sort routine that will sort on the values of a hash as if it were a normal array.

              ProcessHistory("TAG","valsort","","!B0\n");
              ProcessHistory("TAG","valsort","","!D0\n");

       <b>numsort(%hash)</b>
              A numerical sort routine (ascending).

       <b>ipsort(IPv4</b> <b>dotted-quad/v6</b> <b>address)</b>
              A sort routine that will sort on the ip address when the IP address is anywhere in the strings.

              ProcessHistory("TAG","ipsort","192.168.0.0","!B0\n");
              ProcessHistory("TAG","ipsort","192.168.1.0","!D0\n");

       <b>sortbyipaddr(XXX)</b>
              A sort routine that will sort based upon IPv4/v6 addresses.

       Please see the library code for exported variables.

       Please see the <b><a href="../man1/pydoc.1.html">pydoc</a></b>(1) for documentation on the <b>rancid</b> Python module.  It  is  equivalent  to  the  Perl
       module, but in a Pythonic manner.
