       xcb_grab_key - Grab keyboard key(s)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</b>

   <b>Request</b> <b>function</b>

       xcb_void_cookie_t <b>xcb_grab_key</b>(xcb_connection_t *<u>conn</u>, uint8_t <u>owner_events</u>, xcb_window_t <u>grab_window</u>,
              uint16_t <u>modifiers</u>, xcb_keycode_t <u>key</u>, uint8_t <u>pointer_mode</u>, uint8_t <u>keyboard_mode</u>);

</pre><h4><b>REQUEST</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>conn</u>      The XCB connection to X11.

       <u>owner_events</u>
                 If  1,  the  <u>grab_window</u>  will  still  get the key events. If 0, events are not reported to the
                 <u>grab_window</u>.

       <u>grab_window</u>
                 Specifies the window on which the key should be grabbed.

       <u>modifiers</u> The modifiers to grab.

                 Using the special value <u>XCB_MOD_MASK_ANY</u> means grab the key with all possible modifier combina‐
                 tions.

       <u>key</u>       The keycode of the key to grab.

                 The special value <u>XCB_GRAB_ANY</u> means grab any key.

       <u>pointer_mode</u>
                 One of the following values:

                 <u>XCB_GRAB_MODE_SYNC</u>
                           The state of the keyboard appears to freeze: No further keyboard events are generated
                           by the server until the grabbing client issues a releasing <u>AllowEvents</u> request or un‐
                           til the keyboard grab is released.

                 <u>XCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC</u>
                           Keyboard event processing continues normally.

       <u>keyboard_mode</u>
                 One of the following values:

                 <u>XCB_GRAB_MODE_SYNC</u>
                           The state of the keyboard appears to freeze: No further keyboard events are generated
                           by the server until the grabbing client issues a releasing <u>AllowEvents</u> request or un‐
                           til the keyboard grab is released.

                 <u>XCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC</u>
                           Keyboard event processing continues normally.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Establishes a passive grab on the keyboard. In the future, the  keyboard  is  actively  grabbed  (as  for
       <u>GrabKeyboard</u>),  the last-keyboard-grab time is set to the time at which the key was pressed (as transmit‐
       ted in the KeyPress event), and the KeyPress event is reported if all of  the  following  conditions  are
       true:

       The  keyboard  is  not  grabbed  and  the specified key (which can itself be a modifier key) is logically
       pressed when the specified modifier keys are logically down, and no other  modifier  keys  are  logically
       down.

       Either  the grab_window is an ancestor of (or is) the focus window, or the grab_window is a descendant of
       the focus window and contains the pointer.

       A passive grab on the same key combination does not exist on any ancestor of grab_window.

       The interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for XGrabKeyboard.  The active grab is terminated au‐
       tomatically when the logical state of the keyboard has the specified key  released  (independent  of  the
       logical  state  of the modifier keys), at which point a KeyRelease event is reported to the grabbing win‐
       dow.

       Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by client applications) may lag the  physical  state  if
       device event processing is frozen.

       A modifiers argument of AnyModifier is equivalent to issuing the request for all possible modifier combi‐
       nations  (including  the  combination  of no modifiers).  It is not required that all modifiers specified
       have currently assigned KeyCodes.  A keycode argument of AnyKey is equivalent to issuing the request  for
       all  possible  KeyCodes.   Otherwise, the specified keycode must be in the range specified by min_keycode
       and max_keycode in the connection setup, or a BadValue error results.

       If some other client has issued a XGrabKey with the same key combination on the same window, a  BadAccess
       error results.  When using AnyModifier or AnyKey, the request fails completely, and a BadAccess error re‐
       sults (no grabs are established) if there is a conflicting grab for any combination.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns an <u>xcb_void_cookie_t</u>. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If  you want to handle errors directly with <u>xcb_request_check</u> instead, use <u>xcb_grab_key_checked</u>. See <b><a href="../man3/xcbrequests.3.html">xcb-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man3/xcbrequests.3.html">requests</a>(3)</b> for details.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xcb_access_error_t</u>
                 Another client has already issued a GrabKey with the same button/key combination  on  the  same
                 window.

       <u>xcb_value_error_t</u>
                 The  key  is  not <u>XCB_GRAB_ANY</u> and not in the range specified by <u>min_keycode</u> and <u>max_keycode</u> in
                 the connection setup.

       <u>xcb_window_error_t</u>
                 The specified <u>window</u> does not exist.
