</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XGrabKeyboard, XUngrabKeyboard - grab the keyboard

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>

       int  XGrabKeyboard(Display  *<u>display</u>,  Window  <u>grab_window</u>,  Bool  <u>owner_events</u>,  int  <u>pointer_mode</u>,  int
              <u>keyboard_mode</u>, Time <u>time</u>);

       int XUngrabKeyboard(Display *<u>display</u>, Time <u>time</u>);

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>display</u>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <u>grab_window</u>
                 Specifies the grab window.

       <u>keyboard_mode</u>
                 Specifies further processing of keyboard events.  You can pass <b>GrabModeSync</b> or <b>GrabModeAsync</b>.

       <u>owner_events</u>
                 Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether the keyboard events  are  to  be  reported  as
                 usual.

       <u>pointer_mode</u>
                 Specifies further processing of pointer events.  You can pass <b>GrabModeSync</b> or <b>GrabModeAsync</b>.

       <u>time</u>      Specifies the time.  You can pass either a timestamp or <b>CurrentTime</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>XGrabKeyboard</b>  function  actively  grabs  control of the keyboard and generates <b>FocusIn</b> and <b>FocusOut</b>
       events.  Further key events are reported only to the grabbing client.  <b>XGrabKeyboard</b> overrides any active
       keyboard grab by this client.  If owner_events is <b>False</b>, all  generated  key  events  are  reported  with
       respect  to grab_window.  If owner_events is <b>True</b> and if a generated key event would normally be reported
       to this client, it  is  reported  normally;  otherwise,  the  event  is  reported  with  respect  to  the
       grab_window.  Both <b>KeyPress</b> and <b>KeyRelease</b> events are always reported, independent of any event selection
       made by the client.

       If  the  keyboard_mode  argument  is <b>GrabModeAsync</b>, keyboard event processing continues as usual.  If the
       keyboard is currently frozen by this client, then processing of  keyboard  events  is  resumed.   If  the
       keyboard_mode   argument  is  <b>GrabModeSync</b>,  the  state  of the keyboard (as seen by client applications)
       appears to freeze, and the X server generates no further keyboard events until the grabbing client issues
       a releasing <b>XAllowEvents</b> call or until the keyboard grab is released.  Actual keyboard  changes  are  not
       lost while the keyboard is frozen; they are simply queued in the server for later processing.

       If  pointer_mode  is <b>GrabModeAsync</b>, pointer event processing is unaffected by activation of the grab.  If
       pointer_mode is <b>GrabModeSync</b>, the state of the pointer  (as  seen  by  client  applications)  appears  to
       freeze, and the X server generates no further pointer events until the grabbing client issues a releasing
       <b>XAllowEvents</b>  call or until the keyboard grab is released.  Actual pointer changes are not lost while the
       pointer is frozen; they are simply queued in the server for later processing.

       If the keyboard is actively grabbed by some other client, <b>XGrabKeyboard</b> fails and returns <b>AlreadyGrabbed</b>.
       If grab_window is not viewable, it fails and returns <b>GrabNotViewable</b>.  If the keyboard is  frozen  by  an
       active  grab  of  another client, it fails and returns <b>GrabFrozen</b>.  If the specified time is earlier than
       the  last-keyboard-grab  time  or  later  than  the  current  X  server  time,  it  fails   and   returns
       <b>GrabInvalidTime</b>.   Otherwise,  the  last-keyboard-grab  time is set to the specified time (<b>CurrentTime</b> is
       replaced by the current X server time).

       <b>XGrabKeyboard</b> can generate <b>BadValue</b> and <b>BadWindow</b> errors.

       The <b>XUngrabKeyboard</b> function releases the keyboard and any queued events if this client has  it  actively
       grabbed  from  either  <b>XGrabKeyboard</b>  or <b>XGrabKey</b>.  <b>XUngrabKeyboard</b> does not release the keyboard and any
       queued events if the specified time is earlier than the last-keyboard-grab time  or  is  later  than  the
       current  X  server  time.   It  also  generates  <b>FocusIn</b> and <b>FocusOut</b> events.  The X server automatically
       performs an <b>UngrabKeyboard</b> request if the event window for an active keyboard grab becomes not viewable.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BadValue</b>  Some numeric value falls outside the range  of  values  accepted  by  the  request.   Unless  a
                 specific  range  is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

       <b>BadWindow</b> A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
