       XkbGetNamedGeometry - Loads a keyboard geometry description from this database by name

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>Status</b> <b>XkbGetNamedGeometry</b> <b>(Display</b> <b>*</b><u>dpy</u><b>,</b> <b>XkbDescPtr</b> <u>xkb</u><b>,</b> <b>Atom</b> <u>name</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>dpy</u>    connection to the X server

       <u>xkb</u>    keyboard description into which the geometry should be loaded

       <u>name</u>   name of the geometry to be loaded

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       It  is  also  possible to load a keyboard geometry by name. The X server maintains a database of keyboard
       components (see below).

       <u>XkbGetNamedGeometry</u> can return BadName if the name cannot be found.

       The X server maintains a database of keyboard components, identified by  component  type.   The  database
       contains  all the information necessary to build a complete keyboard description for a particular device,
       as well as to assemble partial descriptions. Table 1 identifies the  component  types  and  the  type  of
       information they contain.

       While a keymap is a database entry for a complete keyboard description, and therefore logically different
       from the individual component database entries, the rules for processing keymap entries are identical  to
       those for the individual components.  In the discussion that follows, the term component is used to refer
       to either individual components or a keymap.

       There  may  be  multiple  entries  for  each  of  the component types. An entry may be either <u>complete</u> or
       <u>partial.</u>  Partial entries describe only a piece of the corresponding keyboard component and are  designed
       to be combined with other entries of the same type to form a complete entry.

       For  example,  a  partial  symbols map might describe the differences between a common ASCII keyboard and
       some national layout. Such a partial map is not useful on its own  because  it  does  not  include  those
       symbols  that  are  the same on both the ASCII and national layouts (such as function keys). On the other
       hand, this partial map can be used to configure <u>any</u> ASCII keyboard to use a national layout.

       When a keyboard description is built, the components are processed in the order in which they  appear  in
       Table 1; later definitions override earlier ones.
