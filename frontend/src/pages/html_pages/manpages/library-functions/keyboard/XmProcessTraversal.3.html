</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XmProcessTraversal</b>  —  A  function that determines which component receives keyboard events when a widget
       has the focus "XmProcessTraversal"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt;
       <b>Boolean</b> <b>XmProcessTraversal</b>(
       <b>Widget</b> <b>widget</b>,
       <b>XmTraversalDirection</b> <b>direction</b>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XmProcessTraversal</b> determines which component of a hierarchy receives keyboard events when the  hierarchy
       that contains the given widget has keyboard focus.

       <b>XmProcessTraversal</b> changes focus only when the keyboard focus policy of the widget hierarchy is explicit.
       If  the  <b>XmNkeyboardFocusPolicy</b>  of  the  nearest  shell  ancestor of the given widget is not <b>XmEXPLICIT</b>,
       <b>XmProcessTraversal</b> returns False without making any focus changes.

       <u>widget</u>    Specifies the widget ID of the widget whose hierarchy is to be traversed

       <u>direction</u> Specifies the direction of traversal

   <b>DEFINITIONS</b>
       In order to be eligible to receive keyboard focus when the shell's <b>XmNkeyboardFocusPolicy</b> is  <b>XmEXPLICIT</b>,
       a widget or gadget must meet the following conditions:

          •  The widget and its ancestors are not in the process of being destroyed.

          •  The  widget  and  its  ancestors  are  <u>sensitive</u>.   A widget is sensitive when its <b>XmNsensitive</b> and
             <b>XmNancestorSensitive</b> resources are both True.

          •  The <b>XmNtraversalOn</b> resource for the widget and its ancestors is True.

          •  The widget is viewable.  This means that the widget and its ancestors are  managed,  realized,  and
             (except  for  gadgets) mapped.  Furthermore, in general, some part of the widget's rectangular area
             must be unobscured by the widget's ancestors. If an  application  unmaps  a  widget  that  has  its
             <b>XmNmappedWhenManaged</b> resource set to True, the result is undefined.

                 In  a  ScrolledWindow  with  an  <b>XmNscrollingPolicy</b>  of  <b>XmAUTOMATIC</b>, a widget that is obscured
                 because it is not within the clip window may be able to receive  focus  if  some  part  of  the
                 widget  is  within  the  work  area  and if an <b>XmNtraverseObscuredCallback</b> routine can make the
                 widget at least partially visible by scrolling the window.

       In general only primitives, gadgets, and Drawing Area are  eligible  to  receive  focus.   Most  managers
       cannot receive focus even if they meet all these conditions.

       The  <u>direction</u>  argument  identifies  the  kind  of  traversal action to take.  The descriptions of these
       actions below refer to traversable non-tab-group widgets and traversable tab groups.

          •  A traversable non-tab-group widget is a widget that is not a tab  group  and  that  meets  all  the
             conditions for receiving focus described above.

          •  A  traversable tab group widget is a tab group widget that meets the same conditions, except that a
             manager that is a tab group and meets the other conditions is also eligible for traversal  as  long
             as it contains a descendant that can receive focus.

       A tab group is a widget whose <b>XmNnavigationType</b> is:

          •  <b>XmTAB_GROUP</b>  or  <b>XmSTICKY_TAB_GROUP</b>,  if  the  hierarchy  (up  to  the nearest shell ancestor) that
             contains the widget has no widget whose <b>XmNnavigationType</b> is <b>XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</b>

          •  <b>XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</b> or <b>XmSTICKY_TAB_GROUP</b>, if the hierarchy (up to the  nearest  shell  ancestor)
             that contains the widget has any widget whose <b>XmNnavigationType</b> is <b>XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</b>

   <b>TRAVERSAL</b> <b>ACTIONS</b>
       The  hierarchy  to be traversed is that containing the <u>widget</u> argument.  This hierarchy is traversed only
       up to the nearest shell; <b>XmProcessTraversal</b> does not move focus from one shell to another.  If the  shell
       containing  <u>widget</u>  does  not  currently  have the focus, any change that <b>XmProcessTraversal</b> makes to the
       element with focus within that shell does not take effect until the next time the shell receives focus.

       <b>XmProcessTraversal</b> begins the traversal action from the  widget  in  the  hierarchy  that  currently  has
       keyboard focus or that last had focus when the user traversed away from the shell hierarchy.

       The value of the <u>direction</u> argument determines which of three kinds of traversal action to take:

          •  Traversal  to a non-tab-group widget.  This kind of traversal is possible only when the widget that
             currently has focus is not a tab group;  otherwise,  <b>XmProcessTraversal</b>  returns  False  for  these
             actions.

                 These actions do not move focus from one tab group to another.  The actions first determine the
                 containing  tab  group.   This is the tab group containing the widget that currently has focus.
                 The actions traverse only to a non-tab-group widget within the containing tab group.

                 A non-tab-group widget is eligible for this kind of traversal if the widget is traversable  and
                 has  no  tab  group  ancestors  up  to  the containing tab group.  If the tab group contains no
                 traversable non-tab-group widgets, <b>XmProcessTraversal</b> returns False.

                 Following are the possible values of the <u>direction</u> argument.   Note  that  when  actions  wrap,
                 wrapping  occurs  in the traversal direction. The following describes what happens in a left to
                 right environment:

                    •  <b>XmTRAVERSE_RIGHT</b>—If  the  <b>XmNnavigationType</b>  of  the  containing   tab   group   is   not
                       <b>XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</b>,  focus  moves  to the next traversable non-tab-group widget to the
                       right of the widget that currently has focus.  In a left to  right  environment,  at  the
                       right  side  of  the  tab group this action wraps to the non-tab-group widget at the left
                       side and next toward the bottom.  At the rightmost widget in the bottom row  of  the  tab
                       group  this  action wraps to the non-tab-group widget at the leftmost widget in the upper
                       row.

                           In a right to left environment, at the right side of the tab group, this action wraps
                           to the non-tab-group widget at the  left  side  and  next  toward  the  top.  At  the
                           rightmost  widget in the upper row of the tab group this action wraps to the non-tab-
                           group widget at the leftmost widget in the bottom row.

                           If the <b>XmNnavigationType</b> of the containing tab group is <b>XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</b>,  focus
                           moves  to  the  next traversable non-tab-group widget in the tab group, proceeding in
                           the order in which the widgets appear in their parents' <b>XmNchildren</b> lists.  After the
                           last widget in the tab group, this action wraps to the first non-tab-group widget.

                    •  <b>XmTRAVERSE_LEFT</b>—If  the  <b>XmNnavigationType</b>  of  the   containing   tab   group   is   not
                       <b>XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</b>,  focus  moves  to the next traversable non-tab-group widget to the
                       left of the widget that currently has focus.  In a left to right environment, at the left
                       side of the tab group this action wraps to the non-tab-group widget at the right side and
                       next toward the top.  At the leftmost widget in the upper  row  of  the  tab  group  this
                       action wraps to the non-tab-group widget at the rightmost widget in the bottom row.

                           In  a  right to left environment, at the left side of the tab group this action wraps
                           to the non-tab-group widget at the right side and next  toward  the  bottom.  At  the
                           leftmost  widget in the bottom row of the tab group this action wraps to the non-tab-
                           group widget at the rightmost widget in the upper row.

                           If the <b>XmNnavigationType</b> of the containing tab group is <b>XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</b>,  focus
                           moves  to  the previous traversable non-tab-group widget in the tab group, proceeding
                           in the reverse order in which the widgets appear in their parents' <b>XmNchildren</b> lists.
                           After the first widget in the tab group, this action wraps to the last  non-tab-group
                           widget.

                    •  <b>XmTRAVERSE_DOWN</b>—If   the   <b>XmNnavigationType</b>   of   the   containing  tab  group  is  not
                       <b>XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</b>, focus moves to the next traversable non-tab-group widget below the
                       widget that currently has focus.  In a left to right environment, at the  bottom  of  the
                       tab  group  this  action wraps to the non-tab-group widget at the top and next toward the
                       right.  At the bottom widget in the rightmost column of the tab group this  action  wraps
                       to the non-tab-group widget at the top widget in the leftmost column.

                           In  a  right to left environment, at the bottom of the tab group this action wraps to
                           the non-tab-group widget at the top and next toward the left. At the bottom widget of
                           the leftmost widget of the tab group this action wraps to the non-tab-group widget at
                           the top widget of the rightmost column.

                           If the <b>XmNnavigationType</b> of the containing tab group is <b>XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</b>,  focus
                           moves  to  the  next traversable non-tab-group widget in the tab group, proceeding in
                           the order in which the widgets appear in their parents' <b>XmNchildren</b> lists.  After the
                           last widget in the tab group, this action wraps to the first non-tab-group widget.

                    •  <b>XmTRAVERSE_UP</b>—If  the  <b>XmNnavigationType</b>   of   the   containing   tab   group   is   not
                       <b>XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</b>, focus moves to the next traversable non-tab-group widget above the
                       widget  that  currently has focus.  In a left to right environment, at the top of the tab
                       group this action wraps to the non-tab-group widget at the bottom  and  next  toward  the
                       left.  At the top widget of the leftmost column of the tab group this action wraps to the
                       non-tab-group widget at the bottom widget of the rightmost column.

                           In  a right to left environment, at the top of the tab group this action wraps to the
                           non-tab-group widget at the bottom and next toward the right. At the  top  widget  of
                           the  right most column of the tab group this action wraps to the non-tab-group widget
                           at the bottom widget of the leftmost column.

                           If the <b>XmNnavigationType</b> of the containing tab group is <b>XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</b>,  focus
                           moves  to  the previous traversable non-tab-group widget in the tab group, proceeding
                           in the reverse order in which the widgets appear in their parents' <b>XmNchildren</b> lists.
                           After the first widget in the tab group, this action wraps to the last  non-tab-group
                           widget.

                    •  <b>XmTRAVERSE_NEXT</b>—Focus  moves  to  the  next  traversable  non-tab-group widget in the tab
                       group, proceeding in the order in which the widgets appear in their parents'  <b>XmNchildren</b>
                       lists.   After  the last widget in the tab group, this action wraps to the first non-tab-
                       group widget.

                    •  <b>XmTRAVERSE_PREV</b>—Focus moves to the previous traversable non-tab-group widget in  the  tab
                       group,  proceeding  in  the  reverse  order in which the widgets appear in their parents'
                       <b>XmNchildren</b> lists.  After the first widget in the tab group, this  action  wraps  to  the
                       last non-tab-group widget.

                    •  <b>XmTRAVERSE_HOME</b>—If   the   <b>XmNnavigationType</b>   of   the   containing  tab  group  is  not
                       <b>XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</b>, focus moves to the first traversable non-tab-group widget  at  the
                       initial focus of the tab group.

                           If  the <b>XmNnavigationType</b> of the containing tab group is <b>XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</b>, focus
                           moves to the first traversable non-tab-group widget in the tab  group,  according  to
                           the order in which the widgets appear in their parents' <b>XmNchildren</b> lists.

          •  Traversal  to  a  tab  group.   These  actions first determine the current widget hierarchy and the
             containing tab group.  The current widget hierarchy is the  widget  hierarchy  whose  root  is  the
             nearest  shell ancestor of the widget that currently has focus.  The containing tab group is is the
             tab group containing the widget that currently has focus.  If the current widget hierarchy contains
             no traversable tab groups, <b>XmProcessTraversal</b> returns False.

                 Following are the possible values of the <u>direction</u> argument. If any tab group  in  the  current
                 widget  hierarchy has an <b>XmNnavigationType</b> of <b>XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</b>, traversal of tab groups in
                 the hierarchy proceeds to widgets in the order in which their <b>XmNnavigationType</b> resources  were
                 specified as <b>XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</b> or <b>XmSTICKY_TAB_GROUP</b>.:

                    •  <b>XmTRAVERSE_NEXT_TAB_GROUP</b>—Finds  the hierarchy that contains <u>widget</u>, finds the active tab
                       group (if any), and makes the next tab group the active tab group in the hierarchy.

                    •  <b>XmTRAVERSE_PREV_TAB_GROUP</b>—Finds the hierarchy that contains <u>widget</u>, finds the active  tab
                       group (if any), and makes the previous tab group the active tab group in the hierarchy.

          •  Traversal   to   any   widget.    In  this  case  the  <u>widget</u>  argument  is  the  widget  to  which
             <b>XmProcessTraversal</b> tries to give focus.  If  the  widget  is  not  traversable,  <b>XmProcessTraversal</b>
             returns False.

                 Following are the possible values of the <u>direction</u> argument:

                    •  <b>XmTRAVERSE_CURRENT</b>—Finds  the  hierarchy  and the tab group that contain <u>widget</u>.  If this
                       tab group is not the active tab group, this action makes it the  active  tab  group.   If
                       <u>widget</u>  is  an  item  in  the active tab group, this action makes it the active item.  If
                       <u>widget</u> is the active tab group, this action makes the first traversable item in  the  tab
                       group the active item.

   <b>CAUTIONS</b>
       Using  <b>XmProcessTraversal</b>  to  traverse  to  MenuBars,  Pulldown  menu  panes, or Popup menu panes is not
       supported.

       <b>XmProcessTraversal</b> cannot be called recursively.  In particular, an application cannot call this  routine
       from an <b>XmNfocusCallback</b> or <b>XmNlosingFocusCallback</b> procedure.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b></h4><pre>
       Returns  True  if  the  traversal  action  succeeded.  Returns False if the <b>XmNkeyboardFocusPolicy</b> of the
       nearest shell ancestor of <u>widget</u> is not <b>XmEXPLICIT</b>, if the traversal action finds no  traversable  widget
       to receive focus, or if the call to the routine has invalid arguments.
