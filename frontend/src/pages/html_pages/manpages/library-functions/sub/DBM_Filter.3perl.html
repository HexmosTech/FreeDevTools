</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides an interface that allows filters to be applied to tied Hashes associated with DBM
       files. It builds on the DBM Filter hooks that are present in all the *DB*_File modules included with the
       standard Perl source distribution from version 5.6.1 onwards. In addition to the *DB*_File modules
       distributed with Perl, the BerkeleyDB module, available on CPAN, supports the DBM Filter hooks. See
       perldbmfilter for more details on the DBM Filter hooks.

</pre><h4><b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>DBM</b> <b>Filter?</b></h4><pre>
       A DBM Filter allows the keys and/or values in a tied hash to be modified by some user-defined code just
       before it is written to the DBM file and just after it is read back from the DBM file. For example, this
       snippet of code

           $some_hash{"abc"} = 42;

       could potentially trigger two filters, one for the writing of the key "abc" and another for writing the
       value 42.  Similarly, this snippet

           my ($key, $value) = each %some_hash

       will trigger two filters, one for the reading of the key and one for the reading of the value.

       Like the existing DBM Filter functionality, this module arranges for the $_ variable to be populated with
       the key or value that a filter will check. This usually means that most DBM filters tend to be very
       short.

   <b>So</b> <b>what's</b> <b>new?</b>
       The main enhancements over the standard DBM Filter hooks are:

       •   A cleaner interface.

       •   The ability to easily apply multiple filters to a single DBM file.

       •   The  ability  to  create  "canned"  filters.  These allow commonly used filters to be packaged into a
           stand-alone module.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This module will arrange for the following methods to be available via the object returned from the "tie"
       call.

   <b>$db-&gt;Filter_Push()</b> <b>/</b> <b>$db-&gt;Filter_Key_Push()</b> <b>/</b> <b>$db-&gt;Filter_Value_Push()</b>
       Add a filter to filter stack for the database, $db. The three formats vary only in whether they apply  to
       the DBM key, the DBM value or both.

       Filter_Push
            The filter is applied to <u>both</u> keys and values.

       Filter_Key_Push
            The filter is applied to the key <u>only</u>.

       Filter_Value_Push
            The filter is applied to the value <u>only</u>.

   <b>$db-&gt;Filter_Pop()</b>
       Removes the last filter that was applied to the DBM file associated with $db, if present.

   <b>$db-&gt;Filtered()</b>
       Returns TRUE if there are any filters applied to the DBM associated with $db.  Otherwise returns FALSE.

</pre><h4><b>Writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>Filter</b></h4><pre>
       Filters can be created in two main ways

   <b>Immediate</b> <b>Filters</b>
       An  immediate  filter  allows  you to specify the filter code to be used at the point where the filter is
       applied to a dbm. In this mode the Filter_*_Push methods expects to receive exactly two parameters.

           my $db = tie %hash, 'SDBM_File', ...
           $db-&gt;Filter_Push( Store =&gt; sub { },
                             Fetch =&gt; sub { });

       The code reference associated with "Store" will be called before any key/value is written to the database
       and the code reference associated with "Fetch" will be called  after  any  key/value  is  read  from  the
       database.

       For  example,  here is a sample filter that adds a trailing NULL character to all strings before they are
       written to the DBM file, and removes the trailing NULL when they are read from the DBM file

           my $db = tie %hash, 'SDBM_File', ...
           $db-&gt;Filter_Push( Store =&gt; sub { $_ .= "\x00" ; },
                             Fetch =&gt; sub { s/\x00$// ;    });

       Points to note:

       1.   Both the Store and Fetch filters manipulate $_.

   <b>Canned</b> <b>Filters</b>
       Immediate filters are useful for one-off situations. For more  generic  problems  it  can  be  useful  to
       package the filter up in its own module.

       The usage is for a canned filter is:

           $db-&gt;Filter_Push("name", params)

       where

       "name"
            is  the  name  of the module to load. If the string specified does not contain the package separator
            characters "::", it is assumed to refer to the full module name "DBM_Filter::name". This means  that
            the full names for canned filters, "null" and "utf8", included with this module are:

                DBM_Filter::null
                DBM_Filter::utf8

       params
            any  optional parameters that need to be sent to the filter. See the encode filter for an example of
            a module that uses parameters.

       The module that implements the canned filter can take one of two forms. Here is a template for the first

           package DBM_Filter::null ;

           use strict;
           use warnings;

           sub Store
           {
               # store code here
           }

           sub Fetch
           {
               # fetch code here
           }

           1;

       Notes:

       1.   The package name uses the "DBM_Filter::" prefix.

       2.   The module <u>must</u> have both a Store and a Fetch method.  If  only  one  is  present,  or  neither  are
            present, a fatal error will be thrown.

       The second form allows the filter to hold state information using a closure, thus:

           package DBM_Filter::encoding ;

           use strict;
           use warnings;

           sub Filter
           {
               my @params = @_ ;

               ...
               return {
                   Store   =&gt; sub { $_ = $encoding-&gt;encode($_) },
                   Fetch   =&gt; sub { $_ = $encoding-&gt;decode($_) }
                   } ;
           }

           1;

       In this instance the "Store" and "Fetch" methods are encapsulated inside a "Filter" method.

</pre><h4><b>Filters</b> <b>Included</b></h4><pre>
       A  number  of  canned  filers  are  provided with this module. They cover a number of the main areas that
       filters are needed when interfacing with DBM files. They also act as templates for your own filters.

       The filter included are:

       •    utf8

            This module will ensure that all data written to the DBM will be encoded in UTF-8.

            This module needs the Encode module.

       •    encode

            Allows you to choose the character encoding will be store in the DBM file.

       •    compress

            This filter will compress all data before it is written to  the  database  and  uncompressed  it  on
            reading.

            This module needs Compress::Zlib.

       •    int32

            This module is used when interoperating with a C/C++ application that uses a C int as either the key
            and/or value in the DBM file.

       •    null

            This  module  ensures  that all data written to the DBM file is null terminated. This is useful when
            you have a perl script that needs to interoperate with a DBM file that a  C  program  also  uses.  A
            fairly  common  issue  is  for the C application to include the terminating null in a string when it
            writes to the DBM file. This filter will ensure that all data written to the DBM file can be read by
            the C application.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Maintain</b> <b>Round</b> <b>Trip</b> <b>Integrity</b>
       When writing a DBM filter it is <u>very</u> important to ensure that it is possible to retrieve  all  data  that
       you have written when the DBM filter is in place. In practice, this means that whatever transformation is
       applied  to  the  data  in  the  Store method, the <u>exact</u> inverse operation should be applied in the Fetch
       method.

       If you don't provide an exact inverse transformation, you will find that code like this will  not  behave
       as you expect.

            while (my ($k, $v) = each %hash)
            {
                ...
            }

       Depending on the transformation, you will find that one or more of the following will happen

       1.   The loop will never terminate.

       2.   Too few records will be retrieved.

       3.   Too many will be retrieved.

       4.   The loop will do the right thing for a while, but it will unexpectedly fail.

   <b>Don't</b> <b>mix</b> <b>filtered</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>non-filtered</b> <b>data</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>database</b> <b>file.</b>
       This  is  just a restatement of the previous section. Unless you are completely certain you know what you
       are doing, avoid mixing filtered &amp; non-filtered data.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Say you need to interoperate with a legacy C application that stores keys as C ints and  the  values  and
       null terminated UTF-8 strings. Here is how you would set that up

           my $db = tie %hash, 'SDBM_File', ...

           $db-&gt;Filter_Key_Push('int32') ;

           $db-&gt;Filter_Value_Push('utf8');
           $db-&gt;Filter_Value_Push('null');
