</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDPOSV - compute the solution to a real system of linear equations   sub( A ) * X = sub( B ),

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       SUBROUTINE PDPOSV( UPLO, N, NRHS, A, IA, JA, DESCA, B, IB, JB, DESCB, INFO )

           CHARACTER      UPLO

           INTEGER        IA, IB, INFO, JA, JB, N, NRHS

           INTEGER        DESCA( * ), DESCB( * )

           DOUBLE         PRECISION A( * ), B( * )

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       PDPOSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations

       where  sub(  A  ) denotes A(IA:IA+N-1,JA:JA+N-1) and is an N-by-N symmetric distributed positive definite
       matrix and X and sub( B ) denoting B(IB:IB+N-1,JB:JB+NRHS-1) are N-by-NRHS distributed matrices.

       The Cholesky decomposition is used to factor sub( A ) as

                          sub( A ) = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or

                          sub( A ) = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',

       where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular matrix.  The factored form of sub( A  )
       is then used to solve the system of equations.

       Notes
       =====

       Each  global  data  object  is  described  by  an  associated description vector.  This vector stores the
       information required to establish the mapping between an object element and its corresponding process and
       memory location.

       Let A be a generic term for any 2D block  cyclicly  distributed  array.   Such  a  global  array  has  an
       associated  description  vector  DESCA.  In the following comments, the character _ should be read as "of
       the global array".

       NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
       --------------- -------------- -------------------------------------- DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_  )The
       descriptor type.  In this case,
                                      DTYPE_A = 1.
       CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
                                      the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
                                      ted over. The context itself is glo-
                                      bal, but the handle (the integer
                                      value) may vary.
       M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
                                      array A.
       N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
                                      array A.
       MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the rows of the array.
       NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the columns of the array.
       RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
                                      row  of  the  array  A is distributed.  CSRC_A (global) DESCA( CSRC_ ) The
       process column over which the
                                      first column of the array A is
                                      distributed.
       LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
                                      array.  LLD_A &gt;= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).

       Let K be the number of rows or columns of a distributed matrix, and assume  that  its  process  grid  has
       dimension p x q.
       LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the
       p processes of its process column.
       Similarly,  LOCc(  K  )  denotes  the  number  of  elements  of  K that a process would receive if K were
       distributed over the q processes of its process row.
       The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
               LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
               LOCc( N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).  An upper bound for these quantities may  be
       computed by:
               LOCr( M ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
               LOCc( N ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A

       This routine requires square block decomposition ( MB_A = NB_A ).

               by-N  lower  triangular  part of sub( A ) contains the lower triangular part of the distribu- ted
               matrix, and its strictly upper triangular part is not referenced. On exit,  if  INFO  =  0,  this

               = 0:  successful exit
               &lt;  0:   If  the  i-th  argument  is  an  array  and the j-entry had an illegal value, then INFO =
               -(i*100+j), if the i-th argument is a scalar and had an illegal value, then INFO = -i.  &gt; 0:   If
               INFO = K, the leading minor of order K,
               A(IA:IA+K-1,JA:JA+K-1)  is  not  positive definite, and the factorization could not be completed,
               and the solution has not been computed.
